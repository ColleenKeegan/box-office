More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Yet this study of comic-book heroism and human destiny challenges rather than meets the audiences expectations. The miraculous sole survivor of a train crash Philadelphia security guard David Dunn (Willis) is told by Elijah Price (Jackson) - a dealer in comic-book art with a fertile imagination and brittle bones - that he is unbreakable. Like indestructible comic-book heroes David has been put on Earth to vanquish evil. The movie then swerves into deeper murkier territory as the bewildered David ponders the cosmic consequences of this knowledge. Is this crazy Biblical soothsayer right? If so does he have a responsibility to develop and use his super-powers? Whereas The Sixth Sense left audiences surprised but surprisingly comfortable this more mature and ambitious movie preserves its ambiguities and keeps everyone guessing. As Davids wife Audrey Wright Penn is mostly sidelined although a brief exchange about their shaky marriage provides the films most compelling emotional moment. If anything the near somnambulant Willis is a little too restrained as if to counter-balance Jacksons flamboyant mesmerising portrayal of the mysterious stranger Elijah.

Jackson in ""Unbreakable."" (Touchstone Pictures) Whatever you ultimately make of ""Unbreakable"" I think youre going to be mesmerized by the experience. Just as he did in ""The Sixth Sense"" writer-director M. Night Shyamalan leads you into a fascinating labyrinth - an alternative universe that lurks right under our noses. In this case its the mythological world and in these modern times the secret design to that labyrinth - the key to the path - is contained in comic books. David Dunn (Bruce Willis) the sole survivor of a massive train wreck is about to learn a great deal about himself destiny and comic books. His rapid education comes from the prophetically named Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) whose scripture derives from such comic adventures as ""Jaguaro."" How could David a soft-spoken security guard from Philadelphia escape a disaster that claimed 131 lives? Elijah a remarkly perceptive man who suffers from a degenerative bone disease that makes him especially vulnerable to fractures has his suspicions. So does Davids adulatory son Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark) who considers his father a true hero. One thing David should know Elijah explains is that comic books arent just comic books. Theyre a form of history. Sure he continues theyre ""jazzed up"" to be sold to young boys. But their mythical stories about good and evil are the modern equivalent of cave paintings or the Odyssey or the Bayeux Tapestry. These comic books tell Elijah vital things about David. He asks David some crucial questions Has he ever been hurt before? Has he ever called in sick? Suddenly David is forced to reassess his entire life at the urging of a questionable stranger. Without getting into the details I think that given the profound mystical questionsthat Shyamalan raises he opts for a relatively complacent conclusion. I dont think this movie is perfect by any means. But its rare to find a film that makes you even hope for perfection. I was hooked from beginning to end. Shyamalans movies are great simply because they have such inspired belief in themselves. They dont just invite the audience to solve the puzzle they ask viewers to look within themselves. And if you willingly follow Shyamalan into his twisting winding premise - which means adopting the para-reality of comic book melodrama - ""Unbreakable"" becomes extremely powerful. Whatever your final verdict you could do worse than enjoy one of the most fertile minds in Hollywood. ""Unbreakable"" (PG-13 107 minutes) - Contains gruesome bone fractures violence and scenes of high emotional intensity.

Jackson Bruce Willis Spencer Treat Clark Robin Wright; Director M. Night Shyamalan; Author M. Night Shyamalan; Producer (group) Limited Edition Productions; Release Date Wide 11/22/2000; Runtime (in minutes) 117; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Touchstone Pictures Posted December 1 2000 -- 1200 AM EST It is one of the primal pleasures of movies to give yourself over to a filmmaker who knows how to seduce the minds eye by teasing his way around what the audience doesnt know. Unbreakable the somberly fantastic new mystery-thriller written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan is even more of an anxiety-drenched trance-out than The Sixth Sense his breakthrough hit of 1999. This picture too is set in Philadelphia but it really takes place in a hushed and disquieting meta-movie world where every new shot is a meditation a sensual piece of the puzzle and where wonder merges with dread. What the pieces add up to is never more alluring than when they have yet to fall into place. Shyamalan is a new-style anomaly -- a lustrous technician enthralled with the poetry of supernatural doom. His films have an atmosphere of richly foreboding ambiguity that seems to fuse the various styles of Hitchcock Nicolas Roeg David Lynch and the Michael Mann of Manhunter. At the same time hes got more gimmicks more movie-derived concepts wired into his nervous system than all of those directors put together. The Sixth Sense had a marvelous creepy intimacy but forgive me for pointing out that its plot a cross between The Shining and Ghost was mostly smoke and mirrors (wouldnt Bruce Willis have tried at least once to have a conversation with somebody other than his wife and Haley Joel Osment?). Unbreakable is a denser subtler even more sophisticated piece of portentous high trickery but by the time the film is over you may feel as if the 12-year-old inside of you has been utterly wowed and that the adult is still going ""Hmmmm..."" Shyamalan intrigues and unsettles us from the outset by introducing scenes and elements that have on the surface nothing to do with each other. An opening title provides statistics about the staggering popularity of comic books and we then cut to the back room of a Philly department store in 1961 where a tearful black woman has just given birth to a baby whose bones are mysteriously broken. The scene as staged carries hints of something larger a disturbance in the universe and that mood carries over to the present day as David Dunn (Bruce Willis) a stadium security guard boards a train slips off his wedding ring and attempts to rouse himself out of what looks like a major depression to flirt with the yuppie hottie who takes the seat next to him. Their encounter realistic as it is seems to come at the audience in its own ominous dream time and its that tone -- a mood of free-floating invisible apocalypse -- that Shyamalan sustains for the remainder of Unbreakable. The train crashes (off screen) and David alone among the passengers emerges from the accident without so much as a scratch. You might describe him as miraculously unharmed except that theres a lingering aura of gloom to his survival. David and his wife Audrey (Robin Wright Penn) are in the midst of a quasi-separation (theyre sleeping in different bedrooms of the same house which they share with their young son) and his mysterious resilience in the face of ineffable psychic damage forms the core of the movie. For much of Unbreakable were hanging on every pinpoint clue such as the anonymous note left on Davids windshield that asks him how often he has been sick. (Answer almost never.) Its revealed that he was a college football star and that theres another eerie vehicular crash in his past. And how exactly is all of this connected to Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) the saturnine owner of a vintage comic-book art gallery? Elijah we learn is that broken-boned baby all grown up. He was born with a congenital disease that results in constant skeletal fractures and he now lives in a lonely protective womb-universe of comic books thats more real to him than the real world. Its Elijah alone who understands why David survived the crash and he begins to divine even greater abilities in him. Jackson looming yet fragile with a stare of the damned and a purple leather coat and walking cane that only enhance his height (he looks like a giant action figure) gives a delicate and haunted performance his finest in years. Willis looks haunted too though his forceful underacting emerging from a sadness that remains unstated occasionally borders on catatonia. Unbreakable works almost too hard to sustain its spell. Its characters are so burdened that every encounter seems time-warped caught in a quicksand of significance and the film began to lose me when David actually starts to harness his newly discovered self. (Youll either go with it or you wont.) That said Shyamalan achieves a premonitory grandeur in his best scenes Elijah in a comic-book store slipping into a silent reckless breakdown; an extended subplot revolving around a hidden weapon that Hitchcock would have been proud to stage; and the amazing moment in which Davids son holds a gun on him in the kitchen a desperate mingling of patricide and love. If Shyamalan ever attains a bit more sway over his inner 12-year-old theres no telling what he could do.

Jackson plays a man with particularly fragile bones in M. Night Shyamalans ""Unbreakable."" Publicity photo Unbreakable Shatters High Expectations / Sixth Sense director repeats his recipe 1 / 1 Back to Gallery RATING (Alert Viewer) UNBREAKABLE Suspense thriller. Starring Bruce Willis Samuel L. Jackson and Robin Wright Penn. Directed and written by M. Night Shyamalan. (PG-13. 107 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In ""Unbreakable"" the new film by ""The Sixth Sense "" director M. Night Shyamalan existential gloom hangs like an emotional decorating scheme. Actors walk slowly the camera circles them portentously and the audience is given the sense that something shattering is about to happen. Theres a lot riding on ""Unbreakable"" which follows Shyamalans 660 million-grossing Oscar-nominated breakthrough. The odds for disappointment if not failure are great and Shyamalan may have lengthened those odds by rushing this film into production to benefit from ""The Sixth Senses"" impact. Instead of making a film thats distinct from ""The Sixth Sense"" he repeats its dark atmosphere ominous pacing and several of its themes and comes up with a pale imitation -- a muddled self-serious snoozer. Bruce Willis who played the sympathetic psychiatrist in ""The Sixth Sense"" is back as David Dunn a football-stadium security guard and sole survivor of a horrendous train wreck. All his life David has never been sick or suffered a scratch; 12 years earlier he survived a car crash that should have killed him. Hes ""unbreakable"" but also profoundly sad a fact that Willis conveys with haunted eyes and a speech pattern that makes him sound overmedicated. While the train wreck brings him closer to his wife (Robin Wright Penn) and his son (Spencer Treat Clark) it also underlines his sense of isolation and survivors guilt. Along comes Elijah Price a very spooky dude played by Samuel L. Jackson in a fuzzy wig and a long duster that suggests a frontier undertaker. Hes Davids opposite a man born with extremely low bone density whose body is so fragile that he came out of the womb with broken legs and arms. Elijah a comic-book connoisseur sees layers of metaphysical significance in Davids superhuman resilience and believes he was delivered to Earth ""to protect the rest of us to guard us"" -- to balance the weakness in others. Extending the psychic theme from ""The Sixth Sense"" Shyamalan also gives Willis character the power to perceive danger before it happens. At the football stadium he spots a drug dealer (played by Shyamalan in a cameo) in the crowd and he knows when a man who brushes past him is about to commit a murder. None of this is adequately resolved or tied together and the result is a story that spins off in several directions and serves up garbled symbolism instead of dramatic truth. Even the surprise ending arrives with a thud and makes us wonder why Shyamalan didnt try something new instead of recycling his ""Sixth Sense"" recipe. Warning to parents ""Unbreakable"" is rated PG-13 but should have gotten an R largely for a scene in which Willis son nearly shoots his dad to determine if hes truly ""unbreakable."" Its a ridiculous moment but for small children it could be upsetting.

Night Shyamalan with ""The Sixth Sense"" a little-anticipated ghost story that became one of the 10 highest grossers of all time. The question of whether this singular writer-director can deliver again will by itself guarantee a large turnout for ""Unbreakable."" If ever a filmmaker vaulted from unknown to lionized status on the basis of one film it was M. Night Shyamalan with ""The Sixth Sense"" a little-anticipated ghost story that became one of the 10 highest grossers of all time. The question of whether this singular writer-director can deliver again will by itself guarantee a large turnout for ""Unbreakable."" The answer is that he delivers much of the same Same star same preoccupation with telepathic and quasi-supernatural/religious powers same hushed tone and deliberate pace same sense of absolute control. But there are also serious differences A weaker story increased pretentiousness some ill-advised narrative zigzags and a ""surprise"" ending that cant begin to compare with the one in his previous picture. In addition to the draw repped by Shyamalan Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson yarn possesses sufficient intrigue to hook audiences and keep them on board much of the way so despite the ultimate sense of letdown B.O. prospects are very sturdy. Following a mysterious prologue revealing the birth in 1961 Philadelphia of a black boy who enters the world with broken arms and legs second scene is so good that it raises what are gradually revealed to be unrealistic expectations. David Dun (Willis) is sitting by the window on a train shuttling to Philadelphia from New York where hes had a presumably unsuccessful job interview. When an attractive young woman Kelly (Leslie Stefanson) sits down next to him he discreetly slips off his wedding ring and quietly chats her up only to see her get up and move when he pushes too far. After putting his ring back on he stares outside at the onrushing scenery until it becomes apparent that the train is moving too fast at which point a cut to Davids son (Spencer Treat Clark) flipping TV channels reveals the news of a terrible derailment. Brief scene obliquely provides all the exposition the viewer needs to know -- the status of Davids marriage his job uncertainty his willingness to move to New York -- while superbly building a quiet sense of unease. Much of it is shot with an agile hand-held camera positioned behind the seats in front of David and Kelly the cuts are all significantly timed and the mix of sounds -- the subdued vocal tones the ambient noise of the train the sudden whoosh of an oncoming diesel -- is wonderfully subtle. Such a sequence establishes a sense of total confidence that one is in the hands of a master storyteller and creates an automatic viewer willingness to follow wherever he chooses to go. Curiosity about where this is headed is further heightened when David turns out to be the sole survivor of the wreck which killed 131 people; in fact he escaped completely unscathed. Now a minor local celebrity David agrees with his wife Audrey (Robin Wright Penn) to use his good fortune to give their dried-up relationship a new lease on life but otherwise returns to his normal routine as a security guard at the university stadium where he was once a football star. But a monkey wrench is introduced in the form of a note David finds on his car reading ""How many days of your life have you been sick?"" In fact David has never taken a sick day and cannot remember ever having been ill and his curiosity is piqued enough for him to track down the notes sender Elijah Price (Jackson) a stern elegant articulate man who walks tentatively with a cane and has transformed his childhood obsession with comics and superheroes into a profession as a gallery dealer selling original comicbook illustrations at extravagant prices. Elijah whose fragile condition was noted in the prologue is preoccupied with strength and heroism due to his own lifelong debility a rare disease that has caused him dozens of bone breaks and years of hospital time. David he suspects could be the man hes long been searching for someone at the opposite end of the spectrum from him invulnerable impervious to disease an individual who ""could protect us."" David is balky and suspicious of such highfalutin conjecture but Elijah keeps after him pushing him to look deeper for the inner potential that David has always ignored. In an unlikely episode Elijah falls while chasing a suspicious character fleeing the football stadium breaking a bunch of bones in the process and who should his rehab therapist turn out to be but Audrey to whom he pours out his theories about the latent extraordinary possibilities within people. David Elijah rightly suspects has a sixth sense as it were for sniffing out evil (properly exploited this could make him a fortune in his chosen field of security); he shortly finds that he possesses the extraordinary intuitive power to enter a crowded room and detect who has committed acts ranging from the untoward to the despicable. He also recalls distant memories of having walked away from a horrible auto accident in which he saved Audreys life and of having almost drowned in a swimming pool which gave him a lifelong fear of water that Elijah maintains is the Achilles heel that all superheroes have. ""Its your kryptonite"" he advises. Some viewers will go along with all this while others like David himself will resist. Because the mystery of where the story might be headed is sustained for so long the film doesnt go off the tracks all at once. But the superhero angle which seems a bit odd when introduced eventually feels all wrong especially when invested with supernatural and spiritual dimensions that seem like holdovers from ""The Sixth Sense."" And while the earlier picture cast the sort of spell that would have been disrupted by any comic relief the presence of pop culture refs via comics makes quite notable the absence of any humor or sense of fun just as it makes its pretentions to deep meaning and self-importance all the more specious. All the same Shyamalans handling of individual sequences is often extremely impressive; he clearly knows exactly what he wants and how to achieve it. This time out he receives a great assist from lenser Eduardo Serra whose widescreen work within a subdued color scheme is enormously textured and arrestingly composed. Also notable among the uniformly excellent craft contributions are Dylan Tichenors precision editing and James Newton Howards supple supportive score. In subdued subtle form Willis gently conveys the essence of a working-class man seemingly beaten down by life but mostly victimized by his own refusal to realize his true potential. Jackson lends his commanding presence and persuasive dialogue delivery to the odd role of Elijah which never becomes fully dimensional enough despite its backstory of tragic vulnerability. Wright Penn doesnt do much with the flatly written wife part and its during some of her domestic scenes with Willis a little more than an hour in that pic goes into lowest gear. As the couples son Clark bears more than a passing resemblance to Haley Joel Osment but the kid plays a decidedly peripheral role in this one.
