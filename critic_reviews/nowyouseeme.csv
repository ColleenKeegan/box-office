Suddenly suspicious their escort orders the guards to search them. The slender chip is attached to a playing card which the Horsemen attempt to conceal through sleight-of-hand tricks amongst themselves. As the pat-down continues the magicians moves grow more elaborate. After a few minutes the card is flying around the room in defiance of all known physical laws--from one Horsemans hand to the bottom of anothers shoe up through another Horsemans sleeve down a pant leg under a collar into a bra and so on. Its like a scene out of a Harry Potter film--but with more Muggles less fun and (somehow) less logic. Related Story The Magicians Sex Drugs and the Supernatural The sequence perhaps captures everything thats wrong with Now You See Me 2 Magic is supposed to inspire wonder even if the audience knows its all smoke and mirrors and hidden trapdoors and misdirection. But very little about this hollow sequel to 2013s heist thriller Now You See Me feels mysterious; its biggest set-pieces will make viewers ask not ""Whoa howd they do that?"" but ""Wait huh?"" At the center of both films are The Four Horsemen a group of illusionists following the orders of an ancient magicians alliance called The Eye. Their ""tests"" often involve exposing corrupt businessmen or giving jilted people their money back which turns them into global heroes and gets them in trouble with the FBI (naturally). The sequel directed by Jon M. Chu takes the worst elements of the first--a bloated plot excessive CGI--and doubles down on them over an exhausting 129-minute running time. Now You See Me 2 (technically titled Now You See Me The Second Act) picks up where its predecessor left off. Hiding from law enforcement the Horsemen have a new leader in Dylan Rhodes the FBI agent who hunted them for the entire first movie only to reveal (spoiler alert) at the end that hes the mastermind feeding the Horsemen their orders as well as the son of a famed late magician. Only three of the original Horsemen remain--the pickpocket Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) the surly J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg) and the hypnotist Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson)--after its one female member (Isla Fisher) bailed. Here shes replaced by a new woman Lula (Lizzy Caplan) who almost immediately points out the tokenism at work ""Im the girl Horseman"" (Indeed its a dude-heavy affair--the gender breakdown may be the most authentic thing about this movie).The action really begins after the Horsemens attempt to hijack the keynote event at Octa an evil Apple-like company goes horribly awry. The gang is split up from Dylan whose double-agent ways are unveiled on live TV forcing him to go on the run. Feeling abandoned the Horsemen find themselves at the mercy of the wealthy and eccentric recluse Walter Maybry played by none other than the actor whose face is synonymous with a very different kind of magic--Daniel Radcliffe. Water gives the Horsemen a choice They can help him steal an Octa-developed computer chip capable of de-encrypting all the data in the world (yes) in exchange for new identities. Or they can die.Also in the Horsemens orbit is an imprisoned ""magic debunker"" named Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) whom Dylan blames for his fathers death and framed out of revenge in the last film. The two begin an uneasy alliance as Dylan tries to locate the missing Horsemen but thats about as sensical as their storyline gets. (On the heels of everyone is an exasperated team of FBI agents who barely register as a threat.)All of which is to say that despite the films constant fourth-wall-breaking dialogue about how ""seeing is not believing"" and ""the eye can lie"" there isnt actually much beneath the surface. Fascinating themes and ideas hover at the margins--the malleability of perception the virtues of inspiring awe in a world where technology has ably supplanted magic--but the film mostly keeps them hidden behind a curtain. Even the movies heavy-handed populist messages about digital privacy and corporate transparency feel strangely remote perhaps because Now You See Me 2 is more invested in making every scene look as cool as humanly possible.Take the absurd card-smuggling scene--only worse than the motion sickness it induced was the sense that the sequence was supposed to be the casual magic lovers equivalent of seeing Don Draper delivering a brilliant ad pitch. Much of the rest of the film is bogged down by obnoxious slow motion slick montages and songs that make you feel like youre walking into a really loud club (though the use of Lil Kim and 50 Cents ""Magic Stick"" at one point was easily one of the highlights). The original film was guilty of much of the same but its plot seems positively streamlined compared to the sequels. By the time Now You See Me 2 enters its final act the audience is prepared for even the most outrageous reversals and tricks (resurrecting a pigeon transporting people to a different continent stopping rain) and that nothing surprises.For the biggest Now You See Me fans there may be enough to make the sequel worth seeing though maybe not in theaters. Caplan as the kooky Lula and Radcliffe as the unhinged Walter are occasional comedic delights despite their thinly written characters. When the films story moves to Macau it has fun playing on the protagonists Western-centric assumptions (when one character brings up Chinese food Merritt remarks ""I think where we are they just call it food""). But for anyone else Now You See Me 2 will strain the limits of patience and belief suspended or otherwise When it comes to this flashy but empty tribute to the wonders of magic seeing really is believing.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

After Khizr Khan spoke politicians and commentators on most networks said they were moved humbled inspired choked up.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

"Now You See Me 2 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; now-you-see-me-2 ) Now You See Me 2 (United States 2016) June 10 2016 A movie review by James Berardinelli 2013s Now You See Me wasnt just about showmanship and misdirection it was showmanship and misdirection. Brought to the screen by the sure hand of director Louis Leterrier this was a triumph of style over substance - a flashy fast-paced caper movie that employed its own brand of illusion to camouflage a surfeit of plot holes and inconsistencies. The film was a surprise hit and as a result the principal characters have been brought back for a return engagement (or at least most of them have). This time around however the magic has fizzled. Based solely on merit Now You See Me 2 is a sequel that should never have been made. There are two reasons why Now You See Me 2 isnt as successful as its predecessor. The freshness is gone. The first movie was an unexpected pleasure; this one comes saddled with the weight of expectations and it cant live up to them. It also isnt as well-written. To be fair many of the tricks and illusions in Now You See Me were accomplished with Hollywood special effects but this time around they are so overblown and unlikely that its impossible to believe a real-life illusionist could accomplish them. The filmmakers are unable to disguise this and it hurts the movies credibility. Following their climactic heist at the end of Now You See Me The Horsemen have gone to ground. After a time their new leader CIA agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) calls them back into service. Returning are master illusionist J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg) hypnotist Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson) and street magician Jack Wilder (Dave Franco). Replacing Isla Fishers Henley Reeves is Lizzy Caplans Lula - after all The Horsemen need a little estrogen to go along with all that testosterone. Joining returning bad guys Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) and Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine) is Daniel Radcliffes Walter. Radcliffe of course is no stranger to magic but on this occasion he wants to hire/blackmail others into doing it for him. The goal is a godlike computer circuit board that will allow the possessor to have access to everyones private information. Part of the fun of Now You See Me was watching how the heroes would use magic to escape various untenable situations. Now You See Me 2 re-applies the formula but does it using deus ex machina resolutions. The ""solution"" to the first big trick (which involves a pipeline from New York City to Macau China) is so contrived its not worth contemplation and theres nothing director Jon M. Chu (who has a long history of helming sequels) can do to obfuscate its idiocy. Things dont get better from there. Every time the movie explains a trick were left shaking our heads. In order for the climactic illusion to work all the victims would have to be utter morons. This may not be among the dumbest screenplays of the year but its among the most disappointing ones. Acting and showmanship two hallmarks of Now You See Me are curiously muted in the second installment. Theres a lot of Oscar power in the cast - 17 nominations and three wins - but the performers in Now You See Me 2 are just saying their dialogue and having fun. Theres not a lot of urgency or suspense. And unlike in most caper films were not invested in the crafty scheme the characters are planning for the heist because we know it will involve Hollywood magic and therefore wont be plausible or interesting. As for the showmanship aspect - the Horsemen only do two live performances. The first is truncated and the second is excruciatingly unbelievable in terms of what it delivers. Suspense of disbelief is crucial for a movie like Now You See Me 2. For the original movie the filmmaking was such that we were willing and able to get to that point. Not so this time. The seams are visible we see the man behind the curtain and the sleight-of-hand isnt quick enough. The concept of a gang of magicians operating as international spies has potential but this entry (into what is planned as a long-running series) represents a significant miscalculation. Whether or not audiences pull a disappearing act Now You See Me 2 doesnt bring magic back to the multiplex. Now You See Me 2 (United States 2016) Director Jon M.

But the big reveal that Morgan Freemans skeptical antagonist lays on Mark Ruffalos wounded trickster at the end of this sequel to 2013s surprise hit about magician bank robbers is more likely to have you screwing up your face in puzzlement and asking ""WTF?"" That is if youre taking any of it seriously by that point. Once more with feeling a group of talented individuals must learn to overcome their personal foibles and function as a team -- sorry as a single organism -- in order to stop a villain bent on controlling the worlds computers. The early appearance of Lizzy Caplan as a fake-violence specialist who once pulled a hat out of a rabbit is enough to inspire hope but dont be fooled. She quickly devolves into a love interest/sad quipstress leaving the odd spotlight to Woody Harrelson goofing as his own twin. And of course theres no danger of mistaking computer-enhanced trickery for actual sleight of hand so even the modest but honest pleasure provided by quality card work is compromised.

Brad Wheeler The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 10 2016 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Jun. 10 2016 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Jon M. Chu Written by Ed Solomon Starring Jesse Eisenberg Woody Harrelson Dave Franco Daniel Radcliffe Classification PG Genre thriller Year 2016 Country USA Language English Is the follow-up to the 2013 heist-y abracadabra hit Now You See Me as enjoyable as the original? Do you believe in magic? The answer to the first question is dependent on the answer to the second. Now You See Me 2 is just as cheerfully outlandish as the caper flicks precursor with the acceptance of fancy tricks and misdirection twists dependent on an audiences love of a good hoodwink. And not just the hoodwink but the hoodwinkers. Back to pull wool over eyes and banter snappily are the apparently lovable characters Danny Atlas (a brash illusionist played by Jesse Eisenberg) Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson in a pork pie hat as a wisecracking hypnotist) and Jack Wilder (the pickpocket genius and card-trick wizard played by Dave Franco).Not returning is Isla Fisher whose role as the escapist has not been reprised. In her place is Lizzy Caplan as Lula a pepper-pot prankster played effervescently. She once pulled a hat out of a rabbit so she fits right in. ""An addition of femininity to the group over and above that which [Danny] provides"" quips Harrelsons spellbinder.Together they are the Four Horsemen a snazzy showoff troupe led by a sort-of fifth member Dylan Rhodes. Played again by Mark Ruffalo Rhodes is an FBI agent supposedly on the Horsemens trail for their Robin Hood-type crime of the first movie. Its a ruse though. Hes also the son of a dead master magician and it was his scheme to get the Horsemen together to swipe money from an insurance tycoon (Michael Caine) whose company failed to compensate his family when it came to his dads decades-ago wrongful death case.Caine is back and so is Morgan Freeman as Thaddeus Bradley a ""magic debunker"" left holding the bag for the first films heist. Bradley is one of those mysteriously wise characters upon which Freeman has built his career. Hes in prison - no Shawshank situation here; he eats lobster for dinner - when the sequel begins.So now you see them. And now you see them again.""Magic"" someone says ""is about controlling perception."" Same goes for filmmaking. At times the glittering Now You See Me 2 is slick like Mission Impossible or Oceans Eleven. But its quirky enough that its implausibility is excused. A series of merely improbable ploys serve as a set up so that by the time we get to the preposterous show-stopping stunt at the end were willing to buy just about anything.Anything including a disturbingly bearded Daniel Radcliffe as the ""narcissistic man-boy"" villain Walter Mabry. The illegitimate son of Caines mogul character Mabry is a tech magnate hiding off the grid in Macau the ""Las Vegas of Asia"" and historically a magic-world hot spot. He coerces the Four Horsemen into stealing a fantastic new computer ""stick"" for him.Jon M. Chu (Justin Bieber Never Say Never and G.I. Joe Retaliation) didnt direct the first film but he keeps things tight and moving swiftly for the sequel. One quibble though is the crazy length of a card-trick episode involving the stolen stick and some sleight-of-hand choreography. If the illusion exists to saw a woman in two surely Cho could chop this scene in half. And as far as plot conveniences lets just say having a master hypnotist character is pretty darn handy.In real life of course nobody can be hypnotized against their will. To be mesmerized is to willingly succumb. Just keep that in mind when you head off to see something like Now You See Me 2.

A bad one will leave you checking your wallet making sure he didnt steal any of your bills.""Now You See Me 2"" straddles the line between the two and tips toward the latter.Like its predecessor which was a surprise hit in 2013 ""Now You See Me 2"" is a slick empty and consequence-free diversion. Its a little smug and self-satisfied and it attempts to fool you into thinking its a highly calculated skillfully plotted caper that is always three steps ahead of the audience. But thats just another of its tricks.Danny Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg) and Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson) are back as the leaders of the Four Horsemen a team of rock star magicians who in the first film acted as Robin Hood types by stealing from the rich and giving back to the little people. This made them celebrity figures and wanted criminals which was apparently too much for Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher) to handle. Shes now gone explained away in a few lines of expository dialogue replaced by Lula (Lizzy Caplan) in a move that barely registers as a blip on the Horsemens radar.Also hanging around in the better-than-it-needs-to-be cast are Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) the Horsemens understudy and resident card expert; Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) the FBI agent whos tracking the Horsemen but is secretly the brains of the operation; Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) the incarcerated magic expert who has vowed to take down the Horsemen; and Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine) the insurance magnate who was ripped off by the Horsemen in the first film.New on board is Walter Mabry (Daniel Radcliffe) the son of Tressler who aims to get the Horsemen to steal a data card that in essence unlocks the personal information of every cell phone user on the planet. Ta-daWhat unfolds is basically ""Mission Impossible"" for dummies. Not that the ""Mission Impossible"" movies are highly intellectual fare but theyre built on intricate set pieces that unfold as daring tension-filled highwire acts. ""Now You See Me 2"" cheats its way through those sequences cheapening the entire experience.At the center of the film theres a scene in which each of the Horsemen is passing a playing card to the others while various security agents pat them down in a high-level vault. In the right hands this could be a thrilling and daring chain of events. But director Jon M. Chu (""Step Up"" 2 and 3) employs so much digital fakery and so many physical impossibilities that the scene loses all its sense of danger and risk. As soon as you dont believe its happening the trick loses all of its meaning.At least the cast is having fun. Harrelson doubles himself also playing a goof-off twin brother who seems at least partially inspired by Matthew McConaughey his co-star on ""True Detective."" Caplan given almost nothing to work with besides her own sense of fearlessness gives life to her character with her offbeat sense of comic timing. But its Radcliffe who seems to be having the most fun relishing his villain role and showing the most presence he has outside of ""Harry Potter."" In an action comedy he could really pop.But as the illusions mount they dont amount to much leading up to a big finale that piles on the improbabilities and quietly sweeps them under the rug.""The best tricks work on many levels"" Freemans character explains at one point as he attempts to give weight to the Horsemens -- and the movies -- actions. Instead he reminds viewers this is a one-dimensional enterprise.

"Review The hocus pocus of Now You See Me 2 wears thin Skip to main content Latest News The Conversation Review The hocus pocus of Now You See Me 2 wears thin By JAKE COYLE Jun. 8 2016 730 PM EDT Share article 5 photos In this image released by Summit Entertainment Woody Harrelson left and Dave Franco appear in a scene from ""Now You See Me 2."" (Jay Maidment/Summit Entertainment vis AP) i By JAKE COYLE (AP)Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed.The magician heist movie ""Now You See Me 2"" disappears with not a poof but in a hyper-kinetic blur of hectic plot mechanics ceaselessly nattering characters and so many ploys of misdirection that the films own direction got lost up someones sleeve long ago. Now you see it now you dont. Did you care that you saw it? Why did you see it anyway? Is that why you look like you need a nap? Yet the cast is one reason to catch Jon M. Chus sequel to the surprise 2013 hit. Its an odd assortment but a talented one that includes Woody Harrelson Mark Ruffalo Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine. They dont get the chance to sink their teeth into anything much but in the summertime you usually need to buy a ticket to a superhero movie for such an ensemble. And theres something almost quaint about the two ""Now You See Me"" films. They are diverting and harmless and the fate of the world pleasantly does not hang in the balance. Theyre perfect for fans of ""Oceans Eleven"" that are looking for weaker filmmaking a little less star power and a whole lot more playing cards. In ""Now You See Me 2"" the Four Horsemen having gone into hiding following their Las Vegas exploits of the first film return. Theyre a group of magicians led -- curiously given the alternatives -- by Jesse Eisenbergs slight-of-hand artist. The others are Harrelsons hypnotist Dave Francos street magician and a new addition played by Lizzy Caplan (replacing Isla Fisher) whose sarcastic flare steals the movie. The Horsemen are like a fantasy dreamed by David Copperfield a co-producer whose show inspired the films. When not trying to one-up each others tricks the Horsemen perform feats of illusion that unmask real corruption. In the world of ""Now You See Me"" they are extravagantly (and bizarrely) famous cheered by mobs on the streets and pursued in vain by the feds (Ruffalo plays the lead agent). In ""Now You See Me 2"" their flashy return is spoiled by a wealthy tech whiz in hiding (Daniel Radcliffe) who constructs an elaborate revenge against the magicians that transports them around the globe to Macau presumably for the purpose of drawing in Chinese moviegoers. The movie scripted by Ed Solomon is such a constant barrage of absurdly implausible tricks followed by explanations of how they were done that ""Now You See Me 2"" feels like the work of a feverish manic magician who cant stop pulling rabbits out of hats. Chu a veteran of multiple Justin Bieber documentaries and several ""Step Up"" films cracks up the pace and never holds a shot much longer than a second. And when everything is a manipulation -- one illusion after another -- nothing comes as a surprise. It feels like a lost opportunity because both ""Now You See Me"" films have a pleasant enough preposterousness. Its hard to dislike a movie that adds a curly-haired evil twin brother for Woody Harrelson. But magic always feels a little redundant in the movies. By itself cinema is a grand magic act that never gives away its tricks (well except for director commentaries on DVDs). Maybe thats why ""Now You See Me 2"" cant slow down. It knows its always being upstaged by the hocus pocus of its own medium. ""Now You See Me 2"" a Summit Entertainment release is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""violence and some language."" Running time 126 minutes. Two stars out of four. ___ Follow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at http//twitter.com/jakecoyleAP SEE FULL ARTICLE Advertisement SEE COMMENTS Comments Discuss this story on Twitter or Facebook AP on TwitterAP on Facebook Advertisement Advertisement Topics Justin Bieber Isla Fisher Morgan Freeman Woody Harrelson Michael Caine Jesse Eisenberg Daniel Radcliffe Mark Ruffalo Lizzy Caplan David Copperfield Dave Franco Advertisement AP Radio News Your browser does not support the audio element.

The only thing more headache-inducing than the setup of a long con is the supposed payoff at the end. Even the main characters groan in frustration in the last minutes of this film when theyre told theyre not going to get answers to most of their questions. Gee thanks. The best disappearing act in the sequel to the 2013 moderate box-office hit is performed by Isla Fisher who was in the original but is nowhere in sight for the sequel. Ta da ""Now You See Me 2"" boasts quite the impressive cast two Academy Award winners in Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine three Oscar nominees in Woody Harrelson Mark Ruffalo and Jesse Eisenberg and a likable supporting cast including Lizzy Caplan Sanaa Lathan Dave Franco and Daniel Radcliffe. Not a one of them escapes the chains of a nearly indecipherable plot loads of clunky dialogue an overload of sweeping overhead shots action sequences cut so rapidly theyre practically in fast motion an intrusive obnoxious score and so many special effects theres nothing magical at all about the magic. Its not sleight-of-hand; its CGI masquerading as the art of misdirection. Three of the four globally famous Robin Hood magicians -- Jesse Eisenbergs Atlas Woody Harrelsons Merritt and Dave Francos Jack -- have been underground for a year patiently awaiting their next assignment from the mysterious and all-powerful group known only as The Eye. (The absence of Isla Fishers Henley is explained in a throwaway line and then poof Lizzy Caplans Lula joins the Horsemen.) Mark Ruffalos Dylan is an FBI agent but hes also the leader of the Horsemen and their conduit to The Eye. Meanwhile Morgan Freemans magic-debunker Thaddeus Bradley is in prison biding his time and plotting his revenge against Dylan and the Horsemen for (he claims) framing him for crimes he didnt commit. The Horsemen emerge from their self-imposed exile in spectacular fashion hijacking a tech companys product launch to expose its insidious privacy-invading gadgetry -- but the tables are turned on the Horsemen who suddenly find themselves in Macau and congratulations to the Sands Macao Hotel and Casino for some fantastic and blatant branding placement. Now its the Horsemen who are being pursued by myriad forces that want them behind bars or dead. Daniel Radcliffe hams it up as Walter Mabry an insane business mogul who faked his own death and now wants the Horsemen to steal an all-important computer chip for him. (Francos Jack also faked his own death and thats at least one faked-death subplot too many.) If they dont comply hell have them killed. (We get a number of scenes in which the Horsemen are punched kicked and pushed around by various thugs. Theyre supposedly the greatest escape artists in the world but they cant seem to escape the clutches of punch-happy henchmen.) Michael Caine returns as Arthur Tressler the evil insurance magnate who was bilked of millions by the Horsemen and now wants HIS revenge. (Judging by Tresslers Trumpian lifestyle he must have had a few hundred million squirreled away.) And if things werent crowded enough Harrelson plays his own twin brother a cackling psychopath who hates his sibling. In a career filled with interesting performances Harrelsons work as the weirdo twin is not one of those performances. Its a disaster. In fact ""NYSM2"" brings out the worst in so many talented actors. Caplan overplays her comedic punch lines Ruffalo seems almost uninterested in his own work Caine and Freeman are phoning it in and Eisenberg and Franco fall short of conveying the supposedly endless onstage charisma of their respective characters. Director Jon M. Chu (whose credits include ""Jem and the Holograms"" a couple of ""Step Up"" sequels and ""G.I. Joe Retaliation"") is obsessed with flashy moves and knows how to deliver attractive visuals but hes not so well versed when it comes to elaborately choreographed set pieces. Just one example a scene in which the Horseman play keep-away with a playing card containing a priceless totem is clunky and utterly unconvincing. More than once characters in ""Now You See Me 2"" make references to pulling back the curtain a la ""The Wizard of Oz."" At one point theres an actual curtain and the Horsemen swing that curtain open ... And whats behind that curtain is just as much of an incomprehensible jab at the audience as everything else in this film. Now You See Me 2 one and a half stars Summit Entertainment presents a film directed by Jon M. Chu and written by Ed Solomon. Running time 129 minutes. Rated PG-13 (for violence and some language).

And that in a nutshell is what this globe-hopping caper starring a team of magician thieves is. Sure the magic arts are all about misdirection and trickery. But the best illusionists make their audiences feel like theyve just witnessed something substantive - the impossible art and alchemy combined. In Now You See Me 2 audiences can witness plenty of whooshing visual effects - a playing card that goes zigzagging around a room raindrops that stop in midair and fly back up to the sky bodies that poof and disappear - but theyre the work of animators and compositors rotoscopers and digital artists. Its the magic of movies not a movie that comes close to achieving real magic. Now You See Me 2 starts in 1982 in New Jersey - with a boy his beloved escape-artist dad and a big safe dropped into a river. The whats and wherefores of this prologue are explained soon enough. Morgan Freemans Thaddeus Bradley a debunker of magic who played a pivotal role in the first film and is now doing time behind bars has a few things to say and then director Jon M. Chus camera finds Jesse Eisenbergs J. Daniel Atlas cloaked in a hoodie on a dark lonely street descending into the sewers of New York. No he is not looking for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Instead hes waiting for news from a secret society called the Eye to find out what his next assignment might be. He returns to his apartment to encounter the stalker-ish Lula (Lizzy Caplan from Showtimes Masters of Sex) a stranger who knows all about Atlas and who displays some impressive hocus-pocus chops of her own thus qualifying her to fill the slot left by the original films Isla Fisher (reportedly unable to do the sequel because she was pregnant). Lula becomes ""the girl Horseman"" - the other Horsemen being Atlas McKinney and the master pickpocket and cardsharp Jack Wilder (Dave Franco). And so like Ethan Hunts Impossible Missions gang the Four Horsemen are off and running (galloping?) on a head-spinning plot-thickening adventure. This one involves Walter Mabry (a seriously bearded Daniel Radcliffe) a duplicitous tech entrepreneur and magic fan who orchestrates the elaborate abduction of the Horsemen. Presto change-o everyones in Macau. Our heroes aided by FBI guy and closet illusionist Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) must extricate themselves from Mabrys clutches learn a few things from a Mandarin-speaking magic-shop proprietress and also put on a big New Years Eve show in London so millions of fans can ooh and aah. Director Chu veteran of a pair of Step Up dance movies and two Justin Bieber documentaries knows how to create a zoomy sense of movement.

Warner Bros. Pictures hide caption toggle caption Warner Bros. Pictures Judy Warren (Sterling Jerins) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) in The Conjuring 2. Warner Bros. Pictures The most telling aspect of The Conjuring 2 the gonzo sequel to the 2013 horror smash is that its 133 minutes long. A running time like that is a rarity--The Exorcist at 132 minutes may be the strongest analogue--because the genre draws intensity from concision and its dread-soaked mysteries are not so easily sustained over time. But director James Wan who made the seventh The Fast and the Furious entry between the two Conjuring movies has figured out how to adapt the genre to the blockbuster age when studios are batting for a home run every time they step to the plate. This is no mere haunted house movie. This is a tour through a giant spring-loaded funhouse. For evidence of Wans horror maximalism look no further than the opening sequence which finds real-life ghostbusters Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) Warren holding a seance at the famed Dutch Colonial in Amityville before moving onto something bigger. Consider that for a moment Scary happenings at the Amityville house--second only in horror iconography to the Bates house in Psycho the subject of 14 movies (and counting) and numerous works of fiction nonfiction and semi-fiction--are a mere throat-clearing for The Conjuring 2. Wans last feature had cars parachuting from a plane onto a mountain pass. This one has a room full of crosses that get twisted upside-down like a doorknob to the gates of hell. Like any director of a blockbuster sequel he takes the mandate to top himself seriously. The Conjuring 2 mostly justifies the bloat because Wans style is wonderfully energized and nimble with a camera that roves quickly sometimes madly toward danger and a restless escalation of stakes. He also has legitimately compelling lead characters in Ed and Lorraine whose profession and marriage the movies take seriously even if the real world received them more skeptically. After a vision at Amityville prophecies her husbands death and brings a frightening new demon into her conscience Lorraine insists they take a step back from active casework and act strictly as consultants instead. It doesnt happen of course but the depth of feeling between them gives the supernatural threat more weight. Seven years after Amityville Ed and Lorraine are summoned to a modest old home in the London borough of Enfield where single mother Peggy Hodgson (Frances OConner) and her four children are besieged by a poltergeist. Peggys youngest daughter Janet (Madison Wolfe) has been haunted and occasionally possessed by an exceedingly cranky old spirit who wants the Hodgsons out of his home. The Warrens are called in by the Church in an unofficial capacity but as their skepticism falls away their mission to help the spiritually afflicted draws them into the fight. As with The Conjuring and his two Insidious movies Wan lifts from a generous smorgasbord of influences combining the urban possession of The Exorcist and the multi-dimensional child abduction of Poltergeist with Spielbergian moments of humor and wonder. Never much for gore--even Saw his extreme-horror breakthrough is more about pain than plasma--Wan instead amplifies the scares with old-fashioned effects and a hyper-aggressive soundtrack. There are at least five or six full-body shivers in The Conjuring 2 and most of them come through jump-scares done right with each ghoulish surprise punctuated by blasts of unholy guttural noise. Theres nothing particularly distinctive about The Conjuring 2 which is more about repurposing old effects than adding new ones. (Its generic qualities extend to the music cues. When the action shifts to London Wan cuts a montage to The Clashs ""London Calling"" which was recorded two years after the movie takes place.) What it lacks in originality however it makes up in moxie. Wan turns the Hodgson residence into whirring gizmo of demonic effects--a self-propelled fire truck a zoetrope come to life a leather recliner of the damned--that never stops moving. Its like the Hodgsons have taken up residence inside a sharks mouth and the beast is relentlessly chewing. Wan brings the monster vividly to life and in its scaled-up hokum The Conjuring 2 charts a future for studio horror.

Credit Jay Maidment/Lionsgate The main sleight-of-hand at play in the illusion-themed sequel ""Now You See Me 2"" will be convincing audiences that a single oddball idea -- and four bickering bragging leads -- can support a successful franchise. And while the first movie had a certain goofy charm its appeal barely stretched to feature length. This time the director Louis Leterrier has been replaced by Jon M. Chu who with ""G.I. Joe Retaliation"" (2013) has proved himself more than comfortable with noise and nonsense.And this cartoonish movie has plenty of both. A brief recap reminds us that the so-called Four Horsemen -- Las Vegas magicians played by Woody Harrelson Dave Franco Jesse Eisenberg and Lizzy Caplan (replacing Isla Fisher as the token she-geek) -- are lying low after robbing a casino in Paris. Called out of hiding by their handler-cum-F.B.I. agent (an essential Mark Ruffalo) our prestidigitators must steal a tech doodad that can control all the worlds computers.Technology might be the enemy of the plot but its the best friend of a movie that bounces from New York to Macau and from one stupendously slick stunt to another. Everything is supersized and preposterous but Mr. Chu with two films in the ""Step Up"" franchise under his belt is undaunted by crowds and confusion. As is Peter Demings cinematography which uses speed and shadow to blur the ludicrousness of the cons and fake-outs.But the film is an emotional black hole its insufferably smug tricksters augmented by Mr. Harrelson -- wearing too many teeth and a wig reminiscent of ""Dont Look Now""-era Donald Sutherland -- as his characters identical twin. They never let us forget that their chief superpowers are glibness and ego.""Now You See Me 2"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). One bra two beheadings and an avalanche of boasting.

Jesse Eisenberg plays street illusionist Daniel in ""Now You See Me 2."" Photo Jay Maidment TNS Now You See Me 2 Magical tricks not-so-magical script 1 / 1 Back to Gallery In ""Now You See Me 2"" super-antihero magicians from the first film come out of hiding -- in plain sight naturally -- for another round of razzle-dazzle that will save the world from the evil 0.00001 percent. Its anyones guess what these trickster rabble-rousers have been doing with themselves for the past few years other than flicking around cards at warp speed and perhaps streaming David Copperfield videos. But a mysterious source summons the gang into action and with a proverbial wave of the wand the convoluted proceedings get under way. The story doesnt make a lick of sense of course but this sleight-of-hand movie is all about the smoke and mirrors and it doesnt pretend to be anything else except when its delivering a few hollow lamentations about income inequality. Like the original the sequel is a string of elaborate tricks that range from the merely implausible to the utterly preposterous. Your enjoyment of the movie will depend on whether you can suspend your disbelief -- and confusion -- and let the magic of misdirection wash over you. Sometimes its easy to do just that. The best set pieces are at the beginning when the ""Four Horsemen"" tricksters get a taste of their own medicine and near the end when the elusive magicians stage a whopper of a caper that gives the villains their ultimate comeuppance. But the films script offers little in the way of magic for its characters who might as well be trapped in one of Houdinis water chambers. The first film offered some wisecracking between street illusionist Daniel (Jesse Eisenberg) and hypnotist Merritt (Woody Harrelson) but in the new installment they barely talk to each other. Instead Harrelson spends his time warring with his evil twin brother (a bad idea) and Eisenberg is stranded without a sparring partner (a really bad idea). The character of another Horseman Jack (Dave Franco) is so skimpily written that Jack could disappear into thin air and no one would notice. Faring better is Lizzy Caplan who plays the new kid on the block Lula with much welcome pluckiness. Despite being among the most-wanted fugitives in the world the Horsemen need only about 30 seconds to accept this new member into their very exclusive world. But again plausibility is not the order of the day here. We are also supposed to believe that these rebels are a tight-knit family but there is no meaningful interaction between them despite the films two-hour-plus running time. Instead its either exposition or tricks even when many of the stunts (particularly in the midsection) do little to advance the story. Theres no arguing that theres a clever concept that anchors the ""Now You See Me"" franchise -- expect more sequels -- but razzle-dazzle and the art of misdirection can take you only so far. The magic has to be in the details too. David Lewis is a Bay Area writer. Now You See Me 2 Action thriller. Starring Jesse Eisenberg Woody Harrelson Lizzy Caplan Morgan Freeman. Directed by John Chu.

Even louder and more rambling than its ludicrous predecessor Jon M. Chus excruciatingly incoherent Now You See Me 2 once again follows the rogue magician group the Four Horsemen through their ostentatious escapades and faux-liberal endeavors. Forget what trick-debunker Morgan Freeman says You dont have to see this to believe it (or see it at all). But if you do insist have some migraine medication handy for headache-inducing hypnosis partly administered by not one but two Woody Harrelsons--this time hes got a twin brother doubling the dim-witted humor. Thats not the only update to the cast. In Isla Fishers absence the Horsemens sole female spot is filled by the overeager Lula (Lizzy Caplan). Sure a line of dialogue owns up to this gender imbalance but whether thats to clear the screenwriters conscience or flip the female audience off were not sure. The plot? Theres an excess of it and yet none to speak of. Living in hiding after a series of Robin Hood-esque robbery stunts the group reemerges in Chinas Macau to steal a chip for a tech billionaire (Daniel Radcliffe surrounded by crude Muggle magic). Its a complex scheme that eventually leads to a deafening London finale and every Edward Snowden fans wet-dream digital privacy not the strongest dramatic climax. Even the one memorable sequence--in which the troupe dexterously pass around a playing card during an extended heist--lacks the Oceans 11 sophistication the film is after. Now You See Me 2 routinely chases its own tail debunking the audiences spell at every turn.

(Credit Lionsgate Movies) advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The magicians known as the Four Horsemen return to hoodwink a technology mogul.CAST Mark Ruffalo Jesse Eisenberg Woody Harrelson Lizzy CaplanRATED PG-13 (Some violence and startling imagery)LENGTH 209BOTTOM LINE Twice as preposterous and half as fun as the original. Theres suspension of disbelief and then theres the profound gullibility it would take to enjoy ""Now You See Me 2"" a sequel to 2013s magic-themed heist movie. That films flashy illusions and last-minute escapes stretched credibility but at least it added up to an entertaining action-thriller. The sequel is twice as preposterous and half as fun. If you havent seen the first film youll need help with the back story. We now know that FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) was only pretending to track the Robin Hood-style magicians called the Four Horsemen while actually masterminding their implausible robberies. A professional debunker Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) ended up taking the fall -- just one example of the movies tendency toward unnecessary plot twists. Well see more of those here. advertisement | advertise on newsday Screenwriter Ed Solomon shuffles around our heroes like a game of four-card monte Back in action are arrogant illusionist J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg grating) and cocky mentalist Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson still enjoyable) while sleight-of-hand artist Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) is now also a mentalist confusingly. Isla Fishers Henley Reeves has bowed out replaced by Lizzy Caplan as Lula an irritating chatterbox with a penchant for gory tricks. When we first meet her she chops off her own head. A serviceable Daniel Radcliffe plays the villain Walter Mabry a sprightly tech mogul whose latest chip is a phone-invading all-surveilling market-rigging wonder. Cue the Horsemens usual strident populism ""Theyre selling privacy to boost profits"" Lula tells an outraged crowd. Ah but this time the Horsemen have met their match. Perhaps theyll find help in Macau home to a legendary magic shop run by young Li (Jay Chou ""The Green Hornet""). Aside from Harrelson in a double role (he plays Merritts slightly effeminate twin Chase) ""Now You See Me 2"" packs few surprises or new ideas. Director Jon M. Chu replacing Louis Leterrier goes for mawkish sentiment more than thrills -- a grave error given these characters shallowness. What really nags though is that the movie makes so little sense even within its own reality-challenged world. Near the end when Freemans Thaddeus is asked to answer the films central emotional and logistical question he gives the only answer anyone can ""I dont know.""

Photo Jay Maidment MOVIE REVIEW NOW YOU SEE ME 2 129 minutes. Rated PG-13 (profanity violence). ""Horsemen reappear in London; world holds its breath"" blares a newspaper headline in this sequel rather overestimating the worlds fascination with magicians -- as well as its recall of the first movie which was three years ago and not all that memorable even then. ""Now You See Me 2"" resurrects the gang of magician/benevolent con artists known as the Four Horsemen. Jesse Eisenberg works in his comfort zone as neurotic genius J. Daniel Atlas; Dave Franco is card sharp Jack Wilder; Woody Harrelson is both hypnotist Merritt McKinney and this time around his evil twin brother differentiated with a terrible perm. The best decision director Jon M. Chu (""Jem and the Holograms"") makes is adding Lizzy Caplan whose character Lula (replacing Isla Fisher) is the highlight of this convoluted implausible film. ""Im the girl horseman Woo-hoo"" she announces with an extra helping of wry as she proceeds to steal every scene shes in with impressive comedic sleight-of-hand. Mark Ruffalo also returns as Dylan Rhodes the groups ringleader -- and so maybe a Horseman himself. But wouldnt that make them the Five Horsemen which isnt really a saying? This is one of so many blurry details throughout the too-long plot which sees the group recruited by a criminal mastermind to steal smartphone software that will enable its owner to (what else?) take over the world. Dylan is also somehow an FBI agent tasked with tracking the Horsemen even though his colleagues (David Warshofsky Sanaa Lathan) suspect him of being one which casts serious doubts on the FBIs vetting program. The gang resurfaces in New York to showily humiliate a tech mogul with designs on privacy invasion and instead ends up in a casino in Macau where their captor (Daniel Radcliffe vamping merrily) informs them of their new mission. Michael Caine makes a weary repeat appearance as the financier fleeced in the last movie as does Morgan Freemans professional skeptic Thaddeus Bradley narrating in tedious metaphors about how ""theres always more than whats on the surface."" Thats one claim this shallow sequel simply cant back up.

Assembling this cast from left Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson) Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) Walter Mabry (Daniel Radcliffe) Lula (Lizzy Caplan) and J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg). (Jay Maidment/Lionsgate) For every nitpicker who found fault with ""Now You See Me"" and there were plenty of you there were probably two more viewers who just didnt give a hoot that the 2013 magic-themed thriller made no sense whatsoever. The flashy yet confounding sleight of hand plot and camera that were on display -- along with rollicking performances by a cast that included Morgan Freeman Michael Caine Jesse Eisenberg Woody Harrelson Mark Ruffalo and Melanie Laurent -- made the film a hit at the box office if not with critics. (Rotten Tomatoes elite reviewers gave the film a score of 26 percent while 70 percent of audiences liked it.) Predictably the story of four Robin Hood-like prestidigitators who use elaborate tricks to expose corruption spawned a sequel with twice as much of what the hoi polloi loved and the haters hated. ""Now You See Me 2"" is bigger brasher more unabashed and if possible even more headache-inducing -- at least for anyone who expects a movie to answer half of the questions it raises. Although a few of the films secrets are revealed as in the first film many more are not. Not in ways that pass close scrutiny at any rate. One scene from the trailer for instance in which Eisenbergs pretentiously named magician J. Daniel Atlas appears to make raindrops hover in mid-air -- and then float upward -- is explained as the effect of a rain machine and strobe lights. Fair enough. The levitating-water illusion is so common you can buy one on Amazon. But when Danny as he is called proceeds to disappear into the wet pavement leaving behind only a heap of soggy clothing there is no explanation. Never mind that magician Criss Angel performed similar head-scratching feats on his old ""Mindfreak"" show. Or that this kind of thing is just another day at the office for showman David Copperfield who is a co-producer on the film. Like knives from a knife thrower so many similar illusions are flung at you in ""NYSM2"" -- several of which seem to rely on camera and editing cheats as much as magical stagecraft -- that the razzle-dazzle quickly can become painful. Observing magic in the flesh is one thing. But watching a movie which is its own kind of wizardry shouldnt feel like the wool is being pulled over your eyes. Set 18 months after the events of the first film ""NYSM2"" opens with Danny and his fellow Horsemen as the altruistic magicians are known in hiding. In an exposition that is almost too briskly efficient we learn that Lizzy Caplan as Lula has replaced Isla Fisher as ""the girl Horseman"" to use her refreshingly self-aware phrase joining Harrelsons mentalist Merritt and Dave Francos ""cardistry"" expert Jack. Their mentor Dylan (Ruffalo) a magician who is masquerading as an F.B.I. agent acts as their liaison to the secret magic society known as the Eye from which they take their marching orders. When the group is abducted by a nefarious tech entrepreneur (Daniel Radcliffe) in order to steal a computer chip capable of accessing any computer in the world the setup is in place for a twisty ""Oceans Eleven""-style romp. ""Im having fun even if youre not"" says Radcliffes Walter a sociopathic Steve Jobs in a white suit. The sequence in which the Horsemen are spirited away -- after jumping off a rooftop in Manhattan into a plastic construction tube and coming out the other end in Macau China -- is one of the films unmitigated delights even if the subsequent revelation of the mechanism behind it is not entirely credible. Another showstopping sequence involves a playing card being palmed thrown and moved through clothing in ways that defy both physics and credulity. Dannys shopping list for that scene includes a ""Kepplinger holdout"" (a mechanical device that pulls a card out of your hand and up your sleeve) and ""roughing fluid"" (used to make cards sticky). Such esoteric touches make the magic seem authentic but how is it that security guards dont find the holdout when they are patting Danny down? Hypnosis in both films is central to justifying an absurd array of improbable behaviors here (well beyond barking like a dog). The film presents alpha-wave trances as occurring with the speed and ease of a finger snap. Without them the movie falls apart like a house of cards. Notwithstanding these serious flaws the film is at times almost sinfully fun assuming you have a taste for self-indulgently logic-free hedonism. Directed by Jon M. Chu -- known for two ""Step Up"" films a Justin Bieber concert documentary and ""G.I. Joe Retaliation"" -- the movie is all eye candy tasty and stimulating but not very good for you. Not that theres anything wrong with a little escapism. But too often ""NYSM2"" gets tangled in its straitjacket of a plot leaving the movie twisting in the wind upside down. It doesnt care. To paraphrase Walter the movie is having fun even if youre not. PG-13. Area theaters. Contains violence and some coarse language. 129 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Theres a sequence halfway through ""Now You See Me 2"" where its four-way team of illusionists put the movies street chases gunfire and action/thriller violence on hold to flip a playing card with a computer chip MacGuffin back and forth in a room full of bad guys invisibly. The card flips floats slithers through the teams clothing crosses their fingers and keeps vanishing from the opposition just before they can spot it. Its clever skulduggery easy to sit back and enjoy and thats essentially what the film pulls off. Its all about mystery and suspense deceiving the audience in entertaining ways. Its much more enjoyable than the typical summer sequel du jour. Think of ""Oceans 12"" and ""13"" with illusions and extended overseas sections for the increasingly crucial international markets. A follow-up to the 2013 franchise setup it cleverly finds new ways to cover old ground. It combines earlier established players (a top-notch crew of Jesse Eisenberg Mark Ruffalo Woody Harrelson Michael Caine Morgan Freeman and more) and themes (using magic and mentalist tricks to frustrate evildoers) while making the repetition stylishly fun to follow. Eisenberg returns as Atlas a key member of the Four Horsemen who are at the same time world famous stage magicians and secretive crime-fighters. Hes the teams snotty bossy John Lennon type. As Merritt ""the mentalist"" Harrelsons hypnotic powers earned most of the laughs in the first film. Here he doubles down as a long-lost relative who resurfaces to upset Merritts applecart. Dave Francos slick sleight-of-hand artist Jack is the ladies candy and Lizzy Caplan pops up as the token woman a part she fills with unexpected good humor. Their mission here is to use hard-to-predict trickery against a tech guru during his big product launch. Its a good demonstration of their abilities; Eisenberg is especially jazzy as he walks through the backstage maze ripping off disguise after disguise. And it builds to a payoff that treats the evildoer like Wile E. Coyote going over the cliff looking down and realizing theres nothing holding him up. Its done quickly and cleverly but its only the first step through a constantly thickening plot toward the surprising end-game climax. With long episodes in Macau and London it builds up a plot that rises up like a house of cards before being knocked over to reveal what we should have expected early. Director Jon M. Chu (""G.I. Joe Retaliation"") working with his own brand of stagecraft provides visual buzz and intense action. Now You See Me 2  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for violence language. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Lionsgate Films photo Now You See Me 2 is a tricky proposition By Calvin Wilson St. Louis Post-Dispatch Calvin Wilson Jun 9 2016 (...) Jay Maidment From left Dave Franco Jesse Eisenberg and Lizzy Caplan in ""Now You See Me 2."" Lionsgate Films photo Its not unusual for a magician to pull a disappearing act but for J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg) Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson) and Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) its a matter of survival. The con artists are on the lam after ripping off insurance magnate Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine) for a ton of money and helping to put magic-debunker Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) in prison.Atlas has grown weary of maintaining a low profile and frustrated with Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) -- an FBI agent whos secretly the mastermind behind the magicians Robin Hood-style exploits but holds his cards close to his chest. Rhodes further alienates Atlas by bringing a new member onto the team the overly enthusiastic Lula (Lizzy Caplan).But she wont have much time to adjust to her new role. The fugitive magicians are about to be confronted by a new foe tech tycoon Walter Mabry (Daniel Radcliffe) who offers them a mission hes made sure theyll be inclined to accept. And if thats not enough for the team to deal with it just so happens that the embittered but highly motivated Bradley has some more tricks up his sleeve. ""Now You See Me 2"" lacks some of the charm of ""Now You See Me"" which proved to be magic at the box office in 2013. The film suffers from the absence of Isla Fisher (who played Lulas predecessor Henley Reeves) and Melanie Laurent (who played an Interpol agent and Rhodes eventual romantic interest). But this fast-moving sequel has its fun moments and is at its best when it just about acknowledges the sheer improbability of the proceedings. Working from a screenplay by Ed Solomon director Jon M. Chu is more craftsman than poet but the charismatic ensemble cast engages in the trickery with style.If nothing else the film will keep fans happy until the release of the already announced ""Now You See Me 3.""

Perhaps best of all the movie captures the first films twisty ability to twirl an audience around so youre never entirely sure whats happened until everything is explained.Jesse Eisenberg in ""Now You See Me 2."" (Photo Jay Maidment)The movie brings back the Four Horsemen a team of underground magicians who perform elaborate heists (dont worry -- theyre essentially modern-day Robin Hoods).

Mabry is played by Daniel Radcliffe and hes a hoot. In Radcliffes hands he is a spoiled and petulant baddie alternately creepy and hilarious.Lizzy Caplan in ""Now You See Me 2."" (Photo Jay Maidment)A sequence in which the Horsemen swipe the chip is a perfect illustration of what works about the movie. The magicians toss the chip which is disguised as a playing card and hide it in their palms behind their backs and under their clothes all evading the eyes of everyone else in the room. Its dazzling and fun and even though its obviously a CGI-enhanced trick you gape as if youre watching real magicians at play. Director Jon M. Chu directed two ""Step Up"" films and his sense of choreography pays off handsomely.ORE AZCENTRAL ON SOCIAL Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | PinterestThe chemistry between returning Horsemen Jesse Eisenberg Dave Franco and Woody Harrelson is unforced and natural and inserts an ""Oceans 11"" charm and swagger to the proceedings. Harrelson scores twice because now hes also playing Chase twin brother of Horseman Merritt. Chase is a snively mentalist with a bad hair transplant and a tan that makes him look like Matthew McConaughey. Lizzy Caplan is added as Lula the newest member of the troupe taking over for Isla Fishers MIA Henley. The delightful Caplan is full of nervous energy; at times she suggests the angsty charms of a young Liza Minnelli. Ruffalo adds gravitas to the proceedings investing Dylan with more shading than youd expect.Sequels often trip themselves up because the element of surprise is gone.

"Now You See Me 2 review The Horsemen still have a few tricks up their sleeve - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Now You See Me 2 review The Horsemen still have a few tricks up their sleeve Trailer Now You See Me 2 Trailer Now You See Me 2 Trailer Now You See Me 2 Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune ""Now You See Me 2"" is more fun than ""Now You See Me"" which says something I guess. It fits snugly in the long list of easygoing nothings the narrative equivalent of a Fruit Roll-Up designed to be forgotten in as many minutes as they took to watch.The cast remains the chief reason it squeaks by but its also a matter of the change in directors. Jon M. Chu did two of the ""Step Up"" movies which I enjoyed for reasons unknown. In the context of this grandiose-deception caper strung together by some absurdly complex and elephantine illusions staged on a large public scale Chus brand of flash and digital trickery is more to my taste than the Roll-Up served up in ""See Me"" 1 by Louis Leterrier. MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOURScripted by Ed Solomon who worked on the first one the sequel opens with the magician-thieves known as the Four Horsemen down one horsewoman (Isla Fisher not present or accounted for). The other three played by Jesse Eisenberg Woody Harrelson and Dave ""Really? Im Co-Starring in a Big Movie?"" Franco are hiding out after their last big swindle waiting for instructions from their contact at the secret organization known as The Eye. So theres an Eye and theres a priceless computer circuit known as ""the stick."" A botched attempt to hijack and expose a dastardly tech visionarys smartphone launch leaves the secret member of the troupe FBI agent Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) ratted out and scrambling for cover. For their next trick the Horsemen are whisked to Macau with their newest member (Lizzy Caplan of ""Masters of Sex"" lightening the load). Theyve been recruited by another tech wizard (Daniel Radcliffe) to steal ""the stick"" which can de-encrypt any and every computer on the planet. But these are principled illusionists our heroes; in their own shady ways they stand for truth justice and a modicum of privacy.Solomon plots ""Now You See Me 2"" by the ton providing 1984 flashbacks for Rhodes (he lost his Houdini-like father in a magic accident) and an identical twin for Harrelsons hypnotist character. Some of this engages; theres refreshingly little heavy violence; a lot of it goes not nowhere exactly but certainly sideways.My main problem with these movies is insufferably old-fashioned. With so much digital effects work guiding so many of the action scenes the simple pleasures of sleight-of-hand are all but lost. (I say this as someone who loved ""Harry in Your Pocket"" at age 12.) The wildest sequence in ""Now You See Me 2"" has the Horsemen smuggling the mini-circuit board hiding on the back of a playing card past some very serious security guards in a Macau research facility. The card changes hands over and over in a series of outlandish flicks handoffs down-the-sleeve maneuvers and physics-defying acrobatics.You dont believe a second of what youre seeing but ... well you dont believe a second of what youre seeing. Yet the design of the sequence is intricately ridiculous and not without panache. Elsewhere Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine are back in action and even with Peter Demings highly variable digital photography the movies Macau and London locales dont hurt. If that sounds like faint-ish praise well check the star rating.

Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman return in roles considerably below their pay grade. And Mark Ruffalo runs himself ragged as the F.B.I. agent whos really working for the Horsemen. Still with me? No worries. There wont be a test. No one could pass it. Director Jon M.

But the movie itself gets away from him piling on one preposterous twist after another until you wish the Horsemen would make you disappear. Its fun to be fooled.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet As a sequel to a movie with a twist ending so over-the-top and improbable that it crossed over into the sublime Now You See Me 2 has no option but to go bigger; if it cant top Now You See Mes reveal which seemed like it came from the mind of Adaptations Donald Kaufman it can at least up the ludicrous quotient double-timing the convoluted plotting and embracing implausibility as an aesthetic. This time around Robin Hood illusionists-turned-international-fugitives J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg) Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson) and Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) are whisked away to Macau alongside new recruit Lula (Lizzy Kaplan) for a nonsensical microchip heist that finds them crossing paths with Merritts evil twin brother (Harrelson in a wig) impersonating South African gangsters and occasionally giving public performances. Like the later Step Up and Fast amp; Furious movies to which it owes so much Now You See Me 2 exists in a world in which all conflicts are resolved the same way except instead of dance-offs or gravity-defying car chases its special-effects-assisted ""illusions"" that the movie doesnt even try to plausibly explain. A little credit is due to director Jon M. Chu--who cut his teeth on Step Up 2 The Streets and Step Up 3D--for at least giving the sleight-of-hand tricks a sense of choreographed motion even if his direction of the chase scenes is completely incoherent. As in his mindboggling live-action Jem And The Holograms the style is all over the place; there are some ineptly staged stunts and indecipherable fights but also streaks of Oceans-esque dazzle like an early hotel tech conference heist that involves hypnosis a gruesome severed hand trick and layers upon layers of tear-away costumes. But if Chu doesnt seem comfortable with the swooping lens-flare-speckled flashiness that director Louis Leterrier brought to the first film he seems even less interested than his predecessor in creating the impression of a recognizably real world--which is a good thing at least for a movie about a superstar heist crew called the Horsemen that involves twins multiple secret identities and a global corporate surveillance plot that can only be foiled through the use of stage magic. Making next to no attempt to explain its over-complicated internal mythology the movie hops back and forth across the globe with no regard for time or space cutting between the Horsemen and FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) as he springs magic-debunking bad guy Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) from minimum-security prison and proceeds to decipher clues with the kind of logic popularly associated with the Adam West Batman series. All of this is being orchestrated by legally dead tech billionaire and amateur magician Walter Mabry (Daniel Radcliffe) or possibly Bradley himself or maybe even the centuries-old secret society of magicians known as the Eye. True to form the movie more or less refuses to explain the actual twist ending; up until then it runs on a regular five-minute schedule of reversals where nothing is ever as it seems. The average film might pull a one-time gag of having a character start speaking say Mandarin halfway through the movie. Now You See Me 2 does it three times. Which raises the question Is anything in the Now You See Me-verse actually real? Or is it twists all the way down? Dropping the first films unlikely explanations of the Horsemens acts (flash powder holograms etc.) in favor of comically evasive partial answers Now You See Me 2 gets giddy on its own unreality. That sense of freewheeling excess extends from the chip heist--set in a metal-free clean room--to the nonstop contrivances and coincidences to the cast. Much the same way as the first film played off Freemans air of authority by making him the dupe Now You See Me 2 gives its returning leads a chance to send up their screen personas with Eisenbergs Atlas made into even more of an egomaniacal dick Harrelson playing the evil twin as even more of a stoner softie and Ruffalo given the role of someone who is only pretending to be a squirrelly determined investigator. Meanwhile the perpetually game Radcliffe tackles his role like a pre-emptive parody of the Bond villain he will probably play in two decades.

EntertainmentMovies Now You See Me 2 No magic in this forgettable sequel Originally published June 9 2016 at 1200 am Updated June 9 2016 at 137 pm Woody Harrelson is part of a crew thats looking to pull One Last Heist in ""Now You See Me 2."" (Jay Maidment) Movie review of ""Now You See Me 2"" The gang -- including Mark Ruffalo Morgan Freeman Michael Caine Jesse Eisenberg Woody Harrelson Dave Franco and Lizzy Caplan -- returns for One Last Heist but will anyone really care? Rating 2 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic The original ""Now You See Me"" in theaters three summers ago made a lot of money but nonetheless vanished like a puff of smoke from the minds of anyone who saw it. Not that it was bad exactly -- no film in which Mark Ruffalo Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine share a screen can be a total waste of time -- but it was the kind of movie that reminded you of a dozen other movies yet never found its own flavor. Now the magician/superhero/con artists/whatever-they-are from the original film known as the Four Horsemen although theres actually at least five of them are back more or less for ""Now You See Me 2."" (Lizzy Caplan subs for Isla Fisher in this edition as apparently there can only be one female horseman at a time.) This time Our Gang -- which also includes Jesse Eisenberg (in yet another variant of his Cranky Guy in a Hoodie persona) Woody Harrelson and Dave Franco -- emerges from hiding to pull off One Last Heist recovering an all-powerful computer chip stolen from reclusive yet charming businessman Walter Mabry (Daniel Radcliffe). Can they do it? Will anyone care? Everything looks glossy and expensive as director Jon M. Chu and screenwriter Ed Solomon whisk the action from New York to Macau to London and the A-list cast does their best to keep things lively. Harrelson has some fun with a double role (who knew Merritt had a rogue twin?) and Radcliffe is as always charming. Speaking of a tech tycoon now his sworn enemy Mabry says ""Owen and I were like the Beatles if the Beatles were ..."" "" ... Elfin?"" someone suggests earning a dirty look. Movie Review    Now You See Me 2 with Jesse Eisenberg Mark Ruffalo Daniel Radcliffe Woody Harrelson Morgan Freeman Lizzy Caplan Dave Franco Jay Chou Sanaa Lathan Michael Caine. Directed by Jon M. Chu from a screenplay by Ed Solomon. 129 minutes. Rated PG-13 for violence and some language. Several theaters. But the basic problem here remains Magic is the language these characters speak and magic just doesnt work on a movie screen -- because its magic already. Weve got no way of knowing whether the sleight-of-hand tricks constantly being performed are for real so its impossible to be impressed by them. And once you take away that language what remains is well ""Oceans 11"" minus half the crew and much of the cleverness. Try to remember this movie a few days after seeing it and youll find that -- like magic -- its disappeared. Most Read StoriesThinking of voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson?

Privacy Policy or Who would have thought that 2013s ""Now You See Me"" an action comedy featuring magicians who use their skills for justice would become a surprise summer hit? But here we are with the sequel ""Now You See Me 2"" with a cast even more star-stuffed than the original with director Jon M. Chu taking the reins from Louis Leterrier.The notorious rogue magicians The Horsemen have been sent underground into hiding after the events of their last trick where they robbed an insurance company for revenge and set up magician Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) to take the fall. Though theyve scattered to the wind secret Horseman and FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) brings the group back together to expose a tech companys plan to sell customer data and violate privacy.The tech company is a red herring in screenwriting parlance or a misdirection as the magicians would say. They arent the real villains of the film. The bad guys are personally connected to The Horsemens last trick and are seeking retribution of their own. The magicians -- Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg) Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson) Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) and newest lady Horseman Lula (Lizzy Caplan) -- are whisked away to Macau where they are pressed into helping a young mysterious scientist/tech guru Walter Mabry (Daniel Radcliffe). Hes seeking a microchip that will let him control markets spy on citizens and essentially rule the world.Because this is a movie about magic there are whiplash-inducing twists and turns in the story where one thing is revealed to be another where illusions are unpacked and explained to the audience -- sometimes. ""Now You See Me 2"" wants to expose the wires and strings behind these tricks but only some of them; the rest you just have to take on faith.""Now You See Me 2"" also wants to make magic cool hip contemporary and used in the service of something greater than just wonder and entertainment. If the performances werent so hokey it might be easier to buy that magicians are actually cool. Lizzy Caplan fulfills the lady quota but her jokester persona is dialed up to hyperactive. Harrelson too is saddled with playing his characters own twin replete with curly wig and blindingly white fake teeth. He seems to be having fun with it but its painfully unfunny.The film written by Ed Solomon and Pete Chiarelli is just too busy too concerned with personal journeys vendettas and conflicts and the message about digital privacy is just a device in the spectacle of plot twists rather than actual cultural commentary. The entire film is about chasing a little thingamabob and then the purpose of the thingamabob is quickly swept aside.The story itself of ""Now You See Me 2"" is one giant magic trick. But theres something disingenuous in following characters their choices and actions for two-plus hours only to find out someone else was pulling the strings. Whats the fun in that?""Now You See Me 2"" delivers as light globe-trotting summer escapism -- an ""Oceans 11"" with sleight of hand. Theres action illusion exotic locations Morgan Freemans voice over. Maybe if the filmmakers had edited down some of their ideas this illusion would feel seamless and breathtaking rather than frenzied and winded.NOW YOU SEE ME 22 stars out of 4Cast Jesse Eisenberg Mark Ruffalo Woody Harrelson Dave Franco Lizzy Caplan Daniel Radcliffe Michael CaineDirected by Jon M.

David Ehrlich Jun 8 2016 613 pm davidehrlich Share This Article Pin It Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Print Talk ""Now You See Me 2"" Courtesy of Lionsgate Legendary magician David Copperfield (who incidentally is a co-producer on ""Now You See Me 2"") used to end his shows by literally flying off the stage -- he would put his hands on his hips puff his chest like Superman and lift up into the rafters. This incredible exit left such an impression because it got to the heart of what magic is all about A great trick doesnt work by blindsiding the audience with an act of God. On the contrary it works by defining the distance between the perceived and the impossible. David Copperfield may have been able to seduce supermodel Claudia Schiffer on his way to amassing a fortune that borders on the billions but the man cant fly. And yet thats what made his finale so grand. It was a spectacular illusion because audiences knew it wasnt real -- as Michael Caine says in ""The Prestige"" ""You want to be fooled."" Magic -- in the mortal sense of the word -- is inherently difficult to sell on screen. The very nature of cinema is predicated upon illusion the eye deceiving the brain into thinking that a rapid-fire stream of still images is in fact a moving picture. From that foundation the tools of the trade render almost nothing impossible as a filmmaker can do as much by cutting between images as a skilled illusionist can by cutting a deck of cards. In other words theres a good reason why there are a lot more movies about actual magic than there are about magicians. In reality its only fun to see a man fly because you dont believe its real; in the movies its only fun if you do. READ MORE Jesse Eisenberg Id Rather Be In A Good Sequel Than A Bad Original - Qamp;A ""Now You See Me 2 begins with some Morgan Freeman narration in which he pledges that ""Seeing is believing."" Although filmmaker John M. Chu has replaced Louis Leterrier in the directors chair its immediately clear that his installment will continue the franchises defining characteristics An open contempt for coherent storytelling and a gleeful failure to understand the idea of ""movie magic."" Picking up a few years after the original left off ""Now You See Me 2"" finds the worlds greatest ragtag team of magicians -- ""The Four Horsemen"" -- being forced to live in hiding. Glorified Robin Hoods for the digital era their ethos of stealing from the rich and giving to the poor has led them afoul of the authorities. Fortunately their leader Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) has a day job as an F.B.I. agent so hes been able to misdirect the feds from the inside. Good thinking ""Now You See Me 2"" All of your favorite Horsemen have returned unless your favorite Horsemen was sole Horsewoman Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher) because shes been swapped out for newcomer Lula May (a plucky Lizzy Caplan) with all the fanfare of a magician dumping his assistant for a younger model; woe to anyone who expects even a half-assed explanation as to where Henley might have disappeared. The rest of the gang is just as you dont remember them Theres Danny Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg) a smug street magician whose steely-eyed scowl always make him look like hes defending himself in divorce court. Then theres Jack Wilder (Dave Franco his comic talents are completely wasted) who can throw playing cards like daggers -- his strong suits have changed completely since the last film. Woody Harrelson returns as hypnotist Merritt McKinney and also as Merritts evil curly-haired twin brother because -- prior to this series -- more Woody Harrelson always seemed like a good idea. Last and definitely least Morgan Freeman is back as the nefarious mean guy who has a convoluted backstory and sometimes does stuff. When the Horsemen step out of the shadows to publicly reveal how a young cell phone magnate is using his latest device to steal his users data our histrionic heroes are upstaged by a mysterious new player. It isnt long before they get to meet him face-to-face as theyre teleported to Macau and brought to his doorstep faster than you can say ""Chinese box office"" (in the films only believable twist it turns out that ""Now You See Me 2"" exists for no other reason than to rake in that sweet sweet yuan). And who is the mystery man responsible for whisking the production halfway around the world? Hes Walter Mabry (Hogwarts alum Daniel Radcliffe delightful in an ironically non-magical role) a spoiled billionaire who wants the Horsemen to steal something because something. Whatever. As per the seriess apparent tradition the plot of this movie has all the coherence and consequence of a presidential caucus and tracing any individual characters arc would likely leave you with a broken wrist. Chus direction elevates this sequel above the original but at least that headache remained focus on the Horsemens economic agenda. By contrast ""Now You See Me 2"" feels like a feature-length film thats entirely comprised of the laziest and most absurd plot holes youve seen in other movies. Its never a good sign when at least a half-dozen story beats are explained by hypnosis. Theres a difference between suspending disbelief and expelling it with extreme prejudice. There are three kinds of magic tricks in ""Now You See Me 2"" Things they dont try to explain things you wish they hadnt tried to explain and things that could only be possible via the wizardry of wretched screenwriting. All of them however rely on the same basic formula Present something so outlandish that it would have to be magic and then suggest that (or agonizingly describe how) it was actually just a work of high-tech god-level deception. In one scene Danny Atlas manipulates every bead of water in a London rainstorm before explaining that the illusion was the result of some strobe lights and a rain machine. Uh huh. Technology may be the new magic but this orgy of unmotivated special effects suggests that just because you can put something on screen doesnt mean that you should. ""Now You See Me 2"" Of course it might be a fun and refreshing change of pace to watch a Hollywood franchise that untethers itself from all intelligent thought by design and the films best sequence hints at the propertys unrealized potential. Jon Chu has always been drawn to dance and the standout moments of his uneven blockbuster career have found him continuing to channel the same grace and fluidity with which he redefined the ""Step Up"" series. Consider the mountain siege in ""G.I. Joe Retaliation"" during which a clan of ninjas repel around a Himalayan temple in a balletic and tightly choreographed routine that marries the cartoonish violence of a Marvel movie with the brute finesse of ""Magic Mike XXL."" READ MORE Lionsgate Plots Now You See Me 3 Says Power Rangers Will Be A Series Of Movies Here he brings that same balletic quality to a sequence in which the Horsemen are tasked with stealing a computer chip from a heavily guarded hermetically sealed vault (in which there are conveniently zero security cameras). Jack pastes the chip onto the face of a playing card and the (CGI-assisted) Horsemen fling it around the room in the hopes of eluding detection. The sequence shouldnt work -- theres nothing at stake and the laws of physics seem to have taken the day off -- but Chu elevates it into a nimble sort of digital dance as you marvel at the inventiveness with which these characters are playing keep-away. At no point are you fooled into thinking that any humans are actually capable of doing this stuff but for at least one scene you can appreciate how cool it would be if they were. We used to watch movies and wonder ""How did they do that?"" The problem with ""Now You See Me 2"" isnt that we already know the answer its that were not even inspired to ask the question.

The plot is convoluted because it was designed to be the big reveal at the end showed that it was just another test. Also most of the magic in the movie was definitely possible. If you havent figured it out by now the water wasnt changed the strobe light focused our attention onto different droplets giving the appearance of floating water. It is painfully obvious from reading this that you would not be cut out for illusion work if you cant pick out details. It was all explained if you were watching closely enough.

Nothing up their sleeves -- or to this empty sequel. Director Jon M. Chu. (209). PG-13 Violence strong language. Area Theaters Good magic is all about misdirection. ""Now You See Me 2"" is all about bad direction. A louder even more confused follow-up to the surprise 2013 hit it throws a lot of stuff at the screen. But little of it sticks and even less makes sense. True things have gotten awkward since the last movie -- in part because original co-star Isla Fisher didnt sign on for this sequel her characters been written out and replaced. The funniest Freaks and Geeks scenes But the rest of the cocky magicians/do-gooders known as the Horsemen -- played by Jesse Eisenberg Dave Franco and Woody Harrelson -- are back. And this time theyve got Lizzy Caplan on their side. Also courtesy of secret boss Mark Ruffalo they also have a new job infiltrate a tech conference and expose a plan to steal and sell the worlds secrets. From l. Dave Franco Lizzy Caplan Jesse Eisenberg) and Woody Harrelson work their magic in Now You See Me 2. (Jay Maidment/Lionsgate) So far so complicated -- like the first film the plotting remains a little vague. But some sequences stand out. Theres one good scene where Eisenbergs Atlas does a quick-change act; another where the four illusionists keep palming and passing a very valuable playing card. But if some moments of magic soar most of the characters quickly crash to earth. Woody Harrelson applies to open medical marijuana dispensary Eisenberg -- still sporting a barely grown-out buzz cut from the end of his lamented stint on ""Batman v Superman"" -- is almost aggressively unlikable. Harrelsons ""hey bro"" McKinney is a smoked ham and Francos Wilder a smirking poser (his entire motivation seems to consist of the mantra be good-looking). And while at least theres some effort to make Caplans spunky Lula more than The Girl the big scene given to Ruffalos Rhodes -- in which he yells about how faceless corporations are stealing our lives -- sounds merely like the great Bernie Sanders speech he never got to give. There are some pretty locations (with the usual eye on the Asian market the studio has set most of the movie in China). And although hes clearly having more fun than we are Harrelson gets to play two parts while the guest-star list includes not only the returning Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman but Daniel Radcliffe too. Harrelson is the wildcard in the sequel to the 2013 thriller. (Jay Maidment/Lionsgate) None of it adds up to much more than smoke and mirrors. Worse the movie even casually strips the first one for parts rejiggering plot elements so wildly the franchise itself no longer makes sense. ""Why didnt you tell me this before"" one shocked character asks another after the person makes a confession completely reversing everything we thought we knew about him. ""I dont know"" he says. Making a successful sequel is always a little bit like pulling a rabbit out of a hat. But the only magic trick here is how slowly theyve made two hours of our lives disappear. Its time to bring down the curtain on this show. Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

The wizardry in 2013s Now You See Me was the kind that typically comes free with a Vegas hotel voucher and the unlimited seafood buffet--a slick silly flimflam all hat and no rabbit. But the movie also made a lot of money and so we have a sequel bigger and louder and--why not?--even more overstuffed with tinsel and tricks than the first one. Improbably Now You See Me 2 is also better aware enough of its abracadabra absurdity that it can actually have some fun with all the nonsense. (If not the title; zero points for creativity marketing Houdinis.) Jesse Eisenberg Woody Harrelson and Dave Franco return as three of the Four Horsemen an itinerant band of magicians commanded by a mysterious unseen overlord and united by a common cause. They may be rebels and scamps but they use their powers for good spell-casting Robin Hoods who steal from the rich and shady so that the poor--or at least the 99 percent-ish--can reap the rewards of their high-tech swindles. Mark Ruffalo is also back as FBI agent Dylan Rhodes a secret supporter of the dark arts whose Keyser Soze reveal provided one of the first films most unintentionally hilarious moments and Morgan Freeman reprises his role as Thaddeus Bradley resident debunker of false magic-turned-Horsemen antagonist. Missing is original Fourth Horsewoman Isla Fisher who spent most of the last movie gamely filling out a sexy-girl-shaped space in the script and looking good in pencil skirts. Shes been replaced by Lizzy Caplan and its one of the sequels biggest improvements. Caplan too has to wear a whole lot of not much but shes also a worthy mouthy foil for her male counterparts. (At one point when Ruffalo gives the crew a rushed lesson in the art of high-speed motorcyle racing she demands to know why hes aiming his instructions specifically at her; it turns out Harrelsons character is the one who cant make it 10 feet on two wheels.) The requisite billionaire baddie here is played by Daniel Radcliffe having a blast in his white suits and velvet loafers and the story catalyst is some very 2016-y fandango about data theft and a universal computer chip. Details are vague and the dialogue is beyond clunky. Characters say things like ""Seeing is believing"" and ""Ill make you suffer"" with straight faces and mean it. Ruffalo is also badly miscast as a mastermind; most of the time he just looks exhausted and confused like a dad who cant remember where he parked at a big-box store. But Jon M. Chu (several Step Up movies) has taken over directing duties from Louis Leterrier and he has a lighter goofier touch. He seems to get that the silliness is baked in. Pay no attention to the plot behind the curtain Now You See Me 2 says because it barely registers and hardly matters. Just go with it and watch two hours--poof--disappear.

Like all self-aggrandizing entities the ""Now You See Me"" franchise (a third film is already in the works) has a lot of nerve. While it is not built on a previously existing comic book with a fan base waiting to be served its good guys are a bunch of narcissistic Las Vegas magicians and its connection to any sort of human reality a thinly stretched piece of Silly String the first installment nevertheless won over audiences -- scoring points with bounce and bravado when the convoluted story unraveled into one impossibility after another. And since that first film concluded with more questions than explanations another chapter was always the rhinoceros waiting to be pulled out of a hat. No worries if you never got around to seeing the first film Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) a character who somehow built a career for himself by debunking magicians -- as though the public actually believed these people were indeed wizards of some sort -- narrates a convenient bare-bones recap of 2013s ""Now You See Me"" in the opening sequence. Depending on your investment level this matters or it doesnt. OK lets just say it doesnt. See Video Now You See Me 2 Trailer Finds Lizzy Caplan Replacing Isla Fisher as Fourth Horseman The Four Horsemen -- a Robin Hood-styled Vegas act made up of hypnotist Merritt (Woody Harrelson) brash street magician Daniel (Jesse Eisenberg) gory fake-out artist Lula (Lizzy Caplan filling a vacancy left by the departure of Isla Fisher) and Jack (Dave Franco) whose main skill seems to involve being superhumanly good at flicking his wrist and throwing playing cards at difficult-to-reach targets -- are in hiding. Having spent the first movie robbing from the evil rich in order to shower their audiences with money a clever trick that both teases a little justice out of the stone-cold world and simultaneously ensures their own acts popularity pretty much forever theyve spent a long time out of the public eye. Now the secret society known as The Eye beckons them to fight another battle. Whats The Eye? Well thats complicated and murky and the less you know going in the better. Just know that a new threat to public safety has reared its head and The Eye doesnt like it. This time its nefarious tech boss Walter Mabry (Daniel Radcliffe whos given the films best throwaway line in which he mentions his own youthful flirtation with magic). Walter wants a powerful chip that he plans to use to control all the worlds computers and he decides to force the 4H team to steal it for him. Working both sides of the legal fence is FBI agent/other Horseman Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) a magicians son with an agenda of his own. Meanwhile Thaddeus slinks around the margins waiting to blow your mind. Also Read Now You See Me 2 Director Jon M Chu in Talks to Helm Crazy Rich Asians It would be an act of bad faith to give away too many details from a movie about crime-fighting magicians but much like the first film the trickery of ""Now You See Me 2"" involves thoroughly preposterous levels of technical precision feats of transformation and transportation over great distances at immense expense surprise reveals hitch-free stunts doppelgangers unseen assistants and faked identities all bolstered by the kind of wild good luck and staggering synchronization found only in movies. Director Jon M. Chu has a lighter touch than ""Now You See Me"" director Louis Leterrier. The latters ""Transporter"" pedigree made sure there was plenty of rugged action but Chus resume boasts ""Jem and the Holograms"" ""G.I. Joe Retaliation"" and more than one film in the ""Step Up"" franchise. The man knows his cartoons and thats a good thing. To keep the entire enterprise from floating away cinematographer Peter Deming (""Mulholland Drive"" the upcoming ""Twin Peaks"" revival) positions most of the onscreen bodies in as much detailed darkness as possible the better to minimize the utter ridiculousness of their actions. Ed Solomon returns to screenwriting duties and his Horsemen originally coming off as a pack of self-serving careerists are looking more and more like a less-powerful Avengers the bickering turned up the oppressive egos and posturing turned down. The cast follows this lead and Caplan in particular provides a fresh infusion of smart-ass energy into the boys club. Also Read CinemaCon 2016 Scare Now You See Me 2 Screening Cut Short for Security Concerns The superhero parallels keep coming and thats clearly intentional. The film is aware of its place in a cinematic landscape that prefers its crime fighters to have at least some sort of enhanced personal ability. But ""Now You See Me 2"" knows its heroes cant save the world and more importantly it knows that saving the world keeps getting done to death in other movies and that no one in the audience expects anything less. So the film positions itself as a fantasy of minor more personal justice. Global tech surveillance and privacy invasion the financial sectors rigged economy corporate dominance over ordinary lives these are the enemies not comic-book aliens from space and for the films duration people in street clothes are fighting back and winning. And then they hang out and explain how they did it -- which is weird and no actual magician would ever do it but its a movie so they kind of have to. For their next trick they make a next trick sound like an attractive prospect.

TWITTER 6/10/2016 Daniel Radcliffe and Lizzy Caplan join the magic-caper franchiseas ensemble cast in this sequel. Sleight-of-hand is the name of the game in Now You See Me 2 -- not just for the renegade magician characters but for the filmmakers. No less than in the glossy capers 2013 predecessor the plot rides a surging tide of ridiculousness and culminates in a pileup of unconvincing explanations. As practitioners of prestidigitation take on the wielders of malevolent corporate power anyone tempted to give the storys ostentatious twists much thought should understand the likelihood of headache. By the time the storys final revelation has been pulled out of the hat the only thing thats certain is the eventual materialization of Now You See Me 3. But if this chapter is ultimately more convoluted than spellbinding it offers sequences of crackerjack illusion as you might expect from a project where David Copperfield serves as co-producer. Like the feature that kicked off the unlikely franchise the new film should have no trouble razzle-dazzling a healthy share of popcorn dollars. With Jon M. Chu at the helm the movie reconvenes most of the cast from the first go-round the key additions being Daniel Radcliffe and Lizzy Caplan. The latter essentially taking the place of the departed Isla Fisher joins Jesse Eisenberg Woody Harrelson and Dave Franco in the Four Horsemen -- a hotshot Vegas act whose elaborate magic routines expose and bilk corporate scoundrels. For Caplans role as Lula Ed Solomons busy screenplay takes a few well-placed jabs at the idea of the token female cohort and the actress puts those digs across with just the right spunk. But this is a movie populated by glib character types rather than fully fleshed-out people. Thats true even for the storys intended emotional engine Mark Ruffalos Dylan Rhodes a soulful-eyed composite of traumatic backstory and drive for justice. The Horsemens boss Dylan has put the troupe on hold for a year since enacting revenge against magic debunker Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman). Dylans cover as an FBI agent is unraveling under the scrutiny of two colleagues (Sanaa Lathan David Warshofsky) just as the Four Horsemen come out of hiding to hijack a high-tech companys product launch and expose the CEOs privacy-threatening schemes. The quartet is in turn hijacked in flamboyant fashion. That leads them to Macau where the movie gets a shot of cartoonish zest from a bearded Radcliffes super-rich baddie and his quest to recapture a super-duper computer chip. As MacGuffins go that chip is exceptionally absurd. But its also at the center of an exceptionally diverting set piece in which Chu and DP Peter Deming niftily parse an extended bit of cardistry by the Horsemen showing us each step of the trick without losing the sense of artfulness or the suspense of the situation. Chu whose directing credits include a couple of Step Up features Justin Bieber docs and G.I. Joe Retaliation sells the sequences pizazz without pushing it too hard. The same is true of an early scene where Eisenbergs character moves seamlessly through a string of aliases while infiltrating a public event. Elsewhere Chu keeps things moving at a smooth pace that wisely discourages contemplation abetted by the straightforward sheen of Demings widescreen lensing. The production design by Sharon Seymour is a fluid counterpart to the plots uneasy mix of magic and heightened reality a lyrical New York subway tunnel the bright bustle of an open-air market in Macau and the in-between of an ancient magic shop (based on an actual store) thats run by a young man (Jay Chou) and his grandmother (Tsai Chin) and proves unsurprisingly crucial to the action. Compared with the first film this one embraces the premises essential preposterousness although not necessarily to winning effect. Case in point is the unwelcome arrival on the scene of Harrelsons characters evil twin. Its a setup thats as hard to take for the audience as it is for Harrelsons character. But at least it takes a chance compared with the predictable turns by Freeman and Michael Caine (as a nefarious insurance magnate) doing what they do. All aspects of the movie including Brian Tylers otherwise overstated score click when the Horsemen are doing their magic. Its then that the characters get to drop the snarky goading and shticky putdowns that sub for personality and the actors persuasively show how the magicians come alive in performance. Despite the so-what of the story surrounding them those scenes build a certain level of anticipation for the expected piece de resistance that will cap the feature. It turns out to be as much about moviemaking as about anything in the story. And like the tortuous plot with its shifting line between heroes and villains whether that final illusion is worth all the work is another matter.

""Now You See Me 2"" is the kind of sequel that has all but gone out of fashion a follow-up to a blockbuster so flaky and off-center that even those who made the original probably never expected it to spawn a second chapter. The new film is an even wilder lark--a madly spinning top of a movie powered by an eagerness to please that somehow comes off as more innocent than calculated. The film knows that its playing you and in almost every scene invites the audience to embrace the fact that its being played. It now feels downright retro and maybe even a little exotic -- in a good way -- to encounter a sequel that isnt all about setting up a five-year plan of franchise plot points. ""Now You See Me 2"" is more like a giddy piece of cheese from the 80s a chance to spend two more hours with characters we like doing variations on the things that made us like them in the first place. The revisit in this case is well-earned and fans of the original -- as well as new converts -- are likely to turn out in droves. Three years ago the first ""Now You See Me"" was an irresistible fluffier-than-air concoction -- a grand-illusion thriller drawing on elements from Christopher Nolans ""The Prestige"" and Steven Soderberghs ""Oceans"" series that kept yanking the rug out from under the audience and each time that happened it gave you a cheaply satisfying rush. With its nattering ultra-competitive band of rogue magician heroes and a plot so elaborate it was like a Rubiks Cube nestled inside a set of Russian dolls the movie was exuberantly clever and also borderline preposterous. The way the intricacy kept shading off into absurdity was all part of its diabolical corny charm. In ""Now You See Me 2"" the infamous tricksters known as the Four Horsemen are back toying with our heads in even more delirious -- and ridiculous -- ways. Woody Harrelsons Merritt McKinney the hypnotist in a pork-pie hat reduces his targets to a putty-like trance with even more smirky panache than before and Dave Francos sleight-of-hand artist Jack Wilder flips a deck of cards around like the Paganini of street showmanship. Jesse Eisenberg as group leader J. Daniel Atlas exudes a newly understated confidence that looks good on him and that comes as a relief after the genius-geek jibber-jabber of his slipshod demonic performance in ""Batman v Superman."" Isla Fisher who is not rejoining the party has been replaced by the ingratiatingly antic Lizzy Caplan as Lula who gets right onto the films wavelength of gaga showmanship in a scene where having snuck into Daniels apartment she fakes her own death by guillotine (a startling visual effect) and just keeps on talking. That lets you know that shes in the right place. The Horseman are a team deeply loyal to each other but theyre also rivals who interact in a dizzy flurry of one-upmanship. Early on theyre doing a stage show that involves hypnotizing the CEO of a tech company and getting him to reveal the fascist truth about himself but just when it looks like the scheme is working the tables get turned. Theyre forced to flee the stage leaping from a rooftop down into a giant tube where they slide for about 30 seconds until they pop out the other side...in China. It says something about the way ""Now You See Me 2"" manipulates the power of suggestion that we actually think for a moment ""Could that really have happened?"" At the same time were avid to know how it did happen and the movie keeps our curiosity suspended juggling its mysteries like balls in the air. Our heroes it turns out have landed in Macau where theyve been recruited by Walter Mabry (Daniel Radcliffe) a smug mastermind whos been hiding off the grid. He orders them to perform a do-or-die mission They must steal a circuit known as ""the stick"" which has the power to de-encrypt any computer program on earth. ""Steal something"" whines Merritt ""for this narcissistic little man-boy?"" The line is a compliment to Radcliffes performance. All bearded creepy grins he makes Walter a megalomaniac imp like the worlds youngest Bond villain. The sequence in which the Horsemen talk their way into a heavily guarded vault to steal the stick is a stupendously staged piece of dream-time deception. The films director is Jon M. Chu (taking over for Louis Leterrier) who made the surprisingly hypnotic second and third ""Step Up"" dance films and he treats this heist like a piece of pure choreography with the stick embedded in an ace of spades that gets flipped and cupped and tossed from one Horseman to another. Can we believe what were watching? Of course not But the beauty of it is that you still do. The pleasure of ""Now You See Me 2"" is that the Horsemen perform magic with literal human powers. Theyre superheroes of the mind. Of course the movie cheats right and left to let them do that so we cant take their virtuosity of illusion too seriously. Yet its fun to pretend that they -- or anyone -- could wield that level of mastery. The movie folds a joker into its deck by casting Harrelson in a second role as Merritts evil twin brother who sports gleaming teeth and a delivery that makes him sound a bit like Sammy Davis Jr. (Hes funny...sort of. For a while.) It also attempts to expand the gamesmanship into an emotional experience by deepening the character of Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) the FBI agent whos chasing the Horsemen down but is actually their secret confidante/mole/honorary ringleader. The script by Ed Solomon provides him with a backstory -- as a boy in 1984 he watched his magician daddy drown in a trunk like a failed Houdini. And though its a bit of a cliche Ruffalo with his addled sincerity makes it work. What works less well is Dylans vendetta against Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) the magic debunker he blames for his fathers death. He breaks Thaddeus out of prison all to take revenge on him and this leads to a series of whos-zooming-who convolutions that must have looked perfect on paper but that play in the movie a little abstractly even as Freeman lends his scenes a majestic twinkle. Glitteringly shot by Peter Deming and edited by Stan Salfas with impressive rapid-fire precision ""Now You See Me 2"" is a roller-coaster of teases fake-outs contrivances and jaw-drops. The film counts on our desire to see the Horsemen stage one more global broadcast of show-stopping illusion only to strand them as prisoners aboard a private plane. We keep thinking When is the climax going to arrive? And the joke of course is on us. In ""Now You See Me 2"" there is always more than meets the eye maybe because the film itself never stops winking. Film Review Now You See Me 2Reviewed at Magno 2 New York May 27 2016.

Keith says July 19 2016 at 1233 am Worst movie I have seen in years. Eisenberg is just the worst actor on earth. I have a pet dog that can deliver a bark better and looks better. Plot is nonsense and what was woody harelson doing  He kooks like he is embarrassed to be there and have to say so were most of the movie goers. If you want a successful movie firstly never cast that uselsss plonker Eisenberg Reply juan mendez says July 10 2016 at 748 am Although it got mixed critical reviews I really enjoyed the first Now You See Me film in 2013. It had a decent plot with a twist that I dont mind admitting I didnt see coming Reply Sree says June 29 2016 at 1241 pm I actually loved the movie If you loved the 1st movie you will love the 2nd one Reply Angelina Glomb says June 11 2016 at 514 pm I liked the movie and I really enjoyed reading this review. Ill read more reviews from Owen Gleiberman because he seems more human to me. Not a snob. The tricks were marvelous and Owen described my enjoyment to a tee. Thanks Reply LotusGeek says June 7 2016 at 953 am Do they explain what the hell the Eye actually is? Reply Yootha says June 1 2016 at 830 am Oh just get Eisenberg off the screen for good. Hes a hammy actor amp; visually offensive. Reply Angelina Glomb says June 11 2016 at 516 pm Jessie Eisenberg is one of my favorites but then - Im female maybe thats it. Reply kevinizon says June 3 2016 at 1255 pm that is hilarious. thanks. Reply John says June 1 2016 at 1223 pm Sadly I have to agree. Somehow Jesse Eisenberg tends to rub people the wrong way especially male audience. Currently he holds the title as the most annoying actor. Reply Natty Bumppo says June 1 2016 at 520 am I remember the days when Variety reviewers would piss all over a film like this. Aah memories. Reply Jimmy Dell says July 7 2016 at 702 am Yes I remember those days as well and I will attempt to revive them here. Movies being a visual art shouldnt need a ream of dialog at the end to explain what you have just watched. If a story is told well an explanation should be unnecessary. Also I second all of the comments regarding Jesse Eisenbergs annoying screen presence. Reply Jedi77 says June 1 2016 at 556 am Really when was that? Reply stevenkovacs says June 1 2016 at 222 am He liked it He really really liked it Reply Mr Model says June 1 2016 at 406 am I said ""poof"" ~ Im gone. Youre not supposed to see me anymore.....
