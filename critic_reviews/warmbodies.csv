"Warm Bodies review Lukewarm comedy | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesWarm Bodies review Lukewarm comedyNicholas Hoults zombie R plays out well on-screen but is let down by a weak premise.Teresa Palmer and Nicholas Hoult achieve chemistry despite Hoults inability to speak in sentences.  (Jan Thijs / eOne)  By Tim AlamenciakNews reporterThu. Jan. 31 2013Warm BodiesStarring Nicholas Hoult Teresa Palmer and Rob Corddry. Directed by Jonathan Levine. 98 minutes. Opens Feb. 1 at major theatres. PGInterspecies romance is never an easy sell. As hard as the actors in Warm Bodies try theyre let down by a premise that stretches things too far.Nicholas Hoult (X-Men First Class) plays R a 20-something zombie with no recollection of his past beyond the first letter of his name. While his character can groan and mutter a few words throughout most of Rs dialogue is in the form of a voiceover.Article Continued BelowRugged rebellious Julie (Teresa Palmer) is out gathering supplies with her boyfriend Perry (Dave Franco) and a party of assorted human survivors when disaster strikes. They run into R and his zombie friend M (The Daily Shows Rob Corddry) who are out hunting for lunch -- fresh brains of course.A fight ensues as the fast-moving zombies quickly overpower the small human party.But its not all tragedy. In the world of Warm Bodies zombies can briefly experience the memories of a human by eating their brains. This is the gruesome complicating action that sparks the whole romance -- R chews on Perrys brain and looks over at his girlfriend Julie. Something in his dead heart awakens and he falls in love.Smearing her with his zombie blood to mask her scent from the others R smuggles Julie back to the airport where hundreds of undead have gathered to live. Based on Isaac Marions novel of the same name the story lacks the intensity of a typical zombie movie. Theres no virus or supernatural source to explain the scourge of undead. Thats part of the problem -- its not gruesome enough to please genre fans but not nearly funny enough to be a comedy either. It tries to be a mixture of both and fails.At the hideout the gradually more human R has an apartment made from an old airplane stuffed with trinkets and records he swipes from town. Hoult does a good job of portraying R as a cool 20-something -- who just happens to be dead -- struggling to connect with a girl.The two stars have great chemistry on-screen despite Hoult being limited by playing an emotionless unexpressive zombie. Aged zombies are called ""bonies"" -- unremarkable CGI skeletons that are completely devoid of humanity. One might call them the full zombies while the ones with remnants of personality are mere half-zombies.R and Julies romance makes R more human which somehow spreads to his friend M and the rest of the zombies. The bonies catch wind of this and turn on them forcing them to flee the airport.The allusions to Romeo and Juliet bludgeon the watcher throughout. Hoults zombie is a classic Romeo down to his initial and Julie whose name is one letter away from Juliet has a father (John Malkovich) who hates zombies. Theres even a requisite balcony scene.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Comments click to enlarge Warm Bodies Video Rated PG-13  98 minutes  2013 Director Jonathan Levine hit the jackpot with Will Reisers screenplay for 50/50 (2011) a funny and true account of a young man facing death by cancer. For this follow-up effort Levine has adapted a ""zombie romance"" novel by Isaac Marion about the star-crossed love between a zombie boy and a live girl which might seem similar in theme to 50/50 but registers on-screen as a muddled teenpic. Nicholas Hoult is the cute zombie in a red hoodie Teresa Palmer is the girl he wins over after killing her boyfriend (a conflict never satisfactorily resolved) and John Malkovich is her father one of those post-apocalyptic warrior types who disapproves of his daughter going with a boy who eats brains.

I havent enjoyed a film as much for a long time. Yes the review is right as its plays fast and loose with the horror genre but the comic timing is right on the button and the music choices are superb. Very possibly an ""American Werewolf in London"" for this generation. A good four star film and a film that will be shown in last night screenings in years to come. Apart from Flight probably the best film I have seen this year.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/london/film/warm-bodies,200,warmbodies3,warmbodies,timeout

It does start off with some stabs at comedy as R (a suitably puppy-dog-ish Nicholas Hoult) a young zombie wandering through life (or I guess death) ruminates in nauseatingly ironic voice-over ""What am I doing with my life? ... Why cant I connect with people? Oh right cause Im dead."" Thats about as witty as the movie gets. For all of Rs allegedly humorous observations about the wasteland of the undead through which he walks they feel tacked on -- like somebody decided to turn this thing into a comedy at the last second. R calls himself that because he cant remember what his name used to be before the zombie apocalypse. He just remembers that it started with an R. Of course we dont need him to tell us his name; as soon as he meets Julie (a likable Teresa Palmer) one of a small gaggle of surviving human resistors we realize it stands for Romeo. Julies father played by a surprisingly earnest John Malkovich is the leader of the resistance and shes a little conflicted about that the same way R is conflicted about eating humans. Then R and his fellow zombies among them his best friend M (Rob Corddry wasted) ambush the young woman and her compatriots. R eats Julies boyfriends brain -- which results in him acquiring the now-dead young mans memories as well as a love for the young woman. This could have been interesting and for a brief moment it is. A flashback to the dead boyfriends childhood memories as R experiences them is rather poignant -- but the film drops this idea of one man inheriting another mans emotional life and instead just settles for the zombie Romeo and Juliet thing wherein R protects Julie from his fellow undead and later she returns the favor. The action is surprisingly earnest -- the film blows most of its ""jokes"" in its opening act -- and it all builds to the usual business about the transformative nature of love done in as halfhearted a way as possible. Actually a truly zombie Romeo and Juliet might have been interesting as well but writer-director Jonathan Levine (The Wackness 50/50) working off Isaac Marions novel doesnt go there. These zombies arent really zombies apparently; like R they still possess some human traits. They dont even get to be the villains here Thats reserved for the ""boneys"" superfast skeleton-like creatures that the zombies will eventually turn into. Therefore R is basically a person-in-training He just cant speak as well or walk as well and he sometimes likes brains. That maybe makes him easier to love but its also an easy out -- kind of a fatal one because it makes the romance not one of opposites but of a human and an almost-human. That might have worked on some kind of symbolic level but the film doesnt have the vision to pull such a thing off. It wants to be an anthemic ode to young love but it lacks the danger of Shakespeares Romeo and Juliet. Or hell Baz Luhrmanns Romeo + Juliet. Over and over Warm Bodies avoids anything that feels like a challenge and settles for the generic. And it doesnt do generic well either. We get some gags early on about how life as a zombie isnt all that different from life as a human as R wonders ""It must have been so much better before when everybody could communicate and express their feelings."" The film then cuts to a flashback to the pre-zombie apocalypse -- when everybody was you guessed it checking their phones. None of this is anything that Edgar Wrights Shaun of the Dead (which seems to get more brilliant by the hour) didnt do far more effectively and entertainingly in its first two minutes. But Warm Bodies doesnt even have the conviction to follow through on its lame ideas let alone its good ones. Its a mostly terrible film that misses the opportunity to be a merely mediocre one.

Like Shaun of the Dead it was a dark zombie romcom but it definitely had its own distinct tone and had great acting all around. One area where it even exceeded Shaun of the Dead was in music - one of my favorite examples was when they used M83s ""Midnight City"" during the great scene where R is ""made up"" to look like a human. Monicasaid on Saturday February 23 2013 122314 PMHaywire is not worth the tedium neesscary to find any morsel of poorly supported action ; really the beef in this? burger is pink slime. (If shes not saved by a geeky bystander in the first action scene  there wouldnt be any movie. It goes on from there to become horrifically tedious. They drive around a lot. Low budget perhaps. Whatever. Waste of time and money.) Juliesaid on Thursday February 21 2013 45413 PMLoved the book and the movie delivered. It was subtle and well acted great music and good dialogue. Jimsaid on Sunday February 17 2013 123201 AMYou gave Shaun of the Dead thumbs down but this a big A- ? lol. The film has a little charm but I dont see how a lot of it is well executed and I never really laughed. So far Warm Bodies is the most over-rated film of 2013.

The vampire Edward eschewed chewing on Bella throughout the Twilight saga. Now as a zombie who goes by the name of R in the zomb-rom-com Warm Bodies Nicholas Hoult graciously forswears chomping on Julie (Teresa Palmer) a pretty gal just trying to get by in a post-apocalyptic world. Which considering that an undead fellow has got to eat is pretty gentlemanly. Warm Bodies is a funnier and pleasantly cheaper-grade movie than Twilight that aims to draw in both Bella amp; Edward lovers and haters. The films gooey romantic center concerns pretty Rs efforts to prove to pretty Julie that hes got a particularly temperate heart for a walker and Julies slow transformation from distrustful zombie-hunter to compassionate girlfriend. (The movie written and directed with a light touch of mess by Jonathan Levine is born of an online short story by Isaac Marion that became a novel and won the admiration of Twilight creator Stephenie Meyer.) Its the odd splatters of comedic business that make the time pass tolerably enough and for that four performances deserve a shout-out X-Men ex-man Hoult does fun stuff conveying the frustration of a zombie who is kind of bored out of his skull with the whole shuffling and grunting thing; Rob Corddry makes an entertaining zombie buddy in exasperation; Crazy Stupid Loves Analeigh Tipton -- one of my one very favorite secret-weapon sylphs these days -- makes every line fresh as Julies best friend; and then theres John Malkovich. The old pro plays the leader of all who are still human on earth an overlord who happens to be Julies father. At this point in the actors career it is pretty well impossible to tell when Malkovich is camping it up or just being John Malkovich. Under the end-of-civilization circumstances of Warm Bodies hes just the right guy for the job.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Theres a problem. By that I mean how can Hollywood make zombies the new vampires? A vamp can be dark mysterious and romantic (see Twilight). A lurching hollow-eyed zombie walks around with oozing pustules and rotting flesh (see The Walking Dead). Who wants to hit on that? Warm Bodies solves that problem. Or at least it tries. Nicholas Hoult the lead zombie is an extremely appealing actor. Check out Netflix to watch him grow from child (About a Boy) to adult (A Single Man X-Men First Class). Anyway Hoult is charm personified as R (a living-dead hottie who cant remember the rest of his name). R communicates in grunts with his fellow zombies including M (Rob Corddry very good). But writer-director Jonathan Levine (50/50) wisely borrows from Isaac Marions noveland has R narrate the action in the voice of a clued-in teen with a wiseass sense of humor. R and his dead buddies hang at an airport where R uses an abandoned jet to horde souvenirs and a record collection that includes Springsteens ""Hungry Heart."" R likes his music analog (""it sounds more alive""). On a raid the zombies attack some human teens. R chows down on the brains of a dude named Perry (Dave Franco) and absorbs his memories. Say what? Look I never promised logic. This draws R to Julie (Teresa Palmer) Perrys girlfriend. Julie is also the daughter of Gen. Grigio (John Malkovich in paycheck mode) leader of the survivors. Julies a rebel. She doesnt waste time grieving for Perry. In short order shes cozying up to R in his airplane and letting him teach her how to walk dead to stay alive. Of course they fall hard. R doesn1t even want to eat her brains. Thats love. Its the romantic angle that will probably give Warm Bodies box-office ju-ju from Super Bowl weekend to Valentines Day. You could do worse. There1s a good deal of fun before the movie sells its cheeky soul to the gods of tween goo. It doesnt help that the Bonies computer-generated zombie skeletons cant generate a decent scare. The script is too primly PG-13 to really go for it. Warm Bodies even suggests that true love can help the right zombie grow a new heart. That1s a con job that makes Bodies lukewarm at best.

Franco Zeffirellis 1968 film (itself following in the footsteps of more than a dozen cinematic predecessors) upped the ante with a controversial bit of nudity; a 1996 variant Tromeo and Juliet went all in with a giant mutant penis. For the arithmetically inclined there have been both a Romeo + Juliet and a Romeo x Juliet. (Given the plot its odd that no one has yet resorted to subtraction or division signs.) The Bards story has been told by way of feuding pizzeria owners in Verona New Jersey and across the river feuding caterers in the Bronx. There have famously been Sharks and Jets and less famously cold warriors robots seals pornographers and garden gnomes. A few years back the Royal Shakespeare Company actually tweeted the tale under the all too apt title Such Tweet Sorrow. If there were one play in the English language youd imagine was fully played out by now this would be it--but no here comes Julian Fellowes taking time off Downton to pen his own adaptation due out later this year. Related Story Our Zombies Ourselves How to make it all fresh again? Heres a thought Have Juliet and Romeo meet cute when she stabs him in the heart with a knife after hes just killed and eaten her boyfriend. Stick with me here you see this time out shes a human being and hes a zombie. Not a glamorous vampire fangs glinting priapically. No an honest to goodness animated corpse complete with all the shambling and grunting and (occasional) brain-eating. This is hardly the most promising premise for a romantic comedy but damned if Warm Bodies--directed by Jonathan Levine and adapted from the novel by Isaac Marion--doesnt somehow bring it to life. Nicholas Hoult stars as ""R"" the remaining letters of his name having been lost in the psychic fog of zombiedom. He and his ashen masses of fellow undead (notable among them Rob Corddrys ""M""--no relation to the spymaster) make their home at the airport as if waiting for a flight delayed indefinitely. Blonde pinkly alive Julie (Teresa Palmer) meanwhile lives in a high-walled urban fortress with the remaining human survivors of an undisclosed apocalypse. When she and a team venture outside the wall in search of medical supplies they encounter R and his own posse out looking for a bite--and whoosh tucked in there amid the automatic-weapon fire and arterial spray Cupids arrow strikes. Her human companions dead Julie returns with R to the airport where he has a jetliner all to himself like some cadaverous Ron Burkle. He plays her some LPs she teaches him to drive and pump by tentative pump--oh get your mind out of the gutter its PG-13--his heart slowly begins to beat again.There are hurdles to overcome of course Julies disapproving father (John Malkovich phoning it in a bit) Rs habit of nibbling leftover bits of her boyfriends brain the violent attentions of a more degenerate species of skeletal zombie and so on. But despite all these--and with the aid of an inevitable balcony scene--R eventually wins Julies love. Though his mind is nimble out loud R can only express himself in a series of groans and grumbles--as touching a metaphor for love-struck adolescence as we may see at the movies this year. And why shouldnt he? Hoult who was a chubby-cheeked cherub in About a Boy and a seductive seraph in A Single Man sets a new bar for post-mortem adorability as R. Though his mind is nimble in (very witty) voiceover out loud he can only express himself in a series of groans and grumbles--as touching a metaphor for love-struck adolescence as we may see at the movies this year. ""Stop staring"" his internal monologue warns him at one point. ""Youre acting weird again."" Julie can see it too ""It must be hard being stuck in there."" (Speaking from experience Yes it was.) Palmer is an eminently likable presence--a bit like a less-pouty Kristen Stewart if such a thing can be imagined--and Corddry demonstrates that no one delivers deadpan better than the undead. Jonathan Levine (The Wackness 50/50) continues his strong run with direction that is deft funny and (given the subject matter) surprisingly tender. The soundtrack is a particular kick making crafty use of songs ranging from ""Sitting Here in Limbo"" to ""Missing You"" to ""Pretty Woman.""Is the premise of Warm Bodies a touch creepy? Yes it is and it is probably safest not to subject the movie to much scrutiny moral or physiological. But in contrast to the generic rom-com fluff were typically offered in the run-up to Valentines Day this is a movie with a genuine heartbeat.

Continue Reading Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics. Continue Reading Gary Cameron / Reuters Trump Time Capsule 62 A Man Who Can Be Baited With a Tweet James Fallows None Last night in her overall very successful acceptance speech Hillary Clinton said with ruthless precision about her opponent Ask yourself Does Donald Trump have the temperament to be Commander-in-Chief? Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading daily sunny/Flickr What an Introvert Sounds Like Olga Khazan The World Well-Being Project uses Facebook updates to correlate language with personality traits. Do our Facebook posts reflect our true personalities? Incrementally probably not. But in aggregate the things we say on social media paint a fairly accurate portrait of our inner selves. A team of University of Pennsylvania scientists is using Facebook status updates to find commonalities in the words used by different ages genders and even psyches. The so-called ""World Well-Being Project"" started as an effort to gauge happiness across various states and communities. ""Governments have an increased interest in measuring not just economic outcomes but other aspects of well-being"" said Andrew Schwartz a UPenn computer scientist who works on the project. ""But its very difficult to study well-being at a large scale. It costs a lot of money to administer surveys to see how people are doing in certain areas. Social media can help with that.""

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

Graham A federal appeals court finds the impact of the states voting law can only be explained by ""discriminatory intent."" Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz.

Of course thats true of about 90 percent of Hollywood movies and lets pause for a second to reflect that the original concept here involves a retelling of ""Romeo and Juliet"" with zombies. So to say that the movie is not quite as good as its mind-blowingly moronic premise is not praise. At any rate ""Warm Bodies"" is more a mild-mannered emo-flavored romcom than a zombie movie. It has some tepid action scenes a few swatches of genuine humor and a general spirit of cheerfulness especially considering it depicts a future in which civilization has been destroyed. Thats more than enough to make it a hit in the dreary depths of February and early reviews suggest that weve all agreed to overlook the fact that its essentially lazy and stupid hackwork that makes the ""Twilight"" movies look like a collaboration between David Lynch and Robert Bresson.I realize that Im being a sourpuss about a lightweight PG-13 fantasy that has committed no crimes against humanity and exists solely to give teenagers something to do on a midwinter weekend. Whats got me so pissed off is the sense that writer-director Jonathan Levine (adapting a Stephenie Meyer-endorsed bestseller by Isaac Marion) looks down on the material and fundamentally disrespects his audience. Levine is a youngish ambitious and faintly hip filmmaker who has directed better movies than this (""50/50"" and ""The Wackness"") and I hope to Christ wont go on to make a worse one.""Warm Bodies"" completely fails to take either its zombie-apocalypse story or its love story seriously and just skates by on its good-looking stars a handful of laughs and an eclectic pop soundtrack virtually all of it recorded before the movies target audience was born. (Some of it like Bob Dylans ""Shelter From the Storm"" and Roy Orbisons ""Oh Pretty Woman"" probably predates their parents.) I totally understand that for many viewers that will be enough; maybe its hopelessly nerdy to insist that a movie that people spent millions of dollars to make should hang together somewhat better than a ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch from 1993.So what weve got here is a youngish still cute-ish zombie who cant remember his name but well come to know as R (played by British actor Nicholas Hoult recently seen in ""X-Men First Class"" and ""Clash of the Titans""). Despite a blue-gray pallor and some distended veins on his neck R doesnt look much worse than your typical suburban rec-room vidgame-playing Goth. And although he spends his days shuffling around the airport among a horde of other zombies -- and occasionally going on expeditions in search of human brains -- he retains his inner soulfulness and rather sweet sense of self. How do we know that? He tells us so in endless streams of mildly self-mocking voiceover narration just like the protagonist of every other mid-budget pseudo-indie film about a misunderstood teenager.For one thing this puts the cart before the horse in narrative terms. Its no surprise when R decides to rescue a blonde human chick named Julie (Aussie actress Teresa Palmer) from being devoured by his pals and takes her back to his boy-cave aboard an abandoned plane to play her Joni Mitchell LPs. (You think Im kidding right?) Because we already know hes basically nice beneath the undeadness. But then again if R is so decent and anguished and clinging to remnants of humanity and all how come he just killed Rs boyfriend and ate his brain? You Might Also Like I havent read the original novel but throughout this adaptation Levine tries to have it both ways R is already a good guy who has never surrendered to pernicious zombie culture and he is transformed by the psilocybin-like effects of eating Julies boyfriends brain and inheriting his consciousness and falling in love with her by proxy. Or something. I guess in this universe being a zombie is like the way right-wing Christians view being gay Its a lifestyle choice Recovery is possible All this young man needs is the right girlTo extend the metaphor just a little further into territory thats really going to get me in trouble zombie culture in ""Warm Bodies"" has a stratified caste system that includes a hardcore leather-boy subculture of those who have gone way over to the dark side and cannot be redeemed to heterosexuality ... sorry sorry I mean humanity. These are the ""bonies"" zombies who have stripped off all their flesh (kinky) and become skeletons. Skeletons with superpowers apparently -- these include the power to see without eyeballs vocalize without tongues or lips and run really fast. (Regular zombies as we all know stagger around like ... well like -- theres no other word for it is there?)R mutters something early on about how the bonies are just zombies who have ""given up all hope"" and I guess all memory of the humanity they once possessed. But the biology or theology or whatever you want to call it of ""Warm Bodies"" remains entirely vague which creates insoluble narrative problems the whole way through the movie but especially towards the end -- highly unspecific spoiler alert -- when other zombies become infected by R and Julies love-thang and we get a situation that seems alarmingly like the post-apocalyptic redemption imagined in the Book of Revelation ""There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain for the old order of things has passed away."" (Is Marion a Christian and is this resonance a conscious choice? It doesnt much matter but it certainly seems possible.) Im afraid Ive now succeeded in making ""Warm Bodies"" sound weird and interesting when mostly its more like dull and half-baked. Theres almost nothing in this movie that hasnt been done better by other filmmakers including the idea that zombies retain some shards of human identity -- see George A. Romeros underappreciated ""Day of the Dead"" -- and the walled-off human city where Julie and her hardass anti-zombie dad (John Malkovich in his recent gettin-paid mode) and other survivors live as seen in almost every apocalypse flick. Hoult and Palmer are plenty cute but their scenes together are totally devoid of heat perhaps to avoid us noticing that them getting together is basically necrophilia which is not so much a PG-13 thing. (Feel free to explore Bruce La Bruces ""Otto"" and ""L.A. Zombie"" for edification. Or on second thought dont.) Keep your standards really low for this one -- as in whats on TV is probably better but at least youre getting out of the house -- and youll be OK. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Youll never find zombies more charming By Mary Pols MaryPolsFeb. 01 2013 Share Read Later Jan Thijs/Summit Entertainment Warm Bodies Year 2013 Director Jonathan Levine Studio Summit Entertainment RelatedThe Fine Art of Schlock Why Studio Kitsch Like Hansel amp; Gretel Tends to Be So Bad Its...Awful20 Movies Were Looking Forward to in 2013 (and 5 Were Definitely Not) Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture Warm Bodies is the first movie worth paying to see in theaters this year. Its an inventive charmer that visits all the typical movie scenarios of young love amid chaos and disaster but with a new dimension one of the romantic leads is a zombie. There are so many clever lines and bits of physical comedy worth revisiting that the movie seems like a likely cult classic but its more inclusive than that. Even someone who has let The Walking Dead pass them by could fall for these brain-eaters. The main characters interior monologue a deadpan account of life as a zombie wins you over from the start. ""Why cant I connect with people?"" R (Nicholas Hoult) wonders. R knows his name was longer but he forgot the rest of it. He doesnt know what he did pre-apocalypse; ""My hoodie would suggest I was unemployed"" he guesses. He hangs out (lives isnt the right word) at a deserted airport with a crew of other zombies. The newer ones retain an ability to grunt at each other; occasionally R and his best friend M (Rob Corddry who makes a disconcertingly adorable zombie) may exchange a word or two. Its usually ""eat."" (READ TIMEs Nate Rawlings tells you everything you need to know about The Walking Dead) This is a typical day for me"" R tells us at the beginning of what will prove to not be a typical day at all. ""I shuffle around."" Hoult walks hunched over with his head cocked to the side. The posture is pure zombie but when he encounters and falls for a human survivalist Julie (Teresa Palmer) his careful heavy way of moving also suggests another monster we came to love Boris Karloffs Frankenstein. He and Julie have the strangest meet-cute ever; seconds after their eyes lock for the first time hes eating her boyfriends brains. But he saves her--theres a trick involving smearing her with blood to mask her human smell--and spirits her away to his lair in an abandoned airplane. R wants to learn to feel again; eating fresh brains allows the zombies to briefly experience the memories of the newly dead so from gobbling up Julies boyfriend he already knows what it might be like to kiss her. And youve never seen a boy so intent on not scaring away the girl of his dreams. ""Dont be creepy"" R reminds himself as if he could help it. There are so many pop-culture inspirations and references here its hard to keep track of all of them. At one point Julie and her best friend Nora (the excellent Analeigh Tipton) embark on a zombie makeover and Nora puts on the song ""Pretty Woman."" ""What? Its funny"" Nora protests when Julie shoots her a dirty look. Theres a convertible ride straight out of Ferris Buellers Day Off. And Bob Dylans ""Shelter from the Storm"" takes on new meaning when played in a post-plague America by a zombie hoping to get somewhere with a human girl. (READ TIMEs review of Warm Bodies director Jonathan Levines 50/50) Falling in love has an interesting humanizing effect on R which could have bigger ramifications. But complications ensue; of course Julie would be the daughter of the self-appointed general (John Malkovich) of a militia trying to exterminate the zombies. The post-apocalyptic world also has villains even more animalistic than the simple zombies -- skeletal creatures they all call the Boneys which are what emerge when the last shreds of humanity are gone from the zombies. Yes the idea of the undead brain-eaters still having humanity is incongruous but the movie sweeps you into this fantasy on top of fantasy until the zombie logic hardly matters. As for the dwindling humor in the last 20 minutes or the too-neat ending? Easy enough to overlook when the movie has already gotten you high. Warm Bodies was directed by Jonathan Levine whose last love story 50/50 also dealt with romance and mortality simultaneously although in a much more conventional way. Levine also wrote the screenplay adapting Isaac Marions 2011 bestseller of the same name. The story and the writing are both very clever--the impulse to pepper a review with quotes from Rs interior monologue speaks to how enticing it is--but the joy of the movie rests on the stars performances. Palmer is reminiscent of Kristen Stewart (but way more sunny) and previously played one of the supernatural-gifted teens in the unfortunate I Am Number Four (2011). She also had a small part in the nearly-as-dreadful The Sorcerers Apprentice (2010) exuding a notable energy but otherwise had little chance to impress. In Warm Bodies she gets to be brave and funny--and she gets to make flirting with a zombie seem feasible. (READ TIMES pan of a 2008 Adam Sandler movie in which the only thing Richard Corliss liked was Teresa Palmer.) Palmer has a lot of help from Hoults offbeat charisma. Remember About a Boy? He was the boy the kid who wasnt winsome--his mouth tended to hang open a little like Rs--yet who won over Hugh Grant anyway. Hoult was also in X-Men First Class and played a student with a crush on Colin Firth in A Single Man but weirdly being trapped inside an inexpressive zombies body is the role that shows his fullest range. Youd hate to see Warm Bodies stripped of his voiceover but Hoult gets laughs even when hes playing R as practically a silent-film character. Theres a scene where Julie and R hole up in an abandoned suburb. Levine cuts to Hoult sitting on a sofa reading an old copy of Us Weekly with a Kardashian on the cover. ""Kims Birthday Plans"" the headline reads and Hoults expression that of a man with a concussion trying to get his bearings in a very challenging world says it all. (WATCH The trailer for Hoults next movie Jack the Giant Slayer.) Mary Pols MaryPols Mary Pols has been reviewing film and occasionally books for TIME since 2009.

Zombies though -- these days not so much. Yes TVs ""The Walking Dead"" still arrives with a jolt. But ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Zombieland"" both found laughs among the reanimated corpses. And now ""Warm Bodies"" adds -- romance. But then love means never having to say youre gory. Set in an alternate present its another one of those zombie apocalypse stories with the hungry dead roaming the streets and the last few humans retreating to a survivalist encampment. The difference is this story is narrated by one of the zombies. A zombie who after hes done munching one guys frontal lobe loses his heart to the grieving girlfriend. Who kind of eventually falls for him. Can these crazy kids make it against all odds? Its like ""Romeo and Juliet"" -- or at least thats what the story not so subtly insists. The girls name is Julie. The boys name -- well he cant remember it so he just goes by R. (Or the way he pronounces it Arrrrrrrrr.) Theres even a nurse (her best friend) and a balcony scene. And while Julie doesnt say ""R R wherefore art thou R you poor brain-muncher"" its kind of understood. That subtext is a little strained and other parts of the film arent too thought out. Sometimes the zombies shuffle; sometimes they move really fast. Some of the effects -- particularly the really hard-core zombies called ""bonies"" -- are shabby and Julies character could use a little work. I mean its nice that shes so forgiving. But R did tear open her boyfriends skull and gobble up the insides like a cheap lunch special. No one would blame Julie if she held just a teensy bit of a grudge. But director Jonathan Levine (who last did the equally off-center ""50/50"") compensates by bringing welcome humor and offbeat touches to the material as well as an inventive use of locations and a nice visual sense. And he gets good performances from his actors. True as Julie Teresa Palmer isnt much more than a livelier blonder Kristen Stewart; Analeigh Tipton is much more interesting as her pal. (Note to Hollywood Want to double the appeal of any rom-com? Cast as usual. Then fire your female star and replace her with the actress youd hired to play her funky smart friend.) But Nicholas Hoult - once upon a time the bullied hero of ""About a Boy"" -- is truly great as R. He not only gets the stiff undead walk down; in one scene he recreates a zombie trying to mimic the natural loose walk of a human. Its a clever layered bit of physical acting and his narration is coolly mocking. ""Warm Bodies"" has a number of surprises like that too including some retro music choices (R has a fondness for oldies-but-moldies rock) and casting decisions (John Malkovich as the president? We really must be in the end times.) But the nicest surprise of all? In a genre thats grown so exhausted -- what are we up to ""Night of the Resident Evil Dead Part 23"" by now? -- ""Warm Bodies"" not only brings in some fresh blood but has brains to spare. Ratings note The film contains gory violence. Warm Bodies (PG-13) Summit (97 min.) Directed by Jonathan Levine. With Nicholas Hoult Teresa Palmer. Now playing in New Jersey.

By Mick LaSalle Updated 427 pm Thursday January 31 2013 Warm Bodies Zombie romance. Starring Nicholas Hoult Teresa Parker and John Malkovich. Directed by Jonathan Levine. (PG-13. 97 minutes.) Theres one really good idea at work in ""Warm Bodies"" which is to take ""Romeo and Juliet"" and mash it up with a zombie movie. Its the kind of idea that anyone can recognize and take pleasure in something with built-in comedy and built-in interest. But its an idea that defines and limits things going in. The audience knows exactly where the movie is heading and can only sit and wait for it to get there. Obviously this pictures one really good idea needed something. It needed a second really good idea something for the concept to bounce off of something to provide a dose of the unexpected. In the absence of that were left with a setup that guarantees only 15 minutes of wholehearted enjoyment followed by 80 minutes of intermittent mild amusement. ""Warm Bodies"" is good enough to make you root for it. Yet even if the material is mediocre at least its fully realized. Nicholas Hoult as the zombie boy named R is often very funny stumbling and grunting and trying to do his best. R explains his feelings in the voiceover narration so the audience is always aware of the distance between his social aspirations and his abilities. When he meets Julie (Teresa Palmer) he is at the ultimate disadvantage - hes a corpse - a situation that any guy can appreciate who has ever dated out of his league.

This film image released by Summit Entertainment shows Rob Corddry left and Nicholas Hoult in a scene from ""Warm Bodies."" Photo Jonathan Wenk Associated Press Warm Bodies review Zombie in love? 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Written and directed by Jonathan Levine (""50/50"") and adapted from the novel by Isaac Marion ""Warm Bodies"" takes place in a nightmarish postapocalyptic world following a plague that wiped out millions. The remaining humans live behind a wall surrounded by soldiers led by the human leader (John Malkovich). Meanwhile the zombies mostly shuffle around an abandoned airport making occasional forays outside to feed on the living literally. Actually if were talking about ""Romeo and Juliet"" parallels the humans representing the old guard in decline are rather like the Montagues and the zombies representing the brash up-and-coming faction are more like the Capulets. Therefore the girl should have been the zombie and the boy human - except that that never could have worked. If a girl likes a zombie boy the audience will believe that shes sincere. But if a boy likes a zombie girl the audience will simply assume that his desperation knows no limits. Because ""Warm Bodies"" lacks the ability to surprise it seems longer than it is and it isnt long at all. What pleasures it offers have less to do with what happens onscreen than with how things get done. An unexpected take a glance or a sight gag might lift a moment but it cant transform the general slog of the story. Still it looks convincing. The postapocalyptic world is rendered on a fairly grand scale and there are nice small touches as well. In the newspaper bin there are unsold papers whose headline reads ""The End?"" Thats an appropriate last edition. And by the time ""Warm Bodies"" heads into the stretch its impossible not to care about the fate of R and Julie so the movie isnt dead. Its almost living.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Feb. 01 2013 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Feb. 01 2013 1200AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Jonathan Levine Written by Jonathan Levine Starring Nicholas Hoult Teresa Palmer John Malkovich Classification PG Genre comedy Country USA The tale of a biologically mismatched young couple - she has vital signs he doesnt - Warm Bodies could be titled Romeo and Juliet and Zombies. Written and directed by Jonathan Levine (The Wackness 50/50) and adapted from a young-adult novel by Isaac Marion the movie is a good-natured romantic zombie comedy that plays like a tamer version of The Twilight Saga. Screen grab from trailer for ""Warm Bodies"" Movies Warm Bodies The official trailer CP Film Video Casey Walker talks zombie romcom Visual art Video Sculptor unveils massive zombie pumpkin display Set in an artfully dilapidated city and using a chilly bruise-coloured palette the film which was shot in Montreal begins with the voice-over of our hero (English actor Nicholas Hoult) wondering to himself about why he finds it so hard to connect with people. Then he remembers ""Oh right Im dead.""The films Juliet (named Julie and played by Australian actress Teresa Palmer) is a perky blond militia fighter and daughter of a widowed always-angry anti-zombie military leader (John Malkovich). They live in a heavily fortified compound with other survivors eight years after a zombie epidemic wiped out most of the humans including Julies mother.The Romeo in our story is simply called ""R"" because thats all he can remember. Also it pretty much meets the demands of most zombie social interactions. Rs best friend is named ""M"" (as in Romeo and Juliets Mercutio) played by The Daily Shows Rob Corddry The two friends grunt syllables at each other like co-workers whove been at the same office for too long.Otherwise they spend their time shambling about the ruined urban world looking for human nourishment (""At least I feel conflicted"" R rationalizes).Zombies are not the bottom feeders in this world - that would be the ""bonies"" ravenous skeletons (rendered in crummy-looking CGI) who feast on zombies and humans indiscriminately.Rs and Julies worlds collide when a zombie herd comes upon a company of humans out on a supply run. In the ensuing battle Julies gun-happy boyfriend Perry (Dave Franco) is killed and R true to his zombie nature feasts on Perrys brain absorbing his memories. A moment later he sees Juliet and is immediately attracted to her - and not just in a buffet-lunch kind of way.After saving Juliet from his fellow zombies R takes her to his home the fuselage of a plane at a no-longer functioning airport. Hiding out in their airplane to nowhere they sample Rs extensive vinyl collection including Bob Dylans Shelter from the Storm and of course Bruce Springsteens Hungry Heart. Julie wastes little time grieving for her dead beau and sees Rs potential - in spite of his lack of pulse. No doubt hes appealing with a mournful adoring gaze and an inability to argue though he seems more like a pet than a boyfriend. Hoult plays his zombie character like a young Frankensteins monster eager to please but with a tendency to growl and lurch.After its whimsical start Warm Bodies loses narrative momentum though there are flickerings of undead humour throughout. When R follows Julie back to the human compound he gets a make-over from her and her friend Nora (Analeigh Tipton) to allow him to pass as a healthy human. (True to Shakespeare again Julies sidekick is an aspiring nurse.) Soon Rs cheeks require no remedial blusher and the seamy veins on his neck have faded nicely Love has re-animated him and the effect has gone viral making the other zombies awake from their stupors. All thats left is to convince Julies father that zombies arent just salvageable but may even serve as an ally against the relentless even more dead ""bonies.""Warm Bodies is for audiences who prefer stories about mending hearts to munching brains and ideally for girls who arent quite sure yet if they want a slightly scary boyfriend or a living doll they can dress up.

Starring Analeigh Tipton Teresa Palmer John Malkovich Nicholas Hoult Lizzy Caplan Dave Franco Rob Corddry Cory Hardrict Justin Bradley Ayisha Issa Director Jonathan Levine Running time 137 Release Opened Feb 1 2013  Editorial Review This love story needs more biteBy Michael OSullivanFriday February 1 2013Cute without being especially clever ""Warm Bodies"" is almost as pallid and as brain-dead as its zombie antihero (Nicholas Hoult) a flesh-eating foot-dragging teenage corpse known as R who falls in love with a living human named Julie (Teresa Palmer) despite their obvious differences. Its less funny and self-aware than ""Shawn of the Dead"" less swooningly romantic than ""Twilight"" (to which it bears strong similarities) and less scary than pretty much anything else out there with zombies in it. Fans of ""The Walking Dead"" can keep moving; theres nothing to see here. This last part is true despite the addition of critters known as ""bonies."" Essentially zombies who have wasted away to skeletons theyre the films real bad guys but the CGI animation is so stiff and ironically unlifelike that they look like ghouls from a third-rate video game. The zombies themselves are more like something out of a Halloween party than a horror movie. The premise of ""Warm Bodies"" (based on the young adult novel by Isaac Marion) sounds good at least on paper. Loosely inspired by ""Romeo and Juliet"" -- R and Julie get it? -- the story centers on the incongruity of a romance between enemies. Julie is the daughter of Grigio (John Malkovich) the leader of a group of human survivors of some unspecified plague that has turned the rest of the world into cannibalistic cadavers. And R eats people. I give the relationship three months tops. After killing and eating Julies boyfriend Perry (Dave Franco) R starts to take a fancy to her. Part of the mythology of ""Warm Bodies"" is that zombies take on the memories of their victims after eating their brains. But if thats so why isnt R walking around with the voices of everyone he has ever eaten and not just Perrys rattling around in his head? It doesnt make much sense. Neither does Julies eventual attraction to R. Despite looking like a wino (and presumably smelling like a slaughterhouse) the boy gains favor with her first by saving her life and then by hiding her from his zombie friends. Never mind that he just killed and ate her main squeezes cerebellum like sushi. The movie glosses over this little detail albeit unconvincingly. Theres real potential here. The set-up is perfect to comment on the awkwardness of adolescent infatuation. ""Dont be a creep dont be a creep dont be a creep"" R says to himself as he stares like a well zombie at her. But for the most part the movie like its undead protagonist doesnt seem to know what to do with itself or how to take advantage of the storys quirky potential. Instead it relies on stale rom-com tropes. Theres even a falling-in-love montage in which R and Julie entertain each other wackily of course by trying on different pairs of sunglasses. Wait a minute what? Other wasted opportunities include Rob Corddry as Rs zombie friend M. (The joke is that neither one can remember his entire first name but its a tepid one.) The creator and star of ""Childrens Hospital"" is given no chance to exhibit any of the dark humor he exhibits on that television show. The whole ""Romeo and Juliet"" thing doesnt go much of anywhere either. That tale ended badly and this one is a teen comedy. As R spends more and more time with Julie he begins to come back to life a little suggesting that its love that makes us human and gives us a reason to live. Thats nice if not exactly new. ""Warm Bodies"" isnt exactly DOA but its pulse is weak.Contains mild zombie violence light gore and occasional obscenity.

"Review Warm Bodies lights twisted flame between girl zombie - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowReview Warm Bodies lights twisted flame between girl zombieWriter-director Jonathan Levine strikes the right tone in the horror/romance mash-up starring Nicholas Hoult as a slacker undead and Teresa Palmer as a human who somehow warms his cold soul.January 31 2013|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Even with Hollywoods magic touch zombies may never beat out those seductively stylish vampires for a Vanity Fair cover but something about the unfashionable undead makes them ripe for irony in the right hands a so many possibilities lurk behind those blank stares.The right hands at the moment seem to belong to Jonathan Levine. The writer-director certainly has a good grip on what to do with those cold souls in ""Warm Bodies"" a surprisingly sentimental mash-up starring Nicholas Hoult Teresa Palmer and John Malkovich.FOR THE RECORD ""Warm Bodies"" In the Feb. 1 Calendar section a review of the movie ""Warm Bodies"" referred to actress Teresa Palmers role in ""last years Love amp; Honor. "" ""Love amp; Honor"" was released internationally but has not yet played in the U.S. Adapted from novelist Isaac Marions playful romance among the ruined ""Warm Bodies"" stays true enough to the book a and rom-com conventions. Boy meets girl. Boy falls for girl. Lack of a pulse and bad hygiene keep them apart a|PHOTOS Walking Dead and the many meanings of zombiesBut in doing a little genre bending of romantic schmaltz and horror cheese a some fundamental zombie mythology is turned on its head a the film breathes amusing new life into both.The differences surface as soon as the movie turns up the volume on the inner voice of R a slacker zombie (Hoult) who spends his days thinking about the meaning of life now that hes forgotten his a except that his name began with an ""R."" Our narrator is left with only the memories of the latest cerebral cortex hes consumed as he shuffles through the rubble of a world brought to its knees by a zombie-creating virus.In the sometime-distant future of ""Warm Bodies"" the virus has split the populace into humans zombies and the super creepy ""boneys"" which really doesnt quite capture what happens when zombies cant stand the skin theyre in. Armed guards and a giant wall separate the decaying life forms from civilization otherwise known as dinner. A Big Brother-ish militia headed by the Big Brother-ish Malkovich who goes by the name Grigio in ""Warm Bodies"" controls the remains of the metropolis but you know Grigio is just being John Malkovich.Even in apocalyptic times the young act out. Grigios daughter Julie (Palmer) a new recruit to his army is ready to hunt down zombies but her authority issues remain. It doesnt take long for her to run into R. Though its not exactly love at first sight a shes blasting a machine gun and hes noshing on brains a something clicks. But its a war and so it takes time to light the flame. In fact Levine has put the movie on zombie time a very slow. The battle breaks become a good excuse to entertain us with the implications of a zombie crush a awkward flirting.PHOTOS Hollywood Backlot momentsDespite their differences R and Julie make a nice couple. Hes a good listener shes got a lot on her mind. And how can I say this? Blank looks become Hoult and those lanky limbs make the lumbering and lurching quite believable. When words fail him a zombies are hard-pressed to move beyond a grunt a his shrug says a thousand words as Hoult finds the right blend of slacker pathos and indifference.""Warm Bodies"" must come as a relief for Palmer who has had a string of forgettable roles as ""the blond"" or more typically ""the other blond"" a as in ""I Am Number Four"" where she was Number 6.... Even in last years ""Love amp; Honor"" co-starring with Liam Hemsworth Palmer was primarily the prize. In ""Bodies"" the actress has a chance to prove shes more than a pretty face with a nice comic turn at playing the undead and a nicer one at playing a girl falling in love.Messing around with the romantic equation in unexpected and improbable ways is becoming a Levine specialty. A few years ago his ""50/50"" found humor and heart in cancer threading the needle between a guy fighting cancer and at the same time searching for love.""Warm Bodies"" takes off in other equally interesting directions. What Levines films have in common is a kind of decency and dignity the characters are given without devolving into mush. While there are deeper ideas being toyed with a what makes life worth living for one a ultimately ""Warm Bodies"" is content to figure out what a girl wants. And that my fellow zombies is enough.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com PHOTOS AND MORE VIDEO The making of Argo Les Miz and more ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz PHOTOS NC-17 movies Ratings explained MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESReview Radiant self-deluded life experienced In the...June 6 2013New releases In Warm Bodies zombie has a sensitive sideJune 2 2013Teen girls give zombie romance Warm Bodies a healthy box...February 3 2013Ticket sales to slow as Americans stay home for Super BowlJanuary 31 2013In Warm Bodies girl meets ... zombieJanuary 31 2013MORE STORIES ABOUTMovies_nowNot_live_webEntertainment_not_live_webCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-warm-bodies-20130201,0,3859723.story",200,warmbodies16,warmbodies,latimes

Scott Bowles USA TODAY 912 p.m. EST February 1 2013Zombie story makes Twilight look positively intellectual.Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer star in the zombie-meets-girl story Warm Bodies.(Photo Jonathan Wenk Summit Entertainment)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review  out of fourStars Nicholas Hoult Teresa Palmer Rob Corddry John MalkovichRated PG-13; Runtime 1 hour 37 minutes; Opens Friday nationwideWarm Bodies pulls a nifty trick in the red-hot zombie genre It lacks a brain though it eats plenty of them.Geared for teens who perhaps found the Twilight series too profound Warm Bodies (  out of four; rated PG-13; opens nationwide Friday) is an unabashed homage to that wildly successful franchise. One of its stars Teresa Palmer is even done up to be a carbon copy of Kristen Stewart the anchor of the vampire series.But Twilight is a think piece compared with Bodies. While its a sweet-natured take on the living dead and will tantalize kids who cant get enough girl-ghoul romance Bodies somehow defies logic even for a monster movie.VIDEO Zombie love hits L.A. at Bodies premiereREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYFrom the outset it establishes itself as an undead flick with a twist R (Nicholas Hoult) is an outsider zombie a rebel without a pulse. He like most of the world has been turned into a pale slow-shuffling creature on a flesh-only diet.Unlike his zombie buds though R is pretty self-actualized. He may have lost most of his synapses and cant remember the rest of his name but he manages a snarky voice-over lamenting how slow and pale hes become.He and his metabolically challenged neighbors live in an airport where they stumble and mumble their way through the day. Its a clever setting particularly Rs apartment a jumbo jet hes filled with classic vinyl albums and posters. While Bodies doesnt explain why the community would hole itself up in a facility without humans it makes for great visuals. And there are nice parallels to the real world as R complains that no one interacts anymore theyre so wrapped up in their own un-lives.And he occasionally gets to snack when the dwindling human population led by the heartless Gen. Grigio (John Malkovich) invades the airport to hunt for supplies.There R meets Julie (Palmer). His body may not fully function but his libido does. After eating her boyfriend Perry (Dave Franco) R sees and immediately falls for Julie.After that any sense of consistency is out the window. Julie sees her man turned to brunch but doesnt flee when R approaches to flirt. She looks deep into his vacant eyes as he caresses her and paints her face with blood-stained fingers and seems fine with being escorted to Rs digs where he hopes to save her from becoming an appetizer.Within minutes theyre dancing to Rs collection of hits from Roy Orbison Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan (the soundtrack is terrific). When they get bored Julie teaches R how to drive on the tarmac in a BMW convertible (someone must have left the keys in it).The film rationalizes the love story by having Julie explain that she always figured Perry would be a zombie Hot Pocket anyway so the loss isnt that bad.Stranger still is the reaction from the other zombies who accept her in their community the moment they see the couple hold hands. They even begin healing themselves somehow cracking jokes and picking up their gait.Its a convenient setup to begin the alliance of zombies and humans against the films real villains ""bonies"" the long-dead zombies who dont care for undevolved corpses. And they can run faster than Olympic legend Usain Bolt.There are other breaks from the genre When a zombie eats human brains it inherits the memories of the devoured. It makes for a handy cheat sheet as R tries to win Julies affection. Of course the couple wont kiss until R is sufficiently cute and human. Zombies may eat your intestines but kissing one in mid-decomposition would be like gross.Chances are kids arent going to care about plot holes. They want to see the girl fall for the rebel boy on the wrong side of the heartbeat.Still if you seek logic in your movies this one is in nearly every respect a head-scratcher. 78 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/VyiPeE",http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~r/UsatodaycomMovies-TopStories/~3/HZcVa7ddWjE/,200,warmbodies17,warmbodies,usatoday

Howd You Die? Credit Summit Entertainment The Italian art-house film Caesar Must Die and the teen zombie-comedy Warm Bodies do not at first glance appear to have much in common. But they share a bit of creative DNA both being inventive riffs that turn Shakespearean tragedies into something else entirely. Start with the one thats more or less Shakespeare straight -- straight as it can be in Italian anyway. Caesar Must Die takes its audience both behind the scenes and behind bars at the maximum security wing of Rebibbia prison outside Rome to watch a select group of inmates rehearsing Julius Caesar just a few miles from the spot where the real Caesar was slain. The folks on-screen are actual convicts -- murderers drug traffickers mafiosi -- and yes the stabbing death of Caesar even in rehearsal feels real. But Caesar Must Die is not a documentary. The Taviani brothers Paolo and Vittorio have been blurring the line between reality and fiction in their films for six decades. Here although they identify the convicts and their crimes early on just as they would in a nonfiction film they also script every moment -- blending life offstage and on until its hard to say whether the lifers scrambling to their cells after a jail-yard assassination are acting or simply engaged in self-preservation. Eventually rehearsals shot in black-and-white give way to the vibrant color of a public performance that ends with cheers and a standing ovation. The men and their characters seem briefly indistinguishable. i Brutus (Salvatore Striano) delivers the final blow to the dying Caesar (Giovanni Arcuri) during a performance of Shakespeares Julius Caesar in the film Caesar Must Die.

Adopt Films Then they return to their cells Caesars head bowed Cassius subdued as the door clangs shut behind him and he surveys his spartan surroundings. ""Since I got to know art"" he says ""this cell has become a prison."" Caesar Must Die Directors Paolo Taviani Vittorio Taviani Genre Drama Running Time 76 minutes Not rated; some intense scenes With Cosimo Rega Salvatore Striano Giovanni Arcuri (Recommended) If Caesar Must Die straddles the line between fact and fiction Warm Bodies invents a whole new genre. Its a romantic-comedy riff on Romeo and Juliet involving zombies -- a rom-zom-com if you will. Its star-crossed lovers a rosy-cheeked heroine named Julie (Teresa Palmer) who complains about her overprotective father and a paler-than-pale hero with vacant eyes (Nicholas Hoult) who is livelier -- at least in voiceover -- than you might expect. ""Why cant I connect with people?"" he wonders. ""Oh right its because Im dead."" R who can only remember the first letter of his name (but whats in a name right?) is a walking-dead Romeo whos dimly aware that his appetite for fresh brains is a handicap when hes around a pretty girl. Still hes gallant enough to rescue Julie when her friends are killed in an encounter with his flesh-eating buddies. A little slow on the verbal uptake -- no ""parting is such sweet sorrow"" for this guy -- R has a Mercutio-like buddy named M (Rob Corddry) whos willing to do battle for him. Julie meanwhile has a reluctantly supportive Nurse-like pal (Analeigh Tipton) and though theres only a zombie plague on one of their houses there is a balcony scene before things head in a more undead direction for a decidedly nontragic disappointingly conventional battle finale. Theres not a lot of gore -- or even suspense -- in Warm Bodies and the script plays fast and loose with the zombie rules invented by Night of the Living Dead creator George Romero. (Whose last name lets note is just Romeo with an extra R). But director Jonathan Levines area of expertise is confused-young-men comedies like The Wackness and 50/50 so he really gets this heros predicament. And like the Taviani brothers in Caesar Must Die he finds strategies in Warm Bodies to make what has long been considered a deathless tale undead in a new way. Remarkable when smart directors hold the Bards mirror up to nature what gets reflected.

By Cary Darlingdfw.comPosted 238pm on Thursday Jan. 31 2013 Thursday Jan. 31 2013 Thursday Jan. 31 2013 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Weve had slow zombies fast zombies and funny zombies. Now with Warm Bodies romantic zombies have shuffled into the mix.That sound you hear? Its Night of the Living Dead diehards collectively retching.If only Warm Bodies were easy to dismiss as merely some sort of corporately contrived bandwagon-hopping boondoggle. Based on a novel by Isaac Marion and written/directed by Jonathan Levine (who made one of the best films of 2011 with 50/50 as well as the critically adored All the Girls Love Mandy Lane) Warm Bodies is a sweetly funny and touching riff on Beauty and the Beast or Romeo and Juliet -- if the Beast feasted on flesh or Romeo came back from the dead.Nicholas Hoult (X-Men First Class) is a lurching lonely zombie named R (he can only remember the first letter of his name). He hangs out at the airport grunting pleasantries to his best friend M (Rob Corddry) collecting cool stuff from the pre-apocalypse (lots of classic-rock vinyl) and avoiding the ""bonies"" zombies whove completely decayed into ravenous rampaging skeletons and lost all contact with their humanity.But he still craves his meals to be of the two-legged variety and when he runs across a team of young humans from the walled city on a recon mission for supplies they make for a nice snack -- especially Perry (Dave Franco Scrubs) the boyfriend of Julie (Teresa Palmer Love and Honor) whom he cant bring himself to kill. Feeling something he hasnt experienced since his death R saves her from the other ghouls takes her back to his hiding place on a crumbling airplane and plays some John Waite which gets her thinking that maybe these zombies arent so bad after all.Its no happily-ever-after though as her dad (John Malkovich) is the leader of whats left of the humans and an avowed zombie slayer. And the bonies sensing their less decomposed comrades may be flickering back to life are on the warpath. Whats young love to do?Sure logic -- even by zombie movie standards -- is thrown out the window. At first the zombies are as slow as rush-hour traffic but later they become Olympic sprinters when the plot calls for it.But that doesnt matter as Levine has crafted an engaging tale of unlikely young love that like his other films reverberates with a heartfelt humanity. The message may be obvious -- were all just a little undead until connecting with someone outside ourselves -- but its still effective.Warm Bodies isnt laugh-out-loud funny but it has enough humor to save it from mawkishness while the bonies provide the few requisite frights.Classicists whod rather see zombies turning humans into luncheon meat rather than love objects shouldnt take this too hard. Theyve got new episodes of The Walking Dead coming soon and the epic zombie-battle blockbuster World War Z opening in June.Besides whats going to happen after the first zombie-human breakup? A zombie on the hunt for dinner and revenge could be an awesome sight to behold. Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

The movie has a wry sense of humor that manages to coexist with its all-you-need-is-love theme.It offers hope and sympathy for the dead Other a quirky concept for a brand of monster used for post-apocalyptic target practice on AMCs The Walking Dead and other recent films.We first meet R (Nicholas Hoult) as he stumbles through the dark airport he calls home and explains in self-aware voiceover why its a bummer to be a zombie. He seems like a nice enough young man a little green around the gills and a tad guilt-ridden about having to dine on human flesh. But hey a zombies gotta eat and R -- he cant remember the rest of his name -- is resigned to munching on his former fellow man.Then he meets Julie (Teresa Palmer) a zombie fighter and daughter of the headman in charge (John Malkovich in clipped military mode). R immediately knows this one is different. He doesnt want to eat her; he wants to save her. At first his fellow zombies including a sly Rob Corddry are skeptical (and hungry). But the slowly developing bond between dead boy and live girl proves contagious. The dead start coming back to life all except the snarling boneys ravenous skeletons too far gone to learn new tricks.Warm Bodies wisely avoids excess exposition -- we dont even know how this particular zombie apocalypse commenced -- in favor of its core optimistic concept. This is a smart playful teen rom-com about mismatched lovers one of whom happens to be dead. Its wise to the conventions of its genre including a makeover scene in which Julie and her best friend (Analeigh Tipton) turn R into something resembling a red-blooded American boy. Hoult gangly pale and self-effacing could be a struggling outcast in a John Hughes movie.Gore fiends will be disappointed at the lack of splatter but the decision to go light on the blood helps define the movies identity as a love story rather than a horror movie. Writer-director Jonathan Levine is best-known for the unlikely cancer comedy 50/50; he also made the hip-hop coming-of-age story The Wackness. Like that movie Warm Bodies displays nimble pop music instincts ranging from the wistful (the National Bon Iver) to the rowdy (Scorpions ""Rock You Like a Hurricane"").Short (97 minutes) and sweet Warm Bodies makes for a nice seasonal distraction from the big awards-season slate that draws moviegoers out in an obligatory rush. It doesnt take itself too seriously it doesnt get soapy and it reminds us that even monsters can fall in love. If you doubt it just ask King Kong and Fay Wray.Follow Chris Vognar on Twitter at chrisvognar.WARM BODIESB+ Directed by Jonathan Levine. PG-13 (zombie violence and some language). 97 mins.

By Dana Stevens Nicholas Hoult as R. in Warm Bodies Photo by Jonathan Wenk (c) 2012 Summit Entertainment LLC. After youve seen Warm Bodies come back and listen to our Spoiler Special podcast with Dana Stevens and Keith Phipps. Click the audio player below or download the podcast. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Theres a built-in obstacle to the high concept of Warm Bodies from writer/director Jonathan Levine whose zombie rom-com riffs on the Twilight formula of pairing a mortal girl with an undead boy Not many people fantasize about getting it on with a zombie. Vampires--at least movie vampires who have long existed at a considerable remove from Bram Stokers original foul-breathed Count Dracula--are brooding suave marble-skinned and sexy possessed of superhuman physical gifts of strength and speed. Zombies are shuffling mindless visibly decaying ambulatory corpses who (with rare exceptions as in the 28 Days movies) can be outrun by all but the lowest-paid movie extras. In the Twilight series Edward was a teenager preserved eternally at the height of his youthful beauty. R. (Nicholas Hoult) the undead hero of Warm Bodies looks more like a pouty-lipped teen idol whose body has been moldering for six months in a dumpster. The fact of zombies relative unsexiness neednt necessarily preclude the possibility of a zom-rom-com but Levines likable-enough fourth feature (his first three were All the Boys Love Mandy Lane The Wackness and 50/50) never quite rises to the challenge. I did enjoy Warm Bodies premise as explained in a quite funny opening voice-over that riffs on the loneliness of the single boy in the unfeeling crowd. R. a particularly soulful and introspective young zombie introduces the post-apocalyptic landscape he calls home as he reflects that when you spend most of your days staggering through an abandoned airport past crowds of fellow lurching brain-eaters its tough to really connect. The closest thing he has to a friend is M. (Rob Corddry) who occasionally sits with R. at a dust-covered airport bar and grunts sympathetically. Advertisement The zombie community inhabits a shadow world whose laws and customs are never quite clear--a fuzziness that becomes a real problem in the movies plot-driven third act. After a global apocalypse whose origin like his full name R. can no longer remember the world has been divided into the undead and the living who build fortified walls to protect themselves from the marauding brain-eaters on the other side. General Grigio (an off-his-game John Malkovich) who seems--again vaguely--to be the commander of an anti-zombie militia sends a group of young fighters including his daughter Julie (Teresa Palmer) on a mission across the wall. Nearly all the humans are killed in a zombie raid but fair Julie gets rescued by R. whos fallen in love at first sight. He takes her to his hideout on an abandoned airplane--a hovel full of vinyl records and other treasures R. has scavenged from the once beautiful world around him. This middle section which should have been the movies most charming never quite takes off into the romantic stratosphere. Maybe thats because R.s refusal to take Julie back to the world of the living upon her request smacks uncomfortably of abduction--though he insists hes only trying to keep her safe from the brain-eaters there are hints that hes exaggerating the risk in order to keep her there longer. Or maybe its just that the ramping up of their romance is too uneven--in one scene Julie is shrinking in repulsion from the monster whos holding her hostage; in the next shes taking him for a giggly joyride in a long-undriven sportscar. Nicholas Hoults shambling insecure hero has an appealingly guileless sweetness but its hard to do a lot with a character whose history and motives are this vague. (Why does R. alone among zombies have this capacity for self-reflection?) It doesnt help that R. speaks mainly in grunts for the first half of the film though his voice-over-- ""Dont be creepy dont be creepy"" he instructs himself as he nervously approaches his beloved--provides some welcome psychological context as well as the majority of the movies laughs. The preternaturally pretty Palmer brings an unusual amount of spunk to her damsel-in-distress role--she has a game jock-ish quality that makes her believable as a warrior and could have seen her through better action scenes than this movie provides. Levine seems more at ease with the scenes involving romance and friendship (including a touching dramatic moment with an unusually subdued Corddry) than during the choppy rushed late sequences in which zombies and humans alike are set upon by a digitally animated army of ""bonies"" extra-dessicated fast-moving superzombies who are never entirely convincing either as a plot contrivance a threat or a special effect. Warm Bodies which is based on a novel by Isaac Marion explicitly presents itself as a Romeo and Juliet story from the names of its central couple to a classic wherefore-art-thou balcony scene. But though its about a pair of lovers whose passion is strong enough to break down the barriers between life and death this mildly amusing sort-of-sweet comedy is strangely sexless and passion-free--these bodies whether human or zombie feel room-temperature at best.

""Corpses"" meanwhile are shamblers with -20 intelligence but with +20 charisma and a neutral/cute alignment. The story (adapted from the novel by Isaac Marion) is based on Romeo and Juliet in the same way as an essay by a high school freshman with basic cultural awareness of the plot but who didnt do the reading. Julie (Teresa Palmer) the daughter of post-apocalyptic zombie fighter John Malkovich is separated from her adorable Y/A team by a group of hungry zombies including ""R"" (Nicholas Hoult) the soulful corpse who kills her boyfriend. He develops a crush and drags her back to his airport lair to protect her from the other less understanding undead. ""R"" narrates in wry voice-over the lucidity of his interior life a contrast to his understandable difficulty with language. Still its weird listening to zombies talk at all particularly in sentences of more than two words. As the zombie culture at large becomes exposed to the romantic chemistry between ""R"" and Julie the corpses begin showing signs of life signified by single heart palpitations. The evil ""bonies"" who hate love set out in pursuit of the couple mostly because once you endow your films zombies with relatability and courage you need to find some new bad guys. The films intentions are way too good for its own good producing bloodless romance and more shamefully bloodless carnage. Nobody kisses anyone else until it becomes clear that both parties have pulses and everyone gets to keep all their limbs.

The premise works better than you might think.  |  out of 4 stars By Colin Covert Star Tribune February 1 2013 -- 601am Video (5101)  Another zombie movie? This ones a zom-rom-com according to movie critic Colin Covert. Shari L. Gross Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint With his lanky frame pale complexion and yearning eyes the romantic hero of ""Warm Bodies"" resembles Robert Pattinsons ""Twilight"" vampire without the glitter. Hes a different breed of supernatural boy -- the walking dead flesh-eating sort. With his reduced brain function he cant even recall his name except that it began with R. So R (as in ""Rrrrrr"") has the standard adolescent identity crisis on top of romantic longings. When this undead Romeo meets perky survivalist Julie one of the few human holdouts in a post-apocalyptic world we have the makings of the most agreeable paranormal romance since Seth Grahame-Smiths ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" crawled up the New York Times bestseller list. Granted its not an easy sell to present a clammy brain-gorging cadaver as a young adult dreamboat. It helps immensely that hes played by Nicholas Hoult (of ""X-Men First Class"") who makes Rs shuffling body language bug-eyed stares and inarticulate murmurs a sharp satire of disheveled youth. Were encouraged to adopt his viewpoint as he guides us through his universe and into a double parody of horror films and love stories. Director Jonathan Levine who successfully mixed cancer drama and comedy in ""50/50"" knows how to make such unlikely cocktails go down smoothly. Rs introspective voice-over narration lets us know hes a goodhearted fellow even if that organ stopped beating several years ago amid the zombie plague. ""What am I doing with my life?"" he muses. ""Im so pale. I should get out more. I should eat better."" On typical days he shuffles around a derelict airport ( ""Im not sure why. People wait at airports I guess""). The versatile comic character actor Rob Corddry plays Rs best friend M. Summit Entertainment Nicholas Hoult is the romantic zombie ""R"" in ""Warm Bodies."" ""By best friend I mean we occasionally grunt and stare awkwardly at each other"" R explains. ""Days pass this way."" Its a guy thing. In addition to putting us on Rs side with humor the film creates a group of villains worse than the zombies. Theyre the skeletal Boneys who are uglier faster and more ruthless than zombies eating the living without the qualms that make R oddly sympathetic. While foraging for living meat outside a cordoned-off city R and his crew stumble upon young human scavengers gathering hospital supplies. In a gory twist on the traditional meet-cute -- call it an eat-cute -- R devours the brain of Julies boyfriend (Dave Franco) and experiences his memories of falling in love. Moved R rescues Julie houses her in the airliner he has converted into a bachelor pad and plays her some old vinyl records. Bit by bit she lowers her guard and he becomes increasingly human death warmed over. Soon hes dreaming and on the shuffling path to recovery. Theres another big hurdle for the pair to clear though. Julies hyper-protective father Col. Grigio (John Malkovich) leads the local militia. Hes primed to splatter Rs brain clean out from under his floppy bangs. While Malkovich approaches his silly role with Method solemnity Hoult and Corddry get the good-natured goofiness of the piece. Teresa Palmer gives Julie an ingenues softness and a persuasive way with a machete. As her dubious funny best friend Analeigh Tipton gives Palmer a real tug-of-war for possession of their shared scenes. ""Warm Bodies"" is surely the zombie love story of the season. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

""Oh right its because Im dead."" More about Warm Bodies >> Yes R - played with droll panache and a Frankensteinian gait by Nicholas Hoult - is a zombie. Its been eight years since a plague turned the United States into a nation of pale vacant-eyed walking dead with only a shrinking band of flesh-and-blood humans holed up in a walled city still fighting the good fight. But R isnt like the rest of his kind. And when he saves the lovely and very much alive Julie (Teresa Palmer) from being feasted on by his cadaverous cohorts R discovers feelings he didnt know he had. Could this be love? It could. Warm Bodies adapted from Isaac Marions novel by filmmaker Jonathan Levine (50/50 The Wackness) is an enjoyably clever and cartoonishly gory rom-zom-com. Boy meets girl. Boy stops girl from having her brains eaten. Boy makes a case for the audio superiority of vinyl over MP3s . . . oh we digress. (But he does make the case. Spinning Dylan and Springsteen on his trusty turntable the awkward but earnest fellow explains how old-fashioned 331/3 r.p.m. albums have it all over digital.) A clever conflation of emo teen romance and grisly George Romero escapades Warm Bodies also argues for tolerance and understanding in a divided world. Is taking up arms and blowing the heads off staggering drooling cretins really the best way to go about things? Julies dad the zombie-hunter General Grigio (John Malkovich amusingly cast and sporting bandoleros strapped across his flak jacket) certainly thinks so. But when his daughter finds herself falling for the ""complicated zombie"" R and vice versa its like the Capulets and the Montagues all over again - only the Montagues dont have a pulse. Hoult a Brit and Palmer an Aussie slip smoothly into American speech patterns and patter and its fun to watch the actor as he transitions from inarticulate hunched-over undead to a soulful dude. Theres an antic on-the-run scene early on with Hoult flaying his arms weirdly as he tries to keep pace with the fleet-footed Palmer. Analeigh Tipton arching her eyebrows and getting off a few arch lines is Julies best friend Nora. And Rob Corddry seriously sallow and lumbering is Rs buddy M. Their particular pod of zombies have taken over an airport where R makes his home in a plane out on the tarmac. The arrivals and departure signs long ago stopped functioning.

Director Jonathan Levine (137) PG-13 Violence language. Area theaters. Based on the novel by Isaac Marion this update of ""Romeo and Juliet"" takes place after an apocalypse has divided the worlds population into staggering flesh-eating corpses and naturally militant vigilantes trying to shoot those zombies in the head. Nicholas Hoult (""About a Boy"" ""X-Men First Class"") plays the undead loafer known only as ""R"" who falls in love with human Julie (Theresa Palmer) after eating her boyfriends brains. Writer-director Jonathan Levine sets up this idiotic premise in unusually clever ways complete with the pop-music cues and sentimental energy of a John Hughes romance. Another more recent movie romance -- the ""Twilight"" series -- is also evoked thanks to ""Rs"" pale face eerie blue eyes and monster makeup masking his male-model looks. But the leads here are much more appealing than in that blockbuster franchise. Hoults genuinely awkward charm and Palmers tomboyish wholesomeness disarm an audience overfamiliar with this story. The two ably communicate the primitive and irrational feelings of falling in love. The setting of Zombie HQ is also unexpectedly witty. After all what location is more soulless yet undead than a modern airport? On mobile?

It would always end with the same line ""And his name was Adam. And her name was Eve."" ""Warm Bodies""? Apres-apocalypse zombie falls for a still-living girl. And his name was Romeo and her name was Juliet. (Actually hes ""R"" as in ""Rrrrr"" and shes Julie.) Theres even a balcony scene but if Shakespeare hadnt come up with any dialogue more interesting than ""Julie Julie -- I came to see you"" his plays would have closed in Stratford-off-Avon. Nicholas Hoult (the boy in ""About a Boy"") plays the thoughtful zombie R (he cant remember the rest of his name) who cant really talk or help murdering humans. But (in internal narration only we can hear) he yearns to be more than just another dead man walking. Munching on the brain of a young dude (Dave Franco) R downloads all the guys sweetest memories especially of his girl Julie (Teresa Palmer) whom R saves from other zombies and hides in a plane at the airport where all the ""corpses"" as living people call them wander all day. He plays her Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan songs feeds her airline food and occasionally fends off attackers. Gradually a combination of Rs taking on the dead guys feelings and his fondness for Julie causes him to literally warm to her touch. She in turn doesnt mind that he ate her boyfriend. Could opposites attract? Could love save the world? Could this script be any more trite? As in ""Silver Linings Playbook"" the plot is basically about how to take an outcast with a history of violence poor social skills and a bad wardrobe and turn him into a fully realized human being with emotions and dreams and conversation -- in other words turn him into a girl. At least R doesnt have to do any ballroom dancing though Julie and her best friend (Analeigh Tipton) do spend a scene dolling him up with makeup allegedly to make him look like a normal human. (If so -- why the eyeliner?) The movie is based on a novel by Isaac Marion which in turn is based on a lot of other stuff just as Palmer appears to be about a 90 percent accurate replica of Kristen Stewart. If there was an original idea in the script other than the one about the zombies favorite magazine (US Weekly) I missed it. The leads are likeable enough but the script reanimates ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" tactics -- a monster story supposedly made hilarious by being told by a savvy high schooler. These lines arent even jokes though theyre just collisions of the brutal and the banal ""I know its really hard to meet guys right now with the apocalypse and stuff."" Marion and director-screenwriter Jonathan Levine (""50/50"") havent bothered to even work out the rules of their universe. R delivers cute lines about how boring it is to have to walk slowly but when ""Warm Bodies"" is trying to do a scary chase scene he runs. He complains that he and his best friend (Rob Corddry) cant do anything except moan and stare awkwardly but minutes later hes talking to Julie in multiple-word sentences. Other zombies let Julie walk among them without noticing then later smell her living flesh and attack but then theyre fooled by her acting like a zombie. So are they guided by smell or not? And why do the ruthless skeleton zombies the ""boneys"" attack the ordinary ""corpses"" only at the end when the two groups have been coexisting at the airport? Do boneys eat dead flesh or not? If corpses can be reformed not just by falling in love but merely by looking at pictures of people in love posted at the airport where they live wouldnt they have seen the images a long time ago? I can hear the 14-year-olds ""Shut up Cant you see how beautiful R and Julies love is?"" Despite the loads of my-soul-is-abloom emo on the soundtrack no. I realize Im siding with the crusty-dad figure played by John Malkovich but its not that I disapprove of zombie-human dating. I just dont like having my brain eaten by dead writing.

Jonathan Wenk/Summit Entertainment SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED INFO Warm Bodies Good 4 stars Director Jonathan Levine. Cast Nicholas Hoult Teresa Palmer John Malkovich Dave Franco. Rating PG-13 for zombie violence and some language. RELATED NEWS Interview Jonathan Levine with Video Interview Dave Franco By Barbara VanDenburgh The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Jan 31 2013 1037 AM Boy meets girl. Boy eats girls boyfriends brain. Boy woos girl with radical vinyl collection. And these crazy kids just might have a chance if the girl can stop her dad from shooting her new zombie love in the head. Yes zombie. Hollywood has indulged in its fair share of supernatural hookups in the past few years so much so that human-vampire and vampire-werewolf pairings are starting to become rote (thanks ""Twilight""). But a pretty girl falling head over heels for an undead husk of rotting flesh? How does that work exactly? First it helps if your zombie is played by Nicholas Hoult who couldnt help being dreamy despite all the white face cream and ice-blue contact lenses in the world. A relatively fresh-looking zombie who can remember only that his living name began with the letter ""R"" he hangs with his cohorts in the shell of an abandoned airport (sorry guys we still have to deal with the TSA in our post-apocalyptic hellscape) where they shuffle and grunt away from the public eye until its time to feed. During one of these lunch runs into the city R stumbles across a pack of scavenging human survivors including Julie (Teresa Palmer) and her boyfriend (Dave Franco) whom R proceeds to eat. In this zombie universe eating a brain passes on the memories of the victim to the muncher. R is instantly assaulted with stolen memories of Julie and the idylls of young love experiencing in a flash all of the dead boyfriends passion for his beautiful feisty girlfriend. And just like that R is smitten. He coerces a terrified Julie to follow him back to the dilapidated airplane he calls home where with the aid of some sweet-sounding vinyl and the occasional burst of halting monosyllabic speech he tries against all odds to win her over. Based on the young-adult novel by Isaac Marion the lighthearted zombie-human romance might seem a strange next step for director Jonathan Levine the talented filmmaker behind 2011s affecting low-budget ""5/0."" But its not simply cashing in on a craze -- be it zombies young-adult-novel adaptations or supernatural romances. There isnt a cynical bone in this films achingly sincere body. And its not really a horror movie unless the ""horror"" in question is the all-consuming awkwardness of young love. The voiceover commentary running through Rs head could pass for that of any teenager falling hard for a pretty girl. ""Dont be creepy dont be creepy dont be creepy"" R chants to himself as his unwavering ghoulish gaze borders on obsessive leering -- good advice both for the undead and hormonally charged living. Its also easy to relate on a personal level to Julies gun-toting father (a delightfully cast John Malkovich) when he doesnt take kindly to the budding romance. What overprotective father hasnt entertained thoughts of threatening his young daughters sketchy new boyfriend zombie or otherwise? As zombie movies go ""Warm Bodies"" doesnt rank near the top of the pack. It falls short of the piercing social commentary and gore of George Romeros best films and lacks the wit and mania of such lighthearted icons as ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Zombieland."" But as a young-adult romance its ace. And thats what the film means to be anyway -- not a cold shambling corpse but an exposed heart warm and pulsing with life. No its not the best zombie film but it may well be the cutest.

(AP Photo/Summit Entertainment Jonathan Wenk) If youre a zombie purist or a fan of ""The Walking Dead"" ""Warm Bodies"" is not for you.Same goes if you dont think a zombie-romantic comedy is a viable mashup. (Zom-com anyone?)""Warm Bodies"" is a cuddly zombie flick for fans of ""Twilight"" and other frothy fare. In this ""Romeo and Juliet""-esque tale of star-crossed lovers hes a zombie and shes alive. All sorts of romantic hilarity ensues. The movies tag line ""Hes still dead but hes getting warmer"" says a lot about where the film is coming from.Light on blood and gore in accordance with its PG-13 rating ""Warm Bodies"" is scrubbed of any terror and the one-liners never stop coming.R (Nicholas Hoult) is among the walking dead after a plague wipes out most of society. R (he cant remember his name -- Romeo maybe?) looks more like a stoned slacker than a zombie. He wanders through an airport wearing a red hoodie grunting while constant voiceovers tell us whats on his mind.Hes mostly in search of human brains and he and his zombie pals find some when they attack a group of attractive teen survivors including Julie (Teresa Palmer who at times resembles a blonde Kristen Stewart) and her boyfriend Perry (Dave Franco).R eats Perrys brains unbeknownst to Julie and now has all of Perrys memories making Rs attraction to Julie instant.""Theres more than one way to get to know a girl"" R muses in voiceover. ""Eating her dead boyfriends brain is more unorthodox."" (Sigh.) Later trying to form words to speak to Julie R thinks ""Dont be creepy dont be creepy."" (Double sigh.)R rescues Julie numerous times from the other zombies and takes her to his home a grounded airplane where its revealed hes a bit of a hoarder -- and even a vinyl collector. (""Better sound"" he manages.)Julie trusts R while not understanding his protection over her. When she learns R ate Perrys brain its a real mood killer. Meanwhile Julies militia head father (John Malkovich) looks to shoot dead any zombie within range even one with seemingly human feelings like R.Though on the surface falling in line with any ""Twilight"" film ""Warm Bodies"" is better produced acted and written which isnt saying a lot.Director Jonathan Levine will never win playing around with zombie rules such as the idea that the dead can turn back to the living.And the mashing up ultimately leaves a mushy aftertaste.What ""Warm Bodies""  Two stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 137  Content Zombie violence and some language Kevin C.

"Warm Bodies | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; warm-bodies ) Warm Bodies (United States 2013) January 31 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli As if it wasnt bad enough that Twilight defanged vampires turning them into whiny emo Harlequin romance heroes now Warm Bodies has done something similar for zombies. Granted that latter evisceration is more challenging than the former. After all sexuality has often been associated with vampires. But zombies? Mindless shuffling corpses that reek of rotting flesh? Warm Bodies has found a way to make them sexy. One might be willing to acknowledge the Herculean achievement if the movie wasnt so hopelessly mediocre. It wants to be funny charming scary and dramatic. It ends up being a little of each but not successful as any one. This is Dawn of the Dead meets Romeo amp; Juliet with an Army of Darkness sensibility. Admittedly that sounds like a great premise and Im sure it got everyone all lathered up in the pitch meeting. But the tone is all over the place the script is vacillates between witty and brain-dead and the PG-13 sensibility neuters anything resembling edginess. At least the lead actors are capable and engaging and theres some nice chemistry in place. But Warm Bodies left me more frustrated than satisfied because the film is content to underwhelm with fertile material and rarely attempts anything interesting. Perhaps the problem lies with the source material. I dont know; I havent read Isaac Marions novel. But either Marion wove a compelling tale that Jonathan Levines screenplay turned into mush or Levine has faithfully adapted something that was mush in the first place. I have liked some of Levines past work as a writer and director ( 50/50 The Wackness) so this counts as a disappointment. Its going for a mainstream primarily female audience whose knowledge of horror comes through YA material. As a friend put it after the screening this is ""a chick flick zombie movie."" The movie opens with R (Nicholas Hoult) a zombie shuffling around the post-apocalyptic ruins of a city. It might be a scene out of a Romero movie except that Rs voiceover is filled with pithy satirical observations. Enter Julie (Teresa Palmer) one member of a band of human scouts sent into zombie territory to retrieve medical supplies. During the encounter R chows down on the brain of Julies boyfriend Perry (Dave Franco brother of James) and absorbs his memories of their relationship. Somehow this jump-starts Rs transformation back to the land of the living. His heart begins to beat. He starts speaking words. And he protects Julie from the other zombies. Thus begins a star-crossed romance that leads not only to a balcony scene (yes - there really is one) but to a big confrontation between undead and humans with the in-between zombies choosing sides. To be fair to Warm Bodies there are some funny scenes and the romantic elements are surprisingly well handled for something that on paper sounds cringe-worthy. A plot device easily allows concerns about necrophilia to be sidestepped. The story suffers however from a lack of ambition. Its not overly concerned about the big picture beyond how it impacts the love story. The whole thing feels more like a prologue to a longer more compelling allegory about humanity and racism. It would be fascinating to revisit this society in fifteen years to see how it has evolved - a lot more fascinating that exploring its nascent beginnings here. Warm Bodies opens itself up for such criticisms because it gives out smoke signals that it wants to be more than just another horror-comedy. The problem is aside from throwing out occasional weighty ideas as parts of minor subplots it doesnt achieve much thats likely to impress with its heft insight or intelligence. The comedy isnt plentiful enough for the movie to take refuge in its jokes and the horror is lame. If theres one brand of monster that simply cant be done PG-13 its zombies. The leads are likeable enough. The application of Romeo amp; Juliet is effective because few basic romantic templates are more likely to get us rooting for hopeless love. Nicholas Hoult whose career has taken him from About a Boy to X-Men First Class to this does a nice job with the transition from shambling zombie to a socially awkward guy who bears a passing resemblance to a young Tom Cruise. Teresa Palmer is attractive and feisty but her character does just enough stupid things to suggest she might be at home in a more traditional horror movie. Oh and John Malkovich shows up to deliver a few lines scowl and pick up his paycheck. Perhaps the most depressing thing about the whole Twilight phenomenon is the impact it has had on horror in general. It may no longer be possible to tell a story about undead without grafting on some sort of romance and reducing the monster into a misunderstood societal outcast. Warm Bodies is the product of Summit Entertainment the distributor of the Twilight movies and theres little doubt the hope is to attract a fraction of Stephenie Meyers core audience. The film has its charms but the trailer suggests a level of cleverness and inventiveness that isnt evident in the full production.

Warm Bodies (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Warm Bodies (PG-13) The worlds first zombie romantic comedy proves even the undead can find a soul mate. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle cogleMiamiHerald.com1/31/2013 Editor rating 2.5 With their rotting flesh gore-soaked jaws and insatiable lust for brains -- eating them not using them -- zombies have gotten the short end of the romantic stick. They have ceded sex appeal to their hot undead cousins the vampires. No matter how many teenage boys may beg for it youre never going to see a flesh-eating corpse on the cover of a teen mag next to Justin Bieber. Until now maybe. The likable if not remarkable Warm Bodies is the worlds first romantic zombie comedy told from the point of view of a dead guy R (Nicholas Hoult of X-Men First Class and A Single Man). R has slid far enough from humanity that he cant remember his name what he did or how he died but he still hazily recalls some of the finer joys of life. He spends his days staggering around the airport with the rest of the undead trying to avoid the vicious skeletal Boneys (zombies who have surrendered any trace of humanity and are solely interested in the flesh-eating arts). R on the other hand has a friend he occasionally grunts at (Rob Corddry) and he has made himself a nice little nest in an abandoned airplane where he collects trinkets and plays records. John Waites Missing You apparently sounds a lot better when youre dead. Then one day the zombie horde is out foraging for meat and R spots Julie (Teresa Palmer of I Am Number Four) and his heart starts pumping figuratively at first then eventually literally. He falls in love with her immediately despite the fact that she would have shot him in the head had she still had ammunition. Such are the vagaries of young love. The real problem though isnt their different states of decay. Julies dad (John Malkovich) is a gung-ho zombie killer who is never going to believe that love can bring the dead back to life. Director of the severely underappreciated Joseph Gordon-Levitt/Seth Rogen film 50/50 Jonathan Levine takes a few necessary liberties with the monster mythology in particular with Rs looks. He cant be grotesque like the mindless ghouls on The Walking Dead; he has to be cute if a little veiny. Logic is mostly thrown out the window; one of the great questions for the ages regarding zombie films is whether the undead can run and Warm Bodies take on the subject is inconsistent. Zombie lore doesnt allow for redemption only head shots and Levines film amusing though it may be is never gory enough to truly become a classic zombie movie. It also ignores the one basic necessity of monster films even the funny ones It really ought to be creepy or scary or gross at least once or twice. But Warm Bodies is about connecting not severing and as such it just isnt interested in the dark side. The humor in the film ranges from gentle (R and Julie get to know each other via a musical montage of Hungry Heart) to mildly disgusting (their meet-cute happens when hes eating her boyfriends brains). Still though Warm Bodies never quite reaches the height of horror comedy -- that crown belongs to Shaun of the Dead or Zombieland take your pick -- its not a bad tale of the dangers of isolation the value of caring and how life is sweeter minus the taste of human flesh.

"Warm Bodies movie review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Warm Bodies Zombie love runs hot and cold  1/2 Warm Bodies Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer star in ""Warm Bodies."" Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer star in ""Warm Bodies."" Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune The tween-minded zombie romance ""Warm Bodies"" pulls a comic-romantic twist on a genre better known for its entrails. It is narrated by the undead fellow known as R played by Nicholas Hoult soon to be slaying giants in ""Jack the Giant Slayer.""The voice-over narration confirms our heros sensitive side. ""I just want to connect"" he tells us accompanying footage of R stumbling around an abandoned airport on an ordinary undead day among his fellow zombies in a post-apocalyptic landscape. R covets his long-playing records (actual vinyl) and like the title character in ""Wall-E"" hes a collector and a nostalgist by nature. All he needs is love. The film written and directed by Jonathan Levine comes from Isaac Marions novel and its rules of zombie life and lifelessness are pretty clear. By eating human brains zombies can experience that victims memories. More pertinent to the narrative which riffs on ""Romeo and Juliet"" to the point of including a balcony scene in ""Warm Bodies"" the zombie state is not permanent. Its reversible. If youre in love with a young woman (Teresa Palmer) who is not yet dead this is promising news.Palmers character Julie is the overprotected daughter of General Grigio leader of the movement to keep the zombies at bay on the other side of the quarantine wall. (Whats up with that character name? Is he a crew chief at Trader Joes?) Julie and R have their own little ""meet-cute"" according to rom-com requirements While hunting for zombies with her boyfriend and some other pretty people Julie is saved from being eaten by R. The pale young mans heartstrings go zing when he spies her lovely loveliness. Her dawning interest in decaying nerds with poetry in their souls sparks a revolution. Were a long way from the manic repulsive jolly slapstick of ""Zombieland."" This is more like a sensitively bent version of a Nicholas Sparks novel where lovers must overcome significant social obstacles before moving on to the bed. At one point we hear R remind himself ""Dont be creepy ... dont be creepy"" as he tries to pass for human among actual humans. Hoult has a nice sympathetic quality at such moments though the whole of ""Warm Bodies"" in both its comic and dramatic strains lacks a certain ... what? Ooomph? Intensity? Invention?Levine has a strong instinct as a packager of moments ladling on the alt-rock just so before ladling on another ladles worth. So far hes proven himself wildly uneven careening from the smugness of ""The Wackness"" to the heartening success of ""50/50."" ""Warm Bodies"" lands somewhere between the two. Rob Corddry as one of Rs undead pals quietly steals the show in his first wholly effective screen turn. Usually Corddry gives audiences too much playing the boor. Here he may be zombiefied but he warms to the underplaying opportunity at hand.mjphillipstribune.comWarm Bodies -- 2 1/2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for zombie violence and some language)Running time 137Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Ghouls and Zombies (supernatural entities) Entertainment Movies Warm Bodies (movie) Rob Corddry Wall-E (movie) The Wackness (movie) Michael Phillips predicts the Oscars 10 movies to see this winter Top 50 superhero movies of the last 10 years Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising76deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0129-warm-bodies-20130131,0,7725182.column",200,warmbodies33,warmbodies,chicagotribune

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Isaac Marions 2011 zombie romance novel Warm Bodies ends with a splashy mildly ridiculous event that ties its themes together and makes its underlying zombie metaphor clear. In a way Marion isnt talking about diseased undead creatures who consume brains; hes talking about people in general and how they sleepwalk through life or give in to despair becoming zombies in a less literal sense. (Shaun Of The Dead got across the same point in two quick paired shots noting how little difference Simon Pegg sees in his average morning when everyone around him becomes a shuffling corpse but thats beside the point.) The film adaptation cuts that climactic event; possibly writer-director Jonathan Levine correctly intuited that it would be harder to swallow onscreen. But the film adds in nothing to replace it which makes the climax toothless and limp. And the adaptation takes its premise painfully literally resulting in a series of unlikely developments guaranteed to get hardcore zombie-movie fans frothing with rage--if they dont doze off first. The film starts out wry and clever with Nicholas Hoult (also star of the upcoming Jack The Giant Slayer but formerly the boy in About A Boy) mentally monologuing about what its like to be a zombie dragging around an airport with his fellow monsters wondering whether theres more to unlife. For a lively sharply observed few minutes Warm Bodies mocks its genre and modern society at the same time. But then Hoult falls for a human (Teresa Palmer) the daughter of a grim general (John Malkovich underused and undercommitted) who oversees what may be the last outpost of human survivors. Hoult rescues Palmer from his fellow zombies and confines her in his airport home where he secrets her away from the rest of his kind. As the two begin a tentative Stockholm swooning relationship his romantic obsession with her counteracts his mental lethargy and he starts speaking again gradually becoming less of a monster and more of a person. (Morbidly he helps his crush along by chewing on some pocketed fragments of brain from his last human kill--Palmers boyfriend Dave Franco whose precious memories of time spent with Palmer inspire Hoult.) Dimly inspired by the idea of something new and meaningful happening in their lives some of Hoults fellow zombies--including his best friend Rob Corddry--move to support him but then another breed of desiccated skeletal zombies step up to try to wipe out humanity and end this whole magical love thing before it becomes a movement. On paper in Marions hands much of this story was about the protagonists internal life in a way that turned him into a colorfully realized version of an every-teen awkward at expressing himself occasionally horrified at the gap between his feelings and his actions uncertain where each new development might lead but excited by every new hint of hope and of escape from the dreary mundane daily plod. Onscreen its a mildly comedic but bluntly told story about how teen romance magically cures zombie infection. Armchair critics have been comparing the film sight unseen to Twilight for its supernatural central pairing but in execution its far more like a twee low-key passive teen romance along the lines of Nick And Noras Infinite Playlist or Levines own 2008 film The Wackness. Its major resemblance to Twilight is in the way it waters down a perfectly good monster into a broody ineffectual boy then presents that boy as the apotheosis of romance. While it takes some of its premise (and the protagonists names) from Romeo And Juliet it lacks that plays passion and sense of burning need. For a movie about a love so powerful that it brings people back from the dead its curiously tepid. In spite of its repeated overwrought image of grey dead zombie hearts flushing and throbbing with new life it lacks a beating heart of its own.

An inspired mashup of zombie heart and romantic-comedy brains ""Warm Bodies"" offers a welcome twist on the living-dead canon even if the decidedly femme-skewed results ignore pretty much every rule of the genre. Hoping to do for flesh-eaters what ""The Twilight Saga"" did for vampires albeit on a smaller scale writer-director Jonathan Levine spins Isaac Marions novel into a broadly appealing date movie about a zombified Romeo and his lively Juliet. As played by Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer the couple carries a love story with more laughs than scares and should breathe fresh life into the Valentines Day frame. Although most of the teenage target audience for this hot-blooded romance will be too young to remember for decades zombies were the bottom-feeders of the horror world. Now thanks to AMCs ""The Walking Dead"" and other popular reinterpretations they seem to be all the rage giving ""Warm Bodies"" a chance to evolve things further. Marions concept revises classic zombie lore in which an irreversible infection transforms carefree humans into cannibalistic corpses. Here the change might not be permanent although a contingent of well-armed survivors led by Gen. Grigio (John Malkovich in taskmaster mode) dont know that walling themselves off in a dilapidated city for protection from the slow-moving undead and their more aggressive counterparts called Bonies. But as Miracle Max might say theres a big difference between mostly dead and all dead and Hoults character -- who calls himself ""R"" since thats all he can remember of his name -- still has at least half a brain as evidenced by his zingy self-aware narration. On his new appetite for anything with a heartbeat he shrugs ""At least Im conflicted."" Shuffling about an abandoned airport with pale skin dark eye makeup and a grubby red hoodie R could pass for a disaffected college dropout. Indeed Marions novel suggests that apathy rather than a virus was responsible for the zombie outbreak and the film charmingly embraces the idea that romance could be enough to shake people back to life. One day R grunt-buddy M (Rob Corddry) and a group of hungry zombies venture out in search of food and stumble across a group of humans led by Julie (Palmer) and her half-psycho b.f. Perry (Dave Franco). When the two parties meet a bloodbath ensues. In the process of killing Perry R spies Julie blasting away his cohorts and something in him stirs. Smitten R leads Julie back to his sanctum -- an abandoned airplane where he collects trinkets from his various raids including a record collection that fuels the amusing song-filled soundtrack which asks auds to reinterpret old lyrics giving new meaning to John Waites ""Missing You"" and Bruce Springsteens ""Hungry Heart."" Channeling the awkwardness of young love R struggles to express himself to his captive while Julie comes to realize that maybe the humans have the wrong idea about the zombies who are slowly coming back to life -- in a good way. Conveniently for R Julie seems unfazed by Perrys quite-permanent death and as they hang out his vocabulary relaxes to the point that they can communicate. It helps that by the films rules ingesting brains allows zombies to absorb their victims memories which affords R glimpses into happier pre-apocalyptic times whenever he noshes on pieces of Perry. Since the story sees no reason the two lovers should not be joined the only challenge that remains is convincing humans and zombies to join forces against those nasty Bonies -- badly rendered mo-cap skeletons that are not up to the pics otherwise impressive production values. Though the visual effects sometimes disappoint the crew achieves scope via aerial photography and ideal Montreal locations. The pic keeps the horror quotient in check while focusing on the femme-friendly comedy and romance angles offsetting the plentiful moments of suspense with cutesy scenes like the one in which Julies best friend (Analeigh Tipton) gives R a human makeover. Even at the outset R doesnt appear too frightening and the more time he spends around humans the less dead he looks. For purists nearly every aspect of ""Warm Bodies"" defies the guidelines established by zombie godfather George A. Romero. If the walking dead always found it this easy to go vegan the genre would fade away in a heartbeat and yet ""Warm Bodies"" still embraces its rich allegorical potential to lighter effect treating the last act for instance as a ""Guess Whos Coming to Dinner""-like farce.

TWITTER The zom-rom-com arrives with Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer as the star-crossed duo in a lighthearted postapocalyptic spin on Romeo and Juliet. Warm Bodies the latest permutation of the zombie screen phenomenon places heart over horror and romantic teen angst over sharp social commentary. The low gore quotient and emphasis on young love might disappoint genre purists but for those open to the idea of a gently goofy mash-up the film is strong on atmosphere and offers likably low-key if somewhat bland charms. As a date movie for teens and twentysomethings that nods toward edgy fantasy while favoring down-to-earth mellowness the Summit release is primed to hit the box-office sweet spot. Working from Isaac Marions young-adult novel writer-director Jonathan Levine has devised a feature thats his highest-concept production to date yet still somehow his least contrived. His affinity for low-key male coming-of-age stories demonstrated in The Wackness and 50/50 lends itself to the saga of an undead sensitive guy who falls for a real-live girl. PHOTOS Cinema With Brains Hollywoods 12 Best Zombie Flicks The storys dystopian versions of Romeo and Juliet are Nicholas Hoults R -- he cant remember his full name or anything else about his pre-apocalypse existence -- and Teresa Palmers Julie whose meet-cute involves a shoot-em-up that ends badly for Julies duty-bound boyfriend (Dave Franco). As Rs voice-over narration explains its been eight years since an unspecified plague devastated humankind. Corpses as the slacker-ish zombies are called and of which hes one feed on whats left of the living. A more extreme mutation called Boneys -- skeletal creatures that are an effective but not quite menacing combination of stunt work and CGI -- will eat anything including corpses. The gore is suggested rather than explicit mostly via the blood-smeared lips of R whos given to snacking on brains. Its a form of nourishment that gives him access to the deads memories presented in scenes that fill in backstory but dont entirely make sense in terms of p.o.v. Julie helps to defend the humans walled-off Green Zone as a member of the militia organized by her widowed father (John Malkovich a compellingly single-minded authority figure). She winds up on the other side of the wall after a smitten R saves her from his fellow corpses and spirits her back to his home base an abandoned airport thats key among the movies superb Montreal locations. In the jet that R has turned into a collectors paradise of retro tchotchkes vintage vinyl and working turntable the two stare at each other and try to converse with Rs vocabulary of grunts gradually giving way to the language hed almost forgotten. Before long theyre grooving to album cuts like Springsteens ""Hungry Heart"" and Dylans ""Shelter From the Storm"" -- songs that are no less enjoyable here for being transparently on-the-nose. Theres an exuberant sweetness to the materials nostalgic slant that goes beyond thrift-shop memorabilia binding millennial yearning to boomer pop-culture soulfulness. VIDEO Warm Bodies First Four Minutes of Summits Zombie Rom-Com Hits Web The portrait of adolescent alienation touches glancingly on degrees of conformity but Levine has no interest in crossing into the political-allegory territory of George Romeros zombie classics. Here the ennui sometimes seeps into the narrative in a way that leaves stretches of the movie enervated and galumphing like a corpse. As far as the latter goes Hoults shuffling zombie perambulation is particularly good as is his facial expressiveness in scenes where R is essentially preverbal. The British actor who made his name as a kid in About a Boy and soon will topline Bryan Singers Jack the Giant Slayer is charismatic as a guy whose first love proves truly transformative. He and Aussie Palmer handle their dialogue with believable American accents zombie inflection included. Her Julie is a good match for R at once warrior-tough and openhearted. As their respective best friends Rob Corddry and Analeigh Tipton are well cast the former providing a suitably inscrutable take on Mercutio and Tipton upping the films comic buoyancy. Cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe (whose credits include Vicky Cristina Barcelona The Others and two Twilight features) uses widescreen long shots and a blue-gray palette to heighten the wasteland feel. From newspaper headlines to street art by Shepard Fairey Martin Whists production design is a frozen-in-time cityscape waiting to be thawed. But when the central characters love jump-starts that thawing the movie grows less evocative and more heavy-handed pounding home its theme of engagement over passivity to the brink of Hollywood malarkey. Flavorful song choices aside the music score likewise veers toward the sentimental. At its best Warm Bodies paints a dead zones slow awakening with gloomy giddiness brimming with visual humor.
