Comments Final Fantasy The Spirits Within Based on the digital game created by director Hironobu Sakaguchi this photorealistically animated postapocalyptic scenario builds on a theory shared by two of its remaining humans--Dr. Aki Ross and her mentor. They believe that all life-forms are characterized by signature spiritual waves and theyre determined to persuade an impatient general that an invasion by alien phantoms can be repelled peacefully if Dr. Ross can quickly isolate all eight spiritual wave forms; one belongs to a plant--a rare find in the barren crumbling New York City so popular in science fiction. I never stopped marveling at the thousands of individually delineated pores and hair strands of the heroine but the thin story covering her acquisition of one wave after another while narrowly escaping death time and again is strictly for player one. Written by Al Reinert and Jeff Vintar; with the voices of Ming-na Donald Sutherland Alec Baldwin James Woods Ving Rhames Peri Gilpin and Steve Buscemi. 105 min.

This bigscreen adaptation of the long-popular interactive computer game is visually impressive if not dramatically cool and is marked by ""acting"" that is no worse than that found in the majority of sci-fi films. As computer game-derived features go it sure beats ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider."" If the studios had needed a secret weapon during the recent contract negotiations with the Screen Actors Guild they could have used ""Final Fantasy The Spirits Within."" The first major release to feature an entire cast of computer-generated human characters this bigscreen adaptation of the long-popular interactive computer game is visually impressive if not dramatically cool and is marked by ""acting"" that is no worse than that found in the majority of sci-fi films. Teens especially game players and boys already turned on to the beautiful virtual heroine Dr. Aki Ross will constitute a hefty opening-weekend audience for this sleek but distant entertainment although how much repeat biz or curiosity among non-aficionados it will generate is questionable. But as computer game-derived features go it sure beats ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider."" Foreign future especially in Asia look big as does home viewing revenue down the line. The ""Final Fantasy"" game first appeared in 1987 and reached a crescendo of popularity with the release of the eighth and ninth installments over the past two years. Creator Hironobu Sakaguchi has controlled the game every step of the way and maintained a total grip on the film as well in his capacities as story writer producer and director (co-director Motonori Sakakibara has worked with him as an animator and director since 1995). Al Reinert who co-wrote the script with Jeff Vintar was born in Japan and more than earned his space-travel stripes as producer-director of the docu ""For All Mankind"" and co-writer of ""Apollo 13."" Although it treads such familiar movie and sci-fi territory as a decimated planet Earth (New York City takes it on the chin again) aliens that can get up inside you and intense battles in which a few stalwart humans try to keep the savage hordes at bay pic is marked by an Eastern one-world spiritual and philosophical approach quite different from the gung-ho action mentality found in most Western futuristic epics. In tone and attitude ""Final Fantasy"" is much closer to the modern Japanese animated classic ""Princess Mononoke"" which dealt with disruptions in the overarching harmoniousness of the natural world order than to the kick-butt mindset one normally expects in the computer game arena. On the other hand all the highfalutin talk about wave theory spirit signatures dream visions and energy forces -- much of it from the mouth of a resident bald sage -- will more readily remind many viewers of ""Star Trek"" which is both a good and a bad thing. The phantoms -- opaque dragon-like creatures that appear float about and vanish like ghosts -- that represent the ostensible evil here arent particularly effective villains so there is a fundamental lack of visceral engagement in the central conflict. Film boasts enough action and incident to hold the attention over the relatively brisk running time but its a calm polite sort of attention one without compelling involvement or resonance. Curiously then for a film thats both animated and a sci-fier most of the interest stems from the appeal of its principal character. A cool composed dark-haired beauty who resembles a blend of Jennifer Love Hewitt and Bridget Fonda Dr. Aki Ross is introduced on an exploratory mission to Old New York City in 2065. In terms of narrative which involves Aki and some friendly soldiers shooting at elusive light forms in the ruined streets of the city and later being scanned for contagion initial action is fairly confusing. But this doesnt matter much since one is absorbed during the opening stretch simply beholding the physical look of this new artistic universe. Style is dubbed ""hyperRealism"" by its makers a term that seems as good as any since it very narrowly walks the line between photographic realism and ultra-vivid painterly detail; backgrounds are close to the sort of lifelike representations of otherworldly settings that have graced the covers of sci-fi novels over the years. Same can be said of the characters. In what will prove most threatening to flesh-and-blood actors the virtual figures here are sufficiently real-looking to evoke virtually emotional (and virtually erotic) responses. It would seem that computer animators have cleared the major hurdles in the way of creating wholly credible human characters and now are in the home stretch toward achieving it. More than any feature film that has appeared to date this one makes one ponder the uneasy question of how replaceable actors may be -- and how soon -- in dramatic material. This is hardly to make any claims for the emoting done by the computer drawings herein which are no more emotionally expressive than animated characters have been over the decades. But it must also be acknowledged that Aki has far more palpable impact than a normal cartoon character both because of her demure seemingly unconscious sexiness and her unusual degree of intelligence spirituality and focus. As an object of appeal and admiration and as a role model she rates very high even if she was created in a computer on Waikiki Beach. Once the storyline emerges from the shadows it has something to do with the crisis among humans as to how to fight the aliens. The military repped by the determined General Hein (voiced by James Woods) naturally wants to blast them back to wherever they came from with his all-powerful Zeus Cannon. Although Hein is restrained by a reason-seeking Council there isnt much time which puts heavy pressure on the already infected Aki (smartly voiced by Ming-Na who previously did the vocal honors for Mulan) and her egg-headed mentor Dr. Sid (Donald Sutherland) to find the eight spirits that combined will create an energy wave to offset the predatory force repped by the spectral aliens. Since the ghostly monsters are too pale and ephemeral to be truly scary some more vivid adversaries are introduced in nightmare visions Aki has courtesy of her alien infection. But the Eastern p.o.v. is pronounced and even the presence of Yank-speaking-and-looking characters isnt enough to prevent this from feeling more like a Japanese film than an American one. A potential romance between Aki and her crews captain (Alec Baldwin) is nipped in the bud but the captain will have his own impact on young femme viewers as hes been sculpted from the hardest brave-and-buff stone. Voicing is solid down the line and pic evinces a craftsmanlike fastidiousness throughout all levels of production.

Ltd; Release Date Limited 07/11/2001; Runtime (in minutes) 106; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Columbia Pictures Posted July 12 2001 -- 1200 AM EDT You can look at Final Fantasy The Spirits Within as an apocalyptic showdown between good guys on the side of spirituality versus bad guys on the side of the Strategic Defense Initiative. You can follow this computer generated sci-fi movie produced and directed by Hironobu Sakaguchi and inspired by the Japanese creators popular Final Fantasy videogame as a conventional romantic adventure on the ""Star Wars"" model involving a wise old man a brave woman a fearless man and the fate of the earth. And youd be wasting time better spent just ogling this gorgeous curiosity. The story is merely average by sci-fi standards; the spiritual/ ecological message verges on gooey. But ""Final Fantasy"" is also a mesmerizing technical achievement and a breakthrough in the synergy - to borrow that corporate cliche - between digital gaming and moviegoing. Untethered from the conventions of human emotion based storytelling these computer created characters represent a cinematic art of the future taking its first baby steps today. Those steps open possibilities human actors might well worry about since the performers playing the earthlings in this fable will never threaten a SAG strike. True their voices are contributed by established dues payers including Ming-Na (as the heroine Aki Ross) Alec Baldwin (as her rugged love match) Donald Sutherland (as Dr. Sid a Yoda stand-in) Steve Buscemi and Peri Gilpin. But can it be long before synthesized voices do that work too? Besides what is lost in the transference that traditionally connects moviegoers to ""real"" actors is made up for in the glory of the imagery created by Sakaguchi and his team. The texture of skin and hair the play of light on form is astounding - and matched by big picture moments of exquisite psychedelic complexity. ""Final Fantasy"" may not tell a great story but its a great wow.

Or at least a low-key response even though the expensive screen version of Hironobu Sakaguchis popular video games is a visual marvel. But moviegoers accustomed to Hollywood action probably wont find this contemplative adventure so appealing. The army battling floating phantoms in 2065 are the most realistic-looking computer-generated humans the movies have given us which foreshadows an only mildly compelling story.

And a take-no-prisoners military (headed by James Woods) is battling scientists about how to best defeat the phantoms which are killing and in some cases invading the bodies of victims. Will the scientists win out with their more benign approach? Weve seen it before in 50s sci-fi but the creatures are much cooler here. When curvy Dr. Aki Ross (voice of Ming-Na of Mulan and TVs ER) and hunky Capt. Gray Edwards (Alec Baldwin) share a kiss late in the film Fantasy becomes one of the few movies since 1972s X-rated Fritz the Cat that makes you consider the sex life of animated characters. Thats a noteworthy footnote but not enough to make a movie -- even when good actors from Donald Sutherland to Ving Rhames to Steve Buscemi are supplying the voices. With the exception of Sutherland the emotional kick wouldnt be much stronger were it populated with people. And despite a pall over action scenes this is a better game spinoff than Lara Croft Tomb Raider. If nothing else its amusing to hear familiar voices especially Buscemis coming from non-humans bearing no resemblance to the actors. But alas Buscemi doesnt get the girl even in animation.

"Final Fantasy | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; final-fantasy ) Final Fantasy (Japan/United States 2001) A movie review by James Berardinelli Computer gaming fans have two reasons to rejoice during the summer of 2001 Tomb Raider and Final Fantasy The Spirits Within. However although both are based on best-selling software the approach taken by the filmmakers (Simon West for Tomb Raider; Hironobu Sakaguchi for Final Fantasy) are divergent. While Tomb Raider is a live-action Raiders of the Lost Ark-style action/adventure movie Final Fantasy is a computer animated science fiction action film that borrows heavily from Aliens and Star Trek. The result despite lacking in originality is fast-paced and highly watchable. The year is 2065. Earth is a battle zone with pockets of humanity hiding behind barriers in megalithic cities from the ""phantoms"" alien invaders which have the capability of sucking the life force out of human beings. The war has raged since the arrival of the aliens in the Caspian Mountains and all human settlements outside of the barriers have been laid waste. Dr. Aki Ross (voice of Ming-Na) an intrepid scientist and protA(c)gA"" of the revered Dr. Sid (Donald Sutherland) is ""collecting"" the 8 ""spirits"" that when combined will generate an energy wave to neutralize the aliens. She is aided by a small commando team comprised of Captain Gray Edwards (Alec Baldwin) Neal Fleming (Steve Buscemi) Jane Proudfoot (Peri Gilpin) and Ryan Whittaker (Ving Rhames). While the council governing Earth backs Aki and Dr. Sids plan the ruthless and influential head of the military General Hein (James Woods) advocates a more violent solution - using the Zeus cannon to obliterate the aliens possibly damaging the Earth as well. It becomes a race against time with Aki and her group trying to collect all the spirits before General Hein unleashes the power of the Zeus cannon. The aspect of Final Fantasy that will receive the most attention is neither the storyline nor the films close kinship to anime nor its roots in the gaming world. Rather its the movies look or to be more precise its attempts to realize computer-generated synthetic actors as replacements for flesh-and-blood thespians. This is of course not the first time humans have appeared in a computer animated motion picture (one needs search no further than Shrek to find examples) but it is the first time an attempt has been made to accurately mimic the human form with all of its subtle characteristics. So is it possible to tell that the individuals in Final Fantasy are animated or do they look so real that they can be mistaken for actors? In medium and long shots especially when the lighting is dim the computer creations are extremely convincing. Their overall appearance and movement mimes that of any human. Up close however no one would confuse these creations with real people. There are all sorts of minor glitches that betray them as animated (fingers in particular seem to be a problem - theyre too long and slender). Dont misunderstand - what the creators of Final Fantasy have done is impressive and its leaps and bounds beyond anything previously accomplished (even in Shrek) but theres room for improvement. One issue that Final Fantasy raises about computer generated people is whether its a good idea to employ bankable stars as their voices. In Final Fantasy a combination of well-known vocal talents (Alec Baldwin James Woods Donald Sutherland) and lesser-known individuals (Ming-Na Peri Gilpin) are used. While Ming-Na may be familiar to viewers of ""E.R."" her voice does not immediately conjure an image of her face. As a result Aki comes across as a fully-realized character with the voice wedded to the image. That is not the case for Alec Baldwins Gray. We know Baldwins voice but Gray looks more like George Clooney than Baldwin and this creates a disconnect. After all were hearing Baldwins voice but not seeing his features. Similar problems arise with the characters voiced by Woods and Sutherland and to a lesser extent Ving Rhames and Steve Buscemi. Until now this has not been an issue but this is the first time viewers are being presented with animated humans that look close to the real thing. Its one thing for Eddie Murphy to provide the voice of a jackass; its another for Donald Sutherland to lend his vocal abilities to someone who looks like a cross between Donald Pleasence and Fu Manchu. In the future the best approach might be to use relatively unknown voices (like Ming-Nas) in movies such as this. All of that aside Final Fantasy is a rousing science fiction adventure that contains enough action to keep the average viewer engaged. It pilfers shamelessly from other movies but thats not necessarily a problem since very little in the science fiction universe can claim to be original these days. The commando groups battles with the phantoms are reminiscent of the space marines encounters with the creatures in Aliens. The idea of an all-encompassing life force sounds suspiciously like something from Star Wars (not that it was new then but thats what most contemporary viewers will associate it with). And the films ending bears more than a passing resemblance to the way Star Trek The Motion Picture concluded 22 years ago. Visually the film is stunning and its not hard to understand the obvious advantages of doing this kind of project in the animated arena. (Although with todays technology it could have been done with real actors inserted into all of this imaginative computer derived scenery.) The action sequences whether in outer space (where the Zeus cannon waits to unleash its deadly fire power) or in the ruins of ""Old New York City"" are smoothly spectacularly rendered. There are some complex camera angles such as when Aki views the devastation of a planet in her dreams or when we look up at her from under the water. Even as recently as ten years ago a film with this much scope and imagination would have been financially and technically unfeasible. (Its still expensive reportedly costing about 140 million.) Final Fantasy is more story-centered than any of its game-based predecessors. The characters despite their digital origins are developed with enough care to meet the needs of the screenplay and to forge a rudimentary bond with the audience. Pacing is also important; Final Fantasy moves quickly enough that some of the less interesting script elements dont bog the picture down. Its also worth noting that Final Fantasy doesnt seem like it was based on a computer game. It has the kind of dramatic structure one might expect from a more ""classic"" motion picture. Final Fantasy gives audiences a chance to glimpse the future of action/adventure/science fiction movies. With a more cutting-edge script and better-realized characters theres no reason why this kind of motion picture cannot be as satisfying and fulfilling as any live action endeavor. Final Fantasy is an excellent first step and a fine entertainment experience in its own right but its true achievement is to open a window onto the next frontier for computer animation.

Like Lara Croft Aki goes into this summers film version with a built-in audience of gamers. In this dystopian fantasy of the near future ""Old New York City"" is a high- rise ruin most of Earth is a wasteland and only a few humans remain. One of them is Aki. Think about it. Is this some kind of sick joke or at least an in- joke? A virtual human plays one of the few real humans left. There is no convincing reason to believe that the human race will continue to survive. A similar idea was what caught the imagination of tough-minded Stanley Kubrick in ""A.I."" before tender- minded Steven Spielberg got his hands on it. In ""Final Fantasy The Spirits Within"" Earth has been invaded by aliens who infect humans like a virus. The early manifestations that we see look like transparent specimens on a microscope slide. Theres more than one good reason to take the real-life Angelina Jolie over the virtual Aki any time. For one thing in ""Tomb Raider"" Jolie showed us she could wrap those lips around an English accent. Sakaguchi apparently has not come up with a way to create virtual voices and thus was forced to hire real actors. This summer Alec Baldwins voice is everywhere. Its attached to his real body in ""Pearl Harbor."" In ""Cats amp; Dogs"" it comes out of a German shepherd called Butch. Here its the patrol captain Gray Edwards who has a history with Aki but probably no future. We hear Baldwins voice before we see him and when Capt. Edwards removes his helmet we half expect to see Baldwin and are a little disappointed we dont. This virtual-reality role curiously is a little like the real character Baldwin plays in ""Pearl Harbor"" Lt. Col. Jimmy Doolittle Both go on suicide missions. Aki whose voice is provided by Ming-Na (""The Joy Luck Club"") is everything a millennial female protagonist must be smart effective plain in a beautiful way spiritual but with a fatal flaw which she handles bravely. All this is admirable but tends to be lugubrious. ""Final Fantasy"" is nothing if not a sincere production -- the motto ""The Spirits Within"" is no mere catchphrase. The rest of the vocal lineup is impressive in exact proportion to the characters they play. Donald Sutherland for instance is tiresome as the tiresome old Dr. Sid who periodically must unload tons of gobbledygook exposition and keep the audience up to date. Peri Gilpin of ""Frasier"" on the other hand is refreshing as Jane in what I came to think of as the gutsy Carrie-Anne Moss role. The look of the film varies in impressive ways. Scenes of the post- apocalyptic Earth are monotone grays dark blues and browns. They are interrupted by Akis dreams surrealistic landscapes invaded by loping clanking creatures. Most impressive of all are the close-ups of the faces sometimes radiantly lit frequently wan. Virtual characters have already appeared in mainstream films -- remember Jar Jar Binks in ""Star Wars Episode 1 -- The Phantom Menace""? Here ordinary movement of the characters around a chamber becomes a matter of extraordinary fascination. Nonetheless these virtual characters look more like human robots than Haley Joel Osment does in ""A.I."" While the look of the film is state of the art the dramaturgy can sometimes be resoundingly old-fashioned straight out of 40s war films but with no saving hint of self-awareness. There even is a noble wounded soldier who insists on being left behind. The demonstration of the photo-realism technique is impressive but sooner or later viewers have to ask themselves If they were to do this film with live actors would it be worth seeing? Visually this is one of the most fascinating films of the summer; that does not mean its one of the most involving. ""Final Fantasy"" taking its Earth-is-alive philosophy on its own terms has its moments. Akis dreams are a link to the phantom world of the aliens. There is a touching moment when certain unexpected spirits are revealed as lost confused and angry. The soul on several occasions is seen leaving the body. The soul is blue. The photo-realism of the humans doesnt always work and frankly that is a relief. Its a weird kind of litmus test If the illusion always worked how would we know they werent really human actors and some joker had just told us they were computer generated? They could drop Ben Affleck into this film and no one would know the difference.
