Their heads are oozing with arcane audio knowledge; they are obsessive they are compulsive they are snobs.And they are capable of relating - no compelled to relate - their disaster-strewn lives with the words and melodies etched in the grooves of the black vinyl (and picture discs) they so maniacally hoard. Rob in fact having just been jettisoned by the smart beautiful Laura (Danish actress Iben Hjejle - pronounced EE-ben YIGH-la impress your friends) has rearranged his extensive record collection not alphabetically nor by category but chronologically - the Elvis Costello album he bought at the time he was going out with . . . and so on.Cusack who addresses the camera (a device that takes a little getting used to) and quotes big chunks of verbatim Hornby in the process cuts just the right figure here a 30ish brooder whose narcissism isnt exactly likable but whose ready acknowledgment of his flaws and woeful self-centeredness is. However pathetically it may come across the guy is trying to better himself. Thinking that by examining his past rejections hell come to an understanding about his present one Rob flashes back on the Top 5 breakups in his own sorry history allowing us to meet a wacked-out Lili Taylor a bitter beautiful Joelle Carter and an amusingly sultry Catherine Zeta-Jones.High Fidelity - which was scripted by Cusack and his Grosse Point Blank writing team of D.V. DeVincentis and Steve Pink (along with a credit to Scott Rosenberg) - is buoyed along by an artfully apt soundtrack (everything from Thirteenth Floor Elevators to the Velvet Underground Stiff Little Fingers to Stereolab Queen to Katrina and the Waves) and some playful cameo turns by the likes of Tim Robbins (as a ponytailed New Age-aphorism-spouting hipster) Natasha Gregson Wagner (a rock journalist) and Bruce Springsteen (as himself offering advice for the lovelorn). Deploying a meteorological metaphor Frears films Cusack walking around Chicagos cinegenic precincts in the wet and rain The weather outside is frightful just like the weather inside his head.High Fidelity with its knowing take on men messed-up romance and music is like one long hook-filled pop song for the eyes.Steven Reas e-mail address is sreaphillynews.comHIGH FIDELITY    1/2 Produced by Tim Bevan and Rudd Simmons; directed by Stephen Frears; written by D.V.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet One of the frustrating things about the onslaught of enormously popular self-consciously ""male"" cultural products--from Limp Bizkit and Korn to Maxim to The Man Show--is that their view of masculinity is monumentally reductive and condescending. Theres obviously more to being a man than drinking beer leering at women and breaking stuff and one of the wonderful things about the Stephen Frears-directed High Fidelity is that it offers a sensitive probing mature take on the inner workings of the male psyche at a time when much of popular culture has adopted a much simpler masculine ideal. Co-writer and co-producer John Cusack stars as a Chicago record-store owner; hes such a musical obsessive that music doesnt provide a soundtrack to his life so much as life informs his appreciation and understanding of music. As High Fidelity opens his latest girlfriend (Iben Hjejle) has just dumped him and the rest of the film chronicles his attempts to make sense of his romantic past and its enduring legacy. In the aftermath of Pulp Fiction pop-culture references have become an obnoxious film cliche but one of many great things about High Fidelity (adapted from Nick Hornbys terrific book) is that it understands the psychological importance music plays in its protagonists life. Cusacks compulsive habit of compiling countless musical lists closely parallels his desire to understand his present romantic situation by endlessly rehashing and analyzing his romantic past but the key difference is that his obsession with music gives him a safe place free from the anxiety and uncertainty that defines his life. A film pragmatic enough to concede that almost every relationship is doomed but romantic enough to realize that its worth it to carry on in spite of that fact High Fidelity is one of the smartest and funniest romantic comedies of the past few years. Normally an actor writing or co-writing his own movies is an ego-fueled recipe for disaster (Major Payne The Razors Edge) but with High Fidelity and Grosse Pointe Blank Cusack has helped create two of the finest Cusack vehicles since Say Anything.

Get immediate access to this article for just 1 a week by subscribing now. THE CURRENT CINEMA reviews of ""High Fidelity"" and ""The Filth and the Fury""... Nick Hornbys best-selling novel of the same name... was stuffed with the desiccated details of English life which had to get dumped in the move to Chicago; yet the transplant is ominously smooth suggesting that useless young men worrying about the minutely ripped inner sleeve of their third-favorite Aretha Franklin album are the same wherever you go... [Director Stephen] Frears and his production designer Therese DePrez seem to have forced the issue here. The apartment is painted in dark muddy-metal tones and outside the skies cloud over in sympathy. Of the citys wind there is little sign; I know that the humor of ""High Fidelity"" is shrugging and shrewd--allergic to any contentment longer than ""Lets Get It On"" by Marvin Gaye--but did it really have to be backed by such Biblical broadsides of rain? Poor [John] Cusack stomps through most of the film with his jacket over his head; true he gets to have sex in a car but only after vaulting a picket fence and lying down in a flower bed during a storm. I guess thats the moral art is Gaye but life is a tape loop of Michael Bolton songs and it will finally wear you down. When happiness does arrive in this movie it has the air not of something that you reach like your top speed but of something that you give in to like baldness or old age... ""High Fidelity"" has fun going nowhere in particular; in short its more like a dance than a book... To make one documentary about the Sex Pistols may be regarded as youthful indiscretion. To make two is asking for trouble. Nonetheless Julien Temple who made ""The Great Rock n Roll Swindle"" in 1979 has returned to the scene of the crime. ""The Filth and the Fury"" is one more trawl through the teeming trash cans of little Johnny Rotten and his friends. You will be relieved to learn that they have lost none of their capacity to be foul mostly to one another; their capacity to shock on the other hand now looks like a touching period detail and even that is dented by the revelation that the late Sid Vicious was named after a pet hamster. This highly principled rodent bit him one day ""when he was trying to be sweet to it."" I was still staggering under this news when Temple switched to footage of a benefit concert at which the band larks around with children and admires a cake that has the words ""Sex Pistols"" inscribed on it in pink icing. So much for the collapse of Western culture... View Article Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Not boiler-room warriors Maxim thumb-suckers or the denizens of West Hollywood but regular-Joe straight guys who having arrived in their mid-30s are still having a tough time getting keeping and maybe even wanting all the adult stuff guys of that demographic are meant to have an apartment that doesnt look like an abandoned bomb shelter a post-college wardrobe and crucially a woman who can see past the milk-crate shelving white tube socks and quivering ambivalence. Based on the popular novel by British author Nick Hornby the film is narrated by a record-shop owner named Rob Gordon (Cusack) whose agonizingly impeccable taste in music hasnt translated into much discrimination about life in the real world especially when it comes to women. In the book Rob is English like Hornby; in the movie hes from Cusacks hometown Chicago. As in the book the film begins with Robs ""desert-island all-time top-five most memorable split-ups"" beginning with the schoolgirl who broke his heart and ending reluctantly with the woman Laura (Iben Hjejle) whos just walked out the door. The gist of the film is that Rob is a guy who can commit over and over and over again; the joke is that hes also inevitably the one who gets dumped. High Fidelity is a romantic comedy but because its about a guy it tries to pretend it isnt. Mostly it tries to come off as something else -- usually an arrested-development story if not as arrested as in Theres Something About Mary -- by wrapping itself in cool and irony registers not often present in a genre better known for heat and heart. Irony and cool drive the soundtrack which folds the story in self-consciousness sometimes nearly suffocating it. Bow Wow Wows ""I Want Candy"" blares when the 12-year-old Rob first takes note of the newly sprouted breasts bobbing around him; years later Freddie Mercury howls ""We Are the Champions"" as Rob in misguided triumph makes an entrance into the world of singlehood. At the record store where Jack Black and Todd Louiso as Robs only employees continually threaten to snatch the movie from Cusack the music streams from the sublime (Marvin Gaye) to the ghastly (Katrina and the Waves) and always with a wink -- Harry Nilssons ""The Moonbeam Song"" is among the songs cued. The literary references are similarly savvy (The Unbearable Lightness of Being) the Chicago locations unadorned while the art direction looks funky enough to almost pass for real life. The script is amusing if baggy with most of the funny stuff straight from the book such as Robs realization that a woman saves her fancy underwear for dating only to chuck the lace for cotton once shes moved in. And perhaps because its about a guy and stars a guy and was written by guys and directed by a guy and mostly produced by guys High Fidelity is also a romantic comedy in which women play a lot of the roles but not for long. Thats too bad because the film is filled with interesting women who all seem happy to be sharing the screen with Cusack if only for a few minutes. Theres Lili Taylor managing a fine sympathetic approximation of what you imagine the actual Lili Taylor is like in life -- earnest soft-spoken slightly withdrawn but not neurotically so. And a sexy mellow turn by Lisa Bonet as a singer who blows a little smoke into Peter Framptons ""Baby I Love Your Way."" Nearly as unexpected is Catherine Zeta-Jones who struts through the movie out of place -- or maybe out of rhythm -- as the woman who broke Robs heart after tattooing her insouciance on his memory. Zeta-Jones doesnt fit into the movie very convincingly yet she has the big Hollywood presence that allows her to hold her own against a scene stealer like Cusack. Hjejle a Danish actor who looks somewhat like Patricia Arquette though without the stunned glaze is more accomplished but she doesnt have Zeta-Jones largesse Bonets dazzle or Taylors soul which means that the most important woman in Robs life is also played by the dullest. High Fidelity wants to be hip but its comically square. The book is a clever enough manual about men behaving badly and how if they would only grow up they could be rewarded with a grown woman like Laura -- for all its allusions and blurb quotations its Bridget Joness Diary for the other side. The movie is more fun but it isnt interesting or new and it certainly isnt His Girl Friday. Thats a lofty standard to be sure and High Fidelity is doubtless a better romantic comedy than anything Nora Ephron or Garry Marshall will ever slough off. At the same time it isnt anywhere as satisfying as My Best Friends Wedding which was directed by P.J. Hogan who knows how to make a film move if not always in the right direction and isnt accounted as good or sophisticated a director as Frears. (He made the grotesquely unfunny Muriels Wedding.) Yet My Best Friends Wedding doesnt just move it glides eased along by the sense that nobody is taking any of it especially the movie seriously. If High Fidelity does move its because Cusack whos often seen speaking directly into the camera in locations all over town seems to be dragging his troubles with him around Chicago -- troubles he and the movie take entirely too seriously. These scenes are as unpersuasive and awkward as Robs sartorial attempts at Lou Reed cool; they have none of the breeziness of shared secrets but the heft of confession and as with much of the movie grow tiresome fast. Two hours of narcissism are difficult to take even when its John Cusack delivering the bad news. Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm Frears has had ups and downs but here hes stuck in neutral with filmmaking as square as the story. Save for a cameo by Bruce Springsteen who enters the film like a gift theres little to suggest that this movie is from the same man who directed My Beautiful Laundrette and Sammy and Rosie Get Laid. High Fidelity has none of the joyous pop verve of those earlier features and none of the coiled intensity of Frears most successful Hollywood movies Dangerous Liaisons and The Grifters the sleek neo-noir in which Cusack played a con artist with a lethal Oedipus complex. As with Frears last film The Hi-Lo Country this new movie has a draggy overextended vibe. Part of the problem is Cusack whose obvious appeal has always worked a counterpoint to his low-key reactive performance style. Cusack has ineffable charm but he keeps it tuned at the lowest possible frequency. Its that sense of modesty real or feigned that from Say Anything on has made him the type women want to end up with after getting burned or left on ice. Yet for all that Cusack has never settled comfortably into the role of leading man -- you get the feeling that the idea of taking up that kind of space and that kind of attention embarrasses him. Hes a reluctant hero which is why hes so good at playing bad and why after slipping into his characters surliness here he seems to have a hard time coming out again. Or maybe its just that Cusack is as skeptical of Robs impending happy ending as we are. HIGH FIDELITY | Directed by STEPHEN FREARS | Written by D.V.

Comments High Fidelity Recommended Video Watch on Amazon Rated R  113 minutes  2000 If you can put up with all the archness and self-consciousness--theres quite a bit of both--this is an enjoyable romantic comedy (2000) about a pop music junkie (John Cusack) in Wicker Park who runs an old-fashioned record store and cant seem to sustain a long-term relationship. Cusack joined forces with fellow producers D.V. DeVincentis and Steve Pink as well as Scott Rosenberg on the script an adaptation of Nick Hornbys English novel that transposes settings with ease and director Stephen Frears keeps things simmering. Two pluses the humor about male neurosis doesnt try to remind you of Woody Allen at every turn and the Chicago settings and atmosphere are made to seem relatively cutting edge for a change rather than appropriate only for car chases. With Jack Black and Lisa Bonet.

The owner of a barely surviving Chicago record store Rob has two obsessions in life--music and the women who have rejected him. Rob has an encyclopedic memory for every humiliation he has suffered going back to grammar school but his recall is faulty when it comes to the pain hes inflicted himself. The latest to leave is Laura (Iben Hjejle). She has not yet made his top-five list of painful breakups but as soon as he hears that she has taken up with a pony-tailed creep (Tim Robbins) who used to live upstairs she makes the grade. ""Number five with a bullet"" Rob tells us.Nick Hornbys novel was set in London. Screenwriters D. V. DeVincentis Steve Pink Cusack and Scott Rosenberg wittily reset it in Chicago and Stephen Frears directs with unassuming brio. ""High Fidelity"" is a sympathetic but unusually incisive portrait of the stunted male ego perpetually trapped in an adolescent tape loop of sexual insecurity paranoia and fantasy. Rob--who pours out his woes directly to the camera taking us into his confidence--is a deeply flawed guy but its impossible not to like him or cheer him on as he stumbles his way into belated adulthood. Cusack is a master at playing smart frazzled self-flagellating hipsters and the movie propelled by his arias of angst lets him strut his best stuff.Cusack may be in every scene but hes not the only source of hilarity. At his store he is saddled with two employees so far gone in their musical geekdom as to make Rob seem a model of sanity. Todd Louiso as the pale tremulous socially retarded Dick and Jack Black as the bullying volatile musical snob Barry are the movies inspired Laurel and Hardy. Among the women past and present in Robs life are Lili Taylor Lisa Bonet Joelle Carter and Catherine Zeta-Jones all of whom shine. But its Hjejles slightly chilly Laura an intriguing mix of masculine and feminine about whom Rob obsesses like a broken record. Can he win her back? This romantic-comedy trope is the least compelling part of the movie theres no great spark between the actors. Even so ""High Fidelity"" never feels formulaic. Its an inside job refreshingly specific. You dont feel there were armies of studio execs breathing down the filmmakers necks trying to reach for the lowest common denominator. ""It wasnt spectacular"" Rob reminisces about first meeting Laura. ""Just good--really good."" The same could be said for ""High Fidelity.""

(Touchstone) ""High Fidelity"" a stinging stereophonic yarn follows the hilarious romantic travails of overgrown slacker Rob Gordon (John Cusack) a thirtyish retro-record-store owner whos been stuck in the same groove since quitting college in the 80s. Though many girlfriends have tried none has ever been able to needle him out of his prolonged adolescence. Adapted from British author Nick Hornbys quirky cult novel the freewheeling comedy is faithful to the original except that the hapless hero is no longer a Londoner but a Chicagoan. Not that the geography really matters much as the story takes place in its own geeky little world a veritable dorkery of pop music freaks. The hub of this parallel universe is Championship Vinyl Robs failing business. Few customers patronize this grungy shop with its cache of rare albums. And those who do are usually ignored or on occasion shown the door. Thus Rob and his eccentric employees Barry (Jack Black) and Dick (Todd Louiso) spend the hours arguing arcane trivia and making up Top Five lists (Top Five first cuts on first albums and so forth). Although deejays have become CD-jays Rob and the other lost boys are still having a blast in the past. But all that changes when his live-in lover Laura (Danish actress Iben Hjejle) gets fed up with his aimlessness and dumps him for their ponytailed patchouli-drenched neighbor (played with smarmy relish by Tim Robbins). Suddenly the postmodern Peter Pan is jolted into rethinking his residency in Never-Never Land. To that end he revisits his Top Five Most Painful Split-Ups in hopes of finding some key to his failed love life. In a series of flashbacks Rob recalls his last days with lost loves from junior high (Shannon Stillo) high school (Joelle Carter) college (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and young adulthood (Lili Taylor). Many flashbacks and soliloquies later it hits him Lauras about to become the fifth on that list too. And hes got to get her back. Rob self-indulgent cynical and narcissistic isnt the most sympathetic fellow. But he befriends the audience in frequent funny and inclusive asides. Youre charmed by his honesty and you cheer his first tentative steps toward adulthood. He convinces viewers the males anyhow that hes just like them an ordinary guy without a clue when it comes to commitment. And women are charmed by the boyish qualities he attempts to shed. Black the lead singer for the band Tenacious D sparks the proceedings in the showboating role of Barry an obnoxious music snob and foil for his timorous co-worker Dick expertly portrayed by Louiso. Pale shy and easily startled Louisos Dick always looks as if somebody just picked up his rock. The story may be told from a male point of view but the distaff players--Taylor Carter Zeta-Jones Joan Cusack Lisa Bonet and Natasha Gregson Wagner--are vivid and arrestingly complex in supporting roles. The films music deftly chosen and wide-ranging includes 61 songs from performers ranging from Bob Dylan to the 13th Floor Elevators. Bruce Springsteen who makes a cameo appearance in one of Robs dreams provides sensible advice for the lovelorn hero. Not that Rob has the sense to take it. The loosely structured screenplay was written by Cusack D.V. DeVincentis and Steve Pink who also collaborated on ""Grosse Point Blank."" And the incomparable director Stephen Frears makes harmony of ""High Fidelitys"" many changes in tempo and tone. Why not give it a spin? HIGH FIDELITY (107 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for profanity and sensuality.

With John Cusack Jack Black Iben Jhejle. Directed by Stephen Frears. Running time 113 min. Rated R Adult situations language. At area theaters. 3 1/2 stars Like the song says love stinks. But heartbreak is rarely funnier than in ""High Fidelity"" a smart and ultra-engaging comedy about an average Joe whos starting to detect a pattern - women keep dumping him. Why is that? he wonders as he slams the door on yet another ego-bruising kiss-off. John Cusack is an immensely likable lead - he even passes as a teenager during the flashbacks - as Rob Gordon a Chicago record-store owner who can barely ring up a sale let alone have a relationship. The store serves more as an environment for him and his geeky music-snob employees than as a source of actual income. Robs latest girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle) just left him for a geeky guru (Tim Robbins) and Rob analyzes the situation the only way he knows how - by making lists of the Top 5 songs albums or recording artists that best express his feelings of the moment. He also torments himself by going back in his mind over the Top 5 women who left him and eventually looks them up to get an even more-definitive reading on his failures as boyfriend and lover. In the process he learns a little about what it takes to grow up. The movie is constructed as a kind of internal monologue that wells up so forcefully in Robs brain that he often turns to the camera to spill his guts directly. While tearfully reorganizing his records by his emotional attachment to them or slung across an armchair in a lump of bitter self-loathing Rob treats the camera as both confessor and partner in crime. In a funny series of virtual cameos as the women who love him and leave him are Joelle Carter Sara Gilbert Lili Taylor and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Other women in his life include Lisa Bonet and Natasha Gregson Wagner. Cusacks real-life sister Joan Cusack is effortlessly hilarious as a friend with divided loyalties. There are a lot of wonderful supporting roles here but the actor wholl get the most mileage is Jack Black in a career-setting turn as an obnoxious slacker who works in Robs record store. He refuses to sell to customers who are too uncool or whose taste differs from his by a single degree. When director Stephen Frears worked with this guy he must have yelled ""Let er rip"" instead of ""Action"" Adapted to Chicago from the London-set Nick Hornby bestseller ""High Fidelity"" mines the Mars-Venus divide between the sexes for observations that would seem brutish if they were not so exquisitely on the mark.

Directed by Stephen Frears from a script by John Cusack D.V. DeVincentis Steve Pink Scott Rosenberg based on Nick Hornbys novel. 113 minutes. Several theaters. ""R"" - Restricted because of language and some sexuality. ""Did I listen to pop music because I was miserable or was I miserable because I listened to pop music?"" Its a question that must be asked in ""High Fidelity"" Stephen Frears entertaining carefully cast adaptation of Nick Hornbys 1995 novel about an obsessive record-store owner who is unlucky in love. Fortunately the music not the misery is what dominates the movie which is hilarious and high-spirited whenever Rob Gordon (John Cusack) and his fetchingly anti-social employees - the snobbish Barry (Jack Black) and the quieter Dick (Todd Louiso) - are insulting the customers and discussing their favorite rock artists. They may fail at their official business goal but Championship Vinyl is the kind of retro record store that never seems to rely on selling anything to justify its existence. Its more about spreading the employees encyclopedic knowledge of pop music boasting about collectors items and making lists of all-time favorites (one favorite list is the five best songs about death). The screenplay which is partly Cusacks work also gives a rundown of Robs most memorable romantic disasters. While hes breaking up with Laura (Iben Hjejle) the latest woman to walk he insults her by insisting that she doesnt even make his top five. If she really wanted to mess him up he claims she ""should have got to me earlier."" In the book this tirade is delivered introspectively which makes it seem less abusive toward her and less shrill. Rob spends much of the movie pining (and whining) for Laura while recalling his kamikaze relationships with women played by Lili Taylor and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Its reminiscent of Jack Nicholsons misogynistic recitation of the women who ruined him in ""Carnal Knowledge"" and it gets a little wearying partly because were never given a compelling reason for Laura and Rob to get back together. Readers of the novel will be shocked to discover that the location of the story has been moved from London to Chicago but the switch never becomes a problem. The record-store stuff is still as specific as it is funny. The eclectic soundtrack includes everything from Lou Reed to Liz Phair; theres even a cute cameo role for Bruce Springsteen. Its the scripts more universal love story that flirts with cliches. Rob wonders why hes doomed to be rejected while never quite establishing why he wants Laura back so badly. Cusack worked with Frears nearly a decade ago on ""The Grifters"" which gave the actor his first strong adult role and once more the collaboration seems to have benefited them both. Cusack works especially well with the unknowns in the cast while Frears creates an ensemble that complements Cusacks more flamboyant moments. Hjejle who has the most thankless part nevertheless makes a seamless transition from Danish movies (""Mifune"" ""Portland"") to her first American role. Black (a veteran of Tim Robbins films) and Louiso (star of Tom Stoppards ""The Fifteen Minute Hamlet"") are true finds. Indeed they steal every scene that Cusack hasnt nailed down.

`High Fi Is A Hip Shot - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Elvis Costello `High Fi Is A Hip ShotMOVIES - Movie reviewSelf-absorbed Film Is Way Cool Even If Its Aim Is A Bit UnsteadyMarch 31 2000|By Jay Boyar Sentinel Movie CriticIf you were to make a list of the top-five hippest films of the year so far High Fidelity would have to be on it.Not that there has been all that much competition lately. Hip is not the word that springs immediately to mind as you watch say Hanging Up - except perhaps in the hip-replacement-surgery sense.John Cusack the star of High Fidelity is a very hip sort of actor especially after his star turn in Being John Malkovich arguably the hippest film of last year. And not only is Cusack the star of the new film he also co-wrote and co-produced it.This time Cusack plays Rob Gordon the thirtysomething owner of Championship Vinyl a Chicago record store that specializes in vintage albums. Rob is also a list guy - the sort of person who obsessively works out numerical rankings of his top-five worst romantic break-ups the top-five songs about death of all time and possibly the top-five hippest films of the year.As High Fidelity opens Rob is finding it hard to face the fact that Laura his longtime live-in girlfriend has gotten so sick of his selfish unambitious existence that she has dropped him. So as Rob starts to think about his all-time worst breakups the film flashes back to his many romantic misadventures.Based on the novel by Nick Hornby this movie (which opens today) must have been fun for co-producer Cusack to help cast Robs girlfriends past and present include some very beautiful and/or intriguing women.In addition to the fetching Danish actress Iben Hjejle who plays Laura there are Catherine Zeta-Jones as a gorgeous college student Natasha Gregson Wagner as a winsome rock reporter and Joelle Carter as an attractive movie critic (most of us trust me dont look that good) plus indie-queen Lili Taylor and Roseannes Sara Gilbert.Lisa Bonet formerly of The Cosby Show pops up as a sexy folk singer who gets involved with Rob. Her presence in the cast gives a special frisson to a scene in which someone ridicules Robs sweater by calling it a ``Cosby sweater.Stephen Frears who worked with Cusack on the 1990 film noir The Grifters directs a cast that also includes Tim Robbins as the ponytailed dude who takes Laura away from Rob and Johns sister Joan Cusack as Robs best friend as well as Bruce Springsteen who plays himself in a cameo.How hip is thatAdding to the hip factor is an extravagantly eclectic soundtrack featuring everyone from Liz Phair to Lou Reed Elton John to Stevie Wonder Bob Dylan to Elvis Costello (who by the way once wrote and recorded a song called ``High Fidelity).But hip though it is this film does have a tendency to unravel - to become as self-absorbed and aimless as Rob himself. Cusacks collaborators on the script are D.V. DeVincentis and Steve Pink who also worked on Cusacks Grosse Pointe Blank (which also was a little too hip for its own good) plus Scott Rosenberg (the flagrantly unhip Con Air).Cusacks performance however is very nimble. Its not easy to make an audience care about a hero who when you come right down to it isnt always very nice. And Cusack manages the difficult trick of sometimes speaking directly to the camera and sometimes to the other actors.Todd Louiso and Jack Black - as Dick and Barry a newfangled Laurel and Hardy team of music-obsessed Championship Vinyl employees - end up stealing the show.With his passive presence and nervous eyes Louiso is quietly hilarious. And Black whose character is both arrogant and bombastic is even funnier.For tall bald twitchy Dick and plump wild-eyed Barry musical connoisseurism isnt just a hobby its a way of life. Theyre not just fans of their favorite musicians theyre scruffy acolytes who consider musical bad taste to be sufficient grounds for total contempt.If either of these guys were to make a list of the top-five most important things in life it would be a list of nothing but vinyl albums.

"Cusack makes big noise in High Fidelity | CJOnline.com Toggle navigation Home News Local Business Sports Weather Subscribe Obits Classifieds Classifieds Local Jobs Homes Search Cusack makes big noise in High Fidelity High Fidelity Posted Friday March 31 2000 By BOB THOMASThe Associated Press John Cusack is one of the most talented and versatile actors in films today brilliant in drama (""Cradle Will Rock"") and comedy (""Being John Malkovich""). Judging from his latest film ""High Fidelity"" hes also not lacking in chutzpah. Cusack co-wrote and co-produced the picture and he appears in almost every frame. Furthermore he spends a large percentage of the running time looking into the camera and spilling his innermost thoughts. Along with wall-to-wall Cusack the movie has wall-to-wall music all of it vintage pop. The credits list 61 recorded numbers which must be a milestone for movie soundtracks even in this era of oldie-but-goodie overkill. But at least theres a reason for ""High Fidelitys"" hit parade As the title suggests music is the films underlying theme. Cusack operates a Chicago store that sells only vinyl records -- thats how much of a purist he is. He is assisted by two equally devoted collectors Todd Louiso as a rotund fellow who is bombastic in his musical prejudices and Jack Black as a timid soul who is equally firm in his opinions. Since few customers arrive to disturb them the trio spends most of their time discussing esoteric matters of pop-music history. They are hooked on top-five lists which they compile periodically. Cusack is working on a top-five list of another kind too. After his live-in girlfriend (Iben Hjejle) walks out on him he frets about his history of failed relationships. He makes a list of the top five girlfriends who have dumped him. And he vows to seek them out and discover how he failed. Meanwhile he has a fling with a well-known singer (Lisa Bonet). ""High Fidelity"" resembles early Woody Allen works in which he agonized over his romances often relating his failings directly to the audience. Another similarity the use of oldtime records (though Allens taste leans more toward middle-of-the-road classics). The screenplay based on a novel by Nick Hornby is the work of D.V. DeVincentis Steve Pink and Scott Rosenberg all of whom are also listed among the movies eight producers. The film betrays evidence of too many cooks. Continuity suffers as Cusack encounters the five former lovers in real time as well as in flashbacks. Stephen Frears -- director of ""Dangerous Liaisons"" ""The Grifters"" and ""My Beautiful Laundrette"" -- seems on unsteady ground converting an essentially British story (the novel was set in London) to the American idiom. The characters are thinly drawn and Louiso is especially obnoxious redeeming himself as a talented blues shouter at the end. Danish actress Hjejle makes an impressive American debut as Cusacks once and future girlfriend and real-life sister Joan Cusack adds zest as his sternest critic. Tim Robbins appears briefly in a geekish role that doesnt quite pay off. ""High Fidelity"" a Buena Vista release of a Touchstone Picture is rated R for language and sexual material. It opens today at the West Ridge 6. See movie directory advertisement for show times. Related Searches THE GRIFTERS IBEN HJEJLE WOODY ALLEN CRADLE WILL ROCK HIGH FIDELITY MICROSOFT VISTA D.V.

"Cusack Is in Groove in Fidelity - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMovie Review Cusack Is in Groove in FidelityMarch 31 2000|KENNETH TURAN | TIMES FILM CRITIC ""What came first"" Rob Gordon (John Cusack) desperately wants to know ""the music or the misery?""Over-stimulated by the sounds coming out of his outsize headphones morose Rob is seizing the moment of his breakup with Laura (Iben Hjejle) to reflect on ""the thousands of hours of heartache rejection pain misery and loss"" he experienced while exposing himself to wave after wave of popular music. ""Did I listen because I was miserable"" he wonders ""or was I miserable because I listened?""Further proof of how funny we can be when were at our most despondent ""High Fidelity"" is a sharp and satisfying romantic comedy about the difficulty of commitment that utilizes Stephen Frears incisive direction and some very knowing and sophisticated writing to give actor Cusack one of the best roles of his career.That is saying something because Cusack talented as well as shrewd about what he gets himself into doesnt go in for weak material. Rob Gordon a part Cusack had a hand in writing is specifically tailored to his everyman persona to his gift for intimacy with the audience and his ability to humanize characters who are difficult and potentially off-putting.The last time out for Cusack and writing partners D.V. DeVincentis and Steve Pink was ""Grosse Point Blank"" in which the actor played a hit man with a career crisis; ""High Fidelity"" presents them with a character who faces a less lethal kind of challenge. (Scott Rosenberg of the glib ""Things to Do in Denver When Youre Dead"" and ""Con Air"" also gets a writing credit.)The Cusack pack had the advantage of starting from Nick Hornbys fine novel a delightful book that is very savvy about the vagaries of relationships especially from the male point of view. Its Rob using either voice-over or direct talk to the camera who preserves the books first-person quality as well as chunks of its dialogue. ""High Fidelity"" presents him as someone whos his own worst enemy a tortured and grumpy eternal adolescent who doesnt have to hide his weakness for being a real jerk to gain our sympathy.Given his opening rant about the pernicious effect of lyrics its not a surprise that Robs life is pop music. He owns Championship Vinyl a Chicago establishment (smoothly moved from the novels London) thats a shrine to old-fashioned phonograph records and mecca to obsessive geeks who ""spend a disproportionate amount of their time looking for deleted Smiths singles and ORIGINAL NOT RERELEASED underlined Frank Zappa albums.""This universes two biggest geeks Dick and Barry a.k.a. ""the musical moron twins"" just happen to work for Rob and as played by Todd Louiso and Jack Black are the comic center of the film. Dick is the sensitive flower while Barry is rowdy abrasive and downright hilarious. They join Rob in insulting the customers making abstruse jokes about the Beta Band and Ryuichi Sakamoto and constructing an endless number of all-time Top 5 lists from Top 5 dream jobs to Top 5 songs about death (""Leader of the Pack"" ""Dead Mans Curve"" ""Tell Laura I Love Her"" etc).Though the Championship Vinyl store (magnificently created for the film by a crew that includes production designers David Chapman and Therese DePrez art director Nicholas Lund set decorator Larry P. Lundy and property master Timothy W. Tiedje) is real enough to be a character in its own right its not the best place for empathy and thats what Rob needs after his break with Laura. Initially he faces the split with bravado yelling at her that she doesnt even make his all-time Top 5 list of memorable split-ups (yes he has one) but that fighting spirit is not fated to last.As the pain of Lauras absence (and her possible connection with someone else) sinks in Rob is forced for perhaps the first time to think about his life and confront his difficulty with romance and commitment. ""Whats wrong with me? Why am I doomed to be left?"" he wonders plaintively and in an attempt to find out thinks back on that list of all-time memorable ruptures amusingly reconsidering liaisons with Catherine Zeta-Jones Lili Taylor and others.Director Frears who is noticeably good with realistic relationships that have a touch of comedy in them (""The Snapper"" ""My Beautiful Laundrette"") knows his way around this scenario. Under his guidance Cusacks painful but funny reexamination leads to a getting of wisdom that is no less welcome for coming years later than it should have.Cusack with his ability to project glowering desperation and a sense of aggrieved entitlement is perfect for this role. As Laura the woman he cant live with or without Danish actress Hjejle (recently seen as a prostitute-turned-housekeeper in that countrys ""Mifune"") displays both faultless English and a formidable sense of integrity that allows her to more than hold her own in fairly heady company.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESJohn Cusack joins Peter Gabriel at Hollywood BowlOctober 8 2012The Raven actor John Cusack gets star on Hollywood Walk...April 25 2012Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword",http://articles.latimes.com/2000/mar/31/entertainment/ca-14405,200,highfidelity15,highfidelity,latimes

Top five reasons why ""High Fidelity"" is some kind of wonderful (1) John Cusacks fresh fearless and ferociously funny lead performance; (2) trenchantly witty and acutely insightful script; (3) surprising faithfulness to first-rate source material; (4) cunningly graceful direction by Stephen Frears who smoothly maneuvers through mood swings and tempo variegations; and (5) its the first great date movie of 2000. All of this may not be enough to guarantee big B.O. since teens may prove immune to the films older-skewing charms. But Baby Boomers and Gen-Xers should respond sufficiently to enable this freewheeling comedy-drama to surpass the performance of the last pic Cusack D.V. DeVincentis and Steve Pink co-wrote ""Grosse Pointe Blank"" and enjoy a healthy afterlife in homevid. The loose-knit plot has been transposed from the funky London environs of Nick Hornbys novel but the picture which world preemed at the SXSW Festival in Austin Texas is smashingly successful at reconstituting the authors sensibility and sense of humor in and around downtown Chicago. Cusack gets most of the best lines almost all of which are taken verbatim from the book. And he delivers the dialogue with exceptional panache whenever hes knocking down the fourth wall to directly address the audience. The first-person approach is tricky to pull off in cinema -- for every ""Alfie"" there are a dozen cringe-worthy embarrassments -- but Cusack makes it work with more than a little help from Frears. Cusack plays Rob Gordon a blithely unambitious thirtysomething who fell into a semi-comfortable rut years ago when he opened Championship Vinyl a retro record store. As ""Fidelity"" begins Rob is jolted into taking stock of his aimless existence when his longtime live-in girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle) gets fed up and walks out. Trouble is Rob is averse to introspection. Instead of asking himself painful questions hed really rather banter with his oddball employees -- Barry (Jack Black) a burly and surly music snob and Dick (Todd Louiso) a timorously insubstantial fellow. During the long and frequent hours when Championship Vinyl reps a customer-free zone Rob and his workers create various all-time top five lists of songs and singers (top five songs about death top five first cuts on first albums etc.). When it comes to self-assessment Rob remains obsessed with list-making to the point of compiling an all-time top five most memorable split-ups. This cues a series of flashbacks as Rob recalls among others a dazzling college coed (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who unceremoniously dumped him for someone more exciting and a broken-hearted manic-depressive (Lili Taylor) who did the same. Throughout ""High Fidelity"" Cusack remains scrupulously true to the character Hornby created an overgrown adolescent whos too narcissistic and self-indulgent to be easily liked but too willing to admit his more unpleasant qualities to be wholly unsympathetic. He knows hes a son of a bitch and really would like to be if not a much better person then at least not so much of a rotter. At heart ""High Fidelity"" is the story of a cynically hip Peter Pan who almost in spite of himself drags himself a few tentative paces closer to full-fledged adulthood. (One minor quibble While compiling Robs top five break-ups the movie inexplicably fails to mention scenario No. 3 -- which in Hornbys book reveals a teenage Rob at his most ruthlessly selfish.) Frears who a decade ago directed Cusack in ""The Grifters"" (1990) takes a Euro approach to his storytelling here allowing the narrative to unfold with a randomness that is doubtless more apparent than real. Appropriately enough for a pic that deals with albums Frears varies the pace as artfully as an ace record producer Scenes that play like standup comedy riffs are interspersed with rancorous one-on-one conversations three-way verbal horseplay in the record store fateful reunions with old flames wide-awake daydreams of violent revenge and in an audacious what-the-hell fantasy bit advice to the lovelorn delivered by the Boss himself Bruce Springsteen. Much of ""High Fidelity"" is given over to the question of whether Laura will return to Rob or stick with a new prospect. Decked out in a ponytail and neo-hippie attire Tim Robbins comes across as rather more ridiculous than necessary as Ian an aggressively soulful attorney who works with Laura and eases his way into her heart. Blame it on the actor the writers or the director -- or maybe all three -- but almost every scene with this character is a dreary drag. The only excuse for his existence is a hilarious wish-dream in which Ian is battered by Rob and his employees. Other supporting characters -- including Liz Lauras best buddy played by Joan Cusack (Johns real-life sister) -- are better written and more amusingly played. At the record store its a toss-up as to whos funnier Black (who has a slight edge because of his blunderbuss sarcasm) or Louiso. Elsewhere memorable cameo bits are offered by Zeta-Jones Taylor and Lisa Bonet as a sultry folk singer who enjoys a brief bit of recreational sex with Rob. In fleetingly are Sara Gilbert as a customer who catches Dicks eye and Natasha Gregson Wagner as a rock journalist who really really wants to know everything about Rob. In a striking change of pace from her recent turn as a hooker-turned-housekeeper in ""Mifune"" Danish-born Iben Hjejle makes an auspicious U.S. debut as Laura vividly conveying her characters profoundly mixed emotions about Rob. Theres a slight but unmistakable trace of an accent in her line readings and maybe someone should have written a line to justify that. But never mind Hjejle is effective and affecting and she makes it clear that Laura wont be a pushover when Rob sets out to win her back. Production-wise ""High Fidelity"" is a slick and sleek package that not surprisingly offers an abundance of familiar (and not-so-familiar) pop tunes on an extremely busy soundtrack.

DeVincentis Steve Pink Scott Rosenberg; Producer (person) John Cusack; Release Date Wide 03/31/2000; Runtime (in minutes) 107; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Touchstone Pictures Posted March 24 2000 -- 1200 AM EST Who will be the Last Bohemian? The East Village punk with nine nose rings who finally pierces his own spleen? The teen cyberculture revolutionary who declares war on his school in a chat room? The light and flaky romantic comedy High Fidelity takes a somewhat more whimsical view. Adapted - or should I say transplanted - from Nick Hornbys 1995 novel which is set in London the movie dares to envision the Last Bohemian as Rob Gordon (John Cusack) a boyishly rueful Chicago underachiever in his early 30s who might be described quite simply as a guy who likes records. You know those round grooved shiny black things with tiny holes in the middle that people used to spin for pleasure. Rob a part-time dance-club DJ hoards shelfloads of them in his apartment and he runs a low-budget connoisseurs shop called Championship Vinyl thats like an extension of his home collection. He keeps the LPs in clear plastic sleeves the way that certain old couples for decades maintain their sofas in protective slipcovers. He doesnt just love pop music; he loves the pastness of it the way that it binds him to the sweet seductions of memory. Rob employs two quasi-hapless music nuts the bald neurasthenic Dick (Todd Louiso) and the portly monomaniacal Barry (Jack Black) and the three of them sit around the store all day obsessing over the pop and rock of the 60s 70s and 80s - and current faves too like the Beta Band - as if they were monks debating sacred texts of medieval catechism. Directed by Stephen Frears (""The Grifters"") ""High Fidelity"" is a cute quaint at times rather silly movie that displays a genuine affection for the rebel-nerd scholasticism of record-store junkies. Dressed in their promo T-shirts and off-the-thrift-shop-rack monstrosities Rob and his coworkers hide behind the songs they love turning the cherished tracks into advertisements for their hidden emotions; at the same time they use taste as a weapon. Cusack terrific as he was in ""Being John Malkovich"" comes on more and more these days as a hip over-actor who italicizes every bon mot with his hyperarticulate archness. In ""High Fidelity"" which Cusack cowrote and coproduced with D.V. DeVincentis and Steve Pink the same team he collaborated with on ""Grosse Pointe Blank"" (the other screenwriter is Scott Rosenberg) Rob spends much of the movie addressing us directly coyly breaking the fourth wall as he describes his bittersweet history of romantic failure. We see a parade of his former flames including one played by the joker-eyed tigress Catherine Zeta-Jones. We also get the saga of his current girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle) who abandons him without quite breaking up bouncing back and forth between Rob and the ludicrous cell-phone hippie (Tim Robbins) upstairs a situation that results in far too many shots of Rob pining away in the rain. For all its music-trivia affection ""High Fidelity"" is finally a pretty thin melody. I enjoyed the oddball references the amused celebration of Top 40 trash like ""The Night Chicago Died"" (by Paper Lace in case you were wondering). Yet I missed the deeper wilder love of pop thats expressed in say the opening scene of ""Reservoir Dogs"" with Quentin Tarantinos adult hoodlums sitting around a diner debating the meaning of Madonnas ""Like a Virgin"" as if it were as vital a matter as the heist for which theyd been assembled. In ""High Fidelity"" Robs music fixation is a signpost of his arrested adolescence; he needs to get past records to find true love. If the movie had had a richer romantic spirit he might have embraced both in one swooning gesture.

Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Nick Hornby Entertainment News When a book develops a pop-culture following the way Nick Hornbys ""High Fidelity"" did you can bet there are going to be thousands of people out there holding their breath hoping that the movie version will somehow measure up to the source material.They can breathe easy. Stephen Frears adaptation of Hornbys 1995 novel is spiritually faithful despite the fact that the setting has been moved from London to Chicago. Anyone whos ever been or even just known a record geek can tell you that love of vinyl knows no geographical boundaries. And besides that ""High Fidelity"" like the book its based on is essentially a story about the overwhelming power of pop culture -- not just the way it can illuminate every element of our existence but also the way it can cloud our judgment. Pop music can be like a prism hanging in the window a gorgeous little thing through which everything in life is filtered. But it can also be an excuse for never leaving the couch to actually live and Frears like Hornby is acutely aware of that.Rob (John Cusack) is one of those guys who know they cant live on the couch -- not all the time at least -- which is why he runs a marginal but mostly just really cool record store called Championship Vinyl on a Chicago side street that doesnt get much foot traffic. Robs the kind of guy for whom music is everything and with that unrepentant certainty comes a kind of snobbery. He and his two even geekier employees Barry (Jack Black) and Dick (Todd Louiso) spend their days tormenting customers and making top-five lists. To hear them talk youd think their lives were nothing more than endless tangles of lists their top-five movies their top-five records about death their top-five opening album tracks. Rob even has a list of top-five breakups and the story opens with his split from girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle) just cracking it -- shes left him for ponytailed New Age drip Ian (Tim Robbins in a small but highly amusing role). Rob mourns the breakup by trying to figure out why he cant keep a relationship together tracking down every girlfriend who ever spurned him and discovering in the process that in some cases he had been the one to do the spurning. And he also plays records. Lots of them.""High Fidelity"" is less a story with a real plot than a snapshot of that hazy miserable time just after a breakup when things are horrible when you realize that everything about you needs to be reassessed and when if youre that kind of person you need to play a lot of records. Its the kind of picture that rides on the strength of its writing and its characters and even though Frears occasionally lets the pacing go a little slack for the most part the story hums along pleasurably. Thats due in part to the casual easygoing sharpness of the script an ensemble effort by D.V. DeVincentis Steve Pink Cusack and Scott Rosenberg. There are plenty of wiseacre jokes as when Barry makes a crack about a seen-better-days pullover that Robs taken to wearing calling it a ""Cosby sweater."" But the bons mots are never suffocating or tiresome tempered as they are by the occasional tender moment At one point Rob gathers up some clothes Laura has left behind and inhales their scent. He cant help following the gesture with a bitter quip about how girls always save their best underwear for the times they know theyre going to get laid and wear the tatty stuff the rest of the time. But then this is a guy whos just been dumped.Every single actor here rises to the occasion. Joan Cusack as a friend of Rob and Lauras whos caught in their crossfire shows off her usual whip-smart timing. Black is almost too painfully accurate as the most annoying species of record-store geek the kind whos sure he knows everything and wholl cut you down for inaccuracy if you happen to wrongly (or even rightly) add ""the"" to a song title. Hjejles Laura is supremely likable Shes so matter-of-fact and grounded that its perfectly clear why shed become exasperated with a guy like Rob who perpetually refuses to grow up but you can also see how her patience and calm are exactly the things he needs. And Louisos Dick as the kind of timid soft-spoken music nerd whod take a sword through the heart in defending a Belle amp; Sebastian record practically creeps away on his plimsolls with the whole movie. Prematurely bald he resembles the old comic-strip character Henry only with tons more charisma. His walk is like an understated tentative march Just watching him stride his shoulders hunched his arms dangling haplessly out of his short thrift-shop shirtsleeves you feel youre seeing a marvel of subtle characterization. (And at the risk of giving too much away I nonetheless find it imperative to mention that he finds a nice girlfriend.) You Might Also Like And Cusack as he did in last years ""Being John Malkovich"" proves he doesnt necessarily have to play the nicest guy in the room. Hes always been such an incredibly winning actor -- his Lloyd Dobler in ""Say Anything ..."" represents the epitome of all there is to love about him -- that in the past few years it seemed as though it might be a good idea for him to cut some sharper teeth. His Rob has just the right amount of bite Cusack is a sly enough actor to let us see that for all Robs moaning and groaning about the way women have treated him hes got a bad case of lost-boy syndrome and as far as love goes his brain is so muddled that he wouldnt be able to spot his perfect Wendy if she were standing in front of him.While Rob is quick to chide his employees for their music snobbery which often seems to be merely an excuse to mock customers hes got a bad streak of it himself. In one scene he stands by amused as Barry refuses to sell a rare Captain Beefheart LP to a customer whos practically begging for it only to turn around and offer it to another customer for a measly 40 bucks. When it comes to love Cusack is terrific at that lovesick gob-smacked look It really kicks in as he gazes at Catherine Zeta-Jones as his college girlfriend Charlie -- his eyes become so liquid you could swim in them. But he doesnt use that look to endear himself to us or to seduce us as much as he does to signal Robs romantic cluelessness. He may be smitten but its a shallow cowardly kind of regard -- the kind you reserve for the most desirable prize of a girl not necessarily the one who can bring out the best in you.""High Fidelity"" has plenty going for it The acting is great the jokes are funny but oh the music. The songs are so well chosen -- never the most obvious choices but always interesting ones -- that they sometimes catch you up short. In an early scene Dick starts out his morning at the store by putting on Belle amp; Sebastians lovely mournful ""Seymour Stein"" only to have it snapped off by Barry who insists on hearing Katrina and the Waves ""Walking on Sunshine."" Later Rob tells his co-workers that hes going to sell five copies of an obscure band just by playing one striking track and sure enough we see a store full of guys with dubious facial hair suddenly bobbing their heads and asking ""What is this man?"" Rob Dick and Barrys obsessiveness is the movies constant gag and yet its never in doubt how much pleasure they get from the music. You cant blame them for wanting to have a soundtrack for their lives; life would be way too quiet without it. But it may be the constant presence of music more than the actual thing itself that gives ""High Fidelity"" its real shape. The store (which was built lovingly on a soundstage and includes albums from DeVincentis own collection) looks like a veritable Candyland for pop-music addicts; given the choice between visiting either of two mythical lands Id take Championship Vinyl over Oz any day.Theres also a touching kind of earnestness in the way Rob lovingly cleans 45s with a Discwasher pad as he tells us his tale of woe or in the way he declares that yeah hes read ""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"" and ""Love in the Time of Cholera"" -- but ""Cash"" by Johnny Cash is his favorite book. Or in the way that Rob Dick and Barry all smitten with a sexy lounge singer (the effortlessly alluring Lisa Bonet) each fantasize aloud not about sleeping with her but about the much-more-elusive pleasures that being romantically involved with her might bring Rob wonders if she might someday write a song that would include one of their little in-jokes; Dick muses that maybe shed include a picture of him on the sleeve of her next CD nothing elaborate just something blurry in the background.And when Rob at one point quietly declares his love for Charlie Richs ""Behind Closed Doors"" you recognize that for all his snobbishness for all his annoying waffling on issues of commitment his heart beats true. It may be wrong to use pop music as a kind of shield to protect you from experience but it seems wholly healthy to view it as a romantic training ground a place where all kinds of hopes and desires are dreamed about obsessed over test-driven. As the Beatles once sang ""Theres a place."" ""High Fidelity"" tells us where it is right in the groove. Stephanie Zacharek is a senior writer for Salon Arts amp; Entertainment.

"Broken Record Slate Sign In Sign Up Broken Record Broken Record Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.March 31 2000 930 PM Broken Record High Fidelity reproduces the language of Nick Hornbys novel but fails to capture its drama. By David Edelstein High Fidelity Directed by Stephen Frears Buena Vista Pictures High Fidelity displays unusually high fidelity to Nick Hornbys mordantly funny novel. The setting has shifted from London to Chicago to accommodate the star (and co-screenwriter and co-producer) John Cusack but much of Hornbys dialogue is intact and the movie opens and closes with bright narration from the book. The thinking must be that if you adapt a novel thats low on plot and characterization but has a hip voice you dont throw out its sexiest feature. You ought to do more with the prose than simply stick it in the mouth of the lead actor though. The story of a sourly self-absorbed jerk who cant fully share himself with anyone becomes the story of a guy who never stops yammering. Advertisement Still theres a lot to enjoy in High Fidelity. It has been directed by Stephen Frears in a style thats appealingly scruffy and Cusack is as likable an aging slacker as you could ever hope to hang with. Cool actors such as Tim Robbins Lili Taylor Lisa Bonet and Catherine Zeta-Jones pop up; and Bruce Springsteen offers guy-to-guy advice while strumming an acoustic guitar. Cameos flashbacks zany fantasies scenes repeated with different outcomes The movie is a slackers Annie Hall (1977). Its entirely pleasant--well worth seeing. But why does a film in which the protagonist spends so much time buttonholing the audience and complaining about his history of screwed-up relationships seem so lacking in intimacy? Hornbys novel was a bag of tricks too It had lists of girlfriends movies pop songs; it hopped around in time. But it also had a desperate careering quality along with an escalating sense of loneliness and dread. Maturity didnt come naturally to the narrator He had to be terrified into it and the pace of his progress was grueling. A couple of times I felt like throwing the book into the air and screaming. Had Hornby been spying on the most embarrassing moments in my life? More likely hed somehow put his finger on those shaming crises we all experience that say Evolve or be miserably stunted forever. The movie lacks the power of the book because it hasnt been fully dramatized. I blame this on the current vogue for narration once regarded by moviemakers as a no-no and now considered de rigueur. Narration can be helpful of course. Reviewing a stage adaptation of Pride and Prejudice Kenneth Tynan complained that the most important figure in the work had been left out Jane Austen whose running commentary on her characters turned a rather humdrum romance into one of the most penetrating portraits of courtship ever written. Narration can underline contradict and fill in the action of a play or movie but nowadays screenwriters are bringing it in too early before the work of building scenes has even begun (instead of as a last resort when dialogue cant take them any further). The upshot is that movies are turning into slide shows with commentary and theyre arms-length experiences. High Fidelity is full of sensational Hornby-derived lines but they dont always fall easily on the ear. Take the novels prologue in which the narrator Rob tells his freshly departed girlfriend Laura that she hasnt made the list of his top five most devastating breakups. ""If you really wanted to mess me up"" he concludes ""you should have got to me earlier."" The acid in that sentiment nearly eats through the page but in the movie it gets shouted out of a window at the fleeing lover and it sounds too literary too obviously facetious--not something someone would scream in the heat of the moment. Worse it suggests that the hero is a hysteric from the outset. Advertisement I ts almost criminal the way the central relationship of High Fidelity has been left such a void. Laura the yuppie lawyer whos meant to embody what Rob really needs--warmth true intimacy a sense of permanence--is played by Iben Hjejle a Danish actress who was powerfully sexy as a prostitute-turned-domestic in Mifune. I almost cant believe its the same person here The bloom is gone. Why import a sultry Danish actress starch her up and force her to speak with an American accent that shuts down her personality even further? Werent there any American actresses to humiliate? Cusack ends up having a much jollier rapport with the ""shallow"" lovers Zeta-Jones who seems merrily intoxicated by her own gorgeousness and Lili Taylor who in a few brief moments transforms geeky longing into poetry. He seems happier still with Lauras hostile friend played by his sister Joan Cusack whom he resembles more closely every year Theyre the most comfortable match in the movie. Only poor Laura--the supposed ideal partner--seems out of the loop. There is a quartet of screenwriters--Cusack D.V. DeVincentis Steve Pink and Scott Rosenberg--but none of those 40 fingers is on the emotional pulse of the material and the only time theres no narration is when it actually would come in handy. One of the most memorable scenes in the book features a sulky Rob slipping out of Lauras fathers funeral and then hiding from her car by leaping into a muddy flower bed. Its his most tarnished hour ""Every time I think I have got to the bottom"" Hornby writes ""I find a new way to sink even lower but I know that this is the worst and that whatever happens to me from now on however poor or stupid or single I get these few minutes will remain with me as a shining cautionary beacon."" In the movie Cusack emerges into a deluge of biblical proportions the flower bed in which he throws himself is a virtual lake and Laura calls out to him as soon as he splashes down. The key to his bottoming out--the prolonged sodden agony of his humiliation--is traded for lame slapstick. The best scenes in High Fidelity are not the most confessional ones (the glory of Hornby) but the ones that play like Saturday Night Live sketches. Cusacks Rob owns a secondhand record store Championship Vinyl thats largely patronized by nerd collectors the kind of misshapen young men who know the price of every old LP and take fetishistic pleasure in slipping the platters out of their sleeves and eyeballing their grooves. This is the quintessential perpetual-adolescent setting the sort of place where boys worry over the minutiae of pop culture while their lives slip away. The scenes are mini-showcases for the actors playing Robs two clerks Jack Black (the heavy guy from Tenacious D) a brash loudmouth who chews out the customers for lousy musical taste or uncool behavior and Todd Louiso a skinny fellow with a shaved head collapsing shoulders and an apparent brain impediment--he takes so long to choose his next word that his dullness seems exponentially multiplied. Its too bad that in his narration Rob talks about the sexual thrill of making compilation tapes for prospective romantic partners but is never shown actually putting one together. (The credits list 59 pop songs but only a couple last more than a few bars.) It would be great to see him actually doing something for someone. High Fidelity makes relentless fun of Lauras new boyfriend (a hilarious Tim Robbins) a yuppie with a sitar-loving Gandhiesque demeanor and were supposed to laugh at him especially hard for fussing over a bowl of homemade tomato sauce. Its lucky that Rob had the advantage of being able to blab in our ears for two hours because the choice might not have otherwise been so easy. That sauce looked pretty tasty.

Starring John Cusack Iben Hjejle Joan Cusack and Tim Robbins. Directed by Stephen Frears. Written by D.V. DeVincentis Steve Pink John Cusack and Scott John Rosenberg. (R. 114 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) When Rob Gordon gets dumped by his girlfriend a gorgeous blond attorney the bottom falls out of his life. Decimated humiliated and wallowing in the lush bog of self-pity Rob thinks back on all the most painful breakups of his life. Played by John Cusack in ""High Fidelity"" which opens today Rob is a chronic loser in love but one of the most articulate entertaining losers well ever meet. When a customer walks into the all-vinyl record store he owns and asks ""Do you have soul?"" Rob only has to look up from his pit of despair and answer weakly ""That all depends."" Based on a 1995 novel by British author Nick Hornby ""High Fidelity"" is a terrific comedy about the way guys of a certain age regard women the charades theyll play to connect and the puppy-dog need that quivers beneath their shell of self-reliance. Romantic sorrow -- and the self-reflexive dramas it inspires -- have rarely been this funny. Cusack whos playing variations on Rob since he made ""The Sure Thing"" at 18 is perfectly cast. Recent movies are full of young actors whose stock in trade is withering sarcasm but Cusack -- whose character is sadder wiser and 35 -- brings intelligence and warmth to post- mod irony. A lot of his dialogue is delivered directly to the camera -- not an easy task -- but Cusack pulls it off. ""High Fidelity"" was directed by British filmmaker Stephen Frears who worked with Cusack on ""The Grifters"" a decade ago. Together theyve transposed Hornbys story from London to working-class Chicago. Cusack a Chicago native co-wrote the film with D.V. DeVincentis and Steve Pink his collaborators on ""Grosse Pointe Blank."" Although its primarily about the perils of love ""High Fidelity"" is secondarily about pop music. Rob owns Championship Vinyl and his employees timid Dick (Todd Louiso) and overbearing Barry (Jack Black) are fellow music snobs. Music is the language in their lives the measure by which they define themselves and mark the significant events of their lives. Blindsided when his girlfriend Laura (Danish actress Iben Hjejle) cuts the cord Rob flashes back on his pantheon of lost loves stretching all the way back to his first crush at 13. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays one of them a self-absorbed beauty and the great Lili Taylor another a sad chump whose loneliness mirrors Robs current condition. Lisa Bonet also pops up as a local singer Cusacks sister Joan Cusack plays a friend and Tim Robbins has a great part as Ian the faux-holy ponytail-wearing phony who catches Hjejles eye. These actors have relatively small parts but seem to be having a blast. None however is as impressive or endearing as Cusack. Its about time this wonderful actor is recognized for his gifts. -- Advisory This movie contains rough language and sexual situations. ..

John Cusack is wonderful as a Chicago record-store owner who obsessively reviews his romantic failures in a fresh and quirky adaptation of Nick Hornbys cult novel directed by Stephen Frears.Running time 114 minutes. Rated R. At the Criterion Lincoln Square Orpheum others. MOVIE critics tend to overpraise studio movies that dont feel like the product of a marketing committee -- but the quirky ""High Fidelity"" really deserves being called the first must-see movie of the century. John Cusack a gifted performer whos one of Hollywoods keenest judges of material follows his triumph in ""Being John Malkovich"" with a quite different but only slightly less twisted comic tale of obsession -- with love and popular music. Cusacks Rob Gordon owns Championship Vinyl a sparsely patronized record shop where he and his staff pass most of the day compulsively compiling Top 5 lists of songs from the 60s to the present -- first cuts on first albums songs about death etc. Robs compulsiveness only escalates when his neglected live-in girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle) leaves him for a ponytailed lawyer (a priceless Tim Robbins) -- and thoughtfully quotes him odds on a reconciliation (9 percent). Rob places her on his list of Top 5 breakups -- ""No. 5 with a bullet"" in other words moving rapidly up the charts in Billboard magazines lexicon. Urged on by Bruce Springsteen -- yes the film-shy Boss in a movie however briefly -- in a fantasy visit Rob decides to look up his ex-girlfriends to see why hes been stuck in the same groove of romantic failure. Though his recollections and re-encounters with these women -- among them Lili Taylor and Catherine Zeta-Jones -- are hilarious director Stephen Frears is on to something much more interesting than a male version of the 70s chick flick ""Old Boyfriends."" ""High Fidelity"" is a brilliantly modulated character study revolving around its subject -- how men use their obsessions (records movies sports) to shield them from true intimacy -- like one of Robs beloved discs. Cusack an expert in tortured romantics since ""The Sure Thing"" plays Rob as petty jealous and self-absorbed. Hes utterly miserable and clueless about why he cant connect with the women in his life who also include Lisa Bonet and Natasha Gregson Wagner (in knowing cameos as a Frampton-covering wannabe-diva and a rock journalist respectively) and real-life sister Joan Cusack as his on-screen sister. ""High Fidelity"" which has a fantastic 59-song soundtrack falls short of four stars because of leading lady Hjejle who can also be seen in ""Mifune"" an import from her native Denmark. Shes a beautiful and arresting presence but she and Cusack lack chemistry together and at times its painfully obvious shes struggling with lines in a language not her own. The real discoveries are the hulking Jack Black and pasty-faced Todd Luiso as Robs demented employees a Laurel and Hardy-ish pair of music snobs who violently argue over such arcane matters as the influence of Stiff Little Fingers on Green Day. Black the lead singer for cult band Tenacious D has a massive physical presence that recalls John Belushi. He expresses nothing but pity for anyone who doesnt own an original copy of ""Blonde on Blonde."" Four writers (including Cusack and his screenwriter collaborators on ""Grosse Point Blank"") are credited with this inventive adaptation of Nick Hornbys cult novel which was set in London. Cusack and Frears even make the hoary device of a character directly addressing the audience seem fresh. The several fantasy sequences (particularly multiple versions of Robbins visit to the record store) are standouts. ""High Fidelity"" is on my list of Top 5 movies for the year -- with a bullet.

Mostly it exists to give him a place to argue with his employees (a hilariously passive Todd Louiso and a manically aggressive Jack Black) about musical arcana. Rob is the kind of guy whose nostalgic obsessions prevent him from forming lasting relationships. As High Fidelity opens the latest of them Laura (a lovely newcomer named Iben Hjejle) is packing her bags. This causes Rob to start making a list of his most haunting breakups beginning back in grade school. He and his music- store buddies are like that; theyd rather make lists (mainly about the pop past) than do something fresh with their lives. In other words High Fidelity of which Cusack is also a co-writer and producer is a comedy born of depression. Based on Nick Hornbys novel High Fidelity takes the form of an intermittent monologue at once glum and knowing done directly to the camera. Cusacks Rob leads us in and out of various scenes from his sad past and his various current efforts to come to grips with it. This is a daring strategy the potential for boredom is large. But Cusack is awfully good at calm desperation (or is it barely suppressed frenzy?). We await with suspenseful impatience his finally taking arms against his sea of troubles. Cusack goes back to the marvelous Grosse Pointe Blank with some of the writers to The Grifters with director Stephen Frears to the cradle with his sister Joan who plays a smart tart role here. That could have resulted in a kind of hermetic insiderism--a desire to break each other up and leave us out of the joke. Instead they have made something that we can all laugh at--sometimes raucously sometimes tenderly often ruefully.

"High Fidelity | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; high-fidelity ) High Fidelity (United States 2000) A movie review by James Berardinelli Even in his early roles like a supporting part in John Hughes Sixteen Candles and the male lead in Rob Reiners delightful The Sure Thing there was something idiosyncratic about John Cusacks work. Recently however this quality has become more pronounced with eccentric interpretations of characters in Grosse Pointe Blank This Is My Father (a memorable cameo) Pushing Tin and Being John Malkovich. One of the things that makes Cusack interesting is that his characters always seem to have overdosed on caffeine. Rob Gordon the protagonist of High Fidelity is no exception. If theres such a thing as a prototypical ""Cusack character"" Rob fits the mold. Based on the novel by Nick Hornby High Fidelity is a quirky comedy that explores the romantic misfortunes of the main character. Rob is the owner of ""Championship Vinyl"" a music store that specializes in lps. Along with his assistants belligerent Barry (Jack Black) and meek Dick (Todd Louiso) Rob does his best to keep his shop afloat even though its barely making enough for him to keep him off welfare. Rob is a neurotic and he obsesses over his lackluster romantic history. Fond of making Top 5 lists Rob has recently composed his ""Top 5 all-time break-ups"" and he re-lives each of them in his head from a high-school sweetheart he kissed under the bleachers to the beautiful Charlie (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who is even more self-absorbed than Rob. His latest loss however has hit Rob the hardest because he belatedly realized she may have been ""the one."" Her name is Laura (Iben Hjejle) and after growing weary of Robs general listlessness and unwillingness to commit she decided to leave him and move in with a former neighbor new wave guru Ian (Tim Robbins). As far as the plot goes there really isnt one - High Fidelity is a movie driven by characters (Robs in particular) and situational comedy. A significant portion of the film takes place in the record store and its there that High Fidelity shines with Barry verbally abusing ignorant customers and Dick shyly making advances towards a girl (Sara Gilbert) he finds attractive. For the most part Rob stays in the background during these scenes watching bemusedly as his two cohorts conduct business. He comments that he cant fire them because he ""hired [them] for 3 days a week  then they started showing up every morning - that was 4 years ago."" Rob is going through a mid-life crisis and is trying to analyze why his romantic history has more craters in it than the moons surface. As a form of therapy he decides to see as many of his old girlfriends as he can but that approach doesnt really work. He also tries a fling with a local musician (Lisa Bonet) but he ends up feeling used when she reveals she was only interested in the sex. Ultimately for Rob it all comes back to Laura and she is determined to sever any remaining connections with him. However he takes heart when he manages to wring the concession from here that theres a ""nine percent"" chance of their getting back together. The humor throughout High Fidelity is wry and witty although rarely uproarious. The best scene features three very different takes on a record store confrontation between Rob and Ian. Theres also a lot of fourth wall breaking (perhaps too much) with Cusack frequently taking time to address the camera directly. At the films helm is British-born Stephen Frears the director of such notable productions as Dangerous Liaisons and The Snapper. Frears who has always embraced peculiar stories that highlight rapier-sharp wit with occasional non-intrusive social commentary brings an offbeat rhythm to High Fidelity. On the surface the storyline may not be all that original (and it isnt) but Frears tweaks it in such a manner that it seems fresh and welcome. Cusack is supported by a high profile group of actors. Aside from Todd Louiso and Jack Black who play the Laurel and Hardy of ""Championship Vinyl"" the biggest part belongs to Iben Hjejle who is using High Fidelity as her entrance into the American market. Hjejle is as fetching here as she was in the recent Mifune and she speaks English with only the barest trace of an accent. Lili Taylor and Catherine Zeta-Jones have small parts as Robs former girlfriends. Johns sister Joan (a frequent guest in her brothers movies) plays Robs gal pal Liz who is supportive of him until Laura tells her a few unsavory details about why the breakup occurred. Theres no deep meaning to High Fidelity although it occasionally toys with the importance of pop music to a persons psychological development. At one point early in the film Rob muses ""Did I listen to pop music because I was miserable or was I miserable because I listened to pop music?"" Theres more than a hint of Woody Allen in the project from the neuroses of the main character to the Annie Hall-type dissection of a failed romance but without the stigma that some movie-goers attach to anything Allen does. Because of its quirky characters smart dialogue and occasional bursts of penetrating humor High Fidelity stands out as a ""small"" motion picture that deserves wide exposure.

"Cusacks Always Real In`fidelity - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Movies.Cusacks Always Real In`fidelityMarch 31 2000|By Mark Caro Tribune Movie Writer.John Cusack and his co-writers have solved the problem of how to transfer the snappy narrative of Nick Hornbys novel ""High Fidelity"" to the screen They have Cusack playing an angsty Chicago record-store owner named Rob recite passages into the camera.Cusack somehow pulls it off. His great gift as an actor is that you accept him as real -- smart yet flawed and more likable for it -- so when hes relating to you Robs top five most memorable girlfriend breakups you appreciate his leveling with you."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""300"" height=""160""gt;Cusacks Rob has been dumped by his girlfriend Laura (Danish actress Iben Hjejle)and feels that early-30s-male singles compulsion to revisit his romantic history.He owns Championship Vinyl a record store that is still a record store and his two employees are the pale soft-spoken Dick (Todd Louiso in an understated original performance) and the brash overtly snobby Barry (the demon-eyed Jack Black whose hamminess at first a bit much proves highly enjoyable). Theyre guys who love making lists and arguing over them such as the five best opening songs on albums and their mania for categorizing spills over into other areas as well; their chief operating principle is ""What you like matters more than what youre like.""Hornbys novel -- and the movie -- not only capture this particularly male need to stick everything into categories but also the notion that doing so is a way of closing oneself off to the worlds surprises. For Rob to grow up he must come up with a different more generous way of judging others and himself.British director Stephen Frears provides the same kind of streamlined sympathetic direction that he brought to his adaptations of the Roddy Doyle novels ""The Snapper"" and ""The Van."" Like the director the London-set novel has made the transition to Chicago with ease.The movies characters and locations certainly ring true. Rob lives and works in Wicker Park wears a Wax Trax T-shirt hangs out at the clubs Lounge Ax and the Double Door and refers to used-record stores such as Vintage Vinyl (in Evanston). Rob has decided the path to self-knowledge includes visits with his former girlfriends who provide the amusing -- and to him revelatory -- answers to his what-if questions.The parade of exes includes Lili Taylor as a partner in mutual rebounding and Catherine Zeta-Jones as a model whose fabulous looks always intimidated Rob.The movie also features Tim Robbins in a funny bit part as Robs Zen-like romantic rival; Joan Cusack as Lauras friend; and Lisa Bonet as a singer named Marie De Salle.Where ""High Fidelity"" goes slightly out of tune is in the central relationship between Rob and Laura and its resolution. Hjejle is a fresh screen presence -- she comes across as a real person of a kind youve never seen before -- but you dont quite get what makes her tick or why she and Rob truly belong or dont belong together.Nevertheless this isnt one of those overgeneralized romantic comedies; Rob may be an Everyman (as the press kit claims) but hes a specific one well-written and well-acted. In some ways Rob is like an adult Lloyd Dobler from ""Say Anything""; he even stands in the rain proclaiming his desire."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""300"" height=""110""gt;Rob may have a self-loathing streak but Cusack never portrays him as a victim or whiner. Addressing the camera after a one-night stand he shrugs sheepishly but without apologies -- a guy copping to guy-like misbehavior.Such candor about male-female relationships though perhaps not mindblowing is nonetheless rare particularly in a movie that aims to entertain more than educate (and succeeds). Occasionally broad but rarely less than intelligent ""High Fidelity"" easily cracks the top five list of reasons to go to the movies these days -- and defies categories in doing so.""HIGH FIDELITY""(star) (star) (star)Directed by Stephen Frears; written by D.V.
