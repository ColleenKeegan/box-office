"Finding Australias Lost Gold proves elusive - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Finding Australias Lost Gold proves elusive Australias Lost Gold The Legend of Lasseter Level 33 Bob Lasseter now 87 in the documentary ""Australias Lost Gold The Legend of Lasseter."" Bob Lasseter now 87 in the documentary ""Australias Lost Gold The Legend of Lasseter."" (Level 33) Michael Rechtshaffen The intriguing documentary ""Australias Lost Gold"" sets out to get to the bottom of the legend of Harold Lasseter a prospector who died of starvation in the harsh Central Australian desert in 1931 shortly after purportedly discovering the mother lode in a quartz reef that has never been located.But the deeper director Luke Walker digs the further he seems to be from getting a handle on the man whose exploits have often been recounted in print on film and even in song. Using Lasseters 80-year-old diary as his guide along with Lasseters tireless son Bob now 87 who has spent his life in search of the grouping of hills resembling ""three women in sun bonnets"" said to contain the phantom booty Walker commences his ambitious quest. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story Poring through shelves and shelves of historic archives and talking to those who knew people who knew Harold Lasseter the filmmaker attempts to retrace Lasseters ill-fated journey -- one that places him in the vicinity of a sacred Aboriginal location that might have prevented Lasseter from reaching his objective. The film like Walkers trek occasionally feels like a bit of a slog to those unexposed to the folklore but it makes some interesting observations in regard to the pursuit of fact over fiction. At its most absorbing Lasseters story plays like an Aussie ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" in which the main subject is a bit of a cypher whose true nature proves to be as difficult to pinpoint as that elusive gold.---------------Australias Lost Gold Not ratedRunning time 1 hour 41 minutesPlaying Arena Cinema Hollywood Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined TV viewership for Hillary Clintons acceptance speech is smaller than Donald Trumps Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad78deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-mini-australias-lost-gold-review-20160524-snap-story.html#nt=oft03a-1la1,200,australia0,australia,latimes
