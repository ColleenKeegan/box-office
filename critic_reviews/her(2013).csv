""Here Come the Video Freex"" includes footage from free lancers who covered events of the late 1960s and early 70s. Photo Long Shot Factory Video Freex interesting look at pioneer journalists 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Imagine if hordes of hippies in the late 1960s had iPhones that could shoot grainy black-and-white videos and you get the gist of the engaging documentary ""Here Come the Video Freex."" Of course there were no iPhones back then but there were Sony Portapaks the first handheld video cameras -- and enterprising young idealists used these devices to record countercultural events that were being sanitized (or ignored altogether) by the nations media. The work of these freelance video journalists never found its way to the airwaves of the major television networks. But directors Jon Nealon and Jenny Raskin have rounded up some remarkable footage and threaded it together in a concise interesting way. The decades-old videos as expected do not have sophisticated production values but they are of historic importance an interview with Abbie Hoffman during the trial of the Chicago Eight; a chat with Black Panther Fred Hampton only weeks before he was murdered in his sleep in Chicago; and an adventurous visit to the Republican National Convention in 1972. The renegade band of journalists also visits Woodstock and a womens liberation event in New York. Its like were seeing a home movie except this home movie is taking us on a whirlwind tour through the late 1960s and early 1970s. One of the most memorable sequences involves a war protest in Washington where the freelance videographers witness violence and mayhem. Unlike the staid newscasts of the day these images are charged with tension. The main thing lacking in ""Here Come the Video Freex"" is the broader context These video journalists were way ahead of their time but the documentary barely touches on where these freelancers fit into journalistic history. The pioneers featured in the film seem too close to the situation to give us a sense of their legacy. For the most part though the videos speak for themselves -- and provide a worthwhile time capsule of a turbulent era. David Lewis is a Bay Area freelance writer. Here Come the Videofreex Documentary. Directed by Jon Nealon and Jenny Raskin. (Not rated. 79 minutes.) To see a trailer go to www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU82nETXer8.

""If it wasnt for the law wed win easy"" Abbie Hoffman laughs in the early days of the Chicago Seven trial. Theres scrums at peace protests and an African-American activist speaking tough truths to white feminists who dont seem interested in her concerns; theres New Yorkers in a meeting just after Roe v. Wade discussing the practicalities and prices of abortion. ""I never hit a girl in my life but theres always a first time"" a dude cracks at a feminist rally. Fred Hampton of the Chicago Black Panthers spews fire on the topic of not disarming -- just a couple of weeks before his assassination. A wisp-bearded young man at Woodstock holds forth about the ""shitty job"" his parents generation did raising kids; another guy sits with a lamb in his lap proclaiming that his generation is one big family opposed to murder even of animals. ""You shouldnt turn your stomach into a grave"" he says. Film DetailsCritics Pick Here Come the Videofreex RatingNR GenreDocumentary Running Time79 min. More Info Trailer All that (and more so much more) makes Jon Nealon and Jenny Raskins Here Come the Videofreex cant-miss viewing for culture heads. For all that the films narrative -- the Freex story told through latter-day interviews -- plays like some counter-endorsement of the freeform-style video screenings the collective used to hold at the Loft in the early Seventies or of the pirate TV station they ran upstate starting in 74 The staid programmatic techniques of todays doc filmmaking run counter to the revolution of what these kids shot.

Credit Long Shot Factory The 1968 introduction of a record-playback model of the Sony Portapak which yoked a video camera to a video recorder in a lightweight format was without a doubt seminal in media history. For various counterculture idealists the relatively affordable low-resolution devices had utopian truth-telling potential. ""Here Come the Videofreex"" a concise and informative documentary directed by Jon Nealon and Jenny Raskin tells the story of one such collective.The Portapak early adopters David Cort and Parry Teasdale stumble upon each other at Woodstock both of them recording ""none of the music"" and instead capturing possibly incriminating (in retrospect) pronouncements from shaggy baby boomers. (One hippie drawls that ""the parents of the past generation have"" made a mess of their kids -- the hippie actually uses a barnyard epithet to describe what theyve done -- and one has every confidence that this individual has since heard something similar or worse from his own children or grandchildren by now.) With some like-minded friends and lovers Mr. Cort and Mr. Teasdale created the Videofreex collective. An alliance with media giant CBS is pursued and proves abortive but not before the Videofreex capture some galvanizing footage including an interview with Fred Hampton the Illinois chairman of the Black Panther Party conducted weeks before Hampton was killed by the police in 1969.The tools of portable video were such the members recall that men and women started at the same learning curve and women were able to cover the feminist movement in great detail. As financing and transmitting concerns mount the movie sees the collective mutating from activists to educators and community entertainers. The utopia they envisioned has yet to materialize to say the least but seeing their efforts is heartening.""Here Come the Videofreex"" is not rated. Running time 1 hour 19 minutes.
