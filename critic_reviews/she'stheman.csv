Comments Shes the Man Twelfth Night joins the growing list of Shakespeare plays updated for modern teens on the theory that theyll be led back to the Bard which is like feeding someone Pringles and hoping hell develop a taste for vichyssoise. In this version Viola (Amanda Bynes) is a high school soccer player who disguises herself as her twin brother and takes his place at his new boarding school to prove she can compete with the guys. Pursuing a PG-13 director Andy Fickman mostly soft-pedals the plays homosexual panic generating a comedy that lacks both the verbal sophistication of its source and the sexual sophistication of its target audience.

"Shes the Man | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; she-s-the-man ) Shes the Man (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli ""Be not afraid of greatness some are born great some achieve greatness and some have greatness thrust upon them"". - Twelfth Night Act II Scene V That single quotation and a few of the names and plot points are all that remain of Shakespeare in this ""updated"" version of Twelfth Night. Theres a Viola a Duke Orsino an Olivia and a Sebastian. Somehow however I dont remember there being a ""Coach Dinklage"" or a ""Principal Gold"" in the original. Maybe the version I read was the abridged onea| As was proven with 10 Things I Hate about You (written by Karen McCullah Luzt and Kristen Smith two of the co-scribes of this picture) it is possible to re-imagine the Bard in a modern high school setting but Shes the Man doesnt do it well. First-time director Andy Fickman is too concerned with juvenile sit-com level humor. With all the gender bending one could envision the potential for a high school sex farce but the PG-13 rating eliminates the most intriguing possibilities. So we get all the expected things PG-13 movies deliver nudity hidden from the cameras view innuendo that only a prude would consider risquA(c) and homosexuality as a punch-line. At least the 1980s teen sex comedies (which this resembles in all the worst ways) had the decency to deliver. All Shes the Man does is tease. If youre familiar with Twelfth Night you probably wont recognize much of it here. Illyria is now a school Duke is a first name and the screenwriters didnt have the guts to name anyone Toby Belch. (Although the name in itself probably would have been more amusing than half of what passes for comedy.) Nearly every joke in the film is a re-tread of something we have seen before. Why does a ""boy"" have tampons in his luggage? How will ""he"" cope with taking showers in an all-boys dorm? What happens when the shy girl with glasses and braces gets a chance to let loose? If theres comic potential in these concepts Shes the Man fails to discover it. Instead it drags out scenes that would make Bosom Buddies look sophisticated. Viola (Amanda Bynes) is a soccer-playing girl who is at loose ends when her school cuts the girls soccer program. So she does what any self-respecting young woman would do impersonate her brother who happens to be about to start at another school where no one knows him. And as luck would have it brother Sebastian (James Kirk - no Star Trek jokes here but who would name their kid that?) is off in London pursuing his dream of being a musician. So Viola gets started at the new school and falls in love with her hunky roommate Duke (Channing Tatum). Alas Duke is interested in Olivia (Laura Ramsey) who has in turn fallen for Viola. And just wait until the real Sebastian shows up home a day early from overseas. Meanwhile the R. Lee Ermy role is filled by Vinnie Jones who plays the soccer coach who never smiles. But his high decibel tirades are much ado about nothing. And alls well that ends well. Its easy enough to suspend disbelief about the premise even though Amanda Bynes never comes close to looking like a boy. But when the script calls for the inclusion of characters like Violas freaky mother (Julie Hagerty whose portrayal is more shrill than nails on a chalk board) and Illyrias creepy principal (David Cross trying to make pedophiles funny) it goes too far. Some audience members will ignore this extraneous stuff and focus exclusively on Viola. Thats the best approach to getting through the movie because Bynes is better than the material. Unfunny accent aside she has screen presence and a good sense of comic timing. She saves a few of the gags and her delivery hints at a self-awareness that the director may not have intended. The target audience is teenage girls (the core of Bynes fan base) and theyll probably have fun with the movie. However Shes the Man is neither smart enough nor funny enough to have cross-over appeal to any other demographic. Its not a complete wash out - a few of the jokes work Bynes is engaging and theres a certain masochistic enjoyment in seeing how badly the Bard can be bludgeoned. But the laundry list of things Shes the Man does badly is too long to recount. Some movies are born great some achieve greatness and some have greatness thrust upon them. For Shes the Man the answer to the multiple choice question is (d) none of the above.

Image 1of/1 CaptionClose Image 1 of 1 - - Photo Photos By Rob McEwan. Twelfth Night gets booted into teen soccer turf 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Shes the Man Teen comedy. Starring Amanda Bynes Channing Tatum Laura Ramsey James Kirk and Julie Hagerty. Directed by Andy Fickman. (Rated PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Cliff Notes are getting some serious competition from movie spin-offs of the classics. Why labor over those cheat sheets wrapped in a familiar yellow cover when it is like so much easier to watch the flick. Need a painless plot summary of ""Emma"" or ""The Taming of the Shrew""? Rent ""Clueless"" or ""10 Things I Hate About You."" Now just in time for students struggling with ""Twelfth Night"" comes ""Shes the Man"" a contemporary retelling of Shakespeares gender-bending comedy. The movie cleverly weaves in many of the Bards characters retaining their names - Olivia Sebastian and Viola sound like what rich people actually might call their kids these days -- and the plays central conceit of a girl attempting to pass as a boy. ""Shes the Man"" has a certain charm and is sure to appeal to tweens at least the female variety. Its primary asset is the adorable Amanda Bynes in the role of the heroine Viola who pretends to be her twin brother in order to play soccer after the girls team at her school is disbanded. Kudos to screenwriters Ewan Leslie Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith (who wrote ""10 Things"") for coming up with the soccer angle -- its very au courant. Bynes displays a flair for comedy especially when Viola studies guys walking down the street and mimics their gait and mannerisms. Bynes uses her elastic face to show Violas every thought making the transition and doing her darnedest to pull it off. When a soccer ball hits her in her private parts Bynes expresses Violas momentary confusion followed by an overreaction to pain she doesnt feel. Shes not going to win an Oscar for playing a boy as Hilary Swank did; but Bynes makes a far more convincing one than Barbra Streisand in ""Yentl."" An inexplicable casting decision however foils Bynes best efforts and comes close to ruining the movie. Shes a good 4 inches shorter and 50 pounds lighter than the beefy James Kirk who plays twin brother Sebastian. While hes in London she enrolls at a new school under his name. Her acceptance there is marginally plausible because of the efforts she makes to disguise herself including wearing a Beatles-like wig and because no one at Illyria Prep (cleverly named for the kingdom in ""Twelfth Night"") has laid eyes on Sebastian. But when he unexpectedly shows up on campus its hard to buy that none of his fellow students notice the changes in him. As Shakespeare well knew audiences can suspend disbelief only so far and the obliviousness of even his roommate Duke (Channing Tatum) takes you out of the movie. Almost as distracting is the age of most of the actors cast as preppies. Theyre too old and sophisticated looking to pass for high schoolers. Kirk is out of the picture most of the time and doesnt make much of an impression even when hes in it. But Tatum last seen in ""Coach Carter"" is a find. Hes both incredibly good looking and a good enough actor to convey Dukes confusion at the feelings he has for Viola when he thinks shes Sebastian. Julie Hagerty -- fondly remembered by a slightly older generation as the spacey stewardess in ""Airplane"" -- has a small role as the twins hoity-toity mother. She doesnt get to do much except act uptight but its still nice to see her. Director Andy Fickman keeps the action moving though most of the heavy lifting is done by the screenwriting team which works in ""Twelfth Nights"" most famous speech about some being born great and the way others achieve it. The words are spoken by Duke during a pep talk to Viola/Sebastian before a soccer game. Its not giving away too much to say the gender identity thing gets straightened out and everybody ends up with the person she or he is supposed to. Alls well that ends well as someone once said. -- Advisory Mild sexual references Most Popular 1 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 2 Cops Son of billionaire former supermodel arrested after... 3 Ann Coulter Hammered by Conservatives for Smearing US War... 4 Dear Abby I dont want anyone to know that Ive retired 5 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 6 Inmate charged in 2015 quadruple slaying in S.F. 7 33 signs youre living in the San Francisco bubble 8 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed 9 Police Girl 14 slits teens throat in hope of first kill 10 San Francisco ranks surprisingly low on the list of 20 Most...

Who else could write plays that a) last 400 years b) withstand endless interpretations and c) include the line ""Take her and kiss her and kiss the crap outta her"" Like I said you gotta love Shakespeare even if he didnt write that last thing about taking and kissing etc. Nor did he write a soliloquy involving this poetic turn ""Like I dont know stuff. Whatever stuff there is."" Im also pretty sure he never penned a scene in which the heroine checks out all sorts of male babeage in a locker room. But I digress. Here we have Shes the Man a contempo-girly adaptation of Twelfth Night that involves a plucky teen named Viola (Amanda Bynes) who fakes being a boy to play soccer at her brothers snooty prep school. While there Viola accidentally falls for Duke her brothers hunky roommate (Channing Tatum) and even more accidentally makes Olivia Dukes hot blonde crush (Laura Ramsey) fall in love with her. Thats not all. While pretending to be her brother she breaks up with her brothers harpy girlfriend (Alex Breckenridge) fends off her own jerk ex-boyfriend (Robert Hoffman) and engages strangely with the schools buffoonish principal (David Cross). While attending a carnival as her brother she zips into a port-a-potty changes back into Viola and successfully makes out with Duke in the kissing booth. And thats still not all but I have to stop somewhere. Shes the Man retains much of Twelfth Nights discombobulation and many of its names but is aimed unlike the original at the cherry-lip-gloss demographic. Four members of this young female subset watched the movie with me and reported back enthusiastically agreeing that the heroine has spirit (their word) that the hunky roommate lacks self-expression (again their word) and that the guys playing the hunky roommate and the jerk ex-boyfriend ought to have switched roles because the guy playing the jerks a better actor. Touche on all points. They also agreed and I must confirm that Bynes does not repeat not absolutely not look like a boy not even a eunuch not even when shes wearing a bad Beatles tribute wig and smushing her voice down to an alto. This would be a problem for the movies realism except that ""Shakespearean comedy"" and ""realism"" dont exactly go hand-in-hand -- and back in the day some hairy Elizabethan guy probably played Viola. Much easier for him to ""fake"" being a boy hmmm? Anyway Bynes is fine by me. A bona fide star on Nickelodeon she has an amusing tart-sarcastic ploy and an arsenal of eye-rolls and lip-twists that betray no fear of overacting -- an underrated skill set in my book. The role is absurd a fact she seems to recognize with joyful abandonment and the movie benefits on the whole from a certain buzzy recklessness. If director Andy Fickman (who made the madcap irreverent Reefer Madness The Movie Musical) cant quite lift Shes the Man to the exalted pinnacle of Shakespeare adaptations it does make room for itself alongside such hormonal retakes as 10 Things I Hate About You (The Taming of the Shrew) and O (Othello). So OK did Violas cell phone ring Barbie Girl when the curtain first rose at the Globe? Nah. And no one wearing pantaloons cracked on opening night ""Inside every girl theres a boy -- that came out wrong but you know what I mean."" My little focus group didnt get that joke (thank God) but I did.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post ""Shes the Man"" is a drawn-out sitcom that not only jumps the shark it dresses the shark in drag has a dolphin fall in love with the shark and turns the shark into sushi. But then Shakespeare did the same ridiculous things to his plot in ""Twelfth Night"" centuries before sitcoms had to come up with ""very special"" episodes to keep an audience watching through 10 seasons - witness the infamous ""Happy Days"" episode where Fonzie jumped a shark tank with his motorcycle marking the shows creative death. ""Shes the Man"" modeled on that gender-bending Shakespeare masterpiece is harmless fun for the 12-year-olds who should make up the core audience. Its refreshing frankly to see a PG-13 movie about high school girls that doesnt spit all over its rating; ""Shes the Man"" is a very soft PG-13 and will not make parental escorts squirm with regret. Teen TV star Amanda Bynes is Viola Hastings a pretty jock who has just been informed that Cornwall High School eliminated the girls soccer team she starred on. When the coach refuses to let her try out for the boys team Viola takes the only illogical step afforded her by the screenplay She will dress as a boy and play soccer for crosstown rival Illyria High School taking the spot in the dorm vacated by her brother when his band tours Europe. With me? Stay close those sharks are everywhere Viola secretly falls in love with her male roommate (Channing Tatum) who asks advice for winning the hand of Olivia (Laura Ramsey) who finds herself falling for the sensitive boy that Viola pretends to be. These made-for-TV Shakespearean hijinks guarantee a few set pieces including the one where Viola - and the brother she is playing - are required to be at the same place at the same time. Cue multiple costume changes and since were all meeting at a carnival one change naturally must occur inside a Tilt-a-Whirls tea cup. Thank you for inquiring but no realism is not a requirement. Bynes may be the least believable cross-dresser since Tom Hanks suited up for the other team in ""Bosom Buddies."" But shes game and understands the actors trick of retreating to inherent cuteness amid the slings and arrows of superficiality. Yes there will be a mustache-fitting montage a few awkward shower scenes and a clueless principal. We know what were in for with a glorified after-school special like ""Shes the Man"" so theres not much use complaining. It wont be we must hope the best teen movie of the year. But then again ""Twelfth Night"" wasnt Shakespeares best play either.

Shes the Man Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2006) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/shes-the-man-2006,200,she'stheman11,she'stheman,rogerebert
"Bynes as a boy amusingly makes the Man - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Bynes as a boy amusingly makes the Man By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  March 17 2006 Im not that familiar with the ins and outs of Title IX but if one minute I were on a girls varsity soccer team and the next minute the team suddenly male-chauvinistically didnt exist Id round up the other girls up for some sort of class-action suit.Viola the miffed soccer heroine Amanda Bynes plays in her new movie has a nuttier idea. She dumps her boyfriend and joins a rival schools team disguised as her twin brother.The ensuing shenanigans are cataloged in Shes the Man"" a screwball comedy that made me wish I were 13 again because this is precisely the kind of movie I would have gone nuts for in the ninth grade. I probably wouldnt have known to care that the movie crams William Shakespeares Twelfth Night"" into a generic American prep school. I would have just laughed at Byness boy drag which makes her look like a Little Rascal with Irina Slutskayas haircut.Viola enrolls at Illyria Prep when her brother Sebastian (James Kirk) sneaks off to London for 12 days to play with his band and asks her to cover for him. But Violas craftier than that. To become Sebastian"" she enlists her friends one of whom happens to be a stylist with a confusing resemblance to Jude Law. At Illyria the disguised Viola meets her brothers roommate Duke (Channing Tatum) who notices the tampons in Sebastians shoe. (Theyre for nosebleeds.) Later the balding headmaster (David Cross of all people) catches Viola scratching her wig and they have a heart-to-heart about coming to terms with hair loss.On her mild WB sitcom What I Like About You"" Bynes pretty much plays it straight but this movie is a license for outlandishness. She delivers a male impersonation thats a hilarious mockery of white suburban masculinity and what a blank slate it can be. In the same sentence sometimes in the same word Sebastian sounds like a stoned hip-hop beach bum and a theater queen voicing lines like You know it brah"" Initially Duke and the rest of the team find Sebastians shtick annoying. But after Viola and her stylist concoct a scenario in which two of her hot girlfriends pretend to be obsessed with Sebastian Duke and the boys worship the impostor. They remain understandably perplexed by his voices shifting tone and how a soccer ball to the crotch doesnt faze him.The movie might take the Cliffs Notes approach to Shakespeare (the script is smart the direction lousy) but the navigation of high-school social politics is refreshingly direct. Shes the Man"" says some funny and true things about who is OK to like and whos not. It also happily undercuts its stock characters by threatening to turn them into recognizable people. Duke looks like the quintessential conceited pretty-boy jock but whenever Olivia (Laura Ramsey) is around he turns to spineless goop.Olivia doesnt want him though. She apparently prefers her men a little more androgynous and makes a play for Sebastian. Viola meanwhile is falling for Duke and still has to maintain her day job as a reluctant debutante. ""Shes the Man"" follows Clueless"" O"" and 10 Things I Hate About You"" in repurposing literary classics for an American high school setting. 10 Things"" was based on The Taming of the Shrew"" and might be worth revisiting just to see Heath Ledger Julia Stiles and Joseph Gordon-Levitt before they took on riskier roles.Some actors in Shes the Man"" are also probably headed for bigger darker things. But I hope Bynes keep it light a little longer. She gawks mugs struts sashays bugs out flails and apes all while staying pretty cute.

Duke (Channing Tatum) likes Olivia (Laura Ramsey left). But she likes Sebastian who is Viola (Amanda Bynes) posing as a boy. DreamWorks Pictures Loosely based on Twelfth Night its the story of Viola (Amanda Bynes) a perky high school soccer star whose team is eliminated. She makes an impulsive decision to attend her twin brother Sebastians new boarding school disguised as him in order to play soccer against her high school and show the chauvinistic coach that girls can play as well as boys. This plan is meant to last only two weeks. During that time Sebastian (James Kirk) a musician skips off to London. About the movieShes the Man   (out of four) Stars Amanda Bynes Channing Tatum Julie Hagerty David Cross Director Andy Fickman Distributor DreamWorks Rating PG-13 for some sexual material Running time 1 hour 45 minutes Opens Friday nationwide Bynes as Sebastian is assigned a hottie roommate Duke (Channing Tatum) who is pining away for Olivia (Laura Ramsey). To make matters more complicated Olivia pals up with Sebastian and falls for him. Bynes mother (Julie Hagerty) is pushing Viola to be more ladylike and prepare for her coming-out party as a debutante. The siblings are able to pull off this switch because their parents are divorced and each parent thinks the teens are with the other parent. (Its unlikely most parents would pay so little attention to their teenagers whereabouts but disbelief might as well be suspended here.) Bynes goes back to her adorable Viola self for a carnival and meets Duke while manning the kissing booth. Interest sparks. Bynes is not a wholly convincing teenage boy (she looks a bit too feminine) but she has a gift for physical comedy so the conceit works. The school principal played by David Cross is hilarious as a clueless if well-meaning doofus. This is a perfectly pleasant entertaining and often witty romp with engaging performances. However parents of younger children should note the PG-13 rating given its mild sexual content. There also is a bit of exhibitionism (though nothing is shown) as the twins must prove their respective genders to a large crowd. Shes the Man is likable and funny -- think a youthful Tootsie with a dash of Freaky Friday.

Along the way however there will be girl power to the max.On learning that her high school is dropping its girls soccer program the sassy she-jock Viola Hastings (Amanda Bynes) penetrates the boys team by assuming the identity of her twin brother Sebastian (James Kirk). With the help of her stylist sidekick (an uncanny dead ringer for Jude Law named Jonathan Sadowski) Viola butches up into an ambiguous creature who blabbers inappropriate dude-speak with an inscrutable accent (yokel? autistic?) and feels no pain when assaulted in the groin. This befuddles Duke (Channing Tatum) her hunky monosyllabic teammate and will vaguely amuse everyone else.The ensuing complications -- romantic social sporty -- are modeled on ""Twelfth Night"" although the tone of the movie (hysterical peppiness) and style of acting (emphatic grotesquerie) are more suited to campy Off Broadway musicals which is precisely where the director Andy Fickman hails from. Everything projects as if for the benefit of a nearsighted and dimwitted ticket holder at the back of the room. To his credit Mr. Fickman has mastered one device unique to the cinema making repeated use of the corny training montage.NATHAN LEE""Shes the Man"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has schoolyard language and transgender innuendo. Continue reading the main story Were interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think. Whats Next Loading...

"Like So Not the Bard washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Like So Not the Bard Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints Friday March 17 2006 ""Shes the Man"" is another gate-crasher at the lets-do-a-mediocre-update-of-Shakespeare party. In this teen-oriented tribute (is ""tackification"" a word?) of ""Twelfth Night"" Amanda Bynes plays Viola a soccer jock at a prep school whose team is cut for lack of numbers. Laughed off the field when she tries out for the boys team shes determined to give those sexist players their comeuppance. The opportunity presents itself when Violas twin brother Sebastian (James Kirk) decides to blow off his first few weeks at his new school so he can take his rock band to a music contest in London. Disguising herself as Sebastian Viola shows up at her brothers school and joins the school team. Olivia finds herself rooming with and attracted to Duke (Channing Tatum) a jock with six-pack abs and a one-bottle IQ who has eyes only for blonde queen Olivia (Laura Ramsey). But Olivia likes Viola whom she thinks is Sebastian and -- you get the convoluted idea. Byness rubbery expressions -- she seems to be made of tanned putty -- are occasionally funny. But theres no way any human with better than myopic vision couldnt see through her disguise. (If Violas obvious wig and female figure arent enough theres always her high-treble voice which no matter how low she tries to make it sound screams out I am a girl .) For the teen audience this is aimed for none of this will matter. But once again Hollywood makes the mistaken assumption that cribbing Shakespearean plots and dumping the poetry will somehow download the Bards brilliance. -- Desson Thomson Shes the Man PG-13 105 minutes Contains some sexual situations.

Thomas Howell in a tan-from-the-can pretended to be black and was so unconvincing at it that your face curdled into a wince. In Shes the Man Amanda Bynes pastes on sideburns and a shaggy bowl-cut wig and struts around in a prep-school jacket attempting to pass herself off as a boy but Bynes with her chipmunk cheeks and goggly eyes comes off more like some bizarre third sex -- Davy Jones after an infusion of estrogen. When she tries to talk ""masculine"" squeaking out lines like ""Hey bruthuh"" in a vaguely hip-hop patois its so cheesy-wrong that you stare with a mix of fascination and horror. Shes the Man in which Bynes has to pretend to be her brother to play competitive soccer is a role-reversal comedy that has almost too much situational structure -- the whole Twelfth Night thing -- and not enough scurrilous hilarity. As an actress Bynes is wholesome to a fault. She impersonates a teenage boy yet never gives him one good dirty thought.

Pic marks screenwriters Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smiths second venture with the Bard although this one lacks much of the cutting wit of their ""10 Things I Hate About You"" (based on ""The Taming of the Shrew""). The itch to put on a show propels ""Shes the Man"" a spunky if often erratic update of Shakespeares ""Twelfth Night"" to the privileged milieu of contempo American prep schools. Pic marks screenwriters Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smiths second venture with the Bard although this one lacks much of the cutting wit of their ""10 Things I Hate About You"" (based on ""The Taming of the Shrew""). Teen fave Amanda Bynes mightily struggles with a tricky role -which wont for a second depress what should be sparkling opening frame B.O. with solid grades to come in after-school ancillary class. On paper the idea of modernizing ""Twelfth Night"" with its array of attractive young people and a smart if headstrong woman talented at disguising herself as a man is at least as natural as Amy Heckerlings notion a decade ago for turning Jane Austens ""Emma"" into ""Clueless."" Besides all that Lutz and Smith along with co-screenwriter producer and story writer Ewan Leslie and director Andy Fickman are doing is fundamentally no different than what stage directors routinely do with Shakespeare by lifting it out of its original context. Showing off her soccer skills over the opening credits Viola (Bynes) knows she could beat half of the players on the boys squad at Cornwall Prep especially since b.f. Justin (Robert Hoffman) has told her so. Still the school dissolves the girls team and the boys coach dismisses any bid by the girls to try out with the guys. Worse Violas overweening mom Daphne (Julie Hagerty in typically sharp form) insists that her tomboy daughter train for coming out as a debutante. Opportunity strikes however when Violas brother Sebastian (James Kirk) already kicked out of Cornwall and ditching classes at rival Ilyria Prep flees home (and to his supremely bitchy g.f. Monique ushered with gusto by Alex Breckinridge) to play with his rock n roll band at a London festival. Having been told that she resembles her brother -- which is a stretch -- Viola determines to disguise herself as Sebastian and get on the Ilyria boys soccer team to get back at Cornwall. As insistent as its heroine to get its point across ""Shes the Man"" gathers up enough energy and likeable goodwill that it almost skirts past some extremely strained passages in which Bynes plays out being a boy. While her perf rightly preserves Shakespeares joke of her lapsing back from time to time into girlish behavior (with some added soccer-inflected jokes) Bynes exaggerates the boyishness into a cartoon thats not only too broad for the camera but too much for any high school prep jock to take seriously. The movies solution is to insist on a strange suspension of disbelief that never fully asserts itself but the major key to finally making much of it work is the bright and enthusiastic cast centered on the swarthy and magnetic Channing Tatum as Duke Ilyrias star player and Viola-Sebastians roommate. First smitten by cutie Olivia (a charming Laura Ramsey) Duke recruits his roomie -- with ""his"" ability to know what girls want -- to help hook her up with him. Of course Olivia likes Viola-Sebastian and when Duke has a moment in the kissing booth during a carnival with the real Viola hes pulled in another direction. Tatums emotional turns more than Bynes antics drive the pic into interesting comedic territory. ""Shes the Man"" reps a multi-faceted project in itself for school age auds -- not only a way to brush up their Shakespeare and for girls to have a keen rooting interest with one of their favorite tube stars and discover a new heart-throb in Tatum -- but for soccer-hungry kids to soak up some terrific moves on the field. Fickman and lenser Greg Gardiner combine with soccer choreographer Dan Metcalfe to stage some visceral action on the pitch including p.o.v. shots from the angle of players feet.
