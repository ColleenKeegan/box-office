Grieving mother Telly (Julianne Moore) is convinced that the memories of her husband friends and neighbours have been wiped when none of them recalls the death of a planeload of schoolchildren among them her son Sam. Fleeing accusations of insanity she investigates her conspiracy theories with a man she remembers to be a fellow parent. An intriguing premise a strong lead and a confident pace help this tick along but crashingly obvious exposition and dialogue lower the tone. As commercial melodrama this entertains but fails as a conspiracy thriller neglecting plot development in favour of action and analysis in favour of hysteria.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

Moore plays Telly Paretta who is grieving for her 8-year-old son Sam whom she last saw when she put him on an ill-fated plane more than a year before. But lately her psychiatrist Dr. Munce (Gary Sinise) has been telling her no such child ever existed. As for all those memories not to mention photographs baseball gloves and videotapes they amount to self-delusion. Shes nuts. What kid? The strange thing is no one else remembers Sam. Not even Tellys estranged husband and Sams father Jim (Anthony Edwards). Telly runs into Ash Correll (Dominic West) a fellow parent whose daughter Lauren played with Sam in the park and who is also missing. But Ash has no memory of a daughter. And wait till Jim doesnt even remember who Telly is. Sound the ""Twilight Zone"" theme. And if you think Ive given away too much already check out the coming attractions reel from Sony Pictures Revolution Studios; its all there all the giveaways. Telly is a mom a Hollywoodized mom and those gals never quit. They fight until they find exactly what they -- and the audience -- want. So we know where things are going in a general sense. The surprise is finding out whats going on behind the scenes; whos working the evil levers? Theres another surprise in store a CGI effect that will have the audience jumping. What wont make the audience jump is the scenario which consists mostly of Telly and Ash running away from men in dark suits with reckless driving skills Tellys flashbacks of towheaded Sam in the dappled sunlight and the hint of romance between Telly and Ash -- who has been to the gym a lot so it seems only fair. That voodoo part of the story ends up being well sort of banal. The movies so much better when you dont have a clue whats going on. People have said the same thing about life. And I cant dispute that one. Nor can I think of anything more to say. THE FORGOTTEN (PG-13 96 minutes) -- Contains some violence and scary effects. Area theaters.

Julianne Moore stars as Telly Paretta a freelance editor who lives with her husband (Anthony Edwards) in a dark brooding Brooklyn townhouse. In mourning for her 8-year-old son who died in a plane crash 14 months earlier Telly is drifting around in a state of suspended animation invoking her sons memory like a totem every day and visiting a psychiatrist (Gary Sinise) to work through her grief. But soon what looks like normal mourning takes on the characteristics of a deeper emotional disturbance as images of Tellys son Sam begin to disappear first from a photo album and then on a home video. Did Sam ever really exist? Or is Telly the victim of a particularly cruel gaslight scheme? By the time she and a neighbor (Dominic West) are being pursued by federal agents a mysterious stranger and a well-intentioned police detective (Alfre Woodard) the answer becomes clear. But the more details of Sams disappearance are revealed the more improbable and finally preposterous they become. _____More in Movies_____  The Forgotten Details  Watch the Trailer  Current Movie Openings  Fall Film Guide  Arts amp; Living Movies Free E-mail Newsletters Washington Entertainment GuideSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now MoviesSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now TravelSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now At HomeSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now ""The Forgotten"" which has been directed by Joseph Ruben from a script by Gerald Di Pego features a stylish look and solid performances from Sinise West and Moore (who seems to have mastered the art of playing women on the constant verge of tears). But what began as a relatively sophisticated psychological thriller firmly grounded in reality becomes a science fiction creature feature. This radical shift in tone results in an uneasy mix between ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" and the ""The X-Files"" and one not nearly as smart as either.

Whatever coin Sony can abduct during this fall window pic should yield happy returns in its trek through post-theatrical close encounters. A spare streamlined thriller for the conspiracy-minded Area 51 crowd ""The Forgotten"" perhaps wisely leaves more questions than it answers and for the most part manages to maintain its suspense. Although at times overly mundane in its running-from-mysterious-forces motif the film features solid performances and a tantalizing enough plot -- who or what snatched children and sought to expunge their parents memories of them -- to keep audiences guessing until the so-so climax. Whatever coin Sony can abduct during this fall window pic should yield happy returns in its trek through post-theatrical close encounters. Having overseen middling-to-poor thrillers like ""Sleeping With the Enemy"" and ""The Good Son"" director Joseph Ruben knows the terrain and brings a stronger sense of style to this latest production which more than anything feels like an inflated ""The X-Files"" episode. Julianne Moore is in fine form as Telly still emotionally wounded 14 months after the death of her young son in a plane crash. Despite help from her shrink (Gary Sinise) and her husband (Anthony Edwards) she cant quite let the pain go. Suddenly though her scenario changes unnervingly Shes told she never had a son she just dreamed him up after a miscarriage. Moreover another parent who lost a daughter on the same flight but has no recollection of her Ash (Dominic West of HBOs ""The Wire"") inexplicably thinks Tellys nuts too. Somehow though Telly is able to jog Ashs memory of his daughter and the chase is on with trench-coated ""Men in Black""-types (led by another ""The Wire"" regular Robert Wisdom) in hot pursuit. Yet what could not only remove the kids but also magically expunge evidence that they existed? At times Ruben and writer Gerald Di Pego struggle to sustain the action through (an even relatively short) feature length until the inevitable reveal which compels them to throw in one chase too many. Efforts to pad out the story include introducing a skeptical cop (a somewhat miscast Alfre Woodard) to join the hunt though what she can do to help is anybodys guess. Still theres something creepy about the underlying premise augmented by modest but extremely effective and jarring special effects. The sound design alone nearly threatens to eject filmgoers from their seats along with the movies unluckier inhabitants and clever use of aerial photography reinforces the sense of an unorthodox powers involvement. The chemistry also works between Moore and West whose character lost his wife and took up the bottle following his daughters death. Having fine actors like Sinise and Edwards in smaller parts brings extra heft as well to modestly fleshed out roles. Any number of films and ""Twilight Zone"" episodes have tread a similar path before which actually works to ""The Forgottens"" advantage -- as the filmmakers employ what amounts to a shorthand approach relying on viewers to fill in the blanks. And while the payoff isnt exactly ""The Sixth Sense"" territory it at least possesses a rudimentary logic provided that audience members allow their own memories to lapse and dont dwell too long and hard on the outcome.

Starring Julianne Moore Dominic West Gary Sinise Alfre Woodard. Directed by Joseph Ruben. Written by Gerald Di Pego. (PG-13. 91 minutes. At Bay Area theaters). For much of her career Julianne Moore has alternated roles in fine but depressing prestige films with parts in substandard Hollywood fluff. She splits the difference with ""The Forgotten"" a decent but depressing studio thriller. The movies premise is pure agony. Moore plays a mother whose grief for her dead little boy is exacerbated by the refusal of those around her to acknowledge the child existed. The picture never comes out from under the weight of its dreariness despite fine acting foot chases and conspiracy theories galore. Moores character a Brooklyn editor and homemaker named Telly spends a chunk of each day studying pictures of a towheaded son who died along with several other children in a plane crash 14 months earlier. Moore is heartbreaking in scenes that show how grief has consumed this mother. Telly promises her therapist (Gary Sinise) that she spends only an hour a day at the shrine to her son and reminds her husband (Anthony Edwards) that she doesnt abuse the key to the memorabilia drawer. Imagine having ones grief monitored. When the boys image vanishes from photos she accuses the husband of trying to stifle her sadness. But he and the therapist inform her that theyve been easing her into the knowledge she never had a son. She made up his life they contend as a post-traumatic response to a miscarriage. This is the movies most intriguing idea but it is offered too early in the picture to be a real explanation. Telly doesnt buy it and neither does the audience. Sinise and Edwards characters are the slightest bit fishy -- nice nurturing guys with hints of ""Rosemarys Baby"" around the edges. Director Joseph Ruben and cinematographer Anastas Michos create an atmosphere of dread without overdoing it. A bluish cast heightens the sense of autumn chill in Tellys upscale tree-lined neighborhood the kind of place where kids ride bikes and play on jungle gyms in bulky coats. Telly encounters a parent (Dominic West from ""The Wire"") of another plane-crash victim in the park sitting on a swing where their children once played. She later enlists his help in trying to prove the kids existed. Wests character a retired hockey player responds to Telly because shes beautiful and because hes now sloshed most nights. But he doesnt remember his daughter playing with her son or even existing and he resists Tellys efforts to jog his memory. West has the ruggedness of a former hockey player but he also displays an aching vulnerability when his character finally recalls his child. Best yet Wests character provides some sorely needed levity. When Telly tells him of her sons love for baseball the ex-New York Ranger responds that baseballs great because its the only sport one can play while taking a nap. Their quest for truth entails running from federal authorities (for once Moore gets to sprint as much as she cries in a picture) who take an unusual interest in a couple of distraught but otherwise harmless people. Alfre Woodard plays a local cop who wants to be on the parents side a sort of no- nonsense earth mother who resents the feds on her turf. The fugitives hole up in motel rooms when not being followed by authorities (the late-model American sedans are dead giveaways). Moore and West imbue their ad-hoc partnership with a growing trust and mutual protectiveness. The ex-athlete proves helpful in slugging bad guys and jimmying locks and his new friend helps him stay off the sauce. Director Ruben and screenwriter Gerald Di Pego show restraint in never letting this relationship move into romance. The filmmakers also tread a rather delicate line in introducing an element that might have been preposterous but isnt. But neither is it as scary as it should be mainly because Moores character mentions it as a possibility relatively early in the film. This plot development is certainly ambitious but it never quite takes us out of the funk of watching a woman who has lost a child being denied her right to grieve. -- Advisory This film contains violence profanity.

The Forgotten Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2004) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-forgotten-2004,200,theforgotten13,theforgotten,rogerebert
"A compelling disappearing act - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW A compelling disappearing act By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  September 24 2004 What can possibly be worse than losing a child? According to ""The Forgotten"" its being told that the child never existed in direct contradiction to the framed photos on the mantelpiece and the news coverage of the accident. But wait -- the kids no longer in the photos and the obits gone from the newspaper. And your spouse insists youre delusional. Can memories so strong be manufactured out of whole cloth and maternal need? What the hells going on here anyway?Im certainly not going to tell you and you wouldnt believe me if I did. Suffice to say that ""The Forgotten"" turns out to be a grade-A B-movie that grounds its thrills in particulars of time place and character so that when the time comes to make the leap into the wholly preposterous we do so willingly. This is a movie that earns our trust -- and then happily abuses it.As Telly Paretta a Brooklyn book editor and full-time grieving mother Moore connects with a role for the first time since 2002s ""Far From Heaven."" Fourteen months after the death of 9-year-old Sam (Christopher Kovaleski) in a plane crash Telly has come to define herself through mourning but the actress keeps giving us glimpses of the smart prissy yuppie this woman once was. Then Sam starts disappearing from everyones memory but hers Husband Jim (Anthony Edwards) psychiatrist Dr. Munce (Gary Sinise) former baby sitter Eliot (Jessica Hecht). Worse Ash Corell (Dominic West) a neighbor who lost his daughter in the same crash has no knowledge of Telly or his own child or even why hes been in a booze-fueled depression for more than a year. Then Telly peels back Ashs wallpaper and discovers Laurens drawings . . .Thats it Im not saying any more because it would sound incredibly silly and you wouldnt see the movie. Well all right Alfre Woodard plays the kind of tough New York cop who finds out more than is good for her. The shrink knows more than hes letting on but you figured that out the moment you saw shifty-eyed Sinise. And as a colleague pointed out theres some physical business in the last act that may put you in mind of the bridge scene in ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail."" This may not be accidental; the airline Sam travels on is named Quest Air after all.""The Forgotten"" is incredibly silly of course but not during the watching of it. Maybe youll kick yourself upon leaving the theater but while the lights are down youre engaged and increasingly pleasurably thunderstruck. For that thank director Joseph Ruben a Hollywood journeyman who occasionally comes through with an expertly made secretly witty piece of genre trash ""The Stepfather"" in 1987 the underrated ""Good Son"" in 1993.""The Forgotten"" is similarly lean and loose and never mind that it wont get respect from critics and audiences who value art above craft. Ruben takes care to root his story in believable daily life -- in the physical details of Brooklyns DUMBO neighborhood with its two bridges tying the borough to Manhattan the way a child is connected to his parents. Where the characters in most Hollywood suspense films are generically written and played Telly and Ash feel like individuals Shes a snob hes a former pro hockey player with a short fuse and after two days on the run theyre bickering like an old married couple.Eventually theyre led cautiously up to a point where theyre scared out of their wits yet almost chuckling with disbelief over what theyre required to accept. And so are we. And so is Joe Ruben. And thats what makes the difference.Id tell you more but then Id have to kill you. Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

But Moore does more for this psychological thriller than it does for her.Directed by Joseph Ruben (""True Believer"" ""Sleeping with the Enemy"") and written by Gerald DiPego (""Phenomenon"") ""The Forgotten"" begins as an earthbound mind-twisting thriller exploring the emotional pain and grief experienced by a mother over the loss of a child and the mysteries of how the human mind handles those intense emotions.But then it morphs into a sci-fi abduction mystery about halfway through. Suddenly the movie is exploring the same mysteries but in a much different -- and extremely sinister -- way.That awkward transition is the films weakest link. Only the artful acting from this point allows the movie to avoid comparisons to an average episode of ""The Outer Limits"" or a mundane ""X-Files.""In search of the sonMoore plays Telly Paretta a woman haunted by the memory of her son Sam. The child died in plane 14 months ago and her concerned and loving husband played by Anthony Edwards and her calm comforting psychiatrist Dr. Munce (Gary Sinise) try in vain to help her cope with her sudden loss.However it soon becomes apparent that her problems go much deeper. Apparently her son never existed. Her husband her doctor and even her neighbors have just been humoring her. Nevertheless Telly has a deep abiding sense that Sam was real. Meeting Ash Correll (Dominic West) convinces Moores character shes not alone but he has to be convinced of their shared history.After a chance meeting in a park with a neighbor Ash Correll (Dominic West) -- the father of a girl who was also supposedly killed in the same plane crash with Sam -- she desperately tries to make him remember. Ash a former professional hockey player is drowning himself in booze for reasons that are not quite clear to him and refuses to listen. While at Ashs apartment Telly uncovers proof of his daughters existence but Ash refuses to acknowledge it. He too thinks Telly is crazy and calls the police.But then he has a flash and realizes shes telling the truth. At the same time in front of the apartment building Telly is being turned over by the police to the National Security Agency.Yes the National Security Agency.Good performances weak scriptSo in a series of moves worthy of James Bond Ash physically overpowers her guards helps Telly escape and they both end up on the run. The race for the truth is on. Are Tellys and Ashs kids really dead? Are they being held somewhere? Are Telly and Ash just plain crazy? Why is Uncle Sam involved? Is John Ashcroft having a bad day?Moores and Wests performances make this a much better film than it should be. The script is weak in places and if there was one more weepy flashback to the scene where Sam was boarding the plane I think I would have screamed.And somehow the film assumes Telly is the only mother in the entire world who loves her son enough not to forget his existence given all the information she finds out.Well Im a huge Julianne Moore fan so despite ""The Forgottens"" flaws I kind of liked it. But Im not sure its worth your nine bucks -- or the effort to get off your couch. If you want to watch good actors do good work the film will entertain but some of the plot twists beg to be um forgotten.""The Forgotten"" opens nationwide on Friday and is rated PG-13.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for 1.99 Review Perfect Man fatally flawed CNN/Money What TVs most popular dads earn Poll Most prefer to watch movies at home Cruise Holmes engaged to marryCNN/Money Security alert issued for 40 million credit cards Bin Laden deputy sends message U.S. House votes to keep U.N. dues Iran poll to go to run-off ALL AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE DC FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY International Edition Languages --------- Arabic German Japanese Korean Turkish CNN TV CNN International Headline News Transcripts Advertise With Us About Us SEARCH The Web CNN.com (c) 2005 Cable News Network LP LLLP.

She plays a woman named Telly Paretta who is still mourning the death of her 8-year-old son in a plane crash 14 months earlier. Shes wedded to her grief - its her way of clinging to his existence - but then a strange phenomenon occurs. All the mementos of her lost child (photos picture books etc.) begin to appear scrubbed of any sign that he existed. Her husband (Anthony Edwards) claims that they never had a son and even her sensitive shrink (Gary Sinise) thinks that shes gone delusional. When she looks up the newspapers documenting the plane crash the articles are nowhere to be seen. Watching The Forgotten its natural to assume that Telly isnt losing her mind yet how could everyone in the world be in on a plot to wipe away her sons memory? Its as if we were caught in a colossally vague and arbitrary science-fiction conspiracy. Actually we are in a colossally vague and arbitrary science-fiction conspiracy. The Forgotten is a thriller of carefully cultivated murk. Its enigmatic in the worst sense in that every explanation for whats going on holds less water than the last. There is one disquieting special effect At various points people get sucked up into the sky as if by some all-powerful cosmic vacuum cleaner. That sinister force should have sucked up this script too. Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

Oh Whatever Milking Someone Elses 15 Minutes in Damn 5 years ago by Mark Holcomb Interrogating the cruel impermanence of Internet celebrity in real time should be documentary gold especially with as willing a subject as 2010 New York gubernatorial hopeful Jimmy McMillan (he of the auto-repeat tagline ""The rent is too damn high"").
