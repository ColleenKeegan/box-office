Throughout his offbeat career -- from ""Beetlejuice"" to ""Edward Scissorhands"" to ""Corpse Bride"" -- collections of outcasts odd ducks and those who feel themselves to be such are allowed their dysfunction misunderstandings and deep affections. ""Dark Shadows"" is no different. Though hardly in a class with Burton or star Johnny Depps most memorable collaborations this big-screen take on the cult-beloved daytime soap which ran from 1966 to 1971 is an often amusing teasingly naughty lark. Depp is vampire Barnabas Collins. Cursed and entombed nearly 200 years the pale biter in need of a manicure arrives at his ancestral home in 1972. Collinwood Manor has fallen into disrepair and the familys fortunes in the seaside fishing town of Collinsport Maine founded by Barnabas father have dwindled. Meanwhile Angelique the witch who first cursed Barnabas and killed his beloved Josette is doing quite well thank you very much. Eva Green portrays the still-scorned business-savvy Angie. Like many a high-and-mighty clan the modern Collinses are a rather dissipated bunch. Michelle Pfeiffer plays descendent Elizabeth Collins Stoddard. Pfeiffer remains a preternatural beauty which befits her role as matriarch of the diminished clan that includes 15-year-old daughter Carolyn (""Kick-Ass"" star Chloe Grace Moretz) brother Roger (Jonny Lee Miller) and his troubled young son David (Gully McGrath). Helena Bonham Carter takes daffy pleasure in portraying the familys live-in shrink. Dr. Julia Hoffman hasnt helped the Collinses much but shes quite skilled at self-medicating. She also discovers Barnabas identity. Willie Loomis the households jack-of-all-trades but mostly of drink is slovenly inhabited by Jackie Earle Haley. Newly hired governess Victoria Winters (Bella Heathcote) bears an uncanny resemblance to Josette. Audiences have grown utterly accustomed to tales of the aching ardor pangs of conscience and ravenous hunger of vampires. The comedic ""Dark Shadows"" adds little to conversations about timeless romantic hankering or the bottomless thirst that makes fuel of foe friend and stranger alike. The charms here are of a decidedly stranger-in-a-strange-land variety. From the moment Barnabas rises in a 1970s world made garish and vivid thanks to the invention of neon lights there are winks and nudges aplenty. Many of the gags are in the details a board game here the strains of 1970s pop a Gothic manse foyer crowded with the abandoned sports equipment of spoiled children. Who knew troll dolls would function as a madeleine for a certain generation? Burton thats who. There are slightly more elevated visual nods to the original bloodsucker film F.W. Murnaus still-disquieting silent ""Nosferatu""; and to the high Gothic stylings of Alfred Hitchcocks ""Rebecca."" The greatest jests come from Barnabas stilted way of speaking and Depps eternally deadpan delivery. In 1990 ""Edward Scissorhands"" brought moviegoers one of the more tenaciously imaginative star-director pairings in Depp and Burton. This is their eighth outing (not counting ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" which Burton produced and co-wrote). ""Dark Shadows"" reiterates their mutual bond of eccentric humor. While Dan Curtis daytime series didnt wink much kitsch and camp rule in this wholly appreciative rendering. There is a bit of sweet melancholy to the goings-on at Collinwood Manor. How could it be otherwise when a little boy is treated as crazy? Or when a powerful ancestor shows up surveys a tarnished legacy and wants to help? But mostly ""Dark Shadows"" is silly when were trained to expect slightly richer fun from Burton and Depp. As its said of the Collins family again and again one turn of the emotional screw might have made this film ""endure.""

Johnny Depp. Helena Bonham Carter. Horror. Comedy. Camp.A remake of something you may recall from childhood.Its hard to know what might be profitably said about Dark Shadows the latest comingling of elements that have been commingled so frequently of late. Michelle Pfeiffer is tucked away in there somewhere which is new. But if you are at all familiar with the recent Burton oeuvre theres not a great deal I can tell you about the film that you could not probably surmise on your own. Like most recent Burton films Dark Shadows is principally an exercise in style and a study of Johnny Depps cheekbones. Based on the camp-gothic soap opera of the same name which ran from 1966 to 1971 Dark Shadows is silly in that trademarked self-serious Burton manner. As is customary the movie looks ravishing but the plot is underfed. And of course Johnny Depp gets to add one more exhibit to his personal menagerie of weirdoes. Depp plays Barnabas Collins an 18th-century Liverpudlian whose father brings him to New England to make their fortune. As he enters adolescence Barnabas is callow enough to fool around with a household servant Angelique (Eva Green) but not quite callow enough to tell her he loves her. It is to his considerable ill fortune that Angelique turns out to be a witch who enchants Barnabass true love into taking a long walk off a short cliff and then turns him into a vampire cursed to an eternal life alone with his eye shadow. She also arranges to have him sealed in a coffin and buried alive (or alive-ish).Fast forward to Maine 1972. A Beautiful Young Woman With A Dark Secret arrives at the old Collins estate to apply for a job as governess for a Troubled Young Boy Who Also Has A Dark Secret. The movie doesnt spend much time on either Dark Secret though so neither will I. Suffice to say that the Collins clan--run by matriarch Elizabeth (Pfeiffer) and including a live-in alcoholic psychologist (Bonham Carter)--has fallen on tough times their once-thriving fishing empire having gone to the dogs.Fortunately Barnabass coffin is dug up by construction workers and shortly after slaughtering them in the friendliest way possible he arrives back at the Collins manse intending to restore the family to prosperity. (This is rather easily accomplished given that he knows where invaluable works of art are hidden in the house.) MORE ON MOVIES Soap Operas Have Died on TV but Live On in Movies Our Picks for Which Film to See Each Week of Summer The Astonishing Avengers How to Fix the Action Movie And then? Id like to say that the plot loops and swerves in magnificently unexpected directions but the truth is that it doesnt really go anywhere at all. Barnabas feuds with and then has sex with and then goes back to feuding with Angelique the witch from way back--who is also it turns out immortal and has become the Collinses main competitor in the fishing trade. There are gags about how strange the 1970s look to someone from the 1700s and gags about how strange they still look to us. Alice Cooper shows up and croons a couple of songs. Trap doors and secret passages are navigated and re-navigated backstories are unspooled Barnabas cheerfully murders the occasional victim or six and the whole thing ends with a big fire. (Daphne du Maurier isnt the only one who dreamt of Manderley....) Like most recent Burton films Dark Shadows is principally an exercise in style and a study of Johnny Depps cheekbones. The actor is perfectly good here and fans of his past collusions with Burton will find their rewards along the way. But theres a perfunctory vibe to the goings on a weariness amid the weirdness. Characters come and go but with the exception of Green who glowers erotically none are given much to do. The governess (played by young Aussie Bella Heathcote) is forgotten for long stretches only to return at the end as a central participant in a woefully underdeveloped love story. The tone too is a bit scattered with jokes about oral sex and electroshock therapy and parental abandonment awkwardly tossed about. As the movie nears its conclusion a few characters are off-handedly revealed to have new paranormal abilities among them a werewolf who declares ""Lets not make a big deal about it."" Its advice the filmmakers themselves may have taken too broadly.

Twitter previousKids Are More Than Data PointsnextThe GOP Has Made Foreign Policy Debate Totally Dysfunctional Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day. Continue Reading carianoff/flickr Why Some People Respond to Stress by Falling Asleep Elijah Wolfson Fight or flight or sleep Last month my wife and I found ourselves in a disagreement about whether or not our apartment was clean enough for guests--the type of medium-sized disagreement that likely plagues all close relationships. In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

As Hurricane Katrina raged through New Orleans in 2005 neighborhood after neighborhood collapsed from flooding. Of the houses that stood many still had to be bulldozed due to mold within the walls. But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion. Continue Reading Charles Mostoller / Reuters Can Personality Be Changed? Scott Barry Kaufman Psychologists have long debated how flexible someones ""true"" self is. Almost everyone has something they want to change about their personality. In 2014 a study that traced peoples goals for personality change found that the vast majority of its subjects wanted to be more extraverted agreeable emotionally stable and open to new experiences. A whopping 97 percent said they wished they were more conscientious. These desires appeared to be rooted in dissatisfaction. People wanted to become more extraverted if they werent happy with their sex lives hobbies or friendships. They wanted to become more conscientious if they were displeased with their finances or schoolwork. The findings reflect the social psychologist Roy Baumeisters notion of ""crystallization of discontent"" Once people begin to recognize larger patterns of shortcomings in their lives he contends they may reshuffle their core values and priorities to justify improving things.

"Screwy Gothic Dark Shadows abandons melodrama for camp |       NJ.com comments Screwy Gothic Dark Shadows abandons melodrama for camp Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on May 11 2012 at 730 AM updated May 30 2012 at 1106 AM View/Post Comments Peter MountainJohnny Depp as Barnabas Collins in ""Dark Shadows."" The first time it was on television ""Dark Shadows"" was a show that some people laughed at. Now as a big summer movie ""Dark Shadows"" is supposed to be a film you laugh with. I preferred it the first time. I was one of those kids who loved the original Baby Boomer series -- as were Tim Burton and Johnny Depp who have now made it into a movie -- and I took the show seriously even when it got silly. Because even though actors sometimes forgot lines or props failed to work the show never stooped to the low sarcasm of camp. It aimed instead for the heightened emotions of melodrama. Not this time. The basic story now as then is extravagantly Gothic. Released from a chained coffin after 200 years vampire Barnabas Collins returns to his ancestral home in Maine -- where he sees in his ancestors new governess the face of his great lost love. Can he rekindle their passion with her reincarnation? Burtons film keeps that story line while adding a Rip van Winkle element the TV show overlooked -- Barnabas shock at what the world has come to in two centuries. Its a new slant on the material which is exactly what every remake should have. Except Depp and Burton are a giggling duo who apart from ""Sweeney Todd"" have rarely been able to avoid sending up the material they adapt. So their ""Dark Shadows"" plays Barnabas discomfort -- and the groovy 1970s period -- for laughs. The film starts off seriously with an 18th-century flashback and ends with a special-effects free-for-all. But in between its just an old favorite revamped as a new comedy from filmmakers who clearly prefer working in a jocular not jugular vein. But thats not what made the original ""Dark Shadows"" so much fun -- and Burton and Depp should know it. Yes everything about the show was overdone -- starting with that redundancy of the title. But it was never done out of mockery. Real melodrama -- and thats what even the lowliest of daytime shows always aspired to -- embraces heightened emotions. Its why theres an ""opera"" in ""soap opera"" acknowledging the genres over-the-top plots and passions. Thats changed over the years as TV serials moved to prime time and went for plush tongue-in-chic camp. But real melodramas were never meant to be played like the arent-they-fabulous ""Desperate Housewives."" Their models instead were the played-straight truly desperate housewives of Barbara Stanwyck weepies Joan Crawford dramas Susan Hayward tear-jerkers. Except in the case of ""Dark Shadows"" with fangs. Depp however goes for easy laughs and as always Burton is too taken with the art direction to reel him in. In fact all the men here embrace the obvious. (As Barnabas shiftless henchman Jackie Earle Haley makes the original John Karlen look subtle -- a truly dubious achievement). The women fare better. As scheming matriarch Elizabeth Collins Michelle Pfeiffer finds the right grande-dame attitude early and works it beautifully. Fine too is Helena Bonham Carter as Julia Hoffman the familys live-in therapist and Chloe Grace Moretz as cranky teen Carolyn. In fact among the actresses only Eva Green -- locked in a two-front battle with both her accent and her hair -- fails to convince. Sneering and snarling she comes across less as Barnabas eternal frenemy Angelique than as a drag performer from some camp revue. Sadly that seems to be just what Burton wanted. It is perhaps far too late to expect him or his favorite star to play anything straight; I shouldnt be surprised their version of this story went for comedy. (Yes there are sex jokes.) And yes some of it is very funny. Clearly they made the movie they wanted to make. Its just not the movie this ""Dark Shadows"" fan hoped to see. Ratings note The film contains violence drug abuse and sexual situations. Dark Shadows (PG-13) Warner Bros (113 min.) Directed by Tim Burton. With Johnny Depp Eva Green Michelle Pfeiffer Helena Bonham Carter. Now playing in New Jersey.

STEPHEN COLE The Globe and Mail Published Friday May 11 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 222PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The partnership of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp began with the shrewdly playful Edward Scissorhands (1990) and Ed Wood (1994). These were movies that understood how private neuroses fuel public heroes a knowledge Burton put to good use in his smart funny Batman movies. Who might show up next in Burton-Depps island of misfit toys? Orson Welles (a character in Ed Wood)? A movie queen? Hey maybe the real thing- Princess Di? Screen grab from the online trailer for the Tim Burton film ""Dark Shadows"" starring Johnny Depp Movies Dark Shadows The official trailer Olivia Harris/Reuters video Video Depp casts Dark Shadows in London Johnny Depp in Dark Shadows. Reuters Movies Video Johnny Depp talks about Dark Shadows No such luck. The next five Burton-Depp movies were costume parties that failed to involve audiences. A wearying cynicism crept into the partnership. The sour Charlie and the Chocolate Factory allowed Depp to cruelly impersonate Michael Jackson. Sweeney Todd was an excuse for the star to put a skunk streak in his hair. Burton and Depps eighth collaboration Dark Shadows is a remake of the 1966-71 after-school TV show a gothic soap featuring an aristocratic vampire Barnabas Collins. Series themes - hypnosis revenge doomed trysts - resonated with high-school and college audiences. The film comes from a script by Seth Grahame-Smith author of the novels Pride amp; Prejudice and Zombies and Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter. Clearly Burton was intrigued by the writers fanciful hybrids for Dark Shadows is now a giddy mash-up of times and temperaments. Barnabas (Depp) is an 18th-century vampire who wakes from a 200-year nap. The first 10 minutes take place in Liverpool and storm-lashed Maine inside gloomy mansions. We have witches and potions along with a beautiful willing servant girl angling tragically for Barnabass heart. Then suddenly Barnabas is in toothpaste-bright 1972 shielding his eyes from lava lamps and blinding orange McDonalds signs. T. Rex is on the turntable. ""When can the horses be ready?"" he asks the reigning matriarch (Michelle Pfeiffer) upon returning to Collins manor. ""We dont have horses; we have a Chevy"" she replies. At that same dinner table a niece asks Barnabas ""Are you stoned or something?"" ""They tried stoning me my dear"" the vampire purrs. ""It did not work."" And thats your Dark Shadows remake - Johnny Depp playing to his public image as a hipster roue. Nothing else is important here certainly not Pfeiffer or Helena Bonham-Carter who are left with little to do as our heros puzzled heirs. Younger actresses Eva Green ( Casino Royale) and Bella Heathcote are more involved as Barnabass love interests. But even Heathcote passes through the film without provoking interest and shes supposed to be Barnabass reason for being. No Dark Shadows only meaningful relationship is between Depp and his audience. Hes a persona now no longer an actor. And the kick here as always is watching him try on funny accents and hairdos. Hes going for a London art school bohemian sound and look this time sporting long hair sculpted close to the skull. Our vampire apparently wants to join The Moody Blues. Filmmaker Burton meanwhile satisfies himself with mucking about a haunted mansion and playing with crane shots outdoors.

Photo Michelle Pfeiffer aims to please. Not for the first time Johnny Depp is all dressed up -- this time as an elegant 19th-century vampire unleashed in 1972 -- with nowhere particularly coherent to go in Tim Burtons campy riff on the old TV soap opera ""Dark Shadows. Though nearly as confusing as their wildly popular take on ""Alice in Wonderland Depp and Burtons eighth collaboration is more fun perhaps more to the point and it looks far better. Its not in headache-inducingly bad 3-D like its predecessor so you can fully appreciate the magical special effects gorgeous costumes and amazing set design -- as well as such period artifacts as lava lamps macrame and troll dolls. These touches are more satisfying than a convoluted script by genre-bender Seth Grahame-Smith (the upcoming ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter) that often falls short in its attempt to combine a fish-out-of-water comedy with a Gothic romantic thriller. PHOTOS DARK SHADOWS AND OTHER BIG-SCREEN REMAKES Depp 48 a childhood fan of the soap opera eagerly dons white greasepaint and a waistcoat to extravagantly play Barnabas Collins far less seriously than in the characters 1969-1971 heyday (which included a pair of theatrical spinoff features). The orphaned scion of a wealthy Maine family Barnabas is cursed with fangs and eternal life after breaking off a fling with Angelique (a very sexy Eva Green) a house maid who unfortunately turns out to be a practicing witch. Freed from his chained coffin 196 years later by workmen on whose blood he feasts in sanitized PG-13 fashion Barnabas learns that while they may still occupy his crumbling old mansion the Collins family has fallen on hard times. Much of the films first hour is devoted to introducing characters who have little to do. Theres the officious matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Michelle Pfeiffer) who has an alienated daughter (Chloe Moretz). Also on hand is Elizabeths brother (Jonny Lee Miller) who shows little interest in his disturbed young son (Gully McGrath) whose mother has died. The son has a newly arrived nanny (Bella Heathcote) bearing an uncanny resemblance to Barnabas long-ago true love whom the jealous Angelique sent toppling off a cliff. Despite an elaborate introduction this underexplained young woman (a reincarnation?) largely disappears from the action -- she has no scenes with her young charge -- until shes needed for the climax. When hes not making a quick snack of pot-smoking hippies proclaiming Vietnam ""the last war Barnabas is mostly ordering around the hypnotized caretaker of Collinwood Manor (Jackie Earle Haley) as part of his grand plan to restore the Collins fishing empire and their mansion to their former glories. Barnabas is also undergoing dubious blood transfusions at the hands of the Collins self-medicating in-house psychiatrist (Helena Bonham Carter) in an attempt at a cure that he hopes will make him more appealing to the seldom-seen nanny. None of this sits well with the still-alive and still-breathtakingly gorgeous Angelique who has driven the Collins family to the brink of bankruptcy by building her own fishing empire -- but still has the hots for her old employer Barnabas. ""Dark Shadows certainly has its moments especially when Barnabas and Angelique hilariously wreck her office during a surreal CGI-fueled PG-rated tryst. Burton lays on a buffet of pop music -- everything from ""Theme From a Summer Place to 70s icons Karen Carpenter and Barry White -- to supplement the score by his longtime composer Danny Elfman. There are tons of movie references and cameo appearances by veteran bloodsuckers Christopher Lee and Jonathan Frid -- the original TV Barnabas who died on Friday the 13th last month -- as well as Alice Cooper as himself. ""Ugliest woman Ive ever seen proclaims Barnabas in a fairly good sample of the movies wit. What stayed with me most was not the undernourished story line but the films cool visuals -- the many sliding doors in Collin-wood Manor and wonderfully detailed docks in Collinsport and 19th-century Liverpool all constructed on English soundstages and impeccably photographed by Bruno Delbonnel. Maybe its because I share Burtons twisted affection for the 1970s but for all its shortcomings Id sooner watch a sequel to ""Dark Shadows than another installment of the bloated ""Pirates of the Caribbean saga any day.

Tim Burtons retread of the 1970s daytime goth-opera - starring Johnny Depp as original sexy-vamp Barnabas Collins - does exactly what the Depp-inspired comedy ""21 Jump Street"" so cleverly critiqued lazily recycling old TV shows and hoping no one will notice. Unlike that energetic genuinely funny comedy Burtons mash-up of post-60s kitsch and modern-day knowingness strikes a chord that is less self-aware than fatally self-satisfied. ""Dark Shadows"" doesnt know where it wants to dwell in the eerie subversive penumbra suggested by its title or in playful go-for-broke camp. With a look that takes its inspiration from equal parts ""Edward Scissorhands"" and F.W. Murnaus ""Nosferatu"" Depp once again affects the chalky pallor that has become something of a signature throughout his eight-movie collaboration with Burton. By ""Dark Shadows "" final scene the kabuki-white greasepaint has been troweled on so thickly he resembles less a human character than one of Burtons animated creations. Perhaps thats the best way to understand an alternately antic and deadly dull enterprise content to remain as steadfastly two-dimensional as the ""Scooby-Doo"" cartoon it briefly invokes. For his part Depp once again plumbs his vocal depths to come up with a sonorously memorable voice for Barnabas beginning with a narrated preamble explaining how the Collins family settled in Maine made a fortune in fishing built a soaring manor of Collinwood and suffered tragedy at the hands of a witchy servant girl named Angelique (Eva Green). After Barnabas rejects her love she turns him into a vampire and banishes him to a grave for 200 years; when hes unearthed by a team of workmen he proceeds to kill them all - a nasty bit of business that along with several other murders Barnabas commits ""Dark Shadows"" skates over with blithe insouciance. When Barnabus returns to Collinwood he meets some of his descendants Elizabeth (the still sensational Michelle Pfeiffer) her pouty nymphet daughter Carolyn (Chloe Grace Moretz) a dissolute Collins heir named Roger (Jonny Lee Miller) and his sweetly sensitive young son David (Gulliver McGrath). Also at large in the massive down-at-heel pile a psychiatrist named Dr. Hoffman played by Burtons wife Helena Bonham Carter with blowsy wide-beamed brio and a wide-eyed governess named Victoria Winters (Bella Heathcote). The best part of ""Dark Shadows"" is Collinwood itself rendered by Burton as a fascinating temporal collage in which a family lives in genteel poverty sipping their coffee from Pier One cups amid 18th-century finery gathering dust. But Burton winds up driving such piquant anachronisms into the ground with a constant barrage of jokes featuring Barnabas interfacing with 1970s culture from a troll doll and a lava lamp to Karen Carpenter and Alice Cooper (who shows up in a truly nonsensical cameo). Theres little by way of a story in ""Dark Shadows"" which instead works as a glib if attractively atmospheric collage of winks and references. The ribald humor - and at least one supernaturally pugilistic sex scene - that runs through ""Dark Shadows"" will most likely go over the heads of the youngsters to whom the rest of the movie is presumably aimed. Whether theyre frightened or bored by the fangs ghosts and copious amounts of blood is a matter of taste and temperament. But surely no one regardless of age will buy the third-act twist that occurs in the middle of the mayhem that Angelique brings down on Collinwood. ""Dark Shadows"" was written by Seth Grahame-Smith whose novels ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" and ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" will soon be seen in big-screen version. If this is a hint of things to come the joke is already in serious danger of being played out.Contains comic horror violence sexual content some drug use profanity and smoking.

The supernatural series ran on weekday afternoons from June 1966 to April 1971 racking up 1225 episodes and entertaining millions of viewers with its Gothic tales of vampires ghosts time travel and shoddily constructed sets. Its easy to see why Burton and Depp would be fans of it and easy to see why theyd be considered the perfect team to adapt it into a film. But this thing they came up with -- what is this? This is tiresome meandering piffle. I care not a whit for the sanctity of the original series (which Ive never seen) but surely its fans wont like the slick comical tone of Burtons version as far as I can tell apart from the character names and some plot elements almost none of this resembles the old soap opera. Written by first-timer Seth Grahame-Smith -- whose novel Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter is about to become a movie -- this Dark Shadows cant decide whether its a parody a horror comedy an atmospheric melodrama or a tedious bucket of crap. Eventually it chooses the last one. Depp plays Barnabas Collins an England-born Maine-raised scion of a wealthy fishing-industry family who in 1775 or thereabouts was turned into a vampire and buried alive. He is unearthed in 1972 to find that the Collins family still inhabits the gorgeous Collinwood mansion but that they are no longer the towns most prominent citizens. Their business has been usurped by a rival cannery run by Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green) who is 1) a witch and 2) the very witch who killed Barnabas fiancee and cursed the poor fellow with vampirism 200 years earlier. Barnabas is thus especially motivated to help the Collinses regain their fortune. The familys matriarch Elizabeth (Michelle Pfeiffer) is at first the only one who knows that Barnabas is a vampire from the 1700s; everyone else is told hes a distant relative from England. This leads to several unbearable moments where Barnabas making no attempt to conceal his true nature says something vampire-y or 1700s-y followed by Elizabeth hastily improvising an explanation like its Threes Company or something. All of that is lame but I did get a few laughs from Barnabas incongruously refined manner of speech particularly when hes confused by a modern device. (""Show yourself Satan Mock me not with your strange luminance"" he says to a cars headlights.) Elizabeths 15-year-old daughter Carolyn (Chloe Grace Moretz) is a brooding wannabe sexpot. (Suggestion for Burton try not to sexualize your 15-year-old actresses so much Thanks) Elizabeths brother Roger (Jonny Lee Miller) sticks around long enough for the movie to check him off the list then vanishes. Rogers son 8-year-old David (Gulliver McGrath) sees ghosts. (Suggestion for screenwriter since the story has no use for Roger delete him from the script and make David Elizabeths son instead.) David has a new governess Victoria Winters (Bella Heathcote) who also sees ghosts and who is a dead ringer for Barnabas long-dead fiancee. Also on hand are Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter) here to care for troubled young David -- though shes been living at Collinwood for years it seems -- and a caretaker named Willie (Jackie Earle Haley) who becomes Barnabas lackey. Surely this is the laziest film of Burtons career. It reeks of deletions second-guessing and plain old not caring. I mentioned the Roger character who serves no purpose and is quickly dispatched. Some other examples of inane inept storytelling - Victoria tells Barnabas that young David ""idolizes"" him. But as of the moment she says this Barnabas and David have not spoken a word to each other. Theyve only even been in the same room a couple times and never addressed one another. Whatever idolizing David has done has taken place behind our backs. - Barnabas has sex with Angelique even though he hates her and has the hots for Victoria. Later Angelique crashes a fancy ball being thrown by the Collinses yet the only thing she does is witness Barnabas and Victoria sharing a kiss. Thats it. Thats the sole reason for her character showing up. - Victoria seems to be a major character at the beginning of the film. We hear her thoughts and see her train journey from New York City to Maine. Yet its not until 80 minutes into the movie that we learn her history (complete with flashbacks) -- and then its forgotten again. - Speaking of Victoria she disappears for the last 20 minutes of the movie. While the large clunkily choreographed woefully unfunny showdown between Angelique and the Collinses is taking place Victoria is simply ... not present. Helena Bonham Carter has very little screen time and does little with it. Michelle Pfeiffer has plenty of screen time but is given no character to play. Christopher Lee gets 30 seconds as a fishing-boat captain -- an appalling waste of Christopher Lee. Last-minute revelations about certain characters are included just to set up a sequel with no bearing on the present story. I dont know what tortuous journey Grahame-Smiths screenplay took (frequent Burton collaborator John August did enough writing or rewriting to earn a ""story by"" credit) but it wouldnt pass the scrutiny of a first-year screenwriting instructor. Its a mess. Burtons contributions as director are just as scattershot. There are a few nods to his familiar style of macabre humor but most of the comedy is broader and less imaginative than that. When its not being comedic -- rather when its not unsuccessfully attempting to be comedic -- the film is a dull mishmash of unclear character motivations and uncertain tone. Are we ever supposed to be creeped out by anything? Should we feel suspense? Mystery? Excitement? I have no idea. This things a wreck. The more I think about it the more I dislike it. I should probably follow Burtons example and just not think about it.

Groovy MOVIE REVIEW By Mick LaSalle Updated 500 pm Wednesday October 3 2012 Video Dark Shadows (Trailer) The trailer for ""Dark Shadows"" Media San Francisco Chronicle Dark Shadows Horror comedy. Starring Johnny Depp Eva Green and Michelle Pfeiffer. Directed by Tim Burton. (PG-13. 113 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Its difficult to pay tribute to something in earnest and yet spoof it at the same time. Err too far on the side of sincerity and you have something that rings false. Take the satire too far and you have a movie thats funny for 15 minutes and then meaningless for the next hour and a half. But in ""Dark Shadows"" Tim Burton and screenwriters Seth Grahame-Smith and John August get the balance right. They dont get it perfect. There are times not too many when the movie drags. But when you consider all the pitfalls avoided and all the laughs and pleasures it provides along the way ""Dark Shadows"" is a satisfying and skillful effort. One graceful touch is that they plow through all the intricate backstory in an entertaining pre-credits sequence that tells how Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) became a vampire. In fact he deserved what he got ""Dark Shadows"" can be seen as the story of a man whose unaccountable taste in women - he says no to Eva Green who plays a witch - lands him in a coffin for 200 years.

Pictures Image 8 of 8 Dark Shadows review Undead in the 70s? Groovy 1 / 8 Back to Gallery When he is dug out two centuries later the year is 1972 but Barnabas still talks as if it were 1770 or like Johnny Depp in half of his movies. He sees a cars headlights and thinks he is seeing the eyes of the devil. He sees a television set and believes that little people are trapped inside. You might think that the fish-out-of-water aspect might get old after two or three jokes but ""Dark Shadows"" successfully taps that vein so to speak for the entire movie. Part of the success comes from the fact that 1972 is alien not just to him but to us. So mixed in there is an early-70s spoof of the drugs and the counterculture and of Wishnick dolls lava lamps and board games. In one scene in the midst of a self-pitying rant Barnabas rests his head on what appears to be a piano. But no its an organ of a type that was popular in that era and his head triggers one of the devices recorded backbeats. So ""Dark Shadows"" works two kinds of comedy - comic dislocation and period satire. But wait theres more. When Barnabas returns to his ancestral home the lady of the house his distant relation (Michelle Pfeiffer) makes him promise not to tell the rest of the household that hes a vampire. And so we get a perfect farce setup in which the audience knows whats going on but most of the characters are only confused as Barnabas picks up a fork and blithely remarks ""Had this been real silver my hand would have burst into flame at the slightest touch."" All this comedy in constant motion makes it possible for ""Dark Shadows"" to concentrate on the plot mechanics only to the extent that theyre interesting Barnabas finds himself in an ongoing battle with Angelique (Green) who being a witch is eternally youthful and running half the town. These scenes between the fabulously confident Angelique and the dignified but easily rattled Barnabas are as funny as anything in the film. But this is also where the filmmakers inject a touch the slightest touch of seriousness. Angelique really is in love with this guy. She should get her head examined. Depp has a lot of self-consciousness as an actor but Barnabas is the most self-conscious of characters and so the combination works. Green brings dimension to what might have been a one-note villain and the rest of the cast is up for fun including Helena Bonham Carter as the family psychiatrist. However the resolution of the psychiatrists story line feels extraneous and makes for the pictures one sour note. The sets and atmospherics are up to Tim Burtons usual high standard - he usually gets those right - and the early 70s music on the soundtrack has never sounded better even stuff you wouldnt expect such as the Carpenters ""Top of the World."" When it came on I found myself not wanting the song to end and perhaps Burton felt that way too because he doesnt cut it off. He lets it play out. Somehow the scene needed it. Who would have guessed?

"Dark Shadows is a lesson in Tim Burtons quirks Review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesReview Dark Shadows is a lesson in Tim Burtons quirksIn Dark Shadows Johnny Depp is entertainingly weird as vampire Barnabas Collins but director Tim Burtons weaknesses in story and drama show.May 11 2012|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic They dont call it ""Tim Burtons Dark Shadows"" but they might as well have.Nominally based on the cult favorite 1960s daytime soap opera this film has much more to do with what goes on inside director Tim Burtons head than with any TV show no matter how beloved. In fact ""Dark Shadows"" is as good an example as any of what might be called the Way of Tim a style of making films that like the drinking of blood is very much an acquired taste and unless youre a vampire not worth the effort.Blood of course figures prominently in both the original ""Dark Shadows""which ran on ABC for 1225 episodes between 1966 and 1971 and this new version for both focus on the character of Barnabas Collins an 18th century vampire who reappears in todays world. Back in the day having a contemporary vampire on a daytime soap was unheard of and ""Dark Shadows"" soon developed a devoted following that extended into reruns including two youngsters who grew up to wield great power in Hollywood filmmaker Burton and his frequent star Johnny Depp.PHOTOS Dark Shadows premiereWith Depp onboard as Collins the director was free to construct his own version of ""Dark Shadows"" which plays much more fang in cheek so to speak than the more straight-ahead original. As a result the film turns out to be an uncertain combination of elements that unsuccessfully tries to be half-scary half-funny and all strange a project that offers examples of the three Ws that make up the Way of Tim."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""649"" height=""160""gt;The first W is as always wonderful production design which comes courtesy of Burtons longtime collaborator Rick Heinrichs who won an Oscar for his work on the directors ""Sleepy Hollow."" Heinrichs has two worlds to deal with in the Seth Grahame-Smith script starting with the rocky seacoast of Maine in the 1770s. Here resides the Collins family grown great on the wealth fishing provides whove founded the town of Collinsport and who live in a looming mansion called Collinswood Manor.The Collinses only son Barnabas (Depp) is something of a ladies man but when he toys with the affections of servant Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green) he finds he literally has hell to pay. For Angelique is a practicing witch who brings a bleak end to Barnabas love for Josette DuPres (Bella Heathcote) and turns the man himself into a vampire. Then just to rub it in she has him buried alive ""so that his suffering would never end."" Ouch.PHOTOS Dark Shadows premiereEternity doesnt last as long as it used to and a mere 200 years have passed when some unwary and unfortunate construction workers unearth Barnabas coffin and set him free. ""You cant imagine"" he says after hes done his worst ""how thirsty I am....""Barnabas soon makes his way to Collinswood Manor where hes passed off to the locals as a distant relative visiting from England. Very distant. The only person Barnabas freely takes into his confidence is the lady of the manor Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (a welcome part for Michelle Pfeiffer another youthful devotee of the TV series). Together they plot to return the Collins family to prominence.Standing in their way is the latest incarnation of Angelique the ageless witch of yore who still lives in the area and runs a fish company called Angel Bay. Similarly a young governess named Victoria Winters whos employed at Collinswood Manor is an incarnation of Barnabas old love Josette. And so it goes.Helping to make all this folderol initially palatable is the second W of the Way of Tim a certifiably weird performance by Depp who likes nothing better than to disappear into the odd creatures that his director creates for his delectation. Burton and Depp have worked together so often a this is their eighth collaboration a that they are in danger of becoming a mondo bizarro version of John Ford and John Wayne. Still Depps performance is so unwavering in its commitment to eccentricity that it is hard not to be fitfully entertained.Depp amuses himself and others as a man out of time a priggish somewhat effete individual who is astounded at his first glimpse of television (""Reveal yourself tiny songstress"" he says to singers on the screen) and as many dieters have before him mistakes the M in a huge McDonalds sign for the entrance to hell."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""649"" height=""110""gt;But as engaging as Depp can be he and the rest of the ensemble (which includes Helena Bonham Carter Chloe Grace Moretz and Jackie Earle Haley) are tripped up by the third W which is Burtons woeful lack of concern with story and drama.A director of moments rather than wholes Burton is prone to wander off point and engage with peripheral concerns (like a pointless concert cameo by Alice Cooper) rather than such pedestrian matters as plot coherence. ""Dark Shadows"" is all over the place getting more grotesque and less involving the longer it goes on and that as even the undead would admit is a damned shame.Dark ShadowsMPAA rating PG-13 for comic horror violence sexual content some drug use language and smokingRunning time 1 hour 53 minutesPlaying In general releaseA PHOTOS Dark Shadows premierekenneth.turanlatimes.com"");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""649"" height=""110""gt; MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESDark Shadows Lara Parker conjures Wolf Moon Rising TV...September 14 2013Dark Shadows is still in her bloodAugust 8 2011Denizens of Dark Shadows 3 memorable charactersAugust 8 2011"");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""300"" height=""250""gt;MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesTim BurtonEntertainmentVampireCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-dark-shadows-20120511,0,6011043.story?track=rss",200,darkshadows13,darkshadows,latimes

The two-word title makes you want to know whos wishing for what while the single word sounds generic and self-congratulatory. That said this wise and funny film in Japanese with English subtitles works small miracles in depicting the pivotal moment when kids turn from the wishfulness of childhood into shaping the world for themselves. ENLARGE Ohshiro Maeda as Ryu and Koki Maeda as Koichi in I Wish. Magnolia Pictures The sweetly reflective hero a sixth-grader named Koichi starts out by wishing for a volcano to erupt. Not just any volcano but the one that towers above his town smoking ominously and scattering ash. An eruption would lead to an evacuation which would lead at least in his mind to a reunion with his father and kid brother whove been living up north in Hakata while Koichi lives down south in Kagoshima with his mother and retired grandparents. The volcano knowing nothing of this declines to erupt but Koichi hears of another approach to provoking the desired miracle. A new bullet train line will soon be linking the two cities. Rumor has it that if you stand at the exact spot where the northbound and southbound trains pass each other whatever you wish will come true. At the age of 50 the filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-Eda has already made one masterpiece about childhood the initially enchanting and ultimately shattering ""Nobody Knows"" in which four middle-class Tokyo siblings must fend for themselves after being abandoned by their mother. His new film which evokes--and transcends--Yasujiro Ozus 1959 modest classic ""Good Morning"" does not aspire to masterpiece status. Its plot turns on a fanciful notion rather than a fateful event. Still that notion allows plenty of room for cockeyed comedy and for pungent observations about the exciting but endlessly bewildering condition of being a kid. Four words that come most easily to Koichis lips are ""I dont get it."" He doesnt get why everyone is so calm when the volcano is on the verge of erupting; why they built his school on the top of a steep hill or what his musician father means when he says he wants Koichi to grow up to be someone who cares about more than his own life. Like what? Like music his father replies or the world. ""Whats the world?"" Koichi asks. ""I dont get it."" His little sprite of a brother Ryunosuke has a silly side that doesnt care about anything but having fun. Yet Ryu too has suffered the pain of his parents separation. ""Do kids today feel anything about anything?"" one oldster asks another in the course of decrying the state of the world. The movie reminds us that kids feel everything about everything; only in understanding do they come up short. Unlike the widely distributed and heavily promoted studio productions that fill the multiplexes at this time of year ""I Wish"" requires seeking out. But its one of those indie films youll watch with pleasure and not just for its wit and wisdom. (If only that could be said of Hollywoods product.) Although the perfection of the kids performances suggests spontaneous conversations recorded by hidden cameras the dialogue was in fact written and the cameras were unconcealed so the secret ingredient must have been the direction. (Koichi and Ryu are played by real-life brothers Koki and Ohshiro Maeda.) The cinematography by the directors longtime collaborator Yutaka Yamasaki models the kids faces with soft warm light and captures striking images on the fly a blue popsicle a silver bicycle bell a slanting street in long shot as school kids make the morning trek to their hovering school. One of the pleasures of ""I Wish"" is watching how kids behave--how Koichi attacks his dinner how Ryus small body literally vibrates as fireworks and music inflame his soul. (The original score by Quruli has a bluegrass tinge.) Another pleasure is rediscovering in case youd forgotten how kids think. These kids can be logical and ever so ruseful as witness the brothers success in organizing a journey to the bullet-train convergence spot. But their thought processes can also be extragalactic. A girl who wants to paint beautiful pictures without working at it wishes her schools program of ""relaxed education"" would come back. A boy wishes he could play baseball like his idol who eats curry for breakfast so he too starts eating curry for breakfast instead of practicing on the field. Another boy tries to wish his dead dog Marble back to life. And what does Koichi finally wish for? I wish youd see this lovely film to find out. An imprisoned vampire Barnabas Collins is set free and returns to his ancestral home where his dysfunctional descendants are in need of his protection. Video courtesy of Warners. Dark Shadows Ive saved Tim Burtons latest creep show for second because ""Dark Shadows"" is amusing in fits and spurts and sure to make tons of money but terribly familiar and fatigued. The material has been siphoned--as opposed to distilled--from the supernatural soap opera that ran to 1225 episodes on afternoon TV in the mid-1960s and early 70s. Now its a postgothic pastiche of undercooked camp and overproduced effects with Johnny Depp as the romantically haunted vampire Barnabas Collins who is accidentally sprung from his coffin in a Maine fishing village two centuries after being buried alive. ENLARGE Johnny Depp in Dark Shadows. Warner Bros. Pictures Mr. Depp bites off less than he can chew by sampling bits and bytes of former roles the fey lilt of Jack Sparrow the epicene affect of Willy Wonka the elaborate courtliness of Don Juan DeMarco. When Barnabas returns to the dusty ruin of his ancestral home Collinwood Manor he finds the current matriarch Elizabeth (Michelle Pfeiffer) presiding gloomily over a household that includes her obstreperous daughter Carolyn (Chloe Grace Moretz); her sullen brother Roger (Jonny Lee Miller); his troubled son David (Gully McGrath) and Davids bibulous shrink Dr. Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter in a red fright wig). He also finds Bella Heathcotes Victoria a recently arrived nanny whos a dead ringer for the love of his former life and Eva Greens Angelique who bears a portentous resemblance to a witch he once spurned. If that sounds insufficiently attractive theres also Alice Cooper looking no worse than ever. A group of Lebanese women try to ease religious tensions between Christians and Muslims in their village. Video courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics. Where Do We Go Now? ENLARGE Nadine Labaki at center and other cast members in Where Do We Go Now? Sony Pictures Classics Nadine Labakis second film as a director--shes a spirited actress as well--takes place in the sticks of Lebanon an isolated village where TV is just arriving in the form of a battered receiver and a rusty satellite dish. When I reviewed her 2007 debut feature ""Caramel"" an urban comedy set in a Beirut beauty salon I said it was anything but a feminist manifesto. Its safe to call her new one a feminist manifesto from start (women in a cemetery wiggling their behinds in time with syncopated funeral music) to finish (men carrying a casket in the same cemetery). An absurdist fantasy on a solemn theme ""Where Do We Go Now?"" suffers from a serious clash of styles but its also brave and startlingly funny--at one point verging on ""Mamma Mia""--when it isnt bleak or shocking. The subject is mens propensity for sectarian violence and a desperate attempt to put a lid on it by some smart raffish women. Until recently the village has considered religious wars a distant curse what with Christians and Muslims living together peacefully. Now though strife seems so close at hand that the women must act quickly or lives will be lost. Unlike Lysistrata and her co-conspirators they arent about withholding sexual favors. Their tactics include staging a miracle baking the local equivalent of hash brownies and hiring a traveling troupe of Ukrainian strippers. Whether they succeed is open to question but the signal success of Ms. Labakis movie is the sense it conveys of explosive incipience in a village and a region overstocked with hair triggers. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD Focus After Life (1998) Dont confuse Hirokazu Kore-Edas ""After Life"" a meditation on memory and death with ""After.Life"" a sententious stinker starring Christina Ricci and Liam Neeson. The Japanese film which mixes fiction and documentary modes grew out of interviews in which hundreds of people were asked to describe the one memory of life on earth that theyd want to take with them to heaven. The film is slow and some posts on Amazon express dissatisfaction with the DVD quality--it isnt available on Netflix. My memory though tells me that ""After Life"" is a work whose magical beauty will shine through technical imperfections. Good Morning (1959) Movie lovers owe Criterion thanks for their catalog of classic films in meticulously remastered versions. Yasujiro Ozus 1959 comedy which was originally called ""Ohayo"" is a worthy part of the collection. Shot in Ozus customary style--that is to say formal bordering on austere since most of his interior shots were filmed from the height of a person kneeling on a tatami mat--this little tale of two young brothers silent rebellion (their father refuses to buy a TV) is shot through with cheerful humor and intriguing details of suburban Japan as it started opening up to Western culture. The Witches of Eastwick (1987) Michelle Pfeiffer is one of three bored women in a picture-book New England town who discover their special powers by accident; her witchmates are Cher and Susan Sarandon. Jack Nicholson is the gleeful lecher who shows up to sate their appetites. ""Your average horny little devil"" is how he describes himself with considerable understatement; in fact hes Lucifer incarnate. The cast includes Veronica Cartwright and Richard Jenkins. George Miller directed from Michael Cristofers erratic adaptation of John Updikes novel but the script isnt the thing Mr. Nicholson is and hes terrific. --Joe Morgenstern Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Donald Trump Lashes Out at Michael Bloomberg GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

"Dark Shadows starring Johnny Depp reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Dark Shadows It Will Remind You Why You Once Liked Johnny Depp Dark Shadows It Will Remind You Why You Once Liked Johnny Depp Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 10 2012 636 PM Dark Shadows It will remind you why you once liked Johnny Depp. By Dana Stevens Hey look. Its Johnny Depp in a costume and makeup. (c) 2012 Warner Bros. Pictures. All rights reserved. Dark Shadows (Warner Bros.) was probably a beneficiary of the low expectations I brought into it. Tim Burton adapts a late-60s/early 70s TV soap about a melancholy vampire with Johnny Depp in the lead All the elements of that sound so drearily familiar from vampires to TV-shows-turned-movies to Burton/Depp collaborations in camp-Gothic mode. And stretches of this movie do feel dreary like Burtons recent Alice in Wonderland Dark Shadows puts too much faith in the power of lavish costumes and eye-popping set decor and Danny Elfmans music and too little in constructing a well-paced story. But theres something there that elevates Burtons Dark Shadows above the strained plodding whimsy of his Alice At least he and Depp both avowed childhood fans of the original series seem to be in their element and having a grand old time. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. I recall the ABC series Dark Shadows only as a formless but vivid childhood sense memory. By the time I was old enough to watch it was in languid syndication the kind of thing that would play on a high-on-the-dial channel in the early afternoon on a weekday. I usually caught it only when I was home sick from school which may account for the quality of febrile vagueness with which I remember the show. I had no sense of who the characters were or what they were doing just that there was a lot of velvet and wall sconces and long meaningful looks between serious-faced adults in scary costumes. And the background sound--a mixture of noodling theremins and echo-y soundstage silence--was (and still is) obscurely terrifying. Watching Dark Shadows on Netflix now (the whole series is currently streaming) I realize how radical it must have seemed in the TV landscape of the time In a world of candy-colored Laugh-In giddiness it was somber creepy high camp and its use of live-to-tape format (one take with line flubs and other glitches left in) only added to its rough-and-ready appeal. Depp who would have been 7 when Dark Shadows went off the air in 1971 has said that his identification with the show was so deep as child that he longed for nothing more than to be Barnabas Collins the 18th-century English vampire who awakens into the modern world. Its easy to see why Depp has always loved to play melancholy outsiders who find happiness only when they embrace their inner weirdo (a role Tim Burton a longtime friend has lovingly supplied Depp with in nearly every one of the eight films theyve done together). Depp is also drawn to roles involving extreme costumes and makeup another specialty of Burtons. Advertisement Its Depp as Barnabas that holds the movie together. The story may be less than coherent and some of the minor characters washouts but when hes on-screen theres energy and humor and that foppish sex appeal that (as in the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie) reminds you why you once liked Johnny Depp. As he roams the halls of Collinwood mansion gloomily clutching a lace hanky Depp sometimes evokes Tim Curry as the transsexual mad scientist Dr. Frank-N-Furter in The Rocky Horror Picture Show (not that his performance or this movie achieves that level of camp sublimity). The movie version of Barnabas wakes from his two-century sleep near the town of Collinsport Maine where he lived as a child with his wealthy parents. When as a young man Barnabas jilted his housemaid Angelique (Eva Greene) for a wispy beauty named Josette (Bella Heathcote) Angelique went bonkers revealed her true nature as a witch and cast deadly spells on both Josette and Barnabas parents before turning him into a vampire and chaining him in a coffin. When Barnabas finally escapes his prison in 1972 the evil Angelique is still alive or rather still undead and shes determined to keep him from finding love with the Collinwood mansions new governess Victoria Winter (also played by Bella Heathcote--which is not to suggest that she might be you know the reincarnation of Barnabas lost love or anything like that ...) The portion of the movie in which a fresh-from-the-grave Barnabas acquaints himself with the customs of American pop culture circa 1972 is full of silly-but-satisfying vampire sight gags Barnabas brushes his teeth before a bathroom mirror in which all we see is a floating toothbrush. Unable to find a dignified place for his daytime naps Barnabas is reduced to using an empty refrigerator box an aggrieved expression on his face as he cleans out the packing peanuts. The aesthetic dissonance of a vampire encountering a lava lamp or a box of Wheaties isnt enough to sustain a whole movie--as we learn with a yawn in Dark Shadows hectic overcrammed last act--but it provides for some pretty good jokes in the middle section. So does Helena Bonham Carter Tim Burtons real-life partner who is steadily becoming one of the best character actresses going. Here she plays a no-nonsense tough-talking shrink who lives with the Collins family in order to counsel their young son (Gulliver McGrath) whos haunted by the ghost of his mother. Michelle Pfeiffer is underserved by her role as the steely Collins family matriarch but she still nails the few big scenes she gets. (More Michelle Pfeiffer please.) And Eva Greene the coolly beautiful French actress who played James Bonds treacherous true love in Casino Royale really needs to become the next big thing pronto She turns a fairly generic sexy witch into a memorably delicious villain especially in a scene where she and Barnabas destroy a very mod 70s office in a bout of athletic gravity-defying sex. I dont mean to oversell Dark Shadows-at the end of the day its just another overcooked late-Tim Burton style-fest with enough good gags and strong performances to keep the audience from dwelling on the flaws. But Hollywood greenlighters should take note It makes a small but important difference when the property a big-budget director is adapting is something he truly loves. Correction May 10 2012 This review originally stated that Johnny Depp would have been 9 years old when Dark Shadows original run ended. (Return to corrected sentence.)

From Dark Shadows - Balls Balls Credit Warner Bros. From Dark Shadows - Times Have Changed Times Have Changed Credit Warner Bros. Pictures Putting together a Halloween costume must be a breeze at Johnny Depps house. Forget pirate Jack Sparrow. If you just took a few of the characters hes played for director Tim Burton -- the Mad Hatter mad barber Sweeney Todd mad candymaker Willy Wonka and those two mad Eds Wood and Scissorhands youd have a whole closetful of costuming possibilities. To which the star now adds Dark Shadows madly aristocratic vampire Barnabas Collins onetime heir to Collinwood Mansion and for roughly two centuries buried alive -- or at any rate undead -- before being unearthed by a decidedly unfortunate construction crew. Depp who as a kid was reportedly obsessed with Barnabas on the Gothic daytime soap that inspired this campy big-screen redo is clearly delighted to be sinking his teeth into the role. But Burton and the rest of the cast seem less sure why theyre there and audiences may well feel the same way. The action begins with an 18th century prologue played straight -- young Barnabas setting sail from Liverpool for Maine where his family will establish a fishing village and where he will make the mistake of sleeping with but not falling for a witchy servant girl named Angelique (Eva Green). She turns him into a vampire giving him eternal life and then buries him alive to give him time to reconsider. Released from the coffin in 1972 he discovers that things have changed a bit. Cars lava lamps hippies -- theres a lot for an undead 18th century gentleman to take in including his familys diminished circumstances. Angelique also being immortal has gone into competition with the Collins fishing biz and more or less bankrupted Barnabas last few distant relatives who live in a now-dilapidated Collinwood Mansion that Barnabas regards optimistically as a fixer-upper. Much is made of Barnabas antiquated speech patterns pre-Victorian views and unfamiliarity with 1970s slang. ""Are you stoned?"" wonders his great-great-great-grandniece. ""They tried stoning me"" he replies. ""It did not work."" i Despite the generational gap between Barnabas and the family Collins of the 1970s he takes to his descendants well and David (Gully McGrath) Roger (Jonny Lee Miller) Elizabeth (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Carolyn (Chloe Grace Moretz) more or less accept him.

Peter Mountain/Warner Brothers Pictures All of which makes Tim Burtons Dark Shadows more a vampire-out-of-water story than a homage to the original TV show or a trek through the Buffyverse. Its stately with a smirk crossing Bram Stoker with The Addams Family to arrive at what sometimes feels like a wildly overproduced Saturday Night Live sketch. Screenwriter Seth Grahame-Smith also has Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter coming out later this summer so hell have a chance to tap another vein as it were of vampire myth. Here despite the presence of Helena Bonham Carter and Michelle Pfeiffer as harpies of differing stripes plus Jackie Earle Haley as a modern-day servant and cameos by the likes of Christopher Lee Alice Cooper and Jonathan Frid -- the original Barnabas who died just weeks before the films debut -- the jokes only really have bite when theyre being deftly undersold by Depp. The film is otherwise handsome vaguely true to the old soap opera and inert. Toward the end of the movie Burton offers some visual nods to Nosferatu Hitchcocks Rebecca and of all things Death Becomes Her suggesting that at some point he may have had broader satirical notions batting around his head. What hes actually put on-screen unfortunately is just kind of batty.

The Mad Hatter. The partnership between Tim Burton and his go-to actor is getting stale. Spin the wheel to pick a pop culture oddball put ""Johnny Depp is ..."" in front of it and start building sets. Just as the Adam McKay-Will Ferrell collaborations ran dry of wacky professions the point of diminishing returns must arrive. And so it has with the drab ""Dark Shadows."" Never before have they attacked such uncertain material with so little gusto or levity. The film has a terminal case of the blahs. ""Dark Shadows"" opens promisingly downshifts after 30 minutes and sputters into a meandering momentum-free mess. Depp plays Barnabas Collins the brooding bloodsucker who debuted in Dan Curtis horror-tinged TV soap opera in 1966. An atmospheric prologue sets up his tragic dilemma. The heir of an 18th-century Maine fishing fortune he rejects the advances of serving girl Angelique (Eva Green). The beauty reveals herself as a witch kills Barnabas true love Josette (Bella Heathcote) transforms him into a vampire and buries him in a padlocked casket. Unearthed by a backhoe crew in 1972 he finds himself sharing the family mansion with his distant descendants. Here the movie is at its most assured mining outsider humor from his reactions to an odd new world of paved roadways electric lights and soft rock. The laughs here come from the way Barnabas putters around the Collins mansion encountering a troll doll here a lava lamp there an Eggo on his breakfast plate and stifles his startled dismay like a gentleman. Hes also funny at rest hanging upside-down bat-style here and there around the house. Luckily this is enough to keep us amused. Regrettably the film starts flirting with a plot. Reverting to its soap-opera roots it unreels miles of tedious story line about modern-day Collinsport where the undead Angelique now heads a rival canning company. The Collins clans newly arrived nanny is a dead ringer for Barnabas lost Josette and the romantic triangle repeats itself. Michelle Pfeiffer channels steely Joan Collins chic as the matriarch of the Collins brood. Jonny Lee Miller so electric in ""Trainspotting"" is a chalk outline of a character as her wastrel brother. Helena Bonham Carter takes an honest swing at the part of the familys boozy pill-popping live-in psychologist and Chloe Grace Moretz is a sly delight as the familys teen who has two settings Surly and stoned. The script by ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" novelist Seth Grahame-Smith is not exactly a triumph of functional design. It feels as if he took all the moving-the-plot-along drudgery of TV soaps as his template. Every scene spent belaboring character conflicts and advancing the story is a scene wasted. The film needs comedic anarchy. Instead we get production-design bloat and hectic misplaced action. Yes the Collins manor is magnificently ugly. Sure the cannery blows up real good when its time to toss in some splosions. Sure the furniture-smashing love tryst wrestling match between Barnabas and Angelique demolishes a lot of interior decoration. Warner Bros. Warner Bros. Pictures Gully McGrath left and Johnny Depp in ""Dark Shadows."" But all that ingenuity should have gone into devising better scenes for Depp. He successfully walks a tightrope here in scene after scene as terrible as it is that he fangs a couple dozen innocent victims hes not unsympathetic. How can you hate someone with such elegant spitcurls?

From Dark Shadows - Balls Balls Credit Warner Bros. From Dark Shadows - Times Have Changed Times Have Changed Credit Warner Bros. Pictures Two score and four years ago Id fly home from fourth grade for the 4 p.m. broadcast of Dark Shadows. In 1968 vampires and werewolves werent mainstream -- the eras horror films mostly played drive-ins -- yet here on TV was a daily horror soap opera. In 1966 creator Dan Curtis conceived of a show that was Gothic but nonsupernatural like Jane Eyre. But after less than a year with Dark Shadows on the verge of cancellation he threw a Hail Mary pass directing his writers to add a vampire. In came Barnabas Collins played by Canadian actor Jonathan Frid a villain meant to be staked through the heart after a few months. But fan response went through the roof and Barnabas became a lovelorn hero fighting against his curse a predecessor to Twilights Edward Cullen -- while the 40ish Frid became an unlikely teen-girl heartthrob alongside Shindig idol Bobby Sherman. Frid who died recently routinely fluffed his lines at a time when it was too expensive to reshoot and edit the videotape. But many people -- including the actor himself -- thought his palpable discomfort worked for the character. His Barnabas seemed afflicted with a nervous melancholy. While the plotline was nonsensical the pacing torturous and the budget tiny Dark Shadows cast a spell. Its hard to suppress my preference for talking about the original over Tim Burtons film which isnt a remake so much as a mostly unfunny camp sendup. The script by Seth Grahame-Smith is witless and meandering -- and I wouldnt mind the witless so much if it moved or the meandering if it were droll. Theres no evident love of the genre as in Burtons splendid Hammer Films homage Sleepy Hollow and a lot of the targets are low-hanging fruit -- loud 60s and 70s fashions or a late-18th-century vampire finding himself in 1972 pounding on a TV set and calling Karen Carpenter a tiny sorceress. (OK thats funny. Still I cant tell why Dark Shadows was made apart from Johnny Depps wanting to play Barnabas.) The 1790s prologue is played straight although it hurtles by so quickly it feels like a coming-attraction reel. Barnabas heir to the Collins estate on the Maine coast sleeps with and then jilts a servant girl Angelique (Eva Green) who turns out to be a witch. i Eva Green plays Angelique Bouchard Barnabas spurned lover -- and witch -- who makes it her mission to take revenge on him and his family. Warner Brothers Pictures hide caption toggle caption Warner Brothers Pictures Eva Green plays Angelique Bouchard Barnabas spurned lover -- and witch -- who makes it her mission to take revenge on him and his family. Warner Brothers Pictures The jealous Angelique compels Barnabas true love Josette to fling herself from a high cliff curses Barnabas with vampirism and arranges for him to be sealed in his coffin for eternity. Dug up two centuries later by a construction crew the vampire discovers that the class-envious Angelique not only lives but has taken over the fishing village of Collinsport and driven the aristocratic Collins family into near bankruptcy. In between ripping out throats and swooning over Collins governess Victoria Winters a dead ringer for Josette played by Bella Heathcote Barnabas vows to restore the family fishing business -- and so Dark Shadows becomes a business farce in which Depps taloned whey-faced bloodsucker constantly fends off the sultry Greens advances. At least Eva Green is a loose-limbed glittering-eyed seductress-cum-terminator -- and too much woman if you ask me for Depps lightweight ghoul. Its great that he didnt go the dreamy movie-star route to compete with Twilight but his Barnabas is at the other extreme -- a freaky little boy in a Halloween costume. The other actors look amusing in Colleen Atwoods eye-popping clothes against Rick Heinrichs hyperbolic Gothic sets but theyre playing one-joke characters. In the old Joan Bennett matriarch role Michelle Pfeiffer does a starched great-lady turn with spasms of mugging while Helena Bonham Carter in a flame-red wig plays Dr. Julia Hoffman as a conniving dipsomaniac. Chloe Grace Moretz has bright moments as the teenage Carolyn but everyone else -- including Hammer veteran Christopher Lee and a handful of original Dark Shadows actors -- are trotted out to no good end. Tim Burton exults in things offbeat droopy morbid. But the ghoulishly amusing images notwithstanding Dark Shadows is dead on the screen.

Pictures/Peter Mountain In this film image released by Warner Bros. Johnny Depp portrays Barnabas Collins in ""Dark Shadows."" By JOY TIPPING jtippingdallasnews.com Staff Writer Published 09 May 2012 0808 PM Updated 10 May 2012 0139 PM If youve seen the commercials youve already seen most of the best parts of Dark Shadows director Tim Burtons much-anticipated take on the cult-favorite television show which ran from 1966 to 1971.The story such as it is starts in the late 1700s as the British Collins family arrives in Maine and starts building a fish-canning empire (how romantic). When Collins family hottie Barnabas (Johnny Depp) spurns the love of local witch Angelique (Eva Green) she curses him to live as a vampire and promptly buries him chained in a casket.Fast-forward to 1972 when construction workers dig up Barnabas and he strolls into Collinswood the decaying family manse (the fish-canning business having gone all stinky) determined to restake his claim on the Collinses and their fortunes. Too bad Angelique is still around fretting cursing and ... well cursing. Even worse shes the owner of the towns more successful cannery Angel Bay.At home Barnabas must deal with modern-day matriarch Elizabeth (Michelle Pfeiffer looking hideously wan even though shes not a supernatural character); her brother Roger (Jonny Lee Miller) and his ""troubled"" son David (Gulliver McGrath doing his best take on Damien from The Omen); and Elizabeths teenage daughter Carolyn (the fabulously sullen Chloe Grace Moretz).Rounding out the household are drooling servant Willie (Jackie Earle Haley); Davids boozy shrink Dr. Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter); and his newly arrived nanny (Bella Heathcote) who bears a striking resemblance to Barnabas 18th-century love Josette who met a tragic end courtesy of the wicked Angelique.The film gets some things right particularly the melodramatic style of acting employed by Depp and the rest of the cast -- at least I fervently hope that it was on purpose. Depp delivers his many one-liners with splendidly droll timing and the sight gags are close to perfection (Barnabas tucked away in the higher reaches of a linen closet Angelique spewing green vomit a la The Exorcist in one of many references to early 1970s pop culture and music).When Barnabas spies Karen Carpenter on TV and screams ""Reveal yourself tiny songstress"" the preview audience went into paroxysms of glee.Alas thats just a one-liner that has nothing to do with the actual story. Writer Seth Grahame-Smith obviously has a thing for gimmicks and vampires; hes the author of the successful novel Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter which is also being made into a film. Perhaps hed best stick to the novel form because he has no knack for screen storytelling and he throws things into the mix that make no sense.Why for instance must Barnabas murder entire groups of people when he needs a drink? Instead of just stealthily plucking one from the pack as any self-respecting vampire would do he makes a big show of taking out entire clans. Not very smart.The films biggest disappointment is the utter lack of chemistry between Depp and either Green or Heathcote. Far from generating any heat their embraces just left me wondering how the women would get all of Depps lipstick and makeup off their clothes. A sex scene between Depp and Green that leaves the room topsy-turvy and shredded would have been hilarious if only we hadnt just seen that in Breaking Dawn.Cameos by Christopher Lee and original TV cast members including the late Jonathan Frid (he was the TV Barnabas) are completely wasted. Frids blink-and-you-miss-it nonspeaking role in the party scene might as well not be there. I know because I blinked and I missed it.DARK SHADOWSC- Directed by Tim Burton.

Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Thursday May 10 2012 145 PM Title Dark Shadows Film Info With Johnny Depp Michelle Pfeiffer. A vampire returns to help his weird family. Director Tim Burton. (153) PG-13 Violence drug use. Area theaters. Tim Burton and Johnny Depp have met the ghoul of their dreams in ""Dark Shadows."" His name is Barnabas Collins and if it doesnt ring a bell the TV wasnt on enough during your Gen-X childhood. Just Barnabas name alone is enough to strike giddiness into the hearts of ""Shadows"" fanatics -- oh they know who they are -- and so alterations in this big-screen version of the 1966-71 series may not matter. Whether it works is a matter of taste but the fact that Burtons revisit unearths enough fun while feeling like four films in one is testament to the sources seductive bloodline. Depps Barnabas we find out in a prologue was the scion of a Maine fishing dynasty whose family built the town of Collinsport and Collinwood Manor. But in the mid-1700s he trifles with the heart of a young witch named Angelique (Eva Green) while loving dewy Josette (Bella Heathcote). The angry witch forces Josette to her doom and makes Barnabas a member of the undead. Buried alive by angry townspeople Barnabas is accidentally dug up in 1972 and returns to Collinwood just as Victoria Winters (also Heathcote) takes a job as governess. The modern Collins family is a weird bunch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Michelle Pfeiffer) has a surly daughter Carolyn (Chloe Grace Mortez) and a sleazy brother Roger (Jonny Lee Miller). Rogers troubled son David (Gulliver McGrath) requires not only a governess but a live-in psychiatrist Dr. Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter). Then theres the odd groundsman (Jackie Earle Haley) How does a vampire stand out in this crowd? Barnabas is horrified to find his rich and strange descendants lazing about in drawing rooms while their fishing-cannery business is driven into ruin by the immortal still-angry Angelique. Barnabas takes it on his sun-resistant shoulders to save them destroy the witch and rekindle his love with Josette who haunts -- or perhaps is -- Victoria. Thats obviously a soap opera seasons worth of plot; screenwriter Seth Grahame-Smith and Burton vet John August do yeomans work keeping it all straight. If Burton seems bored by the plot -- as he often does in his visually spiky but sprawling projects -- theres plenty of neck-chomping ""Munsters""-ish visual jokes and trap doors to watch out for. Yet as genially macabre as ""Dark Shadows"" is it tries to serve too many masters. Initially its an epic valentine to the show (Victorias arrival set to ""Nights in White Satin"" is indeed trance-inducing). Then its a vamp-out-of-water story as Barnabas gets in tune with the Me Decade. Soon its a gung-ho comedy as the fanged patriarch takes over. Finally its a monster flick leading up to an effects-filled battle between a vampire a witch a werewolf and a ghost as a potential corpse bride sleepwalks. Jinkies Through it all however Depp provides one of his more memorable creatures for Burton. Pfeiffer is beyond the valley of the droll while Moretz proves to be a lip-curling natural at this stuff and Bonham-Carter gives her real-life partner Burton another wickedly demented turn. Theyre all creepy kooky mysterious and spooky and keep ""Dark Shadows"" from dying a slow death.

Pictures and Village Roadshow Pictures ""Dark Shadows"" a Warner Bros. Pictures release. Photo Credit Handout advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT An ancient vampire rises from his coffin in the strange new world of 1972. BOTTOM LINE Even after years of vampire-mania this comedy is fresh funny and -- be warned -- surprisingly blood CAST Johnny Depp Eva Green Helena Bonham Carter Michelle Pfeiffer LENGTH 152 By rights Tim Burtons vampire comedy ""Dark Shadows"" ought to be about as fresh as a buried corpse. After years of vampire mania do we really need a vampire spoof? Arent the ""Twilight"" movies funny enough? ""Dark Shadows"" doesnt add anything new to the genre but its a surprisingly high-spirited and genuinely black-humored comedy. Fans of the 60s-era soap-opera of the same name may be disappointed to see the straight-faced characters and fog-enshrouded Maine locale become fodder for farce but the rest of us will welcome ""Dark Shadows"" as the antidote to ""Twilight"" with Depps aristocratic vampire-hero Barnabas Collins refreshingly free of the saintly chastity and healthy diet of Edward Cullen. Barnabas is more like the serial-killer protagonist of Charlie Chaplins ""Monsieur Verdoux"" whose slippery amoralism only makes him more endearing. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Unlike Edward Barnabas isnt above bedding the help (common practice in 1750 no doubt) and after awakening from slumber in 1972 he finds that womens lib has its benefits. But the new world isnt all fast women and slow-moving tender hippies. Depressed by the decrepit state of his familys mansion (now graced by macrame and resin grapes) he slumps across the keyboard of the nearest organ triggering a preprogrammed drumbeat. Though Depp over-gesticulates a bit and the film sometimes overdoes the lava-lamp jokes ""Dark Shadows"" shines thanks mainly to its terrific supporting cast including Michelle Pfeiffer as a steely matriarch Helena Bonham Carter as a pill-popping shrink and Chloe Grace Moretz as a discomfitingly sultry teenager. Bella Heathcote gives Barnabas wholesome beloved Victoria an eerie doll-like quality. The show-stealer however is Eva Green (""Casino Royale"") as the spurned servant Angelique still alive and hopping mad. And though Barnabas doth protest shes clearly his soul mate in soullessness. Their room-wrecking love scene is a treat and unlike the one in ""Twilight"" played entirely for laughs.

Slideshow Dark Shadows Premiere Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about Dark Shadows >> The protagonist of Tim Burtons merrily macabre Dark Shadows was put there way back in the 1750s. It isnt until 1972 when a construction crew bangs its shovels onto something hard that Barnabas emerges from his slumber. Said gentleman happens to be a vampire and he happens to be extremely thirsty. Bad luck for the guys in the hard hats. Adapted from the daytime Gothic soap of the late 60s and early 70s - a seminal TV experience for the prepubescent Burton - Dark Shadows is a nutty romp thats as much about celebrating a significant blip in the pop-cult continuum as it is a tale of bloodsucking of grudge-holding and the stress involved in maintaining a 200-room two-century-old house. Oh and no surprise here Johnny Depp - in his eighth collaboration with director Burton - stars as Barnabas a man seriously out of sync with the times. (Eyeing Chloe Grace Moretz who plays Barnabas volatile teenage cousin Carolyn he surmises that she must be a prostitute - why else would she be wearing such skimpy garb?) Depp sports an English accent - the Collinses were Brits who sailed for Maine where they set up a thriving fishery business. And he sports a blanched complexion befitting someone wary of the sun. Indeed Burton and his music supervisor missed an ideal vintage hit for their soundtrack Procol Harums ""Whiter Shade of Pale"" would have perfectly described Depps skin tone. But never mind the movie boasts an inspired retro playlist The Moody Blues ""Nights in White Satin"" sets the tone over the opening credits and Donovans ""Season of the Witch"" T. Rexs ""Get It On"" and the Carpenters ""Top of the World"" pinpoint the era with buoyant specificity. And pinpointing the era - lovingly - is very much what Dark Shadows has on its mind. While theres a tangle of romance and vengeance and all sorts of family matters to deal with Burtons film is really about hippies in bell-bottoms stoned out in their VW micro-buses. Its about shag carpeting lava lamps and troll dolls. The marquee of Collinsports movie theater offers another chrono-cultural tipoff Deliverance is playing one week Super Fly the next. And so Depps Barnabas heads up to Collinwood Manor the crumbling manse where he finds the family matriarch Elizabeth (Michelle Pfeiffer) presiding over a dysfunctional clan. There is the raging sulkhead played by Moretz and there is Elizabeths deadbeat brother Roger (Jonny Lee Miller) not sure what to make of his inquisitive 10-year-old David (Gully McGrath). There are so many problems here that the Collinses have a live-in shrink Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter) who happens to be drunk most of the time. Jackie Earle Haley hunched and hoary is the caretaker Willie. But its the two women in Barnabas (very long) life that really matter Victoria Winters (Bella Heathcote) is a young lass hired on to nanny David but she bears a striking resemblance to Josette the ethereal beauty Barnabas fatefully fell for in the mid-18th century. And Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green) the jealous witch who buried Barnabas alive when he professed his love for another is now Angie a hard-charging exec who runs a cannery on the Collinsport docks. When Barnabas and Angelique meet again they tear the place up - literally. Its an epic I-hate-you/I-lust-for-you set piece beautifully pulled off with acrobatic flair (and CG and wires). The look of Dark Shadows is hallucinogenic and hyper-real with carved stairway banisters and fireplace figurines springing to life with vivid Goth tableaux and groovy clothes with raging seas and trippy skies. Just when the whole vampire thing was beginning to feel old Depp and Burton have come along to make it feel well very 1972 again. Cool.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> If youre not interested in what Johnny Depp and director Tim Burton are cooking up youre missing out on one of the best go-your-own-way teams in screen history. Dark Shadows their eighth collaboration to date doesnt occupy the rarefied air of Ed Wood Edward Scissorhands and Sweeney Todd. Its too scattershot for the pantheon but at least as good as Alice and Wonderland and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Burtons visuals are a sumptuous treat as is Depps unerring sense of mischief playing Barnabas Collins a vampire with family problems. More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Based on the daily daytime soap that ran on ABC from 1966 to 1971 Dark Shadows radiates affection for the TV version that starred Jonathan Frid (who died in April) as Barnabas. Resurrected from 200 years of coffin boredom Barnabas turns up at the family manor in Maine circa 1972 to find fast food and faster technology as fearsome a plague as the threat of the stake. The wreck of the Collinwood estate is run by the family matriarch Elizabeth (a delicious Michelle Pfeiffer) who strains to control her brother Roger (Jonny Lee Miller) her sullen teen daughter Carolyn (Chloe Grace Moretz) and Rogers motherless 10-year-old handful David (Gulliver McGrath). This family is so dysfunctional it employs a full-time live-in shrink Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter is a hoot and a half). Two centuries ago the human Barnabas had proposed to pretty little Josette (Bella Heathcote) while having it on with hottie servant Angelique (a scary-sexy Eva Green). Little did he know that Angelique was a witch who didnt like being spurned. Hence the vampire curse. And if you dont think both ladies turn up in 1972 you dont  know Hollywood. Writer Seth Grahame-Smith attempts to assemble 1225 TV episodes into a coherent 112-minute script. He fails. And Burton is no help following his own private fancies while the plot hits a series of dead ends. After a fierce and funny start Dark Shadows simply spins its wheels. Props to Depp and a game-for-anything cast including Jackie Earle Haley as a creepy handyman and Alice Cooper as - yikes - himself for a diverting ride. But the pleasures of Dark Shadows are frustratingly hit-and-miss. In the end it all collapses into a spectacularly gorgeous heap.

And then when early trailers revealed that Burton was making a comedy with humor springing from an 18th-century vampires confusion in the mini-skirted world of 1972 it appeared that Burton would be returning to his ""Beetlejuice"" roots mining laughs from the supernatural. But now we get the movie itself which turns out to be not particularly funny and not at all scary with characters so barely defined that they would work only in a spoof of the material. (Which brings us back to the ""not particularly funny"" problem.) Also read Dark Shadows Trailer Johnny Depp Vamps and Camps It Up (Video) The result is an expensive all-star bore albeit a bore thats been art-directed to a fare-thee-well (by Chris Lowe and his team) with clothing and furnishings captured to full and garish Watergate-era effect while all the faces mortal and immortal alike retain a ghostly ghastly pallor. Johnny Depp stars as Barnabas Collins heir to a rich and powerful fishing dynasty in colonial Maine. He loves the fair Josette (Bella Heathcote) but makes the mistake of spurning the lovesick Angelique (Eva Green) who drives Josette to suicide turns Barnabas into a vampire and convinces the Collinsport townsfolk to bury him alive. Almost two centuries later a work crew accidentally disinters Barnabas coffin releasing the bloodsucker into a world he barely recognizes. The still-living witch Angelique (now known as Angel Bay) has taken over the towns fishing and cannery businesses and the only ones still living in the moldering Collins family manor are Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Michelle Pfeiffer) and her discontented teen daughter Carolyn (Chloe Grace Moritz) along with Roger Collins (Jonny Lee Miller) and his son David (Gulliver McGrath). Also in the house is boozy psychiatrist Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter) who hopes to disabuse David of the notion that he can communicate with his dead mother. Also read Johnny Depp Scores Big With Unsexy Roles"" target=""_blank""gt;Sexiest Man Alive Johnny Depp Scores Big With Unsexy Roles Arriving on the scene just before Barnabas is Davids new governess Victoria (Heathcote) who turns out to be Josettes spitting image. This potentially interesting subplot gets scuttled for most of the film as does Victoria herself but while its a flaw of the script (written by ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" author Seth Grahame-Smith from a story by Grahame-Smith and John August) it spares us from Heathcotes flat performance. Shes got the right look for the movie resembling one of Edgar Allan Poes wan heroines but the more she talks the less interesting she is. The film basically reignites the love-hate relationship between Barnabas and Angelique while throwing in tons of werent-the-70s-wacky jokes (Macrame The Carpenters Lava lamps) that felt played out four years ago when the mostly-forgotten Will Ferrell vehicle ""Semi-Pro"" hit theaters. Depp milks whatever laughs he can out of the anachronism humor and Pfeiffer nails a specific kind of daytime-drama earnestness but the rest of the cast feels adrift when not downright miscast. (Second only to Heathcotes blandness is Greens inability to select and stick with an accent.) ""Dark Shadows"" reminds us that Tim Burton is the Woody Allen for Hot Topic shoppers -- going in you never know if youre getting one of his great movies or one of his duds. This one falls firmly thuddingly into the latter category. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Comments click to enlarge Dark Shadows Video Rated PG-13  113 minutes  2012 Tim Burton is like a billionaire fanboy who buys Bela Lugosis Dracula cape he has a perfect right to it but that doesnt mean it looks good on him. The director of Batman (1989) Mars Attacks (1996) Planet of the Apes (2001) and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) has now gotten his hands on Dark Shadows the supernatural soap opera that ran on ABC from 1966 to 71. Unfortunately he cant think of anything to do but goof on it juxtaposing its gothic moodiness with the flower power of the era a typical gag involves vampire hero Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) intoning the lyrics to Steve Millers ""The Joker."" The movie is fairly entertaining but the high production values and shticky humor invert the dynamic of the show which was played totally straight despite the fact that the sets were always threatening to fall down. With Michelle Pfeiffer Eva Green Helena Bonham Carter and Jonathan Frid the original Barnabas whos squandered in a wordless one-shot cameo as a party guest. By J.R.

You know youre in good hands almost from the start. After the long lugubrious opening sequence set in 18th-century Collinsport has established the ghastly back story of Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) and the curse that has rendered him a bloodsucking creature of the night ""Dark Shadows"" whisks us forward to the ultra-modern year of . . . 1972. A speeding train cuts through the Maine woods in a swooping aerial shot. Aboard the train is a pretty young woman (Bella Heathcote) with saucer eyes and a pageboy flip. The colors are soft almost washed out -- the palette of a low-budget Hammer horror film from 41/2 decades ago. On the soundtrack the lonely strum of the Moody Blues ""Nights in White Satin"" erupts like a slow-motion bloom.Tim Burton has got his groove back.""Dark Shadows"" doesnt pretend to be anything more than an entertainment but it recaptures the experience of watching the Gothic daytime soap opera (originally aired on ABC from 1966 to 1971) with rapturous comic bliss. The pleasure of the show was that it was cut-rate junk that still gave you the willies; if you caught it in the afternoons after school when you should have been doing homework you were torn between laughter and pulling a blanket over your head. ""Dark Shadows"" combined the baroque twists of classic soaps with monster-movie music and a leading man (played by Jonathan Frid) who was a pasty spectral turn-on. It was as if Nosferatu had stumbled into ""The Days of Our Lives.""Burton Depp and writers John August and Seth Grahame-Smith both send up the original show and honor the cheesy doom-mongering that made it so much fun. Imprisoned in a coffin for 200 years by Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green) the servant girl he seduced without knowing she was a witch Barnabas returns to 20th-century Collinsport ready to reclaim his dynastic greatness. To his shock the family manse Collinswood is a wreck and the family itself even more so.Matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Michelle Pfeiffer regally ridiculous) holds court over a dissolute clan of Bronte-esque castoffs surly teen daughter Carolyn (Chloe Grace Moretz in full-on jailbait mode) epicene brother Roger (Jonny Lee Miller) Rogers mournful young son David (Gulliver McGrath) and boozy family shrink Dr. Julia Hoffman (Burton mainstay and main squeeze Helena Bonham Carter). Jackie Earle Haley as the caretaker prowls the grounds like a seedy sawed-off Lurch.The movie works a lot of comic mileage out of Barnabass collisions with the modern world and its marvels. A scene where he sees Karen Carpenter singing ""Top of the World"" on TV and rips the back off the box shrieking ""Reveal yourself tiny sorceress"" is one of many felicities. ""Dark Shadows"" gets laughs even from its product placement A well-known fast-food franchise is the cause for much confusion on the heros part early on. Barnabas wants to revive the Collins glory by reopening the fish-canning factory that was the familys early source of wealth but hes blocked by Angelique eternally young forever evil and CEO of the competition. (The French Green gives a rabidly amusing impersonation of an all-American vamp). Shes also still in love with Barnabas who hasnt quite forgiven her for sending his true love Josette (Heathcote again) over a cliff in that opening sequence. ""Dark Shadows"" has great fun with the heavy-breathing passions of both Gothic fiction and daytime soaps; an antic sex scene between witch and vampire has the two making love up the walls and across the ceiling before plummeting into bad-idea regrets on the sofa.That scene doesnt even make sense but you may not care. After the cluttered pointlessness of ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" many of us had given up on Burton but this project lets him tap into his morbid playfulness with relish. (In a way the original show was a Burton vehicle decades ahead of schedule.) The directors own curse is that his knack for visual invention has always been shadowed by hapless storytelling -- has he made a film that has kept it together all the way through? (Yes ""Edward Scissorhands"" and ""Ed Wood."" Any others?)But TVs ""Dark Shadows"" was incoherent to start with a daily dose of eldritch fantasy with no beginning middle or end. The movie has just enough structure to tide us over -- for the most part; the last half-hour is a traffic jam of silly ideas like a werewolf out of nowhere -- but its the atmosphere and the riffs that matter. Is Victoria the new governess a reincarnation of Barnabass adored Josette or her ghosts flesh-and-blood pupil? Im not sure even Burton knows. What he responds to is the delicate purity of Heathcote in the cameras trembling close-ups and so do we. (With her wide unblinking eyes the actress could be the directors Corpse Bride sprung to life.)The best jokes lie in the gulf between the heros 18th-century grandiloquence -- hes Rochester with an overbite -- and the polyester 70s setting. Everything conspires against poor Barnabas His secret antechamber now houses Elizabeths macrame; the parlor organ now comes with a thump-chucka-thump rhythm box. When Carolyn recommends a rock star to play at a Collinswood ball the host is startled to learn that Alice Cooper isnt a woman. Depp has the most fun hes had with a role outside of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" series and he luxuriates in the characters hambone dialogue. This new world baffles him with its lava lamps and bluntness its lack of dark poetry. Yes Barnabas kills people and drinks their blood but at least he has manners.""Dark Shadows"" weighs a ton but is surprisingly fast on its feet and there are flashes of the whackadoo genius that animated early films such as ""Beetlejuice"" made before Burton was an industry and an institution. The new movie means exactly nothing and it should evaporate long before it does but its maker is re-energized by all the old horror stories he loves for their cheapness and dread. Why shouldnt he stride into Collinswood with such flair? Hes home.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. Follow him on Twitter tyburr. (c) Copyright 2012 Globe Newspaper Company.

Dark Shadows Year 2012 Director Tim Burton Studio Warner Bros. Pictures Actors Johnny Depp Michelle Pfeiffer Eva Green Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture First of all dark shadows? What other kinds are there? Second of all if every middle-aged person who waxes nostalgic about the soap opera had actually been a frequent viewer the show would have lasted longer than it did -- 1225 episodes from June 22 1966 to April 2 1971 or a mere eyeblink in the multi-decade spans of some daytime dramas. Yet the series earned its immortality by adding vampires and ghosts to the usual TV-soap touchstones of infidelity amnesia unsuspected parentage evil twins and ham acting. Airing on ABC at 4 p.m. just before American Bandstand the show became after-school appointment viewing for hip youngsters of the Vietnam years. Apparently those addicted kids included Johnny Depp Tim Burton and Michelle Pfeiffer. Depp bought the rights to the show produced the new movie version and stars as the courtly vampire Barnabas Collins. Burton in his eighth collaboration with Depp signed on as director; and Pfeiffer who was the majestic-pathetic Catwoman in Burtons 1992 Batman Returns plays Elizabeth Collins Stoddard doyenne of the cursed Collinwood estate. (WATCH 20 Movies Were Looking Forward to in 2012) The directors affection is evident and his homage sometimes acute as in afternoon soaps many shots are medium closeups of the actors staring pensively off-camera (presumably at the Teleprompter). And besides stocking his cast with a quintet of siren-actresses Burton also graciously invited four of the original stars -- Jonathan Frid Lara Parker Kathryn Leigh Scott and David Selby -- to appear briefly in his film. But the new Dark Shadows is less a channeling of the show than an exercise in facetious Gothic reverie. Not that adaptors of the old series need feel reverence for it -- only reverence for their remembered pre-adolescence fandom. Sampled today in MPI Home Videos Dark Shadows The Complete Original Series whose 131 discs contain 470 hours of episodes and extras encased in a hexagonal-shaped coffin box (available in July for a mere 419.99 from Amazon.com) the show is creakier than it is creepy. Producer Dan Curtis and his crew shot the series live-on-tape on a miniscule budget; the bloopers (blown lines stagehands scurrying past the camera) have filled a blooper reel you can find on Netflix. (LIST Barnabas Collins in TIMEs Top 10 Screen Vampires) But the series pinchpenny atmosphere was part of its appeal. The show seemed as decrepit as Collinwood and the actors as chained to their roles as the characters were condemned to battle their internal infernal spirits. Eight months into its run Curtis introduced the vampire Barnabas (Frid) as a distant relative -- distant being the 18th century when a vengeful witch turned him into a vampire and consigned him to 200 sleepless years buried alive. Thanks to the mood shift from melodrama to Gothic horror and especially to Frids haunted grandeur Dark Shadows exuded a spooky sub-camp aroma for the next couple of years. (The show spawned two movie spinoffs in the early 70s and a 1991 prime-time remake starring Ben Cross as Barnabas Jean Simmons as Elizabeth 10-year-old Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Elizabeths grandson David and as Davids live-in psychiatrist veteran horror-film stunner Barbara Steele.) The new movie follows the original shows plot-bible with prefatory scenes set in the 18th century when young Barnabas journeys from Liverpool to the familys new home in a Maine fishing village soon to be renamed Collinsport. The boy has won the ardor of the low-born brunette Angelique but as he comes to young manhood he falls in love with the aristocratic blonde Josette DuPres (Bella Heathcote). Using some satanic powers she has mysteriously acquired Angelique (Eva Green) casts a spell that sends Josette to her death from a high cliff; and for bad measure she transforms Barnabas into a vampire and locks him alive in a coffin. He is inadvertently freed in 1972 by some workmen digging up the site. In a trice all 11 are dead drained. As Barnabas confesses ""You cannot imagine how thirsty I am."" (LIST Johnny Depp and Tim Burton in TIMEs Top 10 Actor-Director Pairings) He finds his beloved Collinwood in a state of disrepair that is dank fetid and truly fabulous-looking -- kudos to Rick Heinrichs production design and Bruno Delbonnes cinematography. While warily welcoming Barnabas Elizabeth tries supervising the truculent Collins brood her wastrel son Roger (Jonny Lee Miller) and his troubled boy David (Gulliver McGrath) and her teenage granddaughter Carolyn (Chloe Grace Moretz). Also on the premises are the psychiatrist Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter) a reprobate handyman (Jackie Earle Haley) and a young governess (Heathcote again) who calls herself Victoria Winters but is the exact image of Barnabas lost love Josette. The whole clan has been reduced to shabby-genteel poverty because the local fishing concession on which they once held a monopoly is now in the clutches of a take-charge blonde named Angie (Green again) -- or as we knew her from the movies first five minutes the witchly Angelique. A strange abode harboring stranger people Burton has lived there for ages. His 1988 Beetlejuice unleashed a dead couple on the new inhabitants of their home; and the 1990 Edward Scissorhands imported the blade-fingered man-doll (Depp) into a suburban tract house. The Dark Shadows family bitches and moans at meals no less than the Beetlejuice interlopers did -- though at breakfast in an egregious instance of product placement the Collinses are visually upstaged by a box of Wheaties. In Burtons two early films and in Ed Wood and Sweeney Todd The Demon Barber of Fleet Street he imparted a collective emotional urgency however crackpot to his characters missions. Here less is at stake the Collinses pain isnt made palpable and the fun the movie means to have isnt all that funny. (MORE Corliss review of the Depp-Burton Sweeney Todd) Two screenwriters are credited John August who worked on Burtons Big Fish Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Corpse Bride and his replacement Seth Grahame-Smith author of the mashup novels Pride and Prejudice and Zombies and Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter (the movie version of which will open next month). Perhaps it was Grahame-Smiths idea to devote so much screen time to Barnabas slow indoctrination to kooky artifacts of the 1970s Americas all-time tackiest decade. Get it? Theyre weirdly new to him but hilariously old-fashioned to us That trope cues a few laughs -- as when Barnabas first gazes on a TV set that is showing Karen Carpenter singing ""Top of the World"" and exclaims ""What sorcery is this? Reveal yourself tiny songstress"" -- but quickly exhausts itself. Finally the movie must turn its attention to telling an actual story of Barnabas rekindling of his love for Victoria-Josette and his centuries-long battle with Angie-Angelique. Though Barnabas speaks sepulchrally of ""the all-consuming void the dark shadows of the soul"" Depp seems to be viewing his character from the outside impressed and even more amused. In its joshing tone the actors portrayal of Barnabas is similar to his take on another antique fop Jack Sparrow from the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. The pain that Depp managed to invest in Edward Scissorhands Ed Wood and Sweeney Todd is absent here; the performance is expert but empty. (MORE Corliss on Matthew Bournes ballet of Edward Scissorhands) So why see Dark Shadows on a weekend when The Avengers beckons you for a second look? Five reasons and theyre all females. Each of the actresses in the cast looks great and star-acts up a perfect storm. Pfeiffer still a cool dream of womanhood at 53 presides over Collinwood with an imperious weariness. Moretz now 15 will never again be the ravishing and ravaging vampire girl of Let Me In and she isnt given much more to do here than sulk noisily but were always glad to see her. Bonham Carter in her fifth film with her at-home partner Burton nails the neurotic edginess of a shrink whos sexually beguiled by a very sick patient (Barnabas). Heathcote an Aussie teen has a pristine poise to complement her pre-Raphaelite beauty. Best is Green who was Daniel Craigs Vesper Lynd in Casino Royale and whom I promise I will some day stop calling the most gorgeous woman in pictures. Of all the temptresses in Dark Shadows Green most acutely understands how to play for both humor and horror. In dark hair or light as an 18th-century witch-goddess or a 20th-century entrepreneuse she seizes the screen and seduces the moviegoer even as Angie entices Barnabas into a one-time sex romp that lifts them up the walls of her office and cracks a lot of crockery. Does this principled vampire resist the demons attempts to make him endure her erotic torments through all eternity? Then the mesmerized viewer says ""Take me please"" (MORE Corliss on Eva Green in Perfect Sense) All right so Burton has made less a revival of the old show than a hit-or-miss parody pageant. This could be the pricey video record of a masquerade weekend that a group of bored glamorati spent in a rented mansion after someone had brightly proposed ""Lets play Dark Shadows"" But attention must be paid to movie allure in a star like Depp and his current harem. Angelique may be the only satanist among the women here but theyre all bewitching.

(AP Photo/Warner Bros. Peter Mountain) Johnny Depp like Robert Downey Jr. has profited handsomely from cartoonish characters. Captain Jack Willy Wonka the Mad Hatter -- theyre all larger-than-life zanies. The last two times that Depp played recognizable humans were in ""The Tourist"" and ""The Rum Diary"" both of which got keelhauled at the box office so it seems that if he wants his career to last forever hes cursed to wear the straitjacket of a garish goofball.Thats why he relies on his favorite tailor Tim Burton. The gilded star and the goth director have made eight movies together. If the atrocious ""Alice in Wonderland"" represented a couple in a rut ""Dark Shadows"" is a resurrection. This campy vampire flick runs like a well-oiled machine.Depp plays an 18th century dandy named Barnabas Collins whose Liverpool parents move to Maine and build a fishing empire. When Barnabas spurns witch Angelique (Eva Green) she turns him into a vampire who will dwell in an underground penalty box until he changes his mind. In 1972 the casket is uprooted by a construction crew at Collinwood Manor. Claiming to be a long-lost cousin Barnabas moves in with the dysfunctional family Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (a welcome return by Michelle Pfeiffer) her scheming brother Roger (Jonny Lee Miller) hippie teen Carolyn (Chloe Moretz) and troubled lad David (Gully McGrath). Also on hand are Dr. Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter) a live-in child psychologist; creepy caretaker Willie (Jackie Earle Haley); and governess Victoria (Bella Heathcote) -- who is the spitting image of Barnabas lost love Josette.Barnabas awakening and his interest in Victoria inflames the passions of Angelique who lives as a business rival to the Collins family.The convoluted plot about Barnabas restoring the family fortune and learning to love as a mortal is just an excuse for gags that are both tongue-in-cheek and toothless. Subverting the vibe of the 1966-71 TV soap opera ""Dark Shadows"" is as gracious and groovy as an Austin Powers parody. Better-than-ever Depp delivers the quips in the script by Seth Grahame-Smith on a deadpan platter. Surrounding Depp is a stellar supporting cast delightfully gimmicky sets and a guilty-pleasure soundtrack.""Dark Shadows"" may be too light for vampire purists or fans of the original show but fresh blood is just what the doctor ordered.

"Dark Shadows (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Dark Shadows (PG-13) Tim Burtons big-budget reimagining of the cult TV soap opera is a gothic mess. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com5/10/2012 Editor rating 2 For a good while Dark Shadows -- Tim Burtons big-budget reinvention of the late-1960s gothic TV soap opera -- gets your hopes up. The film opens at a brisk sweeping pace In 1772 a spurned witch turns the aristocrat Barnabas into a vampire and seals him in a tomb so he will suffer forever for not loving her. Two hundred years later he is accidentally freed and is forced to adjust to the 1972 era of love-ins hippies and red lava lamps (to him they look like ""pulsating blood urns."") Johnny Depp plays Barnabas with an amusing mixture of curious befuddlement -- hes intrigued by everything even paved roads -- and a quiet polite menace (""It is with sincere regret that I must now kill all of you"" he apologizes to the affable stoners who are about to become his dinner). Depp sports a death-pallor complexion and supernaturally long creepy fingers but his face isnt buried under elaborate makeup so you can enjoy his not-quite-campy performance (he does so much with his eyes). Burton a director who is often so distracted by the art design of his movies that he forgets to tell a story initially keeps Dark Shadows grounded and modest. The special effects are subtle (even the opening credits are surprisingly plain like a TV movie) and the cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel (Amelie) is gorgeously somber. The jokes are witty and rely on word play as much as visual gags. As Barnabas acquaints himself with the family who now lives in his former mansion -- including the matriarch Angela (Michelle Pfeiffer) her rebellious daughter Carolyn (Chloe Grace Moretz) and a psychiatrist (Helena Bonham Carter) -- Dark Shadows seems to be building toward a wonderfully sinister comedy of manners. Here finally you think is a Depp-Burton movie worthy of Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood their first and still best collaborations. And then the wheels come off and the film falls to pieces. Depp and Burton are two gifted like-minded artists whose affinity for oddball characters and humor makes them natural creative partners. But they also enable each others laziest most indulgent habits Too often they seem to be making movies to entertain themselves instead of the audience. Dark Shadows isnt as dull as Alice in Wonderland or as inert as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory but this one hurts more than those did because the potential was so great. As Angelique the ageless witch driven mad by her unrequited love Eva Green is seductive and sexy and serpentine Shes stunningly beautiful but shes also dangerous and when she gets angry her beautiful complexion cracks like porcelain. You keep waiting for the script by Seth Grahame-Smith (Pride and Prejudice and Zombies) to do something with the character more other than using her as the villain who must be vanquished. When Angelique gets to have a bit of fun in the sack with Barnabas their sexy rumpus (scored to Barry White) demolishes an entire room. The scene is funny but it doesnt pay off or lead to anything. Green isnt playing a character Shes just a foil for Depp. The same goes for Pfeiffer who is criminally wasted and Moretz who seems destined for stardom and even Carter who makes the most of her brief screen time in a rare (for her) turn as a relatively sane woman. By the time Dark Shadows reaches its ridiculous CGI-laden climax the movie has tromped on all its subtle pleasures in pursuit of special effects and explosions and fake-looking monsters. Like Alice in Wonderland the movie seems destined to be a box office hit. And Burton and Depp will descend even further down their rabbit hole no doubt coming up with another hoary property to plunder and modernize for their own amusement instead of coming up with something new and fresh and fun. Too bad for them and too bad for us. Cast Johnny Depp Michelle Pfeiffer Eva Green Chloe Grace Moretz Jackie Earle Haley Helena Bonham Carter Jonny Lee Miller Alice Cooper. Director Tim Burton.

(Shes gotten there by riding Amtrak while we listen to ""Nights in White Satin"" which is somehow exactly right.) Vicky whose real name is something else entirely has always been a strange girl who sees things and who is dramatically out of step with the pot-smoking rock n roll youth culture of today (and by today I mean 1972). A strange force has drawn her hither Could it be the bizarre charisma of the undead monstrosity who (as we already know) lies entombed and enchained almost beneath her feet?

I had already suspected I was going to love ""Dark Shadows"" even before that moment. But thats when I knew it for sure.Theres no doubt that Burtons ""Dark Shadows"" has issues and it will probably be considered a misfire in many quarters. Its so incredibly specific -- in its detailed recall of the original late-60s ""Dark Shadows"" soap opera (truly one of the strangest series in television history) its finely honed hambone acting by Johnny Depp Michelle Pfeiffer and Helena Bonham Carter and its campy but affectionate treatment of its Nixon-era setting -- that its hard to tell who the intended audience is. Me evidently along with other relics of that era and longtime ""Dark Shadows"" fans whove been waiting -- and waiting and waiting -- for Barnabas Collins to be exhumed yet again along with his lugubrious extended family. (Well talk about the doomed 1991 series some other time OK?) But I honestly dont know what sense it will make to people who show up because Johnny Depp and Tim Burton made a vampire comedy and that sounds cool. This ""Dark Shadows"" clearly leaves the sepulcher door ajar -- nay gaping wide open -- for potential sequels. But its such an odd movie and its facing the triumphalist superhero tidal wave of ""Avengers."" Disaster is definitely possible so Im not holding my breath.Anyway heres the principal issue I see with Burton and screenwriter Seth Grahame-Smiths (he of ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"") strange blend of nostalgia farce and spooky-loo Total delicious goodness Oh sure it all comes unglued in the final 15 minutes when like all Hollywood movies the story devolves into CGI fight scenes and stuff blowing up. But ""Dark Shadows"" offers potent atmosphere and delirious 70s fashions and hilarious gags and some really terrific performances none better than Pfeiffers triumphant return to the screen as a pitch-perfect family matriarch. This film seems to engage Burtons attention and imagination as no movie has since -- well a very long time ago. You can definitely make a case for his 2007 version of ""Sweeney Todd"" and the animated ""Corpse Bride"" is more enjoyable than most of Burtons live-action films but so much of his career -- like that of Depp his good friend and muse -- has been expended on stylish resuscitations of moribund pop-culture properties that look great but just go through the motions storytelling-wise.That Schwinn bike outside Collinwood is a good way of explaining the delicate balance Burton and Grahame-Smith try to strike here. This ""Dark Shadows"" seeks to be just as melodramatic and claustrophobic and ridiculous as Dan Curtis original series -- which only introduced its supernatural elements out of desperation in an effort to raise abysmal ratings -- but not exactly in the same way. Yes the self-aware camp factor has been turned way up and that will no doubt displease some original fans. When Depps Barnabas an 18th-century gentleman vampire is first loosed from his 200-year imprisonment by a road construction crew he marvels at the towering luminescence above him clearly the work of Mephistopheles (the golden arches of a McDonalds). Later upon glimpsing Karen Carpenter on TV he is disturbed and beguiled ""What sorcery is this? Reveal yourself tiny songstress"" Curtis show certainly never contained internal gags of that sort but from the audience point of view it was a camp object even at the time; its goodness and badness and creepiness and sex appeal were always intertwined and inextricable.If youre too young to have seen the original ""Dark Shadows"" -- which remained a daytime staple in reruns well into the 1980s and is now available on DVD in (almost) its 1245-episode entirety -- or just arent wired that way explaining its importance may not be possible. The main thing to point out is the immensely different cultural context in which the show emerged. Barnabas Collins predates not just ""Twilight"" and ""True Blood"" but also Anne Rices ""Interview With the Vampire"" and the entire rise of the Goth sensibility. In the 1970s vampires were something that only marginal weirdos who went to science-fiction bookstores and watched Hammer films like ""Dracula Prince of Darkness"" knew about. People like the teenage Tim Burton in other words. (Christopher Lee who played Dracula in seven Hammer movies has a cameo role here at least his fifth performance for Burton.) You Might Also Like Many of us unlucky enough to be conscious during the 1970s were desperate for markers of cultural difference and ""Dark Shadows"" offered a big one in the years before punk rock. If you were into that show you probably listened to records by Alice Cooper and the Rolling Stones and the Velvet Underground. You read Tolkien and Harlan Ellison. You also watched ""Star Trek"" an extremely different kind of show with some odd similarities. (Each became more popular after their cancellation; each starred a Canadian Shakespeare actor -- William Shatner and Jonathan Frid respectively -- who took a low-paying TV gig that would define the rest of his life.) You probably knew the guy in your town who sold Acapulco Gold and Panama Red.But I wouldnt make an argument for ""Dark Shadows"" purely on context and significance and Depp and Burton dont either. Curtis show made a virtue out of poverty and while that might not have been entirely new in pop culture it sure felt that way. Wobbly sets flubbed lines and wandering stagehands became part of its live-to-video appeal (nothing was ever shot twice) but the zero-tech effects stilted dialogue and noodly score (by Robert Cobert) were often surprisingly powerful. After Barnabas was loosed from his coffin about a year into the series the storytelling became increasingly unhinged and improvisational -- there were werewolves zombies witches and time travel -- and the shows long arc featured two long detours into two different past centuries along with parallel and contingent universes that might befuddle Stephen Hawking. It was all made up on the fly of course and didnt necessarily make sense but theres no question it fired the imagination of a generation Burton and Quentin Tarantino and Joss Whedon and J.J. Abrams and countless others. Burton and Grahame-Smith essentially build a series of affectionate riffs on the characters and situations of the original series and personally I can only wish there were a lot more of it. The aforementioned Vicky Winters bears an uncanny resemblance to Barnabas long-ago lost love Josette who was driven to suicide by Angelique (spectral French actress Eva Green still awaiting her moment of Hollywood stardom) the comely witch he spurned who then sought gruesome revenge. Indeed when Barnabas returns to 1972 Collinwood and divulges his secret to the resolute Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Pfeiffer) and then to drunken zaftig New York psychiatrist Julia Hoffman (Bonham Carter hilariously mimicking the mannered performance of the late Grayson Hall in the original) he soon discovers that Angelique has endured into the 20th century as well -- and like all women still wants him.Is it inherently bizarre and pointless that Burton has spent millions of dollars on a studied postmodern attempt to both emulate and parody something that was made on the cheap and that essentially parodied itself at the moment of its creation? I dunno. If you rely on Susan Sontags famous definitions of camp the original ""Dark Shadows"" would count as naive or ""Pure Camp"" whereas Burtons film can only be ""Camp which knows itself to be Camp"" which Sontag says is less satisfying. Im not sure these distinctions hold up personally and I see no moment of innocence in pop cultures past. Burton and Depp have made this film out of a pure deep passion for something that was created 40 years ago for entirely pragmatic reasons -- a desire to keep a TV show on the air and get paid for it -- and then fed on its own nuttiness and the publics almost erotic appetite for something new. In so doing they may have created a movie thats meant for a mass audience but that only a few people will enjoy the way they do. (The ""Cable Guy"" of vampire movies perhaps.) A mistake and a failure? Maybe. But isnt that a wonderful twist to the tale? Follow More Andrew OHehir.

"Dark Shadows movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Dark Shadows a not so after-school special ??TV show that boomer kids loved returns as a pricey but low-energy filmMay 10 2012|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticJohnny Depp stars in ""Dark Shadows.""Some of director Tim Burtons costume parties are livelier than others and the new ""Dark Shadows"" -- from the man who gave us ""Edward Scissorhands"" ""Sweeney Todd"" ""Alice in Wonderland"" and other chalkface-makeup spectaculars starring Johnny Depp -- feels like a place-holder a meandering first draft of an adaptation of the supernatural soap opera that ran on ABC-TV from 1966 to 1971.Are we simply fanged out? Certainly global popular culture has drained an awful lot of blood in recent years making it more challenging for the ""Dark Shadows"" screenwriter Seth Grahame-Smith (""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" and ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"") to seduce an audience whether that audience is new to the Barnabas Collins mythology or old pals of the series. ""Dark Shadows"" illustrates the fine line in a pop reboot between ""relaxed"" and ""lazy.""For all his prodigious imagination director Burton often has trouble when it comes to name brands and story momentum. In ""Dark Shadows""scene after scene find Depp Michelle Pfeiffer Eva Green Helena Bonham Carter and Chloe Grace Moretz all dressed up and ready to play only to be left high and dry by the material.The central joke of the picture -- that long-buried Barnabas awakens from his 200-year hiatus to find himself in the strange new world of 1972 -- is good for a few bits as when Barnabas is seen devouring a hardback edition of ""Love Story."" Few movie stars can add nonverbal detail or idiosyncratic comment arched eyebrow or not the way Depp can. (Whats this frozen waffle you place before me?)And yet I wonder if the ongoing Depp/Burton collaboration has its pitfalls. Depp often settles for posing and making droll faces in reaction-shot mode instead of building an eccentric comic portrait of any size. I long for the energy and invention of a performance such as Depps Ed Wood in Burtons""Ed Wood."" But then that wasnt a 125 million international export.The prologue of ""Dark Shadows"" plays it relatively straight. The witch Angelique (Green the best thing in the movie) curses Barnabas prosperous heir to a fishery fortune on the coast of Maine and confines him to a coffin. The Nixon-era story relates to competing fishing concerns between the remaining Collins clan headed by Pfeiffer and the undead stunner played by Green. Barnabas arrives as the long-lost relative. Characters wander around vaguely put out by other characters. The preteen boy David (Gulliver McGrath) has a ghost for a mother and Barnabas becomes his protector and savior. Hippies are devoured in one of the better scenes -- a deadpan campfire sequence in which Barnabas wonders who these freaks are exactly.The series wasnt like anything else on television in its day though the old ""Dark Shadows"" owed much to the Hammer horror vibe (toned down for the network) of the same eras big-screen vampire outings. Burtons ""Dark Shadows"" isnt slovenly in terms of craft or technique; its nicely cast and has its moments. But it feels extremely familiar and oddly impersonal for a project inspired by both Depps and Burtons youthful obsession with the show.mjphillipstribune.comDark Shadows -- 2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for comic horror violence sexual content some drug use language and smoking)Running time 200Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated Articles""Dark Shadows"" What the critics think of Johnny Depps...May 11 2012Shadows still draws devoted fans and Johnny Depp tooOctober 26 2007Dark Shadows reinterprets a favorite show from its...March 27 2012""Dark Shadows"" TV star Jonathan Frid dies at age 87April 21 2012Dark Shadows TV star Jonathan Frid dies at age 87April 21 2012Find More Stories AboutTim BurtonDark ShadowsBarnabas CollinsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0508-dark-shadows-20120510,0,4747332.column",200,darkshadows31,darkshadows,chicagotribune

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Somewhere in the sloping arc of Tim Burtons career what was once a sensibility slowly morphed into a brand. That distinctive gothic flair freed from horror and animated by comedy in great films like Pee-wees Big Adventure and Beetlejuice has not gone away nor has his attraction to stories about imaginative outcasts misunderstood by the squares around them. But whats gone missing in recent years--Sweeney Todd excepted though Stephen Sondheim had a hand in that--is the spiky wit and purposefulness that used to accompany that unmistakable visual style. Theres no doubt that viewers still know that theyre watching a Tim Burton movie. The question now is why. Adapted from the long-running gothic soap opera of the same name--though loosely in letter if not also in spirit as any sane adaptation of a 1225-episode run would be--Burtons Dark Shadows combines fish-out-of-water comedy with a love triangle that spans two centuries and threatens to replay itself for all eternity. The two elements require a delicacy of touch because theyre often at war with each other Injecting real feeling into an irony-choked camp comedy causes the sort of tonal distress that the old Burton might have resolved. But the Burton of today has a much easier time with the lighter work of thrusting a 200-year-old vampire into the world of shag carpets lava lamps and The Carpenters than stirring up emotions that have the weight of time and longstanding romantic feuds embedded in them. Naturally Dark Shadows fares best in its first half when its least troubled and can score the most jokes. Opening in 1760 the film quickly dispatches with the tortured mythology of the Collins family which left for the New World and established itself on a Maine seaport where it staked such a claim in the seafood business that the town was named Collinsport. Back at Collinwood Manor their vast estate on a cliff over town young Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) finds himself the subject of conflicting passions between the vengeful witch Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green) and his true love Josette (Bella Heathcote). In a fit of jealousy Angelique has Josette toss herself off a cliff and turns Barnabas into a vampire condemning him to eternal torment in a chained-up coffin buried 6 feet underground. Cut to 1972 when the story threatens to play itself out again. Victoria Winters (also played by Heathcote) Josettes spitting image finds herself mysteriously drawn to Collinsport for a job nannying a troubled young Collins boy. Meanwhile Angelique has used the previous centuries to take over the seafood industry and crush Barnabas heirs who now have turned Collinwood Manor into a musty old rattrap with a drunk caretaker (Jackie Earle Haley). When construction workers accidentally unearth Barnabas the old vampire returns to Collinwood and makes peace with its matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Michelle Pfeiffer) under the proviso that he keep his monstrous nature a secret. Once he gets his bearings Barnabas seeks to return the Collins family to its former glory while renewing his rivalry with Angelique and falling for the prim mysterious Victoria. Working from a script by Seth Grahame-Smith--whos made a cottage industry out of giving the classic or historic a modern genre kick in novels like Pride And Prejudice And Zombies and Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter--Burton mines the culture-clash comedy for all its worth contrasting Barnabas old-fashioned formality with the liberated spirit of early-70s America. The jokes are easy pickings but they score anyway thanks to Depps befuddlement in the face of a McDonalds sign or a troll doll his assessments of everything from Scooby Doo (""This is a very silly play"") to Love Story and his peculiar ideas about love and the essentiality of dowries and ""birthing hips."" Depp plays Barnabas as an infectiously enthusiastic go-getter--at least as enthusiastic as a doomed bloodsucker can be--and his optimism gives the Collins clan a sense of purpose and the film a sense of fun. But any proper adaptation of Dark Shadows even one that acknowledges and celebrates its camp silliness as much as Burtons does has to immerse itself in soap opera too and its here that the directors lack of conviction becomes apparent. Barnabas is a helpless romantic at heart--he even has a spirited session with Angelique--and the story is knotted up with tempestuous affairs and a love that transcends mortal boundaries. Thats the fundamental appeal of a supernatural soap opera after all Humans can only love for a finite amount of time but a vampire like Barnabas can keep the embers burning after the flesh goes cold. Burton goes through the motions but as much as he feels at home among this family of misfits and beasts Dark Shadows doesnt have the conviction to give the romantic intrigue any life. Once the laughs dry up in the final third Burton reverts to a loud protracted finale that shows off his dexterity with special effects but at the expense of all other considerations. And that in a nutshell is the problem with Burton of late Hes grown as a technician as skillful with CGI as he was once with stop-motion but his technique has become as bloodless as poor Barnabas--and a fraction as passionate.

Peter Mountain) <<123>> In Theaters This Week Get showtimes watch movie trailers SOUTH BAY Search showtimes theaters EAST BAY Search showtimes theaters The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel Dark Shadows Darling Companion First Position God Bless America Last Call at the Oasis The Perfect Family Sound of My Voice Opening Wednesday The Dictator Tim Burtons reboot of the trippy soap opera ""Dark Shadows"" isnt the campy comedy its trailer leads us to believe.And therein lies the problem ""Shadows"" starring Burton regular Johnny Depp as iconic bloodsucker Barnabas Collins doesnt know what in the heck it wants to be flitting around like a mindless bat from naughty comedy to watered-down horror show to loud action flick. At one point it even appears to emulate that macabre 1992 comedy ""Death Becomes Her.""All that genre hopping results in a production thats completely toneless -- a big disappointment considering its potential. Its got a great cast and Burton actually does nail many artistic details thanks to the masterful efforts of photography director Bruno Delbonnel and production designer Rick Heinrichs.In fact many signature elements that made the 1966-1971 show so addictive get splendidly polished the wild surf crashing onto those black rocks the Gothic look of Collinwood Manor and that weird hypnotic music. There are even cameos from the original cast including the late Jonathan Frid who played Barnabas and a curious appearance by rocker Alice Cooper.But halfway through ""Shadows"" goes way off the rails resorting to cheap sex jokes and overbloated action. The tide turns when the 18th-century Barnabas unearthed by construction workers tangles with his lusty female nemesis Angelique (a game bewitching Eva Green). Their grudge match deals a hefty blow to the 1972 Maine fishing town of Collinsport where the out-of-touch stiff-collared Barnabas meets his blood relatives who are altogether ooky kooky and a touch like ""The Addams Family.""Advertisement Theres also a derivative tone to much of ""Shadows"" the eighth collaboration between Burton and Depp signaling again that the once dynamic duo is slumping into a predictable pattern. As with ""Alice in Wonderland"" quirky flourishes sprinkled in here and there raise the game -- just not enough.Depp remains charming funny and sexy as usual. He plays Barnabas as a fish-out-of-water but the performance has a whiff of deja vu. You cant help but wish hed return to the risk-taking Johnny of ""Whats Eating Gilbert Grape?"" and find juicier material to sink his fangs into. Initially the screenplay by hotshot screenwriter Seth Grahame-Smith (""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"") and John August (""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"") shows promise juxtaposing humor (hippies in a VW bus offering Barnabas a ride) with horror (Barnabas slaying construction workers).A prologue swiftly recaps the convoluted soap opera back story about how Barnabas was cursed into becoming a vampire in the 18th century by the witchy Angelique and how she hypnotized Barnabas true love -- Josette -- to jump off a cliff.At first the scenes in which Barnabas awakens more than 200 years later to a world of TVs and cars are humorous even laugh-out-loud funny but they become tiresome after a while. The cast tries the best it can but their characters arent fully fleshed out. The notable exception is Michelle Pfeiffer who is spot on and stunning as Elizabeth Collins a matriarch trying to keep up appearances. Helena Bonham Carter as the often-soused psychiatrist Dr. Julia Hoffman isnt given enough screen time and I found myself missing her signature wacky ways.Others in the family fare a bit worse Chloe Grace Moretz who plays Carolyn Elizabeths temperamental 16-year-old daughter is trying way too hard. Jonny Lee Miller is all but wasted as Elizabeths sticky-fingered brother. And Gully McGrath as the young David who believes his dead mother is still haunting the manors halls is just well bland. Even poor Victoria Winters (Bella Heathcote) who is introduced early and sort of sets the plot into motion is nearly abandoned til the end. Speaking of the end ""Shadows"" leaves us with the sense that this isnt the last time well be seeing Barnabas and company. One can only hope that next time theyll work out the kinks.Dark Shadows   Rating PG-13 (comic horror violence sexual content some drug use language and smoking)Cast Johnny Depp Michelle Pfeiffer Helena Bonham Carter Eva Green Jonny Lee Miller Chloe Grace MoretzDirector Tim BurtonRunning time 1 hour53 minutesJohnny Depp He portrays Barnabas Collins in ""Dark Shadows.""Print Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Talend Silicon Valleys latest tech IPO has a strong debutSource Tesla looking at cameras radar in Florida crashCartoons Hillary Clinton makes history Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr GHOULISHLY ENDEARING Johnny Depp gets his freak on in Dark Shadows B+ Dark Shadows Genre Drama; Starring Helena Bonham Carter Johnny Depp Eva Green Jonny Lee Miller Michelle Pfeiffer Alice Cooper; Director Tim Burton; Release Date Wide 05/11/2012; Runtime (in minutes) 112; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted May 15 2012 -- 1200 AM EDT When you go to see Tim Burtons Dark Shadows a baroquely droll and Burtonized update of the gothic oddball vampire soap opera that ran on ABC from 1966 to 1971 it seems a fairly safe bet that Johnny Depp as Barnabas Collins will be the freakiest person on screen. He is but not in the way I expected. Barnabas born in the 18th century shows up in the fishing village of Collinsport Maine in 1972 after having spent 200 years in a coffin. Even amid the dope-happy wilted-flower-power decadence of the early 70s he cuts a distinctive figure. For openers hes a bloody killer The first thing he does is to slake his thirst by ripping into the throats of the workers who found his coffin. Hes also an incongruous aristocrat. In his regal long coat and ascot balancing himself on a wolfs-head cane he walks with stiff stately formality and his chalky skin and sunken eyes are set off by a hairdo of staggered bangs that makes it look as if hed just come from a Vidal Sassoon salon in Transylvania. Yet Barnabas at heart is really rather conservative. Hes sweet a touch recessive and not ultimately very threatening. Hes a courtly dandy a gentleman. After arriving at Collinwood Manor the moldering 200-room mansion that his descendants still occupy he meets Victoria (Bella Heathcote) the governess whos the reincarnation of the girl he once loved and he cant believe that shes known as Vicky. ""A name like Victoria is so beautiful"" he purrs in his plummy British accent ""that I could not bear to part with a single syllable of it."" And he means it In 1972 Barnabas is an archaic romantic nobleman out of Jane Austen. Hes not just undead; in the hippie-gone-glam era hes mind-bendingly uncool. Which ironically is what sort of is cool -- and freakish -- about him. Depps performance is more than just funny -- its ghoulishly endearing. He caresses each line with great care as if it were a piece of candy hes unwrapping and he gives Barnabas in his very ""demonic"" intensity a quality of almost elfin innocence that recalls the characters Depp has most memorably played for Burton Edward Scissorhands Ed Wood and Willy Wonka. But Dark Shadows entertaining as it is is a milder echo of those earlier collaborations. Burton references cheeky time-capsule artifacts (lava lamps Troll dolls macrame plant holders the board game Operation). He piles on period pop chestnuts like the Moody Blues ""Nights in White Satin"" and the Carpenters ""Top of the World"" and he stages a trippy grand ball presided over by Alice Cooper. I found a great deal of this stuff irresistible but Dark Shadows is likably skewed fun that at times is a little too knowing about being a piece of kitsch. The original Dark Shadows a tale of bloodsuckers told in the slightly depressed badly lit style of Days of Our Lives has fostered a cult over the decades but when I was a kid catching glimpses of it on TV I never knew quite what to make of its fusion of horror and banality. Burton working from a script by Seth Grahame-Smith thats stronger on dialogue than story devises his own goofy riffs on the material. Barnabas finds a home with his relatives who are basically one-note walking quirks Chloe Grace Moretz as an insolent teen brat Jonny Lee Miller as a dweebish scoundrel dad in a mod plaid jacket Helena Bonham Carter as a neurotic whiskey-swilling shrink and Michelle Pfeiffer as the levelheaded matriarch. The plot? Barnabas attempts to save the family fishery business -- which means that he must once again face down Angelique (Eva Green) the witch whose advances he spurned two centuries ago and who got her vengeance by placing the curse of vampirism upon him. She now runs the rival cannery in town. Green who had such a complex allure in Casino Royale here turns herself into an Samp;M vixen with a crooked leer of a smile. She and Depp have a supernatural sex scene (which gets a bit too gymnastic) but mostly she looks at him as if she wants to devour him and Green makes that seem like a sick version of romance. By the last act however her performance literally becomes a special effect her skin cracking like porcelain as she spews her toxic passion. Barnabas heart you see is too pure for Angelique. Hes saving himself for Victoria the otherworldly governess. Dark Shadows a kinky love triangle is true in its fashion to the spirit of the old soap opera. Yet its real love affair is between Johnny Depp and the audience whos still hooked on seeing him get his freak on.

I was skeptical about this particular project from the visual stunner Tim Burton but he managed to impress me again. Johnny Depp is of course on top of his game as Barnabas Collins. The movie mostly takes place in 1972 and is punctuated from music from that year. Highly entertaining and often hilarious. Another home run for Burton and Depp. Rob Kowalsaid on Monday May 21 2012 15530 PMWill somebody please stop letting Tim Burton do remakes They should have stopped him after he spewed his wretched ""Planet of the Apes"" remake at us He has no respect for the original films and shows and thus they come out crap. (Planet of the Apes Willy Wonka etc) Now I will admit Burton has made some timeless classics Pewees Big Adventure Edward Scissorhands Ed Wood (His finest film IMO) and Big Fish (his 2nd finest film.) However when he updates classics he never seems to have the proper respect and love for the original material. ""Ed Wood"" was wonderful because like myself he had a true love for the amazingly inept filmmakers boundless enthusiastic drive and uncanny ability to make the most unintentionally funny grade-z duds in the history of Hollywood. (""Plan 9""s only rival is Phil Tuckers ""Robot Monster"" and Eds own ""Glen or Glenda"". Even his Batman movies despite their Box Office were complete crap IMO because by his own admission he would never read a comic book. Johnny Depp use to be the entertainment worlds most underrated actor but except for creating film icon Jack Sparrow he just keeps teaming with Burton to do the same shtick over and over. Wear period costumes and wear white makeup and act odd. His last success at doing that was Burtons ""Sleepy Hollow"" which while not Burtonss finest film it still stands as worthy homage to Hammer Films which once again like Ed Wood he had the proper respect for what he was trying to pay homage to. Kathy Nunezsaid on Saturday May 12 2012 104837 PMThis movie was ridiculous What a disappointment This movie ruined the legacy of the Dark Shadows series and Barnabas Collins. The ONLY part of this movie I enjoyed was the split-second cameo appearance of Jonathan Frid the original Barnabas Collins....may he rest in peace. Dan Skip Allensaid on Saturday May 12 2012 93737 PMThis is my review of Dark Shadows From the Fourth Row Dale Herbestsaid on Friday May 11 2012 32957 PMAt this point I know exactly what would improve Tim Burtons output hold the Johnny Depp use a little less Helena Bonham Carter add a large dose of Tim Curry and drop on a dollop of Carrie Fisher. Thats the recipe for greatness. Jonathan Lemmonsaid on Thursday May 10 2012 90834 PMIve been looking forward to this movie since the first time I heard it was being made. And although I respect your opinion Im still going to see this as soon as I can. This is Tim Burtons first vampire movie in his entire career. And Im not alone when I say that weve all been waiting for Johnny Depp to play a vampire sometime in his life. We havent had a proper vampire film in a very long time (Eclipse being an exception). I feel that this movie could not only be a return for proper vampire moviemaking but also a comeback for Tim Burtons classic sense of humor that made him one of my favorite directors. You mentioned the PG-13 rating and Johnny Depps performances when it comes to 19th century style acting. I honestly dont mind any of that. Vampire violence is fun when its rated R but the PG-13 rating allows for more suspence instead of just cutting right to the neck-biting. I dont know if this movie focuses on suspence but I was just making a point. Johnny Depp is always exelent. Even when hes playing the same Victorian age bad boy he always delivers a different spin on his roles. And both he and Tim Burton are one of the few moviemaking duos who understand each other as if they were brothers. Scorsese and DiCaprio Spielberg and Hanks and Raimi and Campbell are a select three other examples that work extremely well together though. Johnny and Tim always know what their audiences want and they always deliver. I have a feeling that I will enjoy Dark Shadows very much as another entertaining Burton/Depp experience) Crazy Daveysaid on Thursday May 10 2012 60038 PMSeriously Johnny Depp has to STOP working with Tim Burton. THATS getting tiring. POST A COMMENT indicates required fieldName Email Website YouTubeResponse URL  ? Comment Enter text as shown NOTE Your comment will be approved before it is posted.

"Dark Shadows | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; dark-shadows ) Dark Shadows (United States 2012) May 09 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli Dark Shadows is a mess and its unclear whether its bizarre recipe of comedy campy horror and gothic melodrama will satisfy anyone regardless of their familiarity with the source material. By attempting to be too faithful to Dan Curtis cult TV series Tim Burton and his screenwriters have crammed an excess of story material into two hours without making a final decision about whether they want the resulting production to be a satire or an homage. The whiplash-inducing shifts in tone cause Dark Shadows to veer from hardcore Hammer horror to The Rocky Horror Picture Show and back again. And for those who care about the story it unfolds in such a scattershot manner that it is often pointless and frustrating to follow. Dark Shadows debuted on ABC daytime during the late 1960s and survived for five years and 1225 episodes holding down the end slot of the networks afternoon block of soap operas. Although the series never boasted tremendous ratings it proved to be popular with the 18-35 crowd and inspired a Star Trek-like devotion from aficionados. It was briefly revived as an early 1990s re-imagination on nighttime TV. The ultra-serious high budget retelling of the story starred Ben Cross as the central character vampire Barnabas Collins and also featured Joanna Going Jean Simmons and Joseph-Gordon Levitt. It took another two decades for avowed fans Tim Burton and Johnny Depp to bring this story to the big screen. However what was taken seriously in the late 60s and early 70s comes across as low comedy today; its almost impossible to watch the original Dark Shadows in 2012 and not laugh. However although a primarily comedic approach to the material (as was done with Starsky and Hutch or 21 Jump Street) seems warranted Burton chose to make his version of Dark Shadows in a mostly straightforward manner with occasional injections of over-the-top campiness and humor. Rather than blending artfully however the mixture curdles. The majority of the movie is set in 1972 following a prologue that transpires in the late 18th century. A young governess Victoria Winters nA(c)e Maggie Evans (Bella Heathcote) arrives at a gothic Maine manor to teach a troubled young boy who sees dead people. She is received warmly by the boys aunt Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Michelle Pfeiffer) but with some reticence by his father Roger Collins (Johnny Lee Miller) and his live-in doctor Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter). Shortly after Victorias arrival another newcomer knocks at the door to Collinwood Manor. He is Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) a 200-year old vampire who has escaped from the grave to restore the fortunes of his once-great family. Unfortunately for Barnabas the witch Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green) the jilted lover who cursed him all those years ago is alive and thriving and more than willing to resume their relationship where it left off. Dark Shadows is not entirely without its share of clever moments. The ironic use of music is a prime example. The Moody Blues ""Nights in White Satin"" plays over the opening credits Karen Carpenter is featured in a television appearance and Alice Cooper has a lengthy in-person cameo. Theres an energetic sex scene (accompanied by a Barry White song) that recalls a similarly destructive and acrobatic sequence from The Tall Guy although Dark Shadows PG-13 rating demands that it be toned down. (When Jeff Goldblum and Emma Thompson went at it they had the benefit of an R.) Had more of Dark Shadows achieved heights like those it might have been destined for greatness (or at least a positive review) but Burton exhibits unfortunate tendencies toward excessive reverence. He shoehorns as many subplots and characters as possible from the original series into the movie and it becomes exhausting to follow the narratives contortions. Its difficult to say whether fans will be thrilled since major changes have been made to established characters and relationships. Four of the original Dark Shadows actors make appearances including Jonathan Frid the original Barnabas who died shortly after filming the cameo. For Johnny Depp a longtime fan of the series playing Barnabas falls into the ""dream come true"" category which makes it disheartening to throw darts at his portrayal. Ever since attacking the role of Capn Jack Sparrow with gusto in the original Pirates of the Caribbean the fine actor of the 90s and early 00s has been replaced by a man with a penchant for over-the-top weirdness. His Barnabas is soulless but not because hes a vampire. Its because of the drag queen-like approach Depp employs to portray him. This works fine for the openly campy scenes but destroys moments that are intended to be taken seriously. Depps Barnabas belongs in The Munsters or The Addams Family. To her credit Eva Green vamps it up in a desperate attempt to keep up with Depp and for the most part manages it. When the two of them are together there are sparks. The rest of the cast is set adrift left to fend for themselves. Helena Bonham Carter seems like shes still playing Bellatrix Lestrange from the Harry Potter series. Chloe Grace Moretz has been typecast as a temperamental teen with supernatural problems. Dark Shadows greatest nod to vampire movies of the past is in the stunt casting of Christopher Lee as a sea captain. Regrettably he has less screen time than Alice Cooper. Dark Shadows biggest problem may be expectations. By being released at the outset of the 2012 summer season it has been fallaciously positioned as a so-called ""tent pole"" movie. In reality its an uneven and overlong resurrection of a long-dead TV series whose fan base is drawing Social Security checks and rarely goes to the movies. Also big things are now expected from the notoriously quirky Burton after his previous feature Alice in Wonderland became a bona fide blockbuster (Burtons second highest grossing film when adjusted for inflation after Batman). Dark Shadows would have been better placed in a less competitive market where its numerous flaws might be more easily ignored or forgiven. As it is in terms of audience appeal and box office impact the most appropriate analog for Dark Shadows might be Speed Racer.

Dark Shadows Bad Director Tim Burton. Cast Johnny Depp Michelle Pfeiffer Eva Green. Rating PG-13 for comic horror violence sexual content some drug use language and smoking. That pretty well describes ""Dark Shadows"" Tim Burtons take on the 60s Gothic soap opera which features Johnny Depp as a bleached-out Barnabas Collins. Its a cool-looking film and it has some sense of the creepy fun you would expect from Burton at least in places. But it seems hollow somehow false even by its own campy standards. Whats worse the story written by Seth Grahame-Smith and John August just doesnt try hard enough running out of ideas before its even halfway told. A prologue set in the 18th century establishes that like in the TV show Barnabas is turned into a vampire by Angelique (Eva Green) a witch whose love he rejects. She chains him and locks him in a coffin burying him alive. Cut to 1972 in Collinsport Maine the town founded by Barnabas parents. Collinwood Manor the ancestral home has fallen into disrepair the family fishing business has been largely usurped by a competitor and whats left of the Collins family no longer occupies a central role in the town; a bunch of outcasts is more like it. Elizabeth (Michelle Pfeiffer) struggles to keep the business afloat but she gets no help from her thieving brother Roger (Jonny Lee Miller). Her teenage daughter Carolyn (Chloe Grace Moretz) is rebellious in a 70s sort of way while Rogers son David (Gulliver McGrath) struggles to get over the drowning of his mother; he claims to see her ghost. The family has hired live-in psychiatrist Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter) to work with David but she mostly drinks the day away. Theyve also hired Victoria Winters (Bella Heathcote) as a governess. Then one night construction workers unearth Barnabas coffin and free him. Big mistake. Soon he is living in Collinwood Manor with only Elizabeth in on his secret. However his presence is soon discovered by the owner of the Collins competitor in the fishing business Angelique Bouchard -- the same Angelique that cursed Barnabas and his family centuries earlier. Fans of the TV series will recognize character names and note similarities to the original. Its somewhat promising up to this point with Barnabas vowing to win back both the family business and its good name. So now what? No one really seems sure. Burton relies on anachronistic humor -- Barnabas not understanding the world hes been released in -- to somewhat good effect mostly because Depp is good at that sort of thing. But a little goes a long way and you cant build a whole movie on it. Its probably silly to complain about lack of character development in a campy movie based on a soap opera but other than Barnabas and Angelique the other characters just sort of come and go popping up every now and then as needed nothing more. That said bonus points for not only including Alice Cooper (as himself) in the cast but for using the often-overlooked classic ""Ballad of Dwight Fry"" in an appropriate manner in a scene -- a rare case of the soundtrack being used to further the story and not as comic relief or cultural shortcut. The movie plays as if Hollywood executives said hey a ""Dark Shadows"" movie would be a fun project -- and never looked in on it again. Nowhere is the lack of discipline and structure more apparent than in the ending which is a mess -- and unlike most of the rest of the film not even an interesting one. From anyone this version of ""Dark Shadows"" would be a disappointment; from Burton its an even bigger one. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Pictures Johnny Depp and Tim Burton together again for a fun-enough makeover of an old TV favorite. TWITTER The latest 60s/70s TV show to get all dressed up as a fancy big-budget feature film Dark Shadows sinks its teeth half-way into its potentially meaty material but hesitates to go all the way. With an oddball premise thats right up his alley director Tim Burton has stylish fun with a morally-and-time-warped family visited by an undead 18th century relative as does Johnny Depp in the role of the antique British-accented vampire. But the humor slithers between the clever and the sophomoric and the film too often seems willing to settle for mild humor at the expense of hippie-era mores instead of pursuing the palpable temptation to become genuinely twisted. Still with its central bloodsucker vs. witch rivalry and Depp in one of his patented bizarre roles this has all the ear and tooth marks of an early summer winner for Warner Bros. Reportedly as a child Depps obsession with the elegant well-spoken romantically haunted central character Barnabas Collins was deep to the point of being all-consuming. Unsurprisingly the teenaged Burton was also a devotee of Dan Curtiss daily afternoon show which ran on ABC from 1966-71 and amassed 1225 individual episodes. This eighth collaboration between the actor and director affords Depp the opportunity to once again don unusual makeup and hair styles to become the white-faced plaster-maned vampire who rejoins the living in 1972 after having been entombed for nearly 200 years. PHOTOS Dark Shadows Red Carpet Premiere After a dockside Liverpool opening that makes it look like Burton is still making Sweeney Todd a five-minute prologue tells the tale of the Collins familys voyage to America their establishment of a fishing empire in Maine and heir Barnabas tragic love for the exquisite Josette (Bella Heathcote). The latter is made to fling herself off a cliff by the spurned witch Angelique (Eva Green) who then avenges herself against Barnabas by transforming him into a vampire and burying him six feet under. The workmen who discover and dig up Barnabas coffin in 1972 are thanked for the efforts by becoming his first victims -- he is he readily admits very thirsty--and he presently makes his way to his old home the grand Collinwood Manor now in a state of sorrowful disrepair as are its occupants. Matriarch Elizabeth (Michelle Pfeiffer) presides over a depressive eccentric household that includes her insolent naughty daughter Carolyn (Chloe Grace Moretz) no-good brother Roger (Jonny Lee Miller) the latters mother-bereft 10-year-old son David (Gully McGrath) Davids tippling shrink Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter) lowdown caretaker Willie (Jackie Earle Haley) and a newly arrived nanny Victoria who looks just like Josette of yore. And lo and behold the big boss in town whose own fishing operation has wiped the Collins company out is one Angie none other than the remarkably preserved Angelique just waiting for another chance to make old Barnabas her own. Given that the screenwriter here is Seth Grahame-Smith the author of Pride and Prejudice and Zombies and Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter much is made of bizarre conjunctures and unexpected associations; Barnabas must get used to everything from motorized vehicles hippies Carolyns rudeness and electricity to horror of horrors troll dolls and lava lamps. When he decides to throw a dress ball despite protestations that no one does this anymore he must also come to terms with an Alice who is not a woman but Alice Cooper engaged to entertain the motley townsfolk. Depp drolly underplays the refined vampires reactions to all this and more although the soundtracks frequent japes in this direction--playing ""Superfly"" the Carpenters ""Top of the World"" and a Barry White special -- at pointedly ironic moments -- ultimately tips the balance toward easy points rather than genuine inventiveness. PHOTOS 28 of Summers Most Anticipated Movies Upon meeting the demure Victoria Barnabas is convinced that he has been presented with a second opportunity for true love. In its pursuit he embarks upon blood transfusions administered by Dr. Hoffman that he hopes will return him to human status. At the same time however he needs all his power to battle Angie who will happily destroy half the town and put Barnabas back in his box again if he doesnt deign to join her in undying bliss. Especially after her frighteningly ferocious turns as Bellatrix Lestrange in the Harry Potter series it would have been easy imagine Burton casting his wife as Angie. In the event Bonham Carter proves a disarmingly droll choice as Dr. Hoffman a thick-around-the-middle New York shrink who develops an unhealthy interest in the new visitor. Greens stunning Angie her perfect teeth gleaming behind red scar lips looks like she could eat Barnabas alive at any moment; shes so much the full-time sorceress and hes so much the cultivated man of manners that it barely seems like a fair fight. But then vampires have their ways and the lethally attractive pair ultimately do get down to an especially athletic bout of extra-human sex before settling matters once and for all. Given that Burton has traded in such off-kilter oddly populated humorously horrible material so many times before there are few surprises in the way Dark Shadows has been handled tonally or visually. He could scarcely be more at home than at Collinwood Manor and some of the more ordinary characters including Victoria Roger and unfortunately the needy boy wonderfully played by McGrath seem to bore him and get short shrift. However Depp is right on the money in a studiously controlled steadfastly humorous performance that takes its rightful place in his personal portrait gallery of one-off misfits. Equipped with pointed fingers the actor successfully channels the roles creator Jonathan Frid who died just last month at age 87 while adding distinctive riffs and vocal intonations of his own. Hes a continual pleasure to watch. Pfeiffer and Moretz have their moments although a late plot twist concerning the latters character doesnt sit well. Shot entirely in England despite the New England setting the film is decked out with refined production values on a par with all of the directors work.

Pictures A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - A significant portion of Tim Burtons output over the past decade has been concerned with slipping the ""Burton treatment"" to susceptible texts Roald Dahls Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Stephen Sondheims Sweeney Todd Lewis Carrolls Alices Adventures in Wonderland--and now Dark Shadows.A supernaturally themed daily daytime soap Dark Shadows aired on ABC from 1966 to 1971 ruling the after-school time slot. Its story revolved around the family life of vampire Barnabas Collins a figure of purposeful aristocratic bearing and seductive decadence played by Jonathan Frid who died just weeks before the premiere of Burtons film. Shot one-take live-to-tape with all the attendant imperfections of blown lines wobbling candelabras and uncooperative stage doors the show can be reduced to camp merely the sum of its shoddy elements--but it also provided a generation of young Americans a glamorously gloomy antidote to the mainstream televised entertainment of the day personified by Love American Style and the Carpenters.Burton standby Johnny Depp fills the Barnabas role in this new film version which begins with a prologue narrated in a grave rumble by Depp that reveals the origin of the Collins curse. Leaving Liverpool a still-mortal Barnabas arrives with his parents in Colonial-era Maine where they build a commercial empire and establish the family seat Collinwood Mansion. As a young man Barnabas is torn between profane and sacred loves--with lowly servant Angelique (Eva Green) and hypergamous fiancee Josette (Bella Heathcote) respectively--and winds up with neither for the spurned Angelique practices black magic hexing Josette to death and Barnabas to endless suffering as a vampire imprisoned in a chained-up coffin and buried (eternally) alive.The bulk of Dark Shadows takes place in 1972 after Barnabas has been accidentally exhumed. Dazzled by paved roads and McDonalds Barnabas arrives at a half-ruined Collinwood to take his place at the head of what remains of his family--matriarch and distant cousin Elizabeth (Michelle Pfeiffer); her son and useless heir Roger (Jonny Lee Miller channeling John Saxon); his teenage sister Carolyn (Chloe Moretz); and Rogers troubled motherless child David (Gulliver McGrath) haunted by Mommys ghost. To deal with Davids issues two additional members of the household have been acquired psychiatrist Dr. Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter) and governess Victoria a spitting image of Barnabass lost love (also played by Heathcote). A less welcome familiar face is the magnate who has ruined the Collinses fame and fortune through the decades--none other than the eternal Angelique.This is a platoon of a cast few of whom have time to make much of an impression as in under two hours Burtons Dark Shadows must distill the essence of a 1225-episode story arc (recently released by MPI Home Video on 131 DVDs). If the actors shticks leave only faint impressions the art direction by Burton stalwart Rick Heinrichs reliably stamps itself on the imagination his Collinwood Mansion a masterpiece of ornamental fretwork octopi chandeliers and hidden passageways.More than its gothic tropes though Burtons Dark Shadows is committed to fish-out-of-water material--culture-clash humor that rummages through the collective thrift-store memory of the 70s. The films best moment features a cameoing Alice Cooper performing ""The Ballad of Dwight Fry"" in Collinwoods Great Hall tying together Barnabas and Cooper as kindred icons of heroic morose theatricality against square ""silent majority""-era America.More frequently this Dark Shadows relies on slow-pitch wasnt-the-past-dumb humor The 1970s are lampooned for macrame art and inane pothead conversation Love Story and lava lamps and the Steve Miller Band. The 1770s are held to ridicule through Barnabass florid language Romantic agony and droit du seigneur chauvinism. Significantly the screenplay is by Seth Grahame-Smith author of ""mash-up"" novels including Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter soon to be a major motion picture produced by Burton with a novelty concept whose bestseller popularity proves that our creatively anemic present aint none too smart neither.In the midst of all this is an unusually dandy bit of dress-up from Depp weaving his elongated Nosferatu fingers through the air recalling an exchange in 1994s Ed Wood. (""Bela how do you do that?"" ""You must be double-jointed. And you must be Hungarian."") Wood is still by far Depp and Burtons best collaboration exhibiting the balance of tone between kitsch parody and zealous fantasy thats missing in Dark Shadows less a resurrection than a clumsy desecration.The shadow of Alice Cooper also stretches across Bobcat Goldthwaits God Bless America another new film about beautiful monsters preying on American peasantry. According to Tara Lynne Barrs Roxy the philosophical half of this films murdering duo it was Cooper who ""gave us rock that upset authority figures and made the outcast feel not so all alone.""The outcast in God Bless America is Frank (Joel Murray)--a divorced fiftyish glumly alcoholic white-collar worker introduced on one of his sleepless nights entertaining homicidal fantasies about the couple next door. ""Theyre incapable of comprehending that their actions affect other people"" he muses before another night in front of the TV staring at uncivil reality programs and energy-drink ads with the same glassy eyes that Travis Bickle once cast over American Bandstand.In the next few days Frank will lose his job become completely estranged from his young daughter and be diagnosed with brain cancer. Its like a nihilistic parody of Akira Kurosawas 1952 Ikiru in which a fatally ill unloved middle-age bureaucrat played by Takashi Shimura is forced to find meaning in what life he has left. Shimuras character exchanges a wasted life for selfless action turning a cesspool into a public playground; Frank however decides to waste those responsible for the cesspool that America has become--starting with an ungrateful brat he sees on a program thats clearly based on MTVs My Super Sweet 16.A veteran Frank is a crack shot and quickly gains an admiring groupie in Roxy a high school classmate of his first victim who tags along to spur Frank into a program of cleansing cross-country killing targeting members of a Westboro Baptist Church-type group a bullying right-wing TV host Tea Partiers and even some nonpartisan assholes. (Lucky for Alice Cooper they dont seem to recollect that he voted for Bush.) I cannot remember an American movie that has painted such a vulgar picture of the pop-culture landscape since Idiocracy or Ghost World--the latter of which also curiously revolved around the mutually revitalizing relationship between a middle-age male misanthrope and a teenage female version of same though Frank is exceedingly careful to maintain decorum with the underaged Bonnie to his Clyde. (""So were platonic spree-killers?"" she asks disappointed.)The brief filmography of choke-voiced stand-up and God Bless America writer-director Goldthwait boasts some real black-comic accomplishments including 1992s Shakes the Clown--a dirty-joke burlesque of the spiritual cost of life in the comedy industry--and 2009s Worlds Greatest Dad with Robin Williams grappling over how to grieve the death of a son who hardly deserved grief.What Worlds Greatest Dad found in the friction between emotional and intellectual instincts and what God Bless America lacks is conflict. Goldthwaits latest doesnt interrogate Franks warped decency or his conviction that ""some folks just need killing"" and offers no significant reason to second-guess him at any time. The interplay between Murray and Barr is closely and carefully handled but when the monotonous squib-popping subsides the movie is often static and talky lapsing into criticism-hedging qualifications and anti-everything speechifying (""Nobody talks about anything anymore they just regurgitate everything they see on TV""). From the films blinkered POV there is no such thing as an ""innocent bystander"" and no perspective is available outside of the all-enveloping disgust of Frank Roxy and their doting creator who absolves their crimes while serving up paper targets and irreverent soundtrack cues.Goldthwait must understand the irony of a protagonist condemning a society ""where the weak are torn apart every week for our entertainment"" and ""nobody cares that they damage other people"" in a movie that revels in the slaughter of the unarmed. And he must understandably have thought that any flinch might crack his films deadpan. But whats less obvious is what this turkey shoot is meant to do aside from providing a like-minded audience the vicarious cathartic thrill of watching a douchebag apocalypse--which Piranha 3D did with more elan and no self-righteousness. God Bless America adopts the scorched-earth moral certitude and guiltless body count of the ""angry white male"" Reagan-era action movie while turning the jingoistic politics inside out. Its such a carefully studied parody you might think youre looking at the original.

For those of you whose supernatural show-watching begins and ends at Buffy dont sulk. Director Tim Burton knows you had to be there His big-screen adaptation more a fish-out-of-water comedy than a melodrama feels closer to the wider camp phenomenon of The Rocky Horror Picture Show as well as the filmmakers cozy brand of suburban horror. Anybody who vociferously complains about this--or a movie in which our baffled hero unearthed in 1972 calls a lava lamp a ""pulsating blood urn""--is determined to stake out no fun. Filled to bursting with voracious stares and high collars (and even an Alice Cooper cameo) Dark Shadows struts its glam harder than any film since Velvet Goldmine--again a good thing. Just as were getting used to Depps lovelorn vamp attempting a resuscitation of the family cannery business along comes Eva Greens sex-on-wheels succubus poured into a Bacall slouch to kick the movie into overdrive. Burton as usual is great on atmosphere and comic timing (these are his weirdest moments since Ed Wood) but less so at reining in an overcomplicated plot and dimly lit action scenes. You sense the project was forced into a high-octane summer mold; itll probably serve nicely as background for your Halloween bash.

Few director-star partnerships are as consistently eccentric or malleable as that of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp but even loyalists will detect an odor of mothballs clinging to their eighth bigscreen collaboration ""Dark Shadows."" Outfitting ABCs cult-worshipped occult-themed soap opera with super-slick production values and a tone that veers unsteadily between kooky comedy and gothic horror this bizarre but weirdly bloodless retro-camp exercise is neither funny nor eerie enough to seduce the uninitiated and will court bemused reactions at best from the series still-estimable fan following. Pics pedigree could intrigue auds for a spell but long-term B.O. bewitchment seems unlikely. Though short-lived by soap standards ""Dark Shadows"" (1966-71) garnered instant notoriety and lasting appeal by injecting supernatural elements into the popular daytime serial format. Decades before the ghoulish denizens of ""Buffy"" and ""Angel"" ""Twilight"" and ""True Blood"" series mastermind Dan Curtis introduced viewers to Barnabas Collins a 200-year-old vampire played with insinuating grace by Jonathan Frid. Burton and Depp have cited Curtis creation as a formative influence and together with scenarist Seth Grahame-Smith they have paid tribute to the shows legacy in predictably whimsical irreverent fashion. With a smirk and a wink the filmmakers have inflated an enduring relic into an extravagantly empty postmodern artifact an object lesson in the perils of camping up a property that had no shortage of camp appeal to begin with. Gone is the atmosphere of grave haunted solemnity that lent the series an irresistible conviction despite its melodramatic trappings and rudimentary special effects. In its place are lavishly detailed sets some mildly coarse sexual innuendo and one joke after another predicated on the supposed hilarity of a Victorian aristocrat trying to navigate the era of disco and free love. That would be Barnabas Collins (Depp) master of Collinwood Mansion situated near the seaside Maine town of Collinsport. A prologue shrouded in the gray mists of 1795 reveals how Barnabas spurns a jealous witch Angelique (Eva Green) who proceeds to send his true love (Bella Heathcote) to a watery grave. She then turns Barnabas into a vampire burying him in a coffin until some very unfortunate construction workers dig him up nearly two centuries later. Its 1972 technically a year after the TV show ended which is the films way of signaling that unlike prior bigscreen spinoffs (1970s ""House of Dark Shadows"" and 1971s ""Night of Dark Shadows"") this will be a reinvention rather than a continuation. After a nicely haunting credits sequence set to the Moody Blues ""Nights in White Satin"" the first of many period-specific tunes young governess Victoria Winters (Heathcote again) takes a position at Collinwood only to find that the venerable clan led by formidable matriarch Elizabeth (a fine Michelle Pfeiffer) has fallen on hard times. Fortunately Victorias arrival coincides with the resurrection of Barnabas who sets out to restore the Collinses and their failing fishery to their former luster. Pretending to be a distant English cousin the vampire moves in with Elizabeth and her feckless brother Roger (Jonny Lee Miller); her impudent teen daughter Carolyn (Chloe Grace Moretz); and Rogers troubled young son David (Gully McGrath). Also in residence are child psychiatrist Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter) a major series character upstaged here by a loud ginger wig; and hired help Willie Loomis (Jackie Earle Haley) whom Barnabas makes his personal Igor. All this unfolds with a peculiar absence of tension creepiness or mounting drama and most of the supporting characters seem to be present as a matter of name-checking obligation. In keeping with Burtons morbid-to-the-max aesthetic melanin is in short supply; even the non-undead characters look unreasonably pallid. That also goes for Angelique still alive beautiful and bent on either winning or destroying Barnabas after all these years; Green plays the character with memorably witchy flair projecting a mix of brassy humor and diabolical attitude the rest of the film only intermittently achieves. Burtons Collinwood is not an unpleasant place to pass the time. Bruno Delbonnel lenses the cavernous mausoleum of a set (designed by Rick Heinrichs) to look at once foreboding and inviting and Danny Elfmans score provides a gentle spooky caress. Yet the creative spirits haunting the place are strained and self-conscious; the largely mirthless fish-out-of-water jokes -- as when Barnabas overreacts to a Karen Carpenter TV appearance or politely disembowels a bunch of hippies -- strand the film somewhere between Austin Powers and Addams Family. The result is a picture too rude and out-there to reproduce the shows particular pleasures yet too stilted and tame by contempo standards to deliver much of a bite. Through it all Depp gives a typically committed exquisitely deadpan performance looking quite at home with his claws matted-down hair spikes and heavy eye-shadow and turning the characters archaic diction into a form of baroque music. As often happens when he gets his freak on the actor seems lost in a private world channeling ghosts whose frequency he alone can detect. Up until an f/x-laden climax that desperately conjures everything from ""Rebecca"" to ""Death Becomes Her"" Depp just about holds it all together unsurprisingly emerging as the pics most reliable element. Frid who died April 13 is one of several series vets making brief cameos in a party sequence also notably attended and fronted by Alice Cooper.
