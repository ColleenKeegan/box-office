Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A low-level lawyer mysteriously lands a high-price case. BOTTOM LINE A guaranteed crowd-pleaser thanks mainly to McConaughey in what could be a franchise-worthy role CAST Matthew McConaughey Ryan Phillippe Marisa Tomei LENGTH 159 In the midst of a deluge of high-concept multigenre motion-capture movies -- in 3-D -- comes ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" a low-concept single-genre film with live actors whose performances add the depth. Thats refreshing -- so much so that its tempting to call ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" a masterpiece. Its really just a solid courtroom drama but these days moviegoers should take what they can get. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Matthew McConaughey plays the title role Mick Haller a high-minded lawyer who defends lowlifes from the back of a shiny Continental. Given his client list of bikers and junkies Haller is surprised when a Beverly Hills rich kid named Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe not exactly stretching) retains him to beat an assault charge. The case turns out to be less than straightforward -- arent they always? -- and it triggers bad memories of an old client (Michael Pena) whose fate haunts Haller still. Even if the plot were spoiled here ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" would be worth seeing. McConaughey wears his roguish role as if it were bespoke; its a treat watching his Haller slither through backroom deals and elevator-ride negotiations. The terrific supporting cast includes Marisa Tomei as the (mostly) ex-wife and William H. Macy as a grizzled but razor-sharp private investigator. Directed by Brad Furman and written by John Romano (from the novel by former crime reporter Michael Connelly) ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" brims with authentic details zippy dialogue and colorful performances from even the smallest players. Things get a bit silly at the end -- dont they always? -- but its hard to stay mad when McConaughey is flashing that who-loves-you smile. CelebritiesMatthew McConaughey BACK STORYActor producer agree on role advertisement | advertise on newsday For the filmmakers of ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" the charismatic Matthew McConaughey was the ideal choice to play the title character maverick attorney Mick Haller. ""Matthew has always been one of my favorite actors and this role is perfect for him"" says producer Gary Lucchesi. ""We get to see him play all these qualities that made him a star to begin with a confident guy with a bit of a swagger and loads of charm."" The seasoned legal eagle McConaughey plays in ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" is much different from the inexperienced and idealistic one he played in ""A Time To Kill"" though. ""Micks not naive by any means"" observes the actor. ""Hes pretty much a pragmatist and understands how the system works. He has rules but he bends those rules and knows how to play both sides of the law."" VideoThe Lincoln Lawyer McConaughey who has appeared mostly in comedies and action adventures in recent years says it was fun to get back to drama and portray a somewhat flawed but ultimately good-hearted character. The actor spent some time talking to defense attorneys specifically L.A. defense attorneys to get a handle on his role.

It has nothing to do with the capital of Nebraska or the former president. While youre watching it though youll wish it did. Director Brad Furmans film which John Romano wrote based on the Michael Connelly novel has the slick disposable feel of the sort of legal drama you could find any night of the week on primetime TV. From the opening titles and underdeveloped characters to the quick pacing and flat lighting ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" seems insubstantial recycled and forgettable. Now this may sound vaguely familiar to you. If so please bear with us. McConaughey plays Mick Haller a cocky sleazy defense attorney who thinks hes got it all figured out. He woos the women -- including his prosecutor ex-wife and the mother of his daughter played by Marisa Tomei -- banters comfortably with biker gangs and generally weasels his way out of every tricky situation. The swagger was far more charming when McConaughey played a lawyer 15 years ago in ""A Time to Kill"" which is still the best adaptation of a John Grisham novel. The main difference between this role and most others he has played since then is he manages to keep his shirt on for the most part. But because this is a McConaughey movie his character will have his comeuppance and it comes in the form of a high-profile case. Beverly Hills real estate heir Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe) is accused in the rape and attempted murder of a prostitute. His expensively dressed mother (Frances Fisher) feels comfortable that Mick is the right man to defend her son and not her companys esteemed longtime legal counsel. Besides Louis insists hes innocent so it should be no problem. But this pretty boy is naturally more dangerous than he looks. Despite the many twists and turns and double-crosses Mick actually ends up learning nothing and has no arc -- hes just as unctuous at the end as he was in the beginning. The only time he appears to lose control is when he gets hammered at the local watering hole where everyone else gathers to get hammered -- and those moments seem so incongruent with who he is they make no sense. Among the strong but woefully underused supporting cast are William H. Macy as Micks best friend a private investigator; Bryan Cranston as a homicide detective whose screen time looks suspiciously truncated; and Michael Pena as a former client of Micks whose case will become crucial later on. McConaughey and Phillippe have a decent back-and-forth in a couple of scenes -- at least until Phillippe turns into a villainous cartoon character. ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" a Lionsgate release is rated R for some violence sexual content and language. Running time 119 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.

(Photo credit Saeed Adyani) Joe Neumaier Friday March 18 2011 400 AM Title With Matthew McConaughey Marisa Tomei Ryan Phillippe. An L.A. attorney works from his car and takes on a high-profile case. Director Brad Furman (159). R Violence sexual content language. At area theaters.Theres a reason potboiler paperbacks dont make good movies -- theres too much outlandish plot even for Hollywood.Yes John Grisham translates but judging from ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" adapted from a best-selling series by Michael Connelly similar writers like Jonathan Kellerman and David Baldacci better keep their focus on the page and not the screen.Matthew McConaughey is Michael (Mick) Haller an almost-sleazy Los Angeles attorney who cruises the streets in his mobile office -- a Lincoln Town Car -- and uses his honey-dripped Southern twang to (supposedly) charm all factions of the legal system.Haller has a sexy ex-wife (Marisa Tomei) in the DAs office but hes most adept at working the lower levels of the courts. His tit-for-tat friendship with a bail bondsman (John Leguizamo) brings him his latest case A rich Beverly Hills slimeball (Ryan Phillippe) on trial for assault and battery.But after signing on to defend the accused Mick and his shaggy investigator Frank (William H. Macy doing his best to be interesting) find out some things. The victim is a prostitute the slimeball has a link to an earlier case and someones broken into Micks house and stolen his antique gun.Eventually it all shakes down thanks to Micks connections -- hes like Jim Rockford only with abs. In the last decade the best outlets for McConaugheys know-it-all suavity have been high-camp larks like ""Fools Gold"" and ""Sahara.""Here hes a bad-boy litigator but thats all Mick is about. When he and Tomei flirt or have a conversation about their relationship they share a line or two that sounds like English before they have to lapse back into the wanna-be-sassy legalese so familiar from the forensics and criminology lingo of TV shows.Director Brad Furman presides over this failure. He opts for flashbacks showing the way the big crime could have happened as in a 1970s Agatha Christie-based mystery and the movie deflates into one ridiculous scene after another.And why exactly does Mick only work out of a car and not an office? Hey ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" might be accused of many things but not that its missing a gimmick.

Saeed Adyani/Lionsgate hide caption toggle caption Saeed Adyani/Lionsgate The Lincoln Lawyer Director Brad Furman Genre Crime Thriller Running Time 119 minutes Rated R for some violence sexual content and language With Matthew McConaughey Ryan Phillippe Marisa Tomei William H. Macy Watch Clips The Payment The Payment Credit Lionsgate Another Guy Another Guy Credit Liongate Dangerous Place Dangerous Place Credit Lionsgate Just when you thought Matthew McConaughey had settled into pre-retirement content to play the (dry-aged) beefcake in a string of dippy romantic comedies the actor comes roaring back with some real acting. In the engaging thriller The Lincoln Lawyer McConaughey gives a debonair Clooney of a performance as Mick Haller a smooth shyster of a Los Angeles criminal defense attorney -- a man who it will astonish you to learn grows ever nobler as the deepening mysteries of an apparently clear-cut case oblige him to redeem the wrongly accused and redress the wrongly excused. Thematically the film directed with intermittent flair by Brad Furman (The Take) from a literate screenplay by John Romano adds up to little more than a lengthy plot noodle complicated by gleefully layered flashbacks and powered by the usual Robin Hoodish sword-waving. Its based on a novel by Michael Connelly who has a former crime reporters eye for the informal mechanics by which a justice system subverts its best ideals. A willing bottom-feeder with the usual B-movie accoutrements Mick works out of an ancient Lincoln Continental whose registration plate NTGUILTY may be read as either heavy irony or a mission statement. His ""associates"" are a loyal driver (Laurence Mason emitting the statutory dry asides) and a rumpled private eye played by William H. Macy a reliably terrific actor even when hes got up like a claymated chipmunk in shoulder-length hair and cratered cheeks. McConaugheys Mick has spent his life negotiating plea bargains whose unintended effect all too often has been to put the innocent in jail and the guilty back out on the streets. But the humanitarian twinkle in his eye implies white-knight potential even when to raise necessary cash he takes the case of a pampered playboy (one Louis Roulet played by Ryan Phillippe) who claims to have been framed for the brutal murder of a call girl. The setups multiply bouncing between apparent victims and putative aggressors like a deadly game of ping-pong until Mick and his family become targets themselves. Repeatedly underlining its populist credentials the movie wheels in a soignee but ice-cold Frances Fisher as Louis patrician control-freak of a mother a real-estate mogul who believes that money can be usefully thrown at any problem. In its last leg drunk on plot twists and tangled in flaccid courtroom drama thats only briefly enlivened by a very funny Shea Whigham as a clueless witness for the prosecution The Lincoln Lawyer putters to a halt just when it should be steaming to a climax. i As danger dogs his heels Mick turns for help (and comfort) to his ex-wife Maggie (Marisa Tomei). Saeed Adyani/Lionsgate hide caption toggle caption Saeed Adyani/Lionsgate As danger dogs his heels Mick turns for help (and comfort) to his ex-wife Maggie (Marisa Tomei). Saeed Adyani/Lionsgate But if The Lincoln Lawyer has nothing new of substance to offer in its tale of life on the judicial margins it has relaxed L.A. atmosphere to burn. Furman paints an unaffected downright loving portrait of the city without recourse to cutaways of palm trees Muscle Beach or the palaces of Mulholland Drive. The seaminess backed by a low-key soundtrack never seems overdone; as shot by cinematographer Lukas Ettlin downtown Los Angeles is just what it is -- a vitally unplanned muddle of skyscrapers ugly-functional courtrooms stuffy bars and sleek corporate suites. And The Lincoln Lawyer is stuffed with good ensemble acting with McConaughey firmly in charge at its center. Like many directors Furman loves to shoot the actors carved profile. McConaughey remains the virile hunk yet theres a touching vulnerability -- and a taste of meaty roles to come -- in the slight sag of his jutting chin and the slow rise of his receding hairline. None of which detracts from the jaunty joie de vivre of Mick a man altered by experience but still more juiced by cutting deals with Hells Angels than by the prospect of career mobility. You can see why this beguiling fellows wife -- a scandalously underused Marisa Tomei as the long-suffering prosecutor from whom Mick is of course divorced (with banter) -- is still willing to help out on the occasional case. And to disrobe for him if only now and then.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Matthew McConaugheys mojo is working quite nicely in ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" a thriller in which innocence and being found ""not guilty"" are not the same thing. All twang and confidence Mr. Just Keep Livin hits the very notes that made him so durn winning in his indie debut ""Dazed and Confused"" and his big-screen breakthrough ""A Time to Kill."" As Los Angeles defense attorney Mick Haller McConaughey delivers a mix of ethical confusion moral concern and cocky physical ease. The slickster lawyer is the invention of best-selling novelist Michael Connelly. (The movie is directed by Brad Furman with a screenplay by John Romano.) Years ago at a Dodgers game Connelly struck up a conversation with a lawyer who said his office was his car. A character was born. Dont be fooled by the title. This is not a Civil War saga. For that you must wait until next month for Robert Redfords ""The Conspirator."" Instead the Lincoln referred to is the black boxy Lincoln Continental that Mick works from. Maybe its the stars drawl. Or that beautiful beast of a Detroit machine. Or perhaps its the Ramp;B meets hip-hop tunes and Micks cool-cat driver Earl (Laurence Mason). Whatever the combo the movie moves with a better-than- blue-eyed soulfulness. Micks clients tend toward lowly and rough. A biker gang pays him a visit on an L.A. roadway one hazy afternoon. His vanity plate reads ""NT GUILTY"" He plies the angles. But Micks canny gaming gets a workout once a bail bondsman friend (John Leguizamo) sends a deep-pockets client his way. Accused of the brutal assault of a young woman Louis Roulet is the baby-faced scion of real estate maven Mary Windsor (Frances Fisher). Ryan Phillippe does a convincing job making Roulet ambiguous. Does his lip tremble and his voice waver as he declares his innocence because he didnt do it -- or because hes certain he can snow everyone? Is he entitled? Or is he evil? The cast is ace. William H. Macy brings seen-it-all likability to Frank Levin Micks gumshoe. Michael Pena is touching as an accused man who crumbles in agony when Mick tells him to cut a deal. Marisa Tomei serves as anchor and foil as Maggie Micks ex and mother of their child. Shes also a prosecutor. The script hints but never sledgehammers the notion that this professional divide might have led to their differences which thanks to some nice chemistry hardly seem irreconcilable. While former client Jesus Martinez (Pena) waits out a life sentence in San Quentin doubt begins to nibble on the bud of Micks conscience. Is the agile lawyer being outmaneuvered? In a courtroom scene the cinematographers encircling camera work captures Mick in a whirlpool. The thrill comes in seeing how -- or if -- he can swim out of this dizzying mess. ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" is not a feat of genre-breaking design. But it is a well-oiled machine. And those who have known the pleasures of driving one of Detroits beautiful dinosaurs -- a Lincoln Town Car perhaps -- will recognize and appreciate the oh-so- smooth ride.

"The Lincoln Lawyer review Court Drama aims to bring audiences back to old genre |       NJ.com comments The Lincoln Lawyer review Court Drama aims to bring audiences back to old genre Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on March 18 2011 at 800 AM View/Post Comments Saeed Adyani Jesus Martinez (Michael PeA+-a left) and Mick Haller (Matthew McConaughey right) in ""The Lincoln Lawyer."" Whats more difficult for a lawyer -- knowing your client is a guilty dirtbag but youre going to get him off scot-free or knowing your client is an innocent loser and the best you can do is cut a deal? Michael Haller is about to find out. Haller is known as ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" around Los Angeles and its not because of any resemblance to Honest Abe. Its because he tools around town in a chauffeured Continental picking up -- and pleading out -- easy cases as quick as he finds them. But then things get complicated. And then they get dangerous. ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" is also the name of the movie in which all this takes place -- a movie thats meant to be a throwback to juicy justice thrillers like ""Jagged Edge."" (It even shares a producer with one of the last gems of the genre ""Primal Fear."") So we know a bit of what to expect -- an ambiguous client a colorful private investigator a prickly ex a not-so-ancient history of questionable dealings by the D.A. and a surprise witness. Movie Review The Lincoln Lawyer (R) Lionsgate (119 min.)Directed by Brad Furman. With Matthew McConaughey and Ryan Phillippe. Now playing in New Jersey. Rating note The film contains graphic violence sexual situations alcohol abuse and strong language. Stephen Whittys Review TWO AND A HALF STARS And yes as the film goes on all these exhibits are in evidence. Desperate genre fans might not mind. Although the tricks are familiar Hollywood ceded them to ""Law amp; Order"" and its progeny a long time ago; its kind of fun to have a big-screen courtroom drama again. It would be more fun if the hero were a little more colorful. All Matthew McConaugheys Haller has to his character is his cockiness and that gets a bit tiresome. Itd be better if he wasnt just fighting for his client but for himself. After all Paul Newman had to struggle to stay sober in ""The Verdict""; James Stewart had to go against a big-city lawyer in ""Anatomy of a Murder."" McConaughey eventually finds himself in an ethical quandary but the drama of it is never made really vital. Still McConaughey -- whos spent far too many years strolling bare-chested through romantic comedies -- gives this scoundrel a little spark. And Ryan Phillippe brings just the right spoiled sullen look to the client. Itd also be better if the film based on a Michael Connelly best-seller didnt crowd quite so many plot devices into its last half-hour. Or if its digital photography didnt tweak the colors so much either bleaching them out or giving everyone a Sunkist glow. But you know in the middle of March -- when the last Oscar films have finally left theaters and the big dumb summer movie season is heading up fast -- movie fans are sometimes willing to cut their own plea deal and settle for two hours of simple mostly guiltless escapism.

Having spent most of his career defending petty gutter-variety criminals Mick unexpectedly lands the case of a lifetime defending a rich Beverly Hills playboy who is accused of attempted murder. Starring Matthew McConaughey Marisa Tomei John Leguizamo Ryan Phillippe Michaela Conlin William H. Macy Margarita Levieva Katherine Moennig Michael Pare Michael Pena Director Brad Furman Running time 159 Release Opened Mar 18 2011  Editorial Review Bottom feeder lawyer takes the high roadBy Ann HornadayFriday March 18 2011Matthew McConaughey slides into his role with the insinuating ease of a bottleneck over a National guitar in ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" a pleasantly seedy crime thriller set in the most featureless nether regions of Los Angeles. McConaughey plays criminal defense attorney Mickey Haller a notorious bottom-feeder whose office is the back of a Lincoln Town Car and who counts his retainers by shaking the envelopes. Mickey is a scammer and a scoundrel and a striver in the finest cinematic tradition of Sidney Falco and Jerry Maguire.Adapted from Michael Connellys bestselling book ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" just may have the makings of a terrific franchise if only because it finds McConaughey so clearly in his comfort zone after a string of forgettable romantic comedies and action pictures. As Haller McConaughey makes the most of his Texas drawl slicked-back hair and ingratiating affability -- and for those keeping score at home yes he does take his shirt off but not until 45 minutes in and even then its too dark to see the actors famous six-pack.As ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" opens Haller agrees to represent rich kid Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe) who so earnestly insists that he didnt commit the savage beating of a girl that Haller almost believes him. With the help of investigator Frank Levin (a wonderfully shaggy William H. Macy) Haller begins to build his defense along the way discovering that the case is far more complicated than he first thought.Director Brad Furman gives ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" a down-market retro patina reminiscent of such washed-out classics as ""Harper"" and ""52 Pick-Up"" and more recently ""Out of Sight"" and ""Jackie Brown."" Granted he exhibits a weakness for hand-held shaky-cams to convey a jangly sense of spontaneity but for the most part he wisely lays off style for its own sake staying out of the way to let Connellys quirky vividly drawn characters carry the story. (""The Lincoln Lawyer"" was adapted by veteran crime screenwriter John Romano and his chops make all the difference; check out the graceful reveal of Marisa Tomeis character in an early scene.)""The Lincoln Lawyer"" threatens to bog down in increasingly preposterous plot twists and talky courtroom confrontations but Furman manages to keep the story simmering along with touches of ribald humor especially with the appearance of two hilarious witnesses played by Shea Whigham and Eric Etebari who as a nightclubbing playboy utters the deathless line ""We made pleasurable and consensual love. And then I paid her.""""The Lincoln Lawyer"" qualifies as a surprisingly enjoyable success largely because it doesnt overreach. With luck there will be more of McConaugheys Mickey Haller to come and with luck hell always be treated with this much casual unpretentious affection.Contains some violence sexual content and profanity.

Photo Fox Searchlight Calling big-screen legal thriller ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" the best TV pilot Ive seen in a while really isnt meant as a putdown -- the truth is theres more good stuff on the tube these days than in theaters especially at this time of the year. Matthew McConaughey keeps his shirt on and shows he can actually act when he feels like it as Mick Haller a smooth- talking scruples-free criminal lawyer who makes a handsome living defending the scum of Los Angeles out of the back of his limousine. One day a bail bondsman (John Leguizamo) gives Mick a referral to a more upscale client Louis (Ryan Phillippe) a Beverly Hills trust funder accused of trying to kill a prostitute. Mick is so overjoyed at this windfall that he briefly convinces himself that for once hes actually defending an innocent client. MORE RYAN PHILLIPPE TALKS WITH POPWRAP Not only is Louis as guilty as the rest but Mick quickly discovers hes probably responsible for a murder for which Mick persuaded an earlier client (Michael Pena) who was innocent to accept a lengthy prison sentence as part of a plea bargain. Given his lawyer-client relationship with Louis this presents our hero with an ethical conundrum that gets even more complicated when an associate turns up dead quite possibly at the clients hand leaving Mick as the prime suspect. Based on an airport page turner by Michael Connelly this is a slickly entertaining if not especially memorable movie filled with twists that director Brad Furman (""The Take"") and screenwriter John Romano (his rap sheets includes ""L.A. Law"" and ""Monk"" as well as ""Nights in Rodanthe"") sometimes telegraph well in advance. It goes down as smoothly as a milkshake thanks to an impressive cast William H. Macy as Micks private investigator Josh Lucas as the assistant district attorney unlucky enough to be prosecuting Louis and Bryan Cranston of ""Breaking Bad"" as a police detective itching to put Mick away for the associates murder. Second-billed Marisa Tomei has little to do but look sexy as Micks assistant-DA ex-wife while Frances Fisher may have a bit too much opportunity to chew scenery as Louis overprotective mom. A tad overlong at just under two hours ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" will be right at home on HBO. Lets hope the channel picks it up as a series; anything that keeps McConaughey from showing off his abs has my support.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 18 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 241PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English In Americas myth the pursuers of happiness always head west where their dream finds its dusty terminus in the sun-baked side streets of L.A. And that dust of course has become a favourite locale for genre fiction a good place to poke through the grime of lapsed ideals and rusted-out morality. There Raymond Chandlers private eye once saw many unseemly sights and now its the turn of Michael Connellys public defender. For the uninitiated Connelly is a pop wordsmith who writes the sort of page-flipping reads that often make for solid well-crafted and briskly paced Hollywood movies. Adapted from his book of the same title The Lincoln Lawyer is just such a movie - until it isnt. Movies The Lincoln Lawyer The official trailer Straight out of the gate the picture is every bit as slick and fast as its protagonist. His name is Mick Haller a defence attorney who works the bottom of the criminal barrel where the quality may be low but the quantity is unending. Although his clients are invariably guilty and woefully short of cash at least theyre in great supply filling jails across the counties. Thats why Mick keeps his office in the back seat of a Lincoln Continental the better to speed from courthouse to courthouse. Indeed under the crisp direction of Brad Furman speed is the operative word in the early frames as we follow our quick-witted lawyer (Matthew McConaughey) on his quotidian rounds - sweet-talking a bailiff to get a case advanced on the docket; deliberately delaying the trial of a biker until the rest of the gang ponies up his fee; or plea bargaining on behalf of a short-sighted hooker who accepted payment in crack cocaine only to get busted for possession. Just another day for him but for us the procedural details of this judicial demimonde are enlightening and amusing and best of all surveyed at a sprint. Efficient too is Furmans handling of the yarns opening twist. Mick is a happy angler when he lands a rare fish a defendant with big bucks. A fun-lover bankrolled by his rich mommy Roulet (Ryan Phillippe) is accused of engaging in some very rough play with a bar girl. He insists its all a setup devised by the girl and her pimp to slap him with a lucrative civil suit and the films succinct flashbacks seem to confirm his story. Having finally found an innocent man Mick gleefully takes the case assigns his veteran investigator to dig up the exculpating proof (a dishevelled William H. Macy looking as if he just migrated from the set of his TV series Shameless) and the plot is off and running as fast as ever. At this juncture even the cliched subplots are deftly treated. For instance as always in these gritty matters Mick is divorced from his spouse (Marisa Tomei) but in lieu of the customary flirtatious bickering we get a brief sequence that speaks emotional volumes The ex-husband carries their sleeping daughter presumably after a weekend visit back to the doorstep of the ex-wife who accepts the precious bundle and with a friendly smile steps back inside. That short nearly silent scene packs a volume of information. Also rebounding from a slew of iffy comedies and perhaps hoping to re-channel his legal mojo from A Time to Kill McConaughey does a highly credible job in the title role - not just with the slick Mick but more important with the transitional phase when like those private eyes of yore his character gets out of his depth and that seen-it-all aplomb regresses to dazed confusion. McConaugheys performance steps up precisely when Mick falls a step behind. Alas then comes the big trouble a drawn-out last act where the pace slows badly for the usual reason - the resolution gets ensnared in the very loose ends its obliged to tie up. Consequently what began as quick and engaging Hollywood craft at its most proficient ends as dull and predictable Hollywood product back in formulaic mode. Still fellow jurors lets remember The Lincoln Lawyer at its best and deliver a generous verdict - an innocent entertainment with extenuating circumstances.

"The Lincoln Lawyer The wrong arm of the law | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Lincoln Lawyer The wrong arm of the lawThe Lincoln Lawyer is a solid return to dramatic form for Matthew McConaughey who plays a seamy lawyer wrestling with the unexpected revival of his conscience.The spotlight is firmly on Matthew McConaughey in this taut legal thriller and he earns the attention.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. March 17 2011The Lincoln Lawyer (out of 4)Starring Matthew McConaughey Ryan Phillippe William H. Macy Josh Lucas Marisa Tomei and John Leguizamo. Directed by Brad Furman. 119 minutes. Opens Friday at major theatres. 14AThere are two immediate pleasures in seeing Matthew McConaughey essay such a seamy character as Mick Haller the bottom-feeding title attorney of The Lincoln Lawyer.This is McConaugheys first real dramatic role in five years following a string of comedies where it seemed he was content to ride his good looks and Texas charm until the horizon vanished. He has something to prove and he knows it.Article Continued BelowIts also intriguing to think of Haller as the curdled older version of the nervous defense attorney McConaughey played 15 years ago in A Time to Kill. He still wears the suit and talks the talk but idealism has been supplanted by cynicism.And The Lincoln Lawyer has attractions beyond the marquee. Director Brad Furman (The Take) and screenwriter John Romano (TVs Hill Street Blues and L.A. Law) take a sinewy yarn by crime novelist Michael Connelly and make a crackling good thriller of it.Its a bedrock legal tenet that even the devil deserves fair representation no matter how great the guilt or how aggrieved the victim. Conscience doesnt enter into it only duty.Yet some attorneys take an unseemly pride in defending the indefensible the state of mind where we first find McConaugheys Haller. He tools around L.A. in a chauffeured Lincoln which bears the license plate ""NTGUILTY.""The 1970s music on the soundtrack immediately tips to the pimp vibe. With his shades up and his ethics down Haller trades his considerable courtroom skills for fast cash no questions asked. If youve got the green hes got the smoke machine no matter whether his clients are bikers or bankers.Haller figures hes got a fast windfall when his bought-off bail bondsman (John Leguizamo) gives him a line on Beverly Hills playboy Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe) who is accused of beating and attempting to murder a woman he met in a bar.Roulet is like a spoiled rich brat but his alibi is sound and his mama has a big chequebook. Looks like another ka-ching for Haller but some sleuthing on his part aided by his shaggy sidekick Frank (William H. Macy a fine cameo) turns up disturbing evidence and possible corruption of justice.Hallers conscience long dormant starts to kick in. Yet pride and the law require him to give Roulet the best defence he can even if it means he must hold his nose while doing so.The Lincoln Lawyer has so much going for it you have to wonder why it has been padded with underwritten characters. Marisa Tomei has a criminally small role as Hallers ex-wife who is also a prosecuting attorney. Josh Lucas fares better as the main prosecutor facing down Haller but hes sidelined for much of the picture. The spotlight is firmly on McConaughey but he earns all the attention. The movie plays like the pilot for a potential TV series which is hardly surprising given screenwriter Romanos background.And it wouldnt necessarily be a bad idea if that happened. In the meantime its a solid return to dramatic form for Matthew McConaughey.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

(AP Photo/Lionsgate Saeed Adyani) Lincoln Lincoln Lawyer cant quite close the case BY JOE WILLIAMS  Post-Dispatch Film Critic  joewilliamspost-dispatch.com  314-340-8344 Mar 18 2011 (...) Saeed Adyani John Leguizamo (left) and Matthew McConaughey in ""The Lincoln Lawyer."" (AP Photo/Lionsgate Saeed Adyani) Hollywoods relationship with the justice system is dazed and confused. For every story about the enforcers ridding our streets of vermin theres another story about the defenders saving our innocents from the hangman.Yet in real life its a civil war with complications on both sides of a muddy Mason-Dixon line. In emancipating a principled attorney from a predatory client ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" strikes an uneasy compromise between liberty and justice. It marches at an efficient pace but theres too much collateral damage to believability.The flawed hero is Mick Haller (Matthew McConaughey) a drawling rascal who represents dubious clients and travels the back streets of Los Angeles in the titular luxury car (with a black chauffeur no less). When a shady bail bondsman (John Leguizamo) directs the lawyer to a young country-clubber named Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe) accused of pummeling a prostitute Mick smells money. Roulet insists hes being framed by a gold digger. When Roulets story is initially confirmed by a private investigator (William H. Macy) Mick delivers the mandatory monologue about the rights of the accused to the feisty prosecutor -- who just happens to be his ex-wife (Marisa Tomei in a throwaway role). But after she recuses herself and Mick goes to trial against an overmatched rookie (Josh Lucas) Roulet confides that (spoiler alert) hes guilty of numerous crimes. Because of attorney-client confidentiality rules the defense counsel cant squeal on Roulet and because Mick is so darn good at what he does hes likely to get the smug S.O.B. acquitted.With its ethical dilemmas courtroom reversals and two-dimensional characters who exist only to be killed or leveraged later ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" doesnt exactly have that new-movie smell. But because McConaughey is so darn good at what he does the result is a hung jury.

"Movie review The Lincoln Lawyer - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Michael ConnellyMovie review The Lincoln LawyerThe film version of Michael Connellys dark vision of the attorney-client conundrum is spun inside a plot thicker than star Matthew McConaugheys Texas drawl. At least L.A. looks stylish.March 18 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic ""Lincolns"" saving grace is the way Matthew McConaughey... (Saeed Adyani / Lionsgate )In ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" Matthew McConaugheys criminal defense attorney might seem like one cool customer but in truth he sweats everything a the big stuff the small stuff the clients the cases the ex and the kid. Perhaps this is less a function of the high drama in this tightly coiled legal conundrum than someone saying ""All right but if Matthews going to keep his shirt on lets at least keep him dripping wet."" Because as countless beach photos in Us magazine attest McConaughey does some of his best work wet. He was never better or sweatier than playing a hot Southern lawyer trying to win a racially charged murder trial in the 1996 big-screen adaptation of ""A Time to Kill."" Instead of John Grishams morally fraught attorney-client privilege dilemma this time weve got Michael Connellys even darker vision of that sacred trust spun inside a plot thicker than McConaugheys honey-dipped Texas drawl. Against all that heat everyone and everything else just melts which makes the film not the slam-dunk legal thriller it might have been. The biggest puddle turns out to be the client in the hot seat. Ryan Phillippes Louis Roulet is a young Beverly Hills real-estate slick in the mega-mansion business with a dirty little habit of paying for sex on the side. The question for the jury is whether or not he was the brutal beater or the intended mark of one Reggie Campo (Margarita Levieva). Shes a working girl pummeled in the heat of the night who might be looking at a big pay day if she can drag this into civil court with a criminal conviction in her favor. Now Phillippe can definitely pull off arrogant as he did to troubling effect in 1999s ""Cruel Intentions."" But hes far more comfortable playing the innocent his young Navy hero in ""Flags of Our Fathers"" chief among them. In ""Lincoln"" that inherent goodness seeps through to work against him. The notion that there might be a vicious sicko and not just a spoiled rich kid behind those blues eyes and blond curls just never takes hold. Without that tension the filmmakers rely on McConaugheys Mick Haller to emote concern anger regret outrage fear and revenge as he tools around Los Angeles in his Lincoln Town Car license plate ""NTGUILTY."" Hes got a ""Driving Miss Daisy""-style chauffeur named Earl (Laurence Mason) offering up observations on the deals Mick brokers in the back seat. And an ex named Maggie that Marisa Tomei serves up as a luscious adversary fighting the good fight of a prosecutor. But this is McConaugheys show and to that end he is framed in long shots tight shots even just one-eye shots with director of photography Lukas Ettlin working it from every angle. Unlike the cinematographers bumpy view of the city in the current ""Battle Los Angeles"" in ""Lincoln"" Ettlin gives both the movie and us a smooth stylish ride around town. This is director Brad Furmans first real shot at big-time filmmaking with a handful of shorts and one feature the little-seen 2007 righteous revenge flick ""The Take"" all thats in his pocket. What Furman did right in ""The Take"" was cast John Leguizamo in the lead and he uses the actor again here in a small but tasty morsel playing a sleazy bail bondsman. Another satisfying mini-bite comes from Michael PeA+-a (also in ""Battle Los Angeles"") making his few minutes as a one-time client count. While Furman shows a mostly steady hand with his actors the narrative flow trips things up considerably. Connellys book turns out to be too much for screenwriter John Romano to handle. Romano has worked across the TV spectrum and has a few film credits including co-writing the adaptation of Nicholas Sparks sappy romance ""Nights in Rodanthe."" But the intricate plotting that distinguished the book overwhelms the movie. Its a shame that no one seems to know what to keep and what to discard. Among the unfortunate William H. Macy as Micks private investigator and a key player in the mystery is dispensed with so fast that you wonder why they bothered. Meanwhile Josh Lucas greenhorn of a prosecutor fades as the tense courtroom sparring and most of the characters spine is missing. ""Lincolns"" saving grace is the way McConaughey manages to be magnetic against all odds. In Mick there is a maturity not seen in his other work a more nuanced performance as the actor exposes the uncertainty inside the smooth sarcasm the decency behind the grifters smile. If only we could have seen more of that even with his shirt on. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESThe Best Books of 2001December 2 2001Our Night on the Town With FredDecember 13 2000MORE STORIES ABOUTMichael ConnellyConundrumCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-lincoln-lawyer-20110318,0,5453408.story",200,thelincolnlawyer15,thelincolnlawyer,latimes

But he is in the general neighborhood. By Saeed Adyani Lionsgate Matthew McConaughey stars as Mick Haller an attorney who gets more than he bargained for with his latest case. EnlargeClose By Saeed Adyani Lionsgate Matthew McConaughey stars as Mick Haller an attorney who gets more than he bargained for with his latest case. More shifty than ghoulish hes the kind of guy who pays off bail bondsmen and calls it client development. A street-smart charmer Mick is as comfortable in Los Angeless seediest corners as he is before a jury. And Mick as embodied by Matthew McConaughey is a near-perfect match of material and actor. Since McConaughey has spent much of his recent career languishing in silly rom-coms its easy to forget that he lit up a courtroom in 1996s A Time to Kill. That swagger that rakish smile and that offhand drawl convincingly power McConaugheys portrayal of this slick legal hustler. Though he cuts a dashing figure in court he does manage to appear shirtless in one scene revealing those killer abs featured so prominently in glossy entertainment magazines. An ab flash or two is probably in his contract but its much easier to take him seriously with his clothes on. Mick is a cocky huckster but with an underlying moral compass -- though it mostly points in the direction of his favorite bar. His conscience comes into play when he takes the case of petulant Beverly Hills playboy Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe). Mick is accustomed to reprehensible types but they usually dont have the deep designer pockets of Louis and his creepy socialite mom (Frances Fisher). About the movie The Lincoln Lawyer   (out of four)Stars Matthew McConaughey Marisa Tomei Ryan Phillippe Michael Pena William H. Macy Josh Lucas Frances Fisher John LeguizamoDirector Brad FurmanDistributor LionsgateRating R for some violence sexual content and languageRunning time 1 hour 59 minutesOpens Friday nationwide Louis is charged with the brutal beating of a woman he met in a bar. Louis maintains his innocence claiming she was a prostitute out to fleece him. At first the case looks straightforward enough but it grows more intricate and far more dangerous. Can Mick be outmaneuvered? This screen adaptation of Michael Connellys clever legal thriller is stylish suspenseful and thoroughly entertaining. While adhering to the genres conventions its shrewdly plotted and briskly paced with hints of Raymond Chandler. McConaughey is bolstered by a top-flight ensemble of co-stars. Marisa Tomei plays Micks easygoing ex-wife a prosecutor with whom sparks persist. William H. Macy is his sardonic investigator Josh Lucas plays his prosecutorial nemesis Bryan Cranston is the hard-nosed detective he bumps up against and Michael Pena is a bitter convict whom Mick represented unsuccessfully. Director Brad Furmans swirling camera and John Romanos sharp script -- with dialogue lifted directly from Connellys novel -- combine to bring to vibrant life an L.A.-based story with more turns and curves than a Hollywood canyon.

Comments click to enlarge The Lincoln Lawyer Video Rated R  119 minutes  2011 Matthew McConaughey stars as a slick heavily booked criminal defense attorney in LA who operates out of the back of a chauffeur-driven Lincoln Continental. Most of his clients are probably guilty and that includes the arrogant Beverly Hills playboy (Ryan Phillippe) whos been accused of sexual assault--and who may have committed an earlier crime for which a previous client (Michael Pena) went to jail. This pungent neo-noir can be sleazy and over-familiar but like the protagonist its so smart and crafty that you may forgive its flaws. McConaughey whos been languishing in mediocre romantic comedies has a lot of fun with his part and hes surrounded by an excellent cast Marisa Tomei as his ex-wife William H.

Micks luck seemingly changes when he is asked to represent young millionaire Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe) who is accused of savagely beating and attempting to rape a young woman.Of course since this is a hard-boiled thriller disguised as a courtroom drama there is more to the case than meets the eye. The DA wont drop it even in light of compelling evidence indicating Roulets innocence. As Haller and his investigator (William H. Macy) dig deeper some startling details emerge and they hit a little too close to home for Haller.McConaugheys unfortunate choice of roles (and lets face it his offbeat off-screen behavior) have saddled him with a reputation as a vapid star with a penchant for unchallenging roles a persona he seemed to invite the moment he espoused the virtues of high-school girls in Dazed and Confused nearly 20 years ago.Here hes mastered that aura of terminally laid-back self-aggrandizing frat-boy cool and put it to good use. He deftly plays Haller as a cocky and charmingly sleazy man who knows hes good at what he does even though what he does often involves keeping criminals on the street.When his world starts to unravel his self-doubt becomes palpable and gripping. When he retakes control in the courtroom to maneuver his way out of a predicament thinking several moves ahead like a chess grandmaster its hard not to admire him just a little.Equal credit goes to the supporting cast an ensemble of character actors and talented leads that includes the aforementioned Phillippe and Macy as well as Marisa Tomei as Hallers ex Frances Fisher as Roulets lioness mother Bryan Cranston and Michael Pare as prickly cops and John Leguizamo as a shifty bail bondsman.Furman finds the right tone and pace though it does crawl a bit early on while the details are being established and screenwriter John Romano does an excellent job of streamlining the story. The result is a pulpy throwback to down-and-dirty 80s and 90s legal thrillers such as Jagged Edge Suspect and Presumed Innocent delivering the required twists and turns without sinking into tedium.The Lincoln LawyerB Starring Matthew McConaughey Marisa Tomei Ryan Phillippe William H.

Please please please dont watch the trailer. Click off the TV. Avoid it online. Dont watch it in theaters. If it pops up on the big screen shut your eyes and cover your ears and sing the theme to Star Wars (dum DUM dum-dum-dum DUM DUM). The reason for this media blackout is a long-festering problem Im calling Too Much Trailer now reaching crisis proportions. The ad for The Lincoln Lawyer blows the first of two giant corking plot twists -- an asinine decision that makes me wonder not for the first time whether the big brains behind these previews actually bother to watch the movies first. If they had they would have kept a tight lid on the plot because the plot is half the fun. More than half. Lincoln is smart juicy entertainment but its the kind of straight-up legal drama that hinges entirely on crafty storytelling and across-the-board solid performances. Directed by Brad Furman (The Take) from John Romanos adaptation of the Michael Connelly novel the film stars Matthew McConaughey as a sleek and smarmy defense lawyer who represents a playboy client accused of assault. The client is played by Ryan Phillippe doing a pretty fair take on sleek and smarmy himself. McConaughey nails it as attorney Mickey Haller. Hes a little more clothed than usual a little more landlocked but hes once again the sort of gleaming and disreputable bum that he plays best. ""How does someone like you sleep at night - with all the scum you represent?"" asks a disgruntled observer and the question skims right over his high-gloss exterior. Theres a languid and cocksure ease to McConaugheys performance that harks back to his first go as a lawyer in the John Grisham thriller A Time to Kill. (His second was Amistad for which he wore Ben Franklin spectacles and an appalling chinstrap beard.) In The Lincoln Lawyer hes supported on all sides by William H. Macy still sporting his Shameless hair as a crack investigator; by Marisa Tomei as a prosecutor and sympathetic (ahem) ex-wife; by Laurence Mason as Earl Mickeys driver who doles out assistance and insight from the wheel of a shining Lincoln Town Car. Yes Earl is the wise black chauffeur a stock figure in movies here available for a few moments of chill urban pragmatism whenever the white protagonist needs a re-charge. And yet the film manages this cliche (and a few others) with a quick wit and a deft hand never pausing long enough to try our patience. The plot moves. Keep in mind though - its a mystery and a courtroom drama not an action flick. Expect more jawing than jostling around the streets of Los Angeles. Furman exploits just enough shaky-cam to keep us on edge just enough framed shots to ground us and settle our stomachs. Theres just enough humor; just enough sex; just enough classic soul crooning through the credits. And there are just enough surprises to keep us watching. But dont blow a big one by watching the trailer. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals PUMA Mens Tazon 6 Ripstop Sneakers for 40 + free shipping Best Buy Clearance amp; Open-Box items Up to 50% off + free...

When the drawling Texan leaves that pigeonhole he soars.As the bottom-feeder attorney in The Lincoln Lawyer a twisty cleverly plotted thriller based on the crime novel by Michael Connelly McConaughey acts with his head and body. His legal eagle is a predator all right but one who retracts the talons in favor of mind games.Brad Furmans movie is shamelessly entertaining and the best thing in it is McConaugheys Mickey Haller known as ""the Lincoln lawyer"" because his office is his Town Car. Why pay for overhead when you have an ex-wife (Marisa Tomei as a world-weary assistant district attorney) and kid to help support?Micks a streetwise operator who knows how to make money off the front end and back end of every deal. He knows how to work the system without gaming it and how to make a bribe look like a legitimate Christmas gift. For him the end product of the justice system is not a fair verdict but getting a judgment and pocketing the payment for services.He strikes gold when his chum the bail bondsman (John Leguizamo) hooks him up with a franchise client Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe) a Beverly Hills real estate prince and playboy charged with assault and battery of a female escort. Almost unprecedented in Mickeys experience Roulet (rhymes with rouA(c)) may even be innocent.The part of the smoothy at the pickup game suits McConaughey down to the ground. Typically Mickey is several steps ahead of the D.A. In defending Roulet though what initially looks to be a slam-dunk is a desperation heave.In this nicely cast film featuring Bryan Cranston as a comically exasperated police detective William H. Macy is a standout as a private investigator a shaggy motormouth with access to all sorts of privileged information.Furmans movie has the throwback vibe of Paul Newman crime procedurals like The Drowning Pool and the swagger of the first installment in a continuing movie or television franchise. I for one look forward to the next chapter in the misadventures of Mickey.Contact film critic Carrie Rickey at crickeyphillynews.com or 215-854-5402.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" plays like the pilot for a TV series that would die after three weeks. The script is legal boilerplate bolted to mundane characters the acting is baked-ham buffet and the direction is basic cable mediocrity incarnate. Its the most unrewarding two hours you could spend in a theater short of a total power outage. This legal melodrama stars Matthew McConaughey as L.A. defense attorney Mickey Haller. Although his characters clientele is made up of bikers and underclass murder defendants McConaugheys performance is a nonstop smug swagger. An actor of more depth might suggest that a struggling double-dealing lawyer who affects a top-of-the-world attitude is putting on a brave front. The smirking McConaughey merely seems as self-infatuated as usual. No matter what role he plays his spirit animal is a peacock. Mickey whose cliched cynical exterior disguises an even more cliched idealism lucks onto a lucrative case that will test both aspects of his character. A handsome real estate heir (Ryan Phillippe) accused of brutalizing a prostitute wants Mickey to defend him. The goalposts of success shift several times as dark deeds come to light and Mickey tries to a) set his client free b) serve the greater demands of justice and c) hold onto his practice and his life as threats to both arise. Michael Connellys novel unread by me reportedly uses first-person narration to reveal Mickeys struggles with ethical quandaries and personal demons. The film drops this device and any shades of gray surrounding the character. This is a star vehicle expressly designed to make its leading man look wonderful. As Mickeys ex-wife Marisa Tomei regards McConaughey with rapt adoration. He may be the only lawyer in film history who actually makes it to his daughters soccer practice during a murder trial. Not a game mind you a practice. No wonder Tomei urges him back into her bed with a honeymooners eagerness. Youve gotta love this guy. No really you have to. We insist. Several normally reliable actors swim helplessly against the tide of Brad Furmans heavyhanded direction. Theres not much that even William H. Macy can do as Mickeys wisecracking private investigator whose defining characteristic is a haystack of surfer hair. John Leguizamos cameo as a corrupt bail bondsman does little to revive his flagging film career. Bryan Cranston might have given his stock role as an antagonistic police detective a squirt of real bile but hes in and out of the film as if passing through a revolving door. With luck ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" will be here and gone just as quickly. THE LINCOLN LAWYER  OUT OF FOUR STARS  RATING R FOR SOME VIOLENCE SEXUAL CONTENT AND LANGUAGE .

Share Tweet Its easy to forget that before he became synonymous with shirtlessness six-pack abs groovalicious good times partying with his bros and keeping it mellow Matthew McConaughey was heralded in some corners as the Paul Newman of his time a strikingly handsome actor with serious dramatic chops. McConaughey returns to the slick lawyer roles he played in the pre-walking-punchline stage of his career with The Lincoln Lawyer a new legal thriller based on a Michael Connelly novel in the time- and airport-tested tradition of John Grisham. McConaughey plays a fixture of the genre the glib seemingly amoral smoothie who develops a conscience while discovering much to his surprise that there may be more important things than money. Leaning hard on his good-ol-boy charm and devastating good looks McConaughey stars as an enormously successful lawyer adept at playing all the angles. He specializes in getting drug dealers murderers and other scum of the Earth exonerated so he doesnt think too much of it when hes asked to represent Ryan Phillippe a wealthy WASP accused of viciously beating a woman. But the case nevertheless reawakens his dormant idealism. The Lincoln Lawyer gets off to a promisingly ambiguous start but it takes a turn for the shrill and melodramatic with the arrival of Michael Pare as a cop unafraid to shout his disapproval of McConaugheys questionable ethics. From that point on the film devolves into the cozily predictable world of TV legal dramas abandoning the moral uncertainty of its opening scenes for the benefit of a villain so comically over-the-top in his evil he might as well be theatrically twirling a mustache and tying a damsel in distress to train tracks. Phillippe has established himself as a credible dramatic actor in films like Igby Goes Down and Breach but he regresses here to the kind of sneering playboy roles he vacantly inhabited before he proved he could act. The Lincoln Lawyer represents a slightly different incongruously clothed vehicle for McConaughey but like so many of his recent romantic comedies its agreeably mediocre a cinematic paperback novel transformed into the kind of fare folks mindlessly consume on planes and forget about before touching down.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + The Lincoln Lawyer is better than you think but only because what youre thinking probably cant be printed in a family newspaper. Admit it when you hear the phrase ""a Matthew McConaughey movie your expectations slip into the basement yes? Yes. On that score this adaptation of a best-selling Michael Connelly crime thriller is an improvement. Its a poorly directed yet surprisingly watchable mystery that aches to stand with the gumshoe classics of the 1970s -- films like ""Night Moves and ""The Long Goodbye -- and it has the supporting cast and neo-soul soundtrack to get at least halfway there.The star takes the title role of Mick Haller a slick opportunistic Los Angeles defense attorney. Mick -- hes called Mickey in the books but maybe thats too mickey-mouse for McConaughey -- rides to court in a chauffeur-driven Lincoln an amusing high-rent/low-rent touch that advertises his ability to work both sides of the fence. He knows everybody who matters from bailiffs to white-shoe lawyers and who he doesnt know he can charm or scam. Its a part that seems designed for McConaughey the star who can barely get out of bed in the morning.Tipped off by a motormouthed bail bondsman (John Leguizamo) Mick takes on the case of Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe) a real estate heir accused of almost beating to death a prostitute (Margarita Levieva). The kid swears he was set up and maybe he was; but well learn a few things about Roulet before the movies over and they call for more balls in the air than Phillippe is able to juggle. In a role marked by guile and manipulation he seems like a stand-in for an actor yet to be named.Surrounding Haller and his client though are a roster of pulpy types played by actors who can juggle in their sleep. William H. Macy as Frank Micks sardonic private investigator and Marisa Tomei as the heros ex-wife a prosecutor who still likes her bad boy even if she cant stay married to him. Michael Pena as a jailbird who may actually be innocent and Frances Fisher as Roulets frosty mother. The lovely too-little-seen Pell James as Hallers assistant and Shea Whigham who gives the courtroom sequence some needed comedy as a sleazy little jailhouse snitch.Happily slumming they file in and out of this overplotted story hit their marks and move on. For better and for worse ""The Lincoln Lawyer is such a close approximation of an airport novel that you can practically run your fingers over the embossed cover. The movie has its pleasures (see above) and its definite liabilities the latter including Lukas Ettlins cinematography which overdoes the pointless hand-held wobble-cam and is dingy to boot. The stars patented 24-7 tan looks like rust here although that may be the shoddy projection typical of Bostons downtown multiplexes (in this case the Fenway).As for McConaughey hes called upon to experience grave ethical conflicts which means the poor boy has to act. Thats a problem Mr. Naked Bongo Man hasnt truly worked his thespic muscles since at least ""We Are Marshall (2006) and arguably as far back as ""A Time to Kill (1996). Yet if the characters emotional struggles seem out of his comfort zone Micks sleazy confidence is made bearable even likable by McConaugheys light coating of oil.It feels at times like the actor sat down and watched ""Harper (1966) the sleepy LA noir in which Paul Newman played detective Lew Harper a character based on Ross Macdonalds Lew Archer. McConaughey is doing Newman Extra Lite here and it works well enough to hold you for almost all of the films two-hour running time. Connelly of course is a prolific and much-loved crime fiction master whose Mickey Haller series (the fourth and latest comes out next month) offers the star a shot at a franchise. ""The Lincoln Lawyer is formulaic enough to suggest that franchise would be B level at best a TV series at worst. But its also just good enough to make you want to watch it anyway.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. To follow him go to www.twitter.com/tyburr. (c) Copyright 2011 Globe Newspaper Company.

"The Lincoln Lawyer (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Lincoln Lawyer (R) Legal thriller threads suit Matthew McConaughey Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald3/16/2011 Editor rating 3 Maybe putting on a shirt is good for Matthew McConaughey. In The Lincoln Lawyer he dons a suit and gives a solid performance as Michael ""Mickey"" Haller a Los Angeles defense attorney who spends his days flitting from scumbag to courthouse and courthouse to scumbag and back again. Such roaming all over the city -- in the back seat of his Lincoln which acts as his office -- is all in a days work for Mickey a grinning hustler who represents motorcycle gangs and prostitutes and doesnt worry too much about the prosecutors and cops who think hes a dirt bag for freeing the perps theyre trying to put away. Then a bail bondsman (John Leguizamo) hooks him up with a different sort of client one who claims hes innocent. Louis Roulet (Ryan Philippe) is not a career criminal. Hes spoiled and wealthy -- and in jail on charges of assaulting a young woman he followed home from a bar. He says he didnt touch her; she set him up in order to sue him. He refuses to accept a plea bargain and demands the right to take the stand to defend himself. Mickey is skeptical but wonders if the guy is that all-too-rare and dangerous creature his lawyer father had warned him about the truly innocent client. But cases are never that simple especially in stories dreamed up by bestselling suspense writer Michael Connelly and new revelations in the investigation paint the accused attacker and victim in quite a different light. Based on the first novel in his series about Haller The Lincoln Lawyer is a movie fans of the book should enjoy as much as the uninitiated. Screenwriter John Romano takes a few liberties in the crossover mostly pruning down the action to make it more manageable on screen but he keeps the essence of Connellys thriller without going so far astray as screenwriter Brian Helgeland did in Clint Eastwoods version of Connellys Blood Work. Most fans of the novel would probably tell you McConaughey isnt someone they had pictured in the lead role but he works out just fine his laid-back breezy charisma exactly what Mickey requires to do his job. Marisa Tomei turns up as his prosecutor ex-wife Maggie. They fall into bed on occasion but theres no mystery about why theyre not together They loved each other enough to have a kid and a life for awhile but their opposite-ends-of-the-courtroom antagonism never quite vanishes at home. There are a few loose ends plot-wise but the films worst enemy appears to be its trailers which give away far too much. Protect yourself from them and youll find The Lincoln Lawyer a breath of fresh air in this musty spring movie season. Cast Matthew McConaughey Ryan Philippe Marisa Tomei Josh Lucas William H. Macy John Leguizamo. Director Brad Furman. Screenwriter John Romano. Based on the novel by Michael Connelly. Producers Sidney Kimmel Gary Lucchesi Tom Rosenberg Scott Steindorff Richard S. Wright. A Lionsgate Films release. Running time 119 minutes. Some violence sexual content language. Opens Friday March 22 at area theaters.

"Lincoln Lawyer The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; lincoln-lawyer-the ) Lincoln Lawyer The (United States 2011) March 16 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli SPOILER ALERT This review reveals a key plot element. Although the movie discloses it within the first 40 minutes there are those who may not want to know about it. Anyone in that category is cautioned not to read past the second paragraph until after seeing the film. When making a movie from a popular 400-page mystery/thriller novel the success or failure of the film production often relies more upon the quality of the adaptation than any other single factor. Subplots have to be eliminated character relationships simplified nuances eviscerated and pacing quickened. Complex stories dont necessarily have to be ""dumbed down"" but they must be streamlined to keep audiences engaged. Previously only one of Michael Connellys books Blood Work has reached the screen and that was a disappointment (especially considering Clint Eastwoods involvement). This time significantly more care has been taken to retain the elements that make the novel a page-turner (including chunks of Connellys dialogue) while keeping the running length reasonable and not drowning the viewer in exposition. The Lincoln Lawyer is an enjoyable piece of pop entertainment - a motion picture thriller with the feel of the numerous John Grisham adaptations that followed one another in a pipeline from book to screen during the 1990s. In one of his best recent performances (possibly his most convincing since appearing opposite Al Pacino in Two for the Money) Matthew McConaughey plays hotshot lawyer Mick Haller who tools around town in a Lincoln Town Car and will defend anyone who can pay his fee. When hes called to go to bat for multi-millionaire Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe) who is accused of assault and attempted rape Mick thinks hes the luckiest lawyer in Southern California... until the ugly facts of the case start surfacing due to the diligent efforts of his investigator Frank Levin (William H. Macy). In fact the case is anything but cut-and-dry and despite compelling evidence pointing to Roulets innocence assistant D.A. Ted Minton (Josh Lucas) wont drop the charges. It doesnt take long for Mick to discover why. The Lincoln Lawyer starts as a fairly traditional whodunit mystery before morphing into a thriller that forces an attorney to balance the ethics of his profession against the greater good. We occasionally find movies in which priests told damning secrets in the confessional must test their conscience but its rare to see this dilemma play out in a legal setting. By the films one-third point we know that Roulet is guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt and not only of this crime but of a more heinous one in the past. Yet Micks hands are tied - he cant reveal the truth to anyone without violating attorney/client confidentiality. Furthermore he must do everything within his considerable ability to achieve a ""not guilty"" verdict for Roulet. Suddenly the lawyer who cared only about making money is confronted with the darkest imaginable reality not to mention personal jeopardy. The court scenes are fascinating not exclusively because they show a brilliant attorney treating the witnesses and jurors like pieces on a chessboard but also because this is a case Mick would dearly love to lose. As he struggles behind-the-scenes to find a way out of the trap Roulet has laid for him he continues to perform brilliantly on the judges stage. The ending is a little too convenient but in the best tradition of mystery thrillers of this sort it satisfies enough on an emotional level that were willing to forgive any intellectual procedural and logical shortcomings. One suspects a lawyer will be able to nitpick far more effectively than I could. For a layman the legal representations proclaim a level of verisimilitude that is not present in many productions of this ilk. With his off-screen antics and his predilection for choosing vapid and unchallenging roles Matthew McConaughey has established a blemished reputation; it takes a performance like this one to remind viewers that given the right role and the will to invest himself in it he can be convincing and compelling. Second billing goes to Marisa Tomei whos in the film primarily because she has a large role in the book but her character - Micks ex and the mother of his daughter - serves little purpose beyond rounding out his personality and providing someone to occasionally spar with. William H. Macy is as always delightful although his screen time is limited. And Ryan Phillippe is disturbingly good as a sociopath. The reason to see The Lincoln Lawyer is the reason to read the novel because its fast-paced and satisfying and packs in a few twists and turns without straining credulity beyond the breaking point. Director Brad Furman finds the right tone and pace to make the film succeed and John Romano snips and cuts the source material in a way that brings the best elements to the screen. After seeing the final cut Connelly purportedly provided his approval. Like the best of the John Grisham screen adaptations this one holds the viewers attention beginning to end and satisfies with the way things are resolved.

The Lincoln Lawyer Fair Director Brad Furman. Cast Matthew McConaughey Marisa Tomei Ryan Phillippe. Rating R for some violence sexual content and language. Guide to this weeks new movie releases Qamp;A McConaughey lawyers up in Lincoln >> Qamp;A McConaughey lawyers up In ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" McConaughey once again takes off his shirt but only for a minute. Im happy to report that he spends most of his time acting while clothed. The story based on the Michael Connelly novel grows increasingly far-fetched - at times it plays like an expensive pilot for a TV series maybe a ""Young Barnaby Jones"" or something. But McConaughey is obviously having a grand old time playing Mick Haller the wheeler-dealer lawyer who often finds inspiration in a bottle and relies more on street smarts than whatever he learned in law school. Whether hes outmaneuvering the police guilty clients or the system itself Haller relishes escaping from the corners hes painted himself into and its fun to watch McConaughey portray that particularly when it comes to showing higher-paid better-dressed attorneys what a little creative thinking can accomplish. Haller with the help of bail bondsman Val (John Leguizamo) lands a high-profile case - defending spoiled rich kid Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe) who is accused of rape and attempted murder. Roulet like most defendants claims he didnt do it. Frank Levin (William H. Macy) Hallers longtime investigator isnt so sure. Despite knowing the ins and outs of the legal system Haller lives a rather low-rent life. He lives in a glorified shotgun house and his office is the back of a car (note title) which is driven by his chauffer Earl (Laurence Mason). We learn that Haller once lost his license but not why; drinking is hinted at (and practiced). His clients include bikers with whom he conducts business on the side of the road. Its an odd bunch the legal set in this movie. Haller often runs into his ex-wife Maggie (Marisa Tomei) a prosecutor with whom he has a daughter. When you hear the phrase ""legal fraternity"" you dont necessarily think of a group of lawyers who go out for beers all the time after work but that seems to be how these folks operate. The more Haller learns about Roulet the less he likes his case and he begins to question an earlier case that resulted in his client Jesus Martinez (Michael Pena) being convicted of a murder its starting to look like he didnt commit. The task for director Brad Furman is to tie all of the loose ends up with some legal wizardry on the part of Haller. As you might expect he does but not particularly convincingly and a little extra melodrama is thrown in for no good reason as well. Still its encouraging to see McConaughey interact with other characters instead of just his abs. He is an entertaining actor or can be. He is here when the story doesnt get in the way.

Audiences are likely to have strong memories of the star as a perspiring Mississippi lawyer 15 years ago in the movie adaptation of John Grishams legal thriller A Time to Kill. Those customers will be pleased to know that the guy still looks great arguing in a courtroom still delivers his lines with a variable drawl implying barbecue for dinner. This time McConaughey is Mick Haller whos familiar to fans of Connellys best-selling detective novels as the half brother of the LAPDs Harry Bosch. Hallers an unorthodox smoothie His ""office"" is the backseat of his chauffeured Lincoln Continental and his clients tend to be colorful bottom-of-the-deck types that character actors love. The lawyers newest client though is fancier goods. Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe his petulant lip telegraphing his attitude) is the son of a rich family and hes been charged with attempted rape and murder. He swears innocence but he may or may not be guilty. And his case bumps up against that of another former Haller client already wrongly convicted. The whole thing gets Hallers moral gyroscope whirling in a way that makes for good reading but not automatically compelling moviegoing. Plot leaps that are fun on paper look generic on screen; heres another lawyer movie in which the characters are only as interesting as the actors playing them. At least director Brad Furman gives them their space. Among the draws William H. Macy (in Shameless hair) as Hallers investigator; Marisa Tomei as a DA whos also Hallers ex-wife; and Bryan Cranston (with more hair than on Breaking Bad) in a small swell role as a hard-ass homicide detective.

The title refers to Mick Haller (Matthew McConaughey) an L.A. ambulance chaser who conducts business from the back of a Town Car commandeered by his faithful driver Earl (Laurence Mason the only African-American in the cast--are we to believe there are no black law professionals in California?). Haller is handed a high-profile case defending a real estate mogul (Ryan Phillippe) accused of beating up a prostitute but while Richie Rich maintains his innocence things arent . . . well you know how these things go. Haller craftily finagles his way out of the deep shit hes stepped into during the best stretch of the movie but its largely undercut by uninspired direction car-commercial art direction and a lack of grit that makes the hidebound nature of the genre stand out like an episode of Matlock on HBO. At least McConaughey is game; he generally acts as if hes getting away with something nobody can prove anyway so playing a smooth-talking Southland shyster may be the role of his life.

Legal thriller ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" is a quintessential airport-novel kind of movie possessing no great qualities or ambitions. As such its easy enough to just soak up star Matthew McConaugheys good-ol-boy appeal and overlook the films stilted dialogue bizarre directorial indulgences excessive running time and boilerplate ""Law and Order""-style narrative though anyone hoping for more will be frustrated at every turn. A stellar cast and the popularity of source novelist Michael Connelly should drive decent business and the Lionsgate release ought to be a staple on weekend afternoon cable. Keeping his abs tastefully concealed for the first time in recent memory McConaughey struts through the picture as Los Angeles defense attorney Mick Haller a smooth talker and hard drinker who does business out of a vintage Lincoln Continental. We can assume hes good-hearted as hes played by Matthew McConaughey we know hes streetwise because his streetwise driver tells us so and the early scenes paint him as being so rakishly clever that one half expects Elmer Fudd to show up opposite him in court. Micks clientele seems harmless enough -- mostly comprised of bikers and good-humored call girls -- until a friendly bail bondsman (John Leguizamo) hooks him up with a defendant from a far higher tax bracket Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe) a Beverly Hills blueblood accused of badly beating a prostitute in an attempted rape and murder. Louis insists hes being set up by the girl yet maintains a perplexing insistence that the case go to trial as quickly as possible. As expected things are not what they seem and Micks investigator (William H. Macy testing out some curious vocal inflections) unearths evidence that has repercussions for a closed case from Micks past. Gestures toward a romantic subplot arrive in the form of Micks prosecuting attorney ex-wife (Marisa Tomei) though shes given little to do except frequently drive our hero home from the bar. ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" betrays some of the classic signs of an overly faithful adaptation as several characters barely glimpsed in the film are referred to throughout as though the audience is intimately familiar with their peccadilloes and past histories. Its also the rare thriller that actually gets more expository as it goes on At first it assumes the audience is familiar with attorney-client privilege only to pause later on to explain it in detail and a late-breaking twist is revealed and then disregarded with almost comical offhandedness. Director Brad Furman (""The Take"") shoots the film with a borderline-hyperreal degree of stylization using an oversaturated color palette and tossing in ample whip pans and sudden swooping zooms. He demonstrates a perfectly competent hand with all of these techniques but its never clear why hes chosen to employ them and the shooting style is at times weirdly out of sync with whats happening in front of the camera. Pic at least deserves praise for its location scouting shooting in the gritty industrial corners of L.A. so infrequently glimpsed on film. Other technical work is of a uniformly professional caliber.

Daily Edition Login to download The Lincoln Lawyer Film Review 600 AM PST 3/9/2011 by Kirk Honeycutt FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS A moderately entertaining crime drama from people who know their way around a bloody knife or suspicious evidence. TWITTER Matthew McConaughey John Leguizamo Ryan Phillippe William H. Macy and Marisa Tomei star in the movie based on Michael Connellys first Mickey Haller novel. The hands behind The Lincoln Lawyer are all old ones when it comes to crime. Screenwriter John Romano served time as writer-producer on Hills Street Blues L.A. Law and Monk while director Brad Furman turned to crime in his first feature The Take. Meanwhile the film is based on the first Mickey Haller novel by ace crime novelist Michael Connelly who literally reinvented the L.A. noir novel with his realistic procedural series starring iconoclastic police detective Harry Bosch and now his Lincoln Lawyer series featuring attorney-at-law Michael ""Mick"" Haller. So no great surprise here that The Lincoln Lawyer turns out to be superior piece of crime storytelling with some characters clearly designed for recurring roles (in other novels and perhaps other films should this one do well) while others are designated for showy guest appearances as larger-than-life evildoers or tough-guy eccentrics. The film is only ""superior"" though not great. The themes feel shopworn and devotee of crime fiction can point to the any number of antecedents for these characters. All of which may add up to a couple of above-average weeks at the box office for Lionsgate and perhaps an even more handsome payoff in home entertainment. Viewers may sense this is the kind of bad-guys-vs.-even-worse-guys film they can check out any time on TV cable or Netflix. Its ambulance-chaser protagonist Haller (Matthew McConaughey returning to the profession that established his career with 1996s A Time to Kill) is anything but new only perhaps his MO is a bit unusual He conducts most of his business in the backseat of a chauffeured Lincoln Continental. (Surely you didnt suppose there was something Lincoln-esque about a Michael Connelly hero did you?) Its license plate reads NTGUILTY which is a condition he neverfinds any client mostly petty thieves hookers drug-dealing bikers and the occasional low-level killer he handles through his knowledgeable exploitation of the legal system. Then thanks to a paid-off bail bondsman (John Leguizamo) he lands a rich Beverly Hills playboy (Ryan Phillippe) accused of battery and attempted murder of a women. As always a client adamantly declares his innocence -- the whole thing he insists is a set-up to take a rich kid to the cleaners -- but for once Haller thinks it might be true. Instead of pleas bargains and deals he may actually have to defend his client in court. Unfortunately crime fiction has turned everyone into a cynic. So you are privileged to smell a rat the street-smart lawyer cant. Even Hallers faithful investigator (William H. Macy still in long tresses for his ShamelessShowtime series) picks up the odor. The story moves along at a swift clip introducing key characters who may play roles in upcoming episodes -- Hallers ex-wife and a prosecuting attorney no less for a little of that Adams Ribgive-and-take (Marisa Tomei brutally underused); his faithful chauffeur (Laurence Mason); and opposing attorney (Josh Lucas) -- plus minor seemingly inconsequential ones that suddenly play major tasks at the climax. The strong scent of deja vu hangs over everything -- a cop even asks how Haller can sleep at night given the scum he defends -- but nothing prevents the movie from its basic job of entertainment. OK far-fetched entertainment that you can pick apart at your leisure after the slightly out-of-left-field climax. (Its more like third base.) Every now and then an actor appears to delivers such rock-solid character work that you can only imagine what TheLincoln Lawyer might have been with less reliance on rote characters and situations. Such an actor is Michael Pena who plays a poor schnook Haller once defended only for him to wind up in San Quentin prison. As L.A. crime movies have used up the usual locations this one wanders into Echo Park Boyle Heights Inglewood and the like to pick up worn-out interestingly unconventional neighborhoods that are new to film. So call the film NTBAD. It accomplishes its job in a smooth cool manner with showy performances the economy of TV-style camera set-ups and a touch of rap on its soundtrack. In March you can do so much worse.
