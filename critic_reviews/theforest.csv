The ultra-modern house they share with their father (Callum Keith Rennie) is abuzz with music and energy ... until it isnt. Nell moans that she cant study without her technology and Evas miffed that she has to practice to a metronome for her dance audition. But these turn out to be the least of their worries.As the blackout stretches on for days the trio remains oblivious and hopeful. They ride into town to fetch supplies and cross paths with Stan (Michael Eklund) a confrontational and creepy supply-store manager with a shotgun who ogles the girls before handing over the last few candles gallons of gas and unmarked cans of food. Later as their Jeep pulls away from a celebratory bonfire and Nell stares after her boyfriend Eli (Max Minghella) theres a spirit of revelry. The girls sing a pop song a cappella that takes on a haunting tone while their father drives up to a stalled car. Somethings happening. Men are standing around. But the fathers greeted with a shotgun and suddenly that gas canister in the backseat seems like everything as they speed away.The next day the fathers swiftly removed from the story during a minimal but emotional scene. That clicking metronome meets the angry buzzing of a chainsaw and the panicked breathing of the two girls as their father says -- twice -- ""You have each other."" Rozemas only allowed the audience to live with this family for a thin 25 minutes but their pain is rendered so fully -- with quick artful shots of tensed eyebrows a bloody leg and clutching hands -- that its like she used the playbook for Psychos infamous shower murder (77 different-angled shots) and applied it to grief instead.Rozemas writing and directing style is fiercely spare. It seems she read Jean Heglands novel of the same name and selected precisely the right number of details from every chapter to evoke each emotion a glance at the gas gauge; a lingering lustful look; a shelf of untouched books; a wry comment from Nell about selling her sister. The story hums along with little time for the overwrought -- these sister survivors stranded in the woods have to learn how to pick berries chop wood render fat kill and dress wild hogs and care for one another. And throughout Page and Wood as Nell and Eva are realistically loving annoying and loyal to one another with every hug push and pull both sisterly and fraught with the weight of shared history.As a year without civilization passes Rozema frames her two leads more and more intimately their modern dwelling dwindling to a few black-molded rooms that havent crumbled in disrepair while they endure the worst the world could offer. But every moment the situation seems hopeless theres a flicker of light most often simply the reassurance that no matter what happens these two really do have each other. This isnt torture-porn dystopia; its a singular honest heartfelt portrait of sisterly devotion at the end of the world.

Kate Taylor Globe and Mail update - with correction Published Friday Jun. 03 2016 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Jun. 03 2016 127PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Into the Forest (3 stars) Written and directed by Patricia Rozema Starring Ellen Page and Evan Rachel WoodKoneline our land beautiful (4 stars) Written and directed by Nettie WildIn the new documentary Koneline our land beautiful a British Columbian guide who leads big-game hunters into the wilderness tells an anecdote about a client asking what survival gear she has in her pack. The question stumps her because she doesnt have any. So instead she replies ""I dont survive out here; I live out here."" But Patricia Rozemas apocalyptic drama Into the Forest is about nothing but survival Two young women poised on the brink of promising adult lives are thrust into a primordial struggle when a continental power outage leaves them stranded in their isolated home in the woods.Both films were shot in western B.C. and capture the danger and the promise of an inspiring natural world. Both feature a lot of action driven by women and depict people confronted with hard choices about how they are going to live. Both include a grisly scene where wild game is skinned and butchered.Of course the films are entirely different. Created by documentarian Nettie Wild and recognized as the best Canadian documentary feature at last months Hot Docs festival in Toronto Koneline is a subtle and remarkably even-handed evocation of what it means to live near the site of the Red Chris gold-and-copper mine among the sweeping landscapes of northwestern B.C. Into the Forest which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival last September is a sometimes claustrophobic drama about the relationship between two sisters caught in a fictional extreme.It was shot more than 1000 kilometres further south in forests around Campbell River on the east coast of Vancouver Island and on locations in the Lower Mainland.And yet the two Canadian films coincidental arrival in theatres in the same month - Into the Forest is being released commercially this week; Koneline will be at the Bloor Hot Docs Cinema in Toronto next week - seems serendipitous sounding thematic notes across the genres. Whats the optimum amount of technological modernity? Is life only about putting food on the table?Perhaps it is to a young father from the Tahltan First Nation who confesses that he now mines the land of his ancestors Quietly frankly he explains this is how he feeds his family. Wild does not judge that; indeed she reveals a certain heroism in the installation of the transmission towers that will bring power to the Red Chris mine. The battle to get one tower into place is just one of many spectacular images captured by cinematographer Van Royko whose camera swirls vertiginously over trees and mountains.Wild skillfully juxtaposes a soundtrack of gentle ruminations about nature culture and economics spoken by the Tahltan white hunters and mine workers against a meditative film of ceaseless activity geologists consider core samples line workers pull electrical cables elders blockade a road locals rescue stranded salmon hunters shoot a moose and the guide swims her team of horses across a swollen river.All these people have a stake in the land; and the mine opened by a company that suffered a bad spill from a tailings pond at another location poses a painful dilemma of economics versus environmentalism.Cleverly Wild symbolizes that with a traditional Tahltan game in which the dancing players seek to conceal from their opponents in which hand they hold a token. Which one do you choose?Nell (Ellen Page) and Eva (Evan Rachel Wood) are victims of increasingly desperate circumstances - Into the Forest is one of those movies where you are always wondering what will go wrong next - and yet they too emerge as women who are strong enough to make impossible choices. When the lights go out they are living comfortably with their loving and capable father in a modernist house in the fertile woods of the Pacific Northwest half a jerry can of gas away from the nearest town. Nell is studying for university entrance exams; Eva is dancing in her glass-enclosed studio hoping to win a spot at a ballet school.But the lights never come back on and their useful father (a sympathetic Callum Keith Rennie) is rapidly dispatched from the action by an accident on the property. This is one of the more ungainly and improbable scenes in the film but generally Rozema balances the symbolism of a doomsday scenario she has adapted from the popular 1996 novel by the American writer Jean Hegland and believable practical details about living without electricity or transportation as food supplies dwindle.In that balance she finds her richest material in the sibling relationship. Both Page and Wood hand in tough yet delicate performances as over the course of a year adversity shapes their characters. Page gently matures the girlish Nell creating a figure of increasing psychological strength while the more high-strung Eva who cannot cope without music to dance to falls into a despair that Wood makes desperately real.For these women men may offer support escape or marauding violence but in the end both through circumstances and by choice stand alone. In that increasingly competent solitude they make one last fateful decision as Rozema eschews all the standard tropes of the survivalist drama from the dizzy heroics to the final relief and rescue. It was only after I watched Koneline that I understood the surprising conclusion of Into the Forest It marks the moment the characters stop surviving and start living.Koneline our land beautiful opens June 10.Editors noteAn earlier version of this article stated that a film was shot in redwood forests around Campbell River. In fact there are no redwood forests in B.C.

Into the Forests postapocalyptic story will stay with you review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesInto the Forests postapocalyptic story will stay with you review Into the Forest starring Ellen Page and Evan Rachel Wood displays both intelligence and dramatic heft.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. June 2 2016Into the ForestStarring Ellen Page Evan Rachel Wood Max Minghella and Callum Keith Rennie. Written and directed by Patricia Rozema. 101 minutes. Opens Friday at the Varsity. 14ACanadian director Patricia Rozemas Into the Forest invites those of us (like me) who react as if its the end of the world when the internet goes down for a few hours or the fridge packs it in to imagine what zero electricity would do to our coddled lives.Based on Jean Heglands novel the near-future-set drama focuses on teen sisters (Ellen Page and Evan Rachel Wood both excellent) fending for themselves after a catastrophic continentwide power failure shrinks their world to an isolated house in the Pacific Northwest woods.Article Continued BelowNell (Page) is studying for university entrance exams while Eva (Wood) obsessively works on the modern dance piece she hopes will earn her a spot with a company. They share a Frank Lloyd Wright-style house with their cool-guy dad (Callum Keith Rennie) whom they tease about forcing them to live so far from town. They miss their mother who died a few years before.Evan Rachel Wood left and Ellen Page star in Into the Forest.They are happily on the grid reading on fancy see-through tablets and working on curved computer screens. When the power goes out its seen as a mere nuisance.The girls go on with their lives complaining about stale bread and powdered milk while checking the solar radio for updates. Nell is in the early going of a romance with Eli (Max Minghella) and balks when her father insists on conserving gas rather than taking her to town to meet him. Eva uses a metronome for dance class to fill in the music void. Meanwhile Rozema slowly adds tension that nibbles at the edges of the frame.A rare postapocalyptic story with both intelligence and dramatic heft the films coming-of-age framework sees Nell and Eva experiencing things typical of teen siblings bickering and deal-making devotion and caring while struggling with an existence that brings unanticipated dangers. They grow and change as the months pass surprising themselves with their skills. There will be more dramatic demands to come.Rozema (Mansfield Park Ive Heard the Mermaids Singing) has a sure directing hand here and this is among her best work including a scene of unthinkable violence shot in a dramatic tight fashion that will stand as a film-school lesson. Daniel Grants cinematography is sublime the lush forest and the house becoming distinct characters.The final scenes of this haunting movie wont sit well with everyone and are sure to spark passionate discussions after the lights come up -- an occurrence that may be greeted with a feeling of gratitude.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Based on the novel by Jean Hegland the film is set in the near future in the wilds of Northern California. One day life is normal; the next day in the face of some unknown global catastrophe everything begins to quietly deteriorate. Eva (Evan Rachel Wood) and Nell (Ellen Page) and their father (Callum Keith Rennie) live up in the mountains in a beautiful setting thats just far enough from town to guarantee privacy. Nell is studying for admissions exams while her older sister is focused on a contemporary dance audition. Their regular lives are interrupted one day by an annoying power outage. It happens. But this lasts longer than usual. Nell monitors the news on a transistor radio and learns that its widespread. This is the beginning of the end. To its everlasting credit Into the Forest doesnt dwell on the whys or wherefores of societal breakdown. There are no natural disasters shown no little green men no exploding warheads no trashed cities -- its just over. After a spell with no power the family goes to town to find ransacked grocery stores empty gas stations and people scared and uncertain about what to do next. Back at home in their fathers absence Eva and Nell are increasingly asked to rely on themselves. Initially they cling to the status quo but as things deteriorate they learn to adjust to their altered circumstances. They learn to rely on each other and they learn to fight for survival. Into the Forest is part psychological thriller part contemporary fable. Writer/director Patricia Rozema describes her film as a coming-of-age movie as the women must fast-forward into adult life to survive; in their rural setting they learn how to forage for food and pick up various basic skills but as with all post-apocalyptic tales they must also avoid predators -- other people. (The story is not without violence and there are disturbing scenes.) Overall however this is a small intimate beautifully shot examination of loss and renewal. The performances are everything; the focus is on Ellen Page and Evan Rachel Wood but Max Minghella Wendy Crewson and Michael Eklund also turn up briefly in the story. In the midst of blockbuster season any viewer hungry for character-driven drama will appreciate the subtlety intelligence and power of Into the Forest.

TWITTER Ellen Page and Evan Rachel Wood play sisters working to survive after the worlds lights go out. Two sisters keep each other alive while the world goes to hell in Into the Forest a survival picture by Patricia Rozema (Mansfield Park Ive Heard the Mermaids Singing) that for a while almost makes the end times look serene. Beautiful and sensitive to character but gripping when it needs to be the pic is too grounded to be lumped into the apocalyptic genre bin and stars Ellen Page and Evan Rachel Wood should ensure it attracts attention from moviegoers beyond that niche. Though set ""in the near future"" and offering quick glimpses of next-gen tech nothing in the film would be different thirty years ago and marketers would probably be wise to focus on two-handed drama over an irrelevant sci-fi label. The two play sisters Nell (Page) and Eva (Wood) who live with their dad (Callum Keith Rennie) in an unspecified Pacific Northwest forest. Though they have friends in a nearby town (including Max Minghellas Eli Nells new boyfriend) both embrace sylvan isolation at least for now -- Nell studies hard for a school entrance exam; Eva rehearses in a glass-enclosed dance studio in hopes of joining a professional troupe. Both those pastimes get more difficult when a massive power outage hits the nation knocking out Nells computer quieting Evas music and leading to gas and grocery shortages in town. Within a week or so its clear that the smart thing to do is stay home and wait for normalcy to return. But even at home things are precarious and the girls soon must get by without the help of their resourceful father. Adapting a novel by Jean Hegland Rozema checks in with her protagonists at intervals By two months in Eva has entered a depression; at six months they have established a fruitful foraging routine; strangely they dont seem to start hunting wildlife until theyve been stranded for more than a year. The actresses inhabit a wholly believable sibling dynamic with Eva needing more nurturing than her sister and only really drawing nourishment from her dance sessions -- beautiful episodes of abstract movement choreographed by Crystal Pite. Page watchful and worried carries responsibility on her shoulders without bitterness. The sisters quiet and sometimes dreamy isolation is interrupted on occasion by outsiders. Inevitably these encounters arent always welcome and Rozema maximizes the terrifying nature of one without exploiting her subjects trauma. When things begin to be unsustainable for the sisters -- when the physical demands of protecting themselves are overshadowed by psychic ones -- she presents them not as victims but as creators of their own path. Trusting each other without question they carry home wherever they must go in hopes that the world will someday return to the level of sanity they themselves have preserved.

At a time when apocalyptic scenarios tend to focus on societal collapse mass violence and the unleashing of zombie hordes its a small virtue that ""Into the Forest"" Patricia Rozemas heartfelt adaptation of Jean Heglands novel takes a decisive turn toward the intimate. When the power goes out for good at their secluded home in the Northern California woods two sisters are forced to fight for survival but the apocalypse only matters insofar as it intensifies and clarifies their bond. Ellen Page and Evan Rachel Wood are both superb in the lead roles but Rozemas emphasis on the primacy of family and nature exposes a deficit of visual and narrative imagination. Like the dwindling gas supply to the family generator Page and Wood can only energize this melodrama for so long before it sputters out and its commercial prospects will likewise flicker and fade. Living a few miles from civilization with a generous supply of organics and canned goods give Nell (Page) and Eva (Wood) the jump on disaster preparedness but ""Into the Forest"" spends the early going making clear that theyre just as gadget- and screen-dependent as other 21st-century Americans. Nell Eva and their widowed father (Callum Keith Rennie) have weathered a series of blackouts before but when the latest one appears permanent theyre forced to disconnect and improvise. The challenge becomes infinitely more difficult for the siblings after their father dies in a fluke accident and they have to figure out how to ration food protect themselves from invaders and hold onto their sanity. Rozema introduces a couple of other characters from town namely Nells boyfriend Eli (Max Minghella) who turns up with tempting proposition and Stan (Michael Eklund) a store clerk whose presence is considerably less welcome. But the focus is on Nell and Eva who love each other deeply yet sometimes struggle to figure out the best course of action. Before the outage Nell was studying for the SATs and Eva was working hard to prepare for a dance audition and they stubbornly cling to those activities even when its obvious theyll never come to pass. They still want to satisfy their wants as individuals even though they have to make sacrifices in order to survive as a unit. Though focusing on these activities keep them from falling into despair Rozema subtly connects their craving for normalcy with the modern condition of family members orbiting around each other. When technology exists to make every facet of life easier families run out of reasons to work on something together. By eliminating any specific cause to the blackout and keeping Nell and Eva mostly isolated from civilization ""Into the Forest"" can get back to the idea of people living as they did before Thomas Edison and Steve Jobs came along. Though a few shocking incidents take the film beyond mere survival drama Rozema bends toward a future where these women can step outside their door and figure out how to sustain themselves in an ancient forest. Amid their terrible hardships she finds a sliver of hope. Page (who developed and co-produced the project) and Wood are terrific together with all the symbiosis and friction expected of close siblings but Nells and Evas interior lives are regrettably thin. As with her 1999 Jane Austen adaptation ""Mansfield Park"" Rozema has an attraction to literary material but despite her evident intelligence and sensitivity she lacks the facility to bring it to specific cinematic life. Connecting the incidents in Heglands book gives ""Into the Forest"" plenty of dramatic kick but the film leaves the impression that the characters full selves remain stubbornly on the page as thoughts not translated into action. The absence of a more dynamic visual style harms the film too. Though Rozema enlists the celebrated Crystal Pite for Evas dance choreography she doesnt linger on its ecstatic poetry for very long. And with the natural majesty of British Columbia subbing more than capably for the redwoods of California its worse still that the forest doesnt assert itself more forcefully. As the title suggests there has to be a mythic pull to the landscape drawing the sisters away from the comfortable trappings of their former life. Its not enough to function as mere backdrop. Like the rest of the film it could use a bolder touch. Toronto Film Review Into the ForestReviewed at Toronto Film Festival (Special Presentations) Sept. 12 2015. Running time 101 MIN.
