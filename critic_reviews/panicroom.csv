Columbia Pictures By Joe Morgenstern Updated Oct. 1 2010 1201 a.m. ET In the course of a preface thats set in the mythic past--seven years ago when Facebook was only a gleam in Mark Zuckerbergs eye--a young woman tells Jesse Eisenbergs Mark that dating him is exhausting ""Its like dating a StairMaster."" Watching ""The Social Network"" is like getting a runners high without a treadmill or sweat. This account of Facebooks founder and of the websites explosive growth quickly lifts you to a state of exhilaration and pretty much keeps you there for two hours. Audio Social Network Has Friends Critic Joe Morgenstern gives the movie and cast glowing reviews. David Finchers film is devastating as biography--an unfriending of epic proportions--and dazzling as contemporary cultural history. The biographical part takes liberties with its subject. Aaron Sorkin based his supersmart and superbly funny screenplay on a contentious book Ben Mezrichs ""The Accidental Billionaires"" so everything thats seen isnt necessarily to be believed. (And it may be accidental that the subject chose the week before the movies release to announce his gift of 100 million to the schools of Newark N.J.) Yet Mr. Eisenbergs performance feels like revealed truth while youre watching it and given the pace of change that the story reflects his character will enter the culture as a consecrated archetype by tomorrow evening at the latest. Watch a clip from ""The Social Network"" a film about Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg. On screen the Harvard undergraduate who became the worlds youngest billionaire is the most anti of antiheroes since Travis Bickle or maybe Raymond Babbitt from ""Rain Man."" (The latter comparison pops out of a scene when Mark turns away from a meeting and declares with bizarre detachment ""Its raining out."") This Mark combines a borderline autistic affect with a single-minded focus on a beautifully simple idea and a mouth-brain connection that spits out words--eerily astute words often used in angry phrases--at hyper-hip-hop speed. During his days at Harvard hes as much a stranger to others feelings as he is a Mozart of computer programming so its no coincidence that his seminal addictive and immeasurably profitable concept a network to link friends with other friends ad infinitum starts out as sexual taxonomy--an online scheme called Facemash using college girls faces to rate whos hot and whos not. Those who arent addicts or dont use the site at all--Id call myself a cautious user--may be tempted to see Facebook as a not-so-hot notion fanned into incandescence by narcissistic adolescents with nothing better to do than tell one another who they are in terms of what they like what they buy and where they go. But the script makes a convincing case for Mr. Zuckerbergs awareness from the start that hed be tapping into a deep human need for friendship at a time when physical and spiritual isolation was on the rise. Facebook really was the once-in-a-generation idea the movie keeps saying it was and ""The Social Network"" is fully equal to the challenge of dramatizing the Big Bang that brought the site into being. More Speakeasy The Social Network Review Revue (09/30/10) Justin Timberlake on Why He Doesnt Use Facebook (09/28/10) Social Network Goes to Harvard (09/27/10) For Facebook Movie Damage Control (09/24/10) Zuckerberg Plans 100 Million Donation (09/23/10) That includes plenty of sex drugs and rock n roll--girls getting wasted while their brainiac boyfriends write code. Sean Parker the co-founder of the file-sharing web site Napster must have taken no exception to Justin Timberlakes blithely scandalous portrait of his younger self since he hasnt filed a lawsuit and he must have been delighted--I know I was--by the nimble humor and dancers grace of Mr. Timberlakes portrayal. (Among many passages of scintillating dialogue is a rapid-fire exchange between the affluent Sean who comes on like a slacker collecting unemployment and a bright but skeptical girl ""Im an entrepreneur."" ""You mean youre unemployed."" ""Im an entrepreneur."" ""So whats your latest preneur?"") But the films substance lies mainly in its convoluted tale of vast ambition--an ambition oddly disconnected in Mr. Zuckerbergs case from a desire to make money--spectacular success and bitter betrayal. Not since ""Apollo 13"" has a mainstream motion picture conveyed so much factual as well as dramatic information with such clarity and agility. First Mark moves beyond--or pilfers the intellectual property of--three upperclassmen whod approached him for help on a website they called Harvard Connection. Later the newly-minted young magnate has a painful falling out with Facebooks original business manager Eduardo Saverin hes played with great subtlety and rueful charm by Andrew Garfield wholl be seen as Peter Parker in the next ""Spider-Man."" While the movies prevailing mood is excitation--hardly a moment goes by when someone isnt having a brilliant idea--its dominant mode is litigation thanks to one suit on behalf of those Harvard upperclassmen and another brought by Eduardo. The lawsuits require obligatory scenes of adversaries meeting and arguing in offices but youd never know they were obligatory because they interweave past and present to electrifying effect. Another marvelous office scene involves Lawrence Summers (played by an actor not by himself) who was Harvards president at the time. The director Mr. Fincher makes no distinction between action or exposition between a conference-room confrontation or an English regatta. He stages every moment with fearless energy and a firm touch and turns the rapier wit of Mr. Sorkins script into verbal swordplay while Mr. Eisenberg makes Mark a digital Zorro slashing his way through Silicon Valley. Thats a phenomenal performance by any measure. The intensity of Marks aggressivity is fascinating though you keep waiting for him to reveal some fugitive trace of emotion. And the wait is rewarded when his psyche finally undergoes a subtle change. Its like the just-in-time delivery of a crucial part. ""The Social Network"" is powered by impeccable craftsmanship. Rooney Mara the young actress wholl be playing Lisbeth Salander in Mr. Finchers English-language version of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" is impressive as Erica the girl in the preface who likens Mark to an exercise machine. Donald Graham Burt did the production design. The elegant cinematography is the work of Jeff Cronenweth (who comes by it naturally; his late father Jordan was one of the best shooters of his time). Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross wrote the hard-driving music which reflects the nature of Marks mind while the sound design by Ren Klyce is reminiscent of Johnny Greenwoods wonderfully woozy score for ""There Will Be Blood."" Its the sound of ambition untethered. Let Me In ENLARGE Chloe Grace Moretz left as a young vampire and Kodi Smit-McPhee as the neighbor who befriends her in Let Me In. Overture Films Two years ago a Swedish vampire movie called ""Let the Right One In"" was greeted on these shores by glowing reviews. As one of its many admirers I called it remarkably fine and genuinely frightening and reserved special praise for the elegance of Tomas Alfredsons direction and the formal beauty of Hoyte Van Hoytemas cinematography. The film was also greeted by box office revenues reflective of the unfortunate fact that mainstream audience wont turn out for foreign films with subtitles that require reading. Fortunately the English-language version the title of which has reasonably been shortened was written and directed by Matt Reeves whose previous feature was the accomplished sci-fi thriller ""Cloverfield."" His new one works a number of changes on ""Let the Right One In"" though much of it follows the original shot for shot. But this is more than a respectful remake; ""Let Me In"" is quietly stylish and thoroughly chilling in its own right. Watch a clip from the film ""Let Me In"" starring Kodi Smit-McPhee Chloe Moretz and Richard Jenkins. The action has been transferred from suburban in Sweden to small-town Los Alamos in 1983; if the New Mexico locale whispers aliens thats no coincidence. As before the standard genders of the vampire genre are reversed. The story centers on a boy whos the victim of schoolyard bullies (his name is Owen and hes played by Kodi Smit-McPhee) and his androgynous new neighbor whos now called Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz the distinctive heroine of ""Kick-Ass"" which is a credit that warrants both flaunting and living down). Abby needs blood to live but Owen needs a buddy to survive so its a match made in a hell that resembles heaven. (Greig Fraser did the austere cinematography and Michael Giacchino contributed the fine score.) Richard Jenkins plays Abbys unnamed facilitator; his grisly rituals reminded me of Alfred Hitchcocks effort in ""The Torn Curtain"" to show how difficult it can be to kill someone with bare hands. The two young leads are limited vocally--their dialogue scenes sometimes devolve into drone duets--but they make an improbably and magnetically loving couple even if one of the lovers doesnt qualify as human. DVD FOCUS ENLARGE Panic Room (2002) Jodie Foster is a newly divorced mother and Kristen Stewart is her young daughter in this ingenious thriller directed by David Fincher from a screenplay by David Koepp. Mother and daughter are first seen in a house-hunting expedition on Manhattans Upper West Side where a real-estate agent showing them through a vast empty brownstone says ""Its a very emotional property."" This proves to be an understatement. One of the brownstones selling points is a panic room a high-tech refuge from disaster or home invasion and whats the point of a panic-room movie if the home isnt promptly invaded? Zombieland (2009) I mentioned ""Zombieland"" a couple of weeks ago in my review of ""Easy A"" since the star of that high school comedy Emma Stone plays the larcenous Wichita in this improbably delicious horror comedy. But the movie really belongs to Jesse Eisenbergs wistful but tenacious neurotic who calls himself Columbus and Woody Harrelsons tight-jawed gun-slinging Tallahassee. (Wichitas kid sister Little Rock is played somewhat tentatively by Abigail Breslin.) Dont expect anything more from the film than entertainment but dont expect less. The director Ruben Fleischer and the writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick sustain a high degree of silliness. The Road (2009) All too few people populate this film which was directed by John Hillcoat and adapted from the Cormac McCarthy novel. Its concerned mainly with a father (Viggo Mortensen) and son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) slogging across a slag-heap American landscape after the planet has suffered an unexplained apocalypse that killed the flora the fauna and most of the spectrum (though the sickly light from a blighted sun does manage to produce one wan rainbow). In a brief but memorable appearance Robert Duvall finds fleeting poetry in an old mans attempt to talk about his own son. --Joe Morgenstern Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Donald Trump Lashes Out at Michael Bloomberg GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

A thinking-mans women-in-jeopardy picture ""Panic Room"" does about as much as humanly possible with its deliberately restricted one-setting premise. Smartly plotted convincingly acted and brilliantly executed technically this engrossing thriller adds some clever modern wrinkles to the time-tested formula of sinister intruders threatening innocents in their home. Satisfyingly worked out so as to avoid most of the credibility-bursting contrivances cliches and coincidences of the genre Sony release has what it takes to attract audiences of all stripes as well as to put Jodie Foster in the commercial winners circle for the first time in years. Recalling everything from ""Lady in a Cage"" and ""Repulsion"" to ""Rear Window"" and Edgar Allan Poes celebrated suffocation fantasy ""The Cask of Amontillado"" which is drolly referenced David Koepps chess game of a screenplay makes central use of a little-known feature of the homes of numerous wealthy people these days -- ""safe"" rooms into which the imperiled can retreat in the event of break-ins natural disasters or even just paranoia-triggering events. Akin to the castle keep in the Middle Ages these sanctuaries are concrete-and-steel cocoons designed to be impenetrable by any conventional means and sufficiently well stocked to sustain their occupants for up to a month. Adding a nice perspective on this phenomenon is the fact that Fosters character is a bit creeped out by the claustrophobic panic room itself. Taking over a role Nicole Kidman couldnt continue after three weeks due to a knee injury Foster plays Meg Altman whos depressed over her husband having left her for another woman but whose financial settlement obviously rivals Ivana Trumps given the enormous Upper West Side townhouse she takes for herselfand her sullen pubescent daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart) after the bust-up. After expending 20 minutes to set up the basics and show off the apartment in what are just the first of many virtuoso camera moves that combine sinewy cranes with audacious CG touches director David Fincher jumps right into the meat of the drama On the womens first night (a very dark and rainy one to be sure) in their new home three men break into the premises. The elaborate security system outfitted with myriad video cameras enable Meg whos been tossing fitfully after drinking too much red wine to see where the guys are and retreat in the nick of time with Sarah to the panic room which is just off Megs boudoir. But even before the two sides square off fissures appear among the intruders that threaten to abort their mission before it begins. Burnham (Forest Whitaker) a security professional who has designed panic rooms himself is pissed that his jumpy partner Junior (Jared Leto) has turned up with a low-life cohort the masked Raoul (Dwight Yoakam) without warning him. Surprised as well by the presence of occupants Burnham wants to call off the whole gig the object of which is removing the 3 million Junior claims is hidden in the panic room but agrees to continue with the proviso that no one gets hurt. Once Meg and Sarah become ensconced in their bunker Burnham realizes they will have to be lured out somehow and he scoffs at his less rational cohorts as they pointlessly try to break in with a sledgehammer. Thus begin the cat-and-mouse maneuvers of the drama a game in which each side enjoys a key advantage Meg is able to follow the baddies movements on her monitors while Burnham knows the panic room inside and out far better than she does. In the battle of nerves that ensues the opponents take turns attempting long-shot ploys Burnham diabolically finds a way to force gas through a duct into the panic room which Meg even more ingeniously turns back on the attackers; Sarah discovers a hole through which she can SOS the neighbors across the courtyard if only they will wake up and take heed; Meg leaves her cocoon briefly to retrieve her cell phone which she must then hook up to an independent phone cable to call for help just as Burnham realizes what shes doing and tries to cut the line; Sarahs blood sugar goes dangerously low forcing another emergency run out of the room and the hot-headed Junior quits in frustration but not before informing that theres a lot more money upstairs than he originally let on. Yarns final third inevitably involves more direct contact table-turning and blood-letting than whats gone before but it all unfolds more or less plausibly in ways that dont forego dramatic and psychological coherence or that produce the sort of oh-come-on snorts of derision that such fare triggers more often than not. Literally boxing the action into such a small space physically and with so few characters obviously limits a writers options and Koepp has done a good job keeping the balance of menace and possible salvation topsy-turvy and creating two characters Meg and Burnham who by rights should never have been thrown into mortal combat in the first place. Like many imperiled heroines before her Meg has never been prepared to fight a battle to the death and Foster fortunately keeps her real by keeping her reactions to events rational and improvisational and by not allowing Meg to assume superwoman proportions. Whitaker adroitly handles an even more conflicted and nuanced role that of a morally principled working man who has mistakenly allowed himself to be suckered into a criminal act in the belief that its his one chance in life for a big score. Other perfs are effective but strictly one-dimensional including those of Leto as the hysterically unbalanced ringleader Yoakam as the untrustworthy thug and Stewart as Megs withdrawn daughter. Patrick Bauchau has one of the more unenviable screen roles of recent times as Megs ex who turns up in the middle of the night to help only to be pummeled incessantly for his efforts. As expected from the supreme technician Fincher pic has an arresting look. After abandoning the idea of shooting the film in total darkness with only eyes and flashes of light appearing onscreen helmer has still kept the light levels very low delivering perhaps the darkest mainstream Hollywood feature since Gordon Willis was in his prime. Pale ghostly images within the residence are contrasted with the very cool blue-gray in which the panic room scenes are bathed and Fincher has maintained a stylistic consistency despite the departure of original cinematographer Darius Khondji over ""creative differences"" and his replacement with Conrad W. Hall a Fincher camera crew regular and son of the great Conrad L. Hall. Production designer Arthur Maxs four-story townhouse set is a wonder its undecorated luxurious expanses creating an effectively forbidding atmosphere. Score by Howard Shore is of a piece with the film itself in its intelligent understated turbulence. Opening title sequence strikingly features credited names grandly brandished in the manner of building engravings across impressive Manhattan cityscapes.

For nearly two hours weve been following an endlessly clever variation on cat-and-mouse thats pitted a mother and daughter against three home invaders. The men -- and they have to be men for this to work for the entire setup to feel real enough to send shivers across our skin -- have broken into a New York City brownstone but instead of an empty house with hidden treasure theyve found a divorcee Meg (Jodie Foster) home alone with her only child 11-year-old Sarah (Kristen Stewart). Having heard the burglars Meg and Sarah have shut themselves in a secret chamber called the ""panic room"" a steel compartment stocked with food and medical supplies and equipped with a bank of surveillance screens. For much of the movie the men (played by Forest Whitaker Jared Leto and a persuasively scummy Dwight Yoakam) bang and clang against the room first with futility then with mounting fury. They want in desperately to do what invaders have always done -- to plunder perhaps to murder to fuck with their victims heads and perhaps their bodies. In other words to do precisely what Fincher likes to do in his movies his own cinematic panic rooms -- to fuck with your head to fuck with your body as mercilessly as he can. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The movie opens soon after Meg decides to buy the sprawling house with its four stories and miles of hall. Shes seen the panic room and shes afraid of it -- or of what it portends; soon before turning in for her first night in her new home she mutters about disabling its alarm system. As for the house itself it isnt simply impractical (it would take a fleet just to scrub the acres of floor) its extravagantly even self-consciously impractical one of those yawning cavernous spaces designed more for movie cranes and yards of dolly track than actual people. Yet if the house looks unreal by turns a castle a prison and a back-lot fantasia its two new inhabitants have the human fear factor down. Age has softened the angles in Fosters face and its made her beauty less brittle and less forbidding -- she no longer looks as if shed punish you for telling her how lovely she is. In the process shes also cast off the sanctimony shes worn in too many of her grown-up roles while losing none of her technique. Always adept at hitting emotional cues cleanly Foster in this role also lets herself get lost in the moment which is something she hasnt often allowed herself to do since The Silence of the Lambs. It takes a while to get what shes doing. Much of what Fosters called on to do in Panic Room initially seems fairly routine -- she plays ""scared"" up and down the scale -- but as the story wears on the actress seems to shed her reserve her buffer of cool professionalism to tap into a darker richer characterization. And while she never grows frenzied what she does with her performance in the films climax is remarkable. At the moment that Meg expects the worst Foster drains her face of horror leaving an emptied-out becalmed surprise that seems like wonderment like awe like the moment right before the sword pierces the saint. Foster turns Megs terror into grace a transformation that Fincher sets against blurs of red and a progression of screams so intense so shockingly animal theyre almost unbearable. Its an extraordinary scene not because it represents the apotheosis of the directors technical virtuosity in the film -- the craft remains unassailable throughout -- but because it is the one moment in Panic Room we forget that virtuosity. For the first time in this well-wrought if unsurprising thriller Finchers potential to become one of our greatest directors bursts through the tricks the feints and worst of all the scripted cliches. But by then the movies almost over. FINCHERS TALENT HAS ALWAYS BEEN OBVIOUS TO me which is why its always a surprise when smart critics dismiss him. His detractors tend to hold the directors sadism against him yet its unlikely they would (or could) if he picked better material. Finchers films are often extremely graphic in their depictions of the sordid unpleasant and even more revolting sides of human behavior (you dont go to his films to feel good about the world) but when it comes to the aesthetics of cruelty he has nothing on Hitchcock. Unlike Hitchcock however who mined poetry and pulp from the likes of Patricia Highsmith and Cornell Woolrich Fincher has generally worked with rotten writers including Panic Rooms David Koepp whose robust career -- from Jurassic Park to Snake Eyes -- remains one of Hollywoods ongoing mysteries. It isnt as if the films premise required brilliant invention; it is essentially a very elaborate variant of tag. Thats fine as far as it goes but Fincher is better than that and his script should be too. What he needed was a writer who could transcend genre who could reach deep into the subject of home security to tell us something about our obsession with safety and surveillance an obsession which even before September 11 has turned homes offices and even the country itself into panic rooms of one sort or another. The thing is when you lock up characters in a confined space -- a house a lifeboat a wheelchair -- you need to shade in their personalities and give them the breath of life of purpose. You also need to give them something to say other than the usual tough-guy grunts and cheap pop-culture asides. When one character tells another in the film not to give him some ""Elmore Leonard bullshit"" I wanted to hurl a copy of Stick at the screen.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm Maybe I should just send one to Fincher instead. Of the five features hes directed only the screenplay for Fight Club was any good and even that went astray. Is it the directors fault? Its impossible to say from the outside; I just wish hed let his friend Steven Soderbergh start picking his scripts. Soderbergh isnt as naturally gifted a director as Fincher -- though hes come a long way with his last four features toward closing the gap -- but over the years hes become the sort of cannily intelligent filmmaker who can shoot his way around a scripts weakness. Watching Panic Room you realize that Fincher either doesnt know the material is bad or doesnt care perhaps because hes too busy trying to puzzle through its logistics. Theres some genuinely fun stuff in Panic Room At one point the camera seems to swoop into a lock mechanism as nimbly as Tinker Bell; at other times it appears to pass through walls as in Hitchcocks Rope. But in Fight Club the fun stuff served the film just as in Rope the claustrophobia of the set helped to torque the suspense. Here by contrast too much of the alley-oop camerawork and the digital sleight of hand seem designed to hold not just our interest but the directors. Its as if after being burned for Fight Club one of the best and most maligned films of 1999 Fincher has decided theres no point in complex ideas. As the success of Seven and the failure of Fight Club proved American audiences dont want too much intelligence illuminating the dark. Again theres just no denying Finchers gifts. Give the guy a camera or two or three millions upon millions of dollars and state-of-the-art technologies and theres no stopping him. Its more than just money though. Unlike a lot of directors his love of overblown films with equally inflated effects is about pushing the limits of the medium; even on a smaller budget there would be no denying his genius for mise en scene. He simply cant take a bad shot. In the end Panic Room isnt disappointing because the director stinks but because his is the sort of prodigious talent contemporary Hollywood will bankroll but not nurture. Even auteurs need producers to tell them when a script sucks or a scenes gone baggy. Whats surprising then is how much intended or not Fincher wrings from unexpected sources. Kristen Stewart the girl who plays the daughter was cast before Finchers first choice for Meg Nicole Kidman left the film because of an injury. Stewart has Fosters blue eyes blond hair and sturdy no-nonsense beauty and she comes across as one of those girls who has no patience for feminine rubbish. The resemblance is more than serendipitous -- its freaky. Stewart doesnt only look like Foster she looks like Foster did when she had no patience for girly-girl rubbish either right around the same time she became psycho-fantasy jailbait. When those two blond heads fill the frame with their dread the image sounds a queasy reverberant note. Its the same queasy note sounded during the opening credits when Howard Shores dirge-like score accompanies a series of aerial shots of a New York where the buildings are packed tightly as tombstones.

Directed by David Fincher from a screenplay by David Koepp. 108 minutes. Rated R for violence and language. Several theaters. E-mail this article Print this article Something about the opening of David Finchers ""Panic Room"" immediately brings to mind Alfred Hitchcocks classic tale of voyeurism ""Rear Window"" -- the leisurely shots of New York apartment buildings with their banks of faceless windows; the vaguely 50s-style lettering of the credits; the ominous sense that behind each of these windows lies a story if only we could see inside. And ""Panic Room"" does indeed turn out to be about voyeurism but of a flashier and far less human sort. Its a triumph of technical filmmaking; as a story its got ice in its heart. Nonetheless its a treat to see long-absent Jodie Foster back on screen and she does her flinty best with the somewhat thankless role of Meg Altman a single mom smarting from a recent divorce. At the movies start Meg and her daughter have just moved into a posh Manhattan townhouse containing a ""panic room"" -- a high-tech shelter to be used in the event of danger -- and from the murky looks of things very few working light fixtures. Weve barely met Meg and young Sarah (Kristen Stewart) when on their very first night in the house some nasty intruders show up and the cat-and-mouse game begins. (Why dont Meg and Sarah just call for help from the panic room you say? Well if they could do that there wouldnt be a movie.) But ""Panic Rooms"" two inventive directors of photography Conrad W. Hall (son of the legendary cinematographer Conrad L. Hall who won his most recent Oscar for ""American Beauty"") and Darius Khondji (who shot Finchers equally dark ""Seven"") are the films real stars. Their cameras seamlessly whoosh through keyholes under counters and through floors giving us a moody roller-coaster tour of the dark house. Later as the movie explodes into violence the camera becomes a brutal kick in the face. Its all very stylish and cool in a disembodied sort of way -- were not seeing any of this through the eyes of a person but through a camera that in some ways is more of a character than anyone on screen. The people all are one-note Meg is brave and strong; little Sarah is a mini-Meg; the three intruders (Forest Whitaker Jared Leto Dwight Yoakam) are smart dumb and evil respectively. Whitakers character turns out to have a conscience which gives the actor something to play but otherwise the story is secondary to the visual thrill ride. You find yourself curious about where the camera will go next not what will happen to the people its capturing. ""Panic Room"" is an accomplished and often elegant film and David Koepps screenplay has some nicely pared-down dialogue. (Sarah asked if her mom is rich replies ""No my dads rich. Moms just mad."") But when its over you wonder what the point was -- why exactly Fincher wanted to tell this story. Foster in an enigmatic final close-up looks like shes wondering too.

PANIC-C-26MAR02-DD-HO Kristen Stewart left and Jodie Foster in PANIC ROOM. Photo HO Panic attack / Foster at her best in mindless exciting thriller 1 / 1 Back to Gallery THE PANIC ROOM Thriller. Starring Jodie Foster Kristen Stewart Forest Whitaker and Dwight Yoakam. Directed by David Fincher. (R. 108 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Director David Fincher has a shot in ""The Panic Room"" that would have made Hitchcock proud. I have no idea how he did it but this is how it goes It starts with a woman sleeping in her third-floor bedroom moves away from her to the stairwell and goes down two flights to a room from which we can see through the window a car pulling up. Were just getting started. The camera waits with perverse curiosity (this camera has a personality) as men get out of a car. Then it moves to a door and -- this is a jolt -- it seems to dive into and out of the keyhole. Obviously the keyhole trick is some kind of computer effect but it seems real and the flow remains unbroken as the camera backs up and starts whipping through rooms then goes back upstairs past the womans bedroom and all the way to the roof. The camera is recording a scene of breaking and entering and its doing it with not only flair but also apparent pleasure. Its enjoying the fact that it knows things the characters dont just as Fincher seems to be savoring his virtuosity. The rest of ""The Panic Room"" might not live up to that one flash of cinematic gorgeousness but its still a strong thriller because it never forgets its audience. It might sometimes forget to make sense but no matter since it creates enough tension that the audience can hardly think anyway. FOSTER IN PEAK FORM Jodie Foster stars and its a pleasure for once to see her in something entertaining and mindless. Unlike most Foster films of the past 10 years theres no aura of earnestness about this one. The movie comes with no implicit assurance that if you see it you will be a better person. Yet the very absence of those qualities makes ""The Panic Room"" an excellent showcase for her talents. With no higher purpose to her performance Foster can only rely on her ability to sustain an emotional connection with her audience. She does it expertly. HIDING IN PANIC ROOM She plays the newly divorced mother of a young teenage girl who moves into a massive four-story Manhattan brownstone for reasons that only screenwriter David Koepp could possibly fathom. Thats 4200 square feet between two people. Conveniently the house is equipped with something called a panic room. In case of a break-in its enclosed in steel impossible to penetrate and has TV monitors showing everything going on in the other rooms. A person could hide in there for a long time. ""The Panic Room"" gets Foster and Kristen Stewart who plays the daughter into that room in the first 20 minutes. It also gets three desperate crooks on the outside of that room -- Forest Whitaker as a home-security expert gone bad; Dwight Yoakam as a maniac in a mask; and Jared Leto as the idiot who fancies himself leader of the trio. The women hide and the men try to get in. Thats the simple premise that the filmmakers take and with a fair degree of ingenuity milk for an additional 88 minutes of excitement. Going into details would only spoil those details. Without its surprises ""The Panic Room"" would have nothing to recommend it -- or at least very little besides a convincing Foster performance. Foster once won an Oscar for acting terrified and she hasnt lost her touch. Whats also welcome is the aura of integrity that Foster lends this desperate woman. In other films when Foster tries to play integrity it seems as if shes protesting too much. Here shes not trying and something innate comes through. . This film contains graphic violence.

Not since ""Wait Until Dark"" (1967) ""The Lady In A Cage"" (1964) and Alfred Hitchcocks ""Rear Window"" (1954) has a movie captured a murderous game of cat-and-mouse with this much directorial command and heart-stopping success. Director David Fincher (""Seven"" 1995; ""Fight Club"" 1999) is a genius at building dramatic tension with subtle foreshadowing that lets the viewer slowly put the pieces together while being drawn deeper and deeper into his claustrophobic and terrifying world. Foster plays Meg Altman a woman who has been dumped by her older and very rich husband. Meg and daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart) leave the upper-crust confines of Greenwich Connecticut and migrate to Manhattans Upper West Side where they buy a huge brownstone. Previously owned by an eccentric and paranoid millionaire who has recently died the brownstone has one very unique feature a ""panic room"" -- a room with its own phone and ventilation system; a room with TV monitors that can show every square inch of the four-story house; a room with impregnable steel walls and door.

"USATODAY.com - Panic Room opens door into a well-shot thriller Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 04/01/2002 - Updated 0504 PM ET Panic Room opens door into a well-shot thriller By Mike Clark USA TODAY Jodie Foster could be living a movie lovers dream in the efficiently directed fabulously shot but mundanely written Panic Room Shes locked in a room with eight TV monitors. But she has a few distractions in the contrived latest from David Fincher (Seven Fight Club) which ends up coasting on its great chiller gimmick. Read more below Related Foster plays it cool Video Watch the Panic Room trailer As a just-divorced mom who has socked her philandering husband for money to buy a spacious New York brownstone Foster spends her first night in the house in such a room with her diabetic daughter (Kristen Stewart). Seeking a haven when intruders do what intruders do they end up trapped in what was once a fortress for the previous owners millions. The concrete room has an impenetrable steel entrance a separate ventilation system private phone line loudspeaker first-aid equipment and all those monitors. But no insulin. Panic Room (out of four) Stars Jodie Foster Forest Whitaker Jared Leto Dwight Yoakam Kristen Stewart Director David Fincher Distributor Columbia Rating R for violence and language Each of the other accouterments comes in handy against baddies right out of Wait Until Dark and a directory of stock villains that writer David Koepp must have had at his side. The weakling caper mastermind (a ""Junior"" played by Jared Leto) is after more than his bequeathed share of the still-hidden fortune. His partners are the obligatory brute (Dwight Yoakam) and a sensitive technician (Forest Whitaker) who builds panic rooms for a living. Leto isnt very bright and hasnt gotten the word that a supposedly still-empty dwelling isnt. So here we are The thugs are in the house daughter with mom and in hiding. Foster can track the assailants over the monitors and voice agitated responses over the loudspeaker but these creeps can respond only via written communication because the rooms phone line isnt hooked up. Photographed in the darkest visible tones by newcomer Conrad W. Hall and Darius Khondhi (Seven) Room and its tilting/panning camera have a blast zipping through and around a dozen large rooms -- most of them unfamiliar to new resident Foster during brief escapes and pursuits (searches for insulin a cell phone) outside the panic room. Of course if one of the murder-bent thugs simply planted himself in front of the panic rooms door the story would be over. It also seems that the police are slow in responding to a distress call though admittedly the passing of time is tough to gauge. Because Rooms own time is limited to the 95-minute range things move fast enough to make it a movie to enjoy and then forget -- if you dont mind some above-average brutality seemingly left over from Finchers Brad Pitt-Edward Norton punch-outs. As Foster vehicles go its zestier than Nell or Anna and the King which would be tough to watch even if you were stuck in a room of monitors with nothing else to do.

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

The three intruders arrive with personalities as broad as vaudeville while Fosters character changes from intriguing uptight divorcee to generic gonna-make-it-after-all woman who can swing a mean mallet in self-defense.
