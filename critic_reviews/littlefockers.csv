I dont mean to rush Gaylord er Greg (Ben Stiller); Gregs laid-back Jewish parents Bernie and Roz ...2010-12-29Universal Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr YOU TALKIN TO ME? Third times not a charm when Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller square off in Little Fockers (Glen Wilson) Little Fockers Starring Robert De Niro Ben Stiller; Director Paul Weitz; Release Date Wide 12/22/2010; Distributor Universal Posted December 29 2010 -- 1200 AM EST Is it time to get the Fockers out of here? I dont mean to rush Gaylord er ""Greg"" (Ben Stiller); Gregs laid-back Jewish parents Bernie and Roz (Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand); or his uptight gentile in-laws Jack and Dina Byrnes (Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner) now that theyre all together again in Little Fockers. I dug the crazy clan a decade ago in Meet the Parents and enjoyed the bawdy Roz and Bernie show six years ago in Meet the Fockers. But comedy has changed. Jack can only give his son-in-law the stink eye so many times before the whole ""Im watching you"" pantomime gets stale. And when a wink-wink movie is reduced to the alleged hilarity of a little boy accidentally observing his father inject his grandpas penis (O poor Bobby D) -- the old guy having gobbled some erectile-dysfunction pills is stuck with one of those supposedly hilarious actually dangerous Viagra-esque side effects so recently not funny in Love amp; Other Drugs -- well it may be time to try another household for laughs. The importance of adult male responsibility in the development of the next generation (represented by the two little Fockers who now call Greg Daddy) is the substantive portion of this drearily coarsened sequel. (Director Paul Weitz replaces former Focker coach Jay Roach.) But whos kidding whom Little Fockers is much less interested in parental guidance than it is in gamy whoopee. Jessica Alba shows up as a babe of a flirtatious drug rep who turns crude and feral-horny when she too swallows ED pills. Streisands Roz offers graphic sex advice. And in the melee Hoffman casually steals the picture in his few scenes sometimes just with the flamenco moves Bernie has learned in his Spanish dance class. How Focked up is that?

At least the first two films had clear agendas first in Meet the Parents put-upon Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) had to win over his girlfriends father Jack Byrnes (Robert DeNiro) an ex-CIA hard man and then in Meet the Fockers he had to introduce Jack to his liberal Jewish parents (Dustin Hoffman Barbra Streisand). Now all we need is any old excuse - the approaching Fockers kids fifth birthday party - to bring everyone back together including Kevin (Owen Wilson) a hippy ex-banker and old flame of Gregs wife and watch as damp indoor fireworks limply explode in various directions. Again the main conflict is between Greg and Jack but its a tired old battle. Weve seen Jacks eccentric nighttime trails before just as weve seen Greg accidentally getting himself into hot water with his father-in-law (here over a mistaken case of adultery with a colleague at work). Hoffman and Streisand take a back seat but they shouldnt have bothered at all as the film can barely find anything for them to do bar Hoffman trying to mine comedy from his characters newfound love of flamenco. Worst of all one of the main gags is poor self-parody as Jack adopts mafia stylings as he tries to nominate his successor the God Focker. Very weak.

"Little Fockers A waste of time | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesLittle Fockers A waste of timeTen years after Meet the Parents implausibly took a stale sitcom premise to major box-office coin Robert De Niro is reduced to shilling for cheap laughs.Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller in the unfunny Little Fockers.  (GLEN WILSON PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticWed. Dec. 22 2010Little Fockers(out of 4)Starring Robert De Niro Ben Stiller Teri Polo Owen Wilson Blythe Danner Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman. Directed by Paul Weitz. 98 minutes. At major theatres. PGRobert De Niro one of the greatest actors of his generation stands before Ben Stiller demonstrating the effects of erectile dysfunction drugs on the male member.Fortunately De Niro is clothed. His diminished dignity however is nakedly exposed.Article Continued BelowYes it has come to this 10 years after Meet the Parents implausibly took a stale sitcom premise about awful in-laws to major box-office coin De Niro is reduced to shilling for the cheapest of laughs in the weakest of franchises.Little Fockers now under the helm of Chris Weitz after two installments directed by Jay Roach is the third and demonstrably worst in the series and De Niros strained antics are major reason for this.There is being a good sport and there is career suicide and De Niro is skating perilously close to the edge. I have to remind myself and perhaps you dear reader that De Niro was the star of Taxi Driver The Godfather II and Goodfellas.Little Fockers could erase all memories of his better days.The title refers not only to the inevitable offspring of Stillers in-law fearing Greg Focker and wife Pam (Teri Polo) but also to a vulgar surname pun that never was funny yet here is beaten into submission.So are the gags about De Niros cloak-and-dagger Jack Byrnes the ex-CIA man who is still the main focus of the gang-written script despite the title suggestion that this movie is about Gregs and Pams now 5-year-old twins precocious son Henry (Colin Baiocchi) and daughter Sam (Daisy Tahan).Jack a paranoid sourball is still talking about his ""circle of trust"" and irrationally hating on Greg for being a male nurse. Yet -- can you believe it? -- hes decided that Greg could be just the man to become patriarch of the extended family.Recent heart troubles have Jack thinking about another cloaked figure the one carrying a scythe.""Are you ready to be The Godfocker?"" Jack asks Greg and the audience groans.Just when it seems that the two are ready to kiss and make up -- literally --trouble arrives in the form of temptation. Jack doesnt approve of course and wife Dina (Blythe Danner) still sighs indulgently.Pams old boyfriend Kevin (Owen Wilson) is back in town having decided that Pam is really the one for him after all.Meanwhile Greg falls under the spell of sexy drug company rep Andi (Jessica Alba) who conspires to have him promote a new erectile dysfunction drug. Andis last name is Garcia which also for more tedious humour about names it sounds like Andy Garcia another Godfather actor Too funnyGreg and Andi ""meet cute"" (not) in a scene where they must insert a tube into the anus of a patient.Just to maintain continuity and build a marquee Gregs sex-crazed parents Bernie (Dustin Hoffman) and Roz Focker (Barbra Streisand) are also back. Production note Hoffman was supposed to have minor screen time for this one but his presence was beefed up via a contrived trip to Spain after early test screenings suggested he was needed.The only invention in this mirthless mess is the contortions needed to have Jack being both a heart patient and a dabbler in erectile dysfunction drugs. Viagra is contraindicated for some heart patients so the script invents a new drug that can be safely used by them.This means Andi can con Greg into promoting the stiffener at a medical convention even though Greg is a nurse not a doctor. It also means that De Niro can participate in that ever-popular gag about the accidental four-hour erection.Are you laughing yet? Didnt think so.The only good thing that can be said about Little Fockers is that all concerned waited six years from middle installment Meet the Fockers before foisting this one upon us. That shows unusual restraint for this series. Otherwise its a complete Focking waste of time.Can we please stop meeting these parents?The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Comments click to enlarge Little Fockers Rated PG-13  98 minutes  2010 The opening minutes offer so many knowing satirical barbs--about parenting about pharmaceutical sales reps--that I had high hopes for this comedy sequel. But theyd already faded by the time the Viagra gags culminated in Ben Stiller sinking a hypodermic needle into Robert De Niros erection. The Focker franchise has become such a swell payday (Meet the Parents grossed 166 million; Meet the Fockers 279 million) that now everyone wants in on the act; apparently even the original stars are allowed only a plus-one with De Niro joined by Harvey Keitel (used briefly and to little effect) and Stiller by Owen Wilson (as a flaky new-age type). Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman return as Stillers parents from Meet the Fockers and the supporting cast includes Laura Dern Jessica Alba and Thomas McCarthy. Blythe Danner and Teri Polo as De Niros wife and daughter must have felt grateful that they were even allowed on the lot. Paul Weitz directed. By J.R.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday Dec. 22 2010 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 311PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English At the dawn of their careers Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel shared the screen during the wrenching climax to one of the great films in the American canon. Back then they made history. Now reunited in a comedy franchise as lame as it is lucrative theyre collecting a paycheque. Good for them sad for us. In time the distance from Taxi Driver to Little Fockers is easy to measure - 34 years. But in every other way it just seems incalculable. Movies Little Fockers The official trailer Movies Liam Laceys holiday guide to the movies And since were on the subject of ""once upon a time"" lets flash back a mere decade to Meet the Parents the franchises first chapter. There a very funny movie kept trying to get out yet what began as a potentially sharp romcom eventually morphed into dull farce. Yep it was a pretty good show until somebody made a business decision. In the sequels since in Meet the Fockers and now this thing its simply been business as usual. Translation The stars are back De Niro and Blythe Danner heading the WASP half of the clan Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand suiting up for the Focker side with Ben Stiller stuck in the middle again and looking to broker a separate peace. Strange though how the biggest names are the worst offenders here all mugging to the camera and chewing any scenery in sight. Ironically its Stiller who offers the titans a lesson in comic acting - at least amid the frenzy he keeps his fraying character in dignified check and tries to underplay the farce. Tries but consider what the guys up against. The de rigueur puke scene arrives early when one of the diminutive additions to the cast (so cleverly hinted at in the title) treats us to the second coming of his spaghetti dinner. Of course dinner is always a trial in these family affairs a tradition that continues with this classic lesson in the higher math of hijinks Carving knife + severed artery = tons of bloody fun. Soon after comes the now familiar litany of erectile dysfunction laughs familiar enough that I need hardly remind you of that eye-popping moment when the camera points trouser-wards and the running joke swells into a sight gag. Sadly this flick isnt in 3D. Still its comforting to see how fast-acting these drugs are Already in the factory of movie comedy cliches Viagra and its ilk can take pride of place right beside the banana peel. Meanwhile more nuttiness Streisand is peddling sex advice to seniors; Hoffman appears to be suffering from acute bodily spasms (although the plot assures us hes just learning the flamenco); Owen Wilson is back laying bare his way-too-sensitive soul; and newcomer Jessica Alba stripped to her skivvies is just laying bare. Not to be outdone a squinting De Niro now that the big trouble in his trousers has abated gets to play Oscar Wilde when urging the role of family patriarch onto his son-in-law he asks with piercing wit ""Are you prepared to be ... the godfocker?"" Oh fellow pun-meisters the possibilities are endless but Ill leave you to imagine them. As for Keitel he pops up in a brief cameo as a housing contractor with a dump-truck full of sand the one that De Niro is standing right behind. The pair engage in a heated argument as they once did so memorably those many years ago and then the truck dumps that load exactly where you know it must. An esteemed actor gets buried but what-the-fock the franchise laughs on.

""Little Fockers"" may not be the worst most vulgar most pathetic and least funny picture of the year. But its a strong contender for second place behind the picture Brett Favre allegedly sent over his cellphone. According to the third film in the Ben Stiller-Robert De Niro ""Focker"" series the worst so far comedy means slapping up some situation that would never happen having someone else stumble in to misread things and when lost getting everyone to repeat bits from the earlier movies or simply say ""Focker."" A lot. Even when it makes no sense Visiting his son-in-law Gaylord/Greg Focker (Stiller) for an inexplicably lengthy two weeks before the grandchildrens birthday party Jack Byrnes (De Niro) worries about mortality and wants to tap the next family leader. So he solemnly asks Greg ""Are you prepared to be . . . the Godfocker?"" (Cue ""Godfather"" music.) Is it likely that this could be a nickname for the head of the Byrnes clan? Which naturally Jack would want to be led by someone who is not a blood relative whom he doesnt like. Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand as the senior Fockers turn up to address their son as ""Gay"" or to talk loudly about their sex habits. Jessica Alba -- her pharmaceutical-sales rep is supposed to get laughs because she is named ""Andi Garcia"" -- shows up at male nurse Fockers hospital inexplicably signs him up to give speeches on her erectile-dysfunction drug then strips down to her undies and jumps him -- while Jack is spying on poor Gaylord. Im not even sure the real Ben Stiller the funny one with the nine-figure net worth could get Jessica Alba. But Gaylord the married harried he-nurse the man who spends his days wielding an enema tube -- Gaylord the woebegone thousandaire? And even if she did want you and was blind to all of the rich surgeons all around would she have to undress and hurl herself on you? Has Jessica Alba ever had to put that much effort into anything? Out of nowhere Stiller and De Niro do a parody of the subway chase from ""The French Connection."" (They sure picked the wrong audience for that gag -- ""CSI"" jokes would have been better.) Without much cause a now sadly middle-aged Owen Wilson hangs around again as the golden best friend to flirt with Gregs wife again (accidentally he got a giant back tattoo of her). Jack having taken erectile-dysfunction drugs gets stuck in a persistent state of excitement (which is not a condition anyone will otherwise associate with this film) for the sole reason that the movie wants us to imagine (nothing is shown) Greg plunging a giant syringe into Jacks er little focker. Even more alarmingly -- in this scene the camera doesnt cut away -- Wilson kisses Streisand. As it struggles to fill a directionless hour and a half the movie devises comedy setups that go nowhere. A would-be spoof of competitive kindergartens leads us all the way to . . . Jack and Greg being mistaken for a gay couple. Jack that old superspy spies on Greg who . . . immediately catches him. Jack says hes just looking for milk and goes away. De Niro and Harvey Keitel as a lazy contractor come face to face and . . . yell boringly at each other about a hole in the ground that isnt supposed to be there. One wonders at what point on the set Harvey and Bob caught each other in a gaze that said ""You know -- we did Mean Streets and Taxi Driver together."" More likely They simply averted their glances in shame. ""Little Fockers"" which is as funny as the two heart attacks suffered by Jack sprints past ""unfunny"" is still going strong when it reaches ""disaster"" and easily reaches ""cautionary tale."" Director Paul Weitz has made three straight movies (including ""American Dreamz"" and ""Cirque du Freak The Vampires Assistant"") of such boundless ineptitude that Id rather watch student films or even ""Glee."" Writers John Hamburg and Larry Stuckey should have their headshots and names displayed on the walls at comedy writing workshops for the same reason drivers ed classes had those memorable films of car crashes. ""Can a girl poop from her vagina?"" a kid asks at a family dinner. No son but youd be surprised what can come out of a hacks word processor.

"Movie review Little Fockers - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMovie review Little FockersThe tension between Ben Stillers and Robert De Niros characters has gone flat. The third film in the franchise just isnt funny.December 22 2010|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic What was so fresh and funny about ""Meet the Parents"" with Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro at serious comic odds has gone so foul in ""Little Fockers"" that it is incredibly tempting to resort to the implied off-color word play made possible by the Focker name and suggest that this third edition is totally a but I wont. Instead Ill just leave it that the comedys gone missing the puns are tortured (to say nothing of the audience) and the movies central question a whether or not Stillers Greg Focker has the ahem chutzpah to be ""the Godfocker"" a is but one indication of how low this ship has sunk. The sheer pleasure of the first film in 2000 already dimming by the time we got to ""Meet the Fockers"" four years later has officially gone kaput. There was hope going in that the increasing propensity to wring its one-note gag dry might not be indulged by director Paul Weitz who has proved to have a sharp but sentimental touch with relationship comedy notably in collaboration with brother Chris on 2002s ""About a Boy."" Sadly the sentiment in ""Little Fockers"" has overwhelmed the sharpness and not to good effect. With the warring parties having settled into an uneasy but still identifiable detente it has left the film a flaccid mess which speaks to the other key story line a new drug that delivers Viagra-esque benefits to men prone to heart attacks. Since you know an experiment with said drug will have to pop up at some point be sure to have your cringes ready. As the name suggests ""Little Fockers"" written by John Hamburg part of the complicated collective behind the first two and Larry Stuckey means there are even more children to go along with the childish games played by De Niros Jack Byrnes the ex- CIA agent who still cant give up covert operations. The new kids on the block are Focker twins Samantha and Henry ( Daisy Tahan and Colin Baiocchi). They are about to turn 5 and there is a party for Greg and Pam ( Teri Polo) to plan as well as a double-dose of in-laws in town. Meanwhile Jacks once perfect son-in-law Dr. Bob ( Thomas McCarthy) has had a marriage dissolving dalliance. To make sure it doesnt happen to Pam Nurse Greg is back under Jacks microscope. Most of the regulars are back too with mama Roz Focker ( Barbra Streisand) now a TV star with her own sex therapy show her dearly beloved Dustin Hoffmans Bernie is off Flamenco-ing in Spain Blythe Danners Dina is still sweetly suffering Jacks obsessions and Owen Wilsons Kevin is still in love with Pam. That the characters remain so static suggests how little there was to work with in the first place with Wilsons quirky sensibility suffering the stagnation the best which means only that the time passes faster when he shows up. From the first the comedy has rested on the sight gags the sexual innuendo and any conceivable pun that might result. A steady stream of options is provided here by that wonder drug. It also allows the filmmakers to introduce a giddy pretty drug rep named Andi Garcia ( Jessica Alba) responsible for Gregs primary temptation and a zillion Andi/Andy Garcia ""jokes."" Ha ha ha. What little conflict the filmmakers could conjure up is tied to Greg and Jacks friction over typical middle-class issues renovating that first house getting the kids into private school building the nest egg and keeping the love alive. But the undermining espionage that should make for all the fun is so predictable and excessively over the top it rarely works. The exception is a terrific turn by Laura Dern as Prudence the politically over-corrected head of the coveted private school. She brings a kind of arch unctuous fun to every absurd line she delivers during her very short stay. But as for the rest I dont care what they say misery does not need company lets let the ""Little Fockers"" handle that one by themselves. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com Little Fockers MPAA rating PG-13 for mature sexual humor throughout language and some drug content Running time 1 hour 38 minutes Playing In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESThe Directors Paul Weitz and Little FockersOctober 31 2010Introspective and at easeApril 10 2005Meeting a real-life Focker proves difficultJanuary 7 2005Meet the Fockers One big happy family?

""Little Fockers"" is an overstuffed jumble that goes light on the one thing that it needs most - laughs.  | 1/2 out of 4 stars By Colin Covert Star Tribune December 21 2010 -- 224pm Glen Wilson Universal Pictures Colin Baiocchi left and Ben Stiller in ""Little Fockers."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint I thought it would take years for Owen Wilson to appear in a movie worse than ""How Do You Know"" but he has outdone himself. In a mere matter of days he has reached a new professional nadir along with the rest of the cast of ""Little Fockers."" It is a sad broken defeated thing seasonal depression on celluloid. In what we can only pray is the finale to this series of comedies about a wimpy male nurse locked in psychological warfare with his domineering father-in-law the same forced tired gags are belabored to exhaustion. This film isnt just beating a dead horse its pulverizing the carcass. Nothing much has changed in the household of Gaylord Focker (a weary-looking disengaged Ben Stiller) except that everyone is a few years older. Wealthy bohemian Kevin (Wilson) still has the hots for Gregs wife Pam (Teri Polo). Greg still chafes under the thumb of his suspicious father-in-law retired CIA spook Jack Byrnes (Robert De Niro). Jack who has had a few heart twinges feels its time to pass the mantle of family patriarch to Greg. ""Are you ready to be the GodFocker?"" he demands. That line is the verbal pinnacle of a story line that presents enemas projectile puke erectile dysfunction and naughty-mouthed children as untapped wellsprings of mirth. In a perverse way the levity-free script proves that De Niro is a truly brilliant actor. If he was actually the tough jamoke he so often plays he would have kneecapped screenwriters John Hamburg and Larry Stuckey with a Louisville Slugger. Dustin Hoffman who made no secret of being unhappy with the script finally accepted a fortune to reprise his role as Bernie Focker. His jaundiced feelings about the project appear to surface in a scene where Bernie offers another character a whoopee cushion as a holiday gift. Its as if Hoffman is admitting that a fart machine is funnier than this flatulent mess. More fun too. Director Paul Weitz coming off the failures ""Cirque du Freak"" and ""American Dreamz"" never taps into the crude outrageousness that elevates gross-out gags in a Farrelly brothers film. The third film in a comedy series needs to be enriched with life color novelty and vitality but ""Little Fockers"" feels like a focus-grouped jumble from its opening credits to its redundant finale. LITTLE FOCKERS 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for mature sexual humor language drug content. The supporting roles are utterly arbitrary. Harvey Keitel pops in for a brief yell-fest with De Niro Laura Dern plays a couple of inconclusive scenes as the head of a pretentious private kindergarten and Jessica Alba is thrown into the muddle as a sexy drug-company rep whose inexplicable crush on Greg culminates in a belly-flop into a mud pit. Which is essentially the same trajectory as the film. Theres even an appearance by Deepak Chopra who has a pointless 10-second turn as himself. Fans of dreadful entertainment will recall Dr. Chopras earlier cameo in the epic Mike Myers flop ""The Love Guru."" Chopra may be an expert on higher consciousness but take it from me hes no judge of comedy.

"Little Fockers review Rue the day you met the Fockers |       NJ.com comments Little Fockers review Rue the day you met the Fockers Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on December 22 2010 at 800 AM View/Post Comments Glen Wilson Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller in ""Little Fockers."" Gaylord Focker has a problem. A few actually. I mean his first name is ""Gaylord"" Okay? His last name is ""Focker."" And hes a male nurse which - to his hypermasculine father-in-law to be - signals all kinds of girly-man cliches. Laughing hysterically yet? Neither was I a decade ago when ""Meet the Parents"" premiered a movie which tiresomely tried to get endless smiles out of various people saying the word ""Focker."" Still the movie had a good cast with Ben Stiller channeling his Comedy of Discomfort from ""Theres Something About Mary"" and Robert De Niro being well Robert De Niro. The inevitable sequel 2004s ""Meet the Fockers"" managed to squeeze a few more small laughs out of this thin premise by adding Barbra Streisand and the forever game Dustin Hoffman as Stillers parents. Movie Review Littler Fockers (PG-13) Universal (97 min.) Directed by Paul Weitz. With Ben Stiller Robert De Niro Jessica Alba. Now playing in New Jersey.Rating note The film contains crude humor strong language and supposedly comic violence. Stephen Whittys Review ONE AND A HALF STARS By now you would think the concept had run its course. Youd be right too. But there is still money to be made possibly and for its stars still fat checks to be cashed. So now we get ""Little Fockers"" which has no other reason for being -- and not a single laugh in its 97 minutes. Despite the title the movie has very little to do with the Focker children (which is just as well as theyre two of the least personable movie moppets in a long time). Instead were back to the old grind with De Niro looking suspiciously at Stiller Stiller flailing around awkwardly both their wives smiling patiently and perfect Owen Wilson waiting in the wings. None of it is very funny and the attempts to add new material smell strongly of desperation. Hoffman and Streisand are brought back for example but for no good reason -- and in scenes that are so obviously the product of rewrites and reshoots they dont mesh with the rest of the film. Glen WilsonTwins Samantha (Daily Tahan) and Henry (Colin Baiocchi) give their grandma Roz (Barbra Streisand a Focker sandwich in the third installment of the blockbuster series. And that comedy stylist Jessica Alba makes an appearance too this time as a kittenish peddler of erectile dysfunction drugs who immediately crushes on Stiller big-time. Of course -- who wouldnt? Apart from you know any woman on earth who looked remotely like Jessica Alba. The ""jokes"" begin with an enema scene and the gags - and I mean that literally - soon grow to include material on projectile vomit intestinal gas and De Niros own painful priapic erection. Actual humor however is in very short supply. The movie is so starved for ideas in fact that it promisingly reunites De Niro with his old partner in crime Harvey Keitel - and then cant come up with anything for the two of them to do except stand around in a backyard and argue about how to fill up a gaping hole. Ive got an idea for them. Bury this thing.

"Little Fockers doesnt inherit enough laughs from Parents - USATODAY.com Cars  Auto Financing  Event Tickets  Jobs  Real Estate  Online Degrees Shopping SearchHow do I find it?Subscribe to paper Home News Travel Money Sports Life Tech Weather Life >> Movies Box Office Report Movie Listings Awards Central Shop for Movies/DVDs Little Fockers doesnt inherit enough laughs from Parents Updated  | Comment  | Recommend E-mail | Print | Enlarge By Glen Wilson Universal Studios Focker gets a fright Henry (Colin Baiocchi) one of Greg and Pams twins. ABOUT THE MOVIELittle Fockers  (out of four)Stars Robert De Niro Ben Stiller Teri Polo Dustin Hoffman Barbra Streisand Blythe Danner Owen Wilson Jessica AlbaDirector Paul WeitzDistributor Universal PicturesRating PG-13 for mature sexual humor language and some drug contentRunning time 1 hour 38 minutesOpens Wednesday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Despite the title marginally clever as it is Little Fockers is mostly about the adult members of the unfortunately named clan. And like its predecessors Meet the Parents and Meet the Fockers it revolves around the contest of wills between the hapless Gaylord Focker (Ben Stiller) and his fearsome father-in-law Jack Byrnes (Robert De Niro). It was a comical enough conceit a decade ago. The 2004 sequel featured sporadically loopy turns by the iconic Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman as Stillers parents. In this third installment the effort is wearing thin. It takes too long for the story to take off and even longer for the comedy to kick in. Unless projectile vomit and penile injections are your idea of comedy supreme the intended humor is spotty at best. INTERVIEW Stiller De Niro work hard for the funny TRAILER Get to know Little Fockers When you have such heavyweights as De Niro Blythe Danner Hoffman and Streisand on hand why waste the audiences time with kids dinner table queries about defecation? The rationalization is simple enough. ""We have to laugh at stuff that makes us human"" one of the characters points out. True enough but must we be forced to find humor in that which merely makes us queasy? Gaylord aka Greg and his wife Pam (Teri Polo) now have young twins. One of the funnier gags involves the kids interview at the ridiculously progressive Early Human School where the smarmy headmistress (Laura Dern) mistakes Jack and Greg for a gay couple. Greg faces temptation in the form of Jessica Alba who plays the bubbly pharmaceutical rep Andi Garcia. The repeated confusion between her name and that of the actor is a funny note wringing more laughs than Gregs decision to promote a newfangled version of Viagra one that is safe enough for heart patients. It turns out Jack has had a heart attack while alone in the house but being a tough former CIA operative he manages to keep it on the down low. As a gesture of trust he confides in Greg and promises hell inherit Jacks patriarchal mantle dubbing him ""The Godfocker."" Jacks once-favorite son-in-law ""Dr. Bob"" (Tom McCarthy) has left his wife so Jack is keeping his eyes trained on Greg to be sure he still finds his daughter sexually attractive. We knew he was a nut but a man checking on his son-in-laws libido seems way beyond intrusive. When he begins tailing Greg and enlists his granddaughter to spy on her parents his omniscient bravado looks increasingly deranged but not very funny. Keeping the home fires stoked is a major theme. Theres an awkward gag in which Jack and his wife Dina (Danner) watch therapist Roz Fockers TV show Sexpress Yourself and indulge in her recommended dalliances. Meanwhile Bernie Focker (Hoffman) expresses his newfound passion for flamenco dancing in Sevilla. Maybe all this suggestive folderol would work better in a foreign language. The actors here look as uncomfortable as we feel watching them. Four writers are credited with the screenplay which could explain the uneven humor. A concluding scene sets things up for a fourth movie hinting that the in-laws will become an even more meddlesome force. There are viable flashes of comedy in the franchise. But with each movie they grow increasingly dim. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Standards Editor Brent Jones.

The test of wills between Greg Focker (Ben Stiller left) and father-in-law Jack Byrnes (Robert De Niro) goes on in the third film about the Focker clan. Photo Glen Wilson Little Fockers 1 / 1 Back to Gallery If youve seen one youve seen em all. And thats the best I can say for Little Fockers a semi-painful semi-amusing sequel that reunites the battling in-laws from Meet the Parents and its follow-up Meet the Fockers. In the original Ben Stiller played Greg Focker a nice neurotic male nurse who submitted to lie-detector tests by Jack his girlfriends father -- an ex-spy played by Robert De Niro in squinting-psycho mode. In the second movie her parents met his parents generating loudmouth flakiness and one repulsive bowl of fondue. As the third film opens we find the afflicted Greg Focker and his now-wife Pam (Teri Polo) enjoying life with 5-year-old twins. Greg seems to be getting along with his kooky father-in-law. Pams airily obsessive ex-beau Kevin (Owen Wilson) seems to be engaged to some babe named Svetlana. Everything seems to be fine which means that everything is about to disintegrate. Sure enough Jack has a heart attack. After defibrillating himself with his polygraph machine he pressures Greg to assume more responsibility as pater familias. ""The Godfocker"" Jack calls him cuing Nino Rota knockoff music on the soundtrack. Then Jessica Alba arrives - as Andi Garcia (yep) an overeager pharmaceutical rep (yep) hawking a Viagra-like pill for heart patients (yep). I dont need to tell you what happens. Probably you infer some funny business involving the erectile drug. Likely as not you suspect some attraction between Greg and Andi or more to the point you suspect that Jack suspects some attraction between Greg and Andi. Probably you dont expect an enema-insertion scene near the start but there it is. Despite the title Little Fockers has less to do with the littlest Fockers than the clans developmentally stunted grown-ups all of them behaving exactly as theyve behaved in movies past. Greg is a dipstick. Jack is a nut. The women (including Blythe Danner as Pams mom) are sane but inconsequential forced to sit out most of the nonsense. Everyones a little older and a little more frayed around the edges as though theyve been through this carp-and-whine-with-gay-jokes routine too many times. Some of it induces laughter some squirms. This is the first Focker installment not directed by Jay Roach who did a good job balancing the yuks with the more outrageous gross-outs. That comic-revolting parity shouldnt be much of a challenge for American Pies Paul Weitz and yet the skeevier bits arent especially funny. Theyre just ... ick. A scene featuring a shot of adrenaline and a pronounced masculine medical emergency almost made me crawl under my seat . Looping in and out of the plot are Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand as Gregs hippie parents their genial personalities and uncomplicated late-life horniness throwing a bit of a sunshine on the gloom. ""We have to laugh at the stuff that makes us human"" says Hoffmans character in reference to boogers.

Played with fierce decorum by Robert De Niro the ex-CIA hardcase Jack Byrnes leveled loaded questions that backpedaled Greg into blurting things like ""You can milk just about anything with nipples.""Stiller with a fully intact returning cast proves that he can even milk a premise. The third installment of the Focker franchise Little Fockers plays out during the build-up to the fifth birthday party for the now-long-married Pam and Gregs titular twins integral to the movie only as pawns in the grown-up games. Jack having gotten a glimpse of his own mortality has reconciled himself to accepting Greg as the familys ""next-in-line"" head. From the outset the once-besieged menschs long struggle to establish his manhood seems nearly won. This detente lasts about as long as it takes Greg and Jack to sit down together at a dining room table an environment fraught with hazard in all Focker films.The elder Fockers Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisands New Age Jews Roz and Bernie are mercifully on the sidelines for much of Little Fockers. But adding to Gregs stress is the appearance of Andi Garcia (Jessica Alba) an aggressively perky flirtatious pharmaceuticals flack who wants him to be the face of a new boner pill. This comic rifle-on-the-wall goes off when Jack his suspicions aroused sneaks a ""Sustengo"" from a sample case for a pajama-tent sight gag and an ""If you experience an erection lasting more than four hours"" panic scene that has lost none of its impact since it appeared in I Think I Love My Wife three years ago.Andi might pose a serious menace to the sanctity of the nuclear family were it not for the fact that shes one of those farcically unbalanced twentysomething party sluts that the world outside of matrimony is full of according to American screen comedies. Challenging the Fockers fidelity from the other side is Pams multi-millionaire mystic ex-fiance Kevin (Owen Wilson still hoarding the best lines). But he too poses no real threat since the character of Pam (Teri Polo) has never had much existence of her own--she spends a goodly portion of Little Fockers quarantined in sickbed and its doubtful anyone would notice if she didnt come back so focused is Fockers on the relationship between Greg and Jack. A scene where the two are confused for gay partners when scouting a posh ""Early Human"" kindergarten lets surface the subtext that has run through the Fockers trilogy.Ghosts of New Hollywood haunt Little Fockers which in addition to featuring De Niro Streisand Hoffman and Harvey Keitel in a throwaway appearance as a contractor includes more or less explicit references to The French Connection The Godfather and Jaws--which are neither funny nor apposite but evidently thought to be Boomer-recognizable. Another interesting note to students of cinematic Decline and Fall are the sops to the younger audience including Google and YouTube punchlines. When television appeared mainstream American film comedies treated the upstart competition as a target for contempt and fun--here a closing-credits gag nails the ""Slap Chop Rap"" somebody probably forwarded you a year ago as Fockers wheezes to catch up with meme faddism.""We have to laugh at the stuff that makes us human"" explains Bernie Focker in the last reel. (SPOILER Everybody learns to get along and family supersedes horrifying personality disorders.) Bernies list includes expelling gas--and presumably the rest of the films mildly desperate scrambling for bits the lasagna-chunked vomit the clumsy sexual slapstick and a little of the old-school ethnic rivalry stuff that carried the last Fockers romp. (Jack tracing the family tree notes Gregs preponderance of ""Wandering peddlers and nameless peasants."") Game performances and a couple of half-laughs sure but this is the screen comedy equivalent of the televised Yule log.

Share Tweet Its helpful to remember that Meet The Parents was a sound idea for a comedy turning the common anxiety of meeting future in-laws into a reasonably entertaining relatable mix of cringe-humor and slapstick. The sequel Meet The Fockers strained the concept to a thin broth but at least introduced another set of in-laws. Now that everyone has met Little Fockers the abysmal second sequel literally has nowhere to go but up some poor guys ass. Barely 10 minutes have elapsed before Ben Stiller still a male nurse (snicker snicker) and Jessica Alba a flirtatious pharmaceutical saleswoman are working an enema tube in some disgusting dance of seduction. From there the film piles on erectile-dysfunction jokes blood vomit farts--anything to keep this zombie franchise within the general realm of mainstream comedy. After terrorizing and later bonding with Stiller in the first Meet The Parents then terrorizing and later bonding with him in the second Robert De Niro is back to his old suspicious self in Little Fockers terrorizing Stiller and--spoiler alert--bonding with him again. Recent heart troubles have De Niro fretting about what will become of his familys legacy after hes dead and he wonders if Stiller is up to the role of patriarch (a.k.a. ""The Godfocker""). On the eve of their twins fifth birthday party Stiller and his wife (Teri Polo) are trying to get the kids into a fancy private school while Stiller fends off his wifes perfect ex-boyfriend (Owen Wilson) who still carries a torch for her. When Alba makes a play for Stiller De Niro gets the wrong idea and suggests a ""course correction"" for his daughter. Giving Wilson an expanded role in Little Fockers is the one good idea the movie has Hes done a dozen iterations on his serenely vacuous pretty-boy character but he at least stays above the fray. The rest of the cast either absorbs or propagates various indignities like an extended sequence involving Stiller De Niro and an erection lasting longer than four hours. Old gags and situations from the previous two films are recycled at will as if they never happened and the whole enterprise feels exhausted and sad like a performer too popular to be allowed a graceful retirement. When the conclusion leaves the door open for still another sequel it feels like an invitation to a living wake.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Is there a statute of limitations for how many good actors can be wasted in a bad movie? Antic and only fitfully amusing ""Little Fockers is the multiplex equivalent of a cash grab -- its a three-quel what did you expect? -- but that only makes the quality of talent involved more than routinely depressing.Yes theres Robert De Niro once more playing ex-CIA agent Jack Byrnes paranoid ramrod father-in-law to male nurse Greg Focker (Ben Stiller). The ever-underutilized Blythe Danner is his wife again and as Gregs parents Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman dash through at the beginning and end spritzing happily because theyre not on the hook for the entire film. Hoffman who spends his first scene learning to flamenco in Seville looks fit tan rested and ready. Unfortunately hes ready for a different movie.Teri Polo returns as Gregs wife Pam and Owen Wilson as her ex-boyfriend Kevin the latter mellow and perfect and weirdly neurotic. New players include Jessica Alba as a pharmaceutical rep with the hots for Greg and Laura Dern as the mealy-mouthed principal of a private kindergarten. Sadly director Paul Weitz (""American Pie ""About a Boy) and writers John Hamburg and Larry Stuckey have no idea what to do with either actress. Alba overacts frenetically -- its like she has to pee really badly in every one of her scenes -- and Derns plotline just disappears midway through. Too bad; her characters administrative K-12 doubletalk (""No two early humans are alike) is the funniest part of the movie.Otherwise the humor goes below the belt early and often. ""Little Fockers features an extended enema gag and a box of musical condoms -- and thats just the first five minutes. Much is made of an erectile dysfunction medicine called ""Sustengo and the movies comic high/low point comes when Greg has to inject his father-in-law in the privates with an Epi-Pen. Try explaining that to the kids.Thats one of the few scenes that goes so far into bad taste as to be genuinely uproarious; otherwise the jokes get halfway there and wimp out with a crude little splat. The original ""Meet the Parents was a comedy of emasculation that didnt match its obvious model ""Theres Something About Mary but that came close enough for the studio bean-counters. True to its title ""Little Fockers feels like the movies hyperactive grandkid picking up and putting down various plotlines until you want to send it off for a long nap.For moviegoers who were around in the 1970s heres the saddest part Harvey Keitel shows up in the small role of Gregs house contractor and gets a one-scene face-off with De Niros Jack. The two men circle each other for a few seconds like pitbulls descended from Brando and then its over before it begins. ""Little Fockers is the sixth movie the actors have appeared in together and its easily the laziest and least; what started with ""Mean Streets and ""Taxi Driver has come down to . . . this. They should have just brought in Pacino and called it ""Mother Fockers. Note to the producers Im kidding.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. To follow him go to www.twitter.com/tyburr.

"Little Fockers An immature follow-up to the Parents franchise washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On >> This StoryRead +| Comments Little Fockers An immature follow-up to the Parents franchise GalleryAnn Hornadays Best Films of 2010There are great years in movies and bad years in movies and by all accounts 2010 has been ... pretty good. As often happens when looking at the films that opened over the past several months it wasnt difficult to come up with a list of the ten best. If anything in a year that included such stand-outs as ""Rabbit Hole"" ""True Grit"" ""The Kings Speech"" ""Black Swan"" ""Get Low"" ""The Fighter"" and ""Toy Story 3"" it was difficult choosing what to leave off. These are my ten best films of 2010>> LAUNCH PHOTO GALLERY Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Sean OConnell Special to the Washington Post Tuesday December 21 2010; 609 PM We must have been pretty naughty this year for Santa to stuff a lump of coal like ""Little Fockers"" into our cinematic stockings. This StoryLittle Fockers An immature follow-up to the Parents franchiseVideo Little Fockers trailerWashington Post cinema guideHoliday movie guideView All Items in This StoryView Only Top Items in This Story How bad is the third installment of the ""Meet the Parents"" franchise? So bad it makes the perfectly ordinary ""Meet the Fockers"" look Oscar-worthy. So bad the Hollywood Foreign Press Association should nominate it for a musical/comedy Golden Globe. So bad that this bland pointless sequel features a gratuitous scene where the stunning Jessica Alba - one of many new faces added to an already overstuffed ensemble - strips down to her lacy undergarments belly-flops into a backyard pit rolls around in the mud and I still cant recommend you pay to see it. The reservoir that Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro previously dipped into when hoping to replenish their 10-year-old franchise has run dry. What remains once the bottom of the creative barrel has been scraped are awkward rectal-examination jokes random celebrity cameos meant to distract from the sitcom-level scripting and hackneyed relationship quarrels that were addressed (and I thought resolved) in the first two films. Thats right Gaylord Focker (Stiller) still cant catch a break with his skeptical father-in-law Jack Byrnes (De Niro) despite the fact that Gay - ahem Greg - has been married to Pam Focker (Teri Polo) for nearly a decade now and has helped raise happily bratty twins. But Pam is beginning to inherit some of her dads suspicions particularly now that Greg is working closely with beautiful pharmaceutical sales rep Andi Garcia (Alba) to peddle Sustengo an erectile dysfunction pill. But the prospect of infidelity is hardly the only issue challenging these ""Little Fockers."" Theres actually a laundry list of inconsequential plot developments were asked to labor through in 98 interminable minutes. Jack who now suffers from serious heart palpitations is obsessed with finding a successor to his ""throne."" Greg and Pam meanwhile arent sure if their new suburban abode will be finished in time for the twins outdoor birthday party. Bernie Focker (Dustin Hoffman) struck with a bout of ""manopause"" has fled to Spain to study flamenco dancing while Dina Byrnes (Blythe Danner) is experimenting with kinky role play in hopes of spicing up her and Jacks sex life. Somewhere in the midst of this chaos Greg has to impress the headmaster of a snooty private school (Laura Dern) where he wants his children to go. Seriously when did the ""Parents"" franchise morph into a daytime soap opera? The infamous circle of trust once considered an exclusive bond has been stretched and pulled to encompass so many tertiary characters and meaningless subplots that it now rests limply at the feet of its stars like a rope of taffy. And director Paul Weitz (""American Pie"") who takes over the reins from former ""Fockers"" guide Jay Roach isnt clever or resourceful enough to tighten the slack. One or two cast members help when they can. Watch Owen Wilson ignore the nonsense hes been handed in the screenplay and wander knowingly into funnier territories. Lets scrap the next few ""Fockers"" sequels and get Wilsons spiritual guru character Kevin a spinoff. Because when Wilsons not around we get Alba Dern and Harvey Keitel who all need well-written jokes if theyre going to be funny. The fact that De Niro and Keitel legends of the cinema are reduced to trading weak-kneed insults in a watered-down sequel like this is a shame. Mostly ""Little Fockers"" trots out contrived comedic scenes that limp along without energy or rhythm until Weitz ends them abruptly with head-scratchingly bizarre one-liners or disgusting sight gags. Stiller gets puked on by his son. Stiller again slices his finger open with a carving knife and sprays his family with blood. And the piece de resistance which has to be Stiller administering a shot of adrenaline into De Niros medically enhanced erection. How is it possible that Im more embarrassed for De Niro than he seems to be for himself? OConnell is a freelance writer. Little Fockers r (98 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for mature sexual humor throughout language and some drug content. >> This StoryRead +| Comments (c) 2010 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity Most Popular Twitter Activity Follow The Post Facebook Twitter View More Activity  Little Fockers An immature follow-up to the Parents franchise Video Little Fockers trailer Washington Post cinema guide Holiday movie guide",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/21/AR2010122104764.html,200,littlefockers19,littlefockers,washingtonpost

More about Little Fockers >> Starring Ben Stiller as the Jewish son-in-law who fails to meet the unreasonable expectations of his gentile father-in-law (Robert De Niro) Little Fockers third in the series that began with Meet the Parents comes to bury grudges and inevitably raises them instead. The best that can be said of the overpopulated and underwritten film is that it gives in-laws spouses and spawn a place to put their holiday anxiety and laugh at it. But the humor is sporadic with Viagra jokes that dont provoke laughs so much as cringes. The situations are so broad as to make those of Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner look realistic. When Jack Byrnes (De Niro) a retired CIA agent experiences medical troubles he turns to Greg (Stiller) a nurse rather than to ""Dr. Bob"" his other son-in-law an M.D. A philanderer Dr. Bob is about to be booted from Jacks ""circle of trust."" At the beginning of the movie Greg is in an unfamiliar place his father-in-laws good graces. Worried about his health Jack begins to devise a family succession plan. Is Greg man enough and responsible enough to succeed Jack as the family patriarch? Enter Andi Garcia (Jessica Alba) vixenish Viagra rep who wants ""Nurse Greg"" to endorse her companys new product an erectile-dysfunction drug with beneficial effects for cardiac patients. Andi flirts shamelessly with Greg. Suspicious Jack worries that he has another unreliable son-in-law on his hands. To Jacks mind this might not be such a bad thing because if Greg is out of the way Jacks daughter Pam (Teri Polo) can get back together with her old beau Kevin (Owen Wilson) the Zenned-out millionaire who still carries a torch for her. Some directors throw money at the screen to patch up plotholes. Filmmaker Paul Weitz taking over for Jay Roach throws stars. Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman are back as Gregs parents. Blythe Danner returns as Jacks unusually loosey-goosey spouse. Harvey Keitel has a cameo as a contractor Laura Dern as a principal of an elite school. And is that Deepak Chopra as Kevins guru? The million-dollar cast doesnt make the vulgar penny-ante jokes any funnier. Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

They bring tidings of erectile-dysfunction humor projectile vomit and wacky mix-ups right out of a Threes Company rerun. Even the name Little Fockers is best said with a juvenile chuckle. Fockers. Heh-heh. In all fairness a more accurate title - say Ben Stiller Conveys Abject Humiliation as Robert De Niro Cashes Another Paycheck - would stretch the capacity of most marquees.So whats in store for the Fockers this time out? Stillers Gabe Focker is still out to impress his poppa-in-law Jack Byrnes (De Niro). Gregs wife Pam Focker (Teri Polo) doesnt have much of anything to do for which she should be thankful. And their kids the little Fockers? They have even less to do but without them a title change would be in order and we cant have that can we?Round and round we go where we stop nobody knows - until the next installment in the sagging Meet the Parents franchise. This one the third in the series shows signs of battle fatigue from the moment Stiller breaks out his first pangs of middle-class aspirational anxiety. You see hypochondriac former CIA agent Jack thinks his heart could give out any minute and hes still not sure about that Jewish kid his daughter married. Gregs zany parents (Dustin Hoffman admirably game and Barbra Streisand) are back as well for some bonus kvetching.If thats not tough enough Gregs rival his wifes ex (Owen Wilson) is still waxing on about his idol JC (thats Jesus Christ) and looming in the background. Meanwhile a hottie pharmaceutical rep (Jessica Alba) has talked Greg into pitching Sustengo a sideline he must hide for the purpose of preserving the thin deceptions on which such comedies thrive. You see Jack thinks Greg is sleeping with the hottie Crazy man. The patriarch also ends up popping a few pills from Gregs supply because you know epic erections are really funny.Nobody gets out of Meet the Fockers looking particularly good. Somewhere beneath the high jinks may lurk something funny about the stresses and demands of modern family life and keeping up with the Joneses; the best laughs come courtesy of an elite kindergarten called the Early Human School where the big Fockers hope to send the little Fockers.Otherwise Little Fockers packs in all the cynicism and laziness of a tired franchises third chapter. Its the drive-through version of comfort food comedy by repetition and indigestion. The parents have been met; the Fockers have paid their dues.

"Maybe more of the little Fockers would have helped the film - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Maybe more of the little Fockers would have helped the filmLittle Fockers a 1 1/2 starsDecember 21 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticThe strangely marginalized little Fockers in ""Little Fockers"" are played by Daisy Tahan of ""Nurse Jackie"" and Colin Baiocchi who appeared in ""Couples Retreat"" and who clearly cant get a break when it comes to big-screen ensemble work with anything like a shelf life. Im not worried about the kids income; Im concerned that hes growing up on film sets more dedicated to star maintenance than decent situation comedy.These little Fockers despite the title (""Little Fockers"") remain sidelined in what passes for the comic complications of this third film in an extremely profitable series begun with a pretty good picture ""Meet the Parents."" The sole memorable scene involving a little Focker in ""Little Fockers"" though memorable doesnt mean amusing involves Ben Stillers male-nurse character administering a needle full of adrenaline to his dyspeptic and unhappily aroused father-in-law Jack Byrnes played by Robert De Niro who has taken an overdose of a Viagra-like pills and in goes the needle and theres the preteen boy at the bathroom door suddenly not quite sure of whats going on between his father and grandfather and everybody screams in a comical way (thats the intent at least) and the whole thing feels slightly...off. PG-13 yucky but yucky all the same.The old gangs back dutifully including Teri Polo (marginalized no less than her little Fockers) as Greg Fockers generic wife Pam; Blythe Danner as Jacks wife Dina all patience and understanding; Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand as Bernie and Roz Focker the former a late-blooming flamenco enthusiast the latter a host of a sex-therapy TV show embarrassing her son on-air and in-person; and Owen Wilson as the super-rich ex-lover of Pam whose suburban Chicago mansion provides the locale for the climactic birthday party which devolves into a slapstick melee between Focker and his father-in-law.De Niro suffers most of the head-banging indignities in ""Little Fockers."" The more he throws himself into the reaction shots and the mugging the more you wonder if hes really having a good time with this desperate material. Jessica Alba plays a minxy drug rep who tempts Stillers character but alls well in the end though the preview audience didnt laugh much at least audibly -- does pretend-laughing count? On second thought ""alls well"" doesnt apply to this sequel in any particular. Paul Weitz directed in a style flatter and more obvious than films such as ""About a Boy"" (co-directed with his brother Chris) and ""In Good Company"" would indicate.mjphillipstribune.comMPAA rating PG-13 (for mature sexual humor throughout language and some drug content)Cast Ben Stiller (Greg Focker); Robert De Niro (Jack Byrnes); Owen Wilson (Kevin); Teri Polo (Pam); Blythe Danner (Dina); Dustin Hoffman (Bernie); Barbra Streisand (Roz); Jessica Alba (Andi); Laura Dern (Prudence); Harvey Keitel (Randy); Daisy Tahan (Samantha); Colin Baiocchi (Henry)Credits Directed by Paul Weitz; written by John Hamburg Larry Stuckey and Victoria Strouse; produced by Jane Rosenthal Robert De Niro Jay Roach and John Hamburg.

Little Fockers (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Little Fockers (PG-13) The third installment of the hit comedy franchise is a crass cash grab Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald12/21/2010 Editor rating 1 Sitting through Little Fockers is a soul-sucking excruciating experience. A sequel to 2004s Meet the Fockers was probably inevitable since it became the highest-grossing comedy of all time even though it wasnt nearly as funny as the first chapter in the trilogy Meet the Parents which still holds up. So OK fine Little Fockers Hollywood is a business after all and only a sucker wouldnt try to squeeze more dough out of a franchise that is beloved the world over. But couldnt they have tried? At least just a little? This lazy shapeless humor-free picture which was directed by Paul Weitz who is capable of good character-driven comedies (About a Boy In Good Company) and written by John Hamburg (I Love You Man) and Larry Stuckey is agonizing to sit through. Watching talented actors coast through familiar routines for the sake of a paycheck is dispiriting It makes you feel like youve been had. Little Fockers is one of the crassest cash-grabs I have ever seen - the laziness leaves you embarrassed for the people onscreen. The movie is built upon the flimsiest premise imaginable yet another scenario in which a character inexplicably lies about something instead of telling the simple truth which would have saved everyone a lot of grief (and spared us from having to endure the film). Instead Greg (Ben Stiller) decidesnot to tell his family about a presentation hes making at a pharmaceutical convention because he doesnt want his father-in-law Jack (Robert De Niro) to know hes hurting for money. This leads to suspicions of adultery with a vivacious saleswoman (Jessica Alba giving the best performance in the film which should tell you something) much snooping and skullduggery a tired Viagra joke and such bottom-of-the-barrel gags as Gregs adorable 5-year-old son projectile vomiting in his dads face. Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand reprise their roles as Gregs parents in what can be described as extended cameos. Hoffman is forced to act like such a complete buffoon having run off to Spain to take flamenco lessons that you grow to loathe his carefree go-with-the-flow demeanor. Hes not funny hes just an idiot. Harvey Keitel shows up as a construction worker who gets to go toe-to-toe with De Niro in one scene which only reminds you what a great film Mean Streets was and wonder why you didnt stay home and watch that again instead. The title of Little Fockers implies the couples twins are going to play a major role in the film but the kids serve barely any function in the film. Owen Wilson reprises his bit as the do-no-wrong golden boy but what was amusing in the first film has now been exaggerated to the level of a bad SNL skit. By the end of Little Fockers Greg and Jack finally engage in an extended fistfight further proof of how wrong-headed the entire enterprise is. You dont want to see these two characters beat each other up in public the constant and suppressed tension between them is what made Meet the Parents funny. I have no idea how Little Fockers will fare at the box office but I am hoping it doesnt gross enough to warrant a fourth film. Life is short you know? Please no more focking Fockers.

(AP Photo/Universal Pictures Glen Wilson) Fockers All-star cast cant save Little Fockers BY JOE WILLIAMS  Post-Dispatch Film Critic gt; joewilliamspost-dispatch.com gt; 314-340-8344 Dec 21 2010 (...) Glen Wilson A scene from ""Little Fockers."" (AP Photo/Universal Pictures Glen Wilson) ""Little Fockers"" is more than a little disappointing. Despite the distasteful title this second sequel to the genuinely funny ""Meet the Parents"" is not primarily about the toddler twins of nebbishy nurse Greg Focker (Ben Stiller). Nor is it about his oversexed parents (Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman who are barely in the movie at all) his CIA-agent father-in-law (Robert De Niro who ought to make the screenwriters a little bit spooked) or his misinterpreted tryst with a foxy pharmaceutical rep (Jessica Alba who almost steals the film while the heavyweights are loafing). Its about squeezing the last few dollars from a gullible public like milk from a cat.We should be skeptical of any movie that starts with a harried doctor/lawyer/decorator racing down a hallway while a secretary recites the days agenda. Today nurse Fockers first duty is doody - inducing a bowel movement from an uptight patient. Sales rep Andi Garcia (Alba) gushes about Gregs technique and offers him a job promoting her companys new impotence drug. When father-in-law Frank Byrnes (De Niro) catches wind of their rendezvous he initially thinks Greg is having an affair with actor Andy Garcia. Slapstick surveillance ensues. Meanwhile theres a dead-end subplot about Greg and wife Pam (Teri Polo) trying to get their twins into a high-end preschool run by an obnoxious phony (Laura Dern) a wasted opportunity involving an ornery landscaper (De Niros ""Mean Streets"" co-star Harvey Keitel) and a pointless visit from Pams wealthy whiny ex-boyfriend (Owen Wilson). Its as if the casting agent invited a team of Hollywood all-stars to a charades party and then forgot to give them a clue. But if instead of story and characters your movie wish list includes projectile vomiting and erection gags this lump of coal has your name on it.

"Little Fockers | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; little-fockers ) Little Fockers (United States 2010) December 20 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Watching Little Fockers is a depressing experience. Rarely does a comedy bring such an overpowering sense of sadness. Admittedly I laughed a few times and am willing to admit that the experience as a whole was more bearable than the trial of sitting through Meet the Fockers but that doesnt alleviate my fundamental reaction this is perhaps the most dispiriting motion picture of the holiday season. Its all about Robert De Niro. Once in what seems to have been another lifetime De Niro was considered by many to be the greatest living actor. That was before he started dabbling in comedy. It didnt take long for the novelty value to wear off. Now like Leslie Nielsen he has become impossible to take seriously. With this years Stone it appeared there might yet be hope for De Niro to return to acting. Little Fockers has shattered that hope. In many ways it represents a new low for De Niro a level of embarrassment to which I never thought I would see him sink. Watching his third outing as lunatic father Jack Byrnes I embraced the reality that the De Niro of Taxi Driver Raging Bull and Goodfellas is dead. All we have left is this bloated self-parody. Talk about a harsh dose of reality. (De Niro it should be noted is complicit in the immolation of his image - hes listed as a producer as he was for Meet the Parents and Meet the Fockers.) Little Fockers continues the saga of Greg Focker (Ben Stiller); his wife Pam (Teri Polo reduced to a glorified cameo); and his father-in-law from hell Jack (De Niro). Also returning for this installment are Pams old flame Kevin (Owen Wilson less funny here than in James L. Brooks How Do You Know); Jacks wife Dina (Blythe Danner); and Gregs parents Bernie (Dustin Hoffman appearing in only a few scenes) and Roz (Barbra Streisand with less screen time than Hoffman). New to the Focker universe is drug company representative Andi Garcia (Jessica Alba) who is hawking an erectile dysfunction drug called ""Sustengo."" The (thin) storyline focuses on Jacks decision that Greg will become the ""Godfocker"" - the patriarch of the next generation of Byrnes and Fockers. In order for Greg to hold that title however Jack has to deem him worthy and that requires spying and background checks. Some of the things Jack uncovers like Gregs apparent dalliance with Andi stoke his anger and the simmering hostility between Jack and Greg explodes into all-out war. Director Paul Weitz replacing Jay Roach culls the most humor he can from the situations but anyone expecting start-to-finish laughter will be disappointed. No matter what your taste in humor whether its low-brow bodily fluid material or somewhat more sophisticated jokes theres something here to touch the funny bone - but dont expect too much of it. The person who chortles at De Niros 5 1/2-hour erection probably isnt going to be as amused by the Jaws parody. The hit-and-miss comedy comes in service of an inane plot with zero character development. The real problem with Little Fockers is that most of the humor found in these circumstances was explored in the first movie Meet the Parents including the closeness of the name ""Focker"" to a profane word. Meet the Fockers re-hashed these things and Little Fockers is going for the hat trick. The only new element is Jessica Alba but aside from providing some eye candy (she has an underwear scene) she doesnt add more beyond a vacuous smile and a chirpy demeanor. Theres not a lot to say about Little Fockers. It is what it is. Its comfort food for the masses - an unthreatening comedy with familiar faces doing pretty much the same things they have done in two previous excursions. Despite numerous sexual references and double entendres its not too graphic to be deemed unsuitable for older children and is at least occasionally amusing. Theres no reason for this movie to exist except that its predecessors made a lot of money. By churning out this third installment Universal is guaranteed at least a modest return on their investment (and perhaps better than that) and everyone involved stands to collect a nice check. Its a winning proposition for all except those increasingly rare movie-goers who crave a daring or original comedy that doesnt feel like a recycled sit-com.

On the set of Little Fockers the third in the comic series that began with 2000s Meet the Parents Stiller probably spent a solid day having a child actors chunky fake vomit sprayed on his face repeatedly. And what do you suppose was less fun the scene with the anal exam (although he wasnt on the receiving end) or the hours spent thrashing around in a bouncy castle with Robert DeNiro in order to capture the verisimilitude of in-law rage? (See TIMEs Top 10 movies of 2010.) For Stiller coming off a strong performance in the yucky but smart Greenberg the yucky and not smart Little Fockers was less a sacrifice for art than for money. The movie directed by Paul Weitz and featuring such surprises as Owen Wilson kissing Barbra Streisand and Jessica Alba being kind of funny is being positioned as the closest thing to a cinematic sure bet this Christmas weekend. The franchise is tired and the situations are forced but Universal is banking on the belief that people will still want to see Stillers Gaylord ""Greg"" Focker the consummate American schlemiel. They probably will; as Focker Stiller is adept at making moviegoers feel better about their own lousy lives and challenging in-laws. (See TIMEs 2010 Holiday Movie Preview.) Like the rest of us Greg is under more intense financial pressure than usual these days. His twins Henry (Colin Baiocchi) and surly Samantha (Daisy Tahan) a chip off her grandfathers suspicious fractious former-CIA-agent block are about to turn five -- an age at which yuppie parents thoughts turn to expensive private schooling. The missus Pam (Teri Polo) is a stay-at-home mom. While Greg the oft-ridiculed male nurse has been promoted to an administrative position at his Chicago hospital hes also a new homeowner with a suburban house under extensive and expensive renovation by a shady contractor (Harvey Keitel). Gregs blood relatives are also being more embarrassing than usual his mother Roz (Streisand) has become the host of a successful television sex therapy show where she freely mines Gregs personal life for material and his father Bernie (Dustin Hoffman) has run off to Spain to learn to tango -- a desire Roz ascribes to male menopause (late onset from where we sit). As the movie begins just a couple of weeks before the twins birthday the bright side for Greg is that his gruff father-in-law Jack Byrnes (DeNiro) has finally decided hes not so bad. Jacks ""good"" son-in-law of the earlier movies Dr. Bob (Tom McCarthy) has disgraced himself with infidelity and Jack ruffled by his own heart condition has decided to pass the paternal mantle to Greg. ""Are you prepared to be the GodFocker?"" asks Jack. In Stillers capable hands were reminded again what a good and patient guy Greg is. Hes made friends with Kevin (Wilson) his once-insufferable rival for Pams affections. Hes accepted this difficult relationship with his father-in-law and does his best to accommodate the jerk. When Jack and Pams mother Dina (Blythe Danner) arrive for the birthday festivities Greg roasts a turkey. Its not Thanksgiving but he remembered that Jack likes and appreciates a turkey any day of the year. And hes flattered by his new GodFocker responsibilities. Wait a minute. GodFocker? Theres a reason why Jacks choice of titles is especially ironic but it eluded me far longer than it ought to have. Im afraid the DeNiro of The Godfather Part II and Goodfellas has mostly faded from my mind replaced by the DeNiro of the Fockers -- a grim-faced comedian who tends to make me sad. Hes at the age where he should be considered the elder statesman of American dramas but there he is as grandpa Jack in Little Fockers suffering the lingering effects of a new erectile dysfunction medication for heart patients. Raging bull indeed. But as crass and dumb as Little Fockers is -- it grasps at drama by having Jack discard his new faith in Greg after he gets suspicious of Gregs working relationship with pretty pharmaceutical rep Andi Garcia (Alba) -- there are a few tidbits that work. Alba is charming until her character gets sent to the stupidity factory. A screen visitation from the elusive Streisand is never to be taken lightly even if she doesnt do much. And Laura Derns few scenes as Prudence the headmistress of the Early Human School an exclusive progressive school to which Pam and Greg hope to send the twins are brilliantly on the money. She manages to be cloying cutting and New Age at the same time. In the all-too-likely event of a fourth Focker film lets hope Henry and Samantha get in.

Nonstop in-law animosity would seem to have exhausted its comedic potential with ""Little Fockers"" a lazy attempt to milk a few more laughs and bucks from the enormously lucrative property spawned 10 years ago by ""Meet the Parents."" Good for a few incidental chuckles at best this Paul Weitz-directed romp piles on the strained shenanigans as it pushes Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro toward what one hopes will be a climactic showdown. While some customer loyalty is to be expected the unmistakable whiff of franchise fumes should keep pic out of the high-end neighborhood (279 million domestic) occupied by ""Meet the Fockers."" Whereas the first two films followed the ever well-meaning always frustrated Greg Focker (Stiller) and bride-to-be Pam (Teri Polo) on prenuptial trips to Long Island and Florida ""Little Fockers"" zeroes in on the Chicago-based couple as they approach middle age and deal with the usual challenges related to work finances and the raising of their twin children Samantha (Daisy Tahan) and Henry (Colin Baiocchi). Greg is under considerable pressure to make some extra dough renovate the familys dream home and find a good school for the kids -- all of which is exacerbated of course by the presence of Pams overbearing ex-CIA dad Jack Byrnes (De Niro) who has flown in with sweetly long-suffering wife Dina (Blythe Danner) for their grandchildrens birthday party. While the married-with-children angle would seem to offer a wealth of fresh material pic falls back more tiresomely than ever on the persona of its top-billed star continually poking fun at De Niros rich history as an avatar of cinematic aggression. Thus when Jack suffers a heart attack and suspects he may not be long for this world he anoints Greg ""the Godfocker"" charging him with the sacred responsibility of protecting and maintaining the Byrnes family line. Sometime later Harvey Keitel turns up in a wink-wink cameo that exists solely to justify the ostensibly hilarious sight of the two ""Taxi Driver"" nemeses coming to verbal blows. De Niro submits to all this self-referencing nonsense with a straight if scowling face and gamely plays along with one especially dignity-sapping sequence that makes this the second comedy of the season after ""Love amp; Other Drugs"" to feature misuse of an erectile-dysfunction aid. Other gags are simply unpleasant visible from a mile away (its never a good sign when someone has to carve a turkey in one of these movies) and of no consequence in terms of sustaining comic tension. While its Jay Roach-directed predecessors were predicated on meetings between strangers and staged for maximum discomfort awkwardness and anxiety ""Little Fockers"" feels like just another cute kiddie comedy -- packed with fart and vomit jokes that promptly dissipate by the next scene and prone to spouting endless variations on ""Gaylord Focker"" in the absence of bigger laughs. Pic largely jettisons the WASP-Jew culture clash that was a subtext of ""Meet the Parents"" and an explicit dynamic of ""Meet the Fockers"" As Gregs wacky bohemian parents Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand are seen only sporadically although Owen Wilson duly returns as the super-successful golden boy whom Jack still fancies (10 years later?) a better choice of husband for Pam. Script by John Hamburg and Larry Stuckey (replacing Hamburgs regular co-writer Jim Herzfeld)attempts a sincere look at the challenges of raising a family and keeping a marriage healthy especially given the temptations posed by a way-too-flirtatious drug rep (Jessica Alba) at the hospital where Greg works. The softer edge is also attributable to Weitz who before his recent forays into fantasy helmed such serious-minded comedies as ""In Good Company"" and ""About a Boy"" (with brother Chris). Result however simply feels timid unsurprising and conservative-minded in all respects; if we must have ""Little Fockers"" a certain daring out-there quality would not have been unwelcome. Jacks health problems briefly raise the specter of death and at multiple points one wishes the filmmakers had the courage to take these intimations of mortality to their logical conclusion and let the old bastard succumb already franchise longevity be damned. As it is pic ends on a note that all but promises another sequel. Tech credits are standard Los Angeles doing the best it can to double as Chicago. Laura Dern has a welcome walk-on role as the head of an elite private school and perfs overall are well tuned under the circumstances. Amusing end-credits sequence merely underlines the fact that this franchises best days are well behind it.

TWITTER This unsavory hodgepodge is the latest installment in a franchise that has overstayed its welcome. Little Fockers is focking dismal. Clearly nothing but a paycheck project for all concerned this is definitely the least and hopefully the last of a franchise that started amusingly enough a decade ago but has now officially overstayed its welcome. Still this wont stop quite a few folks from parting with some bucks in search of some holiday season yucks the majority of them from jokes that could have originated on mens room walls. The title of this unsavory hodgepodge is misleading in that very little time is spent with the twin sprigs of Greg and Pam Focker. After attention shifted in the second installment Meet the Fockers to the enjoyably hedonistic seniors played by Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand the focus has here reverted to the tension between Ben Stillers distracted male nurse and his intimidating father-in-law Jack played by Robert De Niro who wants Greg to man up to his responsibilities and become the clans ""godfocker."" Providing the distraction for Greg is Jessica Albas Andi Garcia (yes much mileage is made of her name) a hot-to-trot drug company rep who for inexplicable reasons decides that Greg would be the perfect guy to promote Sustengo an erectile disfunction drug. This one plot element not only sets the very low tenor of most of the films gags but also introduces the possibility that Andi might lead Greg astray which she could no doubt accomplish without the help of her product. But the suspense generated by the threat to Gregs fidelity is nothing compared to the breathless excitement created by the momentum leading up to the films climactic event -- the twins fifth birthday party. For this of course all four grandparents must travel to the Focker abode in Chicago with Gregs dad Bernie (Hoffman) needing to come in all the way from Spain where the old lech has taken up flamenco dancing. Gregs filthy rich pal Kevin (Owen Wilson) is rescued from matrimony to a predatory Russian bride to host the birthday event on a grand scale at his estate the only unexpected fruit of which is a little makeout scene between Wilson and Streisand. But lest we forget the pervasive influence of Sustengo it is responsible for no end of lewd remarks as well as for the films big stab at an outrageous setpiece Having visibly acquired the desired results Jack needs quick relief from his condition something only Greg can provide with an injection in the relevant area. And then theyre caught in the act. Anchored by humor of this nature the film will probably be a big favorite in retirement homes and with mainstream audiences of a certain age. But screenwriters John Hamburg and Larry Stuckey have hardly strained themselves trying to come up with fresh gags while director Paul Weitz stepping in for Jay Roach who this time contents himself with a producers credit just keeps pushing haphazardly from one frantic incident to the next. The series veterans know whats expected of them so suffering most from this lack of special care is series newcomer Alba who is made to look foolish as her Andi relentlessly pursues Greg to the brink as if there werent some more suitable guy upon whom she could bestow her favors. Laura Dern shows up briefly in a mocking turn as the director of a New Age-y institution called ""Early Human School.""
