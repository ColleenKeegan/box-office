BOTTOM LINE More Tarantino than Disney with action that might be too intense for young ones CAST Johnny Depp Isla Fisher Ned Beatty Bill Nighy LENGTH 147 Just when you thought youd seen everything here comes ""Chinatown"" the animated version. If President Andrew Jackson can inspire a rock musical and Anna Nicole Smith can become an opera why not turn a 1974 film noir about water rights into a kids movie? Thats what ""Rango"" is though precious few children will get the overall joke let alone the elaborate tributes to Clint Eastwoods spaghetti Westerns and the 1981 punk-action classic ""The Road Warrior."" Parents and film buffs however may be delighted by this work of inspired lunacy which breaks nearly every rule of animated movies. Its hero is not a child but a seemingly adult chameleon (voiced by Johnny Depp) whose life as someones pet ends abruptly when he falls from a car speeding through the Mojave desert. There he discovers the town of Dirt whose talking-animal citizens arent cute and fuzzy but matted and ugly; some are missing teeth and eyes. Even the prettiest girl here is a flat-faced lizard named Beans (Isla Fisher). advertisement | advertise on newsday Our hero reinvents himself as Rango a wandering gunslinger but bravado is of little use against The Mayor (Ned Beatty) a wheelchair-bound tortoise who controls the water supply and Rattlesnake Jake (Bill Nighy) a terrifying assassin with a Gatling-gun tail. The films PG rating comes from some intense action scenes as well as - get this - lots of smoking. Directed and co-written by Gore Verbinski of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise ""Rango"" is overlong and overclever but gets by on manic energy and a fantastic voice cast led by a wonderfully unhinged Depp. VideoRango Oh the kids?

"Rango | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; rango ) Rango (United States 2011) March 05 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli The first animated film from ILM is also the first memorable motion picture of 2011. Also in a break from Hollywoods incessant race to surcharge parents to death by releasing anything bearing the ""family film"" moniker in 3-D Rango is available in 2-D and only in 2-D. Watching this movie unfold may remind viewers why 2-D is not an inferior format. The image pops with clarity and color. Its bright and vivid. And its a lot easier to lose oneself in the world crafted by the filmmakers without the unwelcome and unnecessary accessory of a pair of cheap plastic glasses. Rango is the poster child for those who are anti-3-D and a great reminder that genuine creativity doesnt need a gimmicky crutch to appeal to audiences. Rango is a celebration of the Western. Its a comedy but like Blazing Saddles (although without the R-rated edge) it exposes a deep abiding love for and knowledge of the genre. Working in concert director Gore Verbinski screenwriter John Logan and composer Hans Zimmer have developed a tapestry thats stitched together using references to every great movie to come along during the Westerns heyday. The dialogue incorporates lines (or variations thereof) from the past. Shot selection mimics classic moments. The music utilizes recognizable cues and at times imitates entire themes. All of the Western motifs and clichA(c)s are employed from the showdown at high noon to the lonely tumbleweed being hurried along by a dusty wind. One of the villains the ominous Rattlesnake Jake bears more than a passing resemblance to Western Legend Lee Van Cleef. And The Man With No Name makes a cameo (with Timothy Olyphant doing a passable Clint Eastwood imitation). Although Rangos primary marching orders pertain to Westerns the film occasionally branches out to reference other famous moments. One high octane scene begins with bats replacing gunships to the tune of ""Ride of the Valkyries"" before transforming into a Western version of an ILM touchstone the Death Star trench battle from Star Wars. For older viewers Rango offers dozens of ""spot the reference"" instances to go along with a screenplay thats characterized by a depth and intelligence one rarely finds in non-Pixar animated fare. For younger viewers there are plenty of dizzying action sequences peppering a fast-moving energetic story. Rango (voice of Johnny Depp) is a lizard living in a home aquarium until an accident strands beside a highway in the middle of a desert. Seeking water he strikes out into the forbidding territory and finds Dirt - the town of Dirt that is. Its a miniature version of an Old West frontier settlement for talking animals. Rango fits right in. There are badgers toads owls and possums. The mayor (Ned Beatty) is a turtle. The most fearsome gunslinger is a snake. Rango establishes his reputation as a hero through a combination of bluster and happenstance. In a showdown with a hawk he gets lucky. An accident brings down a disused water tower on top of the bird. However Dirts problems are not solved; as the new sheriff it falls to Rango to discover what has happened to the towns water supply which has dried up leaving fields and mouths equally parched. The voice acting is top-notch with Johnny Depp taking top billing as the occasionally wisecracking Rango. Like Mike Meyers Depp has a chameleon-like voice and is not easily recognizable without his Captain Jack accent. Support comes from an eclectic group that includes Isla Fisher (as Rangos tart-tongued love interest Beans) Abigail Breslin Alfred Molina Ray Winstone Ned Beatty and Bill Nighy as Rattlesnake Jake. Rangos adventures are related by a Greek chorus of sorts. Dressed in sombreros they play appropriate music and wonder out loud how long it will be until Rango dies. The screenplay is pitched at a more sophisticated level than is the norm for a non-Pixar animated film. The plot is more complex there are multiple villains and there are existential moments (although nothing as extreme as what viewers experienced the last time Verbinski and Depp collaborated Pirates of the Caribbean 3). While much of that will go over the head of the average child theres plenty of whiplash-inducing action with two standout sequences Mr. Rangos Wild Ride and the bat attack. The only ""missing"" kid-friendly element is the ubiquitous animated song and it isnt missed. Its tempting to argue that Rango is a richer experience for adults than for children because theres so much more in the film for viewers with significant cinematic experience. Nevertheless the movie has been assembled with a wide audience in view and at no time is it exclusionary of any demographic. In fact the humor is so broadly accessible that five-year olds and eighty-year olds will often laugh at the same jokes. In terms of quality Rango is the kind of movie one expects to see during the high profile summer or year-end seasons. Its to the benefit of movie-goers that it rides into multiplexes during one of the most barren stretches in recent memory. The story is about ending a drought and thats precisely what Rango accomplishes.

"Rango review Johnny Depp indulges his inner weirdo |       NJ.com comments Rango review Johnny Depp indulges his inner weirdo Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on March 04 2011 at 800 AM View/Post Comments PHOTOS COURTESY OF Paramount PicturesJohnny Depp provides the voice of the title character a chameleon on a wild adventure in ""Rango."" Johnny Depp is wearing a Hawaiian shirt. He seems to have mislaid his pants. He has the head of a green lizard and is wandering lost in the sunbaked wasteland of the Nevada desert. Just another day with Hunter S. Thompson. Except this is not a scene from the life of Dr. Gonzo or an outtake from Depps own tripping tribute ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas."" It is instead from ""Rango."" A new cartoon. For children. Yes when the going gets weird Johnny Depp gets weirder. Because at a time when so many animated features take the safe cuddly Happy Meal approach ""Rango"" proudly hitches its covered wagon to the mangy bug-eyed look of Tex Avery Big Daddy Roth Basil Wolverton and long-gone underground ""comix."" Movie Review RANGO (PG) Paramount (107 min.) Directed by Gore Verbinski. With the voices of Johnny Depp Isla Fisher. Now playing in New Jersey Rating note The film contains nudity sexual situations and gory violence. Stephen Whittys Review THREE STARS The slightly surreal animated story begins when a pet chameleons terrarium crashes in the desert -- marooning him with a paper umbrella a nude and headless Barbie and a wind-up fish. So the little fellow starts walking accompanied by an all-owl mariachi band -- and finds himself in a town straight out of a Sergio Leone Western complete with scrofulous villagers and low-life hired guns. The Leone references soon start piling up (along with the Ennio Morricone musical cues). But theres also a big nod to ""Chinatown"" (in its own way a modern Western). And some odd purely original touches -- like a mystic armadillo -- that come out of nowhere. The originality may be deep in the DNA -- Depp sometimes makes mistakes but he never makes anything youd expect him to and director Gore Verbinski (who worked with him on the first few ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies) is making his first cartoon. Even better the movie uses animators from Industrial Light and Magic who are also new to extended feature-film work. So whats here doesnt look like the perfect spit-and-polish work were used to. Its its own thing -- and sometimes admitted it gets lost in its own wanderings. The story easily could have been sped up by five or 10 minutes. And although the late appearance of one movie icon is fine an invocation of ""Apocalypse Now"" is both old and off-track. But Depp happily disembodied has a fine time with Rango who -- being a chameleon -- is constantly assuming different identities and hes nicely partnered by the work of Isla Fisher voicing his plucky pioneer love. Adults and slightly older children should have a great time. Will the movie appeal to the youngest toddlers? Probably not. Its rattlesnake villain is a little too scary and even its nicest characters are so ugly theyre likely to disgust small tots (and some of the indulgent adults who accompany them). So as a safe preschool matinee -- yeah its a little iffy. But as a midnight movie its going to have a long long life.

Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME In the town called Dirt the only thing with any liquid content is the tobacco spit of parched varmints. Water is so precious its kept in a bank vault except for the stash hoarded by the mayor. This town needs a hero and it gets one in the stranger who calls himself Rango. A CGI western comedy populated by desert critters Rango gives the film year a belated jump start with a passel of movie-wise fun and a knockout animation style. It ransacks then smartly twists elements of dozens of classic pictures from Chinatown to Clint Eastwoods No Name westerns to spin the familiar tale of a tenderfoot whos mistaken for a savior sheriff by rude hombres and the lone pretty girl. Except that the dude Rango (voiced by Johnny Depp) and the girl Beans (Isla Fisher) are lizards the mayor (Ned Beatty) is a turtle the chief gunslinger (Bill Nighy) is a rattlesnake mean enough to scare Samuel L. Jackson and the fatalistic sage of this sagebrush fable is a armadillo named Roadkill (Alfred Molina) who keeps trying to cross a dangerous highway because he croaks ""this is my destiny."" (See a brief history of Pixar.) For all the euphemistic cussin (ratings-wise Rango could be called a hard PG) and cigar puffing (which earned the picture a slap from the Smoke Free Movies lobby) this is at heart a pungent showbiz parable. The chameleon who will be Rango begins the story as a bon vivant thespian whose gig is a small terrarium owned by a family on the move. When the terrarium crashes on an interstate the traveling player is stranded. Winding up in Dirt he relies on his improv skills to win the job of sheriff. Not that the post is much in demand the previous sheriffs grave reads THURS.-SAT. R.I.P. The savvy humor that the movie mines from an actors fears and bravado can be attributed to screenwriter John Logan a master at portraying artistic temperaments in extremis; he wrote the TV movie RKO 281 about Orson Welles and the making of Citizen Kane plus Martin Scorseses Howard Hughes film The Aviator and Broadways Red which starred Molina as painter Mark Rothko and earned a Tony Award for Best Play. (See a brief history of movie special effects.) The cast led by the crack-voiced Depp and the Dolly Parton--channeling Fisher is flat-out flawless. But thats not surprising; theyre all gifted veterans. Rango though is the first animated feature from director Gore Verbinski (Pirates of the Caribbean) and the special-effects wizards at ILM. Somehow these novices figured out how to turn pixels into natural western landscapes; this looks like the most gorgeous live action movie. The scaly skin on its reptiles and the filthy hair on its rodents have a realism thats tactile even if you wouldnt want to touch them. And its in glorious 2-D so the images retain their full sere radiance. No goggles no gloom. And no competition for the coolest orneriest funniest best-looking movie of early 2011.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 04 2011 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 241PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English With his first animated feature Pirates of the Caribbean director Gore Verbinski shows ambitions considerably beyond producing the usual standard of most childrens fare. To put it plainly Rango is one weird movie. Among other things it features a mariachi band of owls functioning like a Greek chorus that tells us we are about to hear the story of the life and death of Rango. The titular character is a blue-skinned bug-eyed chameleon (voiced by Johnny Depp) who we first meet while hes in his terrarium acting out mini-dramas with his plastic fish a mannequin torso and fake palm tree. Movies Rango The official trailer A few minutes later a bump in the road sends him flying from his perch in the back of a car and his unseen owners drive on leaving him lying in a pile of broken glass on a Mojave Desert highway. After that the late Hunter S. Thompson (who Depp played in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas) makes a cameo. Next as Rango has a conversation with a dying armadillo (a truck tire has nearly severed his mid-section) audiences may begin to wonder who slipped a peyote button into their soft drinks. Gradually Rango becomes slightly more conventional a quest tale in the Finding Nemo line. Soon Rango meets a female lizard named Beans (Isla Fisher) who has an inconvenient habit of freezing at peculiar times (""Its a defence mechanism""). He also meets a girl rat (Abigail Breslin) who promises hell soon die. Through a series of accidents and some ill-advised boasting Rango finds himself the sheriff of a dried-up town called Dirt whose population consists of various rodents and reptiles. As it turns out the Fear and Loathing reference was just an appetizer. Rango is stuffed with allusions to other films. These arent Shrek-like pop-culture references but more Verbinskis homage to other filmmakers which gives Rango an eccentric personal quality. The plot echoes Bob Hopes The Paleface and its remake with Don Knotts The Shakiest Gun in the West about a fast-talking coward becoming in a case of mistaken identity a western hero. Otherwise its chock full of vintage movie references The towns mayor is an old tortoise (Ned Beatty) who controls the water supply and it doesnt take more than a moment to recognize his impersonation of John Huston playing Noah Cross in Chinatown. Theres an action sequence perhaps 10 minutes long and overly busy which involves Rango and a posse chasing down a gang of moles. In rapid succession it makes reference to the Ride of the Valkyries sequence from Apocalypse Now 2001 A Space Odyssey and various John Ford films set in Monument Valley. It even echoes True Grit a movie still in the theatres. True Grits cinematographer Roger Deakins was a visual consultant to Rango helping to create the anamorphic western landscapes which seem to mix Frederic Remington with Salvador Dali. The same sophistication extends to the screenplay by John Logan. The dialogue including Rangos stream-of-consciousness rambling goes by quickly but with an unexpected life-likeness. Rather than working in recording studios the actors performed on stages with partial sets and props captured on video as references for the animators. What will all this mean to children? Undoubtedly no more than that this is a story about a homely-but-cute young hero who must defeat an old tortoise for control of the water supply so the little animals dont die. But dont look for the big heart-tugging moments of Up or Toy Story 3. Though its level of execution is consistently high Rango is a non-pandering comedy that takes its message of western individualism seriously Its here for you and your children to enjoy - or not - as you please.

One of the immediate pleasures of this genre-tweaking Westward-ho ride is the way the various critters populating this dusty world have been rendered by the folk at Industrial Light amp; Magic. The fun starts with one very existential armadillo. With the characters whiskers and bristles and agate-marble eyes they are ugly-beguiling and prickly in the way desert fauna and flora can be. And eureka The movies in old-fashioned 2-D -- and its quite purty. A mariachi quartet of owls provides troubadour accompaniment for the legend strumming trumpeting and crooning about a ""hero who has yet to enter his own story."" Rangos tale takes a fateful turn when he spellbinds a saloon full of rough types with a fib about a bullet and an act of valor. Remember hes a chameleon. Which is either just another word for nothing left to lose or actor. And so Rango takes on the made-up name and a fabricated role of sheriff when theres actual villainy afoot. Isla Fisher portrays Beans a damsel with a strange habit of freezing mid- sentence. Neither a sequel nor a reboot this parable of accidental heroism will nonetheless ring a few bells for the adults in the multiplex. Theres a dash of ""Shane"" a dollop of ""High Noon."" The unctuous mayor (Bill Nighy) has a bit of Old Man Potter from ""Its a Wonderful Life"" in him and a lot of John Hustons indelible baddie Noah Cross. And with its sadly timely tale of an H2O-depleted town called Dirt and a fight for water ""Rango"" gives more than a wink to ""Chinatown."" Theres even a Jake. Forget it though -- this ones not a hero but a hired villain of a snake with a Gatling gun for a rattle. During his rather trippy quest for clarity and grit Rango meets a mysterious figure. He resembles a modern Western icon whose name we wont divulge but is portrayed by Timothy Olyphant whos remaking a name for himself as the lawman in the FX channels ""Justified."" ""Rango"" even borrows -- both in casting and weirdness -- from the Depp-Verbinski franchise ""Pirates of the Caribbean."" Only this time the swashbuckler is a gunslinging sheriff and the ocean is a sea of sand and cacti. And yes that is enough nods to other sources to make Rango a bobblehead. But the movie and much of John Logans writing is still pretty durn clever. The youngest moviegoers will neither know nor care about the movies packed corral of references (though chaperones be warned It does get racy in parts). For them Rangos a cold-blooded -- literally -- good guy.

By Peter Rainer Film critic March 3 2011 Save for later Saved Spoons (l.) voiced by Alex Manugian and Rango voiced by Johnny Depp are shown in a scene from the animated feature Rango. Industrial Light amp; Magic/Paramount Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of In the animated western ""Rango"" Johnny Depp has one of his best roles as a chameleon cut loose in the Mojave Desert who turns into the gunslinging savior of a parched town. True hes only the voice of Rango but this is Depp after all who can do more with his voice than most actors can do with their entire body. The nonstop inventiveness of ""Rango"" the first animated feature directed by ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" maven Gore Verbinski is almost never exhausting. Thats because it hews to a strong story line. By the way why is it that animated features these days - think ""Toy Story 3"" et al. - are almost always better plotted than dramatic features? Is it because the arduousness of working in animation helps pare down excess?But I digress. The best of ""Rango"" is a lot like the best of the first ""Pirates"" movie - crazily funny and rambunctious. It draws on an entire library of westerns most obviously ""High Noon"" and the Clint Eastwood-Sergio Leone spaghetti epics but it also draws on ""Chinatown"" and many other movies featuring reptilian bad guys. These borrowings are all done with high wit. (The screenwriter is John Logan.) Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Depps is not the only standout voice work Ned Beattys corrupt mayor Bill Nighys Rattlesnake Jake Timothy Olyphants Clint Eastwood parody and Isla Fishers Beans Rangos lizardly love interest are among the other standouts. The visual effects by Industrial Light and Magic designed by Mark ""Crash"" McCreery and his team are state of the art only occasionally veering into (literal) overkill. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? The animation is probably too scarily intense for children younger than around 8 years old. I noticed that the 5-year-old seated in my row laughed out loud at most of ""Rango"" but sunk into himself when the rattlesnake coiled into view. I was pretty scared too.

Comments (1) click to enlarge Rango Recommended Video Rated PG  107 minutes  2011 Gore Verbinski director of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise tries his hand at animation with this exuberant western parody combining flint whimsy and frat-boy humor. Johnny Depp gives voice to a chameleon who fibs his way into becoming sheriff of a desert outpost; the eccentric residents are plagued by a long drought and assorted predators the most menacing of whom is a two-faced water-hoarding mayor (Ned Beatty channeling John Huston in Chinatown). This features the usual slapstick double entendres and riffs on classic films but what elevates it above a cheeky romp is the skilled CGI work not only the wealth of tactile detail lavished on the parched townsfolk but also the painterly sand-swept vistas they call home.

Paramount Pictures hide caption toggle caption Paramount Pictures Rango Director Gore Verbinski Genre Animated action Running Time 107 minutes Rated PG for rude humor language action and smoking With Johnny Depp Abigail Breslin Isla Fisher Alfred Molina Watch Clips Rolling Bottle Rolling Bottle Credit Paramount Pictures Welcome To Dirt Welcome To Dirt Credit Paramount Pictures You Aint From Around Here You Aint From Around Here Credit Paramount Pictures Dirt a ramshackle town in the Mojave Desert is so dry it might better be called Dust but it sure proves fertile ground for Rango an animated western thats effortlessly the most exhilarating flight of computer-drawn fancy since Ratatouille. Rangos not just a kiddie-flick (though it has enough silly slapstick to qualify as a pretty good one). Its a real movie lovers movie conceived as a Blazing Saddles-like comic commentary on genre thats as back-lot savvy as it is light in the saddle. Populated by dog-eared rabbits desiccated gophers skinny mice and all sorts of other critters the town of Dirt is presided over by a garrulous turtle (voiced by Ned Beatty) and regularly terrorized by predators. Chief among the varmints is Bad Bill (Ray Winstone) a Gila monster with a reptilian gang backing him up and Rattlesnake Jake (Bill Nighy) whos got what looks like a Gatling gun where his brethren have rattles. But even Jake slithers away when pursued by the hawk that soars regularly overhead and that early in the film swoops after a screaming seriously out-of-his-element chameleon (Johnny Depp) in a loud Hawaiian shirt. Howd the chameleon get here? Long story. Lets just say he hit a bump in the road while seeking a true identity that he will find more or less accidentally in this ghost-town-in-the-making. Hes a hero albeit not a conventional one. A lizard with no name hes a suburban tenderfoot and thespian-in-training whos been raised in a terrarium with only a plastic tree a wind-up fish and a broken doll as companions. Still chameleons are nothing if not adaptable and once hes learned to walk the Western walk this chameleon will be calling himself Rango cozying up to a lady lizard named Beans (Isla Fisher) pinning on a sheriffs badge and -- armed with more bravado than common sense -- taking on bad guys. If ever theres been an actor who knows how to change his stripes its pirate/gangster/Mad Hatter/demon barber/dude-with-scissors-for-hands Depp. So casting him as an actual chameleon mustve seemed a no-brainer. That its worked out so well was hardly a given although with Gore Verbinski in the directors chair it always had a good shot. i Rango is aided by Beans (Isla Fisher) a feisty desert iguana who wants to rid her town of its untamed villains. Paramount Pictures hide caption toggle caption Paramount Pictures Rango is aided by Beans (Isla Fisher) a feisty desert iguana who wants to rid her town of its untamed villains. Paramount Pictures Rango is Verbinskis first leap into computer animation (not a long leap from the Pirates of the Caribbean flicks admittedly) -- and one he makes with the joy of someone who is well-versed in the limitations of live-action and cant wait to get around them. Here with help from the digital effects wizards at Industrial Light and Magic (also making their first foray into animation) hes framing shots from inside a rolling soda bottle or from angles that are as deliriously unlikely as they are spectacularly cinematic possibly because the great cinematographer Roger Deakins consulted on visuals. Deakins did the same thing a few years back on Wall-E but its clear that computer graphics have made advances since then. The light in Rango is breathtaking -- dusty shimmering -- and it seems at times as if Deakins realized that the photo-realism it allows for computer-graphic imagery gave him a chance to do all the shots that were too expensive or difficult to manage when he was shooting the live-action Westerns True Grit and No Country for Old Men. (Its worth noting that Rango is proudly and deliberately 2-D and far smarter about giving depth to its images than any of its animated 3-D predecessors.) Verbinski meanwhile is having a field day with riffs designed strictly for film buffs and with dialogue so loopy it often sounds improvised. (He ignored industry convention and gathered his actors together in a sound studio rather than recording them in isolation.) Theres hardly a big-sky stereotype he doesnt trick out with new tricks -- wait till you catch the man-with-no-name corker hes come up with -- but he and co-screenwriters John Logan and James Ward Byrkit are cribbing their plot points not just from classic Westerns but from the likes of Chinatown Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and Apocalypse Now. Kids will be too caught up in the shootem-ups to realize how much cleverness is sailing right over their heads but if youre past adolescence prepare to corral movie references as they stampede by. The more films youve seen the more fun youll have.

Its impossible not to get caught up in the beguil ing visuals of ""Rango"" an ultra-quirky animated Western with a vocal tour de force by Johnny Depp thats quite unlike anything Ive ever seen. The first major-studio toon in some time that doesnt employ 3-D technology presents colors and textures so vividly (courtesy of Industrial Light amp; Magic) that it still manages to become the most immersive cinema experience since ""Avatar."" This will be a four-star attraction for some but for all of the films considerable charms by the end I was getting a bit antsy from the rambling script and direction by respectively John Logan (""Gladiator"") and Gore Verbinski (the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" trilogy). Depp voices the title character nameless at first a coddled pet chameleon who is accidentally separated from his master and stranded in the Mojave Desert. Eventually he finds himself in a miniature western town named Dirt where he acquires his new name and the post of sheriff after inventing a story about killing seven brothers with a single bullet. The intricately designed Dirt is populated by a fascinating-looking collection of lizards moles amphibians and other critters. They include the mayor (Ned Beatty) a wizened wheelchair-bound turtle who has engineered a water shortage to buy up property. This ""Chinatown""-inspired plot is basically an excuse for a parade of highly inventive sight gags and manic riffing by Depp who gives perhaps the most inspired voice performance since Robin Williams in ""Aladdin."" Western tropes from John Ford to Sergio Leone make appearances with a detour into Sam Peckinpahs ""The Wild Bunch"" featuring a rattlesnake with a machine-gun barrel in his tail. Theres even a hilarious appearance by a certain Man With No Name -- voiced by Timothy Olyphant one of many standouts in an excellent voice cast that includes Bill Nighy Ray Winstone and Harry Dean Stanton. An homage to ""Apocalypse Now"" with flying mice is impressive -- at least initially. Verbinskis tendency to beat gags to death increasingly apparent in the ""Pirates"" series lets ""Rango"" drag on for about 20 minutes past its ideal length. While the visuals may be equal to or better than those in the Pixar features that studio is renowned for tight scripts and pruning shots that dont really advance the story. There are an awful lot of them here. Beans Rangos putative love interest voiced by Isla Fisher serves no function other than to reassure some audience members who might otherwise have questions about his fondness for musical theater and cross-dressing. ""Rango"" is being marketed as a family movie but the humor seems more aimed at adults than children. The younger kids at the screening I attended seemed largely confused or bored and afterward I saw some parents trying to calm down little ones scared by a more intense ending than youd expect from a PG rating.

Starring Johnny Depp Isla Fisher Abigail Breslin Alfred Molina Bill Nighy Harry Dean Stanton Ray Winstone Timothy Olyphant Ned Beatty Stephen Root Director Gore Verbinski Running time 147 Release Opened Mar 4 2011  Editorial Review Ann Hornaday reviews Rango By Ann Hornaday Thursday March 3 2011 ""Rango"" may not be Johnny Depps first cartoon (all ""SpongeBob"" fans now hail the Big Kahuna) but it marks the mercurial actors first foray into animated feature films - and the only question is what took him so long? Depp possesses one of the finest speaking voices in the business - a nimble mellifluous instrument that can go from sexy growl to fey warble in no seconds flat. And he brings all that protean talent to bear on Rango this ingenious neo-Westerns protagonist who isnt just chameleon-like but a chameleon period. When Rangos aquarium gets jostled out of a traveling car leaving its tender-footed inhabitant alone to fend for himself in the Mojave desert Rango drags himself to the dusty town of Dirt a dry and forbidding outpost ruled by a hard-shelled turtle mayor (voiced by Ned Beatty) and inhabited by a menagerie of rodents amphibians reptiles and sundry desert creatures. The most comely among them is a scaly bug-eyed lizard named Beans (Isla Fisher) who has enough sand to get the better of ""True Grits"" Mattie Ross in any horse trade. Soon after arriving in Dirt Rango - a born performer who assumes personae as easily as others of his species change color - seeks to impress the townsfolk in the local bar spinning a tall tale of murderous derring-do. Now a rootin tootin bona-feeday hee-roe Rango is appointed sheriff and soon thereafter discovers there might be more to the local water shortage than just a patch of bad weather. A chase ensues natch and its staged as an homage to the countless spaghetti westerns that along with ""Chinatown"" clearly inspired director Gore Verbinski. Dipping into a palette infused with sere browns tans and grays and commanding a microscopic level of detail Verbinski creates a world simultaneously fanciful and utterly believable. By the time ""Rango"" introduces the shaman-like Spirit of the West viewers may find themselves wondering how they got Clint Eastwood to make a cameo. A sun-baked symphony of rust and dust ""Rango"" has a spiky unsentimental appeal sending out slightly risque jokes to parents while staying safely out of the danger zone for kids. And for a cartoon it possesses perhaps the most unlikely added value of all authenticity. ""Rango"" may actually be the first Hollywood movie to use the familiar screech of a red-tailed hawk not as the voice of a soaring eagle or other bird of prey but as the voice of a red-tailed hawk. Bonus points for that. Contains rude humor mild profanity action and smoking.

"Rango The good the bad and the scaly | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesRango The good the bad and the scalyWacky animation is hard not to like -- for adults if not for kids.Rango features Johnny Depp as the titular reptile at his most out-there.  (Industrial Light amp; Magic / AP)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. March 3 2011 Rango (out of 4) Animated comedy featuring the voices of Johnny Depp Ned Beatty Isla Fisher Abigail Breslin Bill Nighy and Alfred Molina. Directed by Gore Verbinski. 107 minutes. Opens March 4 at major theatres. PG Just reading the ingredients of Rangos strange stew is enough to leave you as goggle-eyed as Johnny Depps title lizard. The film is a combo western parody and Chinatown homage by way of a Hunter S. Thompson drug hallucination and Roald Dahl adventure with hat tips to The Wizard of Oz Apocalypse Now 2001 A Space Odyssey and other film milestones. Its all these things and more but its not really for children despite the vivid animation by Industrial Light amp; Magic which now seeks to challenge Pixar and DreamWorks. There are some scary things in Rango notably a vicious serpent called Rattlesnake Jake and the tale runs a tad long at 107 minutes. But braver and more pop-savvy older kids will find it all a hoot -- and so will adults. You could imagine director Gore Verbinski and the resourceful Depp hatching Rango around a campfire or bong while the pair were working on their two instalments of Pirates of the Caribbean (a franchise that oddly enough I dont recall amongst Rangos myriad movie riffs although Bill Nighy a Pirates villain joins Depp on the vocal crew). Depp isnt one of the credited writers -- The Aviators John Logan gets most of the pen plaudits -- but Rango is Depp at his most involved verbally nimble and out-there. Theres a very meta moment where Depps Hawaiian-shirted lizard character bounces off the hood of the red convertible driven by the Hunter S. Thompson character Depp played in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Depp has become the lizard hallucination that HST was having in Fear and Loathing and we finally get to know the little green guy. Thats green for both colour and rawness since this pampered pet is one repressed reptile he fancies himself a worldly thespian yet he suffers from existential angst. ""Who am I?"" he frets. ""I could be anyone."" Fate and some careless driving provide an answer. He finds himself in the middle of Nevadas Mojave Desert struggling to dodge a hungry eagle and to understand a weirdly alluring female lizard named Beans (Isla Fisher). She leads him to a town called Dirt which couldnt be called Mud because the water has all but vanished and under mysterious circumstances. Its in Dirt where Rango digs in and really shovels the manure passing himself off as a bad-ass hombre and getting himself appointed sheriff. He may not look like the hero the denizens of Dirt were hoping for but hes all theyve got and he comes with his own mariachi band and a theme song that collides Sergio Leone with Quentin Tarantino. Rango may not be around that long anyway the tombstone of the previous sheriff lists his reign as ""Thursday to Saturday."" If the hawk doesnt get him Rattlesnake Jake (Nighy) just might unless Rango learns how to become the hero of his own fable. The whole enterprise is redolent of past movies (and drug trips) yet it somehow whiffs fresh. The very large part of the plot stolen from Chinatown in which missing water becomes akin to Sierra Madre treasure allows Ned Beatty to voice a splendid evocation of John Huston playing a gnarly turtle who is both the mayor and chief dust-disturber of Dirt. There are other great voice characters for what bears the tread marks of a potential franchise and toy-store bonanza. They include Alfred Molina as Roadkill a philosophizing armadillo; a possum named Priscilla (Abigail Breslin) who seeks a little sunshine; a spectral figure called Spirit of the West (Timothy Olyphant) who looks and sounds suspiciously like Clint Eastwoods Man With No Name. Theres also a curious credit in there would you believe True Grits Roger Deakins is credited as a ""cinematography consultant""? Im not sure what that is exactly for an animated film but Rango makes you just want to inhale deeply and forget about the details.

Johnny Depp as Rango a pet chameleon turned sheriff in Rango. (Paramount Pictures) Industrial Light amp; Magic In this film publicity image released by Paramount Pictures Rango left voiced by Johnny Depp and Beans voiced by Isla Fisher are shown in a scene from the animated feature ""Rango."" (AP Photo/Paramount Pictures Industrial Light amp; Magic) Jonathan Short Actresses Abigail Breslin left Isla Fisher right and director Gore Verbinski attend a photocall for the film Rango at a central London venue London Tuesday Feb. 22 2011. (AP Photo/Jonathan Short) Gore Verbinski created the Budweiser frogs ad campaign; his debut feature ""Mouse Hunt"" was like a live-action ""Tom and Jerry"" episode; and theres an unmistakably cartoonish quality to the three ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" flicks he directed. So its not surprising that Verbinski would now make a full-length animated movie.What is surprising is how much it mimics the experience of watching a classic Hollywood film. Without double-crossing the kiddie contingent ""Rango"" is iconic like a spaghetti Western smart like a 70s conspiracy thriller and lively like a Coen brothers comedy.The latter quality comes partly from the Coens cinematographer Roger Deakins who advised Verbinski on the look and lighting of the project. The team has created a feverishly detailed desert oasis the town of Dirt where a stranger arrives one dusty day. A lanky chameleon (voice of Johnny Depp) brags to townsfolk like the feisty belle Beans (Isla Fisher) that hes a gunslinger named Rango but hes really a city slicker a Hollywood house pet who fell onto the freeway during a moving-day mishap. An old turtle who is the towns mayor (Ned Beatty) enlists Rango to be the new sheriff. His job is to protect the ratty inhabitants and their dwindling water supply from the bandits led by Rattlesnake Jake (Bill Nighy). But as in ""Chinatown"" larger and darker forces are slithering across the valley. ""Rango"" is packed with pop-culture allusions from Eastwood and Tarantino movies to the discarded consumer junk from which the town is built. But while its dryly funny enough for hipsters its got hues that should attract an all-ages audience romance rollicking adventure and a timeless tale of heroism (underscored by a mariachi band of owls that functions like a Greek chorus).In reconstructing a classic Western on a chameleons scale Verbinski has given us horseplay of a different color.

Rango (Johnny Depp) is an ordinary chameleon who accidentally winds up in the town of Dirt a lawless outpost in the Wild West in desperate need of a new sheriff. Photo Industrial Light amp; Magic | Paramount Pictures Rango 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Johnny Depp has always had a touch of the reptilian about him -- one part stealth two parts darting unpredictability - but in Rango he goes a step further and actually plays a lizard. Not surprisingly the role fits him like a second skin dry green prone to shedding. The film itself is a magically strange hybrid a spoofy computer-animated Western acted out by anthropomorphic desert creatures. Depp voices the title character a wussy pet chameleon in a Hawaiian shirt whose terrarium crashes on a highway in the Mojave Desert rendering him homeless. He is at this point the Lizard With No Name a little creature unsure of his own identity and prone to blending in wherever he goes. Of course hes a chameleon. He has an excuse. When a half-dead - or all dead? - armadillo (Alfred Molina) directs him into the desert to seek water and find his destiny he obeys. What he discovers is Dirt a dusty Western town straight out of Sergio Leone a place where the coin of the realm is water - and the water is running dry. What he becomes is Rango the sheriff of Dirt a stone-cold killer in clacking boots and the hero of his own peculiar story. It entails most of what a Western generally entails the hock-spitting bullies and duels in the sun; the mystical Indian and manipulative mayor; the gun-toting maiden in braids (a mouse voiced by Abigail Breslin resembling Hailee Steinfeld in True Grit). We meet a black-hat villain with a pencil mustache - in this case a gun-packing rattlesnake with Bill Nighys raspy elocution - and a mariachi band composed of doom-and-gloom owls. A nifty Clint simulacrum also shows up in a woozy desert side-trip that evokes Jack Sparrows more surrealist escapades in Pirates of the Caribbean At Worlds End. If you didnt already know that Rango was directed by Gore Verbinski Depps partner in crime on the first three Pirates you sure would then. Its got that same strange brew of parody and genre tribute of madcap action set pieces and spooky meta moments of philosophizing. John Logans effervescent screenplay runs from wild eccentricity (at one point referencing prostate exams sure to baffle the PG crowd) to equally wild slapstick including one divinely timed incident of burping and an amusing bit of thievery from Singin in the Rain; kudos to you if you spot it. With its tumbleweeds and roadrunners and barreling canyon chase scenes it also owes an obvious and loving debt to those old Warner Bros. cartoons (meep-meep). It is all in all off its rocker. But its gorgeous the two-dimensional animation springs to life with more energy and impact than a lot of the 3-D weve been seeing of late. It pays sincere devotion to the classic Western touching on all the devices and archetypes that any fan of windswept heroism could hope for. And Depp is Depp - master of idiosyncrasy swisher of hips the self-aware and self-mocking peacock of his generation. All that and a lizard too. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Apple Smartwatches at Best Buy 50 off from 249 + free...

Nowhere in pop culture is this so dizzyingly played out as in big-screen animation. Every other week it seems there is some new creation full of fantastically realized creatures engaging in eye-tricking action. The ironic effect of this procession of candy-colored wonders is a so-what-else-you-got state of jaded exhaustion.And then along comes Rango. The new animated tale reuniting Pirates of the Caribbean star Johnny Depp and director Gore Verbinski is a stunning experience involving many different qualities all of which can be summed up best in a single word special.Start with the basics. In an era when good big-screen animation has become synonymous with a desk-lamp logo and a corporate brand Rango exists as something like the anti-Pixar -- and I mean that in a (really) good way. Where Pixar projects are invariably marked by their ability to be sweet-sentimental and smart Rango goes in an entirely different direction on the first count. Theres almost nothing sweet or sentimental about its titular hero a wayward chameleon or this tale of desperation and corruption. But Rango has smarts to burn. Where so many animated features go for belly laughs or heartache this movies attention is directed at viewers eyes and brains.On the surface Rango is easily the most beautiful dazzling work of art Hollywood has produced since well lets just say Avatar -- a feat it achieves without relying on a third dimension. In the films opening we marvel at the wonderful ugliness of our crooked-neck hero (voiced by Depp) weird scale-covered eyes with a dot of amber-gold glowing at the center of gross-green lids. We dont know where he is a desert island perhaps and then he puffs a breath and a cloud of fog appears on the glass between him and us. Its a small simple image but its a small miracle of computer-generated magic.Soon enough Rango is cast into a desert wasteland where he is counseled by a nomadic sage (in this case an armadillo) and sets out on journey of self-discovery. In short order he is bounced from car-to-truck-to-car and then terrorized by a swooping hawk both amazing action sequences in a movie full of them. Rango eventually meets a down-on-her-luck ranchers daughter (Isla Fisher) and winds up in the town of Dirt populated by a grotty group of rodents and reptiles suffering from a disastrous drought and a despotic mayor an ancient tortoise voiced by Ned Beatty.Its understood that Rango will save the town and win the heart of the ranchers daughter but how this happens is a brainy blast of imaginative and inventive fun. Verbinski working with co-writers John Logan and James Ward Byrkit has crafted a story that mixes literary allusion with movie references. The whole tale could be taken as a variation on Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas with Johnny Depps Rango standing in for Raoul Duke (the character Depp played in the movie). But its so much more. There is homage to Chinatown particularly in the mayors resemblance to John Hustons evil oligarch not to mention the many ways in which Rango is a paean to the spaghetti Westerns of Sergio Leone. And Don Quixote and Odysseus are two of the mythic heroes whose adventures are recalled.Meanwhile back on the surface your eyes will spin and stare as the wonders pile up. The attention to the play of light to texture is breathtaking. For all the sequences of frenzied actions perhaps the most affecting moments are of clear calm beauty as when Rango just stands and watches the shadows of clouds move over the desert sands.Take the kids take the parents but most of all take yourself -- Rango is for real.RangoA-Starring Johnny Depp Isla Fisher Ned Beatty Abigail Breslin Bill Nighy and Alfred Molina.

One of the Ds stands for width the other for height. Under the right circumstances these dimensions can combine to create pictures of great beauty. The circumstances here are right as rain even though the action takes place on a desert and in a desert town called Dirt thats starved for cool clear water. The landscapes are gorgeous the creatures that inhabit them are wildly inventive (as well as wonderfully voiced) and the visual references range from ""High Noon"" and the spaghetti Westerns of Sergio Leone through ""Stars Wars"" ""Gullivers Travels"" and ""Chinatown"" to the grotesqueries of Daumier and the Dali dream sequences in ""Spellbound."" The only thing thats missing is an emotional dimension. I watched this postmodern mashup with as much bafflement as wonderment thirsty for any trace of warm clear feeling. The hero voiced by Johnny Depp doesnt have a name at the outset; its only later that he calls himself Rango and passes himself off as the fearless sheriff that the downtrodden citizens of Dirt desperately need. Thats a welcome development since the first big but tentative sequence promises a film about a lizard struggling to survive on the Mojave without a plot. (Hes an actor lizard--or a lizardly actor--sandbagged by neurotic concern about who he really is.) ""Rango"" the movie has no identity crisis at all. Its being marketed on the strength of Mr. Depps popularity in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" plus the reputation of the director Gore Verbinski who directed the ""Pirates"" trilogy and the brilliance of its visuals will surely make it a huge hit. (Industrial Light amp; Magic did the animation a first for the special effects giant. Mark ""Crash"" McCreery designed the production and John Logan wrote the script.) ENLARGE Johnny Depp gives voice to the titular chameleon at center in Rango. Paramount Pictures Those visuals illustrate vivid characters. Theres Rango of course speaking in tongues as varied as those of Peter Lorre or Hugh Griffith and constantly changing costumes as he searches for the creature he was meant to be. (Yet his complexion seldom deviates from green. Isnt changing skin color rather than identity what chameleons are famous for?) Isla Fisher is the voice of Miss Beans a spunky bug-eyed heroine with a freeze-up affliction that could be petit mal. Abigail Breslin is young Priscilla lemuresque in her pointy physiognomy and goth in her poignant bleakness. Alfred Molina is Roadkill an armadillo mystic out of the writings of Carlos Castaneda. Ned Beatty a superb actor with an unmistakable voice is Dirts mayor. Like a road-company Elmer Gantry the mayor presides over weekly ceremonies that give Dirts citizens their measly rations of water (""Acolytes prepare the Holy Spigot."") Another superb actor Bill Nighy--he was the voice of Davy Jones in the ""Pirates"" films--is Rattlesnake Jake Rangos toothsome slithersome nemesis. In describing these individuals--mention should also be made of four owl mariachis who function as a Greek chorus--Ive made a good case for seeing ""Rango"" and why not; an eye feast is still a feast in this lean multiplex season. Be advised though of the films peculiar deficits. The narrative isnt really dramatic despite several send-up face-offs. Its more like a succession of picturesque notions that might have flowed from DreamWorks or Pixar while their story departments were out to lunch. The tall tales that Rango tells arent very funny. And the smash finish is a splash finish that doesnt quite make sense notwithstanding its ecological message. ""No man can walk out on his own story"" an intimidated Rango is told at one point by an Eastwood-esque man-with-no-name. But what if theres no story to walk out on? The Adjustment Bureau This free adaptation of ""Adjustment Team"" a 1950s short story by the science fiction writer Philip K. Dick is two movies for the price of one though only one of them--a fragmented romance within a ponderous parable--qualifies as a bargain. Watch a clip from the new sci-fi action-thriller The Adjustment Bureau starring Matt Damon. Matt Damon gives a strong unforced performance as David Norris a popular Brooklyn congressman with a bad-boy reputation whose seemingly unstoppable campaign for a seat in the U.S. Senate--his onscreen supporters include Michael Bloomberg and Madeleine Albright--is derailed at the last moment by the New York Posts decision to publish a photo of him mooning someone in college. ""The Post did not have to run the photo"" he says with rueful humor to a beautiful ballet dancer who replies in kind ""At least not full-page."" No the dancer isnt Natalie Portman redux. Her name is Elise she is played by the marvelous Emily Blunt and her scenes with David are spontaneous intimate and consistently delightful from the moment they first meet in a Waldorf-Astoria mens room. What shes doing there is more plausible than why he cant recover from his collegiate folly and anything they do to stay together--its love at first sight--is more plausible than any efforts of the Adjustment Bureau to keep them apart. ENLARGE Matt Damon and Emily Blunt take the stairs in The Adjustment Bureau. Universal Studios The Bureau a mysteriously omniscient operation with cosmic overtones is represented by unsmiling men sporting 1950s-style fedoras. (One of them is played by Anthony Mackie whose talents are squandered here.) The Bureaus determination to thwart the romance has to do with a host of ideas borrowed not only from the Dick story but from sources that seem to include ""The Matrix"" ""The Manchurian Candidate"" ""Inception"" ""The Butterfly Effect"" and for all I know ""Monsters Inc."" But this movies basic idea or thumbsuckingly deep notion has to do with free will versus predestination. Are David and Elise free to pursue true love or are they--and we and the whole human race--governed by unseen forces that we choose to bundle under the rubric of government or of God? I dunno though Id pose the question somewhat differently. Were the people who made this film--among them the writer and first-time director George Nolfi--governed by such unseen forces as knee-jerk sententiousness studio imperatives marketing experts and focus groups? Clearly the movies vital center was its romance. Almost as clearly the supernatural stuff around the lovers was straining to break free from conspiracy cliches by becoming blithe comedy--think ""Defending Your Life"" or an updated ""Here Comes Mister Jordan."" Instead grandiosity and production-value lust conspired against fun. Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives In the blue-tinged opening sequence of this beguiling and much-celebrated film from Thailand it is night and the camera gazes at a water buffalo tied to a tree. Is the placid beast Uncle Boonmee in one of his previous incarnations? Maybe he is or maybe he isnt--sometimes a water buffalo is just a water buffalo--but the silent apparition at the end of the sequence an upright creature with bright embers for eyes is definitely more than a man in a monkey suit. ""Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives""--I enjoy typing all the words of the title--is a special taste dreamlike and sometimes opaque or at least translucent to logical analysis. The widower of the title dying from kidney disease doesnt recall his previous lives so much as summon up visions from them and entertain beloved revenants from the life hes about to lose--specifically his late wife who remains young and beautiful in his eyes and their late son. ""Heaven is overrated"" they tell him. ""Theres nothing there. Ghosts are attached to people to the living."" The beautifully photographed production which was written and directed by Apichatpong (Joe) Weerasethakul--his previous films include ""Syndromes and a Century"" and ""Tropical Malady""--is often funny and sometimes comforting in its details the simple but effective medical treatment dispensed by an unlicensed male nurse the tender way Boonmees sister-in-law hugs his weakened body. I cant pretend to understand the intricacies of the Buddhist belief system that informs the surreal story or the fantasy system in which Boonmee embodying Thailand recalls his nations history and shimmering myths. Yet no effort of understanding is needed to be moved by Boonmees descent into a limestone cave shaped like a womb. Its where he was born and where he will die while ghosts attached to him watch his passing. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD FOCUS The Good the Bad and the Ugly (1966) ENLARGE In the last of the Man With No Name epics Clint Eastwood teams up with a pair of gunslingers played by Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef. The trio searches a visually sumptuous Southwest for a strongbox containing 200000 in gold. Sergio Leone directed this and the previous films in the trilogy ""A Fist Full of Dollars"" and ""For a Few Dollars More"" as well as the now-classic ""Once Upon a Time in the West."" Few directors of Westerns have been more widely imitated or more widely separated at birth--in Rome in 1929--from the genres roots. Sunshine Cleaning (2008) Emily Blunt Amy Adams and their director Christine Jeffs bring a steadfast sense of truth to Megan Holleys story of two sisters trying to jump-start their stuck lives and grow up. Ms. Blunt is a comic whirlwind with a still grave center. She is Norah the younger sister who lives with their father--hes played by Alan Arkin--and who joins Ms. Adamss fearful but courageous Rose in the bizarre career of biohazard removal and crime-scene cleanup. The excellent cast includes Steve Zahn Mary Lynn Rajskub Clifton Collins Jr. and Jason Spevack. Wings of Desire (1987) Last month I mentioned this German fantasy beloved by some and admired by many in connection with ""Unknown"" the common denominator being Bruno Ganz. He played an ex-Stasi secret cop in the Liam Neeson thriller and in this Wim Wenders film an angel stationed over Berlin who falls in love with a circus performer. I mention it again as an example of a fantasy that unlike ""The Adjustment Bureau"" goes right in spite of its solemn style. The circus beauty is played beautifully by Solveig Dommartin. Peter Falk as a convincing version of himself helps talk the angel back to earth. --Joe Morgenstern Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

"Rango Colors cant camouflage uneven humor - USATODAY.com Skip to Main Content USA TODAY Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather Rango Colors cant camouflage uneven humor By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Updated | | Share Reprints amp; Permissions Rango is a chameleon with decent intentions thespian dreams and identity issues. And the same could be said about this computer-animated movie. Industrial Light amp; Magic Paramount Pictures Spoons (voiced by Alex Manugian) left an old mouse chasing gold and pet chameleon Rango (Johnny Depp) whos being chased by a hawk. EnlargeClose Industrial Light amp; Magic Paramount Pictures Spoons (voiced by Alex Manugian) left an old mouse chasing gold and pet chameleon Rango (Johnny Depp) whos being chased by a hawk. It aims at an adult audience with wide-ranging cultural and cinematic references from journalist Hunter S. Thompson artist Salvador Dali author Carlos Castaneda ""spaghetti Western"" filmmaker Sergio Leone and the 1974 movie Chinatown. It also uses a kind of True Grit-like verbose polysyllabic dialogue which Johnny Depp pulls off adroitly. But the level of humor -- much of it distinctly of the bathroom variety -- is aimed squarely at the under-13 set. The result is an odd occasionally engaging but often cacophonous mishmash. As the amiable voice of Rango Depp re-teams with Pirates of the Caribbean director Gore Verbinski in this postmodern Western. CRAZY CRITTERS Rango team cant be caged in INSPIRATION Don Knotts and Hunter S. Thompson The generic chase scenes and explosions that come in the films final third are an effort to appeal to action fans but they add a further confounding layer. Still it has one strong asset a stylish look that doesnt fall for the overused 3-D trap. Its a pleasure to see a vividly animated movie without those glasses. Its not that an animated film cant be a hybrid. Toy Story 3 played to audiences of all ages and nimbly blended pop culture and kid-friendly humor. But that easy agility is lacking here. Mostly this feels like an ambitious undertaking with some awkward tangents executed unevenly. About the movie Rango  1/2 (out of four)Voices Johnny Depp Isla Fisher Bill Nighy Ray Winstone Abigail Breslin Alfred MolinaDirector Gore VerbinskiDistributor Paramount PicturesRating PG for rude humor language action and smokingRunning time 1 hour 47 minutesOpens Friday nationwide Our hero Rango favors Hawaiian shirts and imagines inanimate toys to be his actor buddies in his lonely terrarium existence. But unexpected events dump him in the vast Mojave desert. In those wide open spaces he meets a sage armadillo (Alfred Molina) who directs him on a path to enlightenment. Depp fans will particularly appreciate a scene in which Rango lands briefly on the windshield of the convertible from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas with Depps Thompson character from the 1998 film inside the car. After stumbling through the desert chased by a persistent hawk Rango comes upon a whole town of potential friends. The town called Dirt is suffering a stultifying drought and is run by a power-mad tortoise mayor (Ned Beatty). ""You control the water you control the desert"" is his repeated mantra recalling Chinatown. Rango bursts into the town eager to make a good impression. He convinces the furry denizens that hes a tough guy who can help them with their ""aquatic conundrum"" during one of the films most entertaining scenes in a local hangout. (Think Star Wars bar meets old Western saloons.) He just wanted some pals but somehow hes become the towns savior. Rango strikes sparks with a different species of lizard a spunky gal named Beans (Isla Fisher) who has spells of freezing up which she explains are a defense mechanism. This is a running joke -- as well as a nice piece of science education for the kiddies -- that works into the movies gentle dollop of romance. The animals are a strange-looking sometimes surrealistic lot. Some are so stylized that their species is hard to identify. A few wear elaborate garb; others sport just a cowboy hat. The Greek chorus a mariachi band of singing owls is a clever touch. Rango like the character has no lack of enthusiasm and inventive style. Its strong suit is visual panache. Its too bad that consistent comedy and emotional resonance get lost amid the dust and cacti. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Peter Travers reviews Rango in his weekly video series ""At the Movies With Peter Travers."" Rango bred to blend in finds himself forced to take center stage as a hero to question what constitutes good and evil and to work his way through a full-blown existential crisis. This is something that David Lynch might have directed not Gore Verbinski known for guiding Depp through the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy. Maybe Verbinskis early days as a punk rocker explains why he linked up with acclaimed screenwriter John Logan (Gladiator The Aviator) who began his career writing plays about the Leopold and Loeb ""thrill kill"" case and the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby. Rango is rated PG which suggests parental guidance. Start by explicating the nod to Depps Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas with a car driven by a guy in a Hawaiian shirt a gonzo allusion to Dr. Hunter S. Thompson (Rango wears the same shirt). Or how about the tortoise mayor (voiced by Ned Beatty) channeling the rapacious John Huston in Chinatown as he parches throats to seize water rights and build his own corrupt empire. Oddest is Rangos spaghetti-Western encounter with the Spirit of the West (Timothy Olyphant) in a Clint Eastwood poncho. ""Is this heaven?"" asks Rango. Try parsing the answer ""If this was heaven kid wed all be eating Pop-Tarts with Kim Novak."" Skeleton key anyone? Photos Johnny Depp and More Teen Idols on the Cover of Rolling Stone Whats up with this movie? It looks great thanks to Industrial Light amp; Magic. And Verbinskis idea to have the voice cast including Isla Fisher as Rangos lizard love and Abigail Breslin as a cactus mouse interact with one another in costumes (instead of in isolated sound booths) results in a lively lived-in ambience. Theres a slew of banditos and even a mariachi band to predict Rangos death in song. Plus a villain Rattlesnake Jake (Bill Nighy) slithery sizable and scary enough to keep you up nights. In a pinch Rangos mantra is ""crunchy creamy cookie candy cupcake."" Way too sweet. Im thinking ""brainy batty buzz bong bananas."" Rango is like nothing youve ever seen.

(Industrial Light amp; Magic) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday March 3 2011 312 PM Title Rango With the voices of Johnny Depp Isla Fisher. Animated adventure about a charismatic chameleon. Director Gore Verbinski (147). PG crude humor language violence mature themes. At area theaters. ""A strange and bewildering tale"" is what were told to expect when ""Rango"" begins and youd be hard-pressed to find a more apt description for Gore Verbinskis wonderfully inventive animated western. The latest collaboration between Verbinski (""Pirates of the Caribbean"") and Johnny Depp is sharp-edged surreal and often astonishing in its giddy creativity. What it is not however is a family film. Or at least not the safe cuddly type the movies ad blitz may have led you to expect. John Logans near-existential script is obsessed with death and violence and animals who are named ""Roadkill"" for a reason. Then again I cant remember the last animated hero as inviting as Depps Rango a lonely chameleon with untapped flair. He gets his chance to impress when he happens upon a parched community in the Mojave Desert where the central well has run suddenly suspiciously dry. After regaling the desperate citizens with outlandish tall tales Rango is elected sheriff -- a job it turns out he was born to do. Aided by a feisty lizard (Isla Fisher) and obstructed by a shifty turtle (Ned Beatty) Rango sets out to uncover the truth and save a town. A movie made by outlaw insiders ""Rango"" is the rarest of studio releases one that stubbornly resists limits. Which is not to say you need cult tastes to enjoy its irreverence. In a vocal performance of extraordinary range Depp offers something for everyone while those old enough to enjoy ""Pirates of the Caribbeans"" bawdy humor will welcome the similar sensibility here. Visual consultant Roger Deakins -- who last made ""True Grit"" -- ensures that each shot is a visual marvel. Really the animation is so gorgeously rendered it puts every 3D effort in recent memory to shame. Mostly though the picture feels as if it were made for movie-lovers -- and not just those ready to spot each cinematic reference but anyone who appreciates the risks film allows. Granted not every joke works and sometimes the pacing feels a little slow. But when uninspired comedies like ""Gnomeo amp; Juliet"" are the norm its nice to know theres also room for ""Rango.""

"Rango Movie Review - LA Times ENTERTAINMENT ENTERTAINMENT Movie review Rango Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic A marvelous mash-up of Old West and newfangled ""Rango"" rewrites the animation playbook with its eye-popping critters and varmints and its heros tale (tail?) of a chameleon desperate for a SAG card and a town desperate for a sheriff. What fun.In a world choked with animated films -- the good the bad and the ugly -- its hard to be either original or great. Yet director Gore Verbinski has done both -- and without 3-D -- breaking the rules and new ground in the town of Dirt. In this time-bending mind-bending just-go-with-it fable the story shifts from overcrowded freeways Hawaiian shirts and modern problems to covered wagons chaps and long-running issues of water rights land grabs and greed. And in a genuinely funny way it all makes sense. There were early signs of a mind that likes to operate off the grid in ""Mousehunt"" the first feature Verbinski directed. As a film it failed but its string factory decaying manse and devious mouse were strangely captivating anyway. Things finally jelled in the clever conceits he ginned up while directing the first three installments of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and he couldnt have done better than to get Jack Sparrow to go fully animated. With Johnny Depp as the voice of Rango get ready to be charmed from the first moments in the terrarium where as Lars hes passing time reading lines with a broken Barbie and dreaming of the big time.The crack screenplay is by John Logan (""Gladiator"" ""The Last Samurai"") working with a ""Pirates"" creative combine that included Verbinski conceptual artist James Ward Byrkit and visual effects wizard Mark ""Crash"" McCreery. Theyve given Lars a journey of self-discovery that begins with a car wreck on a highway that cuts through the Mohave. It lands the pampered pet in a desert nightmare but frees him to answer when destiny calls him to a town named Dirt that looks a lot like something out of ""High Plains Drifter"" complete with the saloon. Before you know it Lars has embraced the role of a lifetime. He steals the Rango moniker from a beer bottle pins on that badge and sets about high-nooning bad guys making eyes at a brown-eyed lizard named Beans (Isla Fisher) and trying to figure out where the waters gone. For this is a place where heroes -- and movie allusions -- are made with wild abandon much like ""The Wild Bunch.""Though Depp and Fisher dominate the films richness is because of its sprawling ensemble cast of characters. Among the standouts are Abigail Breslin as Priscilla a precocious young mouse; Alfred Molina as a spirit warrior armadillo named Roadkill (both a name and a sight gag); Bill Nighys terrific bad guy Rattlesnake Jake; Ned Beatty as the stone-fisted tortoise for a Mayor (a mix-tape of John Huston in ""Chinatown"" and a wheelchair-bound Lionel Barrymore in ""Its a Wonderful Life""). The look is in that old storybook style of fanciful beasts rendered in exceptional detail even if they are covered in warts or quills.The vibrancy of the acting no doubt finds its source in Verbinskis decision to put the ""voices"" in costumes and on sets to act out all the scenes together rather than working in the isolation of sound booths. The result creates a spark and a connection among characters that can often go missing in animation and a level of improvisation that seemed impossible for the genre.Verbinski went to Industrial Light amp; Magic for the animation with ""Rango"" the visual effects houses first and hopefully far from its last full-length animated feature. The company certainly has a history in character creation from its inception when George Lucas set it up for ""Star Wars."" Since then its left a deep imprint on many films including ""Terminator"" ""Transformers"" and ""Avatar."" But there is a freshness you can feel in ""Rango"" that comes from having new hands on deck. Though ""Rangos"" mostly dusty palette befits a parched town with not a drop of water (cue music) the massive sweep of the sky and the desert floor allows a critter to fill the screen or shrink depending on the context. The characters themselves are an eclectic bunch with whimsical touches everywhere from the inbred rodent gang led by patriarch Balthazar (Harry Dean Stanton) to the mariachi band of owls that shows up to serenade us throughout. For adults there is artistry and allusions aplenty even in Hans Zimmers score (surely someone will come up with a trivia game to cover the countless film references woven into nearly every scene). There is giggle-inducing slapstick high-stakes showdowns and even a moral to this story for the kids. All of which combine to create an Old West that is downright good old-fashioned entertaining.But Verbinskis greatest triumph is that he allowed the animation to free rather that confine him. There is indeed a new sheriff in town with ""Rango"" destined to become a classic. It will probably make a fistful of dollars too. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Rango (movie) Entertainment Movies Animation (genre) Johnny Depp Crime Law and Justice Gore Verbinski They needed some Mexicans in there Pop amp; Hiss premieres the Los Lobos theme to Rango Movie Reviews Rango premiere Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad83deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-rango-20110304,0,386345.story",200,rango21,rango,latimes

Thompson -esque chameleon who arrives in the parched town of Dirt to bring back the water.By Carrie Rickey Inquirer Movie CriticPosted March 04 2011Leaping lizards We all know that Johnny Depp is a chameleon. He plays one or more precisely voices him in Rango.This off-center animation from Gore Verbinski (Depps director in the Pirates of the Caribbean series) opens with a quartet of owls in mariachi garb singing the legend of the lizard. They pop up at regular intervals to musically comment on the chameleons exploits in the Southwest where the land is bone dry and the wit even more so.Rango is best enjoyed by those over 10 who have an idea of what ""existential"" means and can appreciate a surreal mashup of Chinatown Gladiator High Noon and The Good the Bad and the Ugly.You know those animated films that have bits that the parents will enjoy? Rango is mostly those bits. The film is for movie geeks and Depp fans tickled to see the gonzo actor role-play around. (Before he dons his chaps the chameleon sports a Hawaiian shirt and has the bad-boy attitude of the late iconoclast and journalist Hunter S. Thompson.)When first we meet the lizard he is improvising a scene with some interesting props the torso of a Barbie doll a toy fish a cocktail umbrella and one of those plastic spears used to deliver olives to the martini glass. Turns out he is a pet in a glass terrarium in the backseat of a car that gets sideswiped. Miraculously he avoids becoming roadkill.A philosophical armadillo (Albert Molina) directs the modern-day chameleon to the dusty 19th-century town of Dirt populated by thirsty reptiles parched rodents and the Mayor (Ned Beatty) a turtle who oozes sinister charm. Like Noah Cross the John Huston character in Chinatown the Mayor is busy diverting the water supply and keeping the townsfolk dependent and desperate. (Interestingly Chinatown was likewise the basis of Who Framed Roger Rabbit?)Enter Rango playing the part of the highfalutin rootin-tootin cowboy. The townspeople recruit him to be Dirts next sheriff a job whose duration typically is measured in hours rather than years. He befriends Bean (Isla Fisher) a red-ringleted reptile and with her organizes a posse to rehydrate Dirt.While the photorealistic animation (from Industrial Light and Magic) is exaggeratedly sharp (you can count the scales on Rangos E.T.-like face and the feathers on the singing owls) there is almost too much visual detail in Verbinskis busy movie. I was on optic overload which has the effect of upstaging the narrative.Still I enjoyed many of the visual touches especially the reptiles saddling up roadrunners and riding them through canyons.Yet while I laughed myself silly at the myriad movie references (especially one involving water beetles transporting the body of the fallen suggestive of the floating Russell Crowe at the end of Gladiator) are they too inside-baseball for younger viewers?Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + In promotional ads for the new lizard-out-of-water family comedy ""Rango much has been made of the fact that Johnny Depp and company didnt just stand around in a studio jabbering into microphones but acted out the slapstick on a soundstage with the digital animators taking the action from there.Its a novel approach that both works and doesnt. The film is an amiably bonkers fusion of a Sergio Leone spaghetti western ""Chinatown and more standard funny-animal fare but the on-set filming seems to have welded the cast together into a cohesive and high-spirited comedy troupe. You can feel the actors tossing energy one-liners and limbs off each other with gusto.Just as often though everyone mills around waiting for the story to go somewhere. ""Rango wants to send up every sagebrush cliche it can but the screenplay just piles those cliches on top of each other and waits for alchemy to happen. The director is Gore Verbinski the mastermind of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean franchise and like those movies ""Rango is a highly watchable but somewhat frustrating mix of sloppy plotting rascally attitude and Big Action.One thing I will say The thing looks great. The first digitally animated film to be made entirely in-house at George Lucass Industrial Light and Magic -- I know whoda thunk? -- ""Rango is a gorgeously textured visual re-imagining of a classic Western moviescape. The key color is brown of course but within that palette the magic minions of ILM find infinite shades of gold tan mud straw sunlight mountain desert and tobaccy juice.Not to mention the rest of the spectrum since the hero is a chameleon. A household pet with an overactive imagination hes initially nameless but after a near-collision bounces him from his owners car into the Mojave Desert he washes up at a dusty frontier town and dubs himself Rango. The citizens -- an unwashed menagerie of burrowing owls buzzards horned toads gophers -- buy his rip-snorting tall tales of plugging seven villains with one bullet and quickly elect him sheriff. Didnt Bob Hope star in this once upon a time?Yes and probably Porky Pig too but they didnt have the richly nubbled eye-cones of Rango nor his appealing bluster. Depp gives the little guy spirit and likability and hes relaxed enough to share the soundtrack with a cast fat with characters. Isla Fisher (""Wedding Crashers) voices the role of Beans a comely iguana trying to save the ranch her daddy left her; with her immense lamplike eyes shes a ringer for the actress Illeana Douglas. Bill Nighy is a gun-slinging rattlesnake Abigail Breslin a lil girl mouse Alfred Molina a Quixotic armadillo aptly named Roadkill. Ned Beatty last heard as the evil pink teddy bear in ""Toy Story 3 is now the shady tortoise town mayor who owes much of his personality and some of his dialogue to John Hustons Noah Cross in ""Chinatown.As in that film the politics of water drive much of the action but ""Rango also throws in as many Western elements as it can think of -- a saloon scene a posse chase a showdown in a canyon a shootout on Main Street -- without much rhyme or reason. Theres a cameo appearance by one Raoul Duke of ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and late in the film up pops Leones Man with No Name himself voiced by Timothy Olyphant and facially reconfigured just enough to keep Clint Eastwood from litigating.Its a fun movie and a noisy one but not the great work of family-friendly gonzo this particular crew could have created with just a little more focus.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Theres a terribly dull predictable movie at the heart of the CGI Western spoof Rango. The central mystery is a straight-ahead surprise-free slog (a bit similar to Chinatown minus the sex and the story twists though with the murder intact); the characters are familiar tropes and the tone and imagery come courtesy of countless Westerns from Sergio Leone to High Noon. When a pet chameleon (Johnny Depp) accidentally freed from his aquarium winds up in a rough parched Mojave Desert town and decides to recreate himself as a gun-slinging hero named Rango there are no surprises in store Everyone around him is exactly what they appear to be from the scheming mayor with Ned Beattys gravelly voice to the tough-but-sensitive ranchers daughter (Isla Fisher) with no purpose except to play love interest and hostage. And the ending is so heavily foreshadowed it practically flashes onscreen in neon lights from the opening scenes. But ignoring the weak storyline entirely Rango is a joyously weird experience far more concerned with texture and flavor than with elaborate narrative. The lopsided art style comes with a hefty dose of inspiration from gonzo artist Ralph Steadman acknowledged via a cameo appearance by a Hunter S. Thompson caricature. The timing playfully alternates between expansive and manic just as the comedy lurches from dumb puns to cinematic in-jokes to broad farce. Depp is similarly diverse muttering to himself in a variety of curious voices or emitting full-throated gargling Kermit The Frog howls of alarm. The aesthetic gets demented and at times grotesque particularly as embodied by the quartet of sad-eyed doom-predicting mariachi owls who serve as a Greek chorus and the Alfred Molina-voiced armadillo cut nearly in half on a busy road. Director Gore Verbinski (fresh off the Pirates Of The Caribbean movies) and screenwriter John Logan (The Aviator) seem to be more interested in creating a twisted fever dream of a world than in telling an actual story. And for a while rich visuals an anarchic sensibility and an adult Western-tinged take on life death and existentialism carry the film. But Rango never integrates these imaginative trappings with its overly obvious core elements. It wants to say a lot of things about the way people voluntarily recreate themselves either by embracing a change of scenery and circumstance or by letting fantasy archetypes and familiar fictions shape their self-images. But the chameleon theme extends past the protagonists species and his self-mythologizing attempts to blend into his new world All the color in Rango is just a skin-deep patina that would be more convincing if it went deeper down to the bones.

"Rango sells its soul for live-action - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Rango sells its soul for live-actionRango -- 1 1/2 starsMarch 02 2011|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticAs a family-demographic product ""Rango"" has a million selling points among them an unusually strong voice cast headed by Johnny Depp in tremulous-aesthete mode; a popular live-action director making his feature animation debut; and a twist on a genre temporarily back in vogue thanks to ""True Grit."" It is for what it is a work of considerable care and craft. And its completely soulless. I may be in the minority. But seeing this sour riff on everything from to ""Cat Ballou"" to ""Chinatown"" to ""The Shakiest Gun in the West"" with a big suburban preview audience was instructive. Not much laughter. Moans and sobs of pre-teen fright whenever Rattlesnake Jake slithered into view threatening murder. Any one crowds response to any movie may not be indicative; nonetheless the audiences mood seemed in synch with my own. The best contemporary animation from Pixar to (occasionally) DreamWorks works for various ages in varying ways. ""Rango"" written in a spirit of strained homage by John Logan and directed by Gore Verbinski (of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise) seems to be made for an audience of jaded Sergio Leone fanatics. Too bad because the premise isnt bad. A terrarium-confined chameleon finds himself suddenly free but lost in the Mohave Desert guided by a Quixote-like armadillo toward his destiny. This involves becoming the new sheriff of a miserable town called Dirt not far from modern-day Las Vegas. Dirts mayor controls the precious water supply. No one expects the new citified boy in town to last long. No one seems to care if he lives or dies. The violence both threatened and depicted is squarely in the spirit of the Leone Westerns where the hyperbole and the stylization makes sense as well as making some great cinema. Here it does not. In fact there is no stylization which brings us to the most interesting question posed by ""Rango."" When computer-generated animation sticks this closely to photorealistic landscapes and gunplay and menace even with a cast of animated lizards and prairie dogs and birds does the result feel like something for kids? Logans script creates a fully populated world of greed malice and One True Inadvertent Hero but the wit and charm is scant. Logan and Verbinski rely mostly on references to other films that were not animated but were in fact full of life either comic (the onscreen troubadors of ""Cat Ballou"" are repurposed here as a mariachi quartet) or dramatic (the ""Chinatown"" greedy-developer scenario). Roger Deakins the ""True Grit"" cinematographer who got passed over for an Oscar this week served as visual consultant on ""Rango"" as he did on the far far superior ""How to Train Your Dragon."" The shimmer of the setting desert sun the dust-choked streets the high-noon gunslingers showdown all the pictorial tropes are present accounted for and handsomely realized. And they come to almost nothing. Rango never shuts up but he never has anything funny or touching or clever to say. By the time The Man With No Name (Clint Eastwood but voiced by Timothy Olyphant) arrives to make jokes about the lusciousness of Kim Novak its like Huh? Wha? ""I found a human spinal column in my food once"" goes one line. References to shooting off critters ""giblets"" or ""unmentionables"" abound. One character walks around with an arrow sticking out of his eye. Leave it to the Motion Picture Association of America to rate ""Rango"" for ""rude humor language action and smoking"" but not apparently for the v-word. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating PG (for rude humor language action and smoking) Voice cast Johnny Depp (Rango); Isla Fisher (Beans); Abigail Breslin (Priscilla); Alfred Molina (Roadkill); Bill Nighy (Rattlesnake Jake); Ned Beatty (Mayor); Stephen Root (Doc Merrymack); Harry Dean Stanton (Balthazar); Ray Winstone (Bad Bill); Timothy Olyphant (The Spirit of the West) Credits Directed by Gore Verbinski; written by John Logan; produced by Verbinski Graham King and John B.

His accomplishments are even more impressive considering all the strikes against him in this simpatico if effortful computer-animated family comedy about the value of self-actualization and the appeal of American Westerns. For one thing Rango -- the chameleon voiced by Johnny Depp -- is involuntarily magically launched from the 21st century into his new life in the 19th-century Old West as the result of a shattering road accident in the Mojave Desert at the beginning of the picture. (We can only assume the family in whose car the pet was traveling perished. Never mind dont look theyre never spoken of.) For another thing Rango -- the movie -- takes a long time finding a story line to stick with. First the lizard liberated from domestication by humans gets a crash course in outdoor life skills. (In the desert blend in) He staggers into a dusty town called Dirt and decides to reinvent himself as a gunslinging hero. (In town stand out) After being rewarded for inadvertent acts of bravery as town sheriff he decides that being a hero is too hard. Then he changes his mind and sticks to his er gun. Hes fickle hes a chameleon. So sue him. Depp brings the same playful charm and love of make-believe swashbuckling that he showed in his Pirates of the Caribbean adventures which were directed as is Rango by tumult-prone Gore Verbinski. Thanks to Depps own chameleonlike performance and the camaraderie of the casts voice-recording sessions run like live theater the script has a lively improvised feel. (The sardonic screenplay was written by Gladiators John Logan and developed from a story by Logan Verbinski and James Ward Byrkit.) The lizards costars include Beans (Isla Fisher) a girl reptile with true grit; the mayor of Dirt (Ned Beatty) a tortoise who controls his towns dwindling water by taking his cues from John Hustons sinister Noah Cross in Chinatown; a philosophizing armadillo (Alfred Molina) with a lance borrowed from Don Quixote and a cartoon-Spanish accent borrowed from Antonio Banderas in Shrek; and the Spirit of the West (Timothy Olyphant) a man with no name who bears a close vocal and poncho-costumed resemblance to Clint Eastwood. The biggest strike against Rango though -- for both the movie and the hero -- is that the lizard is so damn ugly. As are his animated colleagues. And by ugly I mean remarkably repellently did this really test well with audiences? Jar Jar Binks ugly. The Geico gecko is a far far more telegenic star than the asymmetrical bulbous green creation whose face with its hints of E.T. and Kermit the Frog DNA fills so much of the screen so much of the time. Beans is worse Shes got the kind of you guys are useless (so Id better do this myself) gumption characteristic of so many heroines in family-oriented animated projects these days -- and she really does look like Jar Jars reptilian cousin crossbred with a strain of Avatars Navi genetic code. The warty hairy tongue-flicking animal cast is all the more distracting for taking away from the productions obviously loving appealing attention to perspective and background detail. (Rango is the first full-scale animated feature generated by the redoubtable special-effects house of Industrial Light amp; Magic.) Care has gone into the re-creation of iconic shots from great American Westerns -- Rangos climax is pure High Noon -- and in the last act the story does coalesce into the satisfying shape of a classic showdown during which the hero no one thought would last a day in such a mean old town prevails not only against external evil but also against his own weaknesses. Neither Rango the mash-up movie nor Rango the lizard is particularly lovable. But theres no denying the intrigue in its combination of the good the bad and the ugly. B?

In this animation from Pirates of the Caribbean director Gore Verbinski Johnny Depp voices Rango a pet and wannabe actor who is marooned in a desert and stumbles across a frontier town running low on water. Reinventing himself as a hero who killed seven outlaws with a single bullet Rango becomes sheriff and starts to tackle the drought problem.There are some wonderful things in Rango the dialogue is witty the animation is dizzying and the action is stunningly choreographed. Its a film of astounding detail from the marks on Rangos skin to countless little in-jokes and references. But theres the problem the film is so convinced of its genius throwing in a twist from Chinatown here a cameo from Hunter S Thompson there that it feels pleased with itself. The idea of the tortured thespian chameleon seems deep at first but it becomes laboured. Rango would have worked well as a ripping family-friendly tale packed with incident and humour; in trying to be too clever it risks alienating its audience.

The animation in Rango is good but not outstanding - certainly theres no sense of texture and unusually these days its 2d not 3d. But the jokes and gags are a bit thin on the ground.

Rango Good Director Gore Verbinski. Cast Johnny Depp Isla Fisher Ned Beatty. Rating PG for rude humor language action and smoking. Guide to this weeks new releases Spotlight Johnny Depp Animated favorites How Gore Verbinski wrangled Rango Director Gore Verbinski has crammed the movie with references to other films sometimes combining more than one simultaneously (such as in a rollicking chase scene - be on the lookout). Really good movies too such as ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Star Wars."" Throw in the offbeat vocal talents of Johnny Depp as the title chameleon and you have a really fun film. Rango is a somewhat lonely pet living in a terrarium and dreaming up dramatic scenes to play with the Barbie torso that shares the space. But an accident results in his being set free on the open highway a place he is uniquely ill-equipped to be. He gets cryptic advice from the aptly named Roadkill (Alfred Molina) an armadillo who takes the why-does-the-chicken-cross-the-road puzzle to epic Mount Everest because-it-is-there levels (with varying results). Find Dirt Roadkill says but its only after meeting the spunky Beans (Isla Fisher) a lizard with a tendency to freeze up when stressed that he learns that Dirt is a town and its dying. Its citizens also live in fear of a hawk that already has menaced Rango as well as Rattlesnake Jake (Bill Nighy) a bad guy as mean as a . . . well you know. This is where the movie really kicks in. Rango like any good Western hero sees an opportunity to reinvent himself. Hes pretty much a coward when he arrives in Dirt but fate intervenes to make him seem a hero and before he knows it the Mayor (Ned Beatty) a gruff old tortoise has made him sheriff. All well and good but even a lawman cant solve Dirts biggest problem Its running out of water which is treated as currency in the dusty crusty town. Why the town is going dry is a mystery one that Rango sets out to solve. Rango and Beans have seen water dumped in the desert. That makes no sense. And the Mayors behavior is certainly odd for the leader of a town in such dire straits. The way the story plays out probably will confuse some kids (and grown-ups); if you want another great-movie reference you could probably throw the title ""Chinatown"" around with some accuracy. The real entertainment here is the getting there following Rango and his cohorts through a revolving tale of changing loyalties and rising to the occasion. Depp is outstanding mumbling his way through the creation of a new identity. Beatty is too his deep voice and molasseslike accent smoothing over the rough edges of his plans. Nighy is suitably evil as Rattlesnake Jake who like the classic Western black hat knows and respects a worthy adversary when he sees one even if it takes some time for that recognition to play out. Abigail Breslins Priscilla some sort of rat-looking creature is adorably morose as a death-obsessed kid who left in charge of things while Rango and his posse are out trying to solve the mystery of the disappearing water cant wait to gut-shoot somebody. The animation is what we have come to expect by now seamless. And one of the nice things about the film is that its not filled to overflowing with adorable animals. Priscilla really does look like a rat; Beans wide-set eyes make her um not as attractive as the actress who plays her; and the mole Balthazar (Harry Dean Stanton) is disgusting (as are the creatures who hang out at the saloon). Its refreshing to see an animated movie that doesnt look as though the idea for the Happy Meal came first. Instead ""Rango"" relies on its characters and theyre a hoot. The movie is too.

Cranston Hamm more Toy Story toys burn up in prank on mom In the manic animated ""Rango"" which stars Depp as a chameleon our coordinates are similar and the hallucinogens are well under way. Its as though the drug-conjured lizards of ""Fear and Loathing"" have been contracted by Hollywood and tasked to make a Western. Go West young reptile. But ""Rango"" proceeds from a presumably more sober place the mind of director Gore Verbinski who helmed the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" trilogy. Its his first animated film but if you recall Depps Jack Sparrow youll note that Verbinski is well acquainted with cartoons. ""Rango"" is also a first animated feature for the effects house Industrial Light amp; Magic. Quick facts Starring Voices of Johnny Depp Alfred Molina Abigail Breslin Director Gore Verbinski Run time 1 hour 47 minutes MPAA rating PG Together theyve created perhaps the most cinematic animated film since Pixars ""Ratatouille."" As a slapstick comedy it doesnt have the emotion resonance of a Pixar film but its a visually stunning endlessly inventive completely madcap Western made with obvious love for the genre. ""Rango"" begins as movies should with a Mariachi band of musical owls. Our narrators they introduce the film and our hero an early hint at the self-consciousness pervading the wink-filled ""Rango."" Story Lots of kidding around in 2011 family films We find our chameleon protagonist in full theatrical flight turning his pet lizard tank into a film set with supporting roles played by an inanimate fish toy and a palm tree ""Acting is reacting"" he knowingly professes to no one. Advertise Advertise Advertise With a wide flat Don Rickles mouth and two giant bowl-shaped eyes Rango clad in a red Hawaiian shirt doesnt look like your normal animated hero. We quickly learn that hes a precocious young actor whose life cooped up as a pet has habituated his imagination to flights of fancy. He is badly in need of an audience. Rango is bounced out of his cage by a bump in the road and -- in a beautifully done scene -- tossed from the back seat of his unseen owners onto a Mojave Desert road where he comes careening to a stop atop a broken piece of glass.

Cranston Hamm more Toy Story toys burn up in prank on mom Rango winds up in the old rickety desert town of Dirt. Despite a resume that includes as he claims two one-acts and a working musical Rango -- less a chameleon of color than of character -- dons the role of gunslinger so that he might impress the townspeople. Video Depp on acting out emotion capture for Rango (on this page) Inside a saloon he claims with great bravado that he comes from the West ""beyond the sunset"" and vanquished seven with a single bullet. Rangos dialogue from John Logans witty screenplay is thoroughly Deppian in its verbosity. Rango boasts of eating men like the menacing Gila monster Bad Bill (Ray Winstone) for breakfast adding ""Then we braise him in clarified butter."" Rango is convincing enough that hes made sheriff of Dirt. Its a town teaming with ragged curiosities a drunk rabbit (Stephen Root) a slinky fox (Claudia Black) a wide-eyed and cynical mouse (Abigail Breslin) the prairie dog Balthazar (Harry Dean Stanton). Theres also the potential love interest lizard named Beans (Isla Fisher). Dirts problem is water. Its dwindling supply is kept in a large jug in a banks vault. The towns tortoise mayor (Ned Beatty) tells Rango ""You control the water you control the desert."" With folksy villainy and a creaky wheelchair the mayor is a perfect stand-in for John Hustons Noah Cross of ""Chinatown."" That film supplies the frame for much of ""Rango"" though only to a point. Incest is tabled and no nosey fellows get their nostrils sliced but solving the mystery of the missing water is Rangos mission. He seems no better equipped than Jake Gittes to solve what he deems Dirts ""aquatic conundrum."" (His advice to one little creature ""Burn everything but Shakespeare."") But Rango is a method actor and he eventually becomes the part. Slideshow Disneys animated films take flight (on this page) As smart as ""Rango"" is what most stands out is its simulation of light. With the great cinematographer Roger Deakins serving as a visual consultant and visual effects headed by Mark McCreery the refraction of light in ""Rango"" may be the pinnacle yet in animation. Shadows fall through the saloon -- with glowing amber glasses of whiskey (or ""cactus juice"") -- so authentically designed that one swears the room full of gun-totting varmints is real. Wisps of dust swirl across the roads cracked pavement. Like Wes Andersons entry to animation ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" Verbinski has brought live-action tools to an animated medium. The results in ""Rango"" are so lively that the post-movie conversation will go some time before any moviegoer remembers that 3-D was (thankfully) omitted. The movies postmodernism could be considered too cloying but it comes off charming especially because it pulls from such great sources. The Spaghetti Westerns of Sergio Leone are joyfully referenced complete with a cameo from the Man With No Name (voiced by Timothy Olyphant not Clint Eastwood). Hans Zimmers score is a playful ode to those of Ennio Morricone. Perhaps a new classification has been born the ""SpaghettiOs Western."" Copyright 2011 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Thompson Not Enough Laughs Wednesday March 2 2011 at 4 a.m. By Nick Schager 1 A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - A rollicking surreal and existential kids Western that worships at the altars of Sergio Leone Hunter S. Thompson and Chinatown Rango drowns under the weight of discordant objectives and influences. With his crooked neck bug eyes and Hawaiian shirt reptilian Rango (boisterously voiced by Johnny Depp) is a Ralph Steadman creation come to anxious anthropomorphic life. A lizard with delusions of dramatist grandeur Rango is unceremoniously stranded in a simmering Nevada desert eventually stumbling upon the drought-plagued frontier town of Dirt. Assuming the part of a lifetime Rango feigns gunslinger grit and nabs himself the job of sheriff tasked with returning water to the thirsty citizenry--a heroic mission that director Gore Verbinski and Industrial Light amp; Magic (both working on their first fully animated features) visualize with inventive photorealistic cartoonishness. Rangos ultimate quest is a search for the self which his saga suggests--via myriad Thompson references and meta-cinema twists including run-ins with Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo as well as the Man With No Name--is achievable through role-playing fiction. Yet for all its genre-bending cleverness and technical dexterity Rangos overstuffed plot fails to consistently blend its brainy pretensions with its chase-and-slapstick family-film obligations. Like Dirts H2O supply laughs are scarce.

"Rango | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Review Rango Peter Debruge Chief Film Critic AskDebruge 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr March 1 2011 | 1000AM PT Gore Verbinskis astonishingly adult-skewing animated debut is a comedic riff on the Wild West formula. Johnny Depp isnt the sort of star to blend in so its saying something that his turn as the worlds most conspicuous chameleon in ""Rango"" is so full-bodied you forget the actor and focus on the character. Depp is but one voice in the all-around impressive ensemble Gore Verbinski assembles for his astonishingly adult-skewing animated debut a comedic riff on the classic Wild West formula that could if viewed in the right light just as easily serve as one long ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas""-style hallucination. With kid appeal aplenty the eccentric yet aud-friendly result should rustle big business worldwide. This stunning virgin foray into feature-length animation from Verbinski and the vfx miracle workers at Industrial Light amp; Magic (his primary collaborator on the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" pics) looks and feels nothing like the toons that have come before. ""Rango"" boasts not only the most photoreal visuals this side of ""Wall-E"" but a refreshingly unique narrative sensibility to boot starting with its Charlie Kaufman-worthy opening monologue and Greek chorus -- technically a mariachi band of bright-eyed Mexican owls whose songs fit the scores playful marriage of Hans Zimmer bombast and Los Lobos energy. Depp plays a zonk-eyed pet lizard traveling cross-country through the Mojave Desert when a freak accident leaves him stranded in the blistering sun. Far removed from his natural habitat the green-skinned Hawaiian shirt-wearing reptile finds it virtually impossible to camouflage himself in his new all-brown environment choosing instead to pass for something hes not a fearless gunfighter named Rango. With no real-world experience but a near-inexhaustible supply of good luck Rango looks exactly like what the naively optimistic denizens of Dirt need right now a hero. Their old-timey desert outpost is beset by predators and ruled by a corrupt mayor (Ned Beatty playing a less huggable villain than he did in ""Toy Story 3"") who clearly has a hand in the mysterious drought making all their lives miserable. That much even younger auds should be able to follow though John Logans hilarious script is loaded with two-dollar dialogue and wonderfully baroque expressions sure to confound even a fair number of adults. Live-action helmers have had mixed success making the transition to animation of late but Verbinski brings real vision to the endeavor conceiving a world that starts small -- contained within Rangos terrarium in fact -- and gradually expands to accommodate nearly all of Monument Valley in a way auds can intuitively follow. Even more impressive than the world itself is the incredibly varied ensemble that populates it a motley mix of reptiles and rodents in which no two are redundant each memorably designed by Mark ""Crash"" McCreery and his team then brought to life via a bulls-eye match of critter and character actor. Though the entire cast is terrific standouts include Bill Nighy as venomous Rattlesnake Jake Ray Winstones menacing gila-monster henchman Bad Bill and Isla Fisher as Rangos long-lashed love interest Beans. Where ""Rango"" ultimately falters is in the uncomfortable juxtaposition of kid-friendly entertainment -- represented by unnecessarily bombastic fight scenes that feel out of place within Logans more intellectually spirited screenplay -- and the savvier self-reflexive humor clearly aimed at adults. The only major pop-culture references here are a cameo by a Hunter S. Thompson lookalike and an amusing run-in with a mystic Man With No Name-esque figure (voiced by Timothy Olyphant). Though most of the laugh-out-loud moments result from either witty wordplay or inspired physical comedy even the fart jokes feel fresh by contrast with the delivery weve come to expect from toondoms more established players. Its hard to call originality ""Rangos"" greatest asset when the story itself trades so heavily on established Western movie tropes but the project clearly comes from a completely different place than any other American-made animated feature. That radical departure is reinforced by the look of the film which is now the third toon to rely on Roger Deakins as a virtual cinematography consultant. Considering ILMs incredible background in live-action vfx its no surprise the company brings a staggering level of realism to the lighting and textures throughout. The shocker is just how good their character animation work is From the way Rango walks to the subtlest eye twitch this quirky chameleons screen presence is more plausible than even some of Depps most beloved flesh-and-blood creations raising the bar for other studios going forward. While on the subject of eyes Rangos peepers violate the prevailing wisdom that bigger is better with scaly lids covering all but a tiny pinhole at their center inviting us to consider the performance of the characters entire face rather than just his shiny irises. It should also be said that even projected in 2D ""Rango"" makes better use of dimension than many stereoscopic toons.

Daily Edition Login to download Rango Film Review 1000 AM PST 3/1/2011 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Paramount Madly clever animated sagebrush saga has style and wit to burn. TWITTER Johnny Depp voices the title character in a clever witty movie from his ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" director Gore Verbinski that employs a technique the filmmakers call ""emotion capture."" The dusty cards of the Old West are reshuffled into a winning hand in Rango a madly clever animated sagebrush saga with style and wit to burn. Reconfiguring the spaghetti Western into a fusilli con camaleonte Gore Verbinskis surprising escape picture after years in the Caribbean is eye-poppingly visualized in a hyper-realistic style that at times borders on the surrealist. The verbal flights of fancy will often sail right over the heads of rugrats as will the innumerable references to and twists on classic movies making this one animated feature some adults might enjoy more than their kids. But the presence of Johnny Depp in the title role virtually assures muscular returns for this Paramount/Nickelodeon production. Rango has the feel of a lark of a film-lovers spree in a playpen equipped with some of the worlds most expensive and expressive toys. Verbinski also enjoys the advantage of some highly gifted playmates including technical wizards at Industrial Light + Magic (working on the firms first animated feature) some of his Pirates effects cohorts and visual consultant Roger Deakins who helps make the picture look as much shot as animated. Unquestionably the first kids toon to feature a homage to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas within the first 10 minutes Rango pivots on the pilgrims progress of a mild-mannered pet chameleon who finds greatness thrust upon him when he pretends to a past of accomplished gunslinging in the name of justice. In the process he becomes sheriff of the dried-up desert town of Dirt which is presided over by a fat old tortoise who controls the ragged communitys water supply a situation that neatly allows the film to accommodate a child-friendly ecological theme while for buffs also summoning strong memories of Chinatown. That Rango has something different in mind from the general run of animated features is clear in the preliminary philosophical banter between Rango (Depp) a bulging-eyed chameleon whos normally blue and a Don Quixote-like armadillo (Alfred Molina) whose midsection has been flattened by a trucks wheel. The compositions especially in this stretch are imaginatively bizarre as are Rangos free-associative musings some of which go by so fast that its hard to take them all in. Ushered on his way through the arid landscapes by a mordant mariachi owl band Rango encounters female lizard Beans (Isla Fisher) with whom he stumbles upon the aptly named town of Dirt which is occupied by a wide range of vividly realized critters who share one thing in common Theyre all thirsty and cant hold out much longer without water. The wheelchair-bound seemingly genial old tortoise mayor who is voiced by Ned Beatty and looks like him too promises everyone that good times lie ahead and attempts to co-opt Rango who furthers his invented legend by killing a giant metal-beaked hawk by appointing him sheriff. While some distracting sideline villainy triggers some busy chases and battles the real bad guy is the mayor who has been hoarding water in preparation for the day when he will have bought up all the surrounding land for cheap. His henchman is the giant Rattlesnake Jake (Bill Nighy) memorably equipped with a rapid-fire Gatling gun where his rattle normally would be. But before Rango faces his high noon with the serpent he has an inspiring encounter with an iconic character called the Spirit of the West who bears an uncanny resemblance to an aged Man With No Name. When filmmakers who have never before worked in animation jump into the deep end the result could range from the freshly innovative to the downright clueless. In this case its happily the former that prevails. Screenwriter John Logan working from a story cooked up with Verbinski and the latters longtime illustrator and conceptual consultant James Ward Byrkit stirs the pot of genre archetypes conventions and cliches with a sharp eye for their amusing reusability while also writing flavorsome character dialogue. For his part the director has broken with convention by recording the vocal performances not separately in the isolation of studio booths but with the actors working together on a prop-laden and partly dressed stage for 23 days during which time their work was shot by HD cameras so that animators could later reference their facial expressions and bodily gestures for inspiration. There is evidence of this working more with some actors -- particularly Depp and Beatty -- than others but the verbal exchanges do spark and flow in the manner of accomplished ensemble work; in the promotional materials the filmmakers call the technique ""emotion capture"" as opposed to motion capture. But most exceptional is the visual style which makes even the best animated 3D look like a poor cousin. More than in any other animated work that comes to mind meticulous attention has been paid to light and shadow to gradations of color to details of faces costumes and props and to the framing of shots. Some of this is deliberately meant to ape the density of the compositions in certain classic Westerns and even more to those of Italian master Sergio Leone. Beyond this its arresting to behold the twists the filmmakers add such as creating a Monument Valley-like backdrop but deliberately changing its color from reddish to a sandy yellow or reducing the town in spots to what could be called its skeleton. Such imaginative leaps are perpetuated by Hans Zimmers score which reworks the sound of Ennio Morricones celebrated scores for Leone in ways that are exciting sometimes comic but never silly. A few off-color dialogue exchanges are mildly surprising for a family-friendly PG-rated film and dropping an additional five minutes or so would have tightened the screws to its benefit.
