Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet What do the James Bond series the Chicago Cubs and Master Ps No Limit empire have in common? All owe their considerable commercial success more to loyalty marketing and tradition than to quality. The last Bond movie 1997s Tomorrow Never Dies represented a steep drop in quality from the first Pierce Brosnan-as-Bond film GoldenEye and while The World Is Not Enough is a notable improvement the series continues to run on auto-pilot. As its conventional title would indicate Brosnans third outing as Bond isnt about to mess with a profitable formula. This time out his 007 has been dispatched to Russia to look after an oil heiress (Sophie Marceau) who may be the target of an anarchist terrorist (Robert Carlyle) immune to pain and not above sticking his hand on pieces of red-hot rock to prove it. As always minimal concessions to the passage of time are sprinkled throughout--the odd scratching on David Arnolds score nods to current events and the casting of drum-and-bass superstar Goldie as a minor baddie--but other than that not a whole lot has changed. Bond still manages to find a casino in the least likely of locations he still beds every woman worthy of a Maxim photo shoot and the villains still never kill him when given a chance. As in Tomorrow the filmmakers pair Brosnan with one respectable foreign actress (Marceau) and one chesty American so laughably awful that the film comes to a dead stop whenever shes on screen (Denise Richards). Richards plays a nuclear physicist this time out but you dont need to be one yourself to realize that her skimpily attired character seems a lot more like a San Diego aerobics instructor than a scientist. Enough fun moments are scattered throughout (many courtesy of Robbie Coltranes scummy Russian hustler returning from GoldenEye) to make The World Is Not Enough a decent Bond entry. But the series still needs a massive shot of fresh ideas if it wishes to become anything more than a nostalgia-fueled commercial sure thing.

But after two Austin Powers films spoofing the studly superspy and his nefarious nemeses we can probably agree that 007 served straight is tempting as a tepid martini.The World Is Not Enough the 19th installment in the film franchise inaugurated with Dr. No in 1962 is a case of Enough Already At least the Austin Powers comedies wring laughs out of the fact that the James Bond character is out of time and out of touch. This 007 movie isnt in on the joke.Because by the late 70s Bond had already devolved from surefooted sadist to smartly tailored mannequin it is old news to complain that Pierce Brosnan making his third appearance as Bond is an empty Brioni suit. Yet so pinched and clenched and positively humorless is Brosnan that he made me nostalgic for the labored grace and easy humor of Roger Moore.At least when Moore made a double-entendre you could see his tongue tickle the inside of his cheek. When Brosnan makes one of those puns more likely to make a 12-year-old girl cringe than blush he teases a pretty thing with a panatela saying ""Close but no cigar"" as though he means it literally.OK you argue we dont treasure Bond movies for the hero. We like them because they are catalogs of whats happening on the travel gadget and glamourpuss fronts.So I argue back While it is cool very cool that Bonds gleaming BMW looks like the mini-me version of the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao (both are titanium and both are tilted) what does it say when a movies inanimate props have more magnetism than the actors?While it is fun very fun to see Desmond Llewelyn for the billionth time as gizmo guru Q who here introduces a bullet-spewing bagpipe what does it say in this computer age that the best Bond gadgets are low-tech? While I particularly liked the helicopter outfitted with a vertical bank of circular saws (its ambidextrous it can decapitate horizontally with its rotor or vertically with its blades) its rare to encounter such a device outside a chainsaw-massacre film.And while it is saucy very saucy to see Sophie Marceau and Denise Richards - women whose pillow lips and frontal elevations have to be more effective hormonal boosts than Viagra - what does it say that Richards (as a physicist named Christmas Jones) delivers her dialogue phonetically?Enough is enough. Spoofing James Bond in the 90s may lack an original comic bite but making James Bond in the 90s is positively toothless.THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH  1/2 Produced by Michael G.

(MGM) Once all the world went gaga over James Bond. Now James Bond is going dada all over ""The World Is Not Enough."" Its true. The new Bond movie is pure nonsense art of the dadaist school; it follows the rules of the ridiculous as it turns narrative convention thriller formula and special-effects set pieces into a manifesto of the purest gibberish. To see it is to walk out of the theater scrambled wondering where in the hell you are if you are anyplace at all and even that is in doubt. It must be a giant joke played on us by those merry pranksters at MGM. Or perhaps Pierce Brosnan is angry that his excellent remake of ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" made so small a dent at the box office that he has decided to give the public what he thinks is appropriate to its IQ two hours of splosions and speedboats and machine guns arranged randomly lacking beginning middle or even end or any connective tissue while spotlighting some of the most vapid dialogue and some of the most vacant performances in history. Its pure dada as revolutionary in its way as Marcel Duchamps stunt of painting a mustache on the ""Mona Lisa"" to stun the bourgeoisie. It seems to be about--stop me if youve heard this one before--the ace stud of the British Secret Service being sent as a bodyguard for the recently orphaned daughter--unaccountably French--of a British oil billionaire who is trying to fulfill her fathers dream of building an oil pipeline along the southern route out of Azerbaijan Yes. Youre supposed to root for the pipeline builders who are seen rounding up peasants at gunpoint Now as no one would or could believe this its clearly a joke. Then halfway through when that story has lost what little steam it had--largely on account of Sophie Marceaus impenetrable accent and Robert Carlyles limp impersonation of an anarchist who believes only in disorder (he would have changed his mind if hed read the script)--the movie starts all over again. This time its a parody of the George Clooney non-hit ""The Peacemaker"" about terrorists who steal a nuclear warhead from a Russian missile silo for deployment against the West. The two stories are only marginally connected and how Cmdr. Bond walks from one into the other is a mystery that only Scully and Mulder could solve. But the second story at least has the spectacle of Denise Richards in her astonishing performance. (""Astonishing""--Hunter The Post.) I am sure this young American woman is a terrific human being a good citizen and can really dance well but as an actress she gives a tree slug a run for its money in the expression category. Admittedly shes made to say stupid things but she says them so dim-bulbishly with such lightless eyes and in such a childish monotone that you wonder if her parents knew where she was. Putting her in this movie seems almost like child abuse. Meanwhile Brosnan is walking about as if he hasnt noticed hes in the picture show. He can barely be bothered to read his lines. The performance is mainly a matter of displaying the fit of his suits. We all understand that the only remaining part of Bonds retro charm is his coolness his refusal to ruffle but has anyone put a mirror under Pierces nostrils recently? Whats his pulse rate -32? Has it been ascertained beyond a doubt that he is actually alive? Is this some stunt of cryogenics the first movie star to get through an entire performance while biologically frozen solid as a cod? Even the gags seem lackluster this umpteenth time through. The opening speedboat chase through London--by the way when did London become Venice and did it make the front page?--is pretty tame unless you get excited by splashing and a bit where guys in snowmobiles with parachutes chase downhill a 22-year-old stunt skier dressed sort of but not very much like Bond. Worst of all is a ride through the pipeline in some kind of vague contrivance that looks like the pneumatic tubes from old-time newsrooms when they sent remakes down to composing in the last few minutes before deadline. I kept waiting for a big hand to reach in pull him out and yell ""New Page One for the Five-Star"" It does get a little better at the end with Bond and Richardss Dr. Christmas Jones (yes) fleeing up the shaft of a vertically implanted nuclear sub being chased by a wall of propane flame. But really. ""The World Is Not Enough"" shows that Bond has gotten shaky not stirring. The World Is Not Enough (128 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for phony movie violence and phony sexual innuendo.

Goes Out With A Whimper Not A Bang By Sharon Pian Chan      Seattle Times Staff Reporter Movie review XX ""The World is Not Enough"" starring Pierce Brosnan Sophie Marceau Robert Carlyle Denise Richards and Judi Dench. Directed by Michael Apted from a script by Neal Purvis Robert Wade and Bruce Feirstein. 128 minutes. Several theaters. Rated R. You always hurt the ones you love. Thats James Bonds problem with women. Save the world? Or save the girl? Now Ive been given the choice. Save ""The World . . .""? Or save the audience? Sorry James. ""The World . . ."" is quite literally not enough. Somebody opened a can of weak sauce on this movie. This is the worst of the Brosnan Era. (For a more detailed debate about old Bond vs. new Bond see accompanying story). And yet Bond is still better than your average Bruce Willis action flick. All the key elements we look for in a 007 flick - the sultry babes the sharper-than-Sharper-Image gadgets the pulse-racing action scenes - theyre here. But theyre floating in this movie like soggy oyster crackers in a lukewarm bowl of beef stew. A few manage to shine. Brosnan is still as smooth as the vodka in his martini. Sophie Marceau floats as the oil princess minx. John Cleese is even fun to watch as Qs successor R although underused. And theres still that naughty Bond humor and the witty repartee between Bond and Moneypenny - which has gotten even better since Brosnan came on board. But the rest of the film lacks the luster of ""Goldeneye"" and the freshness of ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" Where is the brilliance of the bungee chord dive? The cajones to leap off a cliff to catch a falling plane? The classy spin-kicking Michelle Yeoh? After a muddled and dry beginning the plot follows the fortunes of an orphaned oil magnate played by Marceau whom Bond has been assigned to protect from bad guy Renard (Robert Carlyle). But the plot is inconsequential. The action sequences are decent; they just arent as clever as before. The opening scene the deft aperitif which is often the highlight of a Bond film drags. After a promising beginning with a hydrofoil shooting out of a building into the water it goes on . . . and on . . . and still on. The rest doesnt get any better another tired ski scene a silly chainsaw helicopter (you have to see it) closing chamber doors and explosions that play like a video game. Denise Richards is the worst actress to ever play the undemanding role of Bond girl. Not only is her name dumb - Christmas Jones - but dressed in her tank top and Daisy Duke shorts shes Nuclear Physicist Barbie delivering the line ""Im going to defuse a nuclear bomb"" as convincingly as a package of Pop Rocks. She makes Elizabeth Shue the giggly nuclear physicist from ""The Saint"" who hides the formula for cold fusion in her bra look positively Shakespearean. Robert Carlyle is vaguely stimulating as Renard the terrorist with a death sentence due to a bullet in his brain that has rendered him impervious to pain. A clever premise. But the final insult is the Dr. Evil makeup job. The gadgets are slightly worn. I never thought I would see the day when they would stoop to X-Ray glasses. And Bonds big inflatable jacket/ball (again you gotta see it) isnt even sexy. Even M (Judi Dench) the tough-as-nails boss has gone soft. Oh James. Even at your soggiest Id still rather have you over any other man. Im not looking for a commitment Im looking for a good time. Dont get me wrong - ""The World"" was fun - but youve failed to satisfy me. Copyright (c) 1999 Seattle Times Company All Rights Reserved.

"Jew Talkin to Me? Slate Sign In Sign Up Jew Talkin to Me? Jew Talkin to Me? Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 25 1999 330 AM Jew Talkin to Me? Liberty Heights fails to solve Barry Levinsons Jewish problem. Almodovar tells it straight in All About My Mother. By David Edelstein Liberty Heights Directed by Barry Levinson Warner Bros. All About My MotherDirected by Pedro Almodovar Sony Pictures Classics The World Is Not EnoughDirected by Michael Apted MGM Barry Levinson has said that his new movie Liberty Heights was born when a magazine critic made a breezily derisive reference to the Jewishness of Dustin Hoffmans character in Levinsons dud sci-fi picture Sphere (1998). Why he asked make an issue out of a characters ethnicity? The barbs of that (Jewish) critic dont seem like such a big deal to this (Jewish) critic but in Levinson they clearly touched a nerve. Trounced a nerve even. He has responded the way his teen-age alter ego Ben Kurtzman (Ben Foster) and friends respond in Liberty Heights when they defy a sign on a local pool that reads ""No Jews Dogs or Coloreds Allowed."" Hes saying ""You got a problem with Jewish? Ill show you Jewish"" Advertisement Does Levinson fully understand what teed him off? The charismatic young men in Diner (1982) his first autobiographical work (and his masterpiece) werent labeled as Jewish and its most memorable turns were by actors named Kevin and Mickey. In his third on-screen visit to his native Baltimore Avalon (1990) the milieu finally was Jewish but the director was more interested in making sweeping points about the cultural fragmentation of the central immigrant family--and by extension the American family--than in exploring his tribal or religious roots. (That family was impersonated by those Hebrews Aidan Quinn Elizabeth Perkins Armin Mueller-Stahl and Joan Plowright.) The point is Levinson airbrushed the Jewishness out of his movie memoirs and that review must on some level have shamed him--made him feel as if hed been dodging the issue. The problem I think is that hes still dodging the issue. Levinson might be so assimilated by now that he barely remembers what would impel someone to filter the Jewishness out of his or her autobiographical alter egos. On the basis of the family depicted in Liberty Heights he hardly seems to remember what a Jew is--only what a Jew is not. Its not a WASP. Its not an African-American. As a boy in the exclusively Jewish Liberty Heights section of Baltimore being Jewish was just being; it was when he perceived his ""otherness"" the movie suggests that a more complicated relationship to the world began. Thats what Liberty Heights attempts to recapture. The movie opens in 1954 when 16-year-old Ben first pokes his head out of his neighborhood and when desegregation is starting to bring together disparate ethnic and racial groups. Jews are not only interacting with WASPs and blacks; in the case of Ben and his older brother Van (Adrien Brody) theyre falling for them--much to the horror of the older generation both white and black. Ben takes a shine to a ""colored"" girl (Rebekah Johnson) who sneaks him into her (upper-middle-class) house and introduces him to rock n roll and to comedians who make fun of white people. Meanwhile Van and his buddies crash a Halloween party on the WASP side of town where Van goes gaga for a chill blonde goddess (Carolyn Murphy) in a fairy-godmother ensemble--the supreme shiksa. Even their dad Nate (Joe Mantegna) is forced to ally himself with non-Jews. The owner of a dying burlesque house whose side business the illegal numbers racket has become his lone source of income Nate loses a fortune to a small-time black drug dealer called Little Melvin (Orlando Jones)--a loose cannon who ultimately threatens his livelihood and his family. Levinsons remarks about the review of Sphere--which was released only last year--suggest something else about Liberty Heights that it was written fast.  That might not be a problem if its canvas werent so broad but Levinson doesnt work simply anymore. He wants to make an epic. So he spreads the narrative thin and the script plays like a first draft. Its full of wonderful bits that dont mesh (some of them could be spun off into their own movies) and with characters conceived either too coarsely or too vaguely. Little Melvin is a flaming racist outrage and I cant make any sense out of Trey (Justin Chambers) a glamorous rich WASP whos fond of crashing cars and who takes such a liking to Van that he appears to be foisting his girlfriend--the blonde goddess--on the Jew. Is this Aryan guilt or does he really want to jump Vans bones? No clue from the actors who look uniformly marooned. Advertisement The crosscutting among the movies various strands is even weirder. While Van and his buddies comb wealthy neighborhoods for a glimpse of his shiksa Nate auditions a stripper whose costume doesnt arrive and who ends up doffing her conservative street clothes on stage to wild acclaim. Is Levinson drawing a parallel here--saying that Jews are turned on by WASPs because theyre so buttoned-up? (I think alas he is.) And when he crosscuts between a James Brown concert and a WASP party is he saying that Jews are turned on by blacks because blacks are so unbuttoned--because they shake rattle and roll? (Ditto.) Is he saying that coming of age as a Jew means learning to embrace both chocolate and vanilla? In the end the narrator Ben retreats into generic memory-play mode ""If Id known things would no longer be Id have tried harder to remember them."" Loss of the past--thats a universal theme a ""gentile"" theme. The director has backed away from what appears to be his real more local theme which is the tug of war within American Jews of his generation between a compulsion to embrace other cultures and a feeling of superiority toward them. That idea is hilariously embodied by his best character Vans friend Yussel (David Krumholtz) who starts a brawl when he gets his nose rubbed in his Jewishness at one WASP party and shows up for the next with his hair dyed blond and with a tale of Nordic ancestry. I wish there were more of Yussel in Ben and Van who are both unforgivably wide-eyed and marshmallowy. Their blandness neuters what should be the movies reason for being. Liberty Heights is less gaseous than Avalon. The Jewish boys exploration of life among the ""other kind"" is often wryly funny and when they show up at the familiar Baltimore diner to compare notes time stops and we bask in their banter. If I sound sour compared with other critics its because I think Levinson missed a chance to get something unique and audacious on screen the story of a thin-skinned Jewish kid whod grow up to make autobiographical movies that somehow leave out the Jewishness and then get so enraged by a critics offhand projection of Jewishness into a big WASPy sci-fi picture that he vows to go back and remake his other films with Jews instead of gentiles. That would be something to see. C ritics have been falling all over themselves to announce that All About MyMother marks Pedro Almodovars arrival as a mature world-class director. Not to take anything away from his movie--its a lovely work--but Almodovar arrived as a world-class director 15 years ago when his silly campy and impassioned melodramas were like joyous dances on Gen. Francos tomb. His new work is his most sober maybe because his alter ego--an 18-year-old devoted son aspiring writer and worshipper of flamboyant actresses--gets run over by a car while chasing an actress (whod just played Blanche DuBois) for her autograph. This shocking act of self-effacement paves the way for a film suffused by the boys loss. His grief-stricken mother (Cecilia Roth) goes off in search of the father the boy never met--now an AIDS-ridden transvestite in Barcelona--and ends up at the center of a benign matriarchal society that includes the very actress (Marisa Paredes) that her son was pursuing. Advertisement The film has been consciously devised as the flip side of All About Eve (1950)--as a tale of women not bitchily at one anothers throats but holding one another together through lifes most senseless tragedies. (The definition of women here is broad enough to include transvestites and transsexuals.) Things that might once have been screamingly campy are now played ""straight"" People dramatize their emotions but rarely overdramatize them. And even though the film is full of laughs the jokes hover on the edge of the abyss This is a world in which lurid colors and extravagant gestures are means of filling the void. Almodovars movies are the transparent reveries of a gay star-struck adolescent. Most of us have equivalent fantasies but wed be ashamed to expose ourselves by putting them out there. Almodovar--even here in his square Douglas Sirk mode--gives them the kind of soul that banishes embarrassment. Im embarrassed to admit it but Pierce Brosnan is growing on me. Ian Flemings James Bond was a snob and a lightweight. It was only Sean Connerys peculiar combination of traits--he could seem rugged and snooty at once--that made us think 007 a more interesting character than he was. In The World Is Not Enough Brosnan brings the right Flemingesque irritation to the opening chase. Unlike Roger Moore who seemed detached from the action (as well as from his stunt double) and Timothy Dalton who seemed above it Brosnan makes you believe that Bonds absurd feats are the plausible upshot of his refusal to be bested by social or sexual inferiors. The actor is still sleek but the touch of crepe paper around his face has eliminated the plastic department-store-mannequin look that Remington Steele exploited so shrewdly. Hes vulnerable now You dont want his sewn-on suit to get wrinkled because fine tailoring appears to be all this man has. He even winces in pain a couple of times and in the climax lets out a grunt that takes the Bond girl (the dire Denise Richards) aback. The movie is better than youve heard although thats not saying a lot. I confess I always want to like the latest Bond flick. I have a Pavlovian reaction to the pre-title black-white-and-red bit with Monty Normans theme and the gun site roving over the latest 007 as he saunters to the center of the frame--I go ""Kill em Bond"" Much has been made of hiring Michael Apted to bring a more human touch to the series. Theres only so much a director can do with the most ironclad formula in movies but Apteds documentary instincts give the eastern European locations more personality and the dialogue scenes arent as choppy as usual Brosnan and his co-stars actually get a rhythm going. Theres even a rare performance from one of the ""Bond girls"" Sophie Marceau as a damsel in distress who turns out to be very distressed--psychologically--by a previous kidnapping attempt. Plus she has a long rounded chin that I find mysteriously intoxicating. The filmmakers drop the ball though on their master villain Renard who has a bullet in his brain that renders him impervious to physical pain. Robert Carlyle is a wonderful (and frightening) actor but the movie pumps him up to be such a terminator--""his only goal is chaos and he grows stronger every day until he dies""--that when this little guy comes shambling on and turns out to be such a soulful twit the movie loses all its credibility. Apted might be too much of a humanist for a Bond picture. Its not so bad that the blows arent heavily amplified but when the bad guys get it there isnt that extra sadistic beat to let you know how surprised they are that their aura of invincibility has been punctured.

Comments The World Is Not Enough ""James Bond will return"" says the closing title of this somewhat better than average 007 adventure but the bottom line is that hes never been away. The cold war may be dead and buried but British intelligence needs to be kept busy even if this means--as the script briefly and wittily suggests--creating its own enemies. With an appropriately imperialistic title (does it apply to the villains or to Anglo-American intelligence? does it matter?) a better than average director (Michael Apted) and locations ranging from Spain to Azerbaijan to Turkey this keeps one reasonably amused titillated and brain-dead for a little over two hours. The principal Bond babes this time around are Sophie Marceau and Denise Richards not counting Judi Dench as Bonds boss; Bruce Feirstein and Michael France had something to do with the script (1999 127 min.).

Although not without its moments particularly an exciting pre-credits high-speed boat chase and some solid work by the nicely matched Pierce Brosnan and Sophie Marceau 19th assignment of Bonds 37-year screen career sees 007 undone by villainous scripting and misguided casting and acting in a couple of key secondary roles. ""The World Is Not Enough"" and neither is this new entry in the James Bond cycle. Although not without its moments particularly an exciting pre-credits high-speed boat chase and some solid work by the nicely matched Pierce Brosnan and Sophie Marceau 19th assignment of Bonds 37-year screen career sees 007 undone by villainous scripting and misguided casting and acting in a couple of key secondary roles. Underachievement will probably only occasion a moderate B.O. dip for the series (first two Brosnan starrers ""GoldenEye"" and ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" grossed a series-best 353 million and 345 million worldwide respectively) but it should put producers on notice to do better next time around. Daft over-crammed plotting is a shame because Brosnan grows noticeably more comfortable in the role with each outing and here reveals a strong urge to make the most of his admittedly scant opportunities to invest Bond with interesting shadings and substance. The secret agent this time has an appealing vulnerable side not only a physical one in the form of a dislocated collar bone but in a growing susceptibility to Marceaus character who is more his match than any woman hes met in quite a while. There is a palpable sense of strain in the script to come up with new set piece ideas and one of the problems is that there are too many of them. But its impossible to take issue with the opening which at 15 minutes must rate as the longest Bond prologue ever. Set in Bilbao Spain for the sole and entirely justifiable reason of using Frank Gehrys new Guggenheim Museum as scenery story launch has Bond come to collect a large stash of money recovered from a killed MI6 agent. After 007 narrowly escapes death there he returns to London with the loot only to see its rightful owner blown up sending Bond into a wild chase aboard a jet speedboat on the Thames that winds up -- where else? -- on top of the new Millennium Dome at Greenwich. Its an exhilarating sequence one that sets up expectations that are unfortunately not matched on the rest of the trip. The man with the money it turns out was a wealthy industrialist whose daughter Elektra (Marceau) will now inherit his vast holdings which include an unfinished oil pipeline across Western Asia to Istanbul. Elektra also has a history with Bonds boss M (Judi Dench) who botched a rescue attempt of the young woman when she was held by a terrorist kidnapper from whom Elektra subsequently escaped. As Elektra seems a likely target of any number of rivals in the former Soviet Union Bond heads for the picturesquely ugly oil fields of Azerbaijan to protect her which he needs to do the moment she takes him skiing and theyre attacked by machine-gunning marauders in airborne parahawks that become speedy snowmobiles once theyve landed. A visit to the casino in Baku enables James not only to order a martini but also to try out some nifty X-ray specs that not only permit him to see that nearly everyone there is packing but also to check out the ladies undergarments. Its one of the films cleverest little inventions one that could have been judiciously built into a nice running gag. But just as James and Elektra find one another her old tormentor the terrorist Renard (Robert Carlyle) turns up. Not only are his plots now infinitely more dastardly but he has nothing to lose -- a bullet deeply lodged in his brain which will one day kill him has severed nerves so that he feels no pain and it also makes him stronger. Unlike the see-through glasses this scripting brainstorm seems not so clever making Renard too much of a freaky sci-fi character and saddling the gifted Carlyle with a silly role that is more annoying than imposing in the best Bond tradition. Much further beyond the pale however is ""Starship Troopers"" and ""Wild Things"" bimbette Denise Richards in the role she was born to play -- a high-level nuclear weapons expert. Prancing around a rugged work site in regulation nuke scientist shorts and midriff-revealing shirt Richards tries to look all business but cant be anything but what she is the token Yank in the cast cluelessly flailing about and certainly unable to hold her own with her more mature co-stars. Nonetheless shes asked to be convincing at disarming a nuclear warhead while hurtling with Bond through an oil pipeline at express speed. Even within the fantasy context of the Bond world nearly everything about her character is a joke including her name Christmas Jones which at least provides whats needed for the films groaningly funny sign-off line. Action grows murky and rather tiresome in the second half with at least one set piece too many -- pic is far too infatuated with a pair of buzz-saw-dragging helicopters -- and excessive liberties taken with Bond invisibly transporting himself from one remote location to another in the blink of an eye. M is intriguingly brought to the site of the suspense climax in Istanbul only to be cast aside in a cell. A major opportunity is missed in not having her execute the coup de grace to one of the villains (which would have made much more psychological and emotional sense) instead of Bond. Final combat aboard a submerged nuclear sub merely demonstrates once again that water puts a literal damper on action sequences. While Bond buffs had widely speculated what a name director like Michael Apted might add to the proceedings the answer is very little. Staging of the dramatic sequences is capable but straightforward although it is possible that Apted might have urged Brosnan in the encouraging direction indicated here. As Rene Russo did in ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" Marceau squares off very nicely opposite the star displaying a confident ease in English-lingo thesping. Robbie Coltrane reprises the Sidney Greenstreetish role of the rotund criminal businessman Valentin Zukovsky that he originated in ""GoldenEye"" while the usual MI6 crowd is back along with the surprising addition of a cheeky John Cleese as R the assistant and heir apparent of the ancient Desmond Llewelyns ever-inventive Q. ""World"" has the customary Bond look and sound which represent cozy satisfactions unto themselves. The World Is Not EnoughProductionAn MGM release of an Albert R. Broccolis Eon Prods.

Starring Pierce Brosnan Sophie Marceau Robert Carlyle and Denise Richards. Directed by Michael Apted. (PG-13. 130 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""The World Is Not Enough"" is the James Bond movie that proves that its possible in the 19th installment of the series for the hero to say ""My name is Bond James Bond"" and have it not seem silly. Its the movie that proves that Bond can order his martini ""shaken not stirred"" without people in the audience feeling the impulse to elbow each other. Its just a man ordering a drink. Making a James Bond movie in 1999 requires lots of juggling. ""The World Is Not Enough"" which opens today does the juggling and finds the right balances. The result is a thoroughly satisfying completely entertaining film thats also rather surprisingly an emotionally full experience. Heres one example of what makes this picture work Bond movies require ""Bond girls"" so this one gives us Denise Richards as believe it or not a nuclear scientist. With her wet T-shirt smart banter and ridiculous name -- ""Christmas Jones"" -- she enters a tradition inhabited by other memorably named yet interchangeable characters such as Pussy Galore and Holly Goodhead. But the movie also gives us a Bond woman who is no girl. As Elektra an oil magnate targeted for assassination Sophie Marceau plays a role that a man would have played 30 years ago -- and what a waste that would have been. The charm and mischief of Marceaus performance is a big part of the films appeal. Another plus is the moment-to-moment honesty of Michael Apteds direction not to mention Pierce Brosnan who in this third installment must be acknowledged as one of the best Bonds. Back-to-back action sequences start the movie and each is more inventive than ones found in other action films. In the first Bond is in a small room surrounded by armed men who are pointing guns at him. No problem. The other is a chase scene done with speedboats. Somehow the chase never seems generic but intrinsically Bond-like. The story is pure nonsense but it goes by too quickly to notice. More important the characters act as if they believe the story with no winking at the audience. Bond is sent to the Middle East to protect Elektra (Marceau) whose life is being threatened by Renard a terrorist played by Robert Carlyle. Renard has a neurological problem. He was shot in the head and has lost his sense of taste and touch. He is as a result like Superman -- or at the very least like Al Pacino at the end of ""Scarface"" -- impervious to both pain and pleasure. In the hands of a less gifted director Renard could have been a cartoon villain but Apted (""Blink"") is too sensitive to go for the cheap effect. Though the circumstances may be cartoon-like Apted has his actors invest their characters with all their passion. Renard becomes a tragic figure a man unable to kiss his lover and feel it. Carlyle walks like one of the living dead exuding a sad dislocation. Apted works the same magic with Marceaus performance. The French actress who was beautiful but pastel in her previous American films could have played Elektra as a one-note vixen. But Marceau plays her -- a victim of kidnapping and torture -- as a psychologically complex woman. ""The World Is Not Enough"" provides all the usual attractions. Bond goes skiing which is an occasion for assassins to drop hand grenades on him. There are gadgets double entendres stolen warheads and vivid characters. Judi Dench plays M with authority. Robbie Coltrane is a pleasure as a Russian gangster. That a Bond movie should be amusing is expected but that it should linger in the mind is the surprise here. ""The World Is Not Enough"" is one of the few films in the series in which one feels Bonds mental strain. Bond is a killer. He has to live with that and its not always easy. Though he may look as smooth as Roger Moore Brosnan gives us a Bond who is capable but emotionally scarred. ..

With Pierce Brosnan Denise Richards Sophie Marceau Judi Dench. Directed by Michael Apted. Running time 128 minutes. At area theaters. Rated PG-13 Violence brief nudity. 3 STARS You cant go too wrong with the James Bond formula of action sex intrigue and groaners as long as you have a Bond who can take a licking (or give one) and keep on ticking. Pierce Brosnan in his third such outing cuts a fine figure of a Bond in the new ""The World Is Not Enough"" No. 19 in the Agent 007 hit parade. Brosnan looks poised groomed and qualified for that legendary license to kill. Plus his haberdashery is always perfect. The first half hour of the movie is a spectacular display of stunts and adrenaline beginning with a swipe at Swiss bankers and a risky leap from a window ledge moving on to a warp-speed hydroboat chase that finishes up with pure Bondian logic on a hot-air balloon. You dont have to wait long hoping there will be a little something on skis when voila Bond and a comely oil heiress (Sophie Marceau) vault from a helicopter onto the white stuff and after much extreme footwork get buried in an avalanche. What more could you ask? Well maybe less. With a running time of just over two hours ""The World Is Not Enough"" gives if anything more than the senses can process. There is just so much derring-do explosions and plot developments before ones brain begins to leak. Youre likely to feel as benumbed as the storys villain (Robert Carlyle) a terrorist who feels no pain because of a brain anomaly. Bond makes full use of his passport in this story of an oil pipeline and the fate of the Western world. Locations include any country whose name is difficult to spell. Our hero travels fully loaded with his arsenal of special equipment supplied by Q (Desmond Llewelyn) and Qs new scion R (John Cleese). The gadgets are reliably jokey; my favorite is a pair of X-ray specs like those advertised in old bubblegum wrappers. They allow Bond to see right through exactly one layer of womens clothing and no further. Despite a fractured collarbone that does not in the slightest hamper his love life Bond buries himself in his work and in Elektra King (Marceau of ""Braveheart"") whose oil baron dad has just been done in by a pile of exploding money. Mourning becomes Elektra. Bond meets the grieving daughter at her dads funeral and she arouses in him an urge to relieve her of all cares and woe and clothing. Marceau that French morsel generates enough heat with Brosnan to cauterize a wound. Unfortunately Denise Richards is a disappointment as a second Bond girl. Although its endearing that she plays a nuclear physicist who wears tank tops and micro-shorts to handle plutonium the dialogue confounds her. Dont ask her to say ""catastrophic meltdown"" three times fast. Perhaps the joke is that Bond unrepentant letch that he is can still have his bimbos as long as they sport a Ph.D. and little else. Theres a very obvious plot twist involving M (Judi Dench) that seems to have gotten lost in the shuffle; perhaps director Michael Apted scrapped exposition in favor of sheer dazzle. Anyway thats what Bond is all about dazzle some really bad puns and the kind of sexy fun that satisfies high-school urges while masquerading in tux and tails.

"A Bond `World - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Movies.A Bond `WorldSomethings Missing From The Latest 007 Adventure `The World Is Not Enough -- Despite Its Thrilling Action Sequences Picturesque Settings And Gadgets GaloreNovember 19 1999|By Michael Wilmington Tribune Movie Critic.`The World Is Not Enough"" seems a rather chancy even potentially vainglorious title even for a new James Bond movie. But for 15 roaring pre-title minutes the 19th official onscreen adventure of the licensed-to-kill superspy really lives up to it.Our man Bond played for the third time by cool natty Pierce Brosnan collects some swag near the Guggenheim museum in Bilbao Spain and then gets hurled into one of the longest and best Bond pre-credits sequences ever a complex set of shoot-outs and high-speed chases in Spain and London mostly involving two motorboats on the Thames and a hot-air balloon -- all triggered by a terrorist-assassin lovely known as The Cigar Girl. played by smoky Maria Grazia Cucinotta. The scene ends with a bang fittingly on the new Greenwich Millennium Dome.Great stuff. But the rest of the movie doesnt quite live up to that opening even though the producers have assembled a top cast and crew and repeated all the familiar moves exotic locales colorful and sadistic supervillain good girl-bad girl comradely byplay with M Q and all the British espionage elite gang and a rocker-socker title song (by Garbage).There are also of course action and gadgets galore and picturesque settings -- from Bilbao to Azerbaijan Istanbul and the Caspian Sea. More important theres an interesting international cast headed by brainy French temptress Sophie Marceau as sultry heiress Elektra King and ""The Full Montys"" Robert Carlyle as melancholy super-terrorist Renard. Some of the others second Bond Girl Christmas Jones (played by ex-teen queen Denise Richards) evil heavies Bull (composer-artist Goldie) and Davidov (Ulrich Thomsen) and back for his second Bond go-round the jocular Russian bon vivant from ""GoldenEye"" swinging Valentin Zukovsky (Robbie Coltrane).To top it all off new director Michael Apted (""Coal Miners Daughter"" and the ""7UP"" documentary series) is the most talented moviemaker to do this series since Lewis Gilbert (""You Only Live Twice"" ""The Spy Who Loved Me"").But then theres the script. The story from the screenwriting team of Neal Purvis and Robert Wade (""Let Him Have It"") is unusually complex -- maybe even over-complex. To keep a lid on a few surprises well say that it involves an Asian oil pipeline being constructed to Istanbul by Elektra and a dizzying network of schemes to exploit or destroy it. Underneath it all an undercurrent of past bloodshed involving Elektra her father and the conscience-ravaged M played by Judi Dench -- who actually shows up in Azerbaijan for part of the action (no doubt a trip inspired by Denchs Oscar for ""Shakespeare in Love"").As always the film races along like a glamorous express train speeding through an air raid laced with Bonds machismo with the bad guys and innuendoes with the ladies. Apted has been able to get much more weight and dramatic depth than usual -- though hes defeated by the presence of Richards in what may be a classic piece of misguided off-type casting. The saucy Richards in shorts and T-shirt plays Dr. Christmas Jones hyper-active nuclear physicist for hire.Even so as someone whos seen each new Bond since 1963s ""Goldfinger"" -- still the best -- my hopes were primed especially coming after the dismally overblown and comically challenged excesses of 1997s ""Tomorrow Never Dies."" But though ""World"" is a distinct improvement over ""Tomorrow"" its not up to the best Bonds of yesterday. After that smash opening it never hits the right balance of sex and violence adventure and comedy. Theres something missing -- some of the old snap style and impudence -- and I suspect the culprit is partly the rating system.Why should a movie about James Bond -- one of the main 20th Century symbols of sex and violence -- be PG-13?Like its immediate predecessors ""World"" is conceived as a wide-audience movie albeit a randy and violent one full of sanitized kiss-kiss-bang-bang. But the entire essence of Bond is thats hes a serial seducer with a license to kill from his government. Hes a fantasy figure of massive political incorrectness whose roots lie in the immediate Cold War era when Ian Fleming first wrote the books and the 60s sexual revolution when the movie formula was set by screenwriter Richard Maibaum and others. Brosnan himself has suggested the series needs more -- or more intense -- sexuality and violence and I think hes right.Of course Bond has changed. In fact one of the reasons Brosnan is so good in the role -- easily the best 007 since Sean Connery -- is that he suggests more vulnerability even anguish beneath Bonds crisp hip surface. Brosnans Bond is supposed to be playing through pain here He suffers a shoulder injury in that opening brouhaha and returns too soon. And hes caught in a more perverse sexual tangle than usual. (The classic Fleming Bond plot had 007 stealing the super-villains mistress or seducing the enemy agent very different from what happens here.)1 | 2 | Next MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Life Skill 201 Washing a baseball capLongtime nursing home operators must face trial judge rules10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesMovies Bond Movies Deconstructing The 22 007 FilmsNovember 19 2006Royale collections of Bonds by the boxNovember 10 2006`Bubble stirs up HollywoodJanuary 27 2006Fall Spotlight On . . .

(MGM) In ""The World Is Not Enough"" Pierce Brosnans James Bond is starting to look a tad long in the tooth. And it looks as though Desmond Llewelyns ""Q"" is taking his final bow. But dont worry. Pierce probably has another Bond in him. And Qs replacement looks to be none other than - well lets just say ""Now its time for someone completely different."" But personnel changes no matter how significant will never stop the eternal Bond factory. If therell always be an England therell always be a Bond. Hence this bold declarative sentence at the end of the movie ""James Bond will return."" In fact Bond flicks have returned steadily since 1962 when a young Sean Connery (the first Bond for those of you unaware of the series original Agent 007) beheld the salty-wet bikini-clad Ursula Andress - name of Honey Ryder - emerging from the sea in ""Dr. No."" In ""The World Is Not Enough"" little has changed in more than 36 years. Denise Richards who has built her career as a nubile sex symbol without too much gray matter is now Bonds latest pinup ally as Christmas Jones. Shes hardly the worlds greatest actor either. But were meant to believe shes a nuclear weapons expert. ""The World Is Not Enough"" which has something to do with the possible destruction of the Western worlds biggest oil pipeline oozes over with plot. In addition to Christmas Jones Bond (Brosnan in his third appearance) crosses paths with oil heiress Elektra King (Sophie Marceau) sinister terrorist Renard (Robert Carlyle) and double agent Valentin (Robbie Coltrane). And of course Her Majestys best agent attends the usual round of office meetings with Q (Llewelyn) and M (Judi Dench). Making sense of Bond scenarios was never the point. The movie like its 18 predecessors is all about the sideshow. (Okay Bondistas Im not counting those unofficial Bond films like ""Never Say Never Again."") Were talking about girls gadgetry villains international hot spots and last but not least saucy dialogue. ""Would you like to check my figures?"" an attractive woman asks Bond as he attends a significant meeting with a shady Swiss banker. Naturally shes referring to the financial records in her hands. And naturally so is Bond when he replies ""Oh Im sure theyre perfectly rounded."" Ill spare you the exchange between Bond and Miss Moneypenny (Samantha Bond) on the subject of cigars. The fact is this is an enjoyable formula. ""The World Is Not Enough"" is simply a visit to familiar territory with that martini - shaken not stirred - waiting at some out-of-the-way international bar. Theres a thrilling and wonderfully implausible boat race on the Thames. Theres a joyride on the nose of an atomic bomb racing through a pipeline in Turkey. Theres a great bungee stunt in Bilbao. And theres skiing in Azerbaijan. There is always skiing it seems. And as we watch footage of two stuntmen pretending to be Bond and Elektra streaking down the slopes we have to pretend its really actors Brosnan and Marceau. And when the stars pause to catch their breath after a strenuous downhill run - their hair still perfectly coiffed - we smirk to ourselves. This is the world of James Bond; and if we dont believe the whole fantasy will plunge into a crevasse. THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH (PG-13 128 minutes) - Contains obscured nudity extensive machine-gun deaths and risque dialogue. Area theaters.

A Traditional Bond - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Bond A Traditional BondMOVIES - MOVIE REVIEWThe Latest Spy Adventure Emphasizes 007 Mythology But Doesnt Scrimp On ActionNovember 19 1999|By Jay Boyar Sentinel Movie CriticThe World Is Not Enough is almost too much.Unlike Tomorrow Never Dies - its sleek immediate predecessor - the latest 007 extravaganza has enough plot developments double-entendres emotional underpinnings and of course Bond girls action scenes and explosions to furnish at least a couple of Bondfests with plenty left over for an episode of Nash Bridges.I dont have room to offer more than the briefest summary of the labyrinthine plot of this two-hour-plus presentation which takes Bond (Pierce Brosnan) from Spain to London to Azerbaijan to Istanbul to various photo ops near the Caspian Sea.This time Ian Flemings dapper uber-agent finds himself attempting to protect a young oil heiress whose father had been a close friend of Bonds boss the ironical M (Judi Dench).It seems that that heiress a beauty named Elektra (Sophie Marceau) had once been abducted by the fiendish Renard (Robert Carlyle) who may be after her again. Theres also something in there about a crucial oil pipeline which explains why the gyrating nude models of the opening-credits sequence are slathered in a viscous black liquid.The World Is Not Enough is a departure from Tomorrow Never Dies among the most popular and least Bondlike film of the series. Of course the 1997 movie contained all the Bond trademarks but they were downplayed. In most ways the film was indistinguishable from the sort of action flick that might star Bruce Willis or Harrison Ford.But if Tomorrow Never Dies was generic it was also fast exciting and very much of its moment.In The World Is Not Enough the 19th official installment of the series director Michael Apted (Extreme Measures) and his screenwriting team re-emphasize Bond myth- othogy. Not only is M a big part of the plot but the film also contains two government gadget gurus the retiring Q (Desmond Llewelyn) and his replacement R (Monty Pythons John Cleese).And 007s signature phrase ``Bond. James Bond is spoken not once but three times - twice by the spy himself and once by a casino owner (Robbie Coltrane).As a result the new film (which opens today) is apt to be most appreciated by true-blue Bondites. To others it might seem solid but a bit familiar and overstuffed like a favorite old chair that has begun to show its age.Even so Apted has a flair for action scenes. He keeps these swift and clear whether the sequence has Bond pursuing evildoers on land at sea in the air or all three.Brosnan continues to fill out the starring role with such flinty panache that his only real rival is the original Bond Sean Connery. Tops among the new Bond girls are Marceau (Braveheart) who does troubled and delicate well and Denise Richards (Starship Troopers) who plays a feisty midriff-baring nuclear expert named Dr. Christmas Jones.``I thought Christmas only comes once a year quips 007 after an extended intimate encounter with the scientist. As I say there is a great deal of this interplay although the screenwriters somehow missed out on the chance to come up with a double-entendre about that pipeline.But they dont miss much else in The World Is Not Enough a double scoop of double-0 seven and then some.

"Bonds Complexity More Than Enough - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMovie Review Bonds Complexity More Than EnoughNovember 19 1999|KEVIN THOMAS | TIMES STAFF WRITER ""The World Is Not Enough"" the 19th James Bond movie is in the ""Mission Impossible"" tradition It presents action adventure and romance with maximum sophistication and spectacle and minimal clarity.Director Michael Apted and his writers admirably maintain a balance between complexity of character and special effects only to undercut their impact with a murky narrative. This sleek fast-paced entertainment is further evidence of a steady erosion of confidence in the power of storytelling for its own sake on the part of contemporary blockbuster filmmakers and truth to tell that audiences may have trouble following the plot probably wont make a dent at the box office.A pre-credit jaw-dropping sequence is de rigueur for the Bonds and ""World"" delivers big time with Pierce Brosnans Agent 007 in a terrific speedboat chase down the River Thames that culminates with the suspect attempting to escape via balloon and Bond landing on top of Londons Millennium Dome. Through a series of sequences each one a triumph of production design and technical bravura we gather that Bond has been sent by M (Judi Dench) to Bilbao Spain to retrieve a ransom payment paid by an oil tycoon Sir Robert King (David Calder) to rescue his kidnapped daughter Elektra (Sophie Marceau) from the arch anarchist Renard (Robert Carlyle) whose only goal it seems is to create chaos.But when Sir Robert comes to MI6 headquarters in London to collect his money a fiendish device blows him to bits. Bond is off to Baku Azerbaijan to keep a protective eye on Elektra who is carrying on her fathers ambitious and perilous task of building an oil pipeline across Western Asia to Istanbul so that in the words of M ""the West can count on oil reserves for the next century.""As a survivor of a kidnapping Elektra is seemingly as fearless as she is gorgeous not welcoming Bonds presence as a protector but eager to have him as a bedmate. He tries to resist but is beguiled by this beauty who soon proves to be complicated indeed. Bond begins suspecting that she may be a victim of the ""Stockholm syndrome"" secretly remaining in the thrall of Renard. But what if Renard in turn has fallen in love with her? Apted is adroit in suggesting the contradictions that riddle Elektra and others that render their behavior ambiguous at best.Similarly hes good at evoking an aura of complicity that governs interplay between the pursuer and the pursued revealing vulnerability in all of the films key players a quality that has become a must in screen heroes and villains alike. All this is to the good; Brosnan Marceau (whose 15 movies include ""Braveheart"" and some prestigious French pictures) and Britains ever-versatile Carlyle and Dench all have the talent and experience necessary in creating three-dimensional characters. But too often the filmmakers allow a concern for complexity of motivation to lapse into needless confusion.All the elements that audiences have come to expect of Bond pictures are securely in place fabulous gadgetry superbly photographed exotic locales stupendous production values inspired action sequences gorgeous women considerable zingy double-entendres a driving score that incorporates the familiar Bond theme and an overall feeling of tremendous-scale no-expenses-spared filmmaking.Robbie Coltrane reprises vividly bad-guy-turned-good-guy Valentin Zukovsky and John Cleese is on hand for some comic relief as R aide to series veteran Desmond Llewelyns Q MI6s inventor extraordinaire. But beautiful Denise Richards draws unintended laughs for her singularly callow portrayal of a nuclear weapons whiz. ""The World Is Not Enough"" in fact offers not enough to add up to a fully satisfying movie. MPAA rating PG-13 for intense sequences of action violence some sexuality and innuendo.

Brosnan bellies up to Richards C The World Is Not Enough Genre Action/Adventure; Starring Pierce Brosnan Robert Carlyle John Cleese Judi Dench Desmond Llewelyn Sophie Marceau Denise Richards; Director Michael Apted; Author Neal Purvis Robert Wade; Runtime (in minutes) 128; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Danjaq Posted November 26 1999 -- 1200 AM EST Thick slick black oil is a key prop in The World Is Not Enough the third James Bond outing to star Pierce Brosnan and the first in which viscous fluid exhibits more personality than the people who are killing each other over it. Not that it matters but Bonds ostensible assignment this time on special orders from M (long-lived English lioness Judi Dench) is to protect oil heiress Elektra King (long-lived French kitten Sophie Marceau) from Renard--just Renard (Robert Carlyle)--an international terrorist with a bullet in his brain that renders him impervious to pain. Of course no one is who he or she appears to be as Bond learns the hard way stunt-doubling through the usual flashy feats involving speedboats skis submarines and at one point an underground oil pipeline itself. At some outpost in his travels avec dinner jacket though Bond crosses paths once again with Valentin Zukovsky the charismatically corpulent casino operator and arms merchant who first raised the stakes in 007s world in Goldeneye. Once again Robbie Coltrane plays with unstinting Sydney Greenstreet dash. And every moment of Coltrane on screen is a moment more alive with pleasure than any involving Bond and his gizmos or Bond and his girls; Brosnans repertoire of eyebrow arching while ogling and jaw clenching while escaping is by now entirely without flavor. Which confirms a 007 theory of mine that the hero himself has been denatured for a young late 1990s audience with little appreciation for real suavity or sex play (the visual charms of Denise Richards as a nuclear-weapons expert who works best in tank tops dim every time she speaks in petulant Party of Five cadences). And that as a result the future of the Bond market--arrested as it is in The World Is Not Enough somewhere between the blockish durability of Baywatchs David Hasselhoff and the satiric commotion of Austin Powers Mike Myers--lies in giving more screen time to everyone but the spy and his gal pals. Director Michael Apted in his first swing at the franchise plays his strong backbench of British character actors for all theyre worth; theyre the pungent streak of blue cutting through the films cheese.

Directed by Michael Apted. Screenplay by Neal Purvis Robert Wade and Bruce Feirstein. Running time 128 minutes. Rated PG-13. At the Astor Plaza the First amp; 62nd the Olympia others. TOO many of the recent Bond movies seem to have been made by people who don""""t really ""get"" the whole Bond mystique; fortunately ""The World Is Not Enough"" (No. 19) comes closer to what a Bond movie should be and once was. Its terrific opening sequence - including a spectacular chase along the river Thames - is up there with the best Bond scenes. Apart from that the most gratifying thing about the film is that director Michael Apted and his writing team understand that James Bond isn""""t just another action hero to be squandered in the long shootouts that took up so much of the last two films ""Goldeneye"" and ""Tomorrow Never Dies."" Theres also less of the tiresome political correctness that came into the series with the charmless and humorless Timothy Dalton. Once again agent 007 is a properly promiscuous womanizer and when necessary a ruthless killer. On the other hand the punning lubricious humor that is a key part of the formula is weaker than it has been for years. Robert Carlyle (the psychopathic Begby in ""Trainspotting"") makes a surprisingly weak villain and the gadgetry provided by Q (Desmond Llewelyn who has been in the series for 40 years) and his heir John Cleese is mostly unimpressive. (Again Bond""""s auto isn""""t some wonderful British sports car but a BMW coupe). After British Intelligence fails to protect a powerful businessman from the vengeance of the terrorist Renard (Carlyle) Bond is sent to the Caspian oil town of Baku by M (Judi Dench) to make sure that the tycoon""""s gorgeous daughter Electra (Sophie Marceau) doesn""""t become his next victim. Electra is building a pipeline across Central Asia to Turkey a pipeline that many people would prefer remained unfinished. Assassins in motorized paragliders duly try to kill her when she and Bond are surveying the route on skis. Bond suspects one of Electra""""s employees of disloyalty and after shadowing him ends up at a Russian nuclear missile base in Kazakhstan. There he fails to prevent the theft of a nuclear warhead by Renard but meets Dr. Christmas Jones embodied by Denise Richards as one of those nubile scientists (Nicole Kidman """"""""The Peacemaker"""""""" Elizabeth Shue in ""The Saint"") who look terrific in a tank top and short shorts. The warhead then ends up in Istanbul as part of an evil scheme to destroy the city and the West""""s access to oil from the East. There are some big jagged gaps in the complicated and often confusing story - as if a whole subplot involving Judi Dench""""s M has been cut out. But it could just be bad writing that makes the film feel mutilated despite its length and complexity. The three screenwriters are after all responsible for some terrible lines that make Marceau and especially Richards seem even more bimbonic than necessary. It""""s a shame that director Apted (whose documentary ""42 Up"" opened this week) doesn""""t allow Brosnan the tough unflappability of Sean Connery""""s Bond - perhaps out of a misguided desire to make the spy a more well-rounded character - because Brosnan is growing more comfortable in the role. As his boyish face ages and his frame fills out he""""s becoming more appealing as a leading man and more convincing as the quietly tough superagent who""""s seen it all. The locations are as exotic as ever (although an Orthodox church turns up in a key scene in Muslim Azerbaijan) and well-photographed. The action scenes are top-notch even when they dont make much sense.

Charles Taylor Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Espionage Movies Entertainment News Probably nothing has done as much in recent years to make James Bond a figure of fantasy once again as the photo spread in the premiere issue of Talk magazine showing Rupert Everett as a bisexual Bond. The thought of an actor with Everetts wit and sexiness stepping into the role of 007 is enough to get you drooling. Cherish those fantasies. Theyll prove to be a hell of a lot more sustaining than the latest Bond adventure ""The World Is Not Enough.""If Bond long ago became part of your fantasy life or your pop iconography then the anticipation of a good Bond movie would probably survive even if ""The World Is Not Enough"" were worse than it is. But its not even up to the level of what used to be below par for the series (say ""Thunderball"" or ""Moonraker""); nor is it pleasantly diverting (""Octopussy""); and its not even in the same stratosphere as the peaks -- ""Goldfinger"" ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" ""On Her Majestys Secret Service"" or the best of the lot ""You Only Live Twice."" Its also not as bad as the last entry ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" possibly the worst-directed of all Bonds. But they share similar problems.Somewhere along the way the people behind the series stopped thinking of Bond movies as comic books for adults and began thinking of them as action movies. The sex and luxury quotient started taking a nosedive as the destructo quotient headed through the roof. ""The World Is Not Enough"" opens with a chase that progresses from land to water back to land and finally to air. Its frequently spectacular and yet not terribly distinctive; you respond more to the audacity of the idea than the execution. And youre aware of how the sequence is just an excuse for explosions and all sorts of destruction. Theres none of the clean efficiency you remember from the car chase through the nighttime woods in ""Goldfinger"" or the virtuoso ski and bobsled chases Peter Hunt devised for ""On Her Majestys Secret Service.""Perhaps the reason nearly every Bond movie now features a ski chase is that it lets the camera revel in the vistas of snow-covered space and allows for a visually uncluttered chase. The ski chase here is the movies visual high point as Pierce Brosnans Bond and Sophie Marceau playing the daughter of a hugely rich industrialist whos been murdered by terrorists are pursued by machine-gun-wielding snowmobiles that hover above them via black parachutes; appearing over the mountains these deadly machines look like some swarm of mutant mosquitoes.""The World Is Not Enough"" offers so little of the series Playboy fantasies of ""the good life"" -- swanky resorts and casinos lush uncomplicated sex -- that when the movie tosses you a little tidbit like a throwaway shot of the Frank Gehry-designed Guggenheim museum in Bilbao youre almost pathetically grateful. I think I counted one vodka martini going down Bonds gullet in this movie and he downs it fast as if hes racing to catch a bus. I was rather more encouraged when early on Bond seduces British Intelligences house doctor. I shouldnt have gotten my hopes up.On the tally sheet of recent Bond-inspired fantasies the casting of Denise Richards probably ranks right behind that Rupert Everett photo spread. Theres probably no other current movie actress who has roused as many pornographic longings as she has (at least among the straight men in the audience). The focus is invariably Richards fuller-than-full lips particularly the nasty little curl of her smile.When filmmakers take Richards dirty-girl appeal into account as John McNaughton did in the deliriously trashy ""Wild Things"" Richards practically squeals naughtiness. Here shes playing a nuclear weapons expert named Christmas Jones -- the launching pad for a few of the films better double-entendres -- and the movie seems practically afraid of making fun of the ridiculousness of that conceit. So Richards has to stand around trying to muster some authority while snapping off her lines and sounding more like a high school kid in a snit. Whats the point of casting Denise Richards in a Bond movie if not to make her into a sex fantasy? There are some obligatory shots of her wearing a tight white T-shirt in a submarine filling with water and the poverty of pornographic imagination they represent is rather appalling. Nearly as appalling is how long it takes for her and Brosnan to do anything -- even exchange racy repartee.Marceau whose smudged dewiness doesnt bring much to the party is another letdown. Marceaus Elektra (I guess her parents were inspired more by their old Doors albums than by Euripedes) is the focus of the movies rather dull plot. Shes trying to finish her late fathers pipeline while international terrorist Renard (Robert Carlyle) may be trying to destroy it. Complications ensue from Renards having once kidnapped Elektra who escaped by killing two of her captors. You Might Also Like Renard has been given a great bad-guy gimmick An unsuccessful assassination attempt has left a bullet in his skull that inures him to pain. And damned if the fool filmmakers dont do diddly with that either. Instead of giving us a super villain crazy-high on his own power and invincibility Carlyle looks as down in the mouth as a guy whos learned to live with terminal migraine. That glumness is appropriate though to the Elektra/Renard plot which is inappropriate for the fantasy tone of a Bond movie. When ""The World Is Not Enough"" isnt trying to win the Thanksgiving action movie sweepstakes its making half-hearted attempts to be a serious espionage fiction. And that was always the material that the Bond movies opposed.The movie does some things right and most of them are done by the supporting characters. Robbie Coltrane in a smashing series of lounge-lizard formal wear returns as the Russian mobster Zukovsky. With his deadpan understatement Coltrane exudes total corruption and revels in it.The recurring characters are given particularly nice bits. This is the first time Samantha Bond has made an impression as Miss Moneypenny (though nothing can keep me from pining for Lois Maxwell). Judi Denchs M has been given a bigger role to play the better for us all to bask in her authority. I cant think of another actor who could deliver the line ""We will follow them to the furthest ends of the Earth if need be and bring them to justice"" and not sound like a cardboard cutout. In a lovely nod to the actor who proceeded her in the role of M an oil portrait of Bernard Lee hangs over her desk.I wish there were more for Michael Kitchen as Ms assistant but someone had the very bright idea of casting John Cleese as the protigi of Desmond Llewelyns Q. Its an inspired choice They share the same dotty disdain. And Llewelyn has been given a charming fleeting scene with 007 where he seems to be taking the bow hes earned after 17 appearances and nearly 40 years in the series.Brosnans another matter. He could probably play Bond at a masquerade party or in a comedy sketch. But its almost about impossible to detect any of the characters cool sadism or sensual gusto or just plain dirty-mindedness in him. You dont even get any of the self-parody that finally made Roger Moore rather endearing. Brosnan delivers the double-entendres in the manner of a man whos trying to teach himself to swear; you just feel embarrassed by him. Imagine Sean Connery delivering the line Brosnan hands Richards as they sit on a balcony in Istanbul -- ""Ive alwaysh drreamed of having Chrishmash in Trrkey"" -- and youll be laughing for days. Brosnan was so good in ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" because the role allowed for his finicky quality. As Bond he continues to be a good-looking stand-in rather than a star. You wouldnt want to see a top-flight director with a distinctive personal style at the helm of a Bond movie. You want someone whose work is clean and efficient adept at keeping the thing moving along and balancing the ratio of silly to serious. Apart from the ongoing documentary series (whose latest entry is ""42 Up"") and the first half of ""Coal Miners Daughter"" Michael Apted has never had a style that is either distinctive or personal. I was grateful in the early scenes that unlike Roger Spottiswoode in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" Apted shot and cut the action sequences so you could follow what was going on. But it doesnt take long for his dull somewhat somnambulant anonymity to take over.The movie feels about a half-hour longer than its 128-minute running time and though the story is fairly simple its complicatedly told. By the time Apted launches into the big final set piece it feels as if youve been in your seat for hours and yet it all happens before youve had a chance to care. Hes also not especially gifted at violence. Maybe in deference to the wrongheaded attempt to make the series more ""realistic"" the fight scenes have a lot of grunting and thudding rather than the swift painlessness that should characterize a Bond fight.How hard can it be to make a good Bond movie? The best are little disreputable miracles the lucky combination of craft and keying into the pop moment. There must be brisk efficient directors out there who are capable of finding the right pace and tone. And there must be screenwriters who can come up with the right mix of smut and sophistication. There are plenty of worse disappointments this year than ""The World Is Not Enough"" but those disappointments dont have nearly four decades of audience affection built into them. Maybe its time to start saying ""God Save James Bond."" The new Bond films bear the same relation to the originals as those MCI ads do to the original Looney Tunes.

PARKS Copyright 1999 Houston Chronicle Published 630 am Friday November 19 1999 In The World Is Not Enough British secret agent 007 James Bond is sent to Azerbaijan to guard a troubled heiress only to find his help is not wanted. Elektra King daughter of an English oil magnate has a strange history. A year earlier she was kidnapped by the international terrorist Renard and held for ransom. British intelligence under the guidance of its chief M did nothing to rescue her. Eventually Elektra managed to kill her guards and escape. Then her father who was building an essential oil pipeline across Asia was murdered at British intelligence headquarters by a bomb that was unwittingly delivered by 007. Little wonder she doesnt want Bonds protection. Bond whose real assignment is to catch Renard should he attack Elektra again perseveres only to find himself up to his over-extended neck in a dangerous romance an international plot he cant figure out and enemies and friends hes not sure of. Bond is not the only one confused. Unlike most 007 films with easy-to-grasp world domination plots and outsized villains The World Is Not Enough has so many complexities of story and character that theaters should hand out programs at the door. In other spy films that could be a good thing but Bond fans may find themselves saying ""huh?"" more than once. Never mind. In Bond 19 (or 21 if you count the non-series Never Say Never Again and Casino Royale) 007 again saves the world. Fans who prefer Bond to just shut up and shoot people will not be disappointed. In several colorful locations -- Bilbao Spain; the Scottish Highlands; Baku Azerbaijan; Istanbul the French Alps -- Bond survives outrageously overdone but expertly staged action-set pieces. He stumbles into a series of beautiful and willing woman intent on loving -- or killing -- him. He cracks some of the worst sexual or bloodthirsty puns since well the last Bond film. The more things change the more they stay the same for James Bond. In this third go round as 007 Pierce Brosnan has matured into the role nicely. Hes still gracefully athletic but theres now more of a cynical ragged-edge to the smooth charm. It gives Bond a bit more depth to match the style of this film. After the mindless nonstop action of Bond 18 Tomorrow Never Dies the producers called upon an established director known for drama to make 007 human again. Michael Apted (Nell) had the tough assignment of slipping character development into the the brief dialogue scenes between explosions. Apteds partial success highlights how bereft the series is of real people but at least its a beginning. There is more substance to Bonds scenes with his boss M again played by Judi Dench and with Elektra played splendidly by riveting French actress Sophie Marceau (Braveheart). The film also stars Robert Carlyle (The Full Monty Angelas Ashes) as Renard one of the more human-scaled Bond villains. Renard is a terrorist determined to destroy the supply of oil to the West although his reasons are more complicated than idealism or money. What makes Renard unique is the bullet shot into his head by the late agent 009. The bullet is still there and will soon kill Renard. Until then it has deadened his physical senses. Its a clever idea one the filmmakers explore but not to its full psychological potential. They do allow Renard a surprisingly sympathetic love scene in which he cannot feel the warmth of his lovers skin. The big action sequences include Bond on skis attacked by parachutists Bond in an underground tunnel outracing a fireball Bond being attacked by helicopters equipped with giant buzz saws Bond in a boat fight on the Thames River Bond in a sinking submarine Bond in ... But why go on? What all the scenes have in common is that they are magnificently staged and almost devoid of any real suspense. The film has a genuine twist in the middle that doubles the threat of villainy and gives the movie some additional character texture. Entering the film midway through is nuclear weapons expert Christmas Jones played -- obviously with the directors tongue in cheek -- by Denise Richards (Wild Things Starship Troopers.) Dressed in tight shorts a sports bra and heavy work boots Richards is humorously unbelievable everytime she opens her mouth. She seems a bland girl next door compared to the exotically fascinating and talented Marceau. Its hard to imagine Bond being interested in her. Robbie Coltrane is back as the likable bad guy he played in GoldenEye. Of course Desmond Llewelyn returns as grumpy gadget master Q this time with an assistant played by former Monty Python-er John Cleese. The title song by the group Garbage plays against one of the more eccentric opening sequences of digital nude women and guns in oil. David Arnold again supplies the suitable while not outstanding score. It will be interesting to see if this more complex and human Bond goes over as well as the last two blockbusters. If it does perhaps the Bond films will continue to dabble with drama and realism.

Is this some sick cosmic joke? True Flawless never approaches the rancid bluster of 8MM but its an equally dishonest piece of manipulative hackwork. For his first screenplay since St. Elmos Fire Schumacher rehashes the feel-good improbable-bonding scenario of why-cant-we-all-get-along movies like As Good As It Gets in which a comically antagonistic relationship turns lovey-dovey in the name of tolerance and self-improvement. Robert De Niro plays Walt a retired security guard who lives in an Avenue A flophouse. Hes a guys guy--plays handball with the neighborhood kids treats women badly yells at drag queens. After a stroke leaves him partially paralyzed Walts advised to take singing lessons as therapy and--in one of many strikingly implausible plot points--decides to take them from Rusty (Philip Seymour Hoffman) the piano-playing drag queen upstairs whom he despises. De Niro applies his brand of show-offy restraint to stroke-victim cadences. Hoffman brings occasional unexpected nuance to a character written as equal parts hand-on-hip sassiness (""Im more man than youll ever be and more woman than youll ever get"") and tortured self-pity (""Im lonely Im ugly""). Schumachers direction is less shrill than usual; the fatal flaws lie in his screenplay which is bogged down with smug unfunny one-liners and a dreary subplot about drug dealers and their missing loot. Schumacher--most offensive when feigning seriousness (see A Time to Kill)--takes pains to emphasize how alone and ironically alike the protagonists are and the implicit equation of transgenderism with impairment leaves you sickened. Every non-Batman movie Schumacher makes is an argument for reviving the franchise. Though twice the macho man of De Niros Walt 2 by 4s Johnnie dabbles in drag with as much flair as the flaming Rusty. After a hard days work at the construction site Johnnie kicks back by donning mascara and feather boa and heading down to the local pub for karaoke night (his ""20th Century Boy"" strut-and-pout would do Jonathan Rhys-Meyers proud. From the outset a meltdown is in the cards--a Bronx-residing Irish emigre with a patient girlfriend and a taste for boy hustlers Johnnie suffers recurring nightmares that hint loudly at past trauma. In the lead role director-cowriter Jimmy Smallhorne gives a forceful concentrated performance. The film also benefits from expressive photography by Declan Quinn (who coincidentally also shot Flawless and seems to have been a marginally calming influence on Schumacher).2 by 4s main strength is its raw weathered feel but the films glib framing psychology--with intimations of abuse and talk of absent fathers--is like sandpaper on its rough naturalism. That Bond guy still seems to elicit an enormous amount of goodwill--a readiness to gloss over the movies brazen irrelevance and reflexive chatter about the supposedly comforting familiarity of on-cue explosions antiquated politics and atrocious puns. The turgid hysteria of Bond 19 The World Is Not Enough makes the strongest case for retirement since late-period Roger Moore. The quaintly elaborate (yet strangely unexciting) precredit sequence catapults Pierce Brosnans 007 from Bilbao (he strolls past Frank Gehrys new Guggenheim Museum just because its there) to a high-speed boat chase along the Thames (not a good idea so soon after Face/Off) that sends him crashing onto the barely completed Millennium Dome in Greenwich. More blandly extravagant set pieces follow involving paragliders a helicopter with attached buzzsaw and a nuclear sub. Character-actor Brits abound Robert Carlyle as the villain (vaguely superhuman as the result of a nerve-severing bullet in the brain) Judi Dench as M (acting up a storm--for what?) and an amusing John Cleese as R presumed successor to gadget freak Q. Sophie Marceau as an imperiled oil heiress may seem smart and tough by Bond-babe standards but the film is more interested in portraying her as a disturbed bitch. Denise Richards is at least an entertaining running joke playing a pert and toothy nuclear physicist. (Shes also named Christmas and you can bet your life on the eventual appearance of a pun about Christmas coming.) Whats most disappointing about The World Is Not Enough is that the famously adaptable Michael Apted--the man behind the 7Up series--adapts all too easily. Far too reverent in its winking irreverence the film treats a ragged formula as if it were sacred.

"World Is Not Enough The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; world-is-not-enough-the ) World Is Not Enough The (United Kingdom/United States 1999) A movie review by James Berardinelli Ten years ago when the second and final Timothy Dalton Bond movie Licence to Kill tanked at the box office it looked like the venerable secret agent had finally run out of gas driven into the ground by the likes of The Terminator and Rambo. A six year hiatus followed and when Bond finally returned in 1995s Goldeneye Dalton had been replaced by Pierce Brosnan and the series was said to have been given a complete overhaul. Actually as Goldeneye and its sequel Tomorrow Never Dies illustrated the changes were more cosmetic than anything else. Bond still drinks his martinis shaken not stirred still utters his signature ""Bond James Bond"" and still sleeps with any gorgeous woman who crosses his path. The only differences are that he has traded in his Aston Martin for a BMW and ""M"" has experienced a sex change. With Brosnan in the lead role the Bond series has undergone an unprecedented revival. Both Goldeneye and Tomorrow Never Dies exceeded the magical 100 million mark (the latter doing so while in direct competition with Titanic) and the latest movie (the 19th overall) The World Is Not Enough stands poised to join them. When it comes to Bond films theres really only one question Does it entertain for the entire running length? For The World Is Not Enough as for the previous two endeavors with Brosnan the answer is ""yes."" Theres nothing special shocking or precedent-setting about the film but it functions on a level that 007 fans will appreciate - as eye and ear candy for those who prefer action to exposition and character development. There are plenty of bangs flashes and chase sequences (on foot on skis and in the water) plus the usual array of beautiful women with skimpy outfits and funny names science fiction-inspired gadgets (cars that drive themselves x-ray glasses a jacket that inflates into a survival bubble) and exotic locales (Azerbaijan Kazakhstan Istanbul). In many ways its difficult to judge a Bond film by the same standards applied to other movies. The series has lasted long enough to establish its own set of rules and as long as the latest movie plays by them it usually works. Plot credibility for example is not a key element. Bond stories shouldnt be taken with just a grain of salt - you need the whole shaker. Its somehow easier to suspend disbelief to an extraordinary level while watching 007 execute the expected series of superhuman tricks. The fact is when it comes to a Bond movie the last thing anyone wants is believability. Were there to see the formula applied in the most ostentatious fashion possible - the louder and more over-the-top the better. Thats why it doesnt matter that were supposed to accept Denise Richards as a nuclear scientist or that the ending of The World Is Not Enough makes absolutely no sense. In fact this is the most lame Bond climax since Roger Moore and Christopher Walken fought it out on the Golden Gate Bridge at the end of A View to a Kill but who cares? With its emphasis on personal revenge The World Is Not Enough hearkens back to Licence To Kill. Only this time its ""M"" (Judi Dench) whos making things personal. When a good friend of hers is killed while inside MI6 headquarters ""M"" is determined to have the murderer hunted down and brought to justice. She assigns her best agent Bond (Brosnan) to protect her dead friends daughter Elektra King (Sophie Marceau). Bond soon discovers that the man who killed Elektras father and is now trying to eliminate her is a mysterious terrorist named Renard (Robert Carlyle) who is called ""The Anarchist."" Electra has previous ties to Renard. When she was younger he kidnapped her but she escaped before her father could pay the 5000000 ransom. But his purpose here seems more sinister than vengeance for a foiled plot. When Bond tracks him down he finds Rendard about to steal a nuclear bomb from a group of scientists led by Dr. Christmas Jones (Denise Richards). And ""M"" arrives on the scene just in time to be captured. The World Is Not Enough contains the usual array of eye-popping action sequences. The first preceding the opening credits features a boat chase capped off by a hot air balloon ride that ends with a bang. Later theres a high-tension ski chase that has Bond attacked from both land and sky (it seems that nearly every Bond movie gives the hero a chance to play in the snow). Then theres a race through an oil pipeline (something that hasnt been done before) some action in a submarine (another Bond staple) and a nicely-executed piece where Bond is the target of two helicopters armed with multiple oversized buzzsaws. In terms of genuine suspense The World Is Not Enough is a cut below Tomorrow Never Dies - but only a tiny cut. Character development has never been one of the series strong suits but theres actually some evidence of it here. The relationship between villain and henchman is more complex than usual not to mention a little unexpected in its nature. When it comes to the bad guys its business as usual but with a twist. Meanwhile Brosnan does a few interesting things with Bond. This is a rare movie in which we are given a clear picture of the characters loneliness - his dead wife is never mentioned but her presence hovers over Bond almost from the beginning. 007 is also colder here than in any film since Licence To Kill. Brosnan actively works to bring the screen superhero closer to Ian Flemings conscienceless secret agent. Sophie Marceau (Braveheart) who is a solid actress does a credible job as Elektra Bond girl 1. Not only is she pleasant to look at but she gives as good a performance as one can reasonably expect in these constricted circumstances. Equally attractive although not as capable is Denise Richards whose portrayal of Dr. Jones follows the Tanya Roberts model. Robert Carlyle still best known in the United States for his part in The Full Monty plays a relatively generic villain. Renard has a bullet lodged in his brain that is slowly killing him but until he dies it makes him stronger every day. (Warning do not use Bond movies as a means to gain medical or scientific knowledge.) Old friend Valentin Dimitreveych Zukovsky (Robbie Coltrane) previously seen in Goldeneye is back. The MI6 alphabet soup includes ""M"" ""Q"" (Desmond Llewelyn in what may be his last appearance) and newcomer ""R"" (John Cleese playing the part like Basil Fawlty) who is ""Q""s protA(c)gA(c). The score by composer David Arnold is the best in over a decade. While the opening song ""The World Is Not Enough"" (sung by Garbage) is not destined for greatness its better than ""Tomorrow Never Dies."" Throughout the film Arnold frequently borrows cues from John Barrys past work making the music sound decidedly ""Barry-esque."" The ""James Bond Theme"" is used often and incorporated effectively climaxing in a full rousing rendition played over the end credits. For Goldeneye Eric Serra didnt want to use the Dr. No music because he thought it was dated - The World Is Not Enough proves how wrong he was. Following The World Is Not Enough Brosnan is committed to one more Bond film after which he will probably leave the franchise. Unlike back in the late 80s and early 90s the series future is not in doubt. Only a dud would have jeopardized Bond 20 and The World Is Not Enough is far from that. For those who have enjoyed the other Bond movies (especially the most recent two) or for anyone who appreciates fast-paced action films The World Is Not Enough should prove to be a winner. Director Michael Apted may be best known for documentary efforts (the Seven Up series) and dramas (Gorillas In the Mist Nell) but he proves to have a deft hand managing the taut pace and pyrotechnics of this kind of motion picture. When it comes to action and excitement actors directors and screenwriters may change but theres still only one James Bond.
