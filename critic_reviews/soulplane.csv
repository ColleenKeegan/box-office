Nashawn Wade (Kevin Hart) wins 100 compensation after a carrier loses his dog nearly giving it a colonic irrigation in the process. He then sets up Nashawns Worldwide Airlines. Its motto We fly we party we land.Flight 069 gets in trouble when Captain Mack (Snoop Dogg) passes out high on mushrooms leaving it to Nashawn and his cousin Muggsy (Method Man) to save the day. Jokes range from the hilarious - theres a caucasian (skinny) butt adaptor in the WC and the emergency exit demonstration is sung to Beyonces Survivor - to a downright uncomfortable divide-and-rule jibe at the Middle East. Packed with cigars gold and champagne this is a modern Airplane that might not bling your bell but itll sure amuse dem urban kids no end.

Unfortunately the world is full of people who will likely find this brand of trashy humor entertaining. They are likely the same folks who comfortably and euphemistically refer to black culture as ""urban."" Its clear from the beginning when main character Nashawn (Kevin Hart) gets stuck on an airplane toilet that dirty slapstick jokes will add up to the sum of the film though for a split second there is hope that the story of an airline run by African Americans and for African Americans will take the higher road. After Nashawn wins a miraculous settlement of 100 million from the airline for his suffering (they also killed his dog) and decides to start his own airline instead of investing in his cousin Muggsys (Method Man) day care/strip club idea he comes off as a sympathetic non-swearing non-sex-crazed character who might actually do good for his people without confirming racists prejudices. But lo Nashawn isnt strong enough to buck the system. And neither were the writers or the actors who built the story around a purple plane that is souped-up with fancy rims and waits outside of Terminal X (named after Malcolm). They all just want to get paid. Before the inaugural flight Captain Mack (Snoop Dogg) shows up without real pilot credentials and security agent Jamiqua (MoNique) eagerly frisks some of the passengers who pass through the metal detectors using her power to take one of the tall handsome men into the bathroom and inspect him more. Once inside the plane passengers drool over the swanky first-class area a banging night club and scantily clad sexy flight attendants. Those not lucky enough to stay there are relegated to the ""low class"" section in which antennas for television monitors are tweaked with aluminum foil overhead compartments are lockers that require change to open and people who dont get seats cling to subway-style bars hanging from the ceiling during the long flight from Los Angeles to New York. And since no black comedy would be complete without the unhip white guy and his kids who think they are down Mr. Hunkee (Tom Arnold) and his family are on the maiden voyage of Flight 69. Mr. Hunkees son dons Rocawear and translates ebonics for his dad who is the platform for too many jokes about black male genitalia. Its a shaky flight considering Captain Mack doesnt really know how to operate a plane and instead gets high in the cockpit. Along the way there are many sex-based scenes including a running subplot about a couple who copulates all over the plane and one in which a horny blind passenger has an ""American Pie"" moment with a potato. In the post-9/11 airline era there is also a fair amount of Arab-bashing as well as some African- and homosexual-bashing. The acting and the script are nowhere near good enough to make anybody believe these references are all in the spirit of good fun. An hour and a half of real airplane turbulence is better than sitting through the bad offensive material that makes up ""Soul Plane."" Fo shizzle.

The movie promises to be a sort of Ebonicized ""Airplane"" a fusillade of jokes and sight gags in the tradition of Americas finest bonehead comedies. <a href=""http//ad.doubleclick.net/jump/wpni.artsandlivingarticle/movies/reviews;dir=hornadaynode;dir=artsandliving;dir=movies;dir=reviews;dir=hornaday;page=article;kw=;ad=ss;ad=bb;ad=hp;pos=ad26;sz=300x250;tile=20;abr=ie;ord=1085773962021?""></a> <a href=""http//ad.doubleclick.net/jump/wpni.artsandlivingarticle/movies/reviews;dir=hornadaynode;dir=artsandliving;dir=movies;dir=reviews;dir=hornaday;page=article;kw=;ad=ss;ad=bb;ad=hp;pos=ad27;sz=160x600;tile=20;abr=ie;ord=1085773962021?""></a> <a href=""http//ad.doubleclick.net/jump/wpni.artsandlivingarticle/movies/reviews;dir=hornadaynode;dir=artsandliving;dir=movies;dir=reviews;dir=hornaday;page=article;kw=;ad=ss;ad=bb;ad=hp;pos=ad24;sz=336x850;tile=20;abr=ie;ord=1085773962022?""></a> Instead ""Soul Plane"" is only fitfully funny and it makes up for what it lacks in genuine humor by overdosing viewers with outrageous sexuality and outsize stereotypes. Anyone who enjoyed ""Undercover Brother"" a couple of years ago will agree that these arent necessarily bad things; they just need the ballast of satirical intelligence for maximum effect. Hart plays Nashawn Wade a Los Angeles native who grew up in the shadow of LAX airport -- or more accurately as a hilarious visual indicates in the shadow of the planes taking off every few minutes. When the grown-up Nashawn sues a major airline after a disastrous flight he wins 100 million and immediately fulfills his lifelong dream of buying his own airline. He christens it NWA builds his own terminal complete with a chicken-and-waffle house a 99-cent store and a basketball court and designs the most elaborate plane cruising the friendly skies (I believe that in the official FAA glossary the correct term for it would be ""pimped out""). Giant purple with chrome-plated wheels the NWA plane that makes its maiden voyage in ""Soul Plane"" has two classes first and low. In first class guests sip Cristal and nibble at filet mignon while cosseted in plush leather seats. In low class the unwashed drink Colt 45 and pass a box of Popeyes chicken; the video monitors are old TV sets the overhead storage bins are coin-operated lockers and some passengers even stand holding on to subway-car poles. The admittedly ingenious set design of ""Soul Plane"" hits its zenith in the cockpit where the sleepily cool Captain Mack (Snoop Dogg) flies while smoking cigarettes of questionable provenance and leaning back and listening to rap CDs; his navigator plays an Xbox. It turns out that not only does Captain Mack not know how to fly a plane but his enthusiasm for controlled substances renders him unable to land it once the flight arrives in New York. There are some genuinely funny moments in ""Soul Plane"" many of them thanks to Snoop Dogg who between this and ""Starsky amp; Hutch"" is proving to be a surprisingly reliable supporting comic player and comedian MoNique who plays a trash-talking sexually harassing female security guard. And there are some fleetingly amusing gags involving Caucasians here represented by Tom Arnold as the head of the whitest family in America (theyre just returning from a visit to Cracker Land). But for the most part ""Soul Plane"" earns its laughs the lazy way by upping the ante in raunchy physical and sexual humor. The movies centerpiece scene featuring a blind man (John Witherspoon) and a baked potato clearly strives to be this years version of the signature sequence in ""American Pie."" When its not snickering at nymphomaniacal sex and the physical endowments of black men ""Soul Plane"" engages in broad ethnic humor at the expense of a hotblooded Latina flight attendant and the flights lone Arab passenger. The group that comes in for the most ribbing is homosexuals who serve as the films tedious all-purpose brunt. Although Hart is an appealing presence on-screen his nominal co-star Method Man isnt nearly as charismatic or likable as Nashawns cousin and D.L. Hughley -- who is not to be missed when he appears on Bill Mahers HBO talk show -- is completely wasted as a bathroom attendant. Still ""Soul Plane"" is guaranteed to find an eager audience in viewers who far from being easily offended are always on the lookout for ways to mortify their sensibilities. Having been duly informed of whats in store they are now free to move about the cabin; just keep the Popeyes and Colt 45 coming. Soul Plane (86 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for strong sexual content language and some drug use.

Photo by Bruce Talamon. Attention passengers boarding Soul Plane You will encounter funny raunchy turbulence 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Soul Plane Comedy. Starring Kevin Hart Snoop Dogg Tom Arnold Method Man. Directedby Jessy Terrero. (Rated R. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Snoop Dogg perhaps the only person on earth qualified to pilot a plane called NWA Flight 069 takes enough of a break from his skirt chasing and drug taking to notice that his aircraft has climbed to 30000 feet. ""(Expletive) man"" he drawls. ""Were higher than Redman at the Source Awards."" If the above joke makes no sense to you then make every effort to skip ""Soul Plane."" Skip this movie if you are offended by sex in public places animals dying in the name of a cheap joke rappers or Tom Arnold. Do you work in the airline industry or have respect for those who do? Do you believe the police when they say Tupac is dead? Do you fear God and wonder if he may be judging us in part based on the movies we choose to see? Skip it. Skip it. Skip it. Pretty much everyone else will find enjoyment in ""Soul Plane"" a better- than-average comedy that is raunchy and tasteless but ultimately funny from beginning to end. The setup is the best part of the film mostly because it features the two most humorous characters -- Kevin Hart and an overachieving Arnold. Nashawn Wade (Hart) grew up loving planes -- his house was on the end of a runway -- but he ends up on an all-white flight from hell where hes poisoned by his meal has to watch as his dog is sucked into a jet engine and gets stuck in a toilet. It wont be this movies last trip to the bathroom. Wade uses a 100 million verdict against the airline to buy his own jet which has spinning rims four-wheel motion and flight attendants who look like very expensive hookers. Meanwhile Elvis Hunkee (Arnold) gets bumped from his flight and becomes the only white man on the Soul Planes maiden voyage. Screenwriters Chuck Wilson and Bo Zenga give the large cast of character actors plenty to work with. Passengers either sit in first class or low class which looks eerily like Munis 14-Mission line. Snoop Doggs Captain Mack got his pilots license at Pelican Bay Penitentiary -- it was either that or a GED -- while Hunkees attractive daughter has just turned 18 and Flight 069 has a dance club ... Some of the bits are too cliched to be funny (theres an overacting blind character and a gay male flight attendant named Flame) but the majority work (MoNique is hilarious as an airport security officer). And this revizzle wouldnt be complete without noting that Snoop is totally off the hizzle. (Once again skip this movie if you dont know what that means.) ""Soul Plane"" gets progressively less entertaining as it continues -- making it that much more noticeable that theres virtually no character development and even less plot. Then again how much plot was there at the last good party you attended? -- Advisory This film contains a lot of adult language and sexual situations.

"Sad Soul Plane strays way off course - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Sad Soul Plane strays way off course By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  May 28 2004 ""Soul Plane"" wants to know why the friendly skies cant be a little blacker. The answer is that theres a possibility theyd wind up like this scattershot comedy which I guess is a black ""Airplane"" When its funny its uproarious. Otherwise youre crestfallen to discover that the movie is a relentless sucker punch to black entrepreneurship.Written by Chuck Wilson and Bo Zenga and directed by Jessy Terrero the movie is predicated on unkempt uncouth misbehavior centered around the airlines maiden flight from Los Angeles to New York City. The plane is a big purple pimped-out air bus that looks like Barney with chrome mags.The company is the result of a 100 million settlement won by Nashawn (Kevin Hart) after he sues a major airline for killing his dog. The movie sets up a few good gags The plane leaves from Terminal X (as in Malcolm) which is a vast mall that includes a basketball court and a massive dollar store. And the airlines name NWA must be some iteration of the unprintable name of Ice Cube and Dr. Dres old rap group person ""with an airline.""A lot of the story revolves around a white family of four headed by an uptight Tom Arnold and Missi Pyle (whose face has amazing reactions) thats bumped onto the NWA flight. Predictably enough theyre named the Hunkees although nobody pronounces it that way. By the end of the movie each one is liberated chiefly through sex which abounds in ""Soul Plane."" You cant go two steps without it hitting you upside the head.The movie has a thorough notion of what a flying black might be like putting two of the self-proclaimed ""queens of comedy"" MoNique and Sommore on security detail. They have one decent scene at a metal detector thats like an excerpt from the BET stand-up show ""Comic View.""The flight crew is led by Snoop Dogg. The idea of him as the pilot is funny but its execution is a different story. His Captain Mack is an ex-con who has never flown before is typically stoned (as Snoop Dogg must be) and happens to be afraid of heights. It wouldve been cleverer if hed played it straight leaving the chronic toking to someone else.The planes first-class cabin resembles the inside of Air Force One reupholstered to look like the champagne room of a strip club where Lou Rawls is playing. Upstairs theres a nightclub as big as a football stadium. ""Low class"" looks like a subway car complete with Colt 45 ads and a standing-only section. While the premier passengers get filet mignon the folks in coach have to pass around a box of fried chicken.Then theres the instructional safety video which is set to a customized version of Destiny Childs ""Survivor"" and performed by the flight attendants including Flame the obligatory lascivious gay guy. Despite him its one of the funniest things Ive seen all year. More often however the movie traffics in embarrassing bathroom jokes and witless raunch a lot of it courtesy of the tirelessly vulgar John Witherspoon as a randy blind gentleman.NWA is where black people fly presumably because it meets needs ""white airlines"" dont. Whos so sick of Delta and United that theyd be crazy enough to buy a ticket to ride on an unproven airline named after a defunct rap group?In contrast to the entrepreneurial spirit of ""Barbershop"" the joke of NWA is that when black people do for themselves they do shoddily. Why is that funny? ""Soul Plane"" is sometimes outrageous (every single scene in low class is hilarious) but frequently saddening The people in first class are as ghetto as the ones in coach.""Soul Plane"" presents a commercially viable idea of a black culture beset with low self-esteem and lower expectations. Theres an old observation among some African-Americans that Chris Rock popularized There are black people and there are these other black people who are unreliable and out of control. Its these other black people you dont want flying your airplanes -- or making your movies.

The initial energy and hard-working cast yield a few belly laughs that should generate goodwill and a decent showing at the box office gates. Positioned as a next-generation ""Airplane"" with an African-American flavor ""Soul Plane"" begins as a high-spirited romp before running out of gas and ideas about halfway up the tarmac. The initial energy and hard-working cast yield a few belly laughs that should generate goodwill and a decent showing at the box office gates but the haul will be considerably lower than it might have been had the script and story been properly serviced. Exploiting every black stereotype imaginable and sparing little in the way of sexual and scatological references pic nevertheless possesses an over-the-top exuberance thats good fun for awhile. Yet whats clearly meant to tap into the same audience that made ""Barbershop"" a hit figures to come up short with both white and black audiences lacking enough character development to ground the wackiness while exhausting the joke supply about halfway through a relatively brief voyage. After a humiliating experience aboard a big commercial carrier aimless twentysomething Nashawn Wade (Kevin Hart) receives a 100 million judgment he decides to put to use launching his own airline -- christened of course NWA. Granted its more South Central than Southwest with a bright purple exterior oversized wheels a super-ritzy first class and downscale ""low class"" where even the upholstery on the seats dont match. A randy security worker (MoNique) feels up handsome male passengers and far from the usual safety video the sexed-up stewardesses sing the Destinys Child ditty ""Survivor."" Flanked by his cousin Muggsy (Method Man) Nashawns inaugural flight -- under a doobie-smoking just-paroled pilot played by Snoop Dogg -- is complicated when an old flame winds up on board wearing an engagement ring. So far so good but not long after takeoff it becomes clear the creative tank is running low. The few relationships that could provide any kind of a story arc never lift off -- from Nashawns former g.f. (K.D. Aubert) to Tom Arnold who has apparently never met a part he didnt like. On vacation with his trophy girlfriend and kids he winds up on the flight essentially to provide a whiteys-eye-view of the proceedings. Tyro feature director Jessy Terrero sticks to his musicvideo roots and keeps the volume high -- milking what he can from Bo Zenga and Chuck Wilsons script which certainly doesnt shy away from potentially offensive material. Arnold refers to a black guy as ""Kobe"" when he gets too near his teenage daughter (Arielle Kebbel); security sandwiches an Arab passenger; and sundry jokes play out in the oversized bathroom where D.L. Hughley is stationed as an attendant. For the most part the general tone of irreverence lets such excesses draw a pass though a chronically horny couple obsessed with membership in the ""mile-high club"" wouldnt be missed had someone thought to hit the ""erase"" button. Despite the pics limitations standup Hart exhibits promise here -- as he has in ABCs defunct sitcom ""The Big House"" exuding a likable quality even in such zany surroundings; still he cant flesh out his character amid the sprawling cast thats in on the action. The upbeat score (including a title song by Snoop Dogg) is the only tech credit of note with ""Soul Plane"" obviously operating on a discount budget before making a rather abrupt landing. When the film makes a sly reference to being the equivalent of ""JetBlack"" the impression is it isnt kidding. Soul PlaneProductionAn MGM release of a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures presentation.

This is your captain Snoop Dogg speaking Were expecting some turbulizzle on the way to our destinizzle... MGM Pictures Soul Plane 1/2 Soul Plane is such a sorry raunchfest that when a main character announces in a key scene ""Im not running out like I always do"" one is tempted to shout ""But I am"" and then bolt from the theater. (Related video See a clip from Soul Plane) Amid this melange of sleazy sex jokes ultra-graphic bathroom humor and ethnic stereotypes there are a couple of guilty-pleasure laughs but essentially Soul Plane is 90 minutes of amateurish adolescent yuks. Kevin Hart plays a likable guy who has a traumatic experience on a plane the only printable part being the loss of his dog. For this and some humiliation involving a toilet he wins a 100 million settlement. He starts up NWA Airlines named after the rap group. Aboard a souped-up metallic purple jet the crew is lasciviously sassy. Theres a long offensive segment involving a security official (Monique) who goes beyond throwing her weight around and molests a handsome passenger. Snoop Dogg plays the pilot whos afraid of heights but not of flying high. First-class passengers sit on couches have the use of huge bathrooms monitored by a probing attendant (D.L. Hughley) eat lobster sip Cristal and party hearty in a disco. Regular folks get a bucket of fried chicken. With its excessive sleaze and gross-out gags Soul Plane overshoots effective spoofery. Mostly its a foul eye-rolling experience. (R strong sexual content language and some drug use) --Claudia Puig Baadasssss   As a slightly bigger-than-life embrace of how a cinematic milestone came to be Baadasssss is a family affair a ready-made crossword-puzzle answer and yes an entertaining movie. Director/star/co-writer Mario Van Peebles plays his father Melvin who filmed starred in significantly bankrolled and then promoted 1971s Sweet Sweetbacks Baadasssss Song seminal for both the fledgling black and independent cinema movements. Thirty-plus years ago Song got away with showing a Watts male hustler killing crooked cops and getting away with it an act that set the table for one of the all-time best ad tag-lines ""Rated X by an All-White Jury."" This movie is more wistful and winking though its obvious Mario is still working out emotional baggage with his tyrannically driven old man. Peppered with interviews of actors playing real people then wrapping up by letting us see the real people themselves its a blisteringly paced look at filmmaking on the fringes with stealth non-union crews; a lead actress who suddenly balks at nudity; and a financial angel named Bill Cosby. The movie deals in very broad strokes when it implies that black actors (five years after the TV premiere of Cosbys I Spy) were stuck in emasculated roles by the time Song was made. But Baadasssss makes it easy to go with the melody. (In select cities.

""Airplane"" taught us that much 24 years ago when Barbara Billingsley helpfully translated a black passengers ""jive"" into English. Now THERE was a race joke - so transgressively silly it ascended into the comic absurd-o-sphere. The makers of Soul Plane figured theyd simply reverse the racial polarity and pack a whole movie full of similar material - just not as funny. Basic brazen and scatologically obsessed ""Plane"" forgoes any analysis of its essentialist japery marveling instead at its own familiar naughtiness. The best gags - and the cheapest - involve the aircraft itself a pimped-out microcosm of black stereotypes from its Escalade-sleek First Class cabin to ""Low Class"" a flying tenement lined with liquor ads. If youre looking for comic insights beyond the well-documented ass differential between whites and blacks well golly you ought to try another carrier.
