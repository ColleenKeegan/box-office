But only when hes approached by Al Melvin (Jeffrey Wright) does he realise hes not alone in his psychic turmoil and begin to suspect that theres more than meets the eye to the much-vaunted heroic acts allegedly performed by Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber) when they were ambushed in the desert much vaunted because Shaw with not a little encouragement and help from his fiercely ambitious mother Senator Ellie Shaw (Meryl Streep) is running as vice-presidential candidate in the upcoming elections. Marcos dreams dont disappear but Melvin does - at least until hes found drowned in the Potomac. Time for Marco to talk turkey with Shaw... Given the classic status of John Frankenheimers 1962 movie Jonathan Demme his cast and writers Daniel Pyne and Dean Georgaris were risking ridicule in taking on another version of Richard Condons novel. Happily this extremely timely entertainment matches even perhaps surpasses its predecessor. Suspense and sly humour are again in abundance as is political relevance. Here is an America where truth democracy and proper ethical considerations are imperilled not by Cold War enemies but by unbridled late capitalism itself; dynastic ambition hollow patriotism meaningless slogans the fuelling of fear and paranoia media complicity and puppet figureheads under the influence of shady self-serving global conglomerates are the order of the day. Nothing surprising about that really except that this is a Hollywood genre movie and its terrific for once to see a sharp slick adult darkly comic thriller whose more outlandish aspects - brainwashing by implant say - succeed so well as metaphors for contemporary reality. The performances (especially that of Streep) are spot-on the script extraordinarily up-to-date and Demmes direction - particularly the creation of unease through the subtle use of sound and odd direct-to-camera dialogue - a real return to form after his last film. Worryingly superior stuff.

"The improbable integrity of the new Manchurian Candidate. Slate Sign In Sign Up The improbable integrity of the new Manchurian Candidate. The improbable integrity of the new Manchurian Candidate. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 29 2004 638 PM Brainwash Rinse Repeat The improbable integrity of the new Manchurian Candidate. By David Edelstein Now its corporations not Communists who bully When I heard that Jonathan Demme planned to remake John Frankenheimers sensational 1962 thriller The Manchurian Candidate I passed in about a minute through four stages of Kubler-Rossian grief denial (""He cant be that stupid"") anger (""Is nothing sacred?"") bargaining (""I just wont see the damn thing"") and depression (""Is he that desperate?""). The final stage acceptance came only after seeing Demmes movie and coming to terms with his achievement. The new The Manchurian Candidate (Paramount) doesnt have anything approaching the audacious cynicism of Frankenheimers (and screenwriter George Axelrods) original and the climax doesnt make you similarly sick with suspense. But this is a work of passionate conviction. It has some of Fahrenheit 9/11s fire in the belly and an aura of tragedy to go with it. Beautifully made and unsurpassingly creepy its the rare remake with something contemporary to add. Of course it would have to have something new to add wouldnt it? The Frankenheimer-Axelrod adaptation of Richard Condons bracingly unsentimental novel is indelibly early 60s when fear of the Red Menace collided head-on with revulsion for the Red-baiting legacy of Sen. Joseph McCarthy; when the themes of brainwashing and the bomb and 50s ultrasensitive mommas boys and Freudian monster-mamas all coalesced into the freakiest paranoid melodrama the country had ever seen. And it was released during the Cuban missile crisis when peoples heads were already messed up. Advertisement The terrible new threat in Demmes remake isnt Reds or terrorists but a multinational conglomerate--which functions as the recent documentary The Corporation contends with the same level of conscience as a DSM-IV textbook psychopath. The ""Manchurian"" of the title is now ""Manchurian Global"" a corporation obviously modeled on Halliburton down to the no-bid contracts and overcharges in Iraq. And the title character is different too. In the original hes the buffoonish McCarthy-like vice-presidential nominee John Iselin whos poised to win the presidency once his brainwashed stepson assassinates his running mate. Here that stepson the mommas boy and alleged war hero Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber) is himself the Manchurian Candidate--a senator whos a candidate for his partys vice-presidential nomination. Thats good and bad. Good because it upends much of what we recall from the original so that at every turn Demme and his screenwriters Daniel Pyne and Dean Georgaris are using our expectations to pull the rug out from under us. Its bad because Demme and Schreiber havent rethought the character all the way through. This Raymond is if anything an even more charmless abrasive rich boy than Condons; and if there are moments when Schreibers nerdy solipsism is desperately poignant there are others when he doesnt bother to make Raymond a plausible politician--thereby blowing the chance for some good nasty satire in this convention season. Critics like David Denby have labeled Schreiber a major actor and Schreiber is so intent on proving it to the world that he gives us Method actorish cerebral contortions in the middle of big political speeches. The other parts happily are played to the hilt--and in the case of Meryl Streep as Raymonds mother Eleanor Prentiss Shaw a God-and-country conservative senator the hilt above the hilt. Streep substitutes a high-wire borderline-camp theatricality for Angela Lansburys simmering inner demonism packing more extravagant business into every second than anyone since--well Streep in her theater days before something (stage fright? bawling kids?) drove her full-time to the screen. (God what a loss.) The way she disgustedly spits out the description of the liberal Sen. Jordan played by Jon Voight as a one-wwwworlder had me screaming and she stops the movie just by crunching down on some ice cubes with a mixture of cruelty and insouciance. The work of Denzel Washington as Army Maj. Ben Marco is in an entirely different key. The actor who won an Oscar for his charismatic grandstanding in Training Day (2002) is here a messed-up mumbling sweat-drenched shell of a man his eyes pulling back in anguish from the words coming out of his mouth--words that he knows he has been programmed to say. Ive never seen this cock-of-the-walk actor play a character who doesnt seize the space. The role must have taken something out of him and the performance is a personal triumph. Its also a testament to Demmes humanism which makes actors like Washington feel safe to go into themselves. There are no bit parts in a Demme movie no expendable characters no cannon fodder. The Manchurian Candidate is full of Demme stock-company players--Kimberly Elise (doing a big variation on the Janet Leigh role) Ted Levine Dean Stockwell Charles Napier Paul Lazar even Robyn Hitchcock as an English guide in Kuwait. And everyone registers. As Sen. Jordan Jon Voight weighs his words like a man whose life has been spent trying to reconcile his intellect and his awareness of political realities. For an actor who has on occasion seemed more than a little bonkers its an amazingly grounded performance--perfectly judged. Even Simon McBurneys Atticus Noyle--the mad neuroscientist who pops up in dreams and behind the false walls in the back of closets--is a fascinatingly complex little slug a soothing sadist. Maybe Demme isnt enough of a sadist to make a thriller that drills into your skull with the same ruthless efficiency as Noyle (or for that matter Frankenheimer). And the movie does slacken and go a little soft in the climax. But the dread that permeates it almost compensates. The scenes of the soldiers in Raymonds old squadron (among them Jeffrey Wright) who know that something terrible is in their heads (but not what) linger and give the whole film the feel of a post-traumatic-stress-disorder nightmare a bad dream of losing ones mind and body while the powerful look on with monstrous indifference. No this isnt the twisted sexy tragicomic stick of dynamite that Frankenheimer gave us in 1962. Its more like a toxin that eats at you slowly from within. In more ways than one its the Gulf War Syndrome goes to the movies. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air.

It almost doesnt matter how hokey things get its too watchable to worry. Theres something about the high-class paranoid thriller whose heyday was in the 1970s with such classics as ""Three Days of the Condor"" and ""The Parallax View"" that is deeply satisfying. In a way ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" with its direct implications of an ominous idiocy in Americas back-slapping boardrooms semiconsciously follows the same genre. Not that the story components in ""Manchurian"" arent carefully worked out -- or over. Demme and screenwriters Daniel Pyne and Dean Georgaris clearly pored over John Frankenheimers original 1962 movie which starred Frank Sinatra Laurence Harvey and an unforgettable Angela Lansbury and updated and retrofitted everything. What was a thriller set in the deepest darkest paranoid waters of the Cold War has become a sort of post-Gulf War Halliburton-dunit a movie about corporate evil mind control and political maneuvering. Its an intriguing transmogrification which ultimately becomes too torturously labored to believe. But it sure draws you in for a while. For more than a dozen years Maj. Bennett Marco (Denzel Washington) has been giving public motivational speeches that pay tribute to the actions of a certain Sgt. Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber) during the Gulf War. Bennett (then a captain) and Shaw survived a nighttime firefight in the Kuwaiti desert. Shaw received the Medal of Honor for saving his men while Marco has become the storyteller. Funny thing is he doesnt really remember what happened. He just tells the tale. And he tries to ignore his dreams which paint a lurid picture of brainwashings and bizarre executions of American soldiers. When the emotionally ravaged Al Melvin (Jeffrey Wright) a former member of Bennetts platoon corners Bennett an inconvenient truth starts to surface. Als been suffering the same nightmarish images about that ill-fated night. And theres something fishy too about the similar phrases Bennett Al and other survivors have used to retell the story. Bennett is disturbed enough to seek out Raymond who at this point is a congressman touted as a vice presidential contender for the out-of-power partys White House candidate. (Raymonds party is never specifically identified but its clearly Democrat). Raymond is a mamas boy with a vengeance the son of the icy hawkish Sen. Eleanor Prentiss Shaw (Meryl Streep). Her agenda is clear She wants her military hero of a son in the White House and she has enough influence in the party (the same as her sons) to make it happen. Bennett finds Raymond alternately welcoming and dismissive. He seems to be a soul in moral torment who resents his mother and yet does her bidding. Whats going on? When the sinister plan at the heart of this drama becomes clear you have to wonder Wasnt there a simpler way for the bad guys to achieve their objective? Surely no one would work this hard not to mention indirectly and patiently to be evil. And when the movies subtle menace becomes a series of helter-skelter chasings and killings you can either part with the movie or hop onto this runaway train. Either way youre likely to enjoy Washington Schreiber and Streep who stoke this ride with dead-on performances. (Theres a nice turn too from Kimberly Elise as Bennetts helpmate.) Washingtons a charismatic traditional thriller hero a man (lets roll out the tagline cliches) who gets pushed to his limit but wholl stop at nothing to get to the bottom of this. He gets the movies prime punch line too when a potential political ally (Jon Voight) suggests Bennett is making claims that are rumors and conjectures. ""I started with nightmares"" Bennett tells the senator. ""Rumors and conjectures are a giant leap forward."" Schreiber whose body temperature seems to be sub-zero in this role makes a formidable force to reckon with. And speaking of freezing point Streep (who reprises the role made legendary by Lansbury) is a disconcerting caricature combination of Vice President Cheney and Hillary Clinton hellbent on getting her son into the Oval Office. You havent seen camp until you watch her crunch the ice in her glass. Those could be human bones in that petite maw. With characters like these squaring off and a climactic finale set on the main stage of a political convention you cant help thinking Bring it on.

The movie directed by a Jonathan Demme who should know better is a mediocre reengineering of the John Frankenheimer classic of 1962. It shunts through the material doing some interesting synthesizing some genetic recombining but it all adds up to something less powerful and interesting than the original. That by the way is exactly what was said of Demmes last film ""The Truth About Charlie"" a dreary remake of an equally great early 60s film ""Charade."" A filmmaker who could cast Mark Wahlberg in the Cary Grant part is possibly a little bereft of judgment from the get-go. The original ""Manchurian"" concocted by a paranoia addict and brilliant thriller writer named Richard Condon started with the harm Sen. Joe McCarthy was doing to America in the 50s. Condon thought it couldnt be worse if McCarthy were a Soviet agent. So he decided to spin a tale from that premise adding certain delicious twists the McCarthy surrogate (named John Yerkes Iselin) was an alcoholic boob; the malicious Red agent running him was his ambitious wife who happened also to be the mother by first marriage of one weird fellow named Raymond Shaw. When Mother Shaw demanded from her masters a perfect assassin to help advance the master plan they kidnapped her son (on duty in the Korean War) brainwashed him (and his platoon) and sent him back to her. The idea was to get Sen. Iselin into the White House under Red control by any means possible including the murder of those who stand in his way. Meanwhile the fellow trying to decipher all this was Ben Marco Raymonds commanding officer in Korea also brainwashed but suffering recurrent nightmares as the brainwashing breaks down. What made the movie work was style Frankenheimer was fresh out of live TV in New York and he got a TV directors immediacy and incisiveness into the film with vivid close-ups a lot of shock cutting some new visualizations of conventional action sequences. The film language (and Condons in the book so ironic so witty so nearly comical) really reformed the ways in which this kind of story was told. That stylistic excitement is gone of course. The new movie feels like any of a hundred almost-good recent thrillers. Demme and screenwriters Daniel Pyne and Dean Georgaris pretty much hew to the original premise though you can guess the updates. The Korean War has become the Gulf War. Reds no longer being around the filmmakers assign all evil to an investment outfit called the Manchurian Fund a kind of Michael Moore fantasy of Fascism Inc. The women -- Raymonds mom but also Bens love interest -- no longer achieve their power through the men Instead of being married to a senator Raymonds mother is a senator. Instead of telling his troubles to his new girlfriend who knows an FBI agent Ben Marco tells them to a new girlfriend who is an FBI agent and so forth. Also Raymond is not a journalist as (in the original) he became upon his return from Korea; he is a congressman and it is he not Sen. Iselin the McCarthy surrogate (now gone from the picture) who is the Manchurian candidate being maneuvered to the top job. Some of this is extremely clever but many of the changes also hurt. By cutting Iselin they cut the engine of the story which is Condons fury at McCarthy. They thus rob the film of the originals strongest element which was the great James Gregorys take on Iselin-McCarthy as a drunken fool charging that there were 29 er no 49 no no no 57 commies in the Defense Department. That has been replaced by nothing; no outrage drives the movie. And none of the devices -- from the phrase that got Raymond into his killer robot mood to the killings themselves -- is as elegant and expressive here as they were there. Worst of all the really cool karate fight -- one of the first American martial arts sequences -- between Frank Sinatras Marco and Henry Silvas Chunjin has been done away with entirely. The big news surrounding this film of course is the allegation that Meryl Streep in the role of Raymonds mother (Angela Lansbury was brilliantly cold in the original) evokes Hillary Rodham Clinton. The problem with this is that its wrong. Streep whos brilliant does a far more generic Washington power-woman spin. Shes the best thing in the picture alternately as coy as a concubine and as shrewd as a Chicago ward heeler but with a mind faster than an adding machine a will of iron and charisma that wont stop. Shes much more Pamela Harriman than Hillary and she doesnt have that nasal Chicago squawk-accent that bedevils Hillary (I can call it that because I have one too only worse). Denzel Washington plays the Army intelligence officer Ben Marco whose nightmares caused by the unraveling of his dry-cleaned brain first suggest theres something dangerous beneath Raymonds focused professional politicians personality. Washingtons got big shoes to fill as Sinatras was probably the best performance of his career. He fills them well enough but not remarkably. As for Raymond hes now played by Liev Schrieber an extremely interesting young actor. Of the principals hes the one who appears to have studied the antecedent performance the most closely. Thus hes not really playing Raymond Shaw hes playing Laurence Harvey playing Raymond Shaw and the results are mesmerizing. But the film goes wrong I think in investing too much science fiction hubba-hubba in the brainwashing technologies. Frankenheimer pretty much took them for granted; Demme feels an urge to painstakingly document them with a long backstory that affiliates a rogue Boer scientist (Boers Multinationals The movie isnt taking any chances is it?) with the Manchurian Fund this creepy guy being some kind of genius at plugging wires into brains a la ""Frankenstein"" and then planting behavior-modifying microchips in zzzzz-zzzzzz. Oh sorry fell asleep there during the sci-fi junk. And a plot that turns on presidential assassination released into an environment positively wacko with president hatred? Is that really a good idea? Do we want to see a sniper in a hidden room the view through his scope as the crosshairs caress the target? Possibly some folks should have rethought this one as they rethought so many others. But in the end what I missed more than anything was the great John Frankenheimer. He was a fabulous director always interesting always finding some new way of doing things. This film is professional but meek. This ""Manchurian Candidate"" feels as if it were directed by someone with a South African microchip in his brain. The Manchurian Candidate (130 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for battle violence close-range murders and assorted hissy fits.

Browse over 8 million products  Clothing amp; Jewelry  Computers amp; Electronics  Home amp; Garden  Kids amp; Family A machinated Candidate By Mike Clark USA TODAY Despite its brand-name title A-list cast/director combo and convention-week timing The Manchurian Candidate is a case of smart and talented people trying to jam a Cold War square into a Gulf War circle. You can feel the chafing to say nothing of the burden this capably crafted shrug has taken on. Denzel Washington and Liev Schreiber stand in for Frank Sinatra and Laurence Harvey in the remake of The Manchurian Candidate. Paramount Pictures Thats because director John Frankenheimers 1962 adaptation of Richard Condons novel is now regarded as a classic. I saw it upon release at 15 and had never seen anything weirder -- a unique mix of conspiracy theories political satire martial arts mayhem a depressed Frank Sinatra Korean War brainwashing and assassination 13 months before JFK in Dallas. But over the decades conspiracy thrillers have become nearly as common as comedies about teen hormones and even Denzel Washington Meryl Streep and director Jonathan Demme cant make a Kuwait-for-Korea switch resonate. Liev Schreiber (standing in for the originals more interestingly neurotic Laurence Harvey) is being ""programmed"" to be president. Isnt everybody these days? ABOUT THE MOVIE The Manchurian Candidate   1/2 (out of four) Stars Denzel Washington Meryl Streep Liev Schreiber Jon Voight Kimberly Elise Jeffrey Wright Director Jonathan Demme Distributor Paramount Rating R for violence and language Opens Friday nationwide The movies updates of the Cold War milieu (the most entertaining component of the original) make theoretical sense -- though you spend a lot of the early going wondering ""OK how are they going to work Manchurian into this?"" Think Halliburton. Denzel has been in the Gulf War before (see 1996s Courage Under Fire a better movie) which doesnt help the deja vu factor. Streep has a jolly and fairly funny old time in Oscar-nominated Angela Lansburys mother-from-hell role but the original was Lansburys peak. This comes just a week after the barely releasable Catwoman so you do appreciate Demmes craft. But you can argue that his maligned Charade revamp The Truth About Charlie was a quirkier and fresher attempt to do some refashioning. The rude truth is that paranoid politicos have had a much more fertile field day this year with Fahrenheit 9/11s reminder of the Florida presidential balloting And no remake has a prayer when the original has Sinatra in the convention hall.

The Manchurian Candidate has it all. 1 / 4 Back to Gallery The Manchurian Candidate Drama. Starring Denzel Washington Liev Schreiber andMeryl Streep. Directed by Jonathan Demme. R. 130 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. ) ""The Manchurian Candidate"" is a fever dream of a movie filmed in the hyper-real kinetic style of nightmares. Bad things happen and happen fast. Faces of friends become faces of enemies. Safe reality morphs without warning into something strange and menacing. As directed by Jonathan Demme ""The Manchurian Candidate"" suggests the possibility of pandemonium even in its quietest moments. Based on the 1962 Cold War classic directed by John Frankenheimer and starring Frank Sinatra ""The Manchurian Candidate"" is updated to accommodate a whole new set of modern-day terrors and fantasies. Denzel Washington plays a man suffering from nightmares but hes not the only one. The movie depicts a collective 21st century American nightmare in which political scientific and corporate power align to destroy the Constitution and the Bill of Rights -- not by challenging them but by subverting them so utterly that no one even notices theyre gone. The film is one of the few Hollywood movies to directly address the fact that were living in a post-Sept. 11 world. It takes place either in some near- future or alternate present in which America is simultaneously involved in several wars and terrorist attacks are common occurrences in American cities. An upcoming presidential campaign -- and a political partys need to seem tough on terrorism -- allows for the ascendancy of a young congressman Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber) a Gulf War veteran with a Medal of Honor to his credit. Engaging and forthright in public hes strangely distracted in private and under the thumb of his ruthless mother (Meryl Streep) a powerful U.S. senator. Washington plays Ben Marco a career soldier who remembers Shaw from the Gulf and recommended him for the Medal of Honor. Ever since Marco has been plagued by recurring nightmares of being tortured and brainwashed in Kuwait. He dreams that Shaws heroism never took place that it was all a lie implanted in his head. The dreams seem real but Marco tells himself he has Gulf War Syndrome and tries to ignore them. In a beautiful shot we see Washington as Marco sitting in his crummy apartment watching Shaw accept the vice presidential nomination. A lesser actor would glower or look mystified. Washington somehow does both. Its a look of concern skepticism aggrievement and puzzlement. He doesnt know what to think but thats not stopping him from thinking. Meeting up with a veteran from his old unit who is having identical nightmares spurs Marco to start asking questions. Thats really where the movie begins and so lets leave the story there. Obviously Shaws heroism was a lie. Equally obvious is that powerful forces are behind placing him at the threshold of power. Demme and screenwriters Daniel Pyne and Dean Georgaris set ""The Manchurian Candidate"" within a textured 21st century landscape in which snatches of conversation headlines and news snippets overheard seemingly at random create the impression of a mad frenzied world. We hear about a controversy about touch-screen voting machines and later of an election in which the winning candidate has 70 percent of the vote. Coincidence? In the background of one scene a comedian is on television making jokes about the conglomerate Manchurian Global. The comedian thinks hes practicing his free speech but hes as powerless and innocent as the schoolchildren we also see in passing putting on a play about the Bill of Rights. In the original version of ""The Manchurian Candidate"" the fear was communism. In the remake its tyranny in the form of Dwight Eisenhowers old fear the ""military-industrial complex."" In a deliberately provocative parallel the movie treats Manchurian Global as a stand-in for Vice President Dick Cheneys former company Halliburton. News reports talk about Manchurian being granted no-bid contracts and being accused of price gouging. Furthermore like President Bush Shaw is presented as a third-generation political figure part of an American dynasty. Yet these parallels dont really add up to anything resembling a cohesive statement and more than the first ""Manchurian Candidate"" the remake shakes down as a conventionally plotted thriller. Its the performances that make it exceptional. As a man being driven half-mad who can seem almost crazy in his drive to prove himself not crazy Washington is the ideal locus of audience sympathy. As the candidate Schreiber could be considered a villain but he makes the characters confusion and horror come through. Even the minor players are made vivid -- not just Jon Voight as a liberal senator but Vera Farmiga as the senators daughter. But no one can talk about the acting in ""The Manchurian Candidate"" without rhapsodizing about Streep (in the role originated by Angela Lansbury). She has the Hillary hair and the Karen Hughes attack-dog energy but the charm the inspiration and the constant invention are her own. She gives us a senator whos a monomaniac a mad mommy and master politician rolled into one a woman firing on so many levels that no one can keep up -- someone who loves being evil as much as Streep loves acting. Shes a pleasure to watch -- and to marvel at -- every second shes onscreen. -- Advisory This movie contains violence and strong language.

YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Bruno Ganz Denzel Washington Jeffrey Wright or Create your own Manage alerts | What is this? (CNN) -- The Jonathan Demme remake of John Frankenheimers classic 1962 drama ""The Manchurian Candidate"" lacks some of the heart and soul of the original but it still manages to be entertaining thanks in large part to the talents of Denzel Washington Meryl Streep and Liev Schreiber.The original was set during the Cold War in the period following the Korean conflict and not long after the Joseph McCarthy-induced paranoia regarding communist infiltration of the U.S. government that sent the nation into turmoil.This time frame this time is present day and the war in question is the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Instead of communism the threat is a multinational company Manchurian Global which makes huge profits whenever America is at war.The companys name is a clever way for the filmmakers to justify keeping the original title as this story has nothing to do with Manchuria where some of the first movies action took place.While the movie is careful not to affiliate the characters with any particular political party the comparisons to todays political climate and the controversy over the U.S. governments ties to firms such as Halliburton may appear obvious to fans of Michael Moores ""Fahrenheit 9/11.""This is another advantage the original has over this remake -- communists made much better film bogymen than faceless corporations.Washington steps into Frank Sinatras shoes as the disturbed Maj. Bennett Marco.Streep takes on the role of the massively ambitious Sen. Eleanor Prentiss Shaw -- in the original the character was a senators wife and Angela Lansbury received a best supporting actress Oscar nomination for the role.Schreiber plays her son the aloof Raymond Shaw first portrayed by Laurence Harvey.The film opens with Marco speaking to a group of Boy Scouts about his experiences from the war and the exploits of one of the men under his command Shaw who won the Medal of Honor for his heroic actions during an ambush in Kuwait.Leaving the lecture hall Marco is waylaid by another man from that unit Cpl. Al Melvin played by the always interesting Jeffrey Wright (""Basquiat"").Disheveled and nervous Melvin tells Marco about his horrifying nightmares regarding that now-famous battle. His awful dreams and his daytime memories of that event dont add up.Marco suggests that Melvin seek help with his problems but fails to mention that he is plagued with the same disturbing nightmares.Marco has become convinced that he and his entire squad were somehow hypnotized into believing Shaw deserved the Medal of Honor when he knows in his gut the opposite is true. Denzel Washington as Maj. Bennett Marco embarks on a quest to confront Shaw.No one believes Marcos story Hes been receiving medical treatment from military psychiatrists and taking medication for what has been diagnosed as post-traumatic stress syndrome.But Marco knows the facts and his memories dont jibe and he embarks on a quest to confront Shaw in an effort to unravel the mystery surrounding his deteriorating mental state.En route to New York to find Shaw Marco meets a young woman Rose (Kimberly Elise) who befriends him and tells him that if needs a place to clean up before his meeting he can use her cousins apartment where Rose is temporarily staying. In the original Rose was played by Janet Leigh.Marco takes her up on her offer and after his shower discovers an odd bump underneath the skin beneath his shoulder. He cuts it out and finds a tiny implant.Why on earth its taken so long for him to notice this obvious object buried under his skin is a glaring plot goof best left ignored.Marco then visits a rogue scientist Richard Delp (Bruno Ganz) to ask about the device. How he knows Delp is not really made clear and requires another leap of faith. The scientist confirms the high-tech device is extremely suspicious but hes clueless as to its purpose.Meanwhile due to the backroom manipulations of his powerful mother Raymond is now a vice presidential candidate in a heated election. Meryl Streep plays the massively ambitious Sen. Eleanor Prentiss Shaw whose manipulations put her son in line to be a vice presidential candidate.This is where the plot really jumps into high gear as the race to uncover the truth heats up before Raymond a Manchurian Global puppet is given the second highest office in the land.Demmes strong direction keeps the action flowing and as always Streep and Washington deliver the goods.Schreiber in a way has the hardest role and his performance at times feels like one emotional note played again and again.My only other major complaint is the sappy Hollywood ending slapped on in the final scene. It is totally unnecessary and the film would have been better served if it had been left on the cutting room floor.Some film purists may be disappointed in this remake. In fact Lansbury has gone on record saying she wishes it had never been made.But for many especially those unfamiliar with the 1962 version this film delivers an interesting and exciting political potboiler that is being released at a perfect time.""The Manchurian Candidate"" opens nationwide on Friday July 30 and is rated ""R"" with a running time of 135 minutes.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for 1.99 Review Perfect Man fatally flawed CNN/Money What TVs most popular dads earn Poll Most prefer to watch movies at home Cruise Holmes engaged to marryCNN/Money Security alert issued for 40 million credit cards Bin Laden deputy sends message U.S. House votes to keep U.N. dues Iran poll to go to run-off ALL AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE DC FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY International Edition Languages --------- Arabic German Japanese Korean Turkish CNN TV CNN International Headline News Transcripts Advertise With Us About Us SEARCH The Web CNN.com (c) 2005 Cable News Network LP LLLP.

"Manchurian Candidate The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; manchurian-candidate-the ) Manchurian Candidate The (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli As remakes go The Manchurian Candidate is better than most. It remains faithful to the premise and themes of the original but by avoiding a slavish re-interpretation it offers some surprises to those who are familiar with the 1962 version. Yet theres still a problem and it has to do with the ending. 42 years ago The Manchurian Candidate capped off a Hitchcockian climax with a grim-but-reasonable conclusion. Here the climax is just as taut and the payoff is equally tragic but its immediately followed by a cheat. (If you see the movie youll immediately recognize what Im carefully avoiding stating explicitly.) Theres a falseness to the denouement of Jonathan Demmes The Manchurian Candidate that diminishes everything that has gone before it. It wouldnt surprise me to learn that the reactions of focus groups compelled Demme to re-shoot the last few moments. The result regardless of how it was arrived at is gutless. Lets hope no one tries to remake Chinatown with the same mentality. Putting the ending aside as difficult as that may be to do The Manchurian Candidate does a lot of things right. It corrects some of the most blatantly hokey aspects of its predecessor and weaves a storyline that is fundamentally similar yet sufficiently different that it does not feel like a bad carbon copy. Demme and his screenwriters have modernized the tale substituting corporate corruption for Communist aggression and using technology rather than hocus-pocus for brainwashing. And the politics have been updated in ways that not only make them more topical but more brutal. Compared to todays electoral hardball the game of four decades ago was almost civilized. The movie opens in pre-Desert Storm Kuwait with a U.S. military team led by Captain Ben Marco (Denzel Washington) and Sgt. Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber) scouting Iraqi troop strength. Their convoy comes under attack and they are captured. Three days later all but two of them are found alive having been rescued from the enemy singlehandedly by Raymond Shaw - or so the soldiers believe. Raymond is given a Congressional Medal of Honor for his heroics. Thirteen years later he is in the running for Vice President and Ben is having nightmares. The weary officers subconscious hints that something awful happened in Kuwait and that Raymond is not the hero everyone believes him to be. Mind control is involved. But when Ben attempts to discuss this with his former sergeant he is rebuffed by the candidates overprotective mother Eleanor (Meryl Streep) who is Livia to Raymonds Tiberius. She intends to see her son in the White House no matter what. In the original The Manchurian Candidate Raymond was the step-son of a Vice Presidential candidate. This time around he is the man at the bottom of the ticket. This change makes for a more engaging and suspenseful story. Most of the other substantive plot points change little if at all Ben is trying to stop Raymond from fulfilling his mission Raymonds mother is the most Machiavellian character in the story and the ending involves a potential assassination. In this film the ""Manchurian"" of the title refers not to Communist China but to a megacorporation with its fingers in nearly every imaginable pie. No longer happy with having their interests represented in the usual way they have decided that having a brainwashed president under their control would be a great achievement. Theres nothing wrong with any of the performances. Denzel Washington fills in nicely for Frank Sinatra although he plays Ben somewhat differently. Washingtons portrayal is more understated than Sinatras; theres a little more humanity and less bravado. Liev Schreiber effectively captures the essence of a man who has had a critical part of his mind and soul ripped out. And Meryl Streep crafts an Eleanor that is mid-way between Angela Lansburys emasculating matriarch and Hillary Clinton. (Streep has denied basing any aspect of Eleanor on Mrs. Clinton but some of the similarities are hard to dismiss.) This is one domineering woman and the possibility of an incestuous relationship with Raymond is openly suggested. The only one who doesnt work is Kimberly Elise whose character of Rosie often seems out of place and off-key. Shes extraneous and doesnt belong. Its hard to say whether this is the fault of the actress the writing or both. (The part in the original The Manchurian Candidate was played by Janet Leigh.) Jon Voight provides solid support in a small role. Director Demme has never been one to avoid a challenge - his career highlights include arguably the best concert film ever made (Stop Making Sense) and adaptations of The Silence of the Lambs and Beloved. This is his second attempt at a remake - his 2002 film The Truth about Charlie was based on Charade. The Manchurian Candidate however is a far more recognizable classic than Charade and it would take a brave man or a foolish one to risk the wrath of film buffs by making a new version. Demme is certainly no fool which may explain why the 2004 version of The Manchurian Candidate is almost good enough to earn a recommendation. (And the ""almost"" would have disappeared with a better ending.)

John Frankenheimers original was one of the most bracingly inventive American movies of the last 50 years a witches brew of Cold War paranoia Freudian camp hipster absurdism and a nihilism so subversive that it spooked even the films star Frank Sinatra who helped keep it in the vault for nearly a quarter-century following its initial release. It would be impossible to recapture such far-out audacity and Demme wisely doesnt try. The new movie takes place in an exaggerated version of todays security-mad America with suicide bombs blasting Denver and corporations pulling the puppet strings of political life. If that werent scary enough Army Major Bennett Marco (Denzel Washington) is caught in an even more terrifying nightmare. In the run-up to the 1991 Gulf War he and his Army recon team got ambushed by the Iraqis and were saved by the derring-do of one Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber) who guided them through enemy territory to safety. Or so Marco remembers. But can he trust his memory? Or did somebody brainwash his unit back in Kuwait? To keep from completely losing it Major Marco begins dogging Shaw now a robotically liberal vice-presidential candidate pushed forward by his overbearing mother conservative Senator Eleanor Prentiss Shaw (Meryl Streep). Marcos pursuit of Shaw plunges him into the phantasmagoric whorls of a conspiracy populated by a perky-mysterious supermarket clerk (the fine Kimberly Elise) a peacenik senator (Jon Voight not acting loony for once) and a scientist pal played by Bruno Ganz who resembles an old toad happy to have been brought up croaking from the bottom of some dank ancient well. Meanwhile lurking in the background is the enigmatic business concern Manchurian Global -- whose closest political ally is Eleanor Prentiss Shaw.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm Although dulled by a soft-minded epilogue The Manchurian Candidate marks a splendid return to form for Demme a filmmaker Ive rooted for ever since the 1970s when idiosyncratic pictures like Handle With Care Melvin and Howard and Something Wild held the fort of personal filmmaking against the invasion of infantile blockbusterism that made the 1980s the worst movie decade in American history. He was apparently knocked off balance by the success of that 1991 juggernaut The Silence of the Lambs and followed it up with a pair of unimportant Big Important Films. While Philadelphia was distressingly conventional (it proved that gay people are human too) the 1998 Oprah Winfrey vehicle Beloved took scads of chances but was crushingly dull -- shocking from a director whod cut his teeth making movies like Caged Heat and Crazy Mama. By the time Demme reached The Truth About Charlie his 2002 remake of another 60s touchstone you heard people whispering that maybe hed lost his chops. But for all that films faults Demme wasnt really trying to redo Stanley Donens Charade. He was trying to rethink it give it a whole new spirit. Which is precisely what he pulls off in The Manchurian Candidate.   Frankenheimers original movie was based on a 1959 best-seller by the late Richard Condon a vivid pop novelist who wore his cynicism as jauntily as Sinatra did his fedora. Steeped in the anti-communist paranoia of the 1950s Condons novel both tapped into and sent up the Cold War hysterias of both left and right. The book was crazy-clever and in adapting it screenwriter George Axelrod (Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? Lord Love a Duck) added whole new dimensions of lunacy. While Demmes version (written by Daniel Pyne and Dean Georgaris) preserves the storys original arc it plays things much straighter -- its more thriller than send-up. Demme makes no attempt to mimic Frankenheimers gaudy Wellesian imagery or capture the hallucinatory wit of the original garden-party brainwashing scene. This Manchurian Candidate is consciously modeled on the Cinema of Paranoia spawned by the Nixon years including The Parallax View The Conversation Three Days of the Condor and William Richerts Winter Kills (an underrated personal favorite also based on a novel by Condon). Demme and photographer Tak Fujimoto ratchet up the sense of uncertainty and dread with looming close-ups of characters facing the camera as potentially sinister figures enter the background. We share Major Marcos edgy disorientation a feeling captured by the movies slyly ambiguous tagline ""Everything is under control."" The question of course is whos controlling whom? Without spoiling things I can tell you that this new Manchurian Candidate portrays a corporatized America dominated by companies like Big-Mart a chain that takes in trillions each quarter; a touch-screen voting company analogous to the real-life company Diebold; and above all Manchurian Global which comes off as an unholy hybrid of Halliburton and the Carlyle Group. In such a world politics is mere shadow play. It doesnt matter which party Raymond Shaw or his mother belongs to -- Manchurian Global is a contributor to both. With its timely references to terrorism and run-wild corporations the filmmakers are clearly hoping to update the hell-raising spirit of the original which gleefully punched Americas hottest buttons -- fear of the Reds diabolical scheming and fear of McCarthyite extremism. But what seemed daring 40 years ago has become routine in our post-assassination post-Vietnam post-Watergate post-9/11 world. These days heady cynicism is the culture given -- the TV program 24 makes The Manchurian Candidate seem like All the Presidents Men. Because we already live in an era of nonstop political paranoia and conspiracy mongering fiction must struggle to equal let alone outstrip reality. Thats why this Manchurian Candidates most relevant theme is its anxiety about brainwashing a fear that makes perfect sense in an era of inescapable media messages mood-altering drugs and microchips implanted in the human body. (Indeed nothing that befalls Major Marco proves nearly as disturbing as what happens to Jim Carreys Joel Barish in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind where the brainwashing isnt political but personal -- an assault on individual identity.) Still if Demmes version lacks the wallop of its predecessor it is more likely to be popular with contemporary audiences who will enjoy not only its labyrinthine twists but its stars burnished professionalism. Although Washington cant rival Sinatras jaded nicotine-cured angst he always relishes the chance to burst the mummy-tape of his physical perfection. As Major Marco he gets to. He takes the trademark Denzel role (the genuinely righteous man) then has him walk the line between sanity and madness. When someone accidentally bumps him on the street his ranting makes bystanders scurry away. And yet he seems far saner than Raymond Shaw the apparently emotionless hero-turned-politico who could all too easily become an unlikable cipher. That happened in the original where he was played by dry-ice pretty boy Laurence Harvey. Shaw gets a better deal from Schreiber whose bitter mien suggests inner torment and an elephants memory for grievance. You can see why he shone as Hamlet. Playing Shaw as a welter of painful memories and bottled-up passions (Schreibers small mouth accentuating his inability to express his real feelings) he brings nuance even pathos to a joyless man caged within the bars of himself. Hes been locked in there of course by his mother. When The Manchurian Candidate came out in the 60s part of its iconoclasm lay in Angela Lansburys garishly harsh portrait of star-spangled motherhood -- apple pie laced with ground glass. Such domineering mothers have become a pop commonplace -- reaching some sort of apotheosis in Nancy Marchands Livia Soprano. No fool Streep doesnt attempt to trump Lansburys chilling turn as the maternal Queen of Hearts. Instead she plays Eleanor Prentiss Shaw as an infinitely more cutthroat Liddy Dole or Hillary Clinton a modern-day Lady Macbeth who schemes on behalf of the son she both idolizes and treats (to lift a line from Grace Paley) as the prize cut of beef in the meat locker of her heart. Although she spent much of her early career being asked to suffer in close-ups Streep is an extraordinarily witty actress who can deliver a good line like a stiletto through the ribs. And her best lines capture whats always been fun about The Manchurian Candidate -- our rollicking pleasure in its wickedness. There may be no more splendidly ruthless moment in a movie this year than when Senator Shaw explains the facts of life to her son. ""The assassin always dies baby"" she says. ""Its necessary for the national healing.""

Jonathan Demmes garishly colored remake of John Frankenheimers nightmarish black-and-white 1962 Cold War chiller based on Richard Condons classic 1959 novel arrives in a 2004 season of high-pitched presidential nominating conventions held in nervous big cities and 9/11 commission findings released to an anxious public. A climate of strident political partisanship mixed with fears about terrorist threats provides ""Perfect Storm""-worthy conditions for a scary summer flick about mind control and corporate conspiracy. For grim absurdist relief there are the machinations of Meryl Streep as an infernal U.S. senator bearing a hilariously undeniable physical resemblance to the junior U.S. senator from New York Hillary Rodham Clinton; for a dash of the neo-rococo there are the visual tics and fillips of the director who presided over ""The Silence of the Lambs."" But what this ""Manchurian Candidate"" for a new generation makes up for in timing it lacks in discipline and edge. Even without comparing the production with Frankenheimers taut mad-paranoid illogical beaut (after all a movie ought to be judged on its own merits) the new version balloons to such bloated proportions of global conspiracy theory and tricked-out action sequences that the bracing sting of cautionary satire is dulled. Compare this ""Candidate"" with the original on the other hand (after all the remake of such a famous period piece benefits from an appreciation of the original) and the new doesnt compare with the shock of the old. In the original U.S. soldiers were ambushed in the Korean War and hypnotized by sneaky Communists capable of turning properly brainwashed men into obedient automatons with the mere shuffle of a deck of playing cards; now the ambushed Americans are in Kuwait in 1991 their free will overruled by microchips secretly implanted under their skin. Back then Frank Sinatra played the restless nightmare-prone soldier Ben Marco just on the edge of figuring out what really happened to him and his men during the war; now Denzel Washington does the honors the actors default righteous passivity robbing Major Marco of some essential heat. The role of fellow platoon member and rising politician Raymond Shaw has been passed from the languorous Laurence Harvey to the more excitable Liev Shreiber; and Streep picks up the terrifying mantle of maniac mother so famously worn by Angela Lansbury. ""The real danger [in this country] comes from suspending civil liberties"" Jon Voight intones as a principled politician on the side of liberal values in one of the passing references to present-day issues of privacy and national security through which the script by Daniel Pyne (""The Sum of All Fears"") and Dean Georgaris (""Paycheck"") teases us with relevance. Yet opportunities to comment forcefully - passionately bravely - on issues of contemporary importance whether about governmental intrusion into the lives of private citizens or manipulation of the electoral process are diffused and ultimately lost amid an excessive interest in say the hermetic decor of Marcos depressing apartment. Frankenheimer blended bitterness with satire in his portrayal of the Communist menace. In Demmes retelling apart from the appearance of outspoken liberal talk-show host Al Franken as a neutral network reporter the leavening humor is limited to Streeps severely zany broomstick-a-flyin characterization of Sen. Eleanor Prentiss Shaw political dragon lady and gorgon mom. Hair molded into a Hillary-short ready-for-battle coif Streep bites with mischievous fury into her role the quintessential monster pol of our era played by Americas quintessential chameleon movie star of a certain age. Speaking kinder-gentler-type rhetoric about wanting to make the country ""safer braver stronger"" while browbeating every man around her her Senator Shaw carries the entire promise of the movies excitement on her shoulders. And although Streep does great things - sometimes just by the way she chews on ice cubes in a restaurant - the actress cannot schlepp this picture on her own. Schreiber too throws himself strenuously into his work. But absent Harveys lighter psychological touch in the original Raymond Shaws torments shade into actorly exercises. ""The Manchurian Candidate"" is meant to creep us out by building on a foundation of paranoia just this side of solid. Demme builds his model on stilts of fancy that let too much hot air blow through.

This is brainy popcorn fare that given its outstanding cast and exploitably relevant content should play well with all audiences through the summer and beyond even if a couple of commercial doubts linger; the original despite wide acclaim disappointed on initial release and its possible the storys real-life implications may cut too close to the bone. Despite its basis in the Richard Condon novel and George Axelrod script that drove the 1962 film Demmes picture with its ambiguous mood and unsettling tension also recalls Alan J. Pakulas shadow-world suspensers of the 70s ""Klute"" ""The Parallax View"" and ""All the Presidents Men."" By outfitting the superbly insinuating basic story with a battery of up-to-the-minute concerns that readily feed on present fears and suspicions Demme and screenwriters Daniel Pyne and Dean Georgaris inject new life into a recently dormant genre -- the paranoid thriller -- that talented filmmakers might do well to revisit more regularly. After making his biggest career stumble last year with ""The Truth About Charlie"" (a remake of another cherished 60s title ""Charade"") Demme has bounced back with a picture that in unexpected ways stands as a companion piece to ""The Silence of the Lambs."" Both films in the end are about mind control and manipulation about the diverse ways that evil can be instilled in well-intended people. The two works bore deeply into the heads -- literally in this case -- of their central characters to scary effect in both instances. Both ""Candidates"" begin on the battlefield in wars set about a decade prior to their making; then it was Korea; now its the Gulf War. In a quick flash of nocturnal action a platoon led by Army Capt. Bennett Marco (Denzel Washington) is attacked in Iraqi-held territory in Kuwait. In the confusion it appears most of the crew is saved by the heroics of Sgt. Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber). Shaw is given the Medal of Honor and Marco long after extols the bravery of his comrade-in-arms. A dozen or so years later however the mens positions have significantly changed. Marco is now a Major serving in Washington D.C. In one of the biggest story changes from the original Shaw is a two-term congressman from New York whose doting whim-of-steel mother Eleanor (Meryl Streep) herself a senator contrives to maneuver onto the ticket as her partys vice-presidential candidate at the expense of the original favorite veteran old-style liberal senator Thomas Jordan (Jon Voight). Marco suddenly receives a surprise visit from a member of the old platoon Melvin (Jeffrey Wright) a disturbed man afflicted with dreadful dreams reflected in his gruesome drawings. This triggers a weird flashback in Marco of him and his fellow soldiers hooked up to strange equipment in some sort of lab during the war a vision echoed by a modern scene in which Shaw enters a secret room to have a tiny implant installed in his brain by a smoothly sinister doctor (Simon McBurney) familiar from Marcos dream. In terms of dramatic trajectory this new ""Candidate"" wisely retains Axelrods immaculate construction while reconceiving the nature of individual scenes and source of the overriding evil. The ""Manchurian"" element in the original referred to the region of China and the communists brainwashing of American soldiers; here in typical post-60s conspiracy theory style the enemy lies within specifically with a huge corporation called Manchurian Global (read Halliburton) that specializes in servicing the military. So instead of Frankenheimers surreal gatherings of Red operatives and proper society ladies where Yank G.I.s murder their buddies on command Demme offers a not-implausible world where a splinter-sized implant can not only alter a subjects emotions but unconsciously force them to do anothers bidding. Such is Manchurians intent once Shaw is in place a heartbeat from the presidency. Rebuffed by his old friend Shaw and instructed by the Army to get help for what it insists is Gulf War Syndrome Marco keeps puzzling over the macabre visions sketched by Melvin who soon turns up dead. On a train to New York Marco is picked up by the friendly Rosie and he finally gets to sit down with Shaw whose normal impervious demeanor breaks down in an erratic confessional in which he both reveals his resentment over his mothers domination and expresses his disdain for the ""little people"" his party is supposed to represent. Although theres no question which side of ideological spectrum Demme and his collaborators represent they have scrambled the political cross-currents in ways that energize the picture and provocatively mess with viewers expectations. Although its not identified the out-of-power party to which Shaw and his mother Ellie belong is clearly meant to the Democrats. All the same Ellie (a role brilliantly originated by Angela Lansbury) is a hard-line militaristic patriot who depises wimpy liberalism and is in deep with Manchurian. Add to that the unmistakable impression that Streep in her riveting portrait of unbridled ambition and a bulldozer negotiating style is channeling Hillary Clinton and you have one thorny thicket of allegiances to pick through. Further unease is created by crucial scenes that take place at the party convention and on election day. Soundtrack is laced with background references to U.S. military incursions in such places as Indonesia and Guinea as well as incidents of domestic violence. As the action pushes relentlessly toward the climax which like the original takes place at a huge political rally with an assassin lurking in the rafters the layers of conspiracy and questions about how far the complicity extends have been pushed to their limits by scripters who have added character twists that impact decisively on the ending. With his usual lenser Tak Fujimoto emphasizing close-ups and some well-judged image altering punching up key moments from time to time Demme has delivered a visually arresting picture further fleshed out by a dense sound mix and an unobtrusively supportive score by Rachel Portman with help from Wyclef Jean whose version of John Fogertys ""Fortunate Son"" over the end credits is a grabber. As he proved in ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and elsewhere Demme knows how to serve up the genre goods on a bed of rich cultural trappings flavored by spicy political smarts. Playing another ambiguous hero saddled with doubts and emotional vacuums Washington in the role Frank Sinatra originated provides this often vertiginous story with a strong center of gravity in a skillful performance that necessitates juggling the characters fundamental reliability and frequent befuddlement. Looking leaner than before Schreiber comes very close to reproducing the passive demeanor and chilled soul evoked by Laurence Harvey the first time around. Fine actors fill out the important supporting parts with Wright haunting as the former soldier so deranged that he clearly sees the truth Voight nicely iconic as the steady old politician Vera Farmiga vivid as the latters daughter whom Shaw considers the lost love of his youth Bruno Ganz appropriately strange as a refugee scientist who helps Marco and Elise vibrant in the old Janet Leigh role of a young woman who may or may not have Marcos interests at heart. Demme stalwarts Dean Stockwell Ted Levine Charles Napier and early mentor Roger Corman pop up in small roles.
