When his fellow company directors insist he secures the deed to an historic restaurant in Central Park he sets about using his smarmy methods of persuasion. But the crotchety owner (Angela Lansbury) is having none of it. To make matters worse his ex-wife (Carla Gugino) continues to lambast him for showing no interest in their kids. Luckily for him those penguins arrival instigates a remarkable volte-face that not only brings our preoccupied hero down to earth but shows every sign of healing the family rift. Ahh - or rather arghOnce youve reached down and gathered up the remnants of your jaw theres a thin veneer of amusement to be had from watching a gaggle of awkward Antarctic flappers lay waste to a modern apartment cause a furore at a posh business party and generally waddle about dispensing Chaplin-style slapstick at every turn. Easy-to-please knee-highs will almost certainly chuckle at all the farting pooing squawking and bumping into things and I confess to smirking a couple of times too. But holy mother of pearl talk about superficial claptrap Still at least theres a deep-seated moral attached to this pea-brained parable if your business is failing and your love life waning just pick up a penguin. Slap Ouch Sorry couldnt resist.

By Peter Rainer Film critic June 17 2011 Save for later Saved Actor Jim Carrey in a scene from Mr. Poppers Penguins. Barry Wetcher/20th Century Fox/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Jim Carrey at his best is one of the funniest performers on the planet. Like most great comics he also decided fairly early that he wanted to be taken ""seriously"" as an actor and so he traded in ""Ace Ventura"" and ""Dumb and Dumber"" for films like ""The Majestic"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."" Its probably no use trying to convince him at this late date especially when his limbs may not be limber that theres more artistry in his rubber-man goofiness than in his Oscar-bait earnestness. In ""Mr. Poppers Penguins"" hes playing a divorced real estate shark who flips New York landmarks and has fallen out of favor with both his kids (Maxwell Perry Cotton Madeline Carroll) and ex-wife (Carla Gugino). A surprise inheritance from his globe-trotting father - a shipment of penguins from the Antarctic - brings out his cuddly side and inevitably bonds the family.Its probably futile by now to hope that Carrey might showcase his comedy in movies that arent as mushy with family-entertainment values as this one. But the good news is that even though one must pace oneself through the dull parts usually involving Mr. Poppers dullish family hes in pretty good form whenever hes getting physical - like when he mimics a runner in super-slow-motion - and especially when hanging out with a half dozen penguins which is much of the time. (Its also good news that the birds though CGI-enabled are actual gentoo penguins.) Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Mark Waters who directed from material based on the celebrated childrens book by Richard and Florence Atwater has a flair for goofiness that matches Carreys own and there are scenes between the birds and Mr. Popper in his sleek Manhattan duplex that are peerlessly silly. (In some ways the film reminded me of the 1989 Tom Hanks comedy ""Turner amp; Hooch"" which featured Hanks as a neatness freak and the plug-ugly dog that invades his space.) Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? I wish there had been even more going on here with Carrey - maybe an outing to the zoo where he gets to imitate every animal in captivity. Hes held captive by the maudlin moments in ""Mr. Poppers Penguins"" but he breaks through when it counts. Grade B (Rated PG for mild rude humor and some language.)

Sure you do. Disney makes a lot of them. The man has to take care of a child he never knew he had or he inherits a mischievous dog or his crazy mother moves in with him or whatever. You know the genre. Well Mr. Poppers Penguins is such a brazenly moronic and uninspired example of it that youd swear it was a parody of brazenly moronic and uninspired family movies. Anyone setting out to spoof the genres conventions by ticking off plot points from a checklist and padding the dialogue with inanities will find that whatever he conceives mockingly is less dumb than what Mr. Poppers Penguins presents with a straight face. After years of hard work Jim Carrey sighs gives up and plays Mr. Popper a skilled real-estate shark with a reputation for being able to buy any property in New York. His bosses adore him and theyre open to the idea of making him a full partner in the company. First though hell need to buy one last hard-to-get property -- Central Parks Tavern on the Green restaurant -- from its owner who has no interest in selling. If he doesnt make this sale he wont get the promotion Mr. Popper is good at his job bad at his life. Hes divorced from Carla Gugino which doesnt make any sense at all. He is also terrible at communicating with his young son Billy (Maxwell Perry Cotton) and adolescent daughter Janie (Madeline Carroll). Why youd get the impression that family isnt all that important to him -- and no wonder since his own father was a globetrotting explorer who neglected him his whole life. Lets just hope there isnt some situation later on where Mr. Poppers lack of family values will endanger his promotion Then Mr. Poppers absentee father finally has the common decency to die and in his will he leaves Mr. Popper six penguins. ""To my son whom I neglected his entire life I bequeath a terrible burden that will drive him crazy and that he is probably not even legally permitted to have within city limits"" or words to that effect. Popper doesnt want six penguins. He doesnt even want one penguin. But before someone from the local zoo can show up to take the birds off his hands young Billy and Janie come over to visit and since its Billys birthday he assumes the penguins are his gift and hes overjoyed and well Mr. Popper cant very well get rid of them NOW can he?? So yes Billy these antarctic water fowl are your birthday present They belong to you But ... they will live here with me in my penthouse apartment where you hardly ever are. Happy birthday Meanwhile what about Tavern on the Green? The owner is a very fancy old lady named Mrs. Van Gundy. She is played by Angela Lansbury but only because Margaret Dumont is dead. Mrs. Van Gundy knows shell have to sell Tavern on the Green sooner or later what with her being 108 years old and everything but she wants to make sure its to the right person. She considers the restaurant staff to be like family. Therefore shell only sell to someone who -- wait for it -- believes that family is very important Meanwhile what about the penguins? Those birds are a handful thats for sure They squawk poop and eat a lot. To keep them alive Popper has to maintain a frigid temperature in his apartment and he finally just covers the floors in ice and snow because thats easy and makes sense and is perfectly rational. But he starts to bond with the little bastards too and they adore him because he feeds them. He starts bonding with his actual children as well and starts to woo back their mother now that the penguins have made him nicer and more compassionate or whatever it is theyve done to him. Meanwhile what is Mr. Popper doing about his apartment buildings strict no-pets policy? First he bribes the doorman (who might also be the landlord?) to pretend not to notice them when he takes them in and out of the building on outings around the city which he does rather a lot for someone who is trying to keep them a secret. Apart from that he just has to dodge Kent (David Krumholtz) the ONE tenant in the ENTIRE high-rise who suspects that Popper has pets but who never seems to be around when Popper parades them through the lobby. Doh Perhaps you are wondering how much of the movie you will have to sit through before Jim Carrey finally gets hit in the crotch. The answer is 10 minutes. Perhaps you are also wondering how long you will have to wait before Jim Carrey gets pooped on by a penguin. The answer to that is 15 minutes. Mr. Poppers Penguins gets right to the point. And youll be glad to know that one of those penguins turns around aims his vile cloaca directly at Mr. Popper and purposely poops fish-scented feces upon him. The director Mark Waters (Mean Girls Ghosts of Girlfriends Past) makes sure to get the camera right up there on that penguins butt. Its CGI of course -- actual penguins are used occasionally in the movie but all their facial expressions and choreographed wackiness and excretory orifices are computer-generated -- which means it was someones job to tell a computer how to draw the thing that a penguin poops out of. ""Make sure it kind of vibrates when the excrement comes out"" is something I imagine director Mark Waters telling his team of animators. Meanwhile what about the guy from the zoo official penguin expert Nat Jones (Clark Gregg)? He would LOVE to get these six birds for the zoo not just because theyll be popular with visitors but because THEY WILL DIE IF THEY CONTINUE TO LIVE IN MR. POPPERS APARTMENT. I feel like that point is not made strenuously enough. Penguin expert Nat Jones is portrayed as a villain for wanting to take poor Mr. Poppers pets away but hes also you know RIGHT. Meanwhile whats happening with Mr. Poppers attempts to buy Tavern on the Green from Mrs. Murder-She-Wrote? Shes being stubborn so Mr. Popper attempts to charm her at a fancy fundraiser shes sponsoring at the Guggenheim Museum. ""I cant have anything go wrong this evening"" she declares in case we are too stupid to understand the stakes. And then guess who shows up and makes things go wrong? The penguins They follow Mr. Popper across town and wander into the museum and mayhem ensues. Oh no Mr. Popper will NEVER get that promotion now Hang on I almost forgot the part where one of the penguins sees some flying birds (i.e. REAL birds) on TV and wishes it could fly too and we say ""Aww"" And then at the end during the madcap escape from evil Mr. Trying-to-Save-the-Penguins-Lives this penguin gets tangled up with a kite and actually does get to fly Sort of I mean the kite flies and the penguin is attached to it and I guess that counts. Its very heartwarming So heres a movie (which bears no resemblance to the 1938 childrens novel its allegedly based on by the way) full of dumb people doing dumb things that real people would never do and learning dumb lessons from them and in the process becoming better (but still dumb) people and penguins make cute CGI faces and poop a lot and what else do you need? You should definitely take all of your children and pay 10 apiece for the whole family to watch this movie. This is definitely a movie that is worth 40 or 50 bucks.

More like Mr. Pooperas Penguins If you think that joke is funny a and youare in elementary school a youall likely love Jim Carreyas farts-and-flippers comedy which though exceedingly dumb is at least very smart about what appeals to 4- to 10-year-old kids fans of Happy Feet March of the Penguins and YouTube animal videos. George Popper played by Carrey is a gangly motormouth divorce and high-powered real-estate agent who hopes to turn Central Parks Tavern on the Green into a giant residential tower (George is apparently unaware of the Landmarks Commission). Real estate is dry fodder for a kids movie but fear not Director Mark Waters (Mean Girls) is not concerned with meta-minded Shrek-style comedies drenched in adult-friendly references. This is straight-up silly slapstick from the moment the penguins (a mix of CGI and live animals) arrive to revive Poppers heart destroy his apartment poop in his toilet fart on his enemies and reunite his family. Carrey fills his apartment with ice snow and huge silly-putty grins. As Poppers mental state unravels and he reconnects with his ex-wife Amanda (Carla Gugino) the actor nearly pulls off a fine balance between lovable eccentric and nut job. Carrey is as tame as hes ever been here and thankfully minus the comic malice of his Grinch Count Olaf or Riddler. But when Popper breaks down in front of his kids I was reminded less of the haunted sadness of Jimmy Stewart one of Carreys acting heroes than the unhinged desperation of Mel Gibson in The Beaver. Another of Carreys heroes is Dick Van Dyke whose elastic exaggerated playfulness he has sometimes topped. What Carrey has never captured however is Van Dykes wide-open sunniness. And in the case of this film he certainly hasnt topped Van Dykes hoofing in Mary Poppins still the greatest tap-dancing-penguin scene in cinema history. But never mind; kids wont know what theyre missing.

"Mr. Poppers Penguins review Jim Carrey mars otherwise charming cute-animal movie |       NJ.com comments Mr. Poppers Penguins review Jim Carrey mars otherwise charming cute-animal movie Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on June 17 2011 at 804 AM updated June 17 2011 at 1055 AM View/Post Comments Barry WetcherThomas Popper played by Jim Carrey enjoys dinner with his new friends in ""Mr. Poppers Penguins."" There was a time when all you needed for a family film was a cute kid a rambunctious animal and a few exasperated adult actors who didnt mind playing second -- make that third -- fiddle. Remember ""Flippers New Adventure""? ""The Ugly Dachshund""? ""Clarence the Cross-Eyed Lion""? ""Zebra in the Kitchen""? (Thats okay. Nobody remembers ""Zebra in the Kitchen."") The point though was that the kids and the critters -- and occasionally an adult doing a pratfall -- were all that was required. The harmless ""Mr. Poppers Penguins"" repeats that old formula when a lonely dad ends up being the unwilling custodian of the six titular birds. They wreck his apartment and ruin his career -- but might just save his relationship with his children and restore his marriage. The only slight problem here is the star Jim Carrey. The idea behind the plot -- really its the whole point -- is that Mr. Popper is a cold unfeeling real-estate developer. Its only the arrival of these helpless cold-weather animals that ironically thaws him out and gets other people to warm to him. Movie Review Mr. Poppers Penguins (PG) Fox (95 min.) Directed by Mark Waters. With Jim Carrey Carla Gugino Angela Lansbury. Now playing in New Jersey. Rating note The film contains an awful lot of penguin poop. Stephen Whittys Review TWO AND A HALF STARS But Carrey like so many comic actors is still a comedian first and one with an unquenchable thirst for attention. Hes always ""on"" even when the character is supposed to be off; by the end of the movie there isnt a piece of scenery that doesnt bear his teethmarks. So because Carrey wont play mean or even dull theres no real room for the character to grow and change. Whats the point of the penguins if Popper doesnt seem that different at the end of the movie from how he was at the beginning? The penguins themselves the best things here are almost exclusively the work of animators -- something I reveal only to calm any nervous animal lovers. But you wouldnt know otherwise; this is really wonderfully done and the little guys caper about like silent comics. (In the movies best joke theyre entranced by Charlie Chaplin movies.) Apart from the overacting Carrey everyone dutifully plays their assigned parts. The forgettable kid actors are reliably photogenic Carla Gugino gamely takes on (another) thankless part as Carreys ex and Angela Lansbury is the crusty dowager who owns Tavern on the Green which Carreys company is trying to buy and tear down. Why the script deliberately chooses a real property -- which in fact is not privately owned but belongs to the City of New York and is currently shuttered -- is a puzzle I still cant figure out. But then Im not sure what Jim Carrey was thinking taking on a part that -- in a perfect world -- would have been played by someone like David Hyde Pierce. Perhaps someone needed to tell him This is not a Jim Carrey Movie. This is a Cute Animal Movie. And when youre at that point in your career when youre making cute animal movies all you can do is embrace your inner Dean Jones and get on with it.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 17 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 240PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Once upon a time casting Jim Carrey and penguins in the same movie would have been box-office overkill. Since then the rubber-faced one has lost much of his mojo but not those tuxedoed troupers - flightless creatures with soaring careers nothing will ever dim their pop wattage. So theres no mistaking who deserves top billing in Mr. Poppers Penguins. Whats more its kind of reassuring to know that star power can still save a picture. Even this thing. Dont be fooled by the classic source the celebrated childrens book from the thirties. In the name of ""updating"" the original the script drains off most of the charm to make room for all of the poop jokes. Yet before the goop comes the goof. Meet Carreys Popper no longer a humble housepainter in the sticks but a rising real-estate honcho in the Big Apple. Divorced from his wife Amelia (Carla Gugino) distanced from his teenage daughter and young son he lives alone in a Park Avenue penthouse rolling in dough but a quart low on love. Still Popper does have his faithful assistant Pippi an English missy with a lisp whose principal job is to perpetuate the titles alliterative propensity. Lisps Pippi ""Punctuality is a priority of this particular person"". Aint it perfectly phunny. Well obviously Popper could do with a lesson in family values and who better to teach it than his polar opposites and our loveable feathered friends? Enter penguin No. 1 in a refrigerated box sent as a parting gift from Poppers late dad the world explorer. The recipient hoists the bird dubbed Captain to eye level and SPLAT - the first penguin regales us with the first poop joke. Others will follow. Other penguins too five of them to make an even half-dozen. By happy coincidence their names - Bitey Loudy Stinky Lovey and Nimrod - pretty much double as a plot summary. Anyway when his children catch a glimpse of the cute sextet Popper is stuck with them - kids and critters alike. The latter taking a cue from their favourite movie actor - the Little Tramp who stole their walk - get right down to making reliable mischief. Of course theyre all about honking and biting and stinking et al. but to their credit they also raise their game impressively on occasion - for example playing soccer in Central Park or on a more artistic note body-surfing down the spiral ramps of the Guggenheim. Leaving you to wonder Are the penguins real? Sometimes and sometimes during the tricky scenes theyre CGI replicas. Then again all stars have their stunt doubles. And kudos to director Mark Waters for nicely fudging the distinction. Such is the magic of todays movie technology its getting so you cant tell a real penguin from a fake. Alas the same might be said of Jim Carrey. Used to be that his on-camera mania at least felt vital - his improvised riffs may have tested your patience but they never lacked energy. Here those same riffs seem much like him older and a bit tired their vitality more feigned than genuine. So when Popper throws open the windows of his penthouse to let in the Manhattan winter the penguins enjoy the polar climate but Carrey looks frozen out of his own movie - a stiffer and less elastic version of the younger dynamo. He could have used some of that CGI magic himself. Luckily the penguins march to his rescue. To be honest I prefer their work in documentaries where whether shivering in huddled colonies or gliding effortlessly though the watery depths they get to show off the full range of their acting talents - comedians one moment tragedians the next. Still even when theyre reduced to pooping in Park Avenue toilets you gotta give them their due - it takes a true star to outshine dull material.

Mr. Poppers Penguins (PG) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Mr. Poppers Penguins (PG) Jim Carrey shines in this adaptation of the classic childrens novel Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald6/28/2011 Editor rating 3 Penguins are intrinsically amusing. In general Jim Carrey is amusing too provided you can overlook that whole How the Grinch Stole Christmas debacle. In Mr. Poppers Penguins he and they add up to surprisingly fun family entertainment.The new comedy shares little with the classic childrens novel from 1938 the title and the birds being the main similarity. The modern-day Mr. Popper (Carrey) isnt a poor small-town housepainter but a wealthy Manhattan real-estate wheeler-dealer who neglects his family in shameless pursuit of the next hot property. His ex-wife (Carla Gugino) and two kids will always fall somewhere behind pleasing his bosses and making partner. Then his long-estranged adventurer father passes away and sends him a passel of penguins. Popper tries to dump them on a variety of agencies to no avail. By the time a shifty-looking guy from the zoo (Clark Gregg) shows up to take them Poppers kids have already fallen in love with the critters and Popper decides to keep them around turning his apartment into a winter playground. A fairly high tolerance for penguin poop is required of anyone who sits through this movie but to be fair if youre 9 years old penguin poop is hilarious the kid equivalent of say Tina Fey. Theres no real reason for an adult to show up at this movie without a kid in tow unless he or she is some sort of Jim Carrey fanatic and the less said about that the better. So prepare for flatulent penguins and soccer balls that wind their way toward Carreys testicles. Fortunately the movie throws adults a few bones along the way; this is by no means an unpleasant film to watch and the Ice Age short that runs with it is funny too.Director Mark Waters -- who tortured us with Ghosts of Girlfriends Past and delighted us with Mean Girls -- wisely gives Carrey plenty of chances to do his schtick as Popper tries to snow the intractable owner of Tavern on the Green (Angela Lansbury) into selling her property to his company. Yes the fact that Popper must learn whats important (his family) through an unconventional device (penguins) is a plot borrowed from the Carrey movie Liar Liar (and plenty of other films as well). But the penguins follow Popper to the Guggenheim and wreak havoc among the rich folks. Theres enough kid in all of us to appreciate that. Cast Jim Carrey Carla Gugino Angela Lansbury. Director Mark Waters. Screenwriters Sean Anders John Morris Jared Stern. Based on the novel by Florence and Richard Atwater. Producer John Davis. A 20th Century Fox release. Running time 95 minutes. Mild rude humor some language. Opens Friday July 17 at area theaters.

Starring Jim Carrey Carla Gugino Director Mark Waters Release Opened Jun 17 2011  Editorial Review Jim Carrey has this comedy down coldBy Michael OSullivanFriday June 17 2011Theres a reason Mr. Popper gets top billing over the penguins in ""Mr. Poppers Penguins."" (It could just as easily and just as alliteratively have been called ""The Penguins of Mr. Popper"" after all.) It isnt merely the fact that thats how authors Richard and Florence Atwater titled their 1938 book on which the movie is very very loosely based.Its because Jim Carrey as the titular Thomas Popper steals the show from his avian co-stars a flock of CGI penguins who are strenuously adorable in the way that only CGI penguins can be.Carrey who is something of a CGI peacock himself is the best thing about the film which should delight young audiences even as it diverts their adult handlers. The movie is the very dictionary definition of ""cute"" (which as a formal classification places it just above ""not bad"" yet somewhat south of ""hilarious""). The laughs -- many of which have to do with a chronically flatulent penguin named Stinky the production of plentiful amounts of penguin poop and a character named Pippi (Ophelia Lovibond) whose entire dialogue revolves around words beginning with the letter P -- come at frequent and reliable intervals.Carrey is responsible for most of them. But then again hes also something of an acquired taste.Playing a slick Manhattan real estate developer who reluctantly comes into possession of six Gentoo penguins the actor uses his gift for physical comedy and funny voices to propel this gentle comedy forward toward its sweet if slightly familiar message about the importance of family over career advancement.A divorced dad who shares custody of his kids with his ex-wife (Carla Gugino) Popper decides to keep the penguins only after his son (Maxwell Perry Cotton) and daughter (Madeline Carroll) -- whom he has always previously let down -- beg him not to send them back. Grown-ups will see where this is going.But before it gets there what follows is a series of antic misadventures involving penguins need for cold temperatures -- Popper essentially turning his apartment into a giant walk-in freezer -- and the birds propensity for imprinting with a parental figure regardless of species. Brace yourself. During the movies awww-inducing conclusion those of you who are allergic to cuteness -- or to Jim Carrey -- might want to look away.All others especially those who enjoyed the penguin-themed ""Surfs Up"" ""Happy Feet"" or even ""March of the Penguins"" should get a kick out of ""Popper"" if not for the goofball birds themselves then for their even more endearing human counterpart.Contains some rude mostly bathroom-oriented humor and one Viagra joke.

(Barry Wetcher) Elizabeth Weitzman Friday June 17 2011 400 AM Title Mr. Poppers Penguins Family film about a busy New Yorker who inherits several penguins. With Jim Carrey Carla Gugino. Director Mark Waters (137). PG crude humor. At area theaters.Thanks to plucky performances and some perfectly precious pets ""Mr. Poppers Penguins"" provides a pleasant if obviously packaged pursuit.Sorry. Ill try to stop doing that. Though there is something infectious about the old-fashioned innocence of Mark Waters comedy which broadly updates the 1938 novel by Richard and Florence Atwater while retaining its sweet amusements. That a single letter can be used to such silliness is part of the appeal.Both Popper (Jim Carrey ideally cast) and his assistant Pippi (Ophelia Lovibond) prefer to preface their pronouncements with the letter ""p."" And they get plenty of opportunity when he receives an unexpected package six penguins who immediately upend everything.Since the three screenwriters are clearly uncomfortable with original ideas Popper is the classic movie dad a divorced Manhattan workaholic who barely connects with his kids (Madeline Carroll Maxwell Perry Cotton). Slick and successful he spends all his time arranging big-ticket real estate deals.The biggest of all soon beckons Tavern on the Green is for sale and the crotchety owner (Angela Lansbury) is willing to negotiate. But an apartment full of penguins has left Popper distracted and unfocused--or in the eyes of his children and ex-wife (a wasted Carla Gugino) finally human.Suddenly his career is on ice and hes having a blast turning his Upper East Side duplex into a skating rink making nests in his freezer and waiting for eggs to hatch. Is it possible hes getting a second chance at the life he really wants?Lets just say you dont go to a family film like this for surprises. You go because waddling animals are always adorable because Carrey is a comic delight and because thankfully these creatures neither talk nor require 3D glasses to be seen. Sure the story is predictable. And we could definitely have done without the scatological humor (up to and including penguin potty-training). But Waters has a gentle touch and he shuns the cheap cynicism of most formulaic kid flicks. Which are perks positively any parent can appreciate.Stay Awake For As weve all suspected the Guggenheims central spiral makes a great water slide.

""Mr. Poppers Penguins"" is in part a tale of Tavern on the Green. So -- its a dis aster movie? No. Instead the chintz- tastic Central Park tourist magnet helps save the soul of Popper (Jim Carrey) a slick real-estate dealer who because of his careerism is a divorced father of two who barely knows his kids -- theyre being raised by their mom (Carla Gugino). His empty nest is filled with crates sent to him by his explorer father just before his demise making Popper papa to half a dozen penguins. They clash with his immaculate Park Avenue bachelor lair so after considering some penguin recipes he arranges to have them sent to the Central Park Zoo. Thats when his sulky kids show up and decide that the penguins are awesome and maybe Dad isnt so bad either. So he keeps them. The movie is a surprisingly touching low-key ballad of middle-aged male regret disguised as a kiddie comedy replete with poop and fart jokes and soccer balls launched at Poppers crotch. As Popper figures out how to keep the penguins calm (they like Charlie Chaplin movies recognizing a kindred spirit) the story becomes an extended metaphor for how a cool guy gradually learns to give up his groovy titanium solo existence and accept the uncontrollable ooze and whine of family life. Its an avian ""About a Boy"" at 28 degrees Fahrenheit which is the temperature at which Popper keeps his apartment while he brings in snow and goes slightly mad waiting for the penguins eggs to hatch. Meanwhile at the office Popper is scheming to buy Tavern on the Green the trophy deal his bosses want before they will agree to add his name to their partnership. The restaurants owner (Angela Lansbury) refuses to sell though -- she is looking for something besides money. So is his ex whom he starts delicately asking for dates. ""You like Mom"" one of his kids teases him in one of many endearing little ironic moments and when his adolescent daughter lights up while trying on a new dress he says simply ""I made that."" Who has ever expressed parental pride more succinctly? Carrey who was brilliant in last years ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" is an inspired choice to play this role. Though the movie begins like one of those wretched Robin Williams Disney comedies (and is dotted with bits of broken slapstick) it leverages the nastiness that has always underlaid his inexhaustible ingratiation. Carrey isnt just a sultan of smarm when he keeps saying ""Yabsolutely."" There is frosty hostility there that movies like ""The Cable Guy"" never quite managed to wrangle. Carrey is less ideal to do the warm-dad transition that Williams would have handled expertly yet the script (which clankingly shifts gears from writing style to writing style) delivers its best stuff in these scenes not in such frantic moments as when the penguins bust loose and slide down the helix of the Guggenheim during a fancy party. When his ex-wife falls on him while skating at Wollman Rink and asks what happened he says ""I think we just hit a rough patch."" Whenever a corporate big shot accepts a major promotion he never takes the podium to announce that hes looking forward to spending less time with his family. Without being too blunt about it Popper and his penguins waddle into a happy point about work and money versus life and family. As Popper himself notices his and the penguins saga gets so endearing that it could have been narrated by Morgan Freeman. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Rita Wilson named editor of Huff/Post 40 site Read Next Rita Wilson named editor of Huff/Post 40 site Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 38634 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 20496 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 20190 16 feared dead in Texas hot air balloon crash Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

"Mr. Poppers Penguins is amiable family fare - USATODAY.com Skip to Main Content USA TODAY Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather Mr. Poppers Penguins is amiable family fare By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Updated | | Share Reprints amp; Permissions Mr. Poppers Penguins bears almost no resemblance to the classic childrens book of the same name. But thats not necessarily a bad thing. By Barry Wetcher 20th Century Fox via AP Six penguins and a Popper Captain Lovey Bitey Nimrod Stinky and Loudy star with Jim Carrey who inherits them after his dad dies. EnlargeClose By Barry Wetcher 20th Century Fox via AP Six penguins and a Popper Captain Lovey Bitey Nimrod Stinky and Loudy star with Jim Carrey who inherits them after his dad dies. Nothing much happens in Richard and Florence Atwaters quaint 1938 story. Perhaps the most appealing elements of the book are the pen and ink illustrations by Robert Lawson. The visual images in the movie are also the highlight particularly scenes of a procession of penguins parading across a Manhattan street romping around an upscale New York apartment or sliding down the iconic spiral walkways of the Guggenheim. The birds are a deftly rendered blend of the real thing and their computer-generated brethren. While Jim Carrey as Mr. Popper is ostensibly the star hes upstaged by the waddling waterfowl. And he keeps his elastic-faced mugging to a minimum aware that the show is for the birds. The result is an amiable movie thats suitable family fare though it does suffer from an excess of obnoxious bathroom humor provided mostly by a penguin named Stinky. Carrey plays a familiar character a workaholic clueless dad with issues stemming from his own absentee father. He has a young son Billy (Maxwell Perry Cotton) and a teenage daughter Janie (Madeline Carroll) and a hankering for his ex-wife Amanda (Carla Gugino). The movie plays off every divorced childs dream that his parents will someday get back together. But since the entire scenario has an air of fantasy blended with screwball comedy this doesnt seem as problematic as in other more reality-based family films. Director Mark Waters has fared better with edgier humor such as 2003s clever remake of Freaky Friday and his 2004 teen flick Mean Girls. But he keeps the action lively and the camera trained on the adorable flightless birds blending live action and CGI seamlessly. Most of all Carrey hits the right notes dialing it down and letting the penguins take center stage. About the movie Mr. Poppers Penguins  1/2 out of fourStars Jim Carrey Carla Gugino Angela Lansbury Clark Gregg Madeline Carroll Director Mark Waters Distributor 20th Century Fox Rating PG for mild rude humor and some language Running time 1 hour 34 minutes Opens Friday nationwide Popper unlike the books dreamy house painter is a cynical real estate developer. His eye is on a prize Central Parks Tavern on the Green. But owner Mrs. Van Gundy (Angela Lansbury) doesnt want to sell -- especially not to a developer. Meanwhile the Popper kids have grown increasingly distant from their driven dad. But that changes when Mr. Popper receives a surprise wooden crate from Antarctica. It turns out his explorer father died and left Popper six Emperor penguins. Popper whose sterile apartment hardly seems pet-friendly finds that the penguins render him a hit with his kids. The tuxedoed birds are undeniably endearing especially when they gather around Poppers TV mesmerized by Charlie Chaplin who could pass as a distant relative. Soon Popper goes a bit dotty. He converses with the birds braves freezing temps for them and prepares sushi (well raw mackerel) for them. In addition to their penchant for wacky high jinks the penguins teach Popper a thing or two about family. Think Mr. Poppers Proper Priorities. Speaking of things alliterative Mr. Popper has an assistant named Pippi (Ophelia Lovibond) who persists in her peppy preference for the letter p. Its silly stuff but genially funny. The whole movie could be summed up similarly. Mr. Poppers Penguins is predictable but well-intentioned fun. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

"Mr. Poppers Penguins Movie review - LA Times ENTERTAINMENT ENTERTAINMENT Movie Review Mr. Poppers Penguins Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic ""Mr. Poppers Penguins"" a mildly amusing flight of fancy for the family crowd is far better for its penguins than its Popper. Not that Jim Carreys Mr. Popper is poorly done per se. But the penguins are perfectly suited for stealing scenes and hearts as they waddle around and completely take over this farce. There are six of them -- Captain Lovey Bitey Nimrod Stinky and Loudy -- named like Snow Whites dwarfs for their personality quirks. And despite their elegant white tie and tails look they wreak a remarkable amount of smile-inducing havoc anywhere their bright orange webbies take them which is into virtually every corner of Mr. Poppers life. For director Mark Waters who peaked early with ""Mean Girls"" in 2004 and has struggled more than succeeded since ""Mr. Poppers"" represents a modest uptick. Screenwriters Sean Anders and John Morris (the pair behind the underappreciated silly splash of ""Hot Tub Time Machine"") and Jared Stern have taken the bones of the 1938 childrens classic by Richard and Florence Atwater -- man gets penguins life is upended lessons are learned -- and gives the film lots of modern problems maybe one or two too many. Mr. Poppers base of operation shifts from the country to the big city New York. Hes no longer a lowly house painter but a big-shot Manhattan real estate wheeler-dealer. But at its heart Mr. Poppers journey of self-discovery has changed with the movie introducing the notion of and building the film around what it takes to be a good father in these complicated times. The film begins with a quick flashback of young Tommy Popper getting ham radio dispatches from his world-traveling adventurer father (an absentee dad in modern parlance). When next we see him hes grown into a successful exec with a divorce on the books the kids every other weekend and his emotions carefully shelved. Yet in his pristine Manhattan penthouse its clear to see that hes lonely at the top. With the news of his fathers death comes an unexpected legacy a penguin. One penguin soon becomes six (its a shipping issue). Care and feeding proves difficult to say the least. His ""p"" popping alliterating assistant Pippi (Ophelia Lovibond) trails along doing what she can. Harder to handle for this corporate climber is Poppers growing affection for the birds and the way theyre warming up relations with the family. The family is an amiable one with Carla Gugino as the former missus more bemused than bitter. Madeline Carroll (""Swing Vote"") and Maxwell Perry Cotton are the teen and pre-teen offspring Janie and Billy whove been put in charge of general discontent. But you can tell theres a lot of goodwill lingering around the edges since they are charmed by Dads transformation from uptight to slightly crazy as he converts his apartment into a frigid ice and snow playground for his penguin pack. There are a couple of outside pressures that keep the action cooking. Poppers acquisition-hungry bosses want Tavern on the Green and Poppers future is riding on persuading its reluctant society doyenne (Angela Lansbury) to sell. The other is the New York Zoos ""flightless bird specialist"" (Craig Gregg) who in a move reminiscent of ""101 Dalmatians"" is trying to get his hands on the birds for questionable reasons. But the-impossible-to-upstage stars are the penguins a combination of real Gentoos specially trained for the film and some computer-generated counterparts. The special effects gurus blend the two seamlessly making it easy to believe there was no digital wizardry involved which is perhaps the niftiest trick of all. The birds also provide the films slapstick extremes with Carrey setting most of his ""Dumb and Dumber"" aside. Though the biggest action number has the birds crashing a major charity event at the Guggenheim Museum using its grand spiral ramp for a water slide the smaller moments are sometimes more satisfying. Like a ""quiet"" dinner at home table set with Popper unfazed by the penguins fishy mess and atrocious manners. Ironically the eye of the storm is a much-toned-down Carrey. Its almost as if he senses that his outsize comic antics have come to irritate more than amuse audiences in recent years. Yet somehow even with six pairs of happy feet and Carrey keeping his rubber-band lips and googly eyes mostly in check theres a spark missing -- that bit of magic that would have made it possible for ""Mr. Poppers Penguins"" to soar.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Entertainment Mr. Poppers Penguins (movie) Jim Carrey Angela Lansbury Swing Vote (movie) John Morris Movie Review Mr. Poppers Penguins 24 Frames Past Present and Future Movies Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad83deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-mr-poppers-penguins-20110617,0,3974865.story",200,mr.popper'spenguins14,mr.popper'spenguins,latimes

Jim Carrey Carla Gugino et al.? OK technically true at least in terms of humans.But the real stars of this show are six Gentoo penguins who go by the character-appropriate names of Captain Loudy Bitey Stinky Nimrod and Lovey.Be prepared for the oh-so-real possibility that your kid -- or your wife -- is going to want a penguin for Christmas after seeing this movie. A week after seeing it at a preview Im still trying to figure out how a Gentoo would adapt to a Deep Ellum loft and a corgi-schnauzer mix.Based on the 1938 childrens book of the same name by Richard and Florence Atwater Mark Waters film version bears only a teensy resemblance to the original -- as in it has a Mr. Popper and it has penguins. The original book was folksy the movies a bit more sophisticated but it all comes down to one brilliant concept that still works businessman plus penguins plus snazzy apartment turned ice rink.Jim Carrey stars as the charming Tom Popper whose boyhood was spent wondering when his far- and still-wandering adventurer dad would return home. Before Daddy Popper dies in the Antarctic he sends his now-grown boy a special delivery. Tom eyes the first crate suspiciously ""Too big for a snow globe too small for a yurt"" he ponders.The penguin thats lurking inside at first appears to be a statue but it turns out all he (or she) needs is a little thaw time. Another crate soon arrives bearing five waddling little friends. The sextet puts a considerable damper on Poppers day job as a wannabe real-estate tycoon whos doing his best to pry Tavern on the Green out of the faux-trembling hands of sly little-old-lady owner Angela Lansbury.At first Poppers vexed by his new brood but when his kids and ex-wife go all googly-eyed with penguin love his attitude changes. Soon hes shopping the fish market for prime squid allowing the tuxedoed bunch to watch all the TV they want -- theyre fond of Charlie Chaplin -- and fending off suspicious neighbors and an overzealous zookeeper.The movies delights include a glorious scene where the penguins crash a high-society party at the Guggenheim Museum -- imagine what they can do with some water and that big spiral walkway -- and a bit where everyone plays soccer in Central Park. The smaller moments also enchant Carrey teaching a chorus-line of screeching Gentoos to shuffle-ball-change and do jazz hands really cant be topped.All the actors hit just the right sweet spot -- charm and wit with a little edge but never truly mean or snarky not even the nominal bad guy. Carrey is in full-on ultralovable mode; even when hes being a greedy real-estate mogul early in the film you cant help but adore him just a little.Carla Gugino is similarly warm and winning as the ex-wife and Ophelia Lovibond gets in some hilarious moments as Pippa Poppers lisping assistant who is profoundly unable to produce a proper paragraph without a perplexing profusion of P-sounds.20th Century Fox starts the show with a cute short starring that goofy Ice Age squirrel Scrat whose diligent quest for an acorn rearranges the continents.Mr. Poppers PenguinsA- Starring Jim Carrey Carla Gugino Angela Lansbury and Ophelia Loviborn.

Starring Jim Carrey Carla Gugino and Angela Lansbury. Directed by Mark Waters. (PG. 97 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Everything about the idea of ""Mr. Poppers Penguins"" sounds lovely and everything about the actual movie is ugly. Perhaps youre picturing what I pictured the gentle whimsical story of a sweet dreamy fellow and his penguin friends. What you get is something about a creep who becomes inconvenienced by a group of penguins who never stop passing gas defecating and getting into all kinds of computer-enhanced antics. The movie takes the title and little else from the 1938 childrens book by Richard and Florence Atwater. Instead of a house painter Mr. Popper is now a rapacious real estate developer in Manhattan. Instead of being married hes divorced. Instead of having nice kids he has a couple of brats most notably a teenage daughter who hates his guts. And instead of having an aura of peace Mr. Popper is played by Jim Carrey who is as peaceful as a psychotic episode. In addition this Mr. Popper incarnation has father issues. Dad was never around. Yes it was tough. Do you realize that what passes for a childrens movie today would be considered something bordering on tragedy a couple of generations ago? Just a thought. Related Stories Mr. Poppers Penguins Of course some will say ""Hey its just a childrens picture"" But to defend childrens films in this way is to have no respect for them. Here characters behave with little internal consistency. The story - involving believe it or not Mr. Poppers desire to buy out and demolish a famous New York restaurant - is without interest. But worst of all the movie is completely without joy. Youd think the heart of the film would be Mr. Poppers relationship with his penguins. But he has almost no relationship with them and keeps them as a way of getting into his childrens good graces. When he finally does start warming up to them Carrey plays it like something has snapped in his head and hes heading for a breakdown. So first Mr. Popper is a bad guy. Then hes nuts. And theres no love. Likewise the penguins are filmed without affection from human eye level and part of the time theyre clearly not there and Carrey is talking to a blue screen. Still if youre in the market for a movie about a weird nervous unpleasant guy talking to computer-generated penguins this is your ticket. E-mail Mick LaSalle at mlasallesfchronicle.com.

First it was feel-good doctors dispensing amphetamines then feel-good films dispensing formulaic good cheer and surefire happy endings. But a really good film like ""Buck"" a documentary by Cindy Meehl does much more than serve as a drug substitute. It keeps you fascinated even enthralled; elicits astonishment even wonderment and makes you grateful for the chance to meet someone remarkable. Watch a scene from the film ""Buck."" Video courtesy of Sundance Selects. At first glance Buck Brannaman seems less remarkable than abundantly likable. A middle-age cowboy who travels around the country giving four-day horse-training clinics he is eloquent in a laconic Western way and likes to downplay the potential uplift of the clinic experience. ""A lot of people"" he says wryly ""they want it to be fuzzy and warm and cosmic."" Fuzzy it is not and warmth doesnt play as much of a role as wisdom and control (of ones self and the horse in that order). Yet you could make a case for cosmic once youve seen Buck in action--teaching horses the way of the world without breaking their spirit and riding them like a centaur out of Greek myth. ""You look like one mind and one body"" he says while demonstrating it. ""If you get a taste of it a taste of what Im talking about you couldnt get enough of it."" ENLARGE Horse trainer Buck Brannaman in Cindy Meehls documentary about him Buck. Sundance Selects If training horses were all there was to Mr. Brannamans story the encounter would still be worthwhile. Hes the closest thing imaginable to that staple of modern myth the horse whisperer. Robert Redford hired him as an advisor when ""The Horse Whisperer"" was going into production and as the movies director and star recalls in Ms. Meehls documentary ended up modeling much of his character on Bucks gentleness and humanity. Mr. Brannamans techniques stress kindness (how you treat a horse reflects how you treat your family and other people in your life) combined with firmness. (Like Cesar Millan TVs ""Dog Whisperer"" he teaches humans how to be an animals parent not its friend.) Ms. Meehls own techniques include astute showmanship and in one instance a shocking illustration that some horses remain immune to humane ministrations. What makes ""Buck"" the movie so uncommonly affecting is the tormented past of Buck the man. As little boys he and his brother performed blindfold rope tricks in a theatrical act created by their brutish father. Buck was beaten regularly and unmercifully as a boy broken in ways no one would wish on any animal. How he survived is a mystery how he was rescued is a marvel and how he used his torment to transform himself is an inspiration. He didnt find his vocation in a flash. At first he says ""I was just looking for a peaceful place to be where I wasnt threatened."" When you watch him now though giving horses the love he never got you know in the deepest sense where hes coming from. Green Lantern A dud that gives green a bad name ""Green Lantern"" starts with a contest between a drone guided by an artificial-intelligence program and a jet fighter controlled by Hal Jordan a test pilot who appears to have the wrong stuff. Hes played with unassuming--and mercifully self-deprecating--good humor by Ryan Reynolds. Thats fine so long as Hal is struggling with the turgid Oedipal issues that cause a temporary flame-out in his psyche. Once he becomes Green Lantern however unassuming doesnt cut it. The movie needs an assuming hero. It also needs a heroine with something more to do than act tentatively (Blake Lively wins this years Kristin Stewart Award for Indistinct Diction) and a plot generated by something smarter than the artifice program that guides it. Watch a scene from the film ""Green Lantern."" Video courtesy of Warner Bros. ""Green Lantern"" was meant to be a sci-fi adventure but it proves to be a genuine mystery. How could its megamoola budget have yielded a production that looks almost as tacky as ""Flash Gordon"" (which had the good grace to deprecate itself at every turn)? How could Martin Campbell the director who gave us such stylish delights as ""The Mask of Zorro"" and the BBC miniseries ""Edge of Darkness"" have committed so much clumsiness? Why does the storyline function as a handbook for aspiring Green Lanterns (theyre the elite guardians of the universe) and a set-up for a sequel but not as a coherent adventure with appealing characters? (Who cares about all these dim Lanterns and the blobby monster threatening universal nastiness?) I should note that I chose to watch ""Green Lantern"" in 2-D Its third dimension was added in postproduction and Im tired of writing ritual complaints about 3-D. Maybe I made the wrong call and watching this film through plastic glasses would have been a life-changing experience. Still the only character I cared about even slightly was the villainous Hector Hammond played by Peter Sarsgaard. When I say played I mean performed from deep inside latex makeup that gives Hector a dome larger than Peter Boyles in ""Young Frankenstein"" plus the general demeanor of a psychopath sucking on persimmons. Yet Mr. Sarsgaard succeeds in creating a real guy with real passions. Apart from him theres nada. City of Life and Death ENLARGE Gao Yuanyuan as Miss Jiang in City of Life and Death. Kino Intl. A drama that could pass for a documentary ""City of Life and Death"" re-creates the Nanjing Massacre when invading soldiers of the Japanese Imperial Army slaughtered some 300000 citizens of what had been one of Chinas ancient capitals. Lu Chuans epic film is harrowing in the extreme. Every atrocity or so it would seem every unspeakable moment of bestiality has been culled from historical documents and woven into a narrative that begins with picture postcards of the period and ends with ritual dancing and drumming that could pass for a Japanese version of the Nazi rallies seen in Leni Riefenstahls films. The initial effect is both distanced and distancing a remarkable simulation--with stunning black-and-white cinematography by Cao Yu--that chronicles the horrors without pausing to concentrate on individual victims or individual predators. Forces gather sirens shriek tank engines roar troops march. (Lai Qizhens sound design contributes strongly to the illusion of being in the midst of it all.) Little by little though the friezes of mortal anguish that resemble collectivist art--or the photo chronicles of Nazi concentration camps--give way to such vivid individual portraits as a Nazi proconsul aghast at the slaughter his unprincipled Chinese secretary a sensitive Japanese soldier and a prostitute who touches his soul without trying to. This is hardly a film to recommend as entertainment. As an act of remembrance though it is singular and in its way soaring. Mr. Poppers Penguins At one would-be poignant point in the proceedings--Mr. Poppers perky secretary Pippi uses p-words so persistently that its catching--a family of penguins that has attached itself to Jim Carreys title character must choose between fish or love. The fish are being proffered--oops offered--by a cold-hearted functionary of the New York Zoo while the love emanates from yes you guessed it. Unloved as a child Mr. P. has had to learn how to love others. Watch a scene from the film ""Mr. Poppers Penguins."" Video courtesy of 20th Century Fox. A cold-hearted observer might bet on the birdies opting for the food but it isnt that kind of movie. Given what it is--a family comedy for very young audiences--the fish fall short love conquers all and the cuteness of the penguins carries the day. My heart was warmed by gratuitous moments when Mr. Carrey clowns for clownings sake--in the best of them he makes a slo-mo entrance to a press conference even though the camera is running at normal speed. Flightless birds sporting tuxedos are fine in their place--ideally Antarctica--but the films portrait of trans-species passion did not prompt me to probe the possibility of purchasing a penguin through Petco. DVD FOCUS ENLARGE The Black Stallion (1979) Please forgive me for--or indulge me in--my love of this film which Ive recommended before and have written about on many other occasions. Recommending DVDs is an association game and the words horse trainer let alone horse whisperer point inexorably to Carroll Ballards sublime (and wordless) vision of a boy and a wild Arabian horse bonding on a tropical island. Kelly Reno is the boy and Mickey Rooney is the trainer. Mr. Ballard directed from an adaptation of the Walter Farley novel by Melissa Mathison Jeanne Rosenberg and William D. Wittliff. Caleb Deschanel did the peerless cinematography. Raise the Red Lantern (1991) ENLARGE Not sci-fi although Zhang Yimous masterful drama is set in a China of the early 20th century that might well have been part of another galaxy. Gong Li is 19-year-old Songlian a university student of unworldly beauty. Forced to quit school after the death of her father she marries a much older man of means becomes his fourth concubine and is forced to compete ruthlessly with women higher in his hierarchy. If ever a film cried out for Blu-ray release this is the one but its available only on a conventional--and mediocre--DVD. The Truman Show (1998) ENLARGE Jim Carrey is Truman Burbank a man who doesnt know hes the star of a TV show about his own life. Peter Weir directed Andrew Niccols funny and seductive fable about how TV has invaded our lives and hijacked our heads. The film requires frequent suspension of disbelief as questions of logic multiply. Yet its strengths are more dramatic and emotional than topical or logical. Truman Burbank is a touchingly gallant creation an unwitting Odysseus on an odyssey he cant fathom. The cast includes Ed Harris and Laura Linney. The cinematographer was Peter Biziou. --Joe Morgenstern Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + In ""Mr. Poppers Penguins Jim Carrey gives a brave naked and quite possibly insane performance as a down-and-out male nymphomaniac who misplaces his pre-coital stimulant. Oh pardon me. Thats ""Mr. Penguins Poppers and it doesnt appear to exist. Oh well. ""Mr. Poppers Penguins is certainly real even though everything about it is synthetic except for the occasions in which Carrey can rouse himself from the somnolence of family-movie slop.Hes drifted into the corporate-dad mode thats ensnared Fred MacMurray Robin Williams Eddie Murphy and Nicolas Cage and requires a star to mug or mope or go manic to play a guy who risks his job in order to make amends with his kids then risks the kids to make amends with the job. Theres an ex-wife to re-woo a big client to impress and much nonsense to explain to the family and the boss (though never to us since the nonsense is why weve come in the first place).At the risk of stating the obvious the subject this time is penguins. Tom Popper the high-powered real estate developer Carreys playing gets a refrigerated box at the door of his Roche Bobois-furnished Manhattan penthouse. Then another arrives. Before long he has six waddling roommates (Loudy and Bitey and Nimrod etc.) and a neighbor threatening to call the condo board.This is a flavorless adaptation of Richard and Florence Atwaters 73-year-old childrens book about a poor family who to make some money and keep their home builds a circus around their new pets. The movie builds side plots around Toms longing for his absent explorer father (the penguins are dads parting gift) and a grand dames plans to unload the recently shuttered Central Park restaurant Tavern on the Green possibly to the greedy developers Tom works for. I guess ""Mr. Trumps Penguins was a bridge too far.Jim Carrey has entered that ""isnt everything adorable phase of his career. He shares this new movie with children animals (natural and not-so) and old people. Philip Baker Hall William Charles Mitchell and Dominic Chianese play the partners at his firm; Angela Lansbury plays the grand dame. He even donates a bunch of scenes to the cute Ophelia Lovibond who plays Toms alliterative assistant. Its all a shameless bid for a more innocent audience. But its when the devilish old Carrey materializes that the movie -- which Mark Waters directed and is credited to three screenwriters -- dares to be more than a greeting card. He squawks and mugs and flails. He mocks the bosses he hopes will make him partner. Hes reckless and bad. The devil is fun.Maybe without quite realizing it Carrey is embroiled in a kind of Jekyll-and-Hyde drama. He wants to color within the lines of a complete character but still needs to feel the snap of breaking a role without being sent to the outtake reel. Here when Carrey elongates his already gaunt face wears a wool overcoat and slicks back his hair (you know hes snapped when the gel holding it in place wears off) he looks well on his way to being able to play a youngish Montgomery Burns in a live-action ""Simpsons movie. But ""Mr. Popper backs Mr. Hyde into schmaltz.Some men would have handed half a dozen gentoo penguins to the overeager needlessly shady zookeeper (Clark Gregg) pestering Tom. Or they would have phoned up an adventurous particularly unscrupulous star chef. Tom holds onto them because they make his whiny son and moody daughter happier to spend the night. Its hard to tell nowadays whether wed be more shocked by penguin tenderloin or irreversible divorce.For us its not much of a contest. Carla Gugino plays the former Mrs. Popper and she doesnt make calamitous belly-slides down the spirals of the Guggenheim Museum or defecate into a toilet on command. She just looks at everything with love drops off the children and lets Carrey win her back. By the end of this movie if there were any fairness in the world shed be the one released back into the wild -- not the penguins.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com or followed on Twitter wesley_morris.

More by Steven Rea Introducing Phillys Maris Curran director of Five Nights in Maine Jul 29 Weekend Movie Selections Jul 30 Bad Moms Mila Kunis and writers from The Hangover skewer the mommy wars raunchily Jul 29 Jim Carrey has worked with animals before - after all he was Ace Ventura pet detective right? (And Jeff Daniels his costar in Dumb and Dumber wasnt really human was he?) So the sight of the actor mugging it up with a half-dozen penguins isnt all that strange. More about Mr. Poppers Penguins >> Its not all that amusing either. In Mr. Poppers Penguins a slick soulless adaptation of the childrens book classic Carrey is a Type-A New Yorker whose life gets upended his icy heart thawed by the mysterious arrival of a crate of gentoos from Antarctica. Tom Popper as we learn from the flashbacking prologue was a kid who saw his father only once every few years - the peripatetic pop communicated with his son by shortwave radio. Now an adult (kind of) and a real estate exec jockeying for a partnership Popper has just closed on Manhattans famous Flatiron building. His troika of bosses tell him that if he can nab Central Parks Tavern on the Green - they plan to tear down the landmark eatery and erect a skyscraper - theyll add his name to the companys marble slab. Carreys Popper has two kids (Madeline Carroll Maxwell Perry Cotton) and an ex-wife (Carla Gugino) all of whom have pretty much given up on him. Hes so wrapped up in his work so obsessed with the next deal that their lives are afterthoughts. Enter the penguins. Let the putative comic mayhem the potty-training jokes and life-lessons begin. Apparently real penguins were used in Mr. Poppers Penguins and while they have names - Nimrod Captain Bitey Loudy Stinky and Lovey - good luck trying to distinguish one from the other or feeling even the slightest twinge of emotional connection to these waddling birds. But Carrey to earn his paycheck has to act like hes bonding with this squawking colony. Popper makes over his Park Avenue apartment to accommodate his feathered friends and when his two kids see the birds suddenly theyre thinking maybe their dad isnt so bad after all. But then theres the heavy - a Central Park Zoo official (Clark Gregg Agent Coulson in Iron Man and Thor) who wants the penguins. And theres Angela Lansbury as Tavern on the Greens grand old dame. And theres Ophelia Lovibond an English actress who plays Poppers personal assistant and has the unenviable job of blurting out endless streams of alliterative sentences heavy on the letter P. Her name is Pippi. Mr. Poppers Penguins proceeds apace (this P-word stuff is infectious) and its all over before you know it and the company that keeps track of media impressions for Donald Trump should stay alert There are several pointless mentions of ""the Donald.""

Comments click to enlarge Mr. Poppers Penguins Rated PG  95 minutes  2011 The beloved 1938 childrens book about a house painter who becomes guardian to a dozen penguins has been turned into a standard-issue childrens comedy with Jim Carrey. By ""standard-issue"" I mean that theres a neglectful-dad story line (now Popper is a divorced real estate agent in Manhattan who cant connect with his preteen daughter) and numerous poop and fart jokes (the penguins have this covered). As a child I was captivated by the idea of a fellow flooding and freezing his basement to create a winter wonderland for his frolicking seabirds; director Mark Waters (Ghosts of Girlfriends Past) re-creates the scene in Carreys high-rise apartment but it was a lot better in my imagination.

"Mr. Poppers Penguins review - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Posher Penguins still pleasantJim Carrey dials it down to stand out amid birds kids -- 2.5 starsJune 16 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticJim Carrey in ""Mr. Poppers Penguins.""For some reason I was under the impression Jim Carrey already made his penguin movie. Doesnt it seem like it? Am I the only one who had to ask himself that question coming out of ""Mr. Poppers Penguins""? Turns out this is his first and its not bad (optional """" goes here). Director Mark Waters film stars Carrey some real penguins and some computer-generated penguins. Together they deliver the expected albeit with a lighter touch and a nicer sheen (thanks to cinematographer Florian Ballhaus) than most of producer John Davis previous family-friendly commodities. That list includes ""Garfield"" ""Daddy Day Care"" and ""Dr. Dolittle"" plus sequels. With some sentences listing the titles is enough. Given the story changes its a miracle ""Mr. Poppers Penguins"" works at all. In the Depression-shadowed 1938 book by Richard and Florence Atwater Popper barely gets by as a house painter. Such a scenario would never get by the average early 21st century Hollywood studio development desk. So Popper has been transformed into the latest in a long line of sarcastic materialistic jerks showcased by PG-rated comedies. This hollow man waiting to be filled exists outside current economic conditions and must learn through comedy and a little heartbreak that money isnt everything. Kids come first. Before penguins even. Charged by his business partners to secure the ownership of Tavern on the Green in Central Park Popper a cagey Park Avenue manipulator and divorced father of two looks on his every-other-weekend custody arrangement as a low-level hassle at best. His ex (Carla Gugino whose very casting suggests the hero was a fool to let her character go) has moved on to a new relationship. Popper meantime whose own explorer father wasnt around much receives a crated gift from his dad after he passes. Inside the crate is a penguin. Later more penguins arrive and suddenly Poppers 3200-square-foot Manhattan town house (the script goes out of its way to specify the square footage) becomes an attractively chaotic and lived-in destination for Poppers kids. Others of course do not like this development including a zealous zoo official (""flightless bird division"") played by Clark Gregg. He is quite deft in his finessing of a routine foil. Hes not alone; the impressive supporting cast also features Angela Lansbury as the Tavern on the Green owner skeptical of Poppers character. As Poppers madly alliterative assistant Pippi (""Mr. Popper were pulling up presently"") Ophelia Lovibond works near-wonders with a one-track joke. Director Waters did the ""Freaky Friday"" remake as well as ""Mean Girls"" and knows enough not to turn a slapstick melee into a headache. A scene set at a Guggenheim museum gala disrupted by penguins manages some nicely staged physical comedy. (Waters has an instinct for when to keep the camera at a respectful middle distance from a pratfall which tends to make pratfalls funnier.) Its Carreys show primarily. He favors restraint when he can get away with it here. Now and then he does some actual interacting with his fellow actors among them the excellent Madeline Carroll as daughter Janie. While parents (well this parent) mightve done without the references to Viagra and ""The Hurt Locker"" nothing in the business models as established and followed profitably by producer Davis would suggest that charm and a fidelity to the spirit of a beloved book has anything to do with making a buck. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating PG (for mild rude humor and some language) Cast Jim Carrey (Mr. Popper); Carla Gugino (Amanda); Angela Lansbury (Mrs. Van Gundy); Ophelia Lovibond (Pippi); Clark Gregg (Nat Jones); Madeline Carroll (Janie); Maxwell Perry Cotton (Billy) Credits Directed by Mark Waters; written by Sean Anders John Morris and Jared Stern; based on the novel by Richard and Florence Atwater; produced by John Davis.

Barry Wetcher In this publicity image released by 20th Century Fox Jim Carrey is shown in a scene from ""Mr. Poppers Penguins."" (AP Photo/20th Century Fox Barry Wetcher) Barry Wetcher In this publicity image released by 20th Century Fox Jim Carrey is shown in a scene from ""Mr. Poppers Penguins."" (AP Photo/20th Century Fox Barry Wetcher) Officially ""Mr. Poppers Penguins"" is based on a childrens book from 1938 but its really based on movies circa 1998 when comedians such as Adam Sandler Eddie Murphy Robin Williams and Jim Carrey were testing the limits of our tolerance. A staple of late-century comedies was the corporate hotshot who is forced by a gypsys curse or a distant relatives inheritance to humble himself.The moral lesson that this movie feeds us smells fishy -- because its not in the book. But the backbone story about a guy who inherits some penguins is enough to tickle the kids.In the book Mr. Popper is a happily married house painter who dreams of faraway adventures. Here Popper (Carrey) is a divorced Manhattan real estate developer who dreams of becoming a partner in his firm. But just as this shark is circling a juicy takeover target -- the historic restaurant Tavern on the Green owned by stubborn Mrs. Van Gundy (Angela Lansbury) -- Popper receives an unwanted inheritance. His adventurer dad has bequeathed him a flock of rare gentoo penguins. Before Popper can respond to an offer from a suspiciously pushy zookeeper (Clark Gregg) Poppers estranged son and daughter discover and bond with the six birds (which get names like Stinky Loudy and Bitey that clue you to the age level of the humor). Soon Poppers cool apartment is turned into a cold Antarctic refuge.Poppers work suffers but his ex-wife (Carla Gugino) sees a new nurturing side of him. Yet as played by Carrey with only mild restraint Popper starts out as a presumably likable goofball so he doesnt have much room to grow and theres little humor generated by the conflict between his job and extended family. This slick flick is all about the penguins which coo and poop like newborn babies and slip and slide like little Charlie Chaplins. Director Mark Waters (""Mean Girls"") neatly integrates trained birds and computer-generated imagery but the warm-blooded actors are stuck with a story that refuses to fly.

Feeling like a desperate bid to revive that old ""Ace Ventura"" magic with Jim Carrey bringing a sextet of penguins into his tony Manhattan apartment ""Mr. Poppers Penguins"" is actually rooted in the old Disney live-action comedy tradition with its colorful stars ridiculous situations and theme of family unity. Carreys headlong dive back into the family-movie pool will make a bit of a splash with its target tyke audience but this Fox release wont be popping up on his career-highlights reel. While husband-and-wife co-authors Richard and Florence Atwater set their quaint 30s-era childrens novel in the small American town of Stillwater the film unfolds in the slicker fancier climes of present-day Manhattan where hotshot commercial real-estate agent Tom Popper (Carrey) lives in a hyper-mod condo alienated from his ex-wife Amanda (Carla Gugino) and possibly even more so from his teenage daughter Janie (Madeline Carroll) and younger son Billy (Maxwell Perry Cotton). Carrey at first makes Popper come across as a shark whose No. 1 goal is to enter the tight circle of his firms partners (Philip Baker Hall Dominic Chianese William C. Mitchell). Laid out in a brief prelude Poppers childhood was marked by a distant relationship with his adventurer dad forever absent on treks and keeping in touch with his son via short-wave radio chats. Now news of his fathers death hardly fazes Popper who hasnt seen him in years. But when Dad gifts son with two crates containing Antarctic penguins on ice Poppers life is turned upside down. Under the workmanlike direction of Mark Waters (""Freaky Friday"" ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"") the movie centers around the fundamental gimmick of pitting Carrey and his trademark physical comedy against a group of scurrying and noisy penguins (lensed with a combination of live-action shots and well-rendered CGI animation) which seem to take to Poppers pad like fish to water even settling down in a cozy corner of his freezer. Preposterous of course and the movie habitually reminds the viewer theres no way Poppers neighbors cant be noticing the sudden chaos that has descended on their exclusive uptown co-op -- though nothing is ever done about it even when Popper turns his place into a penguin-friendly snow field and ice rink. Key to the comedy is Poppers parental guilt Aware that his work has kept him too much away from his kids he realizes Janie and Billy love the little grounded birds at first sight and in fact demand them as pets. Whats a dad to do but to nurture the critters even though the ""penguin expert"" at the New York Zoo (Clark Gregg) wants them for his own sinister supposedly zoological needs? In a mechanical screenplay by several hands (Sean Anders John Morris Jared Stern) Poppers parental project goes predictably out of control. This is perhaps most cleverly expressed during a fundraising party at the Guggenheim where Popper tries to convince Mrs. Van Gundy (Angela Lansbury) the crusty imperious owner of Central Parks legendary Tavern on the Green to sell the property to his firm. With a little ice and water plus the Guggenheims famed sloped ramp the penguins slip and slide and cause all sorts of problems. The script however rams its points and intentions across no matter how little sense they make perhaps cynically assuming most kids wont notice the jarring narrative bumps. Following his terrific performance in the R-rated ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" Carrey has turned to a soft PG vehicle and shows too much strain to make the comedy viable. Occasional asides from the gifted comic such as when he nails an impersonation of Jimmy Stewart or a slo-mo run in real time come off as distractions rather than magic moments. Unlike Gugino (in a vanilla role) and Ophelia Lovibond (in an annoying one) Gregg and Lansbury (now in her eighth decade onscreen in a substantial role in which she dominates her scenes) pleasurably give Carrey something to play against. Both actors portray hard-hearted New York operators offering a counterpoint to the movies endless visual love notes to the Big Apple With Florian Ballhaus shiny cinematography and Stuart Wurtzels upscale production design the city is presented as a glorious winter wonderland. Composer Rolfe Kent accents his usual dark-tinged tropes with variations on Gershwin which is almost as nice as the pics sweet tributes to Chaplin.

TWITTER The six penguins cast in this amiable Fox family comedy steal the movie a along with any fish they can find a although the filmas star Jim Carrey does manage very nicely to hold his own. If Disneys 101 Dalmatians gets blamed for many youngsters pleading for parents to get them what many dog experts consider a very demanding pet then Fox will now have to shoulder its responsibility for children begging for pet penguins. For most youngsters who see the studios Mr. Poppers Penguins will certainly want to have one of these mischievous birds. The six penguins cast in this amiable family comedy steal the movie -- along with any fish they can find -- although the films star Jim Carrey does manage to hold his own. Barely. The only question is How many youngsters are we talking about? With Disneys Cars 2 a week away the film has just days to draw in family audiences and test how much of an impact Carrey still has at the box office. Fox can expect a middling performance although you cant discount the allure of penguins following March of the Penguins and Happy Feet. For the record these are not the Emperor penguins from those films but rather Gentoo penguins. Make that highly trained Gentoo penguins that force their human co-stars to work on 40-degree sets and need constant fish to perform. The film from director Mark Waters (Mean Girls Freaky Friday) encourages viewers to think of the tuxedo birds as silent-movie comics. They constantly watch Charlie Chaplin movies on TV then imitate his acrobatic pratfalls and slapstick as they bounce around Carreys lavish Park Avenue apartment. There are certain stunts of course even a Gentoo cant reliably perform so CG birds are substituted seamlessly and frequently into the action. Sean Anders amp; John Morris and Jared Stern developed the screenplay from a 1938 novel by the husband and wife team of Richard and Florence Atwater. Much has been changed in this update including the need for the penguins to redeem the films hero. Trouble is Tom Popper isnt really a bad dude. Sure hes divorced but rather amicably from Amanda (Carla Gugino) and hes a decent caring father. Oh sure he doesnt completely understand daughter Janies (Madeline Carroll) continual boyfriend problems but then again when she launches into the latest b.f. crisis no one does. Certainly her younger brother Billy (Maxwell Perry Cotton) thinks dad is swell. He does work for an aggressive Manhattan real estate firm but these are hardly capitalist monsters. The owners just want to buy the venerable Tavern on the Green in Central Park to tear it down to build God-only-knows-what. This is a subplot that is hardly worth the bother other than to bring in the equally venerable Angela Lansbury into the film as the restaurants owner. The penguins enter Mr. Poppers life as a final gift from his peripatetic father a rolling stone that visited every corner of the globe except his own home. The father means to reinforce the importance of family on his son -- an idea he evidently embraced very late in life -- through these loving and loyal birds. Certainly his own children better appreciate dad now that joint-custody visits entail romping with these comical birds albeit in an apartment kept near freezing and full of dead fish. So the movie clears a lot of space for the birds to caper all over the 3200-square-foot apartment and around Manhattan when they go out. This includes water sliding down the famous spiraling ramp of the Guggenheim Museum. (No doubt this was mostly if not entirely accomplished with CG birds.) The weakness throughout is a story where subplots never really add up to much. These include the mercenary apartment building receptionist (Desmin Borges) a nosy neighbor (David Krumholtz) a mildly villainous zoo keeper (Clark Gregg) and Poppers perky assistant Pippi (Ophelia Lovibond) who speaks alliterately with a fondness for the letter ""p"" a peculiar and perturbing penchant that provokes audience exasperation pretty quickly. The movie even strands Lansbury with an inconsequential role of a rich snob who declares the 1992 Krug Champagne a ""ghastly vintage"" when in fact its a spectacular one. Credit Carrey for finding funny and silly ways to clown around with his avian co-stars. Thankfully he doesnt revert to the Ace Ventura of his younger years. His are an older mans skillful muggings and slapstick using word deployments -- ""Yabsolutely"" he always answers in the affirmative -- and a lanky body to tweak the comedy. Hes still fun to watch and has gotten over his need to push for jokes and gags where none exists. Waters keeps things moving briskly through the slumps in the script to get back to penguin antics a swiftly as possible. Production values are glossy as the film delivers a fairy-tale New York where penguins can romp without anyone thinking this is in any way odd. Well other than those big-buck donors at the Guggenheim charity reception.

Mr. Poppers Penguins Fair Director Mark Waters. Cast Jim Carrey Carla Gugino Angela Lansbury. Rating PG for mild rude humor and some language. This weeks new movie releases Spotlight Jim Carrey Films with animal stars The now-shameless Carrey mugging for an hour and a half with flightless birds - there is a metaphor there somewhere - must be a huge disaster right? No actually. Not really. Interview Even Jim Carreys camp questioned Mr. Poppers pick ""Mr. Poppers Penguins"" based loosely on the 1938 childrens book certainly contains some trademark Carrey shtick which grew old somewhere around the time of ""Ace Ventura Pet Detective."" That was 17 years ago if youre counting. And while Carrey has flirted with more-legitimate projects here and there such as ""The Truman Show"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" hes also been happy to coast by on films like ""Liar Liar"" and ""Yes Man."" But here he seems to be actually trying. Granted its kind of a dumb story its short on character development and its unusually long on penguin-poop jokes. But director Mark Waters manages to wring some charm out of the film and out of Carrey. Tom Popper (Carrey) grew up mostly communicating with his world-traveler father by short-wave radio as a rather sweet opening scene establishes. Now Popper is a predatory real-estate developer who has neglected his own wife and children to the point that hes lost them. Divorced he sees his son Billy (Maxwell Perry Cotton) and daughter Janie (Madeline Carroll) every other weekend when he picks them up from his ex-wife Amanda (Carla Gugino) but they never really connect. Popper learns one day that his father has died and left him something. Soon a penguin arrives at his swank New York apartment and then five more - this just as he is trying to close a deal to buy Tavern on the Green from Mrs. Van Gundy (Angela Lansbury) an elderly lady who finds value in more than money a foreign concept to Popper. But his visiting kids love the birds and he loves to see his kids happy so soon hes leaving his doors and windows open so that the cold air will keep the penguins happy. This is going to sound ridiculous so lets just work through it The penguins help Popper get closer to his kids and his ex-wife and if you think caring for them helps him learn that there is more to life than turning a profit well wouldnt Mrs. Van Gundy be pleased? Really theres not a surprise in the whole movie except Carrey not quickly wearing out his welcome. Come to think of it thats a pretty big surprise indeed.

Yet recently it feels as if the karmic entertainment forces have been stretching him back to earlier days. His 2008 hit Yes Man had a warmed-over 90s quality (it was Liar Liar with a self-help twist) and though he gave an audacious performance as a gonzo gay con artist in the ersatz?Coen brothers indie I Love You Phillip Morris the film went nowhere. Now heres Carrey in Mr. Poppers Penguins all cartoon quips and geeky overbite grins doing one for the kids. At first the movie looks like a standard Hollywood attempt to take a beloved childrens book -- ?in this case Richard and Florence Atwaters perennial grade-school charmer published in 1938 about a housepainter and his menagerie of penguins -- and gloss it up into a too-brightly-lit slapstick vulgarity. Carrey plays Mr. Popper now a New York real estate shark with a sleek slate-gray apartment an estranged wife (Carla Gugino) and two kids. Hes also got daddy issues (his father a globe-trotting explorer never had time for him apart from their ham-radio chats). Just before Dad expires he sends Popper a present a live penguin who waddles out of a freezer crate. Shes followed days later by another crate with five more penguins. Then they breed. Its just the intrusion of disorder that a control freak like Popper needs. Carrey eyes jutting open in mischief cant really surprise us much anymore. Hes become a domesticated anarchist and here hes in his benignly wacked Bruce Almighty mode. His face is a bit more creased now but those Silly Putty features are as wide-awake as ever and he brings the movie something beyond his familiar nerve-jangled comic spirit He infuses it with conviction and a hidden sweet spot of warmth. The penguin-poop jokes are as inevitable as they are stupid-funny. With say Eddie Murphy as the star Mr. Poppers Penguins might have been a glorified paycheck contrivance. But Carrey is so naturally stylized that he coaxes the films gentle creature-feature insanity to life. He relates to those penguins and so we start to plug in to the antic fun hes having. (Mr. Popper ""Lets kill two birds with one stone."" Penguin ""Honk"" Popper ""Its a metaphor"") As the animals win Popper over he begins to lose his business bearings and the result is a movie of infectious high-concept chaos. It helps that the director Mark Waters (Mean Girls) withstood the temptation to make the elegant dot-eyed emperor penguins too cutely anthropomorphic. Yes they do sit around and watch Charlie Chaplin films on television but mostly they simply charm us with their all-dressed-up stately absurdity. They pop up at the Guggenheim Museum where they disrupt a benefit by sliding around that endless curlicue corridor. If you can resist a scene like that one (I cant) then by all means skip Mr. Poppers Penguins. If on the other hand you can watch Poppers most trusted penguin finally get to fly and feel like youre soaring right up there with her then you may just let this likable trifle whisk you back to childhood.

Mr. Poppers Penguins finds Jim Carrey choosing option number three for his latest misbegotten bid to rediscover his king-of-the-box-office mojo a film that pairs the rubber-faced actor with a gaggle of penguins so cutely anthropomorphized that theyd make his iconic pet detective Ace Ventura giggle with glee.Headlining such conventional dreck is a fall from grace of a familiar sort. And yet that makes it no less embarrassing to behold this disreputable slide into pratfalling with cuddly CG creatures as Mr. Poppers Penguins fervently panders to an under-10 audience with Carreys main requirement only to mug in a variety of reaction shots to his beaked sidekicks mischievous hijinks and--more crucially still--to provide name-brand legitimacy to a dim and unfunny project.Loosely based on Richard and Florence Atwaters childrens novel Mark Waterss film centers on Mr. Popper (Carrey) a Manhattan real estate shark who treats his own offspring with the same career-over-brood detachment that his own globe-trotting father did to him. Bequeathed a live penguin by his deceased dad and shortly thereafter receiving five more Popper initially bristles but when his featureless son Billy (Maxwell Perry Cotton) and boy-trouble-plagued daughter Janie (Madeline Carroll) warm to the tuxedoed creatures he embraces them as a way to mend fences with his progeny--and wouldnt you know they also help him reconnect with his ex-wife (Carla Gugino) and thaw his frozen heart This process involves being kicked in both the crotch and the head with a soccer ball as well as having a penguin poop white-liquid nastiness in his face. The sole saving grace to the ensuing slapsticky action is that after discovering how to manually control the animals defecation Popper doesnt use the birds squirting skills as a weapon against the villainous zookeeper (Clark Gregg) who wants to confiscate them.The saddest thing about Popper is that aside from a Jimmy Stewart impersonation and a pretending-to-be-in-slow-motion gag it exploits so little of Carreys trademark uninhibited zaniness. The movie could have been headlined by anyone; Tim Allen would have been perfect. Waterss bland aesthetics do nothing to elevate Carreys hammy performance which is neutered by a formula that has him first infuriated by the penguins--which are given names like ""Stinky"" and ""Nimrod"" and behave like children who understand English--and then maudlin and heroic when one of their eggs wont hatch and he learns whats really important.Seemingly driven by a lucrative tax-credit production deal Popper goes overboard advertising New York City pivoting its plot around jaunts to Central Park and the Guggenheim references to the Yankees and the Giants and Poppers attempts to purchase Tavern on the Green from an owner (a wasted Angela Lansbury) who prizes noble character over greed. Illogicality is a guiding principle throughout including with regards to why this winter-set heart-warmer is receiving a June theatrical release. Yet truly fatal is the air of desperation clinging to the storys every element from Popper repeatedly using his septuagenarian boss (Philip Baker Hall) as a punching bag for ""Youre old"" jokes to a dance routine with his avian sextet to his British assistant Pippy (Ophelia Lovibond) speaking only in P-word alliterative sentences. In fact the only faint upside to this excruciating dud is that in its movie clips of Charlie Chaplin--who the mesmerized birds view as a kindred waddling spirit--the film might hopefully function for some kids as a gateway to superior comedy cinema.
