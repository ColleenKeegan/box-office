In November Kermit Miss Piggy and their fuzzy menagerie of felt-covered friends will return to the silver screen after a decade in the pop culture wilderness thanks to Forgetting Sarah Marshall star (and longtime Jim Henson fanatic) Jason Segel. Will a new generation of tech-savvy tykes weaned on Buzz Lightyear and Shrek follow them? Well if Segels able to tap into what made The Muppets Take Manhattan (1984 G 1 hr. 34 mins.) so magical and avoid what made Muppets From Space (1999 G 1 hr. 28 mins.) so dreadful theres no reason Fozzie Bear cant return to the A list. I single out these two films because both are now out on Blu-ray. But they also offer some tips that might just help extend the franchise. In Manhattan playwright Kermit and his manic troupe of pint-size puppets head to the Big Apple to turn his latest musical into a boffo Broadway smash. There they encounter a shady producer (Dabney Coleman) and sleep in bus-station lockers and poor Miss Piggy gets mugged. If this sounds more Midnight Cowboy than kiddie flick dont worry; the gangs plucky lets-put-on-a-show spirit keeps things fizzy and light. Cameos by Joan Rivers and Liza Minnelli dont hurt either. Space on the other hand makes the mistake of shifting the focus from everybodys favorite pig/ frog couple to Gonzo who it turns out is descended from space aliens leading to a close encounter no one asked for. Andie MacDowell Hulk Hogan Katie Holmes and Kathy Griffin all turn up. But like the rest of the movie they all seem...lost in space. Manhattan B+ Space C?

Directed by Timothy Hill. Written by Jerry Juhl Joseph Mazzarino and Ken Kaufman. (G. 82 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Arriving in the gross-out summer of ""South Park"" "" Big Daddy "" and ""American Pie"" theres something quaint and gentle about the fact that ""Muppets From Space"" even exists. The sixth feature film in the long-standing Muppets franchise it opens today. Going where few movies dare to go ""Muppets From Space"" is the G-rated profanity-free adventure of Gonzo the homely tube-nosed misfit whos always wondered where he came from. Small kids ought to love this entry but die-hard Muppet fans are likely to find it tepid and uneventful -- a minor addition to the Muppet canon. When Gonzo discovers hes actually an alien from a distant planet and announces it on a talk show hosted by Miss Piggy he becomes the target of a sinister CIA-like ""National Security Facility."" Eventually he has to make a choice between venturing into space to join his own kind or remaining on Earth with his beloved friends. The ageless Miss Piggy is on board relishing her role as a broadcast journalist (""Its 1 a.m. and my hair still looks great"") as are Kermit the Frog Fozzie Bear and Animal. Rizzo the Rat who sounds like San Francisco Supervisor Tom Ammiano has sidekick duty and a cute moment when he buffs up by bench-pressing the bar of a mousetrap. The gang lives in a dilapidated boardinghouse where Gonzo receives alien messages spelled out in his alphabet cereal. When hes kidnapped by a bumbling government operative (Jeffrey Tambor of ""The Larry Sanders Show"") and threatened with lab experiments and brain surgery his pals naturally mobilize a rescue mission. ""Muppets From Space"" introduces three Muppet characters in Bobo the Bear Dr. Phil Van Neuter and Pepe the Giant Prawn (hes the noseless one with carrot-colored hair) and offers the usual roster of celebrity cameos David Arquette as a mad scientist Kathy Griffin and Ray Liotta as government security guards Pat Hingle as an Army general Rob Schneider as a TV producer and Andie MacDowell as Shelley Snipes the glamorous TV anchor for ""UFOMania."" Griffin develops a major crush on one of the Muppets but MacDowell gets the juiciest scene when Miss Piggy tries to steal her job and the two of them lock horns for some hair-raising diva-fu. Even with its references to ""Star Wars"" and ""Men in Black"" ""Muppets From Space"" is awfully low-tech by most space- movie standards and probably will play as well on video as it does on the screen. Although younger kids are its likely audience the filmmakers have tossed in a bonus for their parents a soundtrack of 70s funk tunes from Billy Preston Earth Wind amp; Fire and Kool and the Gang. ""Muppets From Space"" was directed by Tim Hill who created Nickelodeons ""Action League Now"" and makes his feature film debut here. It was produced by Brian Henson whose father Muppet creator Jim Henson died in 1990.

The mildness of ""Muppets From Space"" may come as a great relief to parents desperate for G-rated entertainment during the warm-weather months. But do moppets still love Muppets? At a recent preview screening grade-schoolers and pre-schoolers seemed neither restless nor enraptured. The sixth full-length feature to showcase Jim Hensons immensely popular puppets is a modestly clever comedy in which nothing not even the wild and crazy ravings of the unpredictable Animal gets seriously out of hand. The mildness of ""Muppets From Space"" may come as a great relief to parents desperate for G-rated entertainment during the warm-weather months. But do moppets still love Muppets? At a recent preview screening grade-schoolers and pre-schoolers seemed neither restless nor enraptured. Pic likely wont find its widest and most enthusiastic audience until it appears as a sell-through homevid item. Departing from the formula employed in the last two Muppet movies -- ""The Muppet Christmas Carol"" (1992) and ""Muppet Treasure Island"" (1996) -- the new installment goes back to basics and places the title characters in a contempo setting. Kermit the Frog Miss Piggy Rizzo the Rat and all the other cloth-and-foam-rubber creatures share cramped but comfortable digs in a weather-beaten old house. For the most part joy prevails. Right from the start however it appears that the bent-beaked Gonzo (voiced by Dave Goelz) is even more of an odd man out than usual. The opening dream sequence in which a skeptical Noah (F. Murray Abraham) refuses to admit Gonzo aboard the Ark because he doesnt have a mate underscores the poor little guys main concern There is no one (or nothing) quite like him on Earth. His mood lightens only when he begins to receive cryptic messages (""R U There"") in his Capt. Alphabet breakfast cereal. Based on this and other evidence Gonzo snaps to the idea that maybe theres a good reason hes so unique -- that is maybe hes the offspring of extraterrestrials. At first Kermit and other cooler heads in the Muppet household try gently to dissuade Gonzo from trying to trace his roots. But when Miss Piggy lands a low-level job at a TV station she eagerly uses Gonzo as her stepping stone to replace a superstar reporter (Andie MacDowell) as the host of a ""reality"" series titled ""UFO Mania."" Unfortunately Gonzos on-the-air appearance attracts the attention of K. Edgar Singer (Jeffrey Tambor) the easily frazzled chief of a government agency charged with finding and capturing alien visitors. Agents grab Gonzo and transport him to the agencys headquarters where Gonzo befriends some lab rats who are regularly tormented by a mad scientist (David Arquette). Even worse things lie ahead -- Singer wants to remove Gonzos brain for closer scrutiny -- if Kermit Miss Piggy Fozzie Bear and Pepe the Prawn cant rescue their buddy in time. Working from a funny punny script by Jerry Juhl Joseph Mazzarino and Ken Kaufman director Tim Hill keeps things moving fast enough to meet the demands of short attention spans. Costumer Polly Smith production designer Stephen Marsh and the tech crew provide pleasingly bright and colorful visuals as attention-grabbing as anything found in most animated features. Gonzo is suitably engaging in his first starring role while roommate Rizzo the Rat (voiced by Steve Whitmire) provides wise-guy comic relief. Kermit (also Whitmire) remains as always serenely graceful under pressure. Miss Piggy (Frank Oz) is slightly less overbearing than usual and handles the occasional martial-arts mayhem with impressive aplomb. Once again however the comic genius of Fozzie Bear (also Oz) remains sadly underutilized. The humans co-stars -- including Ray Liotta as a security guard Rob Schneider as a TV producer and Hollywood Hogan (aka Hulk Hogan) as a Man in Black -- inhabit their roles with the usual amount of winking playfulness that actors usually exhibit in scenes opposite Muppets. They appear to be having a great time while being good sports and a certain amount of their joy is contagious. A few elements are aimed at grown-ups jokey references to ""Star Trek"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" (and weirdly enough ""The Shawshank Redemption"") a pop-tune soundtrack filled with disco and Ramp;B from the 1970s and early 80s. For the most part however pic is skewed toward a much younger demographic. Ultimately Gonzo has to choose between joining aliens on a trip back to their home planet or remaining on Earth with his Muppet friends. If his decision is the least bit surprising to you youre probably part of the target audience for ""Muppets From Space.""

O.K. so its not the first time these material creatures have stuck their beaks snouts and blobby little noses into the recycling bin in search of a cinematic vehicle but somewhere along the way they have gone Hollywood when they should be going Oz as in Frank Oz and Jim Henson who were present at the creation of the Muppets and stuffed their puffy fabric bodies with so much charm and no little wit. But instead of sending up their cinematic sources the creators of Muppets From Space rely too much on this spent screen fuel. Frenetic movement and loud music overwhelm warmth and compassion and the balance of character plot irreverent humor and innate decency that made some of the earlier Muppet movies so welcome is lost. So at the risk of sounding like Oscar the Grouch let it be said that Muppets From Space doesnt achieve exhilarating liftoff. But its bright colors high spirits brisk pace brief length and familiar characters making a lot of noise will doubtless seem an oasis of entertainment to many parents seeking a diversion for children on a hot humid summer day. Directed by Tim Hill a Nickelodeon alumnus in his feature-film debut and written by Jerry Juhl Joseph Mazzarino and Ken Kaufman Muppets From Space mixes the Muppets with human actors in a tale of longing and belonging built around Gonzo the Great. Poor Gonzo. He has been all alone ever since he can remember a period dating back in his nightmares to a time when Noah (F. Murray Abraham) turned him away from the Ark for being one of a kind (although Noah was kind enough to provide him with an umbrella). To his Muppet pals in the boarding house where they all live he describes himself as a one-of-a-kind freak. But kindly Kermit the Frog in one of the films rare moments of compassion tells him he is rather distinct. Gonzos life begins to change when he receives a message from his alphabet breakfast cereal instructing him to watch the sky. Soon Gonzos efforts to link up with his extraterrestrial relatives have brought him to the attention of a top-secret Government security agency and made him a springboard for the ambitions of Miss Piggy a television studio go-fer to displace Shelly Snipes (Andie MacDowell) as the host of a program called U.F.O. Mania. When Gonzo and his pal Rizzo the Rat are taken prisoner by the men in black the rest of the gang rides to the rescue in time to deliver Gonzo from the hands of a mad surgeon to the rendezvous point for linkup with his relatives from outer space. Here briefly Muppets From Space comes close to mixing its puppet stars its human cast its plot its messages its special effects and its music into a satisfying brew. Manipulated by puppeteers like Dave Goelz (Gonzo) Steve Whitmire (Kermit) and Mr. Oz (Miss Piggy Fozzie Bear Animal et al.) the puppets as performers remain magical even when their material is uninspired. The humans led by Jeffrey Tambor as K. Edgar Singer the paranoid Government alien hunter and including Ms. MacDowell Pat Hingle Ray Liotta David Arquette Rob Schneider and Hollywood Hogan lend themselves with admirable good will to the supporting roles.

In Muppets From Space it turns out that Gonzo is an expatriate alien. Having announced on Miss Piggys new talk show that theres a whole other world out there he is kidnapped by a paranoid government operative (Jeffrey Tambor snarling neatly) and its up to his fellow cloth-heads to break into a secret laboratory and save him. The Muppets were once devilish and sly but this ploddingly whimsical musical caper which uses too many 70s soul songs to signify its rainbow-demographic cred is enough to make you want to see them get slapped around by the Teletubbies (at this point a far funkier crew).
