Its not that shes bad in ""Monster-in-Law."" She seems to be having a high old time as Viola Fields an alcoholic TV diva. Violas lost her job to a younger woman and publicly lost her marbles attempting to strangle a Britney Spears look-alike on camera. Now shes about to lose her only son Kevin (Michael Vartan) to marriage. This final indignity prompts Viola to go nuclear on her prospective daughter-in-law Charlie (Jennifer Lopez). Fondas formidable comic chops deserve far better than the clumsy and charmless comedy concocted by novice screenwriter Anya Kochoff and director Robert Luketic.The premise though hardly fresh has the makings of a ferocious black comedy. But ""Monster-in-Law"" is more a sour pastel. Torn between the desires to be nasty and nice it achieves a mean-spirited blandness that makes neither psychological nor filmic sense. Its not Vartans fault but the object of this catfight comes off as an oblivious dolt hardly worth tussling over. Id cut this movie more slack if it had given me a few good belly laughs but the best it can do--thanks largely to Wanda Sykes as Violas sardonic assistant--is wring a few indulgent chuckles.Except for her role in ""Out of Sight"" Lopez has never seemed at home in romantic comedy. Dogged and earthbound when she needs to be sprightly and spontaneous she doesnt contrast well with Fonda--they both seem constructed out of steel. Were not surprised that Charlie proves as merciless as Viola is to her but its hard to delight in her revenge. The filmmakers dont even have the courage of their own misanthropy their desperate last-minute attempt to get touchy-feely must be seen to be disbelieved.

Lopez plays supposedly ordinary Charlie who meets supposedly attractive doctor Kevin (Michael Vartan) who has a supposedly controlling mother Viola (Fonda). Deciding to scare off her future daughter-in-law Viola fakes mental instability and moves in. Theres potential for humour in some of her methods - such as smacking Charlie in the face while feigning nightmarish sleep - but with poor timing jerky editing and a lack of strong comic actors this fails to deliver a punch. And while Fonda has a certain gravitas Lopez does little to make her character more sympathetic. With its cumbersome plot and clumsy humour Monster-in-Law belongs in the lower ranks of Meet the Parents rip-offs.

"One Tame Shrew washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies One Tame Shrew Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday May 13 2005 If there is nothing like a dame as Rodgers and Hammerstein have argued then why didnt the makers of ""Monster-in-Law"" hire a dame? Instead to play a mother-in-law calculated to frighten Godzilla they hired a lady. Shes a great lady of that theres no doubt but she doesnt seem to have the relish for battle the lust for blood that a true dame would have. I speak of course of Jane Fonda much ballyhooed in her return to filmmaking after 15 years. Fonda has been recruited to play the truly appalling Viola Fields a kind of Barbara Walters clone who jettisoned from her fancy network job turns all her fury and narcissistic self-regard into enmity toward the lush innocent whom her son whats-his-name is about to marry. I kept thinking how much better this film would be with a genuine USS Woman o War in the title role. Bette Midler call your agent. Meryl Streep move them Oscars on the mantel over to make room for this one Hey Glenn Close go to town Kathleen Turner why are you on Broadway when we need you? Its not that Fonda is bad. Shes not. Shes game brave even reckless willing to try a brand of physical comedy shes never tried before ready to risk looking foolish. Plus she looks fabulous. No its that her special thing as an actress has always been a certain tension; like her father she seemed a reluctant performer and that sense of repression of holding back was her signature. She even seemed fragile as a prostitute in her Oscar-winning performance in ""Klute"" all those years ago. In this film you never feel her characters need to dominate and humiliate and control things that other actresses might have brought to the role. And although the script gives her ample opportunity to show the wrong stuff she doesnt revel in it; as she confesses in her recent autobiography shes a pleaser and Viola by her very nature is a pompous displeaser. Then too she seems overpowered by Jennifer Lopez the betrothed who seems about as innocent as a snub-nosed .357 magnum no matter how hard she tries. You see this young woman and you think Shes nobodys chump. She knows the scene the angles the score. You wouldnt cross her and live to tell the tale. In this role shes all radiant sensual flesh and life force and her powerful body heat seems to make the super-thin Fonda waif-like almost porcelain. So there you have it In a movie about diva-to-diva warfare each diva is miscast. In fact as a performance vehicle the movie would make a lot more sense if the roles were reversed Lopez as Mother Death Fonda as Ms. Hospitality. As the movie sets up Fondas Viola a la Walters is on a first-name basis with all the heads of state in the Western world; but her reign is over and she loses her network job to a girl she thought had been sent to fetch coffee for her. Angry and near breakdown she makes an on-the-air lunge for the throat of a particularly stupid Britney Spearsian kewpie doll type during an interview. How a dame could have brought this one off Can you imagine the raptors glee with which a Midler or a Streep would have gone after that banal certitude of the dim young singer that almost Zen-pure emptiness? (A good line from Anya Kochoffs script The young singer doesnt approve of Roe v. Wade because shes against boxing). Meanwhile son Kevin the least doctorly doctor ever seen (hed be eaten alive by the predators on ""Greys Anatomy"") is jogging on the beach where he encounters the beautiful Charlie (J. Lo) walking dogs. He bumblingly starts a conversation to which she bumblingly responds. In todays hyper-sophisticated sexually powerful hook-up culture ""bumbling"" is of course code for sexual inexperience which also means ""nice"" ""innocent"" and of course ""borrrr-ing."" And they are. Anyhow soon enough the two have connected romantically. Though theres no apparent chemistry between them outside of the script Kevin asks for her hand. Viola is appalled because her son deserves so much better than someone so common. Whats the fuss about? The young actor who plays Kevin ---------------- is one of those utterly disposable Melrose Avenue faces lurking behind a half-weeks beard and a moppy tangle of hair occluded by a quart of mousse Vaseline or possibly even Valvoline. So vaguely did whats-his-name -- what is his name? -- register that he could have been exchanged with any of the young actors in ""Mindhunters"" and it would have affected neither movie a whit The film directed by Robert Luketic labors nearly an hour to set up this situation before it finally gets down to business which is Violas campaign to undercut the unworthy Charlie in any way possible while Kevin is so busy mussing his hair just so that he fails to notice. Charlie for her part seeks to muster the hidden strength to stand up to T-Rex in Gucci sandals. The two gals wage mujer-a-mujer combat for a while mainly in the form of Fondas prissy egocentric archness pitched against Lopezs insincere sincerity. Sometimes its kind of funny; mostly its not. Only Adam Scott who plays a gay friend of Charlies really registers (far more than whats-his-name; and okay his name is Michael something) and when you see him it will drive you nuts because he has a distinctively sharp face familiar from . . . somewhere. (To increase your movie-going pleasure let me ID him up front Scott played Howard Hughess oily Hollywood publicity guy in ""The Aviator."") Then theres Wanda Sykes in the straight-from-the-50s role as the sassy black maid a cliche that didnt need to be reinvented for our time. Youd expect her in a movie starring Henry not Jane Fonda. Sykes tries hard and she too registers with some force but the part was just unnecessary. In the end ""Monster-in-Law"" is so tame and limp it may actually give mothers-in-law a good name. Monster-in-Law (102 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for sexual references (but no sex) and some profanity.

Now please try not to kill each other. 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Monster-in-Law Comedy. Starring Jane Fonda Jennifer Lopez and Michael Vartan. Directed by Robert Luketic. (PG-13. 101 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Theres something about ""Monster-in-Law"" that wants to be seen. Its a crude obvious comedy which occasionally clunks but its often very funny as well as being a really shrewd bit of popular entertainment. Its appeal resides in a lot of things not the least of which is a sophisticated awareness of what an audience brings to it. Thus its funny because its funny. But its also funny because its Jane Fonda. And its funny because its Fonda and Jennifer Lopez together. Fonda has made comedies before but in her 15-year absence from the screen she has become fixed in the public mind as a serious personage -- as a dramatic actress of historical importance a role model to some and a figure of lingering resentment to others. ""Monster-in-Law"" allows Fonda to leave her legend off-screen and yet to benefit from it at the same time. Her skill at knockabout comedy -- her timing her physicality -- would amuse a visiting Martian. Yet theres no question that knowing who this game old dame is makes it all the more fun. ""Monster-in-Law"" does something else smart. It provides Fonda with a role that acknowledges her age while giving her a series of contexts in which to look like a million bucks. She plays Viola a TV newswoman and a talk show hostess -- someone with a long huge career like Barbara Walters -- whose contract is terminated by network grandees in search of the youth demographic. Minutes after getting her walking papers she interviews a 17-year-old pop star (a Britney Spears look-alike). She snaps lunges at her and tries to strangle the girl on camera. Related Stories Fonda Lopez romp through generation gap This is the kind of humor at work in ""Monster-in-Law."" Not subtle but effective. Cast opposite Fonda is Jennifer Lopez who as Charlotte plays a completely different kind of woman. Instead of one great career Charlotte has several modest ones as a dog walker a waitress and an office temp. Shes even-tempered not controlling; easily pleased and not demanding. Shes also physically soft where Viola is aerobicized. She meets a guy (Michael Vartan) -- one of those handsome guys who always needs a shave but is too indecisive to grow a beard -- and he turns out to be a doctor. When they get serious he brings her over to meet ... his mother. Most of the movie consists of scenes between Lopez and Fonda meetings of earth and fire. Excuses are found to throw them together as Viola -- recovering from a breakdown and intent on managing her sons life -- tries to drive Charlotte away. In one scene she invites dignitaries from all over the world to her house and goes around introducing Charlotte. (""And this is Charlotte. Shes a temp."") The strategies escalate as the movie goes along. Much of the comedy of ""Monster-in-Law"" derives from knowing what Viola is up to -- she discusses all her plans with her long-suffering personal assistant (Wanda Sykes) -- and seeing how she strains to maintain a veneer of sweetness. The spectacle of that strain and those moments when the mask slips are exploited by Fonda to maximum effect. Shes also good at the physical side of the role not just in the moments of slapstick but in expressing character detail through body language. Violas breezy and yet grand way of walking for example connotes a lot of things at once Long-term success genuine magnificence and inner fraudulence. Lopez warms to playing opposite Fonda as Charlotte gradually loses her deference toward a woman out to destroy her. Charlotte comes into her strength and theres pleasure in that a pleasure heightened by the extra pleasure of seeing Fonda and Lopez -- and the kinds of strengths they embody -- presented side by side. The appeal of this can be over-analyzed. Mainly its just delightful to see just as its delightful that Viola thinks Charlotte is fat. ""Monster-in-Law"" is a generational spectacle thats fun to witness. -- Advisory This movie contains sex talk.

By  Lisa Kennedy PUBLISHED May 11 2005 at 139 pm | UPDATED May 13 2016 at 321 pm Sign up for newsletters and alerts Submit your news tips or photos Most Popular Donald Trump stumps in Colorado promises ""No more Mr. Nice Guy"" Chris Harris INT injuries and 8 other observations from Day 2 of Broncos training camp Broncos offensive line can live with the blame game. Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Sometimes we just have to mourn the things that might have been. ""Monster-in-Law"" - a movie that begged to be greenlit for its clever title alone - provides such an opportunity. Only its never a good thing when a comedy has you wearing black. The title turns out to be one of the best pieces of writing in a film that has few fresh zingers and fewer insights into the anxieties of meeting the Parent. Jennifer Lopez plays Charlotte or ""Charlie."" As lovely and energetic as she is Charlie has been on romantic hiatus. We learn this because the script gives her an obligatory conversation with her two best friends that exists purely to bring us up to speed. Shes a dog walker a medical office assistant a caterer but what Charlie really wants to be is an artist. This we learn because one of the films first shots shows her sketching. When Charlie spies Dr. Kevin Fields (Michael Vartan from ""Alias"") - once twice a third time - she believes shes found the man of her future. As the title promises ""Monster-in-Law"" is not a courtship movie but a ""what happens after the relationship gets serious"" flick. The monster in question is Kevins mother Viola. The true draw of ""Monster-in-Law"" should have been Jane Fondas return to the big screen. Fifteen years have passed since the Academy Award winner appeared in a movie. ""Stanley and Iris"" with Robert De Niro was her last. Viola Fields would seem a perfect character to bring Fonda out of semi-retirement. A news anchor shes comfortable chatting up heads of state and bossing around her personal assistant Ruby (Wanda Sykes). Shes a woman who has mastered her domain - and a woman of a certain age who is about to get the heave-ho. When a Britney Spears lookalike sends her over the edge she winds up at a mental- health facility. A woman on the verge of recovering from a nervous breakdown Viola is threatened when she learns of her sons new love. Violas breakdown is no more believable than the one that sent Nicole Kidmans character to the burbs in last summers ""Stepford Wives"" remake. What is it about the inability of films to envision what the vulnerability of a powerful woman might actually look like? Wounded sure. Over the cliff no way. Threatened by her only childs new love OK. But do the filmmakers really think Viola would rather see her son with ambitious Fiona (Morgan Mazur) the sort of empty vessel that replaced her at the network? Fonda does her part. She looks edgy and fabulous as she commands another martini from Ruby. (Stand-up wonder Sykes has a role that squanders her true wit nearly reducing her to a modern-day Buelah.) This lack of subtlety makes Charlie an even tougher sell. J.Lo the public conglomerate has made it difficult for Lopez the actress. The damage is not irreparable but it requires Lopez to choose characters that dont suppress her natural strength. Not until Charlie lets Viola know shes onto her tricks does Lopez ring true. With all this female power on tap ""Monster-in-Law"" turns out to be a movie for the ""Bachelorette"" set. The first hint of this is how easily Charlies artistic talent gets lost in the rush to nuptials. ""Monster-in-Law"" is screenwriter Anya Kochoffs feature- film debut and it hardly seems fair to saddle her with the films failings. Yet director Robert Luketics track record is solid enough. As broad a comedy as it was his debut ""Legally Blonde"" let Reese Witherspoon charm and shine. And as slight as ""Win a Date With Tad Hamilton"" was it had plenty of moments of sweetness. With Fonda and Lopez this comedy boasted the talent. Had the script paid more attention to its characters emotional details this ""Monster"" could have been a ball.

YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Jane Fonda Jennifer Lopez or Create your own Manage alerts | What is this? (CNN) -- Jennifer Lopez is a multi-talented beautiful woman. When she picks the right material -- such as ""Selena"" or ""Out of Sight"" -- she also shows shes a very capable actress.But like a hound dog with a bad head cold her instincts are often off the mark. Her latest effort ""Monster-in-Law"" is only saved -- by the skin of its teeth -- by her co-stars Jane Fonda and Wanda Sykes.After a 15-year self-imposed exile from Hollywood Fonda the 67-year-old multiple Academy Award winner is back -- and she lets it rip in ""Monster-in-Law.""Its her first comedy since ""Nine to Five"" in 1980 and she takes what has become a standard rather trite paint-by-numbers Lopez vehicle (think ""The Wedding Planner"" and ""Maid in Manhattan"") and elevates it to a whole new level. I wouldnt go as far as to say she single-handedly makes lemonade out of lemons but she adds some much-needed sweetener. She also adds a cross-generational appeal that can only help at the box office.Fonda is supported by standup comic-turned-actress Sykes who delivers a wonderfully deadpan performance. Whenever the two appear in a scene together the screen lights up and the comedy kicks into high gear.However they dont enter the story until about 15 minutes into the film. Making it through those minutes is like wading through mud.Mixing it upLopez plays Charlotte ""Charlie"" Cantilini a no-nonsense independent young woman holding down a number of jobs -- including dog walker. Its while walking those dogs that she runs into Mr. Right in the form of Dr. Kevin Fields -- a rather bland dreamboat with perfect teeth -- played by Michael Vartan.They exchange a brief ""I want to jump your bones"" look but she keeps seeing him time after time over the next few days. In Hollywood terms thats called ""meeting cute."" Cuteness wears real thin real quickly.Before you can say ""havent I seen this film before on the Lifetime channel?"" theyve fallen in love and moved in together. At this belated point -- actually its just in time in terms of saving the film -- Kevin decides its time for Charlie to meet his dear ol mom.Bad move. Viola (Fonda) has just been fired from her job as a high-powered Barbara Walters-type interviewer. After suffering a meltdown on national television -- when she tries to strangle a Britney Spears clone -- shes committed to a posh mental hospital. Wanda Sykes who plays the Fonda characters assistant is one of the movies bright spots.Her career in shambles she retreats to her huge mansion to continue her recovery with Sykes as her loyal assistant Ruby in tow. At this point Junior appears with his dog- walking girlfriend and during tea proposes marriage to Charlie right in front of his decidedly unstable mother.Viola puts on a paper-thin brave front but secretly begins plans -- with Rubys help -- to break up the engagement by becoming the mother-in-law from hell. At first Charlie tries to appease Viola but that proves to be impossible.Soon she begins to fight fire with fire and the two women find themselves in a pitched battle over Kevins future. Kevin of course is completely clueless throughout all this obvious turmoil right up until the predictable ending of the film.Flawed date movie""Monster-in-Law"" is the screenwriting debut for Anya Kochoff. Shes created great roles for Fonda and Sykes who both milk them for all their worth. Shes also written a character for Lopez which unfortunately keeps her firmly in her romantic comedy comfort zone -- a zone which has become a rut.Elaine Stritch also makes an appearance as Violas mother-in-law one that is (almost) worth the price of admission.Vartan however is mainly reduced to eye candy. To be fair though this is a film written by a woman for women; how many thousands of other films can you name where the women are merely props for the men who take center stage?Director Robert Luketic (""Legally Blonde"" ""Win a Date with Tad Hamilton"") clearly has a gift for comedic timing and guides his actors with a light and loving touch.Even with its many flaws ""Monster-in-Law"" has some hilarious moments and will surely please its target audience. Its a fairly good date movie and with June just around the corner -- the years favorite month for weddings -- it might also be a great night out for soon-to-be brides and their future mothers-in-law. Moreover its nice to have Fonda back.But J.Lo you may want to find a new agent.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for 1.99 Review Perfect Man fatally flawed CNN/Money What TVs most popular dads earn Poll Most prefer to watch movies at home Cruise Holmes engaged to marryCNN/Money Security alert issued for 40 million credit cards Bin Laden deputy sends message U.S. House votes to keep U.N. dues Iran poll to go to run-off ALL AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE DC FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY International Edition Languages --------- Arabic German Japanese Korean Turkish CNN TV CNN International Headline News Transcripts Advertise With Us About Us SEARCH The Web CNN.com (c) 2005 Cable News Network LP LLLP.

Los obsession with marriage? Not a fighting chance Jane Fonda plays the domineering mother of the groom and Jennifer Lopez is the working-class bride-to-be. New Line Productions Two of Jennifer Lopezs earlier movies The Wedding Planner and Maid in Manhattan and now Monster-in-Law are concerned with idyllic unions. Even Enough in which she played a bride who takes revenge on her abusive husband began with a seemingly ideal marriage. Is she working out her much-publicized relationship issues on film? Are these wish-fulfillment fantasies? Do we even care? Lopez like a handful of other actresses was better early in her career. She displayed charisma in Selena and an ability to set off romantic sparks in Out of Sight. (Though the latter perhaps was more the doing of director Steven Soderberghs clever editing and co-star George Clooneys undeniable charm.) As she has become a celebrity Lopez has selected a succession of particularly insipid movies. About the movie Monster-in-Law  1/2 (out of four) Stars Jennifer Lopez Jane Fonda Michael Vartan Wanda Sykes Director Robert Luketic Distributor New Line Cinema Running time 1 hour 42 minutes Rated PG-13 for sex references and language Opens Friday nationwide And then theres Jane Fonda. After starring in such seminal films as Klute Coming Home and On Golden Pond why would she choose this formulaic clunker for her return to the big screen after a 15-year hiatus? Comedy was never her strong suit but she gamely does the best she can with the cliched part of the formidable mother of the groom. But the best and only funny lines go to Wanda Sykes who plays Fondas put-upon assistant. Lopez and Michael Vartan who plays her fiancee make a great-looking pair. Too bad they dont exhibit one iota of chemistry. Not for a second do we believe theyre a couple or even that he and Fonda are mother and son. Its as if the three were in separate movies and someone spliced them together. (Related items Tune in for more Vartan | Watch the Monster-in-Law trailer) The movies premise is clear from the title. Lopez and Vartan meet cute and fall in love. Then he introduces her to his controlling dynamo of a mom a Barbara Walters-style celebrity journalist whose career is coming to a crashing halt. We see her interviewing a Britney Spears-type celeb quite a comedown from her earlier interviews with presidents (four of whom came on to her she brags). But shes intense. And shes convinced that no one is good enough for her precious son. Especially not Lopezs working-class Charlie who though she studied fashion design has held a string of humdrum jobs such as dog walker and medical receptionist. Lopez is treacly sweet to Fonda and finally attempts some tepid revenge about two-thirds of the way through. But too late Weve lost interest. Fonda tries to make the best of the kind of part thats been going to Candice Bergen lately (Miss Congeniality Sweet Home Alabama). But her heart isnt in it. Lopezs performance is a notch less wooden than her trance-like portrayal in Shall We Dance or her laughably preposterous tough gal in Gigli. But that doesnt make the movie worth watching -- even if youre monstrously bored.

"Fondas Monstrosity washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On On Screen Fondas Monstrosity That battle is on in ""Monster-in-Law"" a comedy about Viola a vindictive has-been TV host (Jane Fonda left) who objects to her sons bohemian fiancee Charlie (Jennifer Lopez). (By Melissa Moseley -- Associated Press) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday May 13 2005 EAGERLY AWAITED for Jane Fondas return to the screen after a 15-year absence ""Monster-in-Law"" practically begs for an actress capable of delivering an energetic stem-winding performance in the title role. Or does it? Fonda playing the washed-up alcoholic TV host and aging multi-divorcee Viola Fields lays down a loud abrasive vaguely incestuous imitation of Lady Macbeth. Her mission in this case is not murder but character assassination when it becomes clear to Viola -- if no one else -- that her handsome and newly engaged doctor son Kevin (Michael Vartan) is marrying beneath himself when he proposes to a bohemian artist named Charlie (Jennifer Lopez). Unfortunately under all the histrionics and the increasingly over-the-top machinations Fondas crotchety Viola seems less in need of a Geritol than perhaps another midmorning martini to bring her energy level down a notch. What is most ironic is that the still-feisty Fonda consistently allows her character to be upstaged by . . . her own sidekick. With little more than a judiciously raised eyebrow here and there and some acid-tongued asides Wanda Sykes as Violas personal assistant Ruby steals the spotlight from the star again and again. Oddly that isnt because Fonda isnt trying hard enough but because shes trying too hard. Mostly I blame first-time screenwriter Anya Kochoff not Fonda. Why for example does Viola take such a violent and instantaneous dislike to Charlie after only one meeting? Because she slurps her tea? Come on Charlie is obviously a beautiful articulate and talented young woman. If either character were given more well character to work with -- if Charlie say were shown to be considerably more out of her element in or hostile toward her future mother-in-laws upper-crusty world -- Violas antipathy would make more sense. As it is Charlie is so wonderful about everything that Violas ill will comes across less like snobbery (or even insanity which would be my second choice) than racism. And casting a Latina in the fish-out-of-water role seems a kind of crude shorthand on the part of the filmmakers meant to telegraph uncultured uncouth and unsophisticated . Whats more Kevins obliviousness to his mothers egregious behavior is to put it mildly implausible. How did this guy make it through medical school when he cant see that Viola is a harridan bent on derailing her only sons wedding? Dont you see Kevin rationalizes to Charlie Mother is just being a little ""difficult"" a little ""challenging"" but I still adore her. Now Ive heard of mothers only a son could love but this is ridiculous. At one point after Viola has managed to move in with Charlie and Kevin -- the better to torture her my dear -- Viola even tries to poison Charlie who is allergic to nuts by serving her gravy laced with crushed almonds. While this episode is treated as a lark by Kochoff and the director Robert Luketic (""Win a Date With Tad Hamilton"") I couldnt help thinking that the threat of death by anaphylactic shock was somewhat out of place in a light comedy. To be sure ""Monster-in-Law"" has its comedic moments especially when Charlie finally gets wise to Violas scheme to drive a wedge between her and her fiance and starts to fight back with an arsenal of ever more creative psychological weapons. But the comedy for the most part is so weighed down by the grinding heavy-handedness of Violas unpleasant character and by Fondas inability to find a way to strike a balance between the scripts disconnect from both reality and farce that this ""Monster"" is ultimately one flat-footed beast. MONSTER-IN-LAW (PG-13 101 minutes) -- Contains some obscenity sexual humor and comic violence. Area theaters.

The set of that precisely defined jaw inherited with a ton of other baggage from her famous father grew tighter by the hour as this survivor of serial male domination slogged grimly through the account of why shed succumbed with so little fight to her irascible dad and the philanderers she subsequently hitched herself to. Over and over she told interviewers that she felt she deserved no better and Im sure thats true. Life with Henry (their relationship was painfully etched into the barely fictional On Golden Pond) and a suicidal mother was probably enough to make any woman feel that she deserved no better than the husbands she got. Still watching Fonda pare herself down to a single therapeutically fortified narrative in which she ""takes responsibility"" for her wretched choice of partners was scary and dispiriting. By any measure the actress and activist has led a colorful life and shes done good works by the score most of which are listed in lieu of her many film roles in the production notes for her new movie. Im happy for her and the millions of women who look up to her that she ditched the breast implants and got herself otherwise empowered. But one hopes in a very rich woman of 67 for a little less steely self-absorption and a touch more humor about the common and uncommon mistakes shes made. If nothing else her new movie Monster-in-Law gives Fonda the opportunity to lighten up and show off the virago within. God knows the movie has precious little else to offer even with the reliably radiant Jennifer Lopez onboard to play the unsuspecting competition for mommie dearests precious son. A protracted monster-mom joke of the most predictable kind Monster-in-Law was written by Anya Kochoff who is good for the occasional gag line but not to be depended upon for dialogue that anybody might actually say and directed by Robert Luketic with considerably less verve than he brought to that amusing trifle Legally Blonde. Kochoff calls Monster-in-Law a ""bride-as-underdog"" story and it will do barely as a cautionary date movie for the young and marriage-minded. But if the screening I attended is anything to go by this is a gay mens movie whose primary function is to doll Fonda up like a drag queen and let her rip.But not before a leisurely introduction to her prey Charlie (Lopez) a lowly temp who it goes without saying is a gifted painter when off duty. So sweet is Charlie that she kisses a photo of her dead parents before leaving for work each day and is endlessly forbearing with her endlessly kooky Melrose Place pals (Adam Scott and Annie Parisse). She falls for Kevin (Michael Vartan) a young physician with excellent teeth who will have little to do for the duration but wring his hands while the cats fight. Before you can say cut-scene-two Charlie and Kevin are shacked up and planning a becomingly modest little wedding. Enter Mom a.k.a. Viola a recently fired talk-show host of the Murphy Brown variety with other ideas about everything from the color of the bridesmaids dresses to the suitability of this fortune-hunting hussy or any other for her beloved offspring. She moves in throws dishes and hissy fits changes outfits like a runway pro and manipulates the hell out of the good-natured bride-to-be. Lopez who is not built for demure only comes into her own when she begins to respond in kind and from then on you can set your alarm for the bitch-slapping sequence followed by home truths reconciliation and joyful nuptials.Hysteria doesnt come naturally to the reserved Fonda but she throws herself into this melee like a trouper and really shes awfully sweet with her hair all mussed or pitched face-forward into a plate of horrible food or as a wrathful vision in peach frills. Too bad that shes both upstaged and outflanked first by comedian Wanda Sykes who gets all the best lines as Violas less than long-suffering assistant Ruby and then by the ineffable Elaine Stritch who shows up for a showstopping cameo as Violas own implacable mother-in-law. If Luketic can field this lot theres no telling what hell do with the monster moms in his next project a feature adaptation of the prime-time soap Dallas.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm Monster-in-Law may be warmed-over camp but just in time for Mothers Day it does have one thing going for it. Though hardly flattering its the most affectionate and forgiving celluloid portrait of a mom Ive seen since Albert Brooks far superior Mother. Even a cursory rummage through recent American cinema feels like a ride through a maternal hell peopled with timid neurotic controlling or critically absent mother figures. Consider the smiling ballbusters played by Ellen Barkin and Debra Monk in Todd Solondzs Palindromes or Tea Leonis weak possessive widow in David Duchovnys House of D or Emily Mortimers overprotective single mom in Dear Frankie. Howard Hughes mother appears as a 60-second bookend at either end of The Aviator just long enough to set her up as the cause of all his troubles. Meryl Streep gives a delicious performance as the conniving bitch ruining Liev Schreibers life in The Manchurian Candidate. As a vagina with teeth she is outshone only by that nice Mrs. Goebbels in Downfall calmly popping cyanide pills into her sleeping childrens mouths so that they can follow the beloved Fuhrer into eternity. Bridget Jones mum is flighty and narcissistic. Mean Girls has one of those cringe-making mothers who want to dress like their daughters and be their girlfriends. In Tarnation Jonathan Caouettes childlike manic-depressive mom is at once the love and the scourge of his life. And my 7-year-old recently asked me why all the childrens movies we see -- Lemony Snicket Finding Nemo Fly Away Home to name but a few -- begin with dead or fled mothers. Not to mention the wicked stepmothers or godmothers like the scheming blue-rinsed fairy in Shrek 2. Theres nothing especially new about all this foaming ambivalence which reaches way back before Now Voyager and the psychoanalytically inspired maternal dramas of the 30s and 40s to the Brothers Grimm back through Lady Macbeth to the wrathful goddesses and black widows of ancient Greece. In childrens tales mothers are sent packing in part for plot purposes to open a path to trouble and adventure for their unprotected offspring. But you dont have to be Freud to understand the churning love and murderous rage aroused in all of us and particularly in the men who mostly remain in charge of our storytelling by the one woman who from our babyhood has exercised absolute control over our helplessness. No wonder pop history is littered with maternal putdowns. What is striking about the depiction of mothers in current cinema is its schizoid compartmentalization into gorgons and saints. Given the choice Ill take a well-rounded Medusa over a paragon any day. Im partial to the desperate housewives and I can get behind any movie virago if she has a bit of pep to her. The movie maters you have to watch out for are worthies like the truly scary Vera Drake a trembly whispering asexual blob of unmitigated self-sacrifice whose monolithic nobility I didnt believe in for a nanosecond. Fonda is loads more fun and persuasive losing it in Monster-in-Law than she is as a put-upon daughter or a mother paying perfunctory lip service to her children in interviews. Viola at least is not all mom -- shes a woman too and how rare is that at the movies these days? For my money the movie Mother of the Year is The Incredibles Elastigirl a brave and versatile chick who discovers that she can serve her family just as well as a long-armed savior of the world as by hanging up her hat in a suburban tract house.

This shrill undermotivated feature-length catfight between Jennifer Lopezs demure prospective bride and Fondas unhinged prospective mother-in-law makes sure to underline boldface and exclamation-point every plot turn and line of dialogue. Jane Fonda returns to the screen after 15 years as more a high concept than an actual character in ""Monster-in-Law."" This shrill undermotivated feature-length catfight between Jennifer Lopezs demure prospective bride and Fondas unhinged prospective mother-in-law makes sure to underline boldface and exclamation-point every plot turn and line of dialogue. No matter how undernourished the comedy and credibility may be however the allure of this star combo enacting this premise will prove irresistible to femme-driven mass audiences who will make New Lines gaudy romantic farce a big early summer winner. Revealing instincts more attuned to commercial hooks than to character insight or plausibility first-time scripter Anya Kochoffs story recycles fairy tale motifs from such previous Lopez vehicles as ""The Wedding Planner"" and ""Maid in Manhattan."" And by casting Fonda as a Barbara Walters-like TV host the film acknowledges the fact that Fonda may be more familiar to young contempo viewers as a celebrity wife-social activist-workout queen than as a thesp. Fondas grand entrance is preceded by 15 minutes of innocuous table-setting in which Lopezs Charlie is established as a good girl who juggles jobs as a dog walker medical receptionist and caterer to make ends meet -- and finally meets her dream man in the person of Kevin Fields (Michael Vartan) a successful young surgeon never lacking for three-day male model stubble. Within a minute of being introduced Fondas Viola Fields the very picture of an ultra-professional broadcast veteran is brought low by being summarily fired. On her final show she deliberately humiliates a dimwitted Britney Spears type by asking her serious questions about subjects like Roe v. Wade (the singer responds by claiming she doesnt follow boxing) before attempting to strangle her interviewee a move that sends Viola into therapy for months. Pic could have done with a little of Viola in her prime before the fall; as it is shes just a madwoman desperate to exert a semblance of the control and authority she formerly wielded. As it is the only target for her iron whim is her son Kevins new girlfriend. In a strange scene Kevin seizes the occasion of the first meeting between Viola and Charlie to get down on his knees and ask Charlie to marry him right in front of his mother. Notwithstanding the preceding gossip about how Kevin might be gay this is carrying the notion of a mamas boy to unprecedented lengths. More to the point however is how the scene points up Kochoffs having neglected to develop a personality for Kevin at all; for the only child of a fabulously wealthy career-obsessed celebrity whos just emerged from rehab Kevin has no issues at all. Hes a bland dreamboat enacted as such by Vartan. Which leaves things to the two women. Viola goes after Charlie because in her unfocused fury at the world she has nothing better to do; ""I am going to save my son"" she declares. First she throws a glamorous party meant to make the mere ""temp"" feel totally out of place. Failing at this Viola swings in the other direction by dictating every detail of the proposed wedding. At one point Viola demeans Charlie as a ""Latina"" unconvincingly so in that this sort of prejudice seems alien to her makeup. Finally the sparring becomes physical in a literal bitch-slapping contest that comes off as more inevitable than particularly outrageous or entertaining. When Violas onetime mother-in-law played by the ever-formidable Elaine Stritch at length turns up to restore order the effect should be far more satisfying than it is. But the sense is if Charlie can handle Viola shes going to roll right over the terminally tame Kevin now that shes got him all to herself. Looking tip-top and attractively photographed by Russell Carpenter Fonda brings a businesslike approach to her portrayal of irrationality and hysteria. Certainly shes the main attraction here as Lopez delivers her customary low-key emotionally open perf that provides easy but uncompelling access. Wanda Sykes provides verve to the borderline anachronistic role of Violas sassy black assistant who always has a remark to make about her bosss antics. Charlie has her own sidekick gay neighbor Remy (Adam Scott) to deliver quips about her choices. ""Legally Blonde"" helmer Robert Luketic is content to make the proceedings bright and snappy and leave it at that. Making things feel even more contrived and cutesy than they already are is David Newmans score a noodling creation that doesnt offer music so much as mood punctuation.

In Monster-in-Law the erstwhile Barbarella Hanoi Jane political activist fitness-tape mogul and Oscar winner plays Viola Fields a seasoned former TV journalist who in one of the many skirmishes she engages in with Jennifer Lopez as her prospective daughter-in-law passes out at the dinner table facedown into a plate of tripe. In doing so Fonda joins a select sorority of mature serious actresses made silly by the movies including Candice Bergen (dropped by a right cross in Sweet Home Alabama) Isabelle Huppert (covered in mud in I Heart Huckabees) and Barbra Streisand (riding Robert De Niro in Meet the Fockers). Whos come a long way baby? At first Fondas Viola is one of those career-obsessed ripe-for-chastisement media-biz news hens who have been around since His Girl Friday (and Network and To Die For). A steely Barbara Walters type she rules the TV roost until shes axed to make way for a younger and more cleavage-based talent. Then the imperious broadcaster breaks down takes a rest cure and returns as a pampered bitter drink-prone neurasthenic tended to by her wisecracking assistant (Wanda Sykes) and absorbed by a possessive (psychologists would diagnose the condition as ""icky"") fixation on her marriageable adult son Kevin (Michael Vartan) for whom no girl is good enough. That Kevin ostensibly an upstanding member of the medical profession is oafishly unaware of his mothers crazy-making manipulations and mischief is his own damn problem. Its Kevins reasonable announcement that he apparently like millions is in love with La Lopez (I mean that he wants to marry Charlotte ""Charlie"" Cantilini a freelance dog walker and would-be fashion designer) that turns Viola into a grotesque she-devil. Its an older womans acrid jealousy toward a younger one that threatens to sabotage a sons happiness by torturing his girlfriend. And its Charlies plucky knack for self-defense (at one point she drugs Viola to outwit the old cow) that leads to the sight of the 67-year-old Fonda glopped with guts and gravy. With comedy like this who needs Ann Coulter? And if vapid characters like Charlie are on the ascent as models of girl power what hope is there for the younger female contingent in the audience? That Viola actually socializes with world leaders is presented as an act of pretentious intellectual snobbery. Charlie dont know much about history dont know much geography (shes also a yoga instructor and party waitress when not sketching designs for gowns influenced by Bob Mackie) but what matters is that shes nice. Shes sweet. Shes got a gay best friend. Shes feisty and down-to-earth and unaffected and moderately talented yet another variation on the dewy Jenny-from-the-block conceit on which the glossy entrepreneur has built her empire Required to love the bride-to-be everyone does -- or else. (Sykes the resourceful comedian sprinkles what salt she can on the proceedings but even she is defeated by the inevitable.) The makers of Monster-in-Law -- which was written with little grace by first-timer Anya Kochoff and directed by Robert Luketic with the same insistent zest for girl-on-girl warfare he brought to Legally Blonde -- have their sights set on hitting the four-quadrant sweet spot pulling in younger and older male and female viewers. But in their eagerness to replicate the Meet the Parents formula for box office success (and in the summit-level negotiations required to accommodate the goals of both Fonda and Lopez) more harm is done than good. Looking marvelous as she does -- hurt blue eyes even more luminous figure trim self-presentation royal -- Fonda is readier than ever to acknowledge the striking serious artist of Klute she still has it in her to be. She could play tough if she wanted to or powerful or dangerous or sexual -- easily imaginable as a politician a lawyer a businesswoman a force who triumphs. And if the movies dont offer those roles to actresses over 50 well then screw the movies Get thee to television drama where seasoned actors of both sexes are the real stars. Law amp; Order CSI The Shield (viva Glenn Close) and any drama on HBO would benefit and benefit from Jane Fonda untroubled by a face full of gravy. As for Monster-in-Law its tripe on a plate.

"Monster-In-Law | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ...

Forgive me for a moment if I bemoan the lost potential here. Give a project like this to Danny DeVito whose War of the Roses existed in not dissimilar territory and the possibilities are endless. But with Robert Luketic at the helm the experience of viewing this movie represents a one-way ticket into tedium and a forced 90-minute imprisonment with Jennifer Lopez and Jane Fonda both of whom give performances that can charitably be called cringe-inducing. The story starts out stupid and gets worse from there. The first fifteen minutes are devoted to the development of an insipid romance between odd-jobswoman Charlie Cantilini (Lopez) and the perfect man Kevin Fields (Michael Vartan). No chemistry is evident but that doesnt matter since this isnt a romantic comedy. Once the romance has gotten serious enough Kevin decides to bring Charlie home to meet Mom ex-TV talk show personality Viola Fields (Fonda). For reasons known only to the screenwriters Viola takes an immediate and intense dislike to Charlie. (Supposedly this has something to do with Violas recent nervous breakdown coupled with her inherent belief that no woman is good enough for her son. In other words its a plot device that were not supposed to question.) Charlie and Viola spend the rest of the movie doing nasty things to each other behind the back of an oblivious Kevin who believes that his mother and bed-mate belong to a mutual admiration society. Most of the give-and-take between Charlie and Viola is sophomoric - stuff like Viola keeping Charlie up all night or inviting Kevins ex to a dinner party. Later in the film things get more serious. Charlie drugs Viola with a super-strong sleeping draught and Viola spikes Charlies gravy with crushed nuts (she is allergic to them). All this is a prelude to a sickening happy ending which is so unlikely that it wouldnt make sense even in the sunniest fairy tale. Presumably the thought of hard-edged ending never occurred to the producers. (Or if it did it was dismissed immediately.) Its hard to say who is more galling to watch - the robotic and uncharismatic Lopez who has long-since squandered the talent she showed in early-career films like Selena and Out of Sight - or Fonda who veers between being stony and stilted and offering a harpy-like caricature. Michael Vartan is so inconsequential as to be virtually invisible. The only ones to inject a much-needed spark into this otherwise unbearable motion picture are the irreverent Wanda Sykes (as Violas personal assistant) and Elaine Stritch (as Kevins grandmother) who is only on-screen for about five minutes. Take these two away and Monster-in-Law wouldnt have single bearable moment. The films director is Robert Luketic whose previous projects include Legally Blonde and Win a Date with Tad Hamilton Compared to Monster-in-Law those are examples of brilliantly nuanced comedy. This isnt the worst movie of the year but it is one of the least entertaining. Its 95 minutes but seems a lot longer. Although Sykes and Strich offer occasional breaks from the hum-drum monotony Monster-in-Law offers a glimpse through the window of what happens when formulas usurp intelligence in a screenplay. Somewhere buried beneath the dross theres the kernel of a delicious black comedy. Unfortunately in the hands of this filmmaking crew it remains beyond reach. Avoid this Monster at all costs.
