"The Haunted Mansion A Familiar Fun House washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids The Haunted Mansion A Familiar Fun House Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Jen Chaney Special to The Washington Post Friday November 28 2003 HERES A SENTENCE you probably never thought youd read Eddie Murphy is less offensive than Dr. Seuss. Its true at least when it comes to the two family films stuffing cineplexes this weekend. While Mike Myers sheds unfunny fur all over Seusss ""The Cat in the Hat"" (a comedy that should have been called ""The Crass in the Hat"") fellow ""Saturday Night Live"" alum Murphy takes top billing in the more entertaining less offensive ""The Haunted Mansion."" Yes a Disney movie based on one of its own theme park attractions is more tasteful than an adaptation of one of the most beloved childrens stories of all time. Go figure. In ""Mansion"" we meet Jim Evers (Murphy) of Evers amp; Evers Real Estate a workaholic agent with a Cheshire Cats grin and a Velveeta-smooth sales pitch ""We want you to be happy for evers and evers."" After missing an anniversary celebration with wife Sara (Marsha Thomason) who also hawks houses for a living Jim promises to put business on hold and take the family to the lake for a weekend. But before the couple and their two children -- meek 10-year-old Michael (Marc John Jefferies) and the older tougher Megan (Aree Davis) -- can leave Sara gets a phone call from a mysterious man who wants her to visit an old manor that may be up for sale. If youve ever heard a ghost story or watched a few seconds of a Scooby-Doo cartoon you can guess what happens next The whole family stops at the house en route to the lake. But they never get to the lake because it turns out the mansion is . . . haunted But you probably figured that out from the title right? Obviously ""Haunted Mansion"" isnt breaking any new narrative ground. Once inside the stately yet sinister estate the Evers family encounters all of the usual Draculas-castle-style creep-outs a ghastly butler (Terence Stamp); bookcases that lead to secret passageways; doors that breathe; and of course several creations that will look familiar to anyone whos ridden a Doom Buggy through the Haunted Mansion at a Disney amusement park. The Everses also slowly realize that the master of the house ghostly Edward Gracey (Nathaniel Parker) believes Sara is his long-lost love Elizabeth and wants to marry her. Dad and the two kids try to thwart that scheme with help from a pair of kindhearted specters (Wallace Shawn and Dina Waters) and crystal ball psychic Madame Leota (Jennifer Tilly). This latest in Murphys string of family vehicles isnt perfect. The comedy induces fewer giggles than it should and the plot raises questions that are never answered. How does a Victorian manor thats haunted mostly by British people end up on the outskirts of an American suburb? And wouldnt that massive mausoleum violate the covenants of the homeowners association? Alas these are mysteries that even Shaggy and Velma couldnt solve. Besides the point of ""Haunted Mansion"" is for audiences to sit back and enjoy the ride which is easy to do thanks to an engaging story the striking Gothic-inspired set by Oscar-winner John Myhre and some delightful special effects including the cemetery busts that double as a barbershop quartet. Though it might seem like ""Mansion"" should have been released at Halloween its underlying message about the importance of family over career fits nicely with the themes of Thanksgiving. And its arrival this weekend also gives moms and dads an alternative to that vulgar feline which may be ""Mansions"" greatest selling point.

Pic actually makes the messy ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" seem tidy. Curiosity should bring bucks. Contempo Hollywood may be awash in brilliant technicians and craftspeople but it also needs good storytellers who arent to be found in ""The Haunted Mansion"" Disneys second mega-budgeted project this year based on a Disneyland ride. Pic actually makes the bombastic messy ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" seem tidy well-told and funny in comparison. Precisely because its much more devoted to the details of its ride ""Mansions"" drab comic strokes and narrative render the movie almost superfluous. Nonetheless Eddie Murphys presence and a certain built-in curiosity should bring out family lookee-loos for the extended Thanksgiving weekend. Family factor a major part of David Berenbaums script may explain why Disney is launching pic during Turkey days rather than what would have seemed to be its natural Halloween slot. But Berenbaums ""Mansion"" script lacks the nose for witty surprises and disarming absurdity that he showed in writing the recent hit ""Elf."" The challenge for Berenbaum and for director Rob Minkoff was to find something to compliment the rides spectacle. The ride was perhaps the first of its kind that made even regular Disneyland visitors think twice about what it was they were actually seeing (it remains one of the great optical triumphs in the entire opus of creative work done under the Disney label). Possibly the rides extraordinary optical illusions just dont transplant well to the screen where visual trickery has become commonplace. Most difficult of all the filmmakers had to come up with a reason for characters to be cruising through a mansion stuffed to the brim with grinning grumpy and ghoulish ghosts of every hue all of them stuck here because of a century-long curse. But sending Murphys go-go real estate salesman Jim Evers and his family inside the manse -- substituting their reactions for what the rider experiences in a vivid three-dimensional environment -- is nothing more than the latest example of one-dimensional moviemaking. Jim has passed his agency leaflets out far and wide in his corner of Louisiana. Able to work every angle with his partner-wife Sara (Marsha Thomason) to close a sale Jim puts his job ahead of family at the cost of missing out on the lives of his two growing kids younger and easily scared Michael (Marc John Jeffries) and older smarter Megan (Aree Davis). Jims even late for his anniversary celebration with Sara and wants to make amends by taking the family out on a weekend trip. A phone call from an old man wanting to sell the mansion causes a detour in the holiday plans. One glance at the property complete with a creepy backyard cemetery would dissuade anyone but the most obtuse from entering -- which sets up a weak premise to start the rest of the action. And other reasons for turning right around come quickly first in the unsettling guise of the ashen-skinned butler Ramsley (Terence Stamp calmly channeling Vincent Price) then in the slightly out-of-body persona of the owner Master Gracey (Nathaniel Parker) who appears dressed for a 19th century-themed costume party and looks a bit too adoringly at Sara. Murphy tries to maintain his Everyman modus smiling his way through the oddest moments and being the last to accept that ghosts really exist. Production designer John Myhres spectacular set which mixes equal parts of ""House of Wax"" ""Rebecca"" and ""Citizen Kane"" has the effect of upstaging Murphy whos stuck with zero funny lines to fight back with. Jim Sara and the kids promptly get separated with Sara essentially held under house arrest by Gracey whos convinced that she is actually his dead love Elizabeth. Meanwhile Jim dashes around from one mild scare effect to another (such as his rotting face in the mirror) and Michael and Megan follow a floating orb upstairs where they encounter servants Ezra (Wallace Shawn) and Emma (Dina Waters) who inject a wee bit of Dickensian humor and intrigue. This pair hold some secrets as does Madame Leota (Jennifer Tilly) a Gypsy woman in a green-hued crystal ball and one of the rides most memorable characters. ""The Haunted Mansion"" suffers from a strange paradox The more new story elements are introduced the more they feel larded on to bring in more images and effects from the ride. The onslaught of design and effects overwhelm the plot with the climax reaching an otherworldly level of visual effects overload. Unlike ""Pirates"" few glancing nods to its Disneyland adventure ""Mansion"" is a full-on homage to the ride. Pics indisputable stars are Myhre costumer Mona May visual effects supervisor Jay Redd makeup maestro Rick Baker (whose skeletal zombies hardly get enough screen time) and lenser Remi Adefarasin. Cast by contrast is left far behind though Stamp holds up his end with a turn that develops into an extended spoof of the horror tradition of Corman and Hammer. Shawn and Waters might have been more amusing in a more modestly scaled production but Thomason is too plain her character almost vanishing like a ghost. Adherence to the ride extends to bookend quotes in graphic form (""Welcome Foolish Mortals"") and post-credit sendoff (""Hurry Back"") the latter sounding like wishful thinking.

(Related item See a clip from Haunted Mansion) Eddie Murphy learns the hard way in Haunted Mansion that nights in eerie estates seldom go well for celluloid characters. AP Photo/Walt Disney Pictures ""Just scoop a few of those fuzzy suckers off the script"" director Rob Minkoff could have said. Thats assuming the director of both Stuart Little movies wasnt in denial about his latest project. Maybe its just a comedians rite of passage. Eddie Murphy is only doing what Bob Hope Abbott and Costello Martin and Lewis that Ghostbusters crew and yes even Francis the Talking Mule have done before. But in those cases you believed that the actors hearts were halfway in it no matter how tough Francis career motivations were to read. Murphy (coasting again) plays a real estate agent in partnership with his wife (Marsha Thomason). On their way with the kids to a weekend of rare Ramp;R they stop off at an aged mansion whose owner wants to sell. Murphy says the visit with the prospective client will be just 20 minutes. But somehow through ""presto"" time compression that seems more plot-expedient than credible it turns into evening faster than you can say ""Pluto Nash."" The roads have been washed out in a rainstorm and guess where everyones sleeping? Ghosts take over though theyre all pushed around by a long-dead butler played by Terence Stamp (somewhere between taking the money and trying to deliver a professional performance). His master (Nathaniel Parker) believes that Murphys wife is a lover who committed suicide centuries earlier because they were from ""different worlds"" and thus were forbidden to marry. This sounds like understandable code language to avoid a racial specificity in a PG family release but maybe she was from Atlantis the Lost Continent. A Disney Thanksgiving movie that plays like a Halloween holdover is odd enough. Even so it wouldnt be that bad if you stuck your hand into the trick-or-treat bag and found a hefty succulently dressed and edible turkey instead of the other kind. The movies horror angle also reminds us of Vampire in Brooklyn the last in a string of Murphy flops before The Nutty Professor saved his screen career in 1996. With this listless foray Eddie is twice bitten.

After the successes of ""Daddy Day Care"" ... more Photo BRUCE MCBROOM Fixer-upper with more than a few skeletons in closet 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Haunted Mansion Comedy/horror. Starring Eddie Murphy Nathaniel Parker Terence Stamp Jennifer Tilly and Marsha Thomason. Directed by Rob Minkoff. (PG 99 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) When Disney announced it would adapt the theme park rides ""The Country Bears"" ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and ""The Haunted Mansion"" into movies it appeared to be strictly a business decision -- unprecedented commercialism from a company that once named a hockey team after a movie starring Emilio Estevez. But with an excellent ""Pirates"" and now a surprisingly decent ""Haunted Mansion"" it may be time to give The Mouse credit. ""Haunted Mansion"" wont be anybodys E-ticket ride but its an enjoyable movie for a very specific age range (children 8 to 12) and will be tolerable for almost everyone else. Like ""Pirates"" and ""Country Bears"" this movie includes several allusions to the Disney theme park ride but the messages are refreshingly subliminal. ""The Cat in the Hat"" included more money-grubbing product placement in its trailers than this film can fit in its entire 99-minute run. ""The Haunted Mansion"" takes place in modern times. Eddie Murphy plays Jim Evers a fast-talking real estate agent who doesnt spend enough time with his family including his wife Sara (Marsha Thomason) and two kids. On the way to a family outing Evers insists on taking a detour to the aforementioned Haunted Mansion where butler Ramsley (Terence Stamp suddenly looking like he needs a few quarts of O-negative) and Master Gracey (Nathaniel Parker) are harboring deep secrets. ""The Haunted Mansion"" really needed Murphy to conduct a Johnny Depp- style career comeback but it becomes clear from the opening minutes that its just not going to happen. Murphy seems to be channeling Jackie Chiles Kramers lawyer from ""Seinfeld"" and hes only sporadically funny. The rest of the movie follows Murphys lead -- the jokes are recycled (weve reached the point where screenwriters who use the phrase ""I see dead people"" in a movie should be stripped of their union benefits) and the acting is mostly After School Special quality. But the production values are high throughout the film starting with the mansion itself which is awash in spooky detail. The movie also has a brisk pace that was lacking in ""Pirates"" and several other summer movies aimed at kids. And what ""Haunted Mansion"" lacks in hilarity it makes up for in consistent dulling amusement with assistance from Jennifer Tilly as a crystal ball gypsy Wallace Shawn and Dina Spybey as two friendly servant ghosts and a quartet of harmonizing cemetery busts. Disney has a history of mining franchises for every dollar taking decent movies such as ""The Mighty Ducks"" and ""Air Bud"" and regurgitating sequels until the world was ready for Bud and Coach Gordon Bombay to both be put to sleep. With huge box office intake for ""Pirates"" and the probable success of ""The Haunted Mansion"" moviegoers should brace themselves for ""Mr. Toads Wild Ride"" ""Its a Small World"" and ""Monorail The Movie."" But if any of the above are as painless as ""The Haunted Mansion"" a little crass commercialism may be something we all can live with. -- Advisory There is a brief shot of a hanged man and a few scary ghosts and skeletons but most of the movie is played for humor.

Orange mans 2nd trial nets life term in killing - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Sentence Orange mans 2nd trial nets life term in killingJuly 10 2009|By Sarah Lundy and Amy L. Edwards Sentinel Staff WritersA judge sentenced a 22-year-old Orange County man to life in prison without parole Thursday in a 2006 fatal shooting during a drug deal gone wrong.Deangelo Conner was convicted last month of first-degree murder armed robbery and two counts of robbery with a firearm.Florida law required Circuit Judge Bob Wattles to sentence Conner to life in prison for the murder conviction.Conner had turned down a 25-year plea offer and took his chances at trial.His first trial ended in a mistrial after jurors were heard discussing the case before it was allowed.Authorities say Conner shot Ricardo Rivera 41 once in the chest July 6 2006.Conner and two others initially set up the meeting as a drug buy but they never intended to pay for anything the prosecution said; the three planned to grab the drugs and run.At one point Conner pulled out a gun and fired at Rivera. Conner told investigators that Rivera was charging toward him and he was merely protecting himself.The jury didnt buy it.Several of Ricardo Riveras relatives attended the sentencing including his children and brother Robert Rivera who read statements from several people.In a statement Ricardo Riveras ex-wife wrote that the hardest thing she has had to do was tell her children they no longer had a father.The woman wrote that her familys hurt will never go away.
