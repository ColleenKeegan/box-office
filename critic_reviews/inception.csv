STORY HIGHLIGHTS ""Inception"" is a spectacular fantasy thriller based on director Christopher Nolans screenplay Leonardo DiCaprio digs around in peoples subconscious while they dream ""Inception"" is the summers best bet to bust the blocks (CNN) -- ""I hate my dreams. Theyre so ... infantile."" Heaven knows what artist Laurie Anderson would make of Christopher Nolans first film since ""The Dark Knight"" but if audiences dont go for it were more likely to hear a different complaint Its just too darned complex. A spectacular fantasy thriller based on Nolans own original screenplay ""Inception"" is the smartest CGI head-trip since ""The Matrix."" The premise is so out-there it requires not just a leap of faith but also too much screen time to explain so do yourself a favor and pay attention. Leonardo DiCaprio is Cobb an ""excavator"" who digs around in peoples subconscious while theyre catching some zzzzs. This act of infiltration is ""not strictly legal""; the motive is not therapeutic but espionage and theft. Its also not a solo operation. To do the job properly requires an ""architect"" basically someone to design an appropriate dreamscape something vivid and detailed enough to keep the dreamers defenses down. Depending on the complexity of the project it might also require a ""burglar"" a ""chemist"" and preferably someone on the outside to administer a well-timed wake up call. Cobbs partners include Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt); a newbie Ariadne (Ellen Page); Yusuf (Dileep Rao); and Eames (Tom Hardy). Their client Saito (Ken Watanabe) wants more than access to a rival industrialists grey matter; he requires Cobb to plant an idea in there that will dismantle an entire conglomerate. As if that werent hard enough Cobb is also plagued with keeping his own demons at bay in the form of an angry dead wife (Marion Cotillard). DiCaprio evidently hasnt got ""Shutter Island"" out of his system yet. Video Dreams and Inception Video Christopher Nolans comeback film Video Film goes inside your dreams Video Stars shine at Inception premiere RELATED TOPICS Leonardo DiCaprio Hollywood Movie Reviews Entertainment A kind of meta-heist movie ""Inception"" evokes Philip K. Dicks cerebral sci-fi the exploration of alternate states of consciousness memory and fantasy. But these are also Nolans themes familiar from the amnesiac noir of ""Memento"" and the many varied mind-games practiced by the warring magicians in ""The Prestige"" as well as the psychological warfare between Batman and his adversaries (fans of that series will recognize several familiar faces popping up here). ""An idea is like a virus"" says Cobb and that idea too might have been born in Gotham City or in the rabid enthusiasm that greeted ""The Dark Knight."" Like ""Memento"" and ""The Prestige"" ""Inception"" is constructed as a box of tricks. Ariadne (who helped Theseus slay the minotaur in Greek mythology) devises labyrinths that are also escape hatches and that metaphor of the maze runs through ""Inception"" which is itself a puzzle to be navigated by filmmaker and audience alike. In the course of probing his subjects subconscious Cobb escorts him into a dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream. If its a little disappointing that each level plays out as a straight-up action thriller (this guy really should get out more) the rules of this game are delightfully devious. iReport Share your review of ""Inception"" He has a tendency to over-complicate but nobody bends time more ingeniously than Nolan. Three minutes in one dream might correspond to an hour in the next and both transpire in a matter of seconds up in the real world. Gloriously real world physics are refracted in the dream zones -- gravity just drops out like a faulty signal -- and if the dreamer starts to stir the universe crumbles. (The Big One the ultimate Angeleno nightmare.) It certainly hasnt escaped Nolans attention that this dream life functions as a metaphor for the movies. Ariadne is a production designer Cobb an actor-director. Extras in the dream -- ordinary passers-by -- are known as ""projections"" and they become hostile if they suspect that someone is messing with their reality. ""Inception"" only dabbles in the art of perception. For all its layering the movies depth remains on the surface. But with its grand clanging Hans Zimmer score its immense dazzling effects and audacious storytelling its the summers best bet to bust the blocks.

"Inception movie review Leonardo DiCaprio dives into a dream |       NJ.com comments Inception movie review Leonardo DiCaprio dives into a dream Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on July 16 2010 at 649 AM updated July 16 2010 at 655 AM View/Post Comments Stephen Vaughan""Inception"" stars Leonardo DiCaprio and is directed by Christopher Nolan. Joseph Gordon-Levitt treads his way carefully through a dream in the sci-fi thriller ""Inception."" INCEPTION MOVIE REVIEW There are two ways to react to ""Inception."" The first way is to sit there your mouth slightly open watching all the reality-tweaking scenarios on-screen -- and then after 15 minutes throwing up your hands and walking out. The second way is to sit there your mouth slightly open watching all the reality-tweaking scenarios on-screen -- and at the end putting your hands together in applause and making plans to come back. Count me in the second camp. Both the most challenging sci-fi movie since ""The Matrix"" -- and perhaps the most uniquely told film since director Christopher Nolans own stunning ""Memento"" -- ""Inception"" is definitely not for the ""A-Team"" crowd. Movie Review Inception (PG-13) Warner Bros. (142 min.) Directed by Christopher Nolan. With Leonardo DiCaprio Marion Cotillard Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Now playing in New Jersey. Ratings note The film contains violence and strong language. Stephen Whittys review THREE AND A HALF STARS Its just grade-A filmmaking. There are plenty of explosions sure and fight scenes and gadgetry. Theres Leonardo DiCaprio as the hero Marion Cotillard as the femme fatale and enough globe-trotting locations to fuel two 007 films. But it also takes place in the mind -- or rather in several minds at once as our heroes pursue their prize through dreams within dreams. In fact by the climax the action is occurring in at least four separate and simultaneous realities. To quote our old friend Neo -- ""Whoa."" As in ""Memento"" though the fractured storytelling is not only in service of the story its the only way to tell the story. Our hero Cobb you see is a thief of the subconscious -- hired by corporations to slip into a business rivals dreams and steal an idea. Or in this case plant an idea. Its a risky strategy but then this is a risky film. Audiences have become used to being passive creatures especially during the summer; ""Inception"" demands you pitch in too. If you want to enjoy the movie you have to be part of the team. Its a great team too starting with DiCaprio. Over the past few years hes played a variety of tortured characters. Unreliable narrators they understand neither themselves nor the world around them. And in ""Inception"" he takes us along for the mad ride. We have some help from Cotillard -- who hasnt given a bad performance yet and turns in another great heartbreaking one here. (Although Nolan is wrong to use Edith Piaf on the soundtrack; it feels like a cheap in-joke about Cotillards Oscar-winning turn in ""La Vie en Rose."") And theres a fully realized supporting cast -- from the ever-sly Joseph Gordon-Levitt to ""Batman Begins"" grads Michael Caine and Cillian Murphy to Ellen Page thankfully leaving her slangy ""Juno"" persona behind to play a whip-smart architecture student. But mostly theres Nolan who uses a rich variety of references -- from the mind-puzzling drawings of M.C. Escher to the ""Am I a man who dreamt he was a butterfly or a butterfly dreaming he is a man?"" koans of Chinese philosophy -- to drive this intricate game. It is a game too. A few of the allusions (Pages character is named after a Homeric heroine) turn out to be possibly deliberate dead ends. And the films ending -- it doesnt really conclude -- is just ambiguous enough to leave you wondering. Which is Nolans point. ""You create the world of the dream"" Cobb says early on explaining how he does it. ""You bring the subject into that dream and they fill it with their secrets."" Its a good clear description of how Cobb does what he does -- getting inside our minds and tricking us into helping. And its a job Nolan knows by heart.

Photo Credit Warner Bros. Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A dream thief invades the subconscious of a wealthy man. BOTTOM LINE Audaciously entertaining and packed with ingenious ideas; the years first must-see movie. CAST Leonardo DiCaprio Ellen Page Marion Cotillard LENGTH 228 Halfway through ""Inception"" a heist film of thrilling almost delirious complexity Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his team of dream thieves invade the mind of a wealthy industrialist (Cillian Murphy). Under a hail of real-enough bullets they make an unusual getaway They go to sleep again re-emerging in a swanky hotel which of course is only a shared dream within a shared dream. Still following? As Cobb prepares to pull this stunt a second (third?) time dream rookie Ariadne (Ellen Page) says whats probably on your mind ""Wait - whose subconscious are we going into?"" Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? The only person who truly knows is Christopher Nolan the writer director and producer of this enormously entertaining film. Whatever your questions - Why do dream bullets hurt? Can you kill yourself? How long is a dream minute? - Nolan has the answers though theyre too much fun to spoil here. And woven into the multilayered story is a subplot involving Cobbs not-quite-dead wife movingly played by Marion Cotillard which is nearly intricate enough for its own movie. As with ""The Dark Knight"" (2008) Nolan turns the humblest of genres - in this case a sci-fi-caper combo - into something approaching a masterpiece. ""Inception"" is one astounding set-piece after another free-falling bodies fistfights in a whirling hallway a symbolically crumbling Arctic fortress all strobing together in nested sequence. (Lee Smith Nolans longtime editor is the movies secret weapon.) The characters do a lot of explaining and defining - perhaps unavoidably in a world this detailed - and the film isnt above resorting to a little computer-generated sleight-of-hand. Mostly though ""Inception"" manages to amaze by simply outsmarting outpacing and genuinely surprising its audience. Thats a treat and one moviegoers dont experience often enough. EntertainmentTrailer Inception Its a dream come true for director advertisement | advertise on newsday Writer-director Christopher Nolan who turns 40 two weeks after ""Inception"" premieres said he dreamed up the idea about a decade ago as his independent hit ""Memento"" was opening studio doors for him. The British filmmaker said he has been toying with how to use dreams in movies since his teens. ""Ive become over the years more and more interested in the creative potential of the mind and the way that every night were able to create entire worlds"" Nolan said. ""The idea that you can be completely convinced while youre asleep that youre in a real situation and youve created this room or whatever and Ive created you as a person everything youre saying Im putting as words in your mouth but I feel that Im hearing them for the first time. That to me suggests infinite potential for human creativity an infinite mystery to the way the human mind works."" Hollywood has always been known as the land of dreams but filmmakers now have technology at their disposal to hurl audiences into worlds approaching the limitless possibilities of their unconscious projections.

Warner Bros/Everett Collection CultureLeonardo DiCaprio and friends are ninjas of the subconscious dashing through the landscape of other peoples dreams in Christopher Nolans Inception. This endlessly fascinating swirl of a film could have come only from Nolan who blends the cerebral twistiness of Memento (his thriller that moves backward in time) with the spectacular action of his Batman megahit The Dark Knight. DiCaprio as a thief-for-hire named Cobb doesnt merely skulk around sleeping minds pilfering strangers secret thoughts. He and his team complete with architect actually construct the dream worlds theyll enter with streets that can rise up and become walls--the city as Murphy bed--or if things go wrong a train roaring through city traffic. You may get a headache keeping up with the plot as Cobb tries to plant a new idea in a mans brain; stealing thoughts is simple but adding one is a risky operation involving a dream within a dream within a dream. Even as you tick off the films overload of references though--a Matrix here a James Bond there--the amazing effects and Cobbs quest carry you along.But Nolan is the brainiest of Hollywood directors and Inception is more than the ultimate ""it was all a dream"" movie. It is the most sophisticated in a year of splashy screen events about parallel worlds in which characters enter alternate realities and return with some solution to personal and often global problems. Cobbs dangerous assignment is meant to save the world from an energy conglomerate. Avatars hero goes to Pandora falls for its nature-loving people and learns to value the environment. The characters on Lost travel sideways to other times and places in what seems an attempt to escape the island but turns out to be a way to save their own souls. Even Tim Burtons Alice in Wonderland transforms Lewis Carrolls story into a journey of self-discovery fit for the 21st century. The movies Alice is a 19-year-old who returns from Wonderland realizing she doesnt have to marry the smug gentleman her family selected; she can head out to sea and open a trade route to China instead. These films not radical-minded indies but among the most expensive and popular onscreen suggest that reality is so fraught and problematic that we need to go elsewhere--out of this world or deep into our minds--to see things clearly. They evoke a Wizard of Oz parallel dimension (""Youre not in Kansas anymore youre on Pandora"" the villainous colonel in Avatar warns) but their lessons are more political than ""Theres no place like home."" Cobb is hired by a businessman (Ken Watanabe) to plant a thought in the brain of a rival (Cillian Murphy). The new idea the rival must break up the conglomerate he is about to inherit which is poised to control half the worlds energy and become as one character puts it ""a new superpower."" A too-powerful energy company? Nolans astute and prescient observation seems like eyes-open common sense in these BP-weary days. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week As his plot mirrors world events Nolan also gives his story an old-school human heart. Cobbs personal mission is to clear his name of a crime so he can stop racing around visually stunning locations (Paris Tokyo Tangiers) and return to his children in Los Angeles. The sci-fi gloss and gizmos are not the point. A machine in Inception lets its characters share dreams and Avatar suspends humans in pod-beds while their brains inhabit Navi bodies but Victorian Alice simply tumbles down a rabbit hole to the same effect to be set loose in the free-floating land of the unconscious and come back improved. Putting on armor and slaying the Jabberwocky lets Alice return to her reality ready to claim her independence and power.On the most superficial level these alt-universes offer audiences the appeal of an easy fix; maybe we can dream our troubles away just as Avatars Jake and Losts Locke can leave their wheelchairs behind and walk on Pandora and the island. More specifically Avatar places its hope in science and ethics Lost offers loosey-goosey spirituality and Alice a familiar proto-feminism. Inception looks for solutions in the tougher realm of the unconscious. Yes thats dizzying. Ellen Page as the architect on Cobbs team is saddled with thankless dialogue like ""Wait whose subconscious are we going into exactly?"" (A sure laugh line.) But the complications are also a measure of Nolans daring and his career-long obsession with control. Mementos hero with acute short-term memory loss tries to hang on to fleeting thoughts; Batman tames the chaos of Gotham. Raising those stakes the characters in Inception try to control what is by nature uncontrollable the unconscious. Its odd that a movie about disciplining thoughts is so over-the-top undisciplined indulging its set-piece action at the expense of coherence. But at least there are ideas at play here and in the other parallel-world films as they capture a cultural moment.The moment they capture most directly though may drift in from two years ago when these movies were still in the works and the Obama campaign was channeling hope for change and a brighter future. These films may be reminders that even in the face of harsh political reality indulging our imaginations is still the best way to find fresh solutions. Or in a more dismal and timely reading of Inception it might take a brain transplant to solve our energy problems.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

By David Denby Leonardo DiCaprio and Ellen Page in Christopher Nolans new movie.   Credit Illustration by Tom Bachtell Christopher Nolan the British-born director of ""Memento"" and of the two most recent Batman movies appears to believe that if he can do certain things in cinema--especially very complicated things--then he has to do them. But why? To what end? His new movie ""Inception"" is an astonishment an engineering feat and finally a folly. Nolan has devoted his extraordinary talents not to some weighty epic theme or terrific comic idea but to a science-fiction thriller that exploits dreams as a vehicle for doubling and redoubling action sequences. He has been contemplating the movie for ten years and as movie technology changed he must have realized that he could do more and more complex things. He wound up overcooking the idea. Nolan gives us dreams within dreams (people dream that theyre dreaming); he also stages action within different levels of dreaming--deep deeper and deepest with matching physical movements played out at each level--all of it cut together with trombone-heavy music by Hans Zimmer which pounds us into near-deafness if not quite submission. Now and then you may discover that the effort to keep up with the multilevel tumult kills your pleasure in the movie. ""Inception"" is a stunning-looking film that gets lost in fabulous intricacies a movie devoted to its own workings and to little else. The outer shell of the story is an elaborate caper. Leonardo DiCaprio with a full head of golden hair and a touch of goatee plays Cobb an international thief. Not a common thief but an ""extractor"" he puts himself to sleep enters the dreams of another person then rummages around and steals something important that pops out of the sleepers unconscious--an industrial secret say. Saito (Ken Watanabe) the head of an enormous Japanese energy company hires Cobb to go beyond extraction to inception; that is not to steal an idea but to plant one that the dreamer will think is his own. Just like Danny Ocean preparing to crack a safe Cobb assembles a larcenous crew who will enter the marks dreams with him. Theres a dream architect Ariadne (Ellen Page) who can create convincing interior worlds so that the dreamer will think that everything is real. Theres a forger Eames (Tom Hardy) who in the dreams can embody any person known to the dreamer. Theres a chemist Yusuf (Dileep Rao) to drop both the team and the target into deeper layers of sleep with a super-sedative. And theres a kind of dream manager a demanding unimaginative sourpuss named Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) to insure that the fantastic sting comes off. Theres also a wild card. Cobbs dead wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) keeps jumping out of the lower reaches of his mind bearing a knife or a gun and crashing into the created dreams. Cobb is still in love with her and feels guilty about something he did to her. Occasionally he takes a rusty old elevator down to his subconscious and visits her. Cotillard with her amber coloring is ravishing and tear-stained and if you dont pinch yourself too hard you might be convinced that this science-fiction conceit is a modern Orpheus-and-Eurydice story of doomed love complete with visits to the underworld. As it is these scenes are the only humanly involving elements in the movie. The rest is strenuous process. Shaking off his wife problem Cobb leads his fellows into the dreams of a suave executive named Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy) and convinces him that his dying father (Pete Postlethwaite) the ornery head of another giant energy company wants him to break up the firm. This will benefit Saito and also prevent world domination by Fischer (or something of that sort--the point is glossed over). Cobb agrees to attempt inception for one reason Saito has promised to pull some strings that will allow him to return to his two young children in America where he is wanted as a fugitive charged with the crime of killing Mal. Summarizing the movie makes it sound saner than it is. For long stretches youre not sure whether youre in dream or reality which isnt nearly as much fun as Nolan must have imagined it to be. Bizarre oddities which complicate the puzzle but are meaningless in themselves flash by in an instant. The actors trying to suggest familiarity with the task of dream invasion spin off gibberish in the most casual way. Parodies I assume will follow on YouTube. And the theologians of pop culture taking a break from ""The Matrix"" will analyze the over-articulate structure of ""Inception"" for mighty significances. Dreams of course are a fertile subject for moviemakers. Bunuel created dream sequences in the teasing masterpieces ""Belle de Jour"" (1967) and ""The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie"" (1972) but he was not making a hundred-and-sixty-million-dollar thriller. He hardly needed to bother with car chases and gun battles; he was free to give his work the peculiar malign intensity of actual dreams. Bunuel was a surrealist-- Nolan is a literal-minded man. Cobbs intercranial adventures arent like dreams at all--theyre like different kinds of action movies jammed together. Buildings explode or collapse anonymous goons shoot at the dreammakers. Bunuel silently pushed us into reveries and left us alone to enjoy our wonderment but Nolan is working on so many levels of representation at once that he has to lay in pages of dialogue just to explain whats going on. At one point Ariadne asks ""Wait--whose subconscious are we going into exactly?"" and the audience laughs. Its the only moment when Nolan acknowledges the nuttiness of his movie. Nolan has always played games with time and sequence. In his best movie ""Memento"" (2000) Leonard the traumatized hero (Guy Pearce) has lost his short-term memory. Each section of the movie moves further back in time in sympathy with Leonard until all the mysteries tormenting him are revealed. Working in shabby closed spaces Nolan created tense and powerful passages. Then he hit the open air. ""Insomnia"" (2002) a murder story with another haunted hero (Al Pacino) was shot in Alaska and was filled with one ravishing white pale-blue and silver ice field after another. Nolan had developed a taste for grandeur violence and shock. In ""The Dark Knight"" (2008) Batmans flights into the chasms of the nighttime city took your breath away but the movie was perverse almost nihilistic in its indifference to story logic. The Nolan who revelled in stunning imagery was becoming a magical manipulator--something that he celebrated in ""The Prestige"" (2006) which turned prestidigitation into an end in itself. ""Inception"" is nominally humanist in its sentiments but you cant help feeling that for Nolan character quirks are just fungible elements in a comprehensive visual scheme. Working with the cinematographer Wally Pfister Nolan does pull off some classic sequences in ""Inception."" When Cobb is teaching Ariadne what to do he takes her into a dream (she thinks its reality) and as they sit in a Paris cafe the city begins popping and exploding around them--the brioches fly through the air in taunting slow motion. Later Cobb lifts an entire Paris neighborhood like a drawbridge and he and Ariadne reaching the hinge where the streets turn upward walk on the perpendicular right into the next arrondissement. Nolan uses C.G.I. freely but some of the most crazily beautiful things are achieved without it. At the climax of the movie a van carrying dreamers falls off a bridge in a prolonged slow-motion shot while a level down in a deeper dream the same characters in physical imitation float weightlessly in a hotel room. Nolan suspended the actors with invisible wires as Ang Lee did in the magnificent fighting-on-treetops scenes in ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" and the solidity of the floating and falling bodies is oddly moving. Pushed to its limits the human body has a dignity that it loses in computer-generated fantasy. In another sequence linked to the falling van Joseph Gordon-Levitt has a tumbling weightless fight with a thug in a spinning hotel corridor. This may be the giddiest movie moment since Fred Astaire climbed the walls in ""Royal Wedding."" But who cares if Cobb gets back to two kids we dont know? And why would we root for one energy company over another? Theres no spiritual meaning or social resonance to any of this no critique of power in the dream-world struggle between C.E.O.s. It cant be a coincidence that Tony Gilroys ""Duplicity"" (2009) which was also about industrial espionage played time games too. The over-elaboration of narrative devices in both movies suggests that the directors sensed that there was nothing at the heart of their stories to stir the audience. In any case I would like to plant in Christopher Nolans head the thought that he might consider working more simply next time. His way of dodging powerful emotion is beginning to look like a grand-scale version of a puzzle-makers obsession with mazes and tropes.

Leonardo DiCaprio plays a corporate thief who steals secrets from his victims while theyre dreaming in Inception. Photo Melissa Moseley AP Inception 1 / 1 Back to Gallery What in the name of almighty summer blockbusters is Inception? Is it a mind-warping science-fiction epic a rebooted Matrix for Generation Z? A paranoid corporate thriller and one-last-job heist movie? An Odyssey of delayed homecoming? The greatest Philip K. Dick story that Dick never wrote? Or is it a grief-soaked ode to the Freudian subconscious -- a layered labyrinthine meditation on the seduction and impact of dreams? Its all of the above. And Ill tell you what else it is spellbinding. Transporting. Damn-near indescribable. Whats more its only the latest indication that Christopher Nolan might be the slyest narrative tactician making movies today. Anything that can be said about the film (and Ill say some of it in a moment) will likely baffle viewers with a low tolerance for noodle-twisting sci-fi computer-dazzled effects or Leonardo DiCaprio. But dont hold any of that against this extraordinary movie a profoundly strange - and strangely profound - spelunking trip through the cavernous human psyche. Inceptionis Nolans follow-up toThe Dark Knight the Batman movie that was so much more. His newest is a head trip and so much more. It stars DiCaprio as Cobb a corporate thief who specializes in ""extracting"" secrets from the minds of dreaming victims. Then hes hired by a Japanese businessman (Ken Watanabe) to do the opposite - i.e. to plant an idea rather than nick one away. To that end he assembles a dream team to plan and launch his attack Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a pragmatic researcher; Tom Hardy as the ""forger"" a cocky dream-world impersonator; Dileep Rao as the chemist who cooks up super-powered sedatives; and Ellen Page as the ""architect"" a talented rookie whose first try at dream manipulation folds a Paris neighborhood in half (wow). If that sounds weird just you wait; it gets weirder. I havent loved a movie this bonkers since Waking Life Richard Link-laters animated look at nesting dream states or maybe The Fountain Darren Aronofskys rapturous oddity about a heartbroken cancer researcher-cum-conquistador. Nolans screenplay (he wrote and produced as well as directed) spreads beyond the main conceit like ivy fingering a wall moving up and out and down to embrace multiple levels of subconsciousness. His plan is to ""seed"" a viral thought in the well-guarded subliminal depths of a corporate scion (Cillian Murphy) tunneling so far in they need a triple-stacked dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream just to get there. Complicating matters is Cobbs unresolved attachment to his wife who shows up in dreams as a discombobulated Marion Cotillard. (In a lovely nod to Cotillards La Vie En Rose for which she won an Oscar Edith Piaf appears on the soundtrack.) The sum effect is convoluted to say the least but all those fantastical plot twists are realized with surprising clarity persuasive logic - and elemental human pain. Wally Pfister a repeat Nolan collaborator going back to Memento does his usual dark magic behind the camera conjuring a sleek look for shadowy doings. Hans Zimmers fourth score for Nolan is bellowing and brilliant the perfect thudding backdrop to a film that moves from James Bond chase scenes (on skis no less) and zero-G combat maneuvers to the disquieting mental landscape of obsession. ""Dreams - they feel real while were in them right?"" asks Cobb. Yes they do. The same could be said for Inception. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals TechRabbit LG Sale Up to 95% off from 2 + free shipping 3P Military Tactical Oxford 30L Backpack for 12 + free shipping Lenovo Sale Up to 36% off + free shipping Sperry Mens Baitfish Leather Flip Flops for 35 + free shipping Powered by Contests Enter to win concert tickets airfare and hotel More Entertainment News Rolling Stones Lash Out at Donald Trump (Again) Over Song Use Daveed Diggs Renee Elise Goldsberry to Leave Hamilton Broken Social Scene Working on New Album Steve Young of M/A/R/R/S Pump Up the Volume Fame Dead Calvin Harris Taylor Swift Song Co-Write Questions We Still...

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Jul. 15 2010 301PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Inception Directed and written by Christopher Nolan Starring Leonardo DiCaprio Ellen Page Marion Cotillard Classification PG The truism says that watched in the dark on a silver screen the movies are a public form of dreaming and our suspended disbelief is the lever that make them real liberating a smile or a tear freeing us to care. But when the dream of a movie becomes a dream in a movie when a slumbering characters subconscious is entered and the concrete world left behind that lever doesnt work nearly as well. Our eye may be dazzled by the surreal sights but our mind tends to shout in protest ""Stop. This is a cheat. Since the movie has abandoned even the pretense of realism traded in for a realm where everything is possible but nothing is palpable where even a fired gun lacks any true consequence then Ive lost any reason to believe and with it any motive to care. If the dreamer feels nothing neither do I."" Succinct for once Henry James put it more bluntly ""Tell a dream kill a story."" Then again ol Henry wasnt much of a filmgoer and Im guessing never saw a single flick by Christopher Nolan a writer-director who loves nothing better than to play mind games with the audience. He did it in Memento and again in The Prestige and hes back at it with a big-budget vengeance in the dreamscape of Inception a.k.a. the most hotly anticipated picture of the year and a bona fide masterpiece just waiting to be unveiled. That at least was the dreamy buzz. The reality? Pretty good not bad but brilliant it surely aint. Awfully clever though - the script takes an excessive but forgivable pride in its cleverness. Apparently its set at some point in the future because technology allows ""extractors"" to sneak into a mans dreams and steal good ideas from his teeming cranium. The obvious contrast with the present when technology merely allows bad ideas to be tweeted endlessly and gratis from empty craniums is unremarked upon. Anyway Dom Cobb (all the names here have a slightly off-kilter sound) is one such extractor a master thief in the corporate sector. Indeed the opening frames find him (Leonardo DiCaprio in intense mode) sharing someones sleeping visions which as luck would have it bear an uncanny resemblance to an action flick - bullets fly cars chase at least until cold water is literally poured over the proceedings. He awakens were confused but not to worry. Inducing a state of confusion the blurring of boundaries is Nolans primary and ongoing goal. The complications thicken with two quick twists from the plot (1) Turns out that Cobb has buried his late wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) deep in his own dark subconscious from which she regularly emerges clad in a fetching black gown to assume the role of femme fatale; and (2) Promising to expunge his criminal record a rich businessman (Ken Watanabe) proposes that Cobb upgrade from extraction to inception not swiping good ideas but planting bad ones in this case in the mind of a major corporate rival (Cillian Murphy). Well such mental horticulture requires quite the team of gardeners - theres Ariadne the ""dreamscape architect"" (Ellen Page); theres Yusuf the chemist (Dileep Rao); theres Arthur the comic relief (Joseph Gordon-Levitt); and theres Eames the macho hunk (Tom Hardy) and the dispenser of an especially precious nugget of wisdom ""You need the simplest version of the idea for it to grow organically in the mind."" For the rest of this Byzantine scenario the irony screams out Nolan is smart enough to write that advice but alas not to take it. How Byzantine does it get? By my watch two hours and umpteen minutes worth devoted to globe-trotting far and wide as blockbusters are wont to do but also spent tumbling down cortical rabbit-holes into various and sundry ids. En route some of the sights are breathtaking. That architectural Ariadne conjures up a delicious visit to Paris where the City of Light seems to fold in on itself like a hinged jewel box as if embracing its own beauty. On the nightmare side of the equation a freight train rumbles down Fifth Avenue a steel elevator opens onto a trashed hotel room ocean waves break over listing skyscrapers. Here a Daliesque tableau there an Escher maze - at best the effects are truly special our eyes truly dazzled. But thats where the truth and any emotional response to it stops. The rest is a murky stream of sub-consciousness as our dream team attaches itself to ""the mark"" and pulls everyone down on a three-tiered descent - yes a dream within a dream within a dream one in a careening white van another in a corridor bereft of gravity the last in a fortress of solitude atop a snow-capped mountain. In each action abounds although much of it just seems grafted on. Occasionally the mania pauses for interludes of chatty exposition including a colloquy informing us that dreamers in this particular dream world dont awaken when they die but are doomed to an eternity in limbo. Yikes. Its like watching a movie and having a catechism class break out. Im being harsh. Theres definitely fun to be had and suspense to be enjoyed exactly where Nolan intends it - in navigating the neurons trying to locate the characters (and ourselves) amidst all the complex circuitry. Of course playing such plot-driven characters gives the actors scant room to manoeuvre. They do the little thats possible within a script that does too much thats so visionary in its cleverness and yet so blind to the big fat problem that wont go away - you cant feel for anyone when nothing feels real.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Meet Christopher Nolan master builder. Writer-director of ""Inception"" (and notably ""Dark Knight"" and ""Memento"" before that) Nolan embodies two roles that figure vitally in the narrative of his astounding genre-defying film He is both architect and dreamer. ""Inception"" is a boldly constructed wonder with plenty of -- as one character describes it -- ""paradoxical architecture."" It is a mouth-agape eyes-wide-open whip-smart ride. Better it is an exhilarating essay on the lure the power the seductions of cinema. You know the dream factory. Leonardo DiCaprio portrays Dom Cobb leader of a team of corporate spies who ply their trade in the subconscious where the deepest secrets are locked. Cobb is a master of ""extraction."" Forget hacking into a companys firewalled servers. The mind is the new target. Did we mention Cobb is vexed by secrets and memories of his own? Did we really need to? The title refers to attempts not to steal an idea but to plant one -- and plant it so deeply in someones subconscious that he believes it to be his own. Its a bold maneuver yet to be achieved. Or has it already? The films start is disorienting. Nolan helps audiences find their bearings all in good artfully paced time. Cobb washes up in a foamy surf and is dragged to a bunker where he comes face to face with an aged man. They have an inscrutable conversation. Then there is a flashback in which the story unfolds again and again. As in many a heist flick Cobb has an opportunity to get out of the biz if only he and his able crew can pull off one last high-risk job. Cobbs employer is Saito (Ken Wata- nabe). His team includes right-hand man Arthur (a deadpan Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and his opposite in attitude Eames (Tom Hardy with a terrifically charismatic tug). Ariadne (Ellen Page) and Yusuf (Dileep Rao) are the new recruits to the team. Shes a preternaturally gifted architect whose name says it all. Hes a skilled chemist of sleep-inducing concoctions. Cillian Murphy does nice work as Robert Fisher Jr. the wounded heir of a dying and exacting magnate. Tom Berenger portrays his uncle. Marion Cotillard appears as Cobbs wife Mal. The simple emotions that grip us most tenaciously -- grief regret the hankering for home -- fuel the deftly paced action. But ""Inception"" is also a philosophical feat. Inspired special effects advance graduate-school-level ruminations about doubt certainty paranoia and trust. And then there is the matter of ""cinema"" itself. Like its spectacular final act ""Inception"" operates on so many levels brilliantly. There are moments when the soft- spoken Mal is actually horror-movie spooky. But make no mistake her presence speaks to a beloved -- bygone? -- cinema. She is a starlet. Cotillards large eyes are made for the go-to shot of the Golden Era the close-up. Mal is the star of Cobbs life. While the acting is better than sturdy it is not where the films genius lies. This deep into his career no one can doubt DiCaprios seriousness of purpose. ""The Aviator"" ""Blood Diamond"" ""The Departed"" and ""Shutter Island"" (as well as his high-profile producers role in the climate- change documentary ""The 11th Hour"") attest to the actors earnest reach. But anguish gets you only so far. Think back to the two roles that made DiCaprio a talent to watch. There was joy in Arnie Grape. There was an affirming smirk to Jack Dawson. One reason ""Inception"" is a far better picture than ""Shutter Island"" -- which it resembles not least because of DiCaprios furrow-browed presence -- is that here theres a winning ensemble gathered to lighten the load. There also are Nolans clever gentle winks. While not quite as magical as Fred Astaires dancing on the walls and ceiling in ""Royal Wedding"" Arthurs maneuvering of a zero-gravity hallway with time ticking away comes mighty close. The repeated use of Edith Piafs ""Non Je Ne Regrette Rien"" amuses. After all Cotillard won the Academy Award for her portrayal of ""the little sparrow"" in ""La Vie En Rose."" A similar nod comes as the story introduces the idea of how important ""the father"" is in how the subconscious constructs its stony bunkers. The role of the Fisher patriarch is played by Pete Postle thwaite (nominated for his turn as father to Daniel Day-Lewis prisoner in ""In the Name of the Father""). Unlike too many action movies ""Inception"" doesnt delight in global destruction. It wields the power of special effects as metaphor. A metropolis folds in on itself like a box. Temblors explosions even gunplay signify psychic roilings the giving way of a dream as the dreamers rattle toward consciousness. Of course the movies central conceit -- about how wholly individual inspiration or a really good idea is -- is a matter for debate. But that Warner Bros. wagered big on a movie that encourages us to ponder things Cartesian Jungian and Freudian is cause for bubbly. This movies heart and intellect make a formidable tag team. Over weeks months arguably years names will be dropped movie titles repeated as critics and fans wrestle with the importance of ""Inception"" Stanley Kubricks ""2001"" the Wachowski siblings ""Matrix"" (the good original) Nolans own ""Memento."" ""Inception"" runs about 2 1/2 hours. Two hours in I looked at my watch. It was not a gesture of boredom but an expression of regret that the ride would soon end. ""INCEPTION.""

Consider the moviegoing experience We enter a theater embrace the darkness and sit rapt as fantasies unfold on the big screen. At this point were sharing the fruits of a new world springing from the filmmakers subconscious.Inception takes this idea to heady often exhilarating extremes. Were not just exploring dreams here; were plumbing dreams within dreams within dreams in a world that seems to be making up its rules as it races along - much like a dream. Writer-director Christopher Nolan showed his love for the cinematic head trip 10 years ago with Memento  a modest-sized film about a man who cant create new memories. But the big-budget Inception is after far bigger fish. Some movies have dream sequences; Inception is content to sprinkle in a few waking sequences.You can tell youre on rapidly shifting ground from the start when two well-dressed agents (Leonardo DiCaprio and Joseph Gordon-Levitt) appear to be shaking down a Japanese businessman (Ken Watanabe) for - what exactly? Before we get an answer a series of edits whisks us into a controlled scrambling of time and space that persists for much of the next 150 minutes. It seems these agents make a living by sharing and entering dreams where they extract and plant ideas and information from and in the minds of their marks. (Ah fictional technology). This mark as it turns out is auditioning Cobb (DiCaprio) and Arthur (Gordon-Levitt) for an epic metaphysical caper Break into the subconscious of a wealthy business heir (Cillian Murphy) and get him to dissolve his late fathers company. At this point the idea of plot summary becomes absurd at least in this given space. Inception is one of those movie experiences that lifts you off the ground and throttles your sense of stability; when the lights go up you may feel a little punch drunk as you look for your feet on the floor. Nolan specializes in this feeling and here he utilizes every ounce of his craft (and an extremely gifted crew) to deliver his own answer to The Matrix.Inception can be baffling and silly as shards of information fly at you at every turn the expository substance of a movie that throws you headfirst into its intricate premise. But it can also be sublime and I found myself admiring the movies stubborn adherence to its own universe and logic. This dream team which also includes a dream architect (Ellen Page) a dream chemist (Dileep Rao) and a dream forger (Tom Hardy) end up operating simultaneously on multiple planes of consciousness including a rainy Los Angeles with a freight train barreling through downtown streets and a snow-covered mountain range stocked with bad guys on skis (protectors of the marks subconscious). Among the movies charms (or demerits if you choose to look at it that way) These brainy sidekicks have no trouble becoming action heroes in the world of dreams.Inception is definitely an action movie stocked with improbable shootouts and tire-screeching chase scenes. It should be noted that each task at hand isnt designed for the efficacy of getting in and getting the job so much as the maximum impact of movie excitement. After all if Pages dream designer were after simplicity we wouldnt have much of a film on our hands. At times Inception feels like a high-concept James Bond adventure; the automatic-weapon skiing sequence feels particularly ridiculous unless youve been longing for a blast of The Spy Who Loved Me.Inception has an ace in the hole a tragic romance with lush existential angles. From the start a mysterious brunette (Marion Cotillard) weaves in and out of Cobbs dream space like a beautiful specter ready to wreak uninvited havoc on the best-laid plans. This figure from the past is Cobbs addiction the embodiment of his paradise lost and as we learn more and more and enter into the physical projection of his not-so-private torment the relationship gives Inception unexpected emotional resonance.The craft level is sky-high. Standouts include Hans Zimmers pulsating score which finds the right tone for every lightning shift in the narrative and Wally Pfisters cinematography which adds its own epic dimension to the CGI-intensive layering of universes. DiCaprio deserves mention as well. As in Shutter Island another recent movie that rattles around in the mind for a while he provides an emotional anchor and a touch of gravitas to an affair that walks a fine line between the daring and the unhinged.The ideas and images are the real stars here. Even when theyre not entirely baked they challenge you to question notions of reality and representation. They leave you fumbling for a place to stand. They make the outside world look and feel like a different place when you emerge from the dark.Director Christopher NolanStarring Leonardo DiCaprio Ellen Page Joseph Gordon-Levitt Tom Hardy Ken Watanabe Marion Cotillard Dileep Rao and Tom BerengerRun time 148 minutesMPAA rating PG-13 (sequences of violence and action throughout) editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

By Peter Rainer Film critic July 15 2010 Save for later Saved Leonardo DiCaprio plays an espionage expert in the new movie Inception. Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Writer-director Christopher Nolans ""Inception"" is about an espionage expert Leonardo DiCaprios Dom Cobb who has a highly specialized way of stealing corporate secrets He extracts them from within the dreams of his targets.Depending on your taste for narrative logic Nolans penchant for delineating dream states carries either a built-in advantage or a huge liability. If you dont mind being tossed about in a state of high confusion for 2-1/2 hours as dreams enfold within dreams and subconscious states are poised in an infinite limbo then this is your dream movie.I found myself more inclined to sympathize with Cobbs notion that in limbo states hours can turn into years. After one too many dreams-within-dreams-within-dreams I was feeling in limbo myself. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Which is not to say that ""Inception"" isnt a compelling thrill ride. Its just not much of a fun ride. Nolan best known for his ""Batman"" movies and the time-shifty ""Memento"" is very big on noir. For him black is beautiful - i.e. horrible. When Cobb starts hunting dream worlds he never encounters anything transcendent inside anybodys noggin. The darkness of this movie as was also the case with Nolans ""Dark Knight"" is magisterially oppressive. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Cobbs situation despite its newfangled presentation is fairly conventional even sappy. Once upon a time he became a fugitive from America for supposedly causing the death of his wife Mal (Marion Cotillard who coming after Michael Manns ""Public Enemies"" is Hollywoods designated noir vamp). Mal keeps invading his dreams or the dreams he concocts within others dreams-within-dreams or their dreams within his dreams or - oh forget it. Anyway shes up to no good even though technically shes dead or in limbo or something.The point is man-with-a-past Cobb is still in love with her. She is literally the woman of his dreams. His enraptured state is scaled big Wagnerian big but neither he nor Mal can quite fill out the ardor. Thats because Nolan ultimately is a head guy and not a heart guy. Hes all about architecture. Everything in this movie issues from the heavy doominess of its look.Things lighten up ever so slightly when Cobb hired by a Japanese tycoon (Ken Watanabe) to do some heavy-duty extraction - excuse me inception - on a corporate heir (Cillian Murphy) assembles his A-Team of fellow dream foragers including Ellen Pages Ariadne master forger Eames (Tom Hardy) and sidekick-researcher Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).But even here Cobb too often spoils the party by offering up such deep-think pronouncements as ""we only use a fraction of our brains true potential."" I cite this line which is typical - not to mention unoriginal and probably untrue - because many people are going to be conned into thinking ""Inception"" is some sort of high-I.Q. whirligig just because its festooned with Mobius strips and M.C. Escher stairs and everybody in it seems to understand whats going on even if you dont. (The biggest the only laugh line at my screening came at a particularly confusing time when Ariadne suddenly asks ""Whose subconscious did we just go into?"")For movie buffs the only real fun to be had at ""Inception"" could be toting up the lifts from other movies including Cocteaus ""Blood of a Poet"" and ""The Matrix"" series and just about anything by Kubrick. (One movie not referenced is Joseph Rubens terrific ""Dreamscape"" from 1984 which had a lot more fun with some of the same concepts.) Nolan like Cobb is an assiduous extractor and he knows how to wow audiences. But scaling big and thinking big are not the same thing. And dark just because its dark isnt more artistic than light.Its artier though. Grade B (Rated PG-13 for sequences of violence and action throughout.)RELATED The Sorcerers Apprentice movie review Restrepo movie review Recent Movie Reviews Star Trek Beyond is consistently entertaining Norman Lear Just Another Version of You is a testimonial to an icon The Innocents The subject of the film is more arresting than the movie Print/Reprints About these ads Sponsored Content by LockerDome About these ads About these ads We want to hear did we miss an angle we should have covered?

He is awakened by armed guards and delirious speaks a name to them. The guards take him to a palatial home where he meets the bearer of that name a man grown rich and wrinkled with the passage of years. The old man asks him ""Are you here to kill me?"" This might easily have been the opening of an austere hypnotic noir Raymond Chandler by way of Paul Bowles. Instead it is the opening of the summers most mind-bending action entertainment Christopher Nolans Inception. And if the early reviews are any indication I may be very nearly alone in my disappointment. First the good news of which there is plenty. Inception Nolans first picture since The Dark Knight put him in the billion-dollar-movie club is a sharp and intricate diversion and easily the summers best blockbuster to date. (Yes this may accurately be deemed faint praise; no its not intended as damnation.) Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Dom Cobb who may sound like a salad but has the look and disposition of a lean slice of beef. Cobb is a thief of the subconscious the best in the world at the art of ""extraction"" or breaking and entering the dreams of the powerful in order to purloin their secrets. His first target in the film is Saito (Ken Watanabe) an energy industrialist whose competitors would like to get a look under his hood. Though the mission fails Saito is impressed enough by Cobbs effort that he offers to forgive the trespass--provided of course that Cobb perform him a service in return. What Saito demands however is a more delicate operation than the psychic burglary in which Cobb typically specializes rather than pilfer an idea from the subconscious of his corporate adversary Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy) Saito contracts Cobb to implant one. (Hence ""inception."") Befitting any proper heist movie Cobbs mission begins with the assembly of a team. (Lest we be caught unprepared Saito commands ""Assemble a team."") Cobb dutifully rounds up Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) the right-hand man; Eames (Tom Hardy) the ""forger"" able to impersonate the dreamers trusted friends and allies; Ariadne (Ellen Page) the architecture student tasked with designing the dreamscapes in which the operation will take place; and Yusuf (Dileep Rao) the sedative specialist responsible for making sure no one wakes up before the mission is complete. The job itself is to take place on three levels of escalating subliminality a dream within a dream within a dream each meticulously designed to lower their subjects resistance to the suggestion they seek to embed. The requisite complications ensue. Among them is the belated discovery that Fischers subconscious has been ""militarized""--that is trained to repel psychic invasion--with the upshot that Cobb et al. spend the latter half of the film being shot at by dreamworld security. (Envision The Matrixs Agent Smith minus the sneer and sunglasses.) Worse the team is haunted with intensifying animosity by Cobbs dead wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) whose guilt-ridden memory (backstory alert) he cannot--and perhaps does not wish to--leave behind. Nolans film overflows with narrative ingenuity and cinematic showmanship. Snatches of dialogue recur their meanings refracted through levels of reality and unreality. Gordon-Levitt tousles with henchmen in a rotating hotel hallway putting to shame his own anti-gravity acrobatics on SNL. Allusions to Penrose stairs rub elbows with canny wordplay (e.g. ""Mal"" whose name conjures both ""moll"" and the French term for her predisposition). Four concurrent climaxes are piled one atop another on interdependent dream layers. And perhaps most impressive Nolan assembles the kaleidoscopic elements into a nearly seamless whole and buffs it all to an immaculate polish. Quibbles can be found for those inclined to look. It is quickly evident to viewers though somehow not to his teammates that Cobbs deep psychic scars make him perhaps the least reliable dreamcrasher imaginable. (It can hardly be a good sign that around the two-hour mark Cobb confesses ""Theres something you should know about me--about inception."") And bravura editing notwithstanding the four-headed finale tends to undercut the impact of each of its components. Its one thing to marvel at a master juggler but rather another to feel as if you are one of the balls. In the end it may be Inceptions greatest strength its precision engineering that also proves its signal weakness. Nolan has always been a nimble meticulous director but his best work has exceeded such technical virtues. His first major film Memento may have taken the form of a gimmick movie but it transcended its own structural ingenuity to become one of the most unique and resonant tragedies of the past 25 years. His last movie The Dark Knight was also his messiest with flaws that included a collapsing final act. Yet it too perhaps in part thanks to that messiness found unexpected grandeur and gravity in its subject. For all its elegant construction Inception is a film in which nothing feels comparably at stake. (In this it resembles Nolans The Prestige another admirably heady tale of perception and reality that never quite found a hearty emotional grip.) The dangers that loom with the failure of Cobbs mission range from the inconsequential (Saitos firm goes out of business) to the inauthentic (Cobb wont be able to return to pretty talismanic children he was forced to abandon parenthood as MacGuffin). The sorrow of Cobb and Mals doomed marriage too for all of Cotillards hypnotic allure feels nonetheless remote a motivation in search of real meaning. Though questions may linger at the films conclusion they are less likely to be moral than mechanical How many minutes of dream-time comprise a minute of waking life? How again did the heroes wake themselves up from their ultimate dream? Like his protagonist Nolan excels as an implanter of subversive ideas. This time alas he didnt dig quite deep enough for them to take root.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history.

In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed.

She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s.

Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

"Inceptions dream team weaves a mesmerizing tale washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On >> This StoryRead +| Comments MOVIE REVIEW Inceptions dream team weaves a mesmerizing tale Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday July 15 2010 ""Inception"" the science fiction thriller by writer-director Christopher Nolan that easily qualifies as the most highly anticipated movie of the summer opens with a dramatic shot of huge waves breaking onto a nameless shore. And that image suggests the best way to watch a film with such a tightly coiled plot cerebral conceits and formidable ambition. Rather than trying to game out ""Inception"" on first viewing its best to let it wash over you and save the head-scratching and inevitable Talmudic interpretations for later. This StoryMOVIE REVIEW Minds-eye-catcherWatch Inception trailer Chances are there will be a later ""Inception"" is the kind of film that will no doubt drive scores of viewers to theaters for a second go. But the key to success in a movie as purposefully complex as this one is that you see it again not because you have to but because you want to. ""Inception"" is that rare film that can be enjoyed on superficial and progressively deeper levels a feat that uncannily mimics the mind-bending journey its protagonist takes. That would be Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) who makes his living navigating the minds of other people sharing their dreams and stealing ideas in an elaborate psychological gambit known as ""extraction."" Along with his henchman Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and a vaguely sinister sleep-inducing gadget Cobb has worked mostly with businesses engaged in super-complicated corporate espionage. But as ""Inception"" opens a client named Saito (Ken Watanabe) hires Cobb for an altogether different assignment Rather than steal an idea he wants Cobb and Arthur to plant one in the mind of Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy) the would-be heir to an energy conglomerate in a process called ""inception."" Its a tough job and Cobb proceeds to assemble a crack team of dream-weavers to help him pull it off including a wily forger named Eames (Tom Hardy) a chemist named Yusuf (Dileep Rao) and a young architect named Ariadne (Ellen Page) who in addition to designing the mazelike dreamscapes much of ""Inception"" transpires in acts as an essential proxy for filmgoers who are likely to find themselves utterly lost in the directors own convoluted ideas. Nolan has always been prone to making hermetic self-serious movies from his 2000 breakthrough film ""Memento"" to ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight."" But he lets a little more air into ""Inception"" in the form of an occasional joke and an essentially popcorn-movie premise. Indeed ""Inception"" often plays like the coolest ""Oceans Eleven"" installment ever made albeit with a fewer wisecracks and a much trippier caper. Luckily the cast strikes just the right tone for the enterprise. DiCaprio and Page bring quiet focus to roles that would have been scuttled by showboating. Hardy who delivered as astonishing turn in last years ""Bronson"" provides most of the films welcome comic relief needling Gordon-Levitt with deadpan economy as the heist just gets weirder. To its credit ""Inception"" plays equally well on an entirely different plane namely the kind of twisty mind-game that suggests the work of Charlie Kaufman (""Adaptation"") and the ""Matrix"" movies. As Cobb crafts and executes his scheme issues surface involving a beautiful woman named Mal (Marion Cotillard) whose name is pronounced ""moll"" and whose smoky seductive beauty indeed suggests a classic femme fatale of yore. As with Kaufmans ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" the extravagant backdrops and set pieces of ""Inception"" as often as not become metaphors for Cobb and Mals own unreliable relationship. And make no mistake those set pieces are dazzling from ""Inceptions"" opening scenes -- shifting seamlessly from a Japanese fortress to a war zone to a Paris street that suddenly folds in on itself -- to its endgame set within a frenetic chase through a rainy Los Angeles street a sleek five-star hotel and a massive snowbound mountain redoubt. Nolan who reportedly used as few computer effects as possible while shooting ""Inception"" spares no detail for a movie in which there are no accidents even in the most irrational non sequiturs. (For all its consummate visual style ""Inception"" also boasts an astute sound design Listen for the leitmotif of a ticking stopwatch echoed by a passing bicycle and in Hans Zimmers powerful score.) Drawing as much inspiration from Mies van der Rohe and Le Corbusier as he does from M.C. Escher Nolan nonetheless manages to create a world all his own in ""Inception."" And thats a world that while clearly a product of an auteurs idiosyncratic impulses meets viewers at precisely that liminal state between dream and reality where movies work best. Nolan exemplifies the best kind of filmmaking unchained from the laws of time space and even gravity but never from the most basic rules of narrative. Even at its most tangled and paradoxical ""Inception"" keeps circling back to the motivation that has driven films from ""The Wizard of Oz"" to ""E.T."" Cobb finally just wants to go home. This aim in its simplicity manages to make comprehensible even the most preposterous layers-upon-layers of ""Inception"" and gives what could easily have been a chilly impenetrable exercise a surprisingly strong emotional core. At its most audacious and enterprising ""Inception"" provides just the kind of fully imagined escapism that adventurous filmgoers wish movies aspired to more often. But its the storys most recognizable human struggles -- to let go forgive and move on -- that make ""Inception"" worth puzzling over long after its most transporting sensations have washed away. Inception  1/2 (148 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for sequences of violence and action throughout. >> This StoryRead +| Comments (c) 2010 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  Minds-eye-catcher Watch Inception trailer",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/14/AR2010071405236.html,200,inception11,inception,washingtonpost

Warner Bros By John Anderson Updated July 16 2010 1201 a.m. ET Call it the Emperors New Bedclothes ""Inception"" the first feature from director Christopher Nolan since his enormously successful ""The Dark Knight"" is a movie about dreams and alas one that may well merit the appellation ""critic proof."" Ordinarily this term applies to films that advance a popular series (""Harry Potter"" ""Twilight"") or which boast stars so enormous they cant be deterred by conventional weapons. ""Inception"" isnt either of these things. And yet it may still be impervious to criticism simply because no one short of a NASA systems analyst will be able to articulate the plot. Watch a movie clip from Christopher Nolans sci-fi thriller ""Inception."" But lets try. The deeply troubled Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) provides a unique service for his corporate clients stealing secrets from the subconscious of their competition. As will become clear Cobb cannot return to the U.S. because something happened to his wife the aptly named Mal (Marion Cotillard) who may be dead or may be alive but either way travels through Cobbs dreamlife wreaking havoc. When the Japanese industrial magnate Saito (Ken Watanabe) asks Cobb to plant an idea in the mind of his rival Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy) its an offer Cobb cant really refuse If he can manipulate Fischer into breaking up the company of his soon-to-be-late father (Pete Postlethwaite) it will derail the creation of the worlds only energy superpower. And a grateful Saito will get Cobb back home to the U.S. and his longed-for children. How? Never mind that. The real question is Where? In an effort to give his imagist impulses the broadest possible canvas Mr. Nolan has scripted a story that travels across six countries and just as many layers of human consciousness. The problem is we dont know where we are most of the time. And we profoundly do not care. See a trailer from the new film Inception starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Dreams and movies have a kinship as old as cinema itself. As soon as filmmakers learned about double-exposure souls started leaving bodies; subconscious fears became flesh; the biggest bad guys were bonked on the head if only in a poor tramps fantasies. Both dreams and movies provide an alternate reality a visual adventure full of unpredictable and sometimes Freudian implications. But ""Inception"" reneges on the implicit deal By convoluting the various planes of experience by overlapping and obscuring ostensible realities and ostensible dreams Mr. Nolan deprives us the opportunity of investing emotionally in any of it. Read More Studios Root for Inception Speakeasy How Special Effects Helped Joseph Gordon-Levitt Fly Speakeasy Inception Co-star Tom Berenger Didnt Understand Plot Either He is not it seems a conventional narrative storyteller. Thats OK--neither is David Lynch or a lot of other artists of cinema who are more concerned with the subliminal suggestive powers of film. But ""Inception"" isnt an experimental movie and it requires too much explanation more than Mr. Nolan can gracefully dole out. His breakthrough feature ""Memento"" certainly was a novel intriguing construct with plotlines moving backwards and forwards like rows of ducks at a mental shooting gallery. But the sometimes hallucinatory images erupting out of the narrative murk of ""Inception"" suggest that the entire enterprise was contrived as an alibi for special-effects wizardry--and that what Mr. Nolan had in ""The Dark Knight"" was the perfect match for his talents Namely a built-in mythology. Mr. Nolan could embellish the Batman legend in the most fantastical and visceral ways and never lose his audience because they already knew very well who was who and what was what. ENLARGE Leonardo DiCaprio in another scene from the film. Warner Bros. It may be that Mr. Nolan is purposely making his story obscure so as not to distract from his phenomenal image-making. If so its a waste of costly man hours. Mr. DiCaprio it should be said is a wonderful actor as well as an engaging screen presence but his choices of late seem as suspect as ""Inception."" (The mysterious wife the ephemeral kids the fractured realities here all recall the recent ""Shutter Island."") Hes also as hampered as everyone else in the cast needless to say by the script. Each question asked by Cobbs dream team--Ariadne (Ellen Page) Eames (Tom Hardy) Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt)--is answered a la the official ""Inception"" owners manual quickly predictably and as if it were all being made up on the fly. There is indeed an answer for everything The sedative that doesnt allow a dreamer to return from the dream? Ive adjusted it says the team pharmacologist (Dileep Rao). What happens if someone is killed in dream but is sedated at the same time? Uh he goes to Limbo or ""unconstructed dream space."" They dont wink at each quite although when Ariadne asks late in the game ""Whose subconscious are we going into exactly?"" it may be the biggest laugh line of the summer movie season. Winnebago Man Anyone familiar with the back story of ""Winnebago Man"" would likely expect a movie that furthers the now-commonplace schadenfreude-based entertainment of airwaves and tabloids In 1989 ex-CBS newsman Jack Rebney was trying to produce a series of industrial films for Winnebago motor-home dealers and having a profoundly difficult time. It was Iowa it was summer; there was heat there were flies. Mr. Rebney couldnt remember his lines. His explosive and apparently frequent outbursts ripe with expletives were maliciously edited into a kind of Jacks Greatest Hits that for years made its way hand-to-hand on VHS tape--until 2005 when YouTube was launched at which point Mr. Rebney went viral. Like various other YouTube ""stars""--the ""Star Wars Kid"" who wound up in a psychiatric hospital or the ""Chocolate Rain"" singer or the ""Worlds Worst Woman Driver"" (who flips her car while pulling into her driveway)--Mr. Rebney joined the Online Hall of Ridicule Derision and Ignominy. ENLARGE Jack Rebney in one of many moments of frustration in Winnebago Man. Kino International Or did he? In first-time director Ben Steinbauers joyous excavation of the now elderly and nearly blind Mr. Rebney Mr. Steinbauer acknowledges the gleefully poisonous nature of the YouTube culture and his own complicity in it As media expert Douglas Rushkoff puts it the director is assuming our ""collective cultural guilt"" by setting out to find out where Mr. Rebney is and what happened to him in the 20 years since Winnebago. What Mr. Steinbauer does find is an irascible character with decided opinions who doesnt give a hoot about YouTube but plays along with Mr. Steinbauer for the off-chance of being allowed to bash Dick Cheney on camera. Read More Speakeasy Did Jack Rebney Inspire Curb Your Enthusiasm? That Mr. Rebney is a real character comes as no surprise. Whats odd given Mr. Steinbauers obvious intelligence is the directors blinkered view of his subject. For much of the film Mr. Steinbauer tries to shoehorn Mr. Rebney into his ""worlds angriest man"" role and make the movie he wants to make. And he thus misses Mr. Rebneys redemptive power As hilarious as he might have been in those old Winnebago outtakes Mr. Rebney was always angriest at himself. He couldnt have been an easy man to work with. But his frustration was with his own inadequacies as both pitchman and producer. Thats what set him off on his purple tirades. People might have laughed at the old Jack Rebney but they were laughing at themselves as well. And counting their blessings. Everyone has a cranky side. Unlike Mr. Rebneys it isnt usually gawked at by 20 million people. --John Anderson contributes film criticism and coverage to a variety of publications. Joe Morgenstern is on vacation. DVD FOCUS ENLARGE Memento (2000) Immediately upon premiering at the 2000 Venice Film Festival Christopher Nolans breakthrough drama was recognized as something special Based on his brother Jonathans short story it was told in both reverse and chronological order in color vs. black and white and made gripping psychological hay out of a strange strange premise Spurred by the messages tattooed on his body a victim of short-term memory loss (Guy Pearce) hunts down his wifes rapist-killer. It opened everywhere except America where no one wanted to buy it so the production company wound up distributing what would become a very profitable cult favorite. ENLARGE The Prestige (2006) Mr. Nolans follow-up to 2005s ""Batman Begins"" reunited him with Caped Crusader-portrayer Christian Bale as well as Hugh Jackman Michael Caine Scarlett Johansson and David Bowie in a tale of rival magicians and lethal tricks. Mr. Bale gives one of his more intense performances as 19th-century conjurer Alfred Borden who blames his wifes death on his former friend Robert Angier (Jackman); hostilities escalate from on-stage sabotage to matters more lethal. Underrated--perhaps overshadowed by Mr. Nolans Batman efforts--its a complicated well-acted period piece that may have suffered from an awkward title (which refers to a magicians particular chef doeuvre). ENLARGE The Dark Knight (2008) The third-highest domestic moneymaker after ""Avatar"" and ""Titanic"" (and the sixth world-wide) Mr. Nolans structurally ungainly but often exhilarating Batman saga put him in Hollywoods very exclusive Billion Dollar Boys Club and showcased a virtuosic gift for action and effects. Featuring Mr. Bale again as well as Aaron Eckhart Maggie Gyllenhaal Gary Oldman and Michael Caine the saga is perhaps best remembered for Heath Ledgers performance as The Joker which won the actor a posthumous Oscar and helped him steal the movie out from under his formidable cast of co-stars. --John Anderson Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

"Inception | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; inception ) Inception (United States/United Kingdom 2010) July 15 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Undoubtedly some reviews are going to describe Inception as confusing. Such a description confounds me and may be more indicative of how accepting people have become of screenplays that allow for no ambiguity and traverse plotlines by blazing trails that even a blind man could follow. For those who pay attention Inception is not confusing. It is smart taut and does not reward indolence. If you zone out or make a trip to the snack bar it will lose you. All it asks of viewers is that they do something rare engage the intellect. Details may elude even the most attentive viewer but the big picture will remain in focus. Despite layering dream upon dream and blurring the lines between reality and fantasy writer/director Christopher Nolan has meticulously established Inception in such a way that getting lost is not an option. Is it a mind fuck? Maybe but not one that leads to endless frustration. Nolan has a story to tell and he tells it. His main goal - at least until the end - is not screwing with the viewers perception. He provides enough clarity that we know where we are and what were watching and that we dont founder. In fact one could make an argument that the straightforward nature of Nolans approach to such potentially mind-bending material is one of Inceptions weaknesses. By pulling his punches so to speak and keeping things mostly linear Nolan disallows the possibility of the screenplay turning into a Mobius Strip. Influences include most obviously Dark City and The Matrix. Theres also a sense of kinship with Martin Scorseses recent Shutter Island not only because that film also stars Leonardo DiCaprio but because both productions toy with narrator perspective and the intersection of illusion with reality. However the strongest synergy I can think of is with the TV series Caprica (the prequel to Ronald Moores Battlestar Galactica remake) which uses a similar approach to the one employed in Inception to explore virtual realities. Inception unfolds is a near-future setting in which devices have been invented that allow individuals to invade the dreams of others and if theyre clever and experienced enough extract secrets revealed by way of the subjects subconscious. One of the best such thieves is Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) who is being recruited for a job by corporate magnate Saito (Ken Watanabe) after failing in an espionage attempt to steal one of Saitos secrets. At first Cobb isnt interested but then Saito offers a carrot that Cobb cant refuse the opportunity for past crimes to be forgiven - something that would allow him to return to the United States and see his two young children. The nature of Cobbs infractions is not immediately revealed but they involve his wife (Marion Cotillard). What Saito wants is not an ordinary request. Instead of asking for an extraction he demands an inception - the implantation of an idea deep in the subconscious that will bear future results. Most dream thieves consider this impossible but Cobb disagrees because he has done it. Its risky and dangerous but possible. The target is Robert Fischer Jr. (Cillian Murphy) who has just inherited the corporate empire built by his father (Pete Posthelthwaite). Cobb assembles his team beginning with his frequent compatriot Arthur (Joseph-Gordon Levitt). Together they recruit an ""architect"" - the individual who builds the dream worlds. She is Ariadne (Ellen Page) a student studying under the tutelage of Cobbs father-in-law (Michael Caine). After Ariadne undergoes her training (which serves as a tutorial for the audience as well) the final two members are brought on board Eames (Tom Hardy) who can impersonate anyone in a dream and Yusef (Dileep Rao) a chemist whose drugs can keep sleepers sedated or bring them back to wakefulness. Together with Fischer and Saito these five travel into a dream-within-a-dream-within-a dream where three levels deep they attempt the inception. Inception is a less challenging project than Memento which brought Nolan to the worlds attention. It isnt as convoluted and the payoff despite toying with our expectations lacks the boldness of the earlier production. Still this is a very good film that involves the intellect while at the same time not ignoring the visceral. There are numerous straightforward action scenes including Matrix-like gravity-free hand-to-hand combat and a car chase that inject some adrenaline into the proceedings. In fact the entire second half of the film amounts to one massive carefully choreographed sequence of escalating suspense as dangerous circumstances unfold across three levels of dreamscapes. Hans Zimmers pounding score and Nolans careful cross-cutting tie everything together perfectly. As intellectually involving as this material is Nolan wisely does not ignore the need for the viewer to have a strong emotional attachment to the main character. Cobbs backstory unfolds gradually with the screenplay dropping pieces like crumbs in front of the viewer at regular intervals. We learn the truth about his relationship with his wife and children during the course of the narrative and as one might suspect given Nolans apparent anti-happiness bias (his movies arent exactly carefree and joyous) there are tragic elements. Cobb is the only character who experiences significant development - the other members of his team are secondary. They get plenty of screen time but we know little about them beyond their functions within the scheme. Seemingly half of the Batman Begins/The Dark Knight cast is on board for this production Ken Watanabe Cillian Murphy Michael Caine. Of course when working with actors of that caliber its hard to go wrong. Apparently DiCaprio in addition to being Martin Scorseses current day Robert DeNiro was always Nolans first choice for Cobb and the versatile actor brings the full weight of his talent to bear on a difficult role. DiCaprio has to hint at unpleasant secrets in Cobbs past while forging a bond with the audience. Its up to the performer to make Inception more about human beings than about special effects. He succeeds and thats one reason why this movie isnt only about challenging ideas and eye candy. The special effects in Inception serve the story rather than the other way around - which is a rare occurrence these days when the emphasis seems to be on providing viewers with visual amusement park rides. In this case we are presented with cities where streets defy gravity by arching overhead and massive cliffs that collapse into the sea. There is a point to everything most often to illustrate how dreams distort the commonplace into something that defies the natural laws. Is Inception cerebral? Yes. Is it too cerebral for mass audiences? I would argue thats not the case. In a sense one gets out of Inception what one is willing to put in. Those looking for an action/adventure film can identify that although 148 minutes is a little long for something so simplistic. Those willing to think and puzzle a little more will find that the twists and turns of the narrative arent as labyrinthine as they initially appear. Inception is more accessible than obtuse. It proves among other things that Nolan has been unwilling to bask in the success of The Dark Knight. Looking for new and exciting challenges he has found one here.

"Inception (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Inception (PG-13) Director Christopher Nolan goes down the rabbit hole of your mind Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald7/14/2010 Editor rating 3.5 Inception is a movie about dreams - a genre that is usually the cinematic equivalent of a sleeping pill. The film is thick with exposition and explanation Every line spoken by Ellen Page for example sounds as if it came from a technical manual. Long stretches are difficult to comprehend in a single viewing. Most of the characters are thinly sketched defined only by their professions. The picture bears the same emotionally cool - some would say detached - tone of Christopher Nolans previous work (Insomnia Following Memento The Prestige). I absolutely loved every minute of it. Nolan has been breaking the basic rules of filmmaking since the start of his career (who else has dared to make a movie that unfolded backward?) but Inception is even by his standards an audacious feat - a 160 million experiment that is the antithesis of his previous picture the audience-friendly The Dark Knight. The phenomenal success of that movie earned Nolan the opportunity to make Inception which is basically a small art film told on a mammoth scale. Its brilliant marketing campaign which began last summer has succeeded in piquing curiosity mostly through startling images without any explanation of what the movie was about. Theres a reason Any attempt to summarize the plot would result in a rudely prolonged conversation. The basic premise Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Cobb a self-described extractor who can invade peoples dreams and steal their deepest secrets. But the powerful businessman (Ken Watanabe) who hires Cobb and his team wants them not to steal but to plant an idea inside the head of a corporate rival (Cillian Murphy). Genuine inspiration is the hardest thing for an extractor to pull off because the idea has to be buried deep enough so that the target never questions its authenticity. Cobbs teammates say the plan is doomed the assignment impossible because it requires delving too far into the targets subconscious. But Cobb claims he has pulled the trick off before. How and when Cobb achieved that first successful inception is one of the many story points Nolan reveals gradually at just the right moment giving new meaning to everything youve seen before. Inception is the sort of film that requires you to place your trust in the director and assume that the befuddling puzzle before you will eventually make sense. The movie offers too many concepts and grand ideas to absorb easily. This one requires work. If you like it - and not everyone will - you probably will want to see it again. But even just one viewing makes every other action movie released this year look like an episode of Elmos World. Nolan has gotten a lot better at directing large-scale mayhem since Batman Begins in which the action was often incomprehensible. Sequences here such as a car chase interrupted by the sudden appearance of a speeding freight train barreling down a Paris street are so well done they rival prime Spielberg (they also occasionally echo vintage James Bond an obvious inspiration). Inception is filled with grand astonishing sights (in a dream Page folds Paris onto itself as if she were folding a sheet of paper) and small ingenious bits (DiCaprio gets stuck in a narrow alley while running away from bad guys and the claustrophobia is nerve-racking). Nolan pays as much attention to small details as to big ones. The movie is as carefully constructed as a Faberge egg. The last half hour a dream within a dream within a dream is a breathtaking marvel of editing and pacing cutting back and forth among three realms the events in one impacting the others. The effect tickles your mind then blows it right out of your skull. Even during its most complex sequences Inception grips you tightly and the actors although stranded with stick-figure characters give it personality. Marion Cotillard is particularly good as Cobbs wife who has a tendency to show up in dreams to antagonize him (but why?) and DiCaprio playing the films only well-rounded character anchors this giant spectacle with tragic human-sized angst. For all its psychobabble and discussions of ""unconstructed dream space"" Inception can be enjoyed as a caper picture suffused with sci-fi and fantasy. The movie ultimately doesnt resonate with meaning - its not really about anything profound other than the sheer joy of unfettered imagination. But as a piece of grade-A entertainment Inception is a knockout capped off by a final tantalizing image that will undoubtedly be the best closing shot of the year. M.C. Escher Carl Jung and Stanley Kubrick would have loved this movie. Here finally is something youve really never seen before.

(Moseley/Warner Bros.) Elizabeth Weitzman Friday July 16 2010 400 AM Title Inception When was the last time you had your mind blown by a movie? Because when ""Inception"" ends and the lights come up youll be sitting in your seat staring at the screen wondering what the hell just happened.Of course it wont be the first time director Christopher Nolan has shaken us out of the apathy that modern moviegoing induces. ""Inception"" blends the blockbuster enormity of his ""Dark Knight"" with the indie insights of ""Memento"" to create an all-encompassing experience that makes most other summer films seem mediocre.Like ""Memento"" this is one youll need to see several times backwards and forwards to fully grasp. And since part of the fun is Nolans insistence on keeping us unmoored you wont find any spoilers here.But the basics are these Leonardo DiCaprio is Dom Cobb a futuristic thief who specializes in rifling through peoples brains while they dream. Though this is not a job without risks his new assignment is about to raise the stakes.When a mysterious businessman (Ken Watanabe) asks Dom to change- rather than simply steal - the thoughts of a competitor (Cillian Murphy) Doms colleagues (including Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ellen Page) balk. Theyd have to travel deeper into the recesses of their targets subconscious which poses extreme danger for everyone involved. But Dom has been a haunted man since his wife (Marion Cotillard) died and this mission may be his best chance to find some peace.No synopsis could possibly do justice to the complex universe Nolan fashions as we go deeper into each visually ornate emotionally intricate dreamscape. Granted not every element works perfectly; Cotillards storyline feels underdeveloped and the action could have been tightened up. But the ambition on display is so huge and the filmmaking so intelligent youll emerge feeling as if youve just watched an entire season of the greatest sci-fi series never made.With ""Inception"" Nolan acknowledges that no one could create a movie as exciting as unexpected as startling as the dreams we invent for ourselves. But its evident by now that hes never going to give up trying. Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"Movie review Inception - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Leonardo DicaprioMovie review InceptionChristopher Nolans mind-bending intelligent exciting and disturbing sci-fi extravaganza starring Leonardo DiCaprio blends the best of traditional and modern filmmaking.July 16 2010|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Movie Critic Dreaming is lifes great solitary adventure. Whatever pleasures or terrors the dream state provides we experience them alone or not at all. But what if other people could literally invade our dreams what if a technology existed that enabled interlopers to create and manipulate sleeping life with the goal of stealing our secret thoughts or more unsettling still implanting ideas in the deepest of subconscious states and making us believe theyre our own? Welcome to the world of ""Inception"" written and directed by the masterful Christopher Nolan a tremendously exciting science-fiction thriller thats as disturbing as it sounds. This is a popular entertainment with a knockout punch so intense and unnerving itll have you worrying if its safe to close your eyes at night. Having come up with the idea when he was 16 Nolan wrote the first draft of ""Inception"" eight years ago and in the interim his great success with ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"" not to mention the earlier ""Memento"" put him in a position to cast Leonardo DiCaprio and six other Oscar-nominated actors and spend a reported 160 million in a most daring way. For ""Inception"" is not only about the dream state it often plays on screen in a dreamlike way which means that it has the gift of being easier to follow than to explain. Specifics of the plot can be difficult to pin down especially at first and guessing moment to moment what will be happening next or even if the characters are in a dream or in reality is not always possible. But even while literal understanding can remain tantilizingly out of reach you always intuitively understand what is going on and why. Helping in that understanding and one of the films most satisfying aspects are its roots in old-fashioned genre entertainment albeit genre amped up to warp speed. Besides its science-fiction theme ""Inception"" also has strong film noir ties easily recognizable elements like the femme fatale doomed love and the protagonists fateful decision to take on ""one last job."" That would be DiCaprios Dom Cobb a thief who specializes in whats called extraction in taking secrets from the subconscious. Aided by Arthur (a fine Joseph Gordon-Levitt) the trusted associate who is a whiz at the mechanics involved Cobb is introduced in the middle of a dream involving Saito ( Ken Watanabe) a wealthy Japanese businessman. That one last job is soon proposed by Saito who asks Cobb if he is also able to do inception the planting of ideas a maneuver many people believe cant be done. Saito promises Cobb who has a past which prevents him from returning to his children in America the one thing he cant resist. If he takes on this one last job if he agrees to practice inception on Robert Fischer ( Cillian Murphy) the heir to a multibillion-dollar energy empire he will be able to return home. In true movie fashion Cobb has to round up a team to do the job. Aside from Arthur he needs Eames the forger (Tom Hardy) gifted at impersonating people inside dreams and Yusuf the chemist ( Dileep Rao) who makes the compounds that put people under. And with the aid of his father-in-law Miles ( Michael Caine) he meets Ariadne. Named after the mythological character who helped Theseus find his way out of the Minotaurs labyrinth Ariadne is a young architect who is needed to create the subconscious landscapes in which the dreams will take place. As played by Ellen Page adroitly cast for her youth intelligence and earnestness Ariadne is the teams last essential element. In addition to not knowing what theyll find inside Fischers dream (believe me theres plenty going on) Cobb and his team have to contend with a wild card Mal the untrustworthy femme fatale a woman with deep and complicated ties to Cobbs past and someone who specializes in finding her way into dreams where she is not wanted. The selection of Oscar-winning French actress Marion Cotillard as Mal typifies the care Nolan has taken to cast these thriller roles for emotional connection a move which pays off in the scenes she shares with DiCaprio. In addition to the impeccably professional Batman veterans Caine and Murphy the film is also on the money with the smaller roles including Pete Postlethwaite as Fischers ailing tycoon father and Tom Berenger as one of his key associates. The reason all these diverse elements successfully come together is Nolans meticulous grasp of the details necessary to achieve his bravura ambitions. A filmmaker so committed he does his own second unit direction Nolan is one of the few people to quote F. Scott Fitzgerald on film mogul Monroe Stahr in ""The Last Tycoon"" ""able to keep the whole equation of pictures in their heads.""1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESYoung fans lift Inception to No. 1July 19 2010The rise and reassessment of InceptionJuly 19 2010Inception to top box office; Sorcerers Apprentice...July 16 2010Inception breaks into dreamsApril 4 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTLeonardo DicaprioChristopher NolanCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-inception-20100716,0,5478728.story",200,inception16,inception,latimes

The wish comes true with ""Inception."" More movie news reviews <a href=""http//scripts.bayareanewsgroup.com/scripts/feed2js/feed2js.php?src=http%3A%2F%2Ffeeds.contracostatimes.com%2Fmngi%2Frss%2FCustomRssServlet%2F571%2F201110.xmlamp;num=10amp;del=yamp;rel=yamp;html=y"">View RSS feed</a> From a trippy opening dream sequence to a pulse-pounding finale thats a delirious mash-up of a James Bond flick and a Philip K. Dick novel the sci-fi thriller seductively holds you in its clutches. Not since James Camerons ""Avatar"" have I been in a theater where an audience so thoroughly surrendered itself to what was transpiring on-screen. Not one white light flared up to signal a text in progress. Not one person rudely transformed into a blabbermouth. You could barely hear an intake of air. ""Inception"" is a better film than ""Avatar."" While it is stunning visually ""Inception"" dazzles us not with technology but with smarts immersing us deep deep into the dreamscapes craftily manufactured by Nolan and his rich characters. Fans of his ""Memento"" -- one of the best examples of film noir -- should expect to find their brain cells revved into overdrive.Advertisement Blithely summarized ""Inceptions"" plot would seem confusing and impenetrable. Confusing? No doubt and thats what makes the film so enjoyable because we try to tease and puzzle out what is really going on. Impenetrable? Hardly. Always a master showman Nolan guides us through his dizzying maze and demands we pay attention. For our efforts he rewards us with a visually sumptuous world filled with intense seamlessly executed chase scenes and layer upon layer of trippy dream sequences.Have your say Vote and comment Agree with the FCC policy? I wont delve too far into the plot because giving away bits and pieces robs you of the fun. So heres a cursory overview A team of dream raiders for hire led by Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) attempts the risky proposition of planting an idea in the subconscious of a business-empire heir (Cillian Murphy the Scarecrow in ""Batman Begins""). The team includes The haunted extractor (DiCaprio) an ace at invading a targets dreams and stealing his secrets; the calm point man (Joseph Gordon-Levitt of ""500 Days of Summer"") a model planner whose feathers rarely get ruffled; the architect (Ellen Page of ""Juno"") the upstart new recruit who draws up the dreams visuals and seeks to find out what makes Cobb tick; the tourist (Ken Watanabe of ""The Last Samurai"") who bankrolls the endeavor and wants to be involved in the process; the forger (Tom Hardy of ""RocknRolla"") who can assume the identity of others in dreams; the chemist (Dileep Rao a San Francisco American Conservatory Theater graduate) who sedates team members and serves as their driver.The cast is impeccable. DiCaprio proves with each movie that hes matured into one of our finest actors. We know early on that his character has secrets to spare -- especially a wife (a mesmerizing Marion Cotillard) who haunts his subconscious. DiCaprio shrewdly reveals the extent of Doms guilt and desperation as the story evolves. Page gives a refreshingly different performance not relying on wisecracks as a means to create her character. And Gordon-Levitt again shows his versatility playing his character as strong-willed and stoic.All of the details are right in ""Inception"" the dramatic music by Hans Zimmer the sexy designer duds worn by the cast and the special effects that never overwhelm the story merely complement it.Simply put mainstream moviemaking just doesnt get any better than ""Inception.""""Inception""aSTARRING Leonardo DiCaprio Ken Watanabe Joseph Gordon-Levitt Marion Cotillard Ellen Page Cillian Murphy and Michael CaineDIRECTOR Christopher NolanWHERE Bay Area-wideRATING PG-13 (for violence and action throughout)RUNNING TIME 2 hours 28 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Talend Silicon Valleys latest tech IPO has a strong debutSource Tesla looking at cameras radar in Florida crashCartoons Hillary Clinton makes history Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

Comments (28) click to enlarge Inception The IMAX Experience Video Rated PG-13  148 minutes  2010 Does this thing come with a manual? British writer-director Christopher Nolan first made a name for himself with the noirish brainteaser Memento (2000) and his growing industry clout as designated auteur of the rebooted Batman franchise (Batman Begins The Dark Knight) has enabled him to finance ever more elaborate head games on the side (The Prestige and now this summer blockbuster). Inception delivers dazzling special effects and a boatload of stars (Leonardo DiCaprio Joseph Gordon-Levitt Ellen Page Ken Watanabe Cillian Murphy Marion Cotillard Michael Caine) but it sags and eventually buckles under the weight of its complicated premise. DiCaprio and Gordon-Levitt are corporate spies skilled in the mechanics of dreaming who assemble a team to get inside the head of industrial scion Murphy. If I tried to explain all the ins and outs of their adventure reading this capsule would take as long as watching the movie. By J.R.

First you dont remember how you got where you are--where were you before this cafe this hotel bar this endless circular streetscape? And second you can clutch a totem a small unique reminder of the real world that only you know the weight and feel. You see in Christopher Nolans imagination we can plug in and share dreams. In fact its a business that affords for DiCaprio and partner Joseph Gordon-Levitt to fly private jets and casually drop by Mombasa and Buenos Aires. They are extractors or really extraction-protectors. Like bank robbers turned guards they know all the tricks of breaking into a brain. Theyve done well enough hacking into Japanese tycoon Ken Watanabes subconscious that hes hired them to do the impossible plant an idea in the head of rival Cillian Murphy that will inspire him to destroy his company. This is a heist film where breaching security means psychoanalyzing Murphys feelings for his dad. But mental sowing--or inception--nearly never takes. ""True inspiration is impossible to fake"" cautions Gordon-Levitt. And Nolan a writer and director of dastardly inspiration throws that line out like a gauntlet. Fake his blockbusters? Impossible. After he threw Batman on the psychiatrists couch every screenwriter in town desperately gave their superheroes daddy issues. With The Dark Knight he raised the ante with an action film structured by Nietzsche. But before the Hulk spouts Camus Nolans racing ahead with an extravaganza where intellectualism isnt just the bones--its the films meat and pulse. Notice I didnt say heart. Inception is a chilly trick a film whose source inspiration is a book of logic puzzles. Nolan hasnt written characters; hes simply inserted Xs and Ys actors alive only as word problems where John and Jill wonder when their speeding train will break the sound barrier. Nolan is so uninterested in creating real rounded people that he names Ellen Page ""Ariadne"" to underscore that her young dream architect is the princess of the maze. (You wont see that name popping up at yuppie primary schools.) Clinical yes but what a marvel. The film is talk talk talk and then--kapow--a visual that knocks you clear off your chair say Paris folding in on itself like a box or an anti-gravity fight that leaves you breathless and tired. In seconds youll forgive lines like ""Shall we take a look at some paradoxical structures?"" Inception has the same 200 million price tag as Transformers 2 but here its money well spent. Michael Bay spent a small nations GDP on junkyard fireworks. This is movie magic--big beautiful stunners designed for awe and applause. And Bay fans will have to bring their mental A-game to a movie with the ambition to layer five true and faux realities at its climax and the assurance in its audience to trust theyll keep up. You cant warm to Inception but you can chase after it in its wake and cheer it for fighting the tyranny of the lowest common denominator. Nolan insists that people who go to big summer movies deserve a full body and brain invocation. And ticket sales back him up even if other studios arent listening. But Nolan doesnt live up to his own ambitions. He wants our money mind and heart. In his final act he thumps the grand philosophy that reality is better than a dream. Hes got what looks like an argument--DiCaprios wife Marion Cotillard chose dreaming over doing and at night he chases after her in his sleep--but his film itself cares so little about reality that were unmoved. Like Charlie Kaufmans Synecdoche New York the movie is a Russian nesting doll of wants and hopes and all the conflicting layers that make us human. Nolan and Kaufman are the only directors audacious enough to try to explain the meaning of life in under three hours. Only Kaufman loves the imperfections the failures the dead ends the dust bunnies. In Synecdoche having kids means sacrifice stress love and (daringly) apathy. In Inception kids are a platonic ideal. DiCaprio will do anything to get back to his son and daughter and were meant to care simply because they exist even though theyre nothing more than some pretty blonde curls. Inception is beautiful and bloodless. Like a dream it doesnt care how you got to this moment in the theater. It doesnt challenge who you were going in and it doesnt implant ideas youll carry with you outside of the multiplex. But for two and a half hours its the perfect hermetic fantasy--in the light of the lobby it hurts when that bubble pops. ""Its only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange"" says DiCaprio. And the only way to slip back into Nolans strange short-lived spell is a second ticket. 0 Comments Be the first to comment You must be logged in to post a comment.

Fascinating for the dreamer but as dull as a late morning in Slough for anybody else unless of course your guide is Freud. Or as it turns out Christopher Nolan the 39-year-old British director of Memento and The Dark Knight whose solution to the boredom of other peoples dreams is to collide their woozy ever-changing upside-down and roundabout nature with the thrust of a fast-paced men-on-a-mission movie and a startling visual language that mirrors their strangeness. Better still the dreams preferred by Nolan include images of Paris folding in on itself and a trackless train thundering through a city. The limited sleepworld excitements of retaking your A levels ad infinitum or forever missing a flight at the airport dont figure here.Nolan throws a perfect storm of stunts effects locations and actors at one big idea that its possible to pilfer ideas from dreams by a process called extraction which involves hooking yourself up to a drip falling asleep and entering the world of the subconscious. The holy grail of this process is to reverse it which is inception the planting of a new idea in anothers mind. Thats the trick that experts Dom (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Arthur (Joseph Gordon Levitt) aided by new recruits Ariadne (Ellen Page) and Eames (Tom Hardy) try to pull off while hopping from Tokyo to Paris to Mombasa. Theyre working for Saito (Ken Watanabe) in pursuit of business magnate Robert (Cillian Murphy) and their motives vary from financial to intellectual. But DiCaprio has another driver the memory of his wife Mal (Marion Cottilard) is haunting him and its going to take a lot of psychological spring-cleaning for him to reconnect with that lost world.All hail Nolan for mastering a higher class of mass entertainment. Like all good science fiction Inception demands we pay serious attention to pure fantasy on the back of strong ideas and exquisite craft - but it also combines fantasy with real observations about our sleeping lives. Like a dream Nolans film fades swiftly in the light - but while it lasts it feels like theres nothing more important to decipher.

""Inception"" Nolans first film since his mega-googolplex hit with ""The Dark Knight"" and his first as a solo writer-director since the now-legendary puzzler ""Memento"" in 2000 is supposed to be a dreamscape movie. At one point in fact we travel with its central Scooby-gang of characters into a dream within a dream within a dream and then into some deeper still more unconscious psychological limbo-state below that.Managing all these nested levels of narrative is a marvelously nerdy accomplishment no doubt -- but this is the most tight-assed vision of the innermost human psyche Ive ever seen. While Nolans images are visually impressive and powered by state-of-the-art digital effects and accomplished stunt work theyre always ordered and organized with anal precision. They dont look or feel anything like dreams. (Or at least not like my dreams.) They look instead like mediocre action films from the 90s or in the case of the supremely boring ski-patrol vs. Arctic fortress shootout found on Level Three like the Alistair MacLean adaptation ""Ice Station Zebra"" from 1968. (With Rock Hudson And Ernest Borgnine) ""Inception"" may have been directed by Christopher Nolan but Nolans dreams are apparently directed by Michael Bay.OK I know -- you want me to back off the high-minded analysis and tell you whether ""Inception"" is a good destination for those summer moviegoing dollars eager to leap out of your wallet. Sure I guess so. Its a cool-looking action movie carefully constructed and edited that uses all kinds of nifty locations and a lot of portentous-sounding expositional yammering. It inhabits a Philip K. Dick-style universe of psychological warfare that suggests ""The Matrix"" ""Total Recall"" and ""Minority Report"" -- all of them by the way better movies -- but its fairer to call ""Inception"" a maze movie or a labyrinth movie than a puzzle movie. Because as the wisecracking fellow critic sitting next to me observed every time the story gets puzzling the characters call a timeout and explain it.So yeah if you approach ""Inception"" with lowered expectations its a pretty good time. Problem is there are no lowered expectations around Christopher Nolan whose adherents have proclaimed him as the heir to Kubrick and Hitchcock and declared ""Inception"" a masterpiece. I dont want to get sidetracked here but let me suggest that the comparisons arent entirely misguided. Theyre just not helpful. Nolan has inherited some of Kubrick and Hitchcocks worst tendencies most notably their defensive compulsive inclination to work everything out about their stories and characters to the last detail as if human beings and the world were algebraic or geometrical phenomena requiring a solution.But the mysterious power of Hitchcocks ""Vertigo"" cannot be explained by the ludicrous official story revealed in the final act -- indeed it nearly scotches the whole movie -- and the attack of ""The Birds"" is never explained. As Kubricks career progressed he was increasingly drawn to stories that defied or challenged rational analysis like ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" or ""The Shining."" (I think Id put ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""Eyes Wide Shut"" in that category too but lets discuss some other time.) Nolan seems to have learned exactly the wrong lessons from these mentors. For all the complexity craftsmanship and color of ""Inception"" its yet another of his ultra-serious schematic constructions with no soul no sex and almost no joy all about some tormented dude struggling with his ill-managed Freudian demons. That same guy sitting next to me cracked that Nolan needs to stop seeing a therapist; theres not nearly enough sublimation in his movies.At least Nolan hasnt cast frequent collaborator Christian Bale on this occasion (theyll presumably be reunited on the next Batman movie) but hes only traveled as far as go-to tormented dude Leonardo DiCaprio last seen as the psychiatry-textbook protagonist of Martin Scorseses ""Shutter Island."" DiCaprios only 35 but hes become a vastly different actor in his post-pretty-boy phase and always seems to play guys who have a dead wife a sweat-gland malfunction and a really urgent need to find the toilet. In ""Inception"" that would be Cobb a dream-state spy or ""extractor"" who earns big bucks by entering and manipulating peoples dreams to drag out their most closely held secrets.Nolan throws us into the deep water right away and in many ways the dazzling first quarter-hour of ""Inception"" is the best part. There are no opening credits. In the first couple of shots Cobb washes up on a beach possibly in Japan and is dragged into a luxurious house for an audience with an aging yakuza gangster. No wait -- now Saito (Ken Watanabe) the gangster is much younger. Cobb and his sharp-dressed partner Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who seems to have materialized out of nowhere offer to train him to protect himself from dream raiders. No wait -- this is Saitos dream and Cobb and Arthur have set a trap for him. Unless hes also setting a trap for them But whos the sultry foreign bombshell (Marion Cotillard) who aligns herself with Saito against Cobb and doesnt really seem to belong here? You Might Also Like After that setting dissolves into a chaotic shootout all these people (or most of them) wake up in a modest apartment somewhere in Asia or the Middle East -- Iran? Pakistan? the West Bank? -- where an angry mob is closing in outside. Saito isnt pleased; he was auditioning Cobb and Arthur for a difficult espionage job and they failed. No wait -- maybe they didnt. How and when can the dreamer be absolutely sure he has woken up?So the themes ideas and characters of ""Inception"" are all introduced with brilliant economy along with its moral and philosophical universe. And then Nolan proceeds to hammer them relentlessly into the ground with an increasingly clumsy clunky plot and an allegedly profound mystery that just sort of fizzles out into what-if-this-world-isnt-real sophomoric musing.Cobb and Arthur are gray-market or black-market entrepreneurs and Cobb has warrants hanging over his head that keep him from going home to his kids in the United States. (Ill say no more about that.) His dead wife Mal (Cotillard) only visits him in dreams -- his own and other peoples even though thats not really supposed to happen -- and doesnt act all that friendly. Lets just say that as obvious names for ominous female characters go that one pretty nearly takes the cake. You didnt want to call her Fatale Chris? Or Eve L. DeMenta B. Yotch?These guys are experts at extracting stuff from peoples minds but Saito wants them to do something more difficult ""Inception"" where an idea will be planted in someones mind so deeply that hell believe he thought of it himself. (This is supposed to be so hard someone explains because the brain can always track ideas back to their source. Take that Joseph Goebbels and Fox News You only think its working) The subject is a youthful energy tycoon named Fischer (Cillian Murphy) who must be persuaded to break up his dying fathers superpower-scale corporation because thatll be a good thing for the planet. For once I am not being snarky; that is the stated reason.So Cobb and Arthur have to round up the team of globetrotting rapscallions always demanded by a movie like this College-girl genius Ariadne (Ellen Page) as the ""architect"" who designs the dream worlds; chemist Yusuf (Dileep Rao) to administer the designer sedatives; shape-shifter Eames (British actor Tom Hardy always a delight) to act out key roles inside Fischers mind. Its basically ""Mission Impossible II"" minus Tom Cruise and John Woo plus ""Oceans Eleven"" minus a sense of humor and Las Vegas plus ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors"" with Marion Cotillard standing in for Freddy Krueger. Except that I just made it sound a whole lot more fun than it really is. Nolan is completely uninterested in the plot superstructure involving Saito and Fischer which never amounts to anything and holds no surprises. He is of course supremely invested in the details of the three (or four) levels of dream narrative into which our terrorist heroes drag Fischer. Drugging him in awkward and implausible fashion on a Sydney-to-Los Angeles flight they first pull him into a noir-ish kidnapping drama in a gray rain-swept city before all going to sleep again and waking up in a corporate-espionage yarn set in a luxury hotel where they snooze down another level to the aforementioned Arctic Circle shootout which could be in one of the Roger Moore Bond movies or an abandoned Cold War drama with Sylvester Stallone. (""No mans ever broken out of the Soviet Unions super-secret Northern Fortress. But one mans going to break IN."")All of this involves a bunch of big-ass guys shooting at each other with automatic weapons which has to be the most arid and depressing depiction of the dream state Ive ever encountered. There are no surreal images or nonsense dialogue no illogical shifts of scene from the first-grade classroom to Moms kitchen to a whorehouse. Its all meticulously ass-clenchingly worked out One person has to stay awake at each level to retrieve the others from the mind-melting waters of Lethe and time passes more slowly as the dreamers go deeper. If theres one thing that dream-state movies need more of its math and genderless geek-girl Ariadne is all over it ""That means 10 seconds before the van hits the water Thats three minutes for Arthur in the hotel -- and 16 minutes for us"" (I made up that particular line but its representative.)Sometimes Nolans technical expertise produces its own kind of beauty as in a startling zero-gravity scene in the hotel corridors when the laws of physics apparently rebel on Level Two. But for the most part ""Inception"" is a handsome clever and grindingly self-serious boy-movie shorn of imagination libido spirituality or emotional depth. Nolan establishes a fascinating world loaded with trapdoors symbols and hidden secrets and then squanders the opportunity on an overpriced ""Twilight Zone"" episode. He casts Cotillard one of the foxiest actresses alive as a smoldering temptress who embodies all the female erotic energy absent from this universe and then literally locks her in the basement. Mal yearns to escape and get her claws into these constipated narcoleptic boys (and maybe into Pages prim androgyne as well) and this movie would be a hell of a lot better if she did. But shes a girl -- no shes a woman -- and even in dreams its too dangerous to let those run around loose. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Pictures Only in your dreams Ariadne (Ellen Page) and Dom (Leonardo DiCaprio) are part of a team that invades peoples dreams to steal information. ABOUT THE MOVIEInception   1/2 (out of four)Stars Leonardo DiCaprio Marion Cotillard Joseph Gordon-Levitt Ellen Page Ken Watanabe Cillian Murphy Michael CaineDirector Christopher NolanDistributor Warner Bros.Rating PG-13 for sequences of violence and action throughoutRunning time 2 hours 27 minutesOpens Thursday night in select theaters and Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY With Inception writer/director Christopher Nolan not only cements his status as Hollywoods most innovative filmmaker he has created a daring genre the surrealist heist thriller. Or maybe he has developed the dream invasion action epic. No matter what you call it the story is the most complex of any summer movie. Dom (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a thief for hire who can infiltrate dreams trafficking in the furthest reaches of the subconscious and unearthing dark secrets. Hollywood films generally regard audiences as below average in intelligence. Nolan the creator of such films as Memento Insomnia and The Dark Knight regards his viewers as possibly smarter than they are --or at least as capable of rising to his inventive level. Thats a tall order. But its refreshing to find a director who makes us stretch even occasionally struggle to keep up. CHRIS NOLAN Director likes to play head games RED-CARPET REPORT Stars get dreamy reception at premiere TRAILER Take a peek inside the mind of Inception The action takes place mostly within characters subconscious with mind-bending visuals. Most breathtaking are the implosion of a Parisian boulevard a runaway train careening down a Los Angeles thoroughfare and a midair tussle in a hotel corridor. Nolans inspirations include The Matrix Blade Runner and a fusion of M.C. Escher with Rene Magritte and Salvador Dali. Sharing dreams is a weird enough notion. Things get more bizarre when Dom takes on the challenge of implanting an idea in the dreamer. Assisting him is a team of experts superbly cast. Doms planner is Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) Ariadne (Ellen Page) is a brilliant architecture student who designs the dreamers worlds Eames (Tom Hardy) is a forger who takes on shifting dream images and Yusuf (Dileep Rao) concocts the sedatives that elicit the slumber that kicks off the action. Cillian Murphy plays Fischer the mark whose subconscious is being plundered at the behest of Saito (Ken Watanabe). Doms mysterious wife Mal is played by Marion Cotillard. Mals father Miles (Michael Caine) taught Dom how to break into peoples somnolent states. If youre confused youre not alone. Inception like Memento is so clever and intricately structured it may require repeat viewings. While some dreamscape planning is almost as compelling as the wild reveries the story bogs down occasionally in exposition and an overlong climactic scene. Page ordinarily a subtle actress wears the same expression throughout the film. DiCaprio is terrific as the guilt-ridden Dom. Here and in Shutter Island he plays haunted roles each taking place primarily in his head. Nolan has fashioned a story rich in off-kilter grandeur. But perhaps because we are so engaged in figuring out its plot Inception doesnt fully connect emotionally. The film is easier to admire than to fully grasp or be moved by it. Still its worth surrendering to the dream. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Standards Editor Brent Jones.

"Inception blew my mind but left me cold. Slate Sign In Sign Up Inception blew my mind but left me cold. Inception blew my mind but left me cold. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 14 2010 701 PM Inception Mind-blowing but not heart-moving. By Dana Stevens Inception With Inception (Warner Brothers) Christopher Nolan definitively proves that hes more interested in blowing the viewers mind than in tracking where the mind-shards land--or how and whether they can be pieced back together. The director who gave us Memento and The Prestige along with Batman films The Dark Knight and Batman Begins may be unmatched among contemporary filmmakers for solemn bombast--but hes also unmatched for visual elegance and genuinely original action. There are plenty of movies that will give you a spectacular chase scene through the streets of Paris but how many of them would think to fold a Parisian street onto itself until it resembles a three-dimensional game board designed by M.C. Escher? Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Escher is a good reference for Inception and not just because the film includes the image of a Penrose stairway similar to the one the Dutch artist created in his lithograph ""Ascending and Descending."" The action in this psychological thriller pivots on questions of perception and perspective questions of exactly the sort that fascinated Escher. How do we know the difference between reality and projection past and present memory and dream? If we agree to stop asking these questions and simply live in a shared delusion what have we lost? These are admirably ambitious riddles for a summer action movie to pose reminiscent of the shape-shifting and romantic trickery of A Midsummer Nights Dream. But in place of Pucks rueful speech enjoining the audience to imagine ""that you have but slumbered here/ While these visions did appear"" Inception is content to end on a Keanu Reeves-esque ""Whoa."" In a convoluted opening sequence we learn that Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a master of ""extraction""--the art of infiltrating peoples dreams to steal their secrets. Along with his partner Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) hes hired to engineer elaborate dream worlds that the victim mistakes for reality. A Japanese tycoon Saito (Ken Watanabe) hires the team to pull off a feat never before tried Rather than harvest a previously existing idea would it be possible for them to implant a new one in someones mind? Advertisement Financed by Saito Dom begins choosing his--fine Ill just say it--dream team including an expert forger (Tom Hardy) a pharmacist specializing in deep sedation (Dileep Rao) and an architecture whiz named Ariadne (Ellen Page). (There are moments in Inception when Nolans script lays the symbolism on with a trowel. Ariadnes character name is one of them.) Together the team designs a plan to invade the dreams of a young corporate scion (Cillian Murphy) whos about to inherit his fathers company. The plan they come up with is a three-level chess game involving a dream within a dream within a dream and by the rules the movie establishes the whole scheme makes a kind of ingenious sense. The problem is that the emotional stakes are consistently too low for the viewer to engage with the story. Its never clear why we should care about the relationship between Murphy and his dying father played by Pete Postlethwaite--their characters enter the story too late and are too hastily sketched to amount to anything more than types. Even more problematic is the love story between Dom and the specter of his late wife Mal (Marion Cotillard). Until he can let Mals memory go were told Dom is perpetually in danger of becoming lost in the dream world. (Mals name by the way means ""evil"" in French. Trowel) The idea of being weighed down by the ghost of an old love is rich with narrative possibilities but Dom and Mals passion never stops feeling like a clumsy narrative contrivance especially after Ariadne starts intervening as an amateur psychotherapist. In essence all of Pages dialogue in these scenes amounts to variants on ""Dom? Denial aint just a river in Egypt."" Its a shame that Inceptions visual sophistication so far outstrips its emotional savvy. The movies portrait of Mal and Doms doomed love is a far cry from Vertigo but its best set pieces are vertiginous indeed especially a long fight scene that takes place in a hotel corridor under zero-gravity conditions. The effects were achieved not with computer animation but with a revolving set and actors suspended on wires and the effort and expense pay off in an oneiric sequence that looks like nothing youve ever seen. The cinematographer Wally Pfister has worked with Nolan on nearly all of the directors films and hes familiar by now with Nolans visual obsessions sleek reflective surfaces forbidding cityscapes sudden down-the-rabbit-hole shifts in perspective. The score by Hans Zimmer (who also co-wrote the Batman Beginsand Dark Knightsoundtracks with James Newton Howard) hammers too insistently at the viewers ear lest we forget were witnessing events of great import. Lack of wit has always been a problem in Nolans films; the only big laugh in Inception may be unintentional when Pages character interrupts a mission-planning session with the plaintive query ""Wait whose subconscious are we going into exactly?"" I never really bought Ellen Page as a dream-designing prodigy; when she first appeared onscreen in her indie-girl duds all I could think was ""This is a job for Juno""  But its not Pages fault that her character amounts to little more than a peg on which to hang plot exposition. Meanwhile Cotillard brings her signature world-weariness to a disappointingly one-note femme fatale role; by the end of the film the unkillable dream-ghost she plays is essentially a pretext for target practice. Gordon-Levitt is excellent as the dream teams detail-oriented middle manager. As for DiCaprio Ive already aired my reservations about him in somber scrunchy-faced leading-man parts. Hes at his best when he plays a trickster unburdened by conscience yet both he and the directors who love him seem inexorably drawn to these guilt-ridden brooders. Even so M.C. Escher drawings are neat to look at and there are worse summer pursuits than solving the spatio-temporal puzzle of an intricate three-level dream even if the characters serve more as game pieces than people. At the end of Inception I hadnt lived through the grueling emotional journey Nolan seemed to think I had but Id seen a bunch of cool images and admired some technically ambitious feats of filmmaking (notably the editing of Lee Smith who by the movies climax has to cross-cut among four concurrently unfolding realities). Though Nolan is a prodigious architect of detailed dream worlds hes too controlled and controlling a filmmaker to give himself over fully to the chaotic logic of dreams. Like Slate on Facebook.

(Ellen Dunkel)By Steven Rea Inquirer Movie CriticPosted July 14 2010Lets begin with a couple of citations""All that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream."" - Edgar Allan Poe""What if nothing exists and were all in somebodys dream? Or whats worse what if only that fat guy in the third row exists?"" - Woody AllenInception Christopher Nolans epically silly overwrought noir is all about dreams and about an international dream thief - Dom Cobb played with his customary white-knuckle intensity by Leonardo DiCaprio - who enters other peoples subconsciousness and comes out with valuable secrets. The process is called ""extraction"" and Cobb has an Impossible Missions Force team to assist in his (literally) highbrow heists Theres Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) the details guy. Theres Eames (Tom Hardy) a shape-shifting identity mime. Theres Yusuf (Dileep Rao) a chemist whose concoctions put the subject(s) to sleep. And theres Mal (Marion Cotillard) whose relationship with Cobb is complicated by the fact that in the real world she is dead.In Cobbs dreams however she is very much alive even if the actress who won an Oscar for her portrayal of Edith Piaf seems unable to inject life into the line-readings. (Ironic homage alert A Piaf song ""Non je ne regrette rien"" is a crucial mechanism in Inceptions plot.)Cobbs specialty is corporate espionage but for his latest job the terms are trickier Instead of extraction he needs to plant an idea in somebodys head. His client is Saito (Ken Watanabe) a corporate titan who needs to have the competition put down. To do so the dreams of Robert Fischer Jr. (Cillian Murphy) the heir apparent to a giant global concern must be invaded and a notion embedded in the deepest layers of his noggin.And oh by the way this Fischer fellow has issues with his father. ""We need to shift his animosity from his father to his godfather"" somebody says as they prepare to mess with Fischers mind. Freud for Dummies anyone?Full of sun-burnished cityscapes (Tokyo Paris Mombasa) and visual references out of M.C Escher and Magritte Inception looks dazzling. When Cobb first meets up with his new recruit a young maze-building brainiac named Ariadne (Ellen Page) the two stroll around Paris - a Paris that flies apart and folds in on itself like a pop-up book. A crazy chase sequence through the streets of Los Angeles takes place in a silvery downpour the crashing cars joined by a giant locomotive barreling down the middle of Wilshire Boulevard. Of course there are no tracks.But the dream logic of Inception - which deals like Nolans far more intriguing Memento with the architecture of memory and the nature of reality - is stymied by a clunking script crammed with expository exchanges and urgent blather. ""The stronger the issues the more powerful the catharsis"" says DiCaprio. ""The subject is partial to postwar British painters"" he observes noting the screaming visage of a Francis Bacon portrait on a wall. And if you like the phrase a leap of faith Nolan piles more meaning onto it every time its uttered (and its uttered a lot).Like an illustrated dictionary of dream symbolism Inception rolls out churning waves of ocean (the films opening DiCaprio washed up on a faraway shore) the claustrophobic enclosures of elevators and hotel rooms the vertiginous perspectives from ledges and bridges. And while there is the occasional effort at levity DiCaprio and his crew are mostly stony-faced and severe as they hook themselves up and venture into the various dream scenarios. If some of this trippy business with its tiers of alternate realities recalls The Matrix well recall it it does but the head-spinning innovation and energy of the Wachowski Brothers film are lacking.Inceptions roiling third act is constructed as a dream within a dream within a dream and if you think youre experiencing deja vu - well havent we seen that snow-covered mountain fortress and its army of white-suited henchmen in a whole mess of old spy movies?""Wait whose subconscious are we going into?"" asks Ariadne at one especially critical juncture.Good question.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + The good news about Christopher Nolan is that he seems happy to have a break from the grand shadows of Gotham City. ""Inception looks as much like a blockbuster as ""The Dark Knight. It also feels like one. But its free of doom. For better and worse it weighs nothing which is not the same as saying it means nothing.Nolans primary subject here is dreams and its exhilarating this world hes imagined for us. In ""Inception its possible to access the dreams of others and within these dreams its possible for an entire block in Paris to fold calmly over itself creating a kind of living Escher lithograph. Its also possible for Joseph Gordon-Levitt to swim through a hotel corridor and along an elevator shaft like a dapper astronaut while conducting thrilling elaborately choreographed fights.Nolan uses cinematic devices to evoke or rework the mechanics of dreams. So if a van plunging off a bridge in say a Tony Scott movie takes only a few seconds here that same shot becomes ballet. The van takes the better part of an hour to hit the water. Its being held aloft by the amniotic fluid of slow motion and the cuts back to its suspended descent are as close to Zen as a Hollywood movie is likely to get.Why the van goes over the bridge and takes its time hitting the water is a separate matter. If entering someones unconscious seems perfectly natural in ""Inception then what interests Nolan is the criminal enterprise that springs up around it. This is basically a caper film. Instead of robbing a rich mans casino Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his extraction team raid the mans subconscious. Saito (Ken Watanabe) the Japanese businessman from whom Cobb and his partner Arthur (Gordon-Levitt) just tried to nab top secrets proposes an impossible mission -- inception. They would all enter the mind of the heir (Cillian Murphy) of Saitos business rival to plant a crucial thought rather than steal a secret.The plan necessitates the hiring of Ellen Page as an architect of dreamscapes; Dileep Rao as the groups anesthesiologist; and Tom Hardy as Eames a sort of dream-time impersonation artist. Its fun watching these people feel each other out. Page is perfectly cast but as sharp as her wit can be you forget how well she holds a close-up.The job presents an opportunity for Cobb to return to the children he had to leave for rather complicated reasons which have something to do with the volatile late wife Cobbs subconscious is having a terrible time suppressing. Marion Cotillard has fun playing the sketches that constitute Mrs. Cobb. Its likely shes zoomed through the subconscious of many a man. The stakes here seem a trifle low. For such a visionary director Nolan who also wrote this movie turns conventional on such standard issues as love and guilt and longing. He tries to turn his caper into an odyssey. But home -- where two cute kids keep their backs to the camera of Cobbs memory -- looks like a Hallmark nightmare. Not to mention that we just watched DiCaprio go through the same domestic woe in ""Shutter Island which like ""Inception concludes on a note of ""Twilight Zone ambiguity.Nolans is the better movie. He expends less effort than Martin Scorsese even in the orchestration of the films great heist. It lasts for about 80 minutes (the movie is almost 2 1/2 hours) involves at least two dreams within one dream and goes off with nary a hitch on Nolans part. He dances between the falling van the disappearance of gravity and an avalanche that could be out of the Bond picture of your choice. And yet the dreamscapes are oddly sane sanitary places -- no crazy sex or shocking repressed memories. Instead the subconscious proves curiously hospitable to action-thriller staging.I suppose this is what we get for spending so long in the mind of an executive. Nolans two Batman movies were also about the troubled psyche of a wealthy man. He appears to find the challenge of applying his imagination to corporate culture one worth pursuing.One of the best things about Nolan as a director is that hes not self-conscious. His movies unfold and fold in on themselves without the strain of labor or flash. But that lack of self-consciousness is also Nolans downside. While ""Inception grows more complicated it doesnt gather substance. You feel the movie gliding floating forward or down but the depths feel only directional never psychological. The many layers turn out to be an arrangement of surfaces. Were not inside a mind so much as an enormous boutique.Of course these are other peoples dreams and they present to Cobb the same physical challenge they do to Nolan. How do you pull this off? Namely by hoping your audience is too dazzled to ask.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. Follow him at www.twitter.com/wesley_morris. (c) Copyright 2010 Globe Newspaper Company.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet There are only a handful of filmmakers capable of infusing spectacle with ideas and among those director Christopher Nolan feels uniquely tapped into the anxieties of the day. Two separate but related millennial fears drive Nolans ambitious mostly dazzling new opus Inception We have no control over our lives and reality as we used to understand it no longer exists--or at least has been fundamentally destabilized. Squaring the beautifully engineered puzzles of Memento and The Prestige with the chaos and anarchy brought by the Joker in The Dark Knight Inception takes place largely in a dreamscape where thieves of the mind fend off attacks from rebellious agents that clutter the subconscious. Its a metaphysical heist picture staged in worlds on top of worlds like nothing since Synecdoche New York and executed with a minimum of hand-holding. Without so much as a title to orient the audience Nolan dives into the multiple realities of Leonardo DiCaprio a master thief whos made a business out of extracting secrets from peoples minds while theyre in a vulnerable dream state. His latest assignment offers a much greater challenge than usual Instead of retrieving information DiCaprio and his team are asked to plant an idea in someones head which involves fooling the brain into believing it generated and nurtured the idea itself. (Hence the title.) In order to pull it off DiCaprio recruits Ellen Page an architect of sorts who can build dreamscapes densely layered enough for DiCaprio his partner (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) a forger (Tom Hardy) and other co-conspirators to commit the ultimate in corporate sabotage. However the ghosts in DiCaprios own subconscious wreak havoc on the operation. Nolan sets up a uniquely difficult challenge for himself In order for Inception to work it has to reconcile the rational and predictable (represented by Page and her maze-like constructs) with dangerously fluid irrational impulses (represented by DiCaprio and his fevered psyche). The Nolan of The Prestige and Memento is more naturally suited to the former than the latter; the vast cryptogram of Inception has a core of real emotion but it isnt always matched by an abundance of visual imagination. Nonetheless the film is an imposing prismatic achievement and strongly resistant to an insta-reaction; when its over Nolan still seems a few steps ahead of us.

"In Inception Nolan conjures up a fever dream - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs 3 starsIn Inception Nolan conjures up a fever dreamJuly 15 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticSometimes the first adjective spoken in a movie speaks volumes. The first one you hear in the new thriller ""Inception"" is ""delirious"" describing the psychological state of a man played by Leonardo DiCaprio who has washed up (or awakened) on a beach and is brought into the home of a wealthy man he has known in other circumstances somewhere in time. ""Delirious"" describes the movie as well which assuredly offers audiences sights heretofore unseen. Despite riffs on everything from ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" to ""Blade Runner"" to ""Strange Days"" to ""The Matrix"" the best of this elegant brain-bender -- a heist picture with a frame designed by Salvador Dali and M.C. Escher -- affirms the prodigious imagination and clout of writer-director Christopher Nolan whose previous film ""The Dark Knight"" made a billion putting him into a position where such a dreamscape could be attempted. Like any commercial enterprise exploring more than one level of reality this one oscillates between willful disorientation and catch-up explanation. DiCaprios character Dom Cobb works as an ""extraction"" expert able to enter someones subconscious and purloin valuable information for a fee. (Hes the Carnac the Magnificent of corporate espionage albeit working with more electronics and pharmaceuticals.) Ken Watanabes impossibly rich industrialist hires Cobb not to extract but to implant an idea in the brain of a rival businessman ( Cillian Murphy). If this idea to break up his family company succeeds Watanabes empire expands and Cobb -- an international fugitive sought by extradition authorities -- can go home to America and his beloved kids. The plot I suspect will not matter much to people interested in diving into Nolans rich sleek series of collapsing surfaces. The entire narrative structure threatens to crumble at any moment whether Cobbs ""Rififi""-like associates including the dream architect played by Ellen Page are taking us somewhere visually wondrous or not. Marion Cotillard appears as Cobbs late wife whom he has obsessively devoted an unhealthy amount of dream-time to keeping ""alive."" (The entire cast is excellent including Tom Hardy Dileep Rao and as Cobbs right-hand man Joseph Gordon-Levitt.) The story skitters among three ""dream layers"" which finds its most obvious parallel in the video gaming universe. Five minutes in the real world were told equals one hour in one dream level and 10 years down on dangerous Level 3. Some scenes carry amusing echoes of a script conference At one point Cobb and the gang kick around ideas for a persuasive emotional context in which to place the idea theyve been hired to ""incept."" Nolan often accused of being a ""cold"" storyteller no doubt wrestled with the same challenge. (His solution Make the protagonist Cobb a father dying to reunite with his family.) In todays commodity culture audiences have become utterly blase about surrealism; the most insane physics-bending events are visualized in every other 30-second commercial or three-minute music video. Nolan no dummy knows this and his response to pop surrealisms omnipresence is admirable He doesnt attack us so much as enfold us into his images while bending over backward (sometimes unsuccessfully) to restate the narrative rules of engagement. Some of the sights are spectacular such as when Page and DiCaprio walk down a Paris street and the city folds over in half directly over their heads. The most rousing action sequence a fight in a zero-gravity hallway cleverly lifts from ""2001"" (and ""Royal Wedding"" in which Fred Astaire danced on the walls and the ceiling). Such dizzying high points compensate for lumpier bits of exposition. I wish the dream-action in the latter stages didnt strand us quite so long in the Canadian Rockies for James Bond-style shussing and shooting. (The movie photographed by Nolans frequent cinematographer Wally Pfister was shot in Tokyo; Paris; London; Tangiers Morocco; Calgary Canada; and Hollywood on a blend of 35 mm and larger-format 65 mm cameras.) And why was Hans ""Bombast"" Zimmer allowed to score what seems like every second of this 21/2-hour fantasy? Oh well. ""Inception"" may not be the ultimate trip nor even the first ""Matrix."" But Nolans filmmaking intelligence places him among our most persuasive contemporary fantasists. His student feature ""Following"" (1998) scrambled its chronology (as did Nolans later outlandishly clever ""Memento"") to keep us on our toes. I found myself wishing ""Inception"" were weirder further out. But while Pages character is named Ariadne the ""mistress of the labyrinth"" in Greek mythology the film is Nolans labyrinth all the way and its gratifying to experience a summer movie with large visual ambitions and with nothing more or less on its mind than (as Shakespeare said) a dream that hath no bottom. 3 stars MPAA rating PG-13 (for sequences of violence and action throughout) Cast Leonardo DiCaprio (Cobb); Ken Watanabe (Saito); Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Arthur); Marion Cotillard (Mal); Ellen Page (Ariadne); Tom Hardy (Eames); Cillian Murphy (Robert Fischer Jr.) Tom Berenger (Browning); Dileep Rao (Yusuf); Michael Caine (Miles) Credits Written and directed by Christopher Nolan; produced by Nolan and Emma Thomas.

Lets go with the former. Christopher Nolans film traffics in the landscape of dreams taking us inside the heads of his characters and bringing us along for the wild rides that take place there. On the simplest level its a caper flick about a thief trying to pull off one last score before leaving the business for good. But Nolan piles level upon level upon level each more intricate than the last. The visuals are stunning perhaps the most fully realized of any film. And yet as over-the-top as it may sound for the streets of Paris first to rise 90 degrees and then fold over on top of themselves in this context it is not simply showing off for the sake of doing so but a believable part of the story. Leonardo DiCaprio in trademark wounded-man mode (thats not a complaint; he does it well) plays Dom Cobb whom we first meet washed up on a beach. Hes taken to see an old man and then hes somewhere else with different people and then somewhere else again. Nolan doesnt simplify the story for the audience; its best just to hold on and wait for things to fall into place. Gradually we learn that Cobb is an extractor someone who can get inside a persons dreams and retrieve information there. He works with Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who handles the grunt work of dream infiltration. A high-powered client Saito (Ken Watanabe) wants what some think is impossible for Cobb to plant the seed of an idea into the dreams of a competitor (Cillian Murphy) a complicated process known as inception. Cobb knows from experience that it can be done but he also knows the cost. Still if he can complete this one last job itll mean being cleared of a crime he was set up for and seeing his beloved children from whom he has been separated. Thus he brings more members to the team - Yusuf (Dileep Rao) a chemist who will take care of putting everyone into a dream state; Eames (Tom Hardy so great as the title character in ""Bronson"" and exceptional here as well) a ""forger"" who can impersonate people in dreams; and Ariadne (Ellen Page) an architecture student brought in to help construct the dreamscapes in which the inception will take place. Why does Cobb need an architect? Cant he build his own dreams? Ah he can. But he wont. The reason why is a part of the story best discovered for yourself. So is the role Cobbs wife Mal (an outstanding Marion Cotillard) plays in his life. Loss obsession and the possibility of redemption are key themes Nolan is working with here. Mal will come to embody all three for Cobb. Nolan plays with a lot of things - perception and reality of course but also time. In life a second is a second. In dreams a second may last 10 minutes. In dreams within dreams the second may stretch to an hour. In dreams within dreams within dreams? You could be talking about years. (Who would want to spend 10 years in a dream? ""Depends on the dream"" one character wisely observes.) Nolan puts this to great use layering dream upon dream and thus story upon story creating an interlocking puzzle for the audience to figure out. (Dont worry its more fun than that sounds.) The dreams are as you would expect marvels of computer-generated effects but also marvels of Nolans imagination (he also wrote the script). While an architect like Ariadne can construct specific elements there are always wild cards to be dealt with ""projections"" bits of your subconscious that take shape in dreams. These can range from amusing to deadly. Movies like this are often suspect. Sure we know that Nolan who directed ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"" but also numbers the time-twisting ""Memento"" among his credits handles complex subjects and large canvases with relative ease. But here the effects are so immense and crucial to the story its easy to worry that were being tricked fooled into thinking were watching a movie that looks fantastic but ultimately adds up to nothing. Not so not in this case. Nolan goes to great effort to tie up the loose ends to hold the story together - inasmuch as dreams can be held together. For the movie to work the story has to work on all its levels and it does. So too do all elements of the film. Its a stunning movie the kind of thing we havent seen before the kind of thing so ambitious and creative you wonder when or if well see it again.

It cuts straight to the chase that leads to the junkpile without passing go although before it drags its sorry butt to a merciful finale youll be desperately in need of a ""Get Out of Jail Free"" card. Writer-director Nolan is an elegant Hollywood hack from London whose movies are a colossal waste of time money and I.Q. points. ""Elegant"" because his work always has a crisp use of color shading and shadows and ""hack"" because he always takes an expensive germ of an idea reduces it to a series of cheap gimmicks and shreds it through a Cuisinart until it looks and sounds like every other incoherent empty B-movie made by people who havent got a clue about plot character development or narrative trajectory. Like other Christopher Nolan head scratchers-the brainless Memento the perilously inert Insomnia the contrived illusionist thriller The Prestige the idiotic Batman Begins and the mechanical maniacally baffling and laughably overrated The Dark Knight-this latest deadly exercise in smart-aleck filmmaking without purpose from Mr. Nolans scrambled eggs for brains makes no sense whatsoever. Is it clear that I have consistently hated his movies without exception and I have yet to see one of them that makes one lick of sense. Its difficult to believe he didnt also write direct and produce the unthinkable Synecdoche New York. But as usual like bottom feeder Charlie Kaufman Mr. Nolans reputation as an arrogant maverick draws a first-rate cast of players none of whom have an inkling of what theyre doing or what this movie is about in the first place and all of whom have been seen to better advantage elsewhere. Especially Leonardo DiCaprio who remains one of the screens most gullible talents. After his recent debacle in Shutter Island Martin Scorseses dopey insane-asylum bomb one hoped for something more substantial from the easily misled Leo not another deranged turkey like Inception. He should have stayed in bed. Id like to tell you just how bad Inception really is but since it is barely even remotely lucid no sane description is possible. Lets see. It opens with crashing waves on a beach. In the middle of a July heat wave I wanted to jump in but the thrill didnt last. Cut to the battered face of Leo looking like a 14-year-old washed ashore facedown from a toy sailboat. He has come from another location conjured up in a dream and is fond of muttering jabberwocky like ""I am the most skilled extractor of dreams."" In other words he can close his eyes enter somebody elses dreams with his pock-marked baby face and blow up China. The excellent Marion Cotillard who has spiraled a long way down from her Oscar-winning role as Edith Piaf growing a wart in the center of her forehead in the bargain is the ghost of his ex-wife. Leo lives in a state of guilt for her death. He is also a thief plowing his way through dark kitchens waving guns with silencers to relieve locked safes of their contents. Living in a continual dream state he wants only to get home to his father (Michael Caine in a walk-on of fewer than a dozen lines) and two kids but first he must according to the production notes ""extract valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state when the mind is at its most vulnerable."" To this end Mr. Nolan works in something about the world of corporate espionage that turns Leo into an international fugitive. Now Leo and his team of special ""extractors"" must achieve ""inception""-meaning that instead of stealing dreams they must plant some. If youre still awake youre one step ahead of me. I dozed off ages ago. Policed around the globe by anonymous forces Leo is aided by a pretty college student (Ellen Page from Juno) with a kinetic knowledge of dream therapy who acts as a ""brain architect"" (whatever that is); a loyal assistant (a big waste of charismatic Joseph-Gordon Levitt) who floats through space without gravity; a two-fisted barfly (Tom Hardy from Guy Ritchies abysmal RocknRolla); and assorted villains who sometimes double as saints (Tom Berenger Cillian Murphy and Japans Ken Watanabe from The Last Samurai). The script is gibberish ""We extracted every bit of information you had in there."" ""This isnt gonna work-wake him up"" ""Im not in your dream-youre in mine"" Every new dream brings to life a new picture postcard. One minute theyre flying over Manhattan (""Our rides on the roof""). The next theyre heading for Buenos Aires by helicopter. In Mumbai they join people sleeping on cots in a sort of opium den where the patients pay to wake up. ""Im getting off in Kyoto"" says Leo leaving the bullet train and I wanted to shout ""Take me with you-and the movie too"" In Christopher Nolan movies I never know whether hes going to find an ending or not but I never have any problem finding the exit. Through the use of computer-generated effects buildings fold like cardboard containers cars drive upside down and the only way you can wake up within the dream is death. None of this prattling drivel adds up to one iota of cogent or convincing logic. You never know who anyone is what their goals are who they work for or what theyre doing. Since theres nothing to act the cast doesnt even bother. Its the easiest kind of movie to make because all you have to do is strike poses and change expressions. It all culminates on skis in the middle of a blizzard as Leo is pursued by machine-gun-equipped snowmobiles but you dont even know whos driving them. I have no idea what the market is for this jabbering twaddle-probably people who fritter away their time playing video games which Im willing to bet pretty much describes Christopher Nolan. He labors over turning out arty horror films and sci-fi action thrillers with pretensions to alternate reality but hes clueless about how to deal with reality honest emotions or relevant issues. Inception is the kind of pretentious perplexity in which one or two reels could be mischievously transposed or even projected backward and nobody would know the difference. Its pretty much what weve come to expect from summer movies in general and Christopher Nolan movies in particular but I keep wondering Can he do anything of more lasting value? Hes got vision but creating jigsaw puzzles nobody can figure out and using actors as puppets who say idiotic things dwarfed by sets like sliding Tinker Toys doesnt seem like much of an accomplishment to me. rreedobserver.com INCEPTIONRunning time 148 minutesWritten and Directed by Christopher NolanStarring Leonardo DiCaprio Ellen Page Joseph Gordon-Levitt Marion Cotillard Cillian Murphy Tom Hardy Ken Watanabe 1 Eyeball out of 4 Comment Filed under Cillian Murphy Ellen Page Film film review film reviews inception Joseph Gordon-Levitt Ken Watanabe Leonardo DiCaprio Marion Cotillard Movie Review Tom Hardy Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics The (Real) Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Origin Story Culture Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture Breaking Miamis Wynwood Arts District Is a Hotbed for Zika Politics Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://observer.com/2010/07/can-someone-please-explain-inception-to-me/,200,inception35,inception,com/2010/07/can-someone-please-explain-inception-to-me/

Photo Whose subconscious are we going into exactly?"" asks a character in Christopher Nolans sci-fi thriller ""Inception."" This gets a big laugh in a sublime brain-twister of a movie that plays out so intricately on so many levels simultaneously that a bathroom break comes at your own peril. Text for a few seconds and you may miss a key development. Leonardo DiCaprio leads a team of high-tech corporate saboteurs who descend deep into a targets dreams -- with quite a few detours some of them roadblocks set up by DiCaprios late wife (Marion Cotillard). In a season of brain-dead spinoffs ""Inception"" stands out as a singularly cerebral exception and will generously reward your 148 minutes of undivided attention. I strongly suspect a second visit will pay off even more. MOVIES BLOG INCEPTION GETS 89 PERCENT ON ROTTEN TOMATOES PHOTOS MOVIES OF THE MIND Not weighed down by the comic-book mythology of the two ""Batman"" movies and given a reported 150-million budget for his original concept writer-director Nolan is free to let his imagination soar on an epic scale. Abetted by a world-class team of collaborators hes crafted an instant sci-fi classic that surpasses its most obvious recent influences ""Blade Runner"" and ""The Matrix."" Unlike 99 percent of movies the less you know about ""Inception"" going in the better. So Id advise you to stop reading now and head for the theater. OK so you want more? DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb an expert at entering victims dreams and extracting industrial secrets. He cannot return to the United States for reasons that are initially unclear but prove to be emotionally resonant. Hes approached by a wealthy businessman (Ken Watanabe) who wants Dom to reverse his usual procedure and instead implant an idea in a mark. Dom is to enter the dreams of the heir to an empire (Cillian Murphy) and convince him to dismantle it to the businessmans benefit. With a return to the US and a reunion with his two children dangled as the payoff Dom assembles a dream team. Theres his longtime organizer (Joseph Gordon-Levitt); an architect (Ellen Page) who constructs dazzling dream worlds; a ""forger"" (Tom Hardy) who can impersonate anyone at will; and a pharmacist (Dileep Rao) who enables very deep sleep. It isnt just as simple as putting the victim to sleep for 10 hours. The team and their client not only enter his dreams but they enter dreams within his dreams and dreams within those dreams -- so those 10 hours can translate into 10 years on the lowest level. Only the architect knows that Doms late-wife-from-hell is lurking on all of those levels and maybe even one below that to mess with Doms mind. The idea of entering dreams to manipulate someone isnt new -- ""Dreamscape"" did that back in 1984 -- but Nolan raises the stakes with brilliantly deployed effects (Gordon-Levitt walking on ceilings is just one ""wow"" moment) and a fast-moving globe-spanning story. DiCaprio who has never been better as the tortured hero draws you in with a love story that will appeal even to non-sci-fi fans. Meanwhile Nolan ratchets up the suspense as he shifts seamlessly between the different dreams and reality. He blurs the distinction between dreams and reality so artfully that ""Inception"" may well be a masterpiece masquerading as a summer blockbuster. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Snooki network-bound Read Next Snooki network-bound Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 36605 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 18975 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 18509 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Pictures A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Inception is a chilling trip into the psyche . . . of writer-director Christopher Nolan an Anglo-American action director who shattered the Tomatometer of mass-consensus with The Dark Knight.Nolans follow-up offers more muted colors gift-wrapped themes and GQ leading men with stockbroker comb-backs over the frowns carved in their brows--indicators of high-minded artistry all. Leo DiCaprio has every reason to scowl shackled with a character named ""Dom Cobb."" Fugitive Cobb is a corporate espionage hired-gun expert at ""extraction"" lifting secrets out of targets minds. Drugging them then joining them for naptime Cobb can drop in to guest-star in their dreams and there pick the locks of his marks subconscious--often represented as an actual safebox as everything in dreamlife is signified by genre-movie totems. Cobb is planning his ""last job before he retires"" a mind-cracking with the untested mission of leaving an idea in his marks head. The target is the heir to a corporate dynasty Robert Fischer Jr. (Cillian Murphy) who must be persuaded to abdicate his waiting throne. This will be achieved through running amok in his subconscious and prying in the desired suggestion using Juniors daddy issues as a lever. (Do not linger long over the ethics of mental rape; Nolan doesnt.)Following caper procedure Cobb assembles a team his researcher (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) mimic (Tom Hardy) apothecary (Dileep Rao) and a novice recruit Ariadne (Ellen Page) the architect wholl landscape the dreamworlds that theyll hunt. Tagging along on her debriefing we get glimpses of Cobbs history his unresolved anguish over the mysterious end of his marriage from which spring his personal demons that inconveniently invade other peoples dreams in the vengeful form of former wife ""Mal"" (Marion Cotillard). Cobb also lays down the rules of shared dreaming to us via Ariadne explaining that ""we only use a fraction of our brains true potential""--a shopworn line that appears almost verbatim in this weeks The Sorcerers Apprentice though its a sure bet that only one of those movies will be buried in laurels. As Ariadne learns the ropes we get teasing flexes of the f-x budget M.C. Escher stairs and Parisian streets folding over themselves like a crepe. The Hans Zimmer score suggests we shouldnt be gassed on these images so much as I dunno respectful?The introductions to placeholder characters the taking notes through the tutorial scenes its all lets-put-on-a-show buildup to opening night the heist the stage for a moviemaker to show his stuff. Cobb slips Fischer Jr. his mickey on a Sydney-to-L.A. flight--its like an Olivier Assayas business-class thriller with context scrupulously removed. Nolan has blueprinted a palatial set piece inside Fischers sleeping mind an involuted whorl of dream-stages leading to deeper dream-stages. Team members break off in rear-guards defending one level so the rest can continue on in dreams-within-dreams. Nolan cross-cuts between each stage as synchronized alarm clocks tick toward zero while surface actions send rippling reactions along the chain.Three set pieces in one This Neapolitan ice-cream approach is ambitious--and pretty routine when taken apart. Cobb explains his art as ""a chance to build cathedrals entire cities things that never existed."" Those so inclined can follow the scripts breadcrumbs and read Inception as a metaphor for the act of artistic creation with Cobb as director-surrogate--but Cobb/Nolan arent constructing things that never existed. Fischer Jr. dreams of a car-chase shoot-out in the pouring rain (better done in We Own the Night where action was wired to character emotion) and a snowblind siege on a brutalist municipal building. The gun-wielding henchmen in Fischers dreams are indistinct from the ones that earlier chased Cobb through picturesque third-world streets in what was presumably reality. Its telling when one Dream Warrior quips ""You mustnt be afraid to dream a little bigger""--and pulls out a grenade launcher.Like Nolan the dreamweavers work from their movie memories (the center of Fischer Jr.s labyrinth is the intersection of Citizen Kane and 2001) and narrative formula. Planning how to get through to Fisher Jr. one conspirator whos obviously attended a few screenwriting seminars offers ""The stronger the issues the more powerful the catharsis."" Inception is a spectacle about creating a spectacle and Nolan keeps giving behind-the-scenes glimpses--here hes suggesting how we filter life through storytelling while intending to use these same dramatic rules to move his audience.Thats the idea at least. With his inability to let actors occupy a scene together Nolan couldnt pass Pathos 101 and here hes trying graduate seminar stuff. ""The catharsis"" at the center of Inception is based on Cobbs choice whether to go on permanent vacation with his dream-memory of Mal or to return to real life. Its deciding between eternity with a bitchy wraith presumably sexless like all of Inceptions subconscious or . . . that recurring sentimental snapshot-memory of his children? Dad Michael Caine who drifts through the production? Ellen Page barely considered for romantic-emotional counterbalance? Theres no push-pull around Leos torrid emoting and when the ""Were awake now--or are we?"" kicker catches you in the pants who cares? Its obvious that Nolan either cant articulate or doesnt believe in a distinction between living feelings and dreams--and his barren Inception doesnt capture much of either.

"Inception Dream stealer | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesInception Dream stealerInception is a thriller that makes you think and repeated viewings are recommended.Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is the only extraction team member left standing in Christopher Nolans thought-provoking sci-fi film Inception.  (STEPHEN VAUGHAN / WARNER BROS.)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticMon. July 12 2010Inception (out of 4)Starring Leonardo DiCaprio Ken Watanabe Ellen Page Marion Cotillard Cillian Murphy Joseph Gordon-Levitt Tom Hardy and Michael Caine. Written and directed by Christopher Nolan. At theatres throughout the GTA. PGThe most pertinent question discerning moviegoers will ask each other this summer is not ""Have you seen Inception?"" but rather ""How many times have you seen Inception?""Its that demanding a film one that will puzzle and infuriate as many people as it enraptures and enchants. Repeat viewings are recommended even urged.Article Continued BelowWriter/director Christopher Nolan changed the way people thought about superhero movies with his cerebral blockbuster The Dark Knight. With Inception he has boldly reinvented the heist picture once again rattling the cranium in the process. The film is the years brainiest thriller; it might also be the riskiest.Leonardo DiCaprio cuts a rakish figure as Dom Cobb a corporate spy who functions like the Freddy Krueger of the boardroom he enters the dreams of industry captains and steals their most valuable secrets. Its a process called ""extraction"" and for a price Cobb can also teach businessmen how to block midnight assaults on their most hidden thoughts.Cobbs talents are eagerly sought but they have taken a personal toll tinged with intimations of tragedy. Hes chased by memories of his wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) the mother of his two young children whose status in his dream life is as uncertain as her corporeal existence is in the real world.Mal is thus right at home in Inception where nothing can be taken at face value and youre never sure if youre inside your own head or someone elses.Canadian cutie Ellen Page is Ariadne a student architect Cobb hires to join his ace team of extractors. Her job is to design realistic dreamscapes of rooms and buildings that will help hoodwink the teams corporate marks. ""You are the dreamer; you build the world"" Cobb tells her. Ariadne also functions as the films ""Basil Exposition"" the audiences representative in trying to figure out whats going on. She constantly quizzes Cobb about actions and motives.Cobbs team also includes Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who works so closely in concert with him he could almost be considered his avatar. Then theres team forger Eames (Bronsons Tom Hardy) who can shape-shift to keep up with the ever-deepening layers of deception. Finally theres a chemist named Yusuf (Dileep Rao) who brews the drugs needed by both Cobbs crew and their victims to properly consummate a dream theft. Regarding the drugs the least compelling part of the film its a pity Nolan didnt devise a less hoary mode of psychic transit. But it is steeped in tradition The Matrix and its literary antecedent Alice In Wonderland two of many acknowledged inspirations for Inception both employed pharmaceuticals to enter alternate realms.Cobb and his dream raiders are given their most challenging assignment by a businessman of curious interests named Mr. Saito (Ken Watanabe) who wants them to implant an idea inside a rivals head rather than pulling one out. This perilous process is called ""inception"" (hence the films title) and it requires the triple play of negotiating a dream within a dream within a dream a concept thats almost impossible to fathom. The subject of the inception is billionaire heir Robert Fischer Jr. (Cillian Murphy) who has to be covertly convinced to dissolve the company about to be bequeathed to him by his dying father. Failure to do so Saito darkly warns could have dark consequences for the world -- we assume he means the real world.Nolan is far from the first director to use dreams and alternate realms for dramatic purpose. There are any number of film and literary influences found in Inception the most compelling being Last Year at Marienbad the classic brain screw by French director Alain Resnais that set a potentially dangerous romance inside an unsteady realm of doubt and intrigue.The connections are both visual and aural. Inception was filmed in colour but its so desaturated it resembles Marienbads monochrome steeliness. Hans Zimmers occasionally strident score strikes notes with Resnaiss work. Interestingly Nolan claims not to have seen Marienbad before making Inception but he feels he may have been unconsciously affected by films that were influenced by it. He also disavows any prior knowledge of Martin Scorseses recent Shutter Island also starring DiCaprio in which marital grief and concepts of reality and unreality are similarly explored to graphic extremes.Where Nolan breaks fresh ground is how deeply he probes the grey matter of both his characters and the audience. He makes no concessions to mainstream notions of plot and character development even as he constantly one-ups the thriller and heist genres with dazzling action scenes. A scene where a speeding train gives jaw-dropping new meaning to the old saying about having your thoughts derailed is sure to send senses reeling and hearts racing.Its no coincidence that Murphys character who is not as gullible or ripe for exploitation as he seems is named after late chess master Bobby Fischer who was as willfully mercurial as he was brilliant.Inception is just like that constantly confusing us even as it appears to be leading us on the path to enlightenment. Concepts and explanations are thrown out on the run -- ""Downwards is the only way forwards"" Cobb bafflegabs -- and there will be many times youll wish you could grab one of the small talismans that dream travellers hold close to them in the film in order to prevent themselves from forever becoming lost in a subconscious state.Inception isnt a perfect film. Nolan may well have overestimated the patience of the audience especially since the film takes a good hour of its nearly 2 1/2-hour running time to get its mental machinery fully cranked.At first Inception left me cold feeling as if Id just eavesdropped on somebodys bad acid trip. Now I find I cant get the film out of my mind which is really the whole point of it isnt it?The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr DREAM CATCHER Leonardo DiCaprio in Inception (Melissa Moseley) B+ Inception Genre Mystery and Thriller; Starring Leonardo DiCaprio Joseph Gordon-Levitt Ken Watanabe; Director Christopher Nolan; Author Christopher Nolan; Release Date Wide 07/16/2010; Runtime (in minutes) 148; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted July 20 2010 -- 1200 AM EDT Beware the critic who claims the ability to analyze Inception authoritatively after one viewing. As engrossing and logic-resistant as the state of dreaming it seeks to replicate Christopher Nolans audacious new creation demands further study to fully absorb the multiple simultaneous stories Nolan finagles into one narrative experience. First time around the movie -- part sci-fi fantasy part gun-toting heist pic part mindfreak all filmmaker brio -- is dazzling and buzzy. Its a rolling explosion of images as hypnotizing and sharply angled as any in a drawing by M.C. Escher or a state-of-the-biz videogame; the backwards splicing of Nolans own Memento looks rudimentary by comparison. Only repeated exposure can clarify for each spectator not only whats going on but also whether the emotional payoff deepens enough to warrant the arbitrary complexity of the game. This much is clear Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb a thief-for-hire in the corporate-espionage field whos able to mine info from a sleeping persons brain. Dom and a team of specialists including a right-hand man (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) an architect (Ellen Page) and a ""forger"" (Tom Hardy) who can morph into another persons identity have developed techniques to actually enter a subjects dream. And once on the premises they can steal secrets. Demand for their services is great and the team zips around the world. But Dom a man with secrets of his own wants to quit the business and return home to his kids. To do so he takes on One Last Job a mission with a twist Rather than extracting an idea buried deep in a dreamers subconscious Dom must plant the seed of an idea that will in waking life take root -- an experimental process called inception. Ken Watanabe plays the tycoon who hires Dom for the job angling to undo a competitor. Cillian Murphy plays the mark the heir to a rival business fortune. In a tall tale where every characters name is crafted to signify something to cultists naming Murphys character Robert Fischer is a sure sign that Nolan is setting up a gleefully rigged game of chess. Speaking of names consider Doms beautiful haunting wife played with tenderness and a wiry undercurrent of malice by Marion Cotillard Her name is Mal. As in the Latin for evil. One could discuss -- or just gape at Inceptions visual bravado and the way the production team braids real locations (Paris Tokyo Morocco snowy Canada) with perspective-shifting CG work into eye candy for MIT engineering students on Ecstasy. Pages architect messes around with the laws of physics exploding a large chunk of ""Paris"" with kinetic delight. (As the newest member of the team Page gets to explain stuff to the audience; for her pains the actress is saddled with some awfully clunky expository declarations.) Gordon-Levitt wrangles sleeping dreamers into a configuration suitable for transport in a zero-gravity environment in a feat of cinematic choreography worthy of 2001 A Space Odyssey. Any scene featuring the forger named Eames (as in mathematically elegant furniture design?) is compelling because of the effortlessly magnetic Tom Hardy (he played the title prison thug in last years Bronson). The influences of other filmmakers other films including The Matrix Blade Runner and James Bond movies -- peek out of every scene. But Nolan the temporal origami master who made Insomnia The Prestige and those magical movies Batman Begins and The Dark Knight handles his shout-outs lightly. The reality that jostles the reverie is that as brainiacally engaging as the movie is Inceptions emotions beat with a much fainter pulse. Nolan outfits Dom with an old-fashioned love of wife and children and waking-life emotions of grief and guilt. But between DiCaprios characteristic (and dont get me wrong often interesting) affect of broody complication and the generic nature of Doms longings the heart is far less engaged than the head for most of the show. I like the movies ambition so much that I wish that imbalance didnt matter -- that the daredevil rush to the (infernally open-ended) conclusion was its own satisfying reward. Im left to hope and wonder whether repeated viewing will shift my perspective. You know as in a dream. I cant wait to go back.

Pictures) With its dreams dreams within dreams and dreams within dreams within dreams Christopher Nolans Inception manages to be clunky and confusing on four separate levels of realitywhile out here in this even more perplexing dream we call life its being hailed as a masterpiece on the order of 2001 A Space Odyssey. Slap Wake up people Shalalala Slap Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb (the name sounds like it should evoke somethingbut what? Dummkopf?) who specializes in plunging into peoples subconscious minds while they sleep and extracting their corporate secrets. (Im with Freud in preferring unconscious.) But his new client Saito (Ken Watanabe) wants the impossible for Cobb not to steal an idea but to plant one in a business rivals head. Why is an inception more difficult than an extraction? The subjects mind always knows the genesis of an idea explains one characterwhich strikes my unoriginal and highly suggestible mind as dead wrong. But thats the premise anyway. Cobb accepts the job because he longs to see his two little kids in the U.S. and is forbidden to return on account of a Crime to Be Revealed Later; and Saito says that with one phone call he can make the legal problems go away. (He just can.) Then Saito says what in this kind of thriller are magic words Assemble your team. A team of colorful specialists Cool So its like Mission Impossible in the Dreamscape-Matrix Cobbs point man is Arthur played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt who also evokes The Matrix He looks like Keanu Reevess runty little brother. Eames (Tom Hardy) is the forger who can impersonate people in dreams without those dumb MI rubber masks. The chemist Yusuf (Dileep Rao) will create the badass sedatives that will hold the fragile three-dream edifice together. The brilliant architecture student Ariadne (Ellen Page) has two functions dreamworld designer and exposition magnet. Shes a newbie so Cobb has to explain to her how the science works. It takes a lot of explaining. Nolan who wrote the script thinks like a mechanical engineer and even when you cant follow whats happening you can admire in theory the multiple synchronized narrative arcs and cute little rules for jumping around among different flights of consciousness. He has two fresh ideas. In a dream you can fall asleep and have another dream in which you can fall asleep and have another dreamexcept time works differently at different depths. A minute up top might be say ten minutes in the dream an hour in the dream within a dream and below that years. Although the different levels look the same (too bad) the gimmick allows Nolan to have three clocks ticking down instead of one and the editor Lee Smith has cut among them in ways so ostentatious that hes all but sewn up this years editing Oscar. The other neat touch is the Freudian monster femme who keeps popping up Cobbs wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) who emerges from his own unconscious (even in other peoples dreams) to sabotage his schemes. Cotillard is clock-stoppingly gorgeous and has a great first scene. She surveys the debris raining down with glittering eyes laughing in delight. But after that the tone of her appearances is funereal. Mal is the key to the mysterious tragedy that eats away at Cobb. Up top in the waking world Ariadne worries to Arthur Cobb has some serious problems that he has buried down therethe sort of thing Tattoo would say to Mr. Roarke who would nod and reply Well on Fantasy Island he will have a chance to confront them. Actually Ariadne herself says later Youre going to have to forgive yourself and confront heran empty line and the only kind Page gets. Gordon-Levitt doesnt have much livelier material but he does fight a bad guy in a zero-gravity corridor and tie together a group of sleeping people with cords then float the human assemblage into an elevator. (I had no clue what he was doing but its one of the few wittily irrational images.) Hardy starts amusingly talking tactics for taking down the mark in the language of an empathetic therapist but then turns as grim as everyone else. As that mark a moguls unloved son Cillian Murphy is so preternaturally sensitive youre not sure what to think about whats being done to him. You cant tell from DiCaprio who wears the same haunted face throughout. Hes excellenthe usually is. But hes weighing himself down with guilt-trip roles. Inception is full of brontosaurean effects like the city that folds over on top of itself but the tone is so solemn I felt out of line even cracking a smile. It lacks the nimbleness of Spielbergs Minority Report or the Jungian-carnival bravado of Joseph Rubens Dreamscape or the eerily clean lines and stylized black-suited baddies of The Matrixor for that matter the off-kilter intensity of Nolans own Insomnia. The attackers in Inception are anonymous the tone flat and impersonal. Nolan is too literal-minded too caught up in ticktock logistics to make a great untethered dream movie. 1 2 Next Share this story...

If movies are shared dreams then Christopher Nolan is surely one of Hollywoods most inventive dreamers given the evidence of his commandingly clever ""Inception."" Applying a vivid sense of procedural detail to a fiendishly intricate yarn set in the labyrinth of the subconscious the writer-director has devised a heist thriller for surrealists a Jungians ""Rififi"" that challenges viewers to sift through multiple layers of (un)reality. As such its a conceptual tour de force unlikely to rank with Batman at the B.O. though post-""Dark Knight"" anticipation and Leonardo DiCaprio should still position it as one of the summers hottest classiest tickets. As a non-franchise follow-up to the enormous success of ""The Dark Knight"" this long-gestating project reps something of a gamble for Warner Bros. at a time when sophisticated original entertainments are neither as common nor as bankable as they once were. Availing himself of the resources that come with a studios confidence Nolan places mind-bending visual effects and a top-flight cast in service of a boldly cerebral vision that demands and rewards the utmost attention. Even when its ambition occasionally outstrips its execution ""Inception"" tosses off more ideas and fires on more cylinders than most blockbusters would have the nerve to attempt. Our guide to this world of high-stakes corporate espionage is Dom Cobb (DiCaprio) an ""extractor"" paid to invade the dreams of various titans of industry and steal their top-secret ideas. Cobb plunders the psyche with practiced skill though hes increasingly haunted by the memory of his late wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) who has a nasty habit of showing up in his subconscious and wreaking havoc on his missions. Thats what happens during a dream-raid on wealthy businessman Saito (Ken Watanabe) who is in fact merely auditioning Cobb for a far riskier job. The target is Saitos future rival billionaire heir Robert Fischer Jr. (Cillian Murphy) and the goal is not to steal an idea but to plant one -- the ""inception"" of the title -- that will lead to the dissolution of Fischers empire. In Nolans hands this ingenious conceit becomes no more implausible than that of a caped crimefighter as the writer-director grounds his flight of fancy with precise methodology and an architects attention to detail. Indeed Cobb retains an actual architect Ariadne (Ellen Page) and teaches her how to mentally construct every street building and room in the artificial world (essential if the dreamer is to be deceived) in a series of visually playful scenes whose trompe loeil quality brings Magritte and M.C. Escher to mind. In classic heist-movie tradition various brainiac specialists round out Cobbs dream team Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) his longtime organizer; Eames (""Bronsons"" Tom Hardy) a ""forger"" who can shapeshift at will; and Yusuf (Dileep Rao) who supplies the powerful sedative that pulls Fischer and Cobbs gang into a collective stupor. As the motley crew comes together so does our understanding of this strange mercurial world (which owes something to the virtual-reality dystopia of ""The Matrix"") and the rules by which it operates the consequences of dying in a dream; the nature of dream time vs. real time; and the perils of layering ever more elaborate dreams within dreams. Numerous laws and paradoxes come into play once Cobb and Co. plunge down the rabbit-hole at which point ""Inception"" takes on dizzying levels of complexity as the characters navigate the chambers and antechambers of Fischers mind. Its heady brain-tickling stuff and like the spinning top that serves as a key plot device it seems forever on the brink of toppling over especially toward the end of the nearly 2 1/2-hour running time (editor Lee Smith has his hands full at one point cutting feverishly among four parallel lines of action). The sheer outlandishness of the premise may open it up to some narrative nitpicking -- why do these dreams for instance so closely resemble action movies? -- and attentive viewers will have a grand time ""aha""-ing at certain points and poking holes in others. But even when questions arise one so completely senses a guiding intelligence at the helm that the effect is stimulating rather than confusing. Never one to strand the viewer in a maze Nolan remains a few steps ahead keeping total comprehension just out of reach but always in view; like a mechanical rabbit on a racetrack he encourages us to keep up. As dreams go ""Inception"" is exceptionally lucid especially compared with the more free-associative nightmare logic of David Lynchs ""Mulholland Dr."" or ""Inland Empire."" Those were movies to get lost in; here it pays to stay focused. Like Nolans 2001 indie breakthrough ""Memento"" the film toys with themes such as the blurry line between perception and reality the insidious nature of ideas and the human capacity for self-delusion; significantly it also focuses on an antihero captive to the memory of his dead wife. Because the picture privileges the mind over the heart Cobbs unresolved guilt intended as the storys tragic center doesnt resonate as powerfully as it should though the actors certainly give it their all Cotillard is a presence both sultry and menacing and DiCaprio anchors the film confidently if less forcefully than he did the recent ""Shutter Island"" (in which he also played a widower at the mercy of dark visions). Supporting roles are thinly written but memorably inhabited Gordon-Levitt cuts a dashing figure; Hardy tears into his smartass supporting role with lip-smacking gusto; Watanabe brings elegance and gravity to his corporate raider; and Murphy plays the unsuspecting dreamer with poignant reserve. Pages repartee with DiCaprio could have been sharper in places but the appealingly plucky actress makes Ariadne an ideal stand-in for the viewer. Shot across four continents by Nolans regular d.p. Wally Pfister and outfitted by production designer Guy Hendrix Dyas ""Inception"" is easily the directors most visually unbridled work; its canvas stretches from the skyscrapers of Tokyo to the bazaars of Tangiers from an amber-lit hotel corridor to a snowy mountain compound (a setpiece that plays like an homage to ""On Her Majestys Secret Service""). Pic has arresting effects and images to spare such as the sight of Paris folding in on itself like a book or Gordon-Levitts Arthur performing a fight scene in zero gravity (the explanation for which is even more dazzling). Hans Zimmers surging score trumpets danger and excitement with near-operatic fervor at times suggesting the worlds most portentous foghorn while Edith Piafs recording of ""Non je ne regrette rien"" serves as an ironic motif (and sets up a nice inside joke with ""La Vie en rose"" star Cotillard). If ""Inception"" is a metaphysical puzzle its also a metaphorical one Its hard not to draw connections between Cobbs dream-weaving and Nolans filmmaking -- an activity devoted to constructing a simulacrum of reality intended to seduce us mess with our heads and leave a lasting impression.

TWITTER In a summer of remakes reboots and sequels comes ""Inception"" easily the most original movie idea in ages. Now ""original"" doesnt mean its chases cliffhangers shoot-outs skullduggery and last-minute rescues. Movies have trafficked in those things forever. Whats new here is how writer-director Christopher Nolan repackages all this with a science-fiction concept that allows his characters to chase and shoot across multiple levels of reality. This is in some ways a con-game movie only the action takes place entirely within the characters minds while they dream. Following up on such ingenious and intriguing films as ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Memento"" Nolan has outdone himself. ""Inception"" puts him not only at the top of the heap of sci-fi all-stars but it also should put this Warner Bros. release near or at the top of the summer movies. Its very hard to see how a film that plays so winningly to so many demographics would not be a worldwide hit. Not that the film doesnt have its antecedents. ""Dreamscape"" (1984) featured a man who could enter and manipulate dreams and of course in ""The Matrix"" (1999) human beings and machines battled on various reality levels created by artificial intelligence. In ""Inception"" Nolan imagines a new kind of corporate espionage wherein a thief enters a persons brain during the dream state to steal ideas. This is done by an entire team of ""extractors"" who design the architecture of the dreams forge identities within the dream and even pharmacologically help several people to share these dreams. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb a master extractor who is for what initially are vague reasons on the run and cannot return home to his children in the States. Then along comes a powerful businessman Saito (Ken Watanabe) who offers Dom his life back -- if hell perform a special job. Saito wants Dom to do the impossible Instead of stealing an idea he wants Dom to plant one an idea that will cause the mark Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy) to break up his fathers multibillion-dollar corporation for ""emotional"" reasons. Meanwhile you meet the other team members -- Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) Doms longtime point man; Eames (Tom Hardy) the forger; Yusuf (Dileep Rao) the chemist; and Doms father-in-law (Michael Caine) who is not on the team but the professor who taught Dom to share dreams. Doms late wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) haunts his own dreamworld like a kind of Mata Hari intent on messing with his mind if not staking a claim to his very life. He doesnt let on about this but Doms new architect Ariadne (Ellen Page) figures it out -- which makes her realize how dangerous it is to share dreams with Dom. A good deal of the first hour is spent essentially selling the audience on this sci-fi idea. As you witness an extraction that fails and then Doms recruitment of his new team around the world the movie lays out all the hows whys whos and what-the-hells behind ""extractions."" If you dont follow all this join the club. It will perhaps take multiple viewings of these multiple dream states to extract all the logic and regulations. (At least thats what the filmmakers hope.) Something else might come more easily on subsequent viewings With incredibly tense situations suspended across so many dreams within dreams all that restless energy might induce a kind of reverse stress in audiences producing not quite tedium but you may want to shout ""Cmon lets get on with it."" This is especially true when the hectic action in one dream a van rolling down a hill with its dreamers aboard causes a hotel corridor to roll in another producing a weightless state in the characters. Even Fred Astaire didnt dance on the ceiling as much as these guys do. Probably what ""sells"" this tricky movie is the actors. In his second consecutive movie to question reality -- ""Shutter Island"" came earlier this year remember -- DiCaprio anchors the film with a performance that is low-key yet intense despite hysterical chaos breaking out all around him. Page too displays sharp intelligence and determination in the face of this absolute jumble of reality. Especially surprising is Murphy as the mark; you find yourself genuinely sympathetic to a guy who just wanted to catch a little shut-eye and finds his mind kidnapped. It also is nice that Nolan strives to keep CG effects to a minimum and do as many stunts in-camera as possible. This photo-realism certainly helps to keep the dream realities looking more plausible. Credit cinematographer Wally Pfister with so neatly blending the real and surreal without any hokey moments. Ditto that for production designer Guy Hendrix Dyas and the various stunt coordinators and effects teams. Meanwhile editor Lee Smith does a Herculean job of juggling those different realities. Sometimes originality comes at a cost though At the end you may find yourself utterly exhausted. Opens July 16 (Warner Bros.) Production Warner Bros.
