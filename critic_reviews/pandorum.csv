However with talented German fanboy Christian Alvart (Antibodies) in charge of the dark matter the dystopian premise is deftly set up while the denouement pulls off not one but two neat twists. Two astronauts Lieutenant Payton (Dennis Quaid) and Corporal Bower (Ben Foster) awake from hyper-sleep in a confused state. As memories of their Noahs Ark-style mission return they find that cannibalistic human-mutants are on the ship. As are two other humans scientist-turned-savage Nadia and fighting machine Manh. As the ships generator threatens to crash and tension rises the survivors suffer cabin fever and symptoms of Pandorum - a condition that induces hallucinations amorality and delusions of power. Alvart achieves a strong sense of scale but characters and ideas are lost amid a mess of fight scenes that oddly look like outtakes from The Descent.

The reason why they resemble the creatures in The Decent is because they adapted to a similar environment with no sunlight. It only made sense from them to look the way they did. Cave dwelling species lack skin pigment since they need neither sun protection nor camouflage. They are albino permanently white.These animals get very light colored because their skin pigment requires sunlight to make it work. They are also not mutants but a new troglobitic species.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 18 2011DaGiftFeaturedThis movie has a great build up like making a fire blaze on amp; up to the very end it leaves you puzzled amp; confused however just like resident evil solaris the sphere not forgetting aliein it leaves you awestrucked. this will make me add this to the other collection of horror-genre its original like the rest amp; the storyline as with the mutants are all wonderfully done will make me watch this along with the others in my collection again amp; again.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 18 2011DaGiftFeaturedThis movie has a great build up like making a fire blaze on amp; up to the very end it leaves you puzzled amp; confused however just like resident evil solaris the sphere not forgetting aliein it leaves you awestrucked. this will make me add this to the other collection of horror-genre its original like the rest amp; the storyline as with the mutants are all wonderfully done will make me watch this along with the others in my collection again amp; again.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 11 2010PaulFeaturedWTF This was an absolute wast of my time.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 31 2010YodaFeaturedI think the film does a pretty damn good job of putting you in Ben Fosters and Dennis Quaids shoes. They just woke up from hypersleep when it is normal to be confused and have memory loss but they awake alone in a situation that doesnt exactly help them get their bearings. Theyre scared cold and weak utterly lost even inside their own massive ship (whose mission they cannot remember) and the other life forms they soon encounter are either psychotic or bizarrely aggressive humans or clearly dangerous aliens/mutants/whatever. The audience has no omniscience and I think that lends well to ratcheting up the tension. My only real eye-roll at the movie was that the other creatures were a bit too Mad Max-y for me. But on the whole this is a (yes dark yes slow) careful and in many ways original story. One cool thing about space travel is the magnitude of time that allows for things like this story taking place over many years (coming across mummified remains for example). I put it in a group of other high-quality sci-fi films like Solaris and Sunshine that are largely disregarded perhaps for their generally slow and relatively quiet buildup of tension.

A similar constitution is required to endure the misery pileup in Alejandro Chomskis film about saucer-eyed abused teenage runaway Maggie (Angela Sarafyan) who roams the streets of Los Angeles quickly finding kind protectors in David (Jesse Garcia) an illegal immigrant from El Salvador who tries to teach her the right way to love and Esther (Bai Ling) a stripper who instructs her new charge to recite the Post-it affirmations that adorn her dressing room (""All things are possible for the ones who believe""). Based on the play Jersey City by Wendy Hammond who co-wrote the screenplay with Deborah Calla A Beautiful Life dispenses with continuity and credibility (when your career as a pot dealer is thwarted try selling handmade beaded jewelry) to become the latest risible City of Angels-set sudser about broken souls and crossed paths destined for the trash heap. Scream smash slap cry repeat. The only respite fleeting scenes of Debi Mazar as a librarian rocking a cardigan and reading glasses. (Sunset 5) (Melissa Anderson) A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - BRIEF INTERVIEWS WITH HIDEOUS MEN ""Everything I write ends up being about loneliness"" said the late writer David Foster Wallace in a 1999 interview. Wallace was trying to get at the core of his Brief Interviews With Hideous Men a four-part short story he wrote as a series of monologues which in turn are presented as a transcription of interviews that an unnamed woman conducted with dozens of men. In a dizzying whirl of language Wallaces fictional men explain how they feel about the women theyve loved or more often than not have failed to love. Actor John Krasinski deeply affected by Wallaces work has been developing the stories as a feature for years. All of which makes it even more painful to say that as a film Brief Interviews With Hideous Men is a disaster. Wallaces monologues are funny profane intense and at all times deeply emotional. The plot specifics of each mans story -- the who what and where -- are secondary to the clutter of language. Wallace used language as a kind of protective padding for his interviewees and the reader at his own pace must dig deep to find the essential truths. Filmmakers even great ones are always battling the clock a dilemma that left Krasinski little choice but to cut each monologue down to its bone. The stilted storytelling that results often rings false and the monologues -- delivered by some very good actors (Timothy Hutton Bobby Cannavale) who come across as first-year theater students -- no longer add up to much. (Sunset 5) (Chuck Wilson)GO  IN SEARCH OF BEETHOVEN In Search of Beethoven plays like a good if necessarily condensed critical biography. Drawing from archival letters interviews with contemporary musicians and historians and a generous selection of live music Phil Grabskys film takes us through the life and work of its imposing subject moving from Beethovens days as the ""piano virtuoso of Vienna"" in the 1790s through his establishment as that citys leading composer and his subsequent personal troubles and declining production. Whats interesting about the film is not so much its re-creation of the mans life or its presentation of his character -- which hew closely to romantic notions of the stubborn increasingly erratic genius -- but its consideration of just how revolutionary his body of music was compared to that of his predecessors. The films real resource is its impressive array of talking heads their intimate familiarity with the music and their ability to impart graspable insight as when two subjects offer different readings of the Ninth Symphonys seemingly incongruous ending. Only the angry outburst of one expert who uses Beethovens genius to deride contemporary art and ""video clips"" as comparative trash imparts a sour elitist whiff to the proceedings. (Music Hall) (Andrew Schenker)THE INVENTION OF LYING The Invention of Lyings plot hook sounds like a pileup of Jim Carrey-Tom Shadyac concept comedies. Ricky Gervais fuzzy parable exists in an alternate universe where nobody has made a word for ""truth"" because nobody tells anything but -- until one man discovers how to say ""things that arent."" That man is The Offices auteur also co-writer/co-director here. As in that calling-card work Lying is interested in self-deception as a survival technique. Basically a good sort Gervais Mark uses his gift to ameliorate the sting of the matter-of-fact on the meek -- nobody here has heard the old ""Everythings going to be all right"" before and its a revelation. In a moment of unction Mark improvises the comforting idea of heaven along with a Man in the Sky making up the guest list. Playing to a more credulous public than Jesus he doesnt need miracles and the viral spread of TV news makes him an overnight prophet. At times it feels as if Gervais has made a film as two-dimensional in its smug secularism as Bruce Almighty was in its vacation Bible-school pandering. When the jokes based on universal social ineptitude wear with use the film remembers unrequited love. Gervais plays schlub beautifully testing and discarding a dozen ineffective inflections sweetly suppliant in hurt. But though Lying brushes more big ideas than commonplace comedies it hasnt taken those ideas through enough drafts to work out their implications or -- harder still -- make them killingly funny.

Gone are Leroys cornrows short shorts and leg warmers The anodyne adolescents in 25-year-old Kevin Tancharoens directorial debut (written by Allison Burnett) suggest not the charismatic street-smart pupils at Performing Arts but the Up With People squares. Dont you know who I am? Like all good drama queens the students in Alan Parkers 1980 original which unfolded during an unmistakably Koch-era New York took up space (blocking traffic on West 46th Street) and disrespected authority (dropping f-bombs in class smashing school property). They also did drugs had sex (and abortions if necessary) and stayed up past midnight. The new class at P.A. is strictly PG sharing a chummy coffee with the vocal instructor (Megan Mullally) who takes them on a karaoke field trip to Lucky Chengs where not one drag queen is visible. Light up the sky like a flame. Though his gayness was awkwardly shoehorned in carrot-topped Montgomery was at least undeniably out in Parkers film. His closest analogue -- many of the kids in the remake are race and/or gender inversions of the original characters -- merely alludes to homo leanings through emo Efronesque bangs and a slightly swish carriage. Members of the class of 80 struggled to stay in school despite homelessness and crime; the greatest crisis in 09 finds a students Sesame Street work schedule affecting her GPA. The sanitized moppets in the new Fame sing the body generic. (Citywide) (Melissa Anderson)MORE THAN A GAME More Than a Game follows Akrons Fab Four (later Five) kids on the basketball court from their ""Shooting Stars"" traveling youth team into high school and a run of championships. The reason this documentary tells their story -- instead of that of the team that miraculously upsets the by-then-nationally-recognized starters in junior-year playoffs -- is because one of the Fab was LeBron James. Ignored in the films discussion of LeBrons transition to premature fame is his attempt to swing early NBA eligibility after the loss which wouldnt jive with the ""all for one"" ethic among the films many pep-talk lessons. The ostensible director here is Kristopher Belman an Akronite who played court videographer to King James St. Vincent-St. Mary team but final cut belongs to LeBron Inc. The recent PR flub of Nike henchmen confiscating footage of James getting gently dunked on in a pickup game testifies to the powerful trust authoring James legacy. The film could be a tie-in to the recent ghostwritten autobiography Shooting Stars. Most obtrusive though is the contribution of Harvey Mason Jr. producing and soundtracking who sets Game adrift on an endless sea of crashing crescendos. Good game footage a few clear looks at the kids behind it but mostly as processed as Space Jam. (ArcLight Hollywood; The Grove; The Landmark; The Bridge; AMC Magic Johnson Crenshaw 15) (Nick Pinkerton)PANDORUM Despite too many cheap sound-cue scares and a slow-boil plot that veers between tension and tedium Pandorum -- a dead-serious horror/sci-fi pastiche that unimaginatively borrows from everything from Alien to WALL-E -- gets sort of interesting. Flight engineers Corporal Bower (Ben Foster) and Colonel Payton (Dennis Quaid) awake from a years-long ""hypersleep"" aboard the Elysium a massive spacecraft launched from the increasingly uninhabitable planet Earth in 2174. With no memory of their mission they find themselves in an abandoned wing of the craft a predicament they discuss at great and scintillating length (""Its cold in here"" Payton declares. ""Its fucking dark in here"" Bower retorts.) Eventually Bower ventures out to get the 411 encountering mummified corpses of his fellow crew members and then the gooey writhing mutants marauding through the craft in search of human flesh. A team slowly materializes out of the terrorized survivors Bower meets on his way to try and reset the craft on its course to Tanis an Earth-like planet. Much slimy mutant battle ensues. Director Christian Alvart clearly attended horrors new paint-shaker school of direction (motto shaky = scary) but the scripts twisty end-of-the-world intrigue saves this otherwise leaden film from total self-destruction. (Citywide) (Michelle Orange)GO  PARANORMAL ACTIVITY For Katie (Katie Featherston) a San Diego college student things have been going bump in the night since she was 8 years old and a ghost attached itself to her. The unseen being that has been benignly haunting her for years thrills Katies loving but skeptical boyfriend Micah (Micah Sloat) who sets up a video camera to capture any supernatural goings-on. For his debut feature reportedly shot in seven days at a cost of 15 grand writer-director Oren Peli works wonders with stationary camera footage of the sleeping couple The bedroom door moves slightly; lights in the hallway go on and off; a shadow passes the bed. As the nights go by the presence seemingly annoyed at being recorded begins upping the ante and soon it appears that poor Katie is on the verge of channeling her inner Linda Blair. Grounded by strong performances by newcomers Featherston and Sloat who pretty much have the movie to themselves Paranormal Activity which demands to be seen in a crowded theater is refreshingly blood-free -- the fact that its old-school scares caused seemingly jaded 20-somethings at a recent midnight screening to squirm in their seats suggests that theres hope for the world after all. (ArcLight Hollywood) (Chuck Wilson) THE PROVIDENCE EFFECT Tucked in the closing credits for Rollin Binzers documentary The Providence Effect is a line noting that all proceeds from the film will be donated to Providence St. Mel the school that the film celebrates -- which might explain why so much of it plays like an infomercial. Located on Chicagos East side in the midst of a drug- and gang-infested neighborhood Providence is one of the best performing schools in the country thanks to what we are told is the revolutionary approach to education set in place by the schools founder and president Paul J. Adams III a former civil rights activist who has made education his battlefield. The first half of Providence is filled with platitudes and the repetition of buzzwords like ""poverty"" and ""achievement"" but nothing that explains Adams policy in nuts-and-bolts terms. Just past the halfway mark though the camera follows the school principal on her daily rounds and we finally see what all the fuss is about a robust music program teachers given the freedom to innovate their approach and school initiatives that send students around the world for study. The film never completely shakes the feel of being more an advertisement than a documentary but once it settles into a concrete illustration of Adams philosophy (""Youve got to believe and expect that the children can achieve"") it becomes riveting. (Monica 4-Plex; AMC Magic Johnson Crenshaw 15) (Ernest Hardy)GO  RASHOMON Akira Kurosawas ritualistic exotic philosophical action flick effectively invented Japanese cinema for non-Japanese filmgoers despite the movies global-village synthesis. A samurai crime story with an investigative Citizen Kane flashback structure Rashomon is a mesmerizing play on the mechanisms of fiction which not only contributed a concept to courtroom journalism but counts among its descendents movies as varied as JFK and The Usual Suspects. Presented in a new 35mm restoration produced by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. (Nuart) (J. Hoberman)A SERIOUS MAN The shtetl shtick that opens Joel and Ethan Coens new movie -- Jewish peasant stumbles on an old Hasid who may or may not be a Dybbuk -- tips its hat to the great existential comedy that A Serious Man might have become if it wasnt buried beneath an avalanche of Ugly Jew iconography. Set in 1967 in a Midwestern Jewish neighborhood like the one the Coens grew up in A Serious Man is crowded with fat Jews aggressive Jews passive-aggressive Jews traitor Jews loser Jews shyster Jews emo-Jews Jews who slurp their chicken soup and -- passing as sages -- a clutch of yellow-toothed know-nothing rabbis. At their center is the beleaguered academic Larry Gopnik (played by the excellent stage actor Michael Stuhlbarg) a decent geek clinging desperately to his rapidly shredding status quo as his family and his job threaten to fall apart. By way of plot Larry suffers buckets of abuse from this crew then seeks spiritual guidance where none is forthcoming until either by accident or grand design his life seems to get better all by itself. If this were it the movie would be no more than another dreary exercise in Coen Brothers sadism. But the visual impact of all these warty unappetizing Jews carries A Serious Man into the realm of the truly vicious -- and God help the rube who cant take the joke.

(ArcLight Hollywood The Landmark) (Ella Taylor)GO  SURROGATES A montage of news footage crisply introduces the not-too-distant future where the worlds white-collar professionals live vicariously through plastic-smooth swimsuit-cut surrogate bodies psychically remote-controlled by flesh-and-blood selves abandoned to storage and pallid vegetation. These superdurable avatars are free to live in (somewhat timidly imagined) consequence-free hedonism. No real victims means no crimes hence not much work for our FBI agent (Bruce Willis) until an unheard-of murder draws him to the ghettos of the offline human minority. As he investigates director Jonathan Mostow takes the tired anti-authoritarian formula of dreadlocked granola resistance against well-equipped state thugs and knots it in noirish contortions. Surrogates are played by human actors with the slightest emotional attenuation recalling all-CGI movies that spend untold millions reinventing life. Willis is fine as both his blond action figure (Zack Morris hair) and his actual self in trusty bruised-palooka mode. Mostow does good meat-and-potatoes genre work coherent even when reckless -- which is why you probably dont know his name. His Internet-era smash-up Fahrenheit 451 comes in nice and lean with room for a couple of cherry action pieces -- that surrogate bodies can be guiltlessly plowed over liberates his car chase and Radha Mitchell does fine acrobatics in high heels. (Citywide) (Nick Pinkerton) WHIP IT Drew Barrymore making her directorial debut is blunt onscreen and off- about her inspirations for this tale of an anguished debutante-turned-roller grrrl Take a little bit of Peter Yates Breaking Away (a teen townie trying to escape his humdrum existence and dad on a 10-speed) toss in Adrian Lynes Foxes (bored suburban girls screwing and drinking to Boston and Donna Summer) and add John Hughes Pretty in Pink (good girl makes bad choice in boy) and a bit of George Roy Hills Slap Shot (sports violence as metaphor for outsiders struggle). The only thing that keeps Barrymores effort from playing like an American Movie Classics rerun is the soundtrack an alterna-rock all-skate to which Junos Ellen Page goes round and round an Austin Texas roller-derby rink during her rather sudden rise from klutz-on-wheels to girl-power poster child. Pages beauty queen Bliss Cavendar is ultimately the least interesting character in the film -- a more-good-than-bad youth in revolt clashing with an overbearing but well-meaning Mom (Marcia Gay Harden) a sweet but disinterested Dad (Breaking Aways Daniel Stern) the best friend with big plans (Alia Shawkat) and the mopey-dopey indie rocker who fucks her over (Landon Pigg a singer-songwriter making his um acting debut). Highlights Andrew Wilson as the roller girls coach (ah so theres the Wilson brother who can act) and the roller-derby vets (played especially well by Juliette Lewis and Kristen Wiig) about whom we learn just enough to wish the movie was focused on them instead. (Citywide) (Robert Wilonsky)ZOMBIELAND The zombie movie -- that evergreen vessel for all manner of social and political allegory -- gets stripped down to its ""Holy shit Zombies Run"" chassis in this fitfully amusing romp directed with little ambition and even less distinction by first-timer Ruben Fleischer. Set in a not-too-distant future (Roland Emmerichs apocalyptic 2012 due for release in November is on the marquee at Graumans Chinese) where most of mankind has gone flesh-eating crazy from a Mad Cow-style pandemic Zombieland follows the requisite hardy band of uninfected survivors as they like the Griswolds before them make their way to the promised land of a Southern California amusement park. Woody Harrelson leads the charge as a leathery urban roughneck in the Snake Plissken mold with Jesse Eisenberg (typecast yet again as a virginal neurotic) Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin (playing a couple of scam-artist sisters) riding shotgun. Ho-hum zombie mayhem lurks around every bend but the movies comic tone becomes increasingly strained (as does Eisenbergs logorrheic voice-over) up to and including an indulgent movie-star cameo by a certain deadpan genius usually more discerning in his choice of projects. Who ya gonna call? How about John Carpenter. (Citywide) (Scott Foundas) Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke? NEXT Contact LA Weekly Follow LA Weekly laweekly L.A.

In addition while they were slumbering in the Land of Hyper-Nod their vessel has been overrun by homicidal albino ghouls. Are the monsters real or are our heroes suffering from ""pandorum"" a disease whose symptoms include shaking hands bleeding noses and going totally nuts? And as a follow-up question how brazenly can one film rip off Alien I Am Legend and somewhat oddly The Poseidon Adventure? As always Foster sells the hell out of his role but non-sci-fi fans may well themselves be driven mad long before the end.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Throw out the presence of Dennis Quaid and the new science-fiction/horror snoozer Pandorum could easily pass for a Roger Corman cheapie. In the Corman spirit the film saves money on lighting and casting by devoting half its run time to having Ben Foster wander around a dimly lit grubby seemingly empty spaceship in a dystopian future as if starring in a homemade creature-free Alien. Then the space beasties arrive looking like bootleg orcs from Lord Of The Rings and the film morphs from a tedious thriller in which nothing much happens to a tedious thriller/would-be mind-blower in which far too much happens. A slumming Quaid and Foster play spaceship crew members who wake up from a years-long hyper-sleep with only the fuzziest notion of who they are and what theyre supposed to do. Foster eventually encounters a few other survivors including sexy warrior Antje Traue as well as a plague of mutated humans who have devolved into grotesque monsters. Foster is convinced he can save the ship but will he be able to do so before the debilitating psychological condition known to Ren and Stimpy fans as ""space madness"" takes over and dooms the ship and its skeleton crew alike? Director Christian Alvart and screenwriter Travis Milloy attempt to cultivate a mood of slow-building terror in Pandorums action-and-spectacle-light first half. But they just end up padding out a film that at 108 poky minutes is already unconscionably long to begin with. Quaid and Foster spend far too much time trying to figure out whats going on but audiences are liable to respond only with a dispirited ""Who cares?"" Alvart doles out the scripts handful of ideas stingily which would be problematic even if they werent all hopelessly shopworn. In space apparently no one can hear you steal.

Named for a mix of paranoia and delirium ""Pandorum"" more strongly evokes the condition of deja vu. Pilfering from ""Alien"" and ""The Descent"" as well as artier movies in which astronauts suffer cabin fever director Christian Alvart (""Antibodies"") leans heavily on quick-cut shots of snarling flesh-eaters aboard a spaceship and still manages to tempt the viewer into hypersleep. Underutilized stars Dennis Quaid and Ben Foster wont keep Overtures medium-budget sci-fi horror vehicle from plummeting hard after liftoff. Rudely awakened from cryogenic slumber aboard their 22nd-century mission to locate a habitable substitute for Earth Lt. Payton (Quaid) and Cpl. Bower (Foster) find they cant remember the reason for their trip; nor can they make radio contact with anyone else in space. After a great deal of wandering in the dark homesick Bower discovers the dead bodies of fellow crew members some bodies that look dead but arent some warring survivors with very sharp knives and dozens upon dozens of beasts that bear a striking resemblance to the gurgling bald-headed sharp-toothed baddies of ""The Descent."" As if these creatures werent challenging enough Payton and Bower also have to reboot an onboard nuclear reactor -- and natch fend off ""pandorum."" Seemingly in deference to budgetary concerns top-billed Quaid is for the most part relegated to reading dialogue into an intercom (""Bower do you read me?"") as his character coaches Fosters more adventuresome one through various close encounters. Action-film vets Cam Gigandet (""Never Back Down"") and Cung Le (""Fighting"") playing shipboard toughs are called upon to perform hand-to-hand (and hand-to-claw) combat none of it exciting. As the vessels token female newcomer Antje Traue delivers her lines in a husky whisper which gets old fast as does Alvarts familiar habit of making every faintly illuminated pipe and tube onboard look like a potential alien limb. Special effects are none too convincing while sound effects are of the cheaply jolting variety favored by producer Paul W.S. Anderson in his films as director (""Resident Evil"" ""Event Horizon""). Other tech credits are like the pic as a whole lazily derivative. PandorumProductionAn Overture Films release presented in association with Constantin Film of a Constantin Impact Pictures production.

(Constantin Film Produktion GmbH) Joe Neumaier Friday September 25 2009 337 PM Title Pandorum Well save the usual litany of sci-fi movies ripped off or paid homage to for the last paragraph. After all the idea that sci-fi can be an original thought-provoking imaginative genre is about as old as ""A Trip to the Moon"" and one rarely given enough gas to leave the atmosphere. So what else does ""Pandorum"" -- which uses sci-fi/horror as its hyphenated description as opposed to sci-fi/thriller (like this weeks ""Surrogates"") or sci-fi/morality tale (""District 9"") -- have going for it if not originality? Well theres a genuinely creepy feel to its rusted-out behemoth of a spacecraft where a crew member Bower (Ben Foster) awakens after an extended sleep to find everyone gone except for the lieutenant (a tired-looking Dennis Quaid) who defrosts shortly after him.Soon Bower goes searching around the ship which is never a good idea -- especially in the year 2174 which is when the craft the Elysium took off from Earth due to our planets imminent demise. Eventually he finds that he and the lieutenant are not alone There are a few other passengers whove turned into survivalists the obligatory crazy old man who explains the movies secrets and a pack of white-skinned vampiric-looking creatures who screech and kill and eat people and can jump incredibly fast and high.The movie directed with some level of restraint by Christian Alvart works best when Bower is creeping along passageways -- some filled with ominous-looking tubing others creaking and cavernous with plenty of places to hide. Like a cheap Halloween haunted house these moments are all about jumpiness and for a while that works as does the origin of the species that spawned the monsters.But the movie soon turns into only a production-designed run-and-chase game and our curiosity about what happened to Earth and the crew is teased and teased again until the movies big letdown of a reveal.Throughout some obvious questions pop up immediately In the year 2174 humans can create a giant ship to transport 16000 people to an Earthlike planet yet when two guys with no memory of anything meet up after a long space-sleep the ships computer -- which theyre in front of -- doesnt have some future version of Google? The pods that hold the sleeping remains of humankind dont have some sort of emergency lock device to keep them from flying off into space? And most crucially flora and fauna and crucial enzymes can be transported through space in little canisters but they cant come up with a pill to stave off an onset of ""pandorum"" which here is a type of mania that causes paranoia disorientation and madness? Geez if they dont have that lets hope no one has any allergies once they hit the new world.Now for the obligatory list of sci-fi echoes found in ""Pandorum"" in alphabetical order ""Alien"" ""Event Horizon"" ""I Am Legend"" ""Mad Max"" (spiky clothing only) ""Pitch Black"" ""Planet of the Apes"" (both the 1968 and 2001 versions) ""Solaris"" (Soderberghs take) ""Sunshine"" ""Supernova"" ... and probably a dozen others.

Still were hardly home free. To suggest the space probe is malfunctioning is like saying General Motors has money troubles. For starters no one is running the ship. In fact the new sci-fi movie Pandorum begins with Corporal Bower (Ben Foster) and Lieutenant Payton (Dennis Quaid) emerging from hyper sleep in a dark groaning spaceship. Awakening like drunks after a ruinous bender they piece together the grim specifics of their mission. They also begin to experience paranoia a creeping horror that threatens their ability to function rationally. Their condition has a clinical name pandorum. Soon Payton and Bower realize that their spaceship the Elysia may already be compromised by an epidemic. While Payton remains in the control room chatting away excitedly on the radio Bower discovers that the bowels of the Elysia are rotten with vermin and that in their drifting rudderless state many - perhaps all - of the ships settlers have mutated into tribes of blind panicking cannibals. Bowers mission is to elude the clutches of pandorum (not to mention the cannibals) and find a way to get the Elysia back on course to Tanus. Otherwise life for those on board is kaput. Unlike most movies that throw a doomsday scenario at us Pandorum has an interesting take on ""life as we now know it"" thanks to German filmmaker Christian Alvart. The Elysia is obviously a microcosm of long-gone Earth and something very much like pandorum has contaminated the planets air for centuries. Alvarts cynicism about the current state of mankind helps make futuristic Pandorum interesting but what makes it fun is his evident enthusiasm and talent for exploring the conventions of sci-fi films. The Elysia might be without a commander but right from Pandorum s opening sequence - a gliding tracking shot alongside a listless corroding spaceship - we feel like were in the hands of a filmmaker who knows what hes doing. Alvart has an eye for spectacle and has used his 40-million budget wisely constructing spellbinding exteriors that pay homage to the past work of special-effects director Douglas Trumbull ( Close Encounters  Blade Runner ). But its the films interiors shots of Bower and reluctant recruits Nadia (Antje Traue) and Manh (Cung Le) battling it out with the hungry mutants that remain with us. By shooting hand-to-hand combat close-up in darkened oil- and blood-soaked corridors Alvart involves us completely in Bowers creepy crawl through the Elysias rotten core. Youll want two drinks and a longish shower after the movie is over. Although Quaid has first billing Foster ( 310 to Yuma ) an actor with a sinister bent is the star here. And he makes a fitting representative for mankind exhibiting an intriguing mixture of tenderness and rage. Handsomely mounted emotionally involving sci-fi movies dont often show up in the darkened galaxies of our theatre chains. So Alvarts English-language debut is definitely a film you want to catch on the big screen. Just dont sit too close lest you end up with a dose of pandorum. That would ruin the rest of your weekend.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Magnificent desolation - Buzz Aldrins lyrical description of the moonscape as seen from its lonesome surface - has inspired poets and artists. But to science-fiction filmmakers and writers the phrase usually inspires terror. Travel to Mars the stars and beyond often risks a killer case of space madness. So it goes screamingly in ""Pandorum a highly effective sci-fi thriller set during a 2174 mission to colonize a far-off newly discovered Earth-like planet.One crewman (Ben Foster) revives from deep hypersleep into a nightmare. The ship is ominously dark its reactor broken. Bad signs - spiders in the air shafts Oozing crud on the walls - ought to alert the crew if not the audience that theyve slumbered too long. Despite help from the ranking officer (Dennis Quaid) the crisis worsens. Its testament to Quaids skill as an actor that he seems genuinely creeped out by the situation even though hes played astronauts so often he seems qualified to pilot the space shuttle.More disconcerting are the dreadful growls coming from deep within the crafts shadowy metallic corridors. Could these be symptoms of what the movie calls Pandorum madness - the demons of the mind demons mutated and escaped from a genetic storage facility or something worse?Naturally its something worse.Director Christian Alvart and screenwriter Travis Malloy must have seen ""Aliens in the cradle for theyve digested it with love and delivered smart thrills that will please more than genre fans. The filmmakers understand the difference between cheap shocks of gruesome discovery and the shudder that comes when a character casts a backward half-look over the shoulder toward terrors more familiar.As one doomed character warns pointing at the heros gun before fleeing into the recesses of the spaceship ""Thats not going to save you.""Pandorum is a dark disquieting dream worth watching out for.

Check out the best travel deals and destinations Entertainment Entertainment Movie review Pandorum -- 3 out of 5 stars Pandorum Overture Films Stranded on a spacecraft two astronauts awaken from a hyper-sleep and realize they are not alone. With Dennis Quaid Ben Foster. Directed by Christian Alvart. Screenplay by Travis Milloy; story by Milloy and Alvart. Overture Films Sept. 25 Stranded on a spacecraft two astronauts awaken from a hyper-sleep and realize they are not alone. With Dennis Quaid Ben Foster. Directed by Christian Alvart. Screenplay by Travis Milloy; story by Milloy and Alvart. Overture Films Sept. 25 (Overture Films) Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Pandorum plays like the best movie based on a video game to not actually have a video game to base it on ever.More to the point its a tight minimalist Alien-esque ""something is loose and hunting people on our space ship"" picture that is as claustrophobic as youd expect if not quite as paranoid as you might hope. Ben Foster (310 to Yuma) and Dennis Quaid play two members of the crew of the Elysium a vast colonizer ship sent from a fatally overcrowded Earth to an Earth-like planet more than 100 years flight-time away. They awaken confused. Procedure hasnt been followed. The crew shift that was to awaken them is nowhere to be found. Their memories are barely functional after a long sleep. The power is failing. The ship is making creaking noises that arent confidence-inspiring. Theres no way out of the compartment theyre in and no one responds to their radio calls.So the younger one Bower (Foster) climbs through the dark air ducts to try and find a way to open the door. Payton (Quaid) stays behind to guide him through the maze using a computer on backup power. It is what Bower finds out there in the dark corridors darker storage bins lockers equipment rooms and cryo-sleep warehouses of the ship that is really creepy. Some people are apparently awake. No one can answer his questions -- ""What happened? Where are we?"" Most of them dont live long enough to because something a lot of somethings are hunting them.Bower sets off on a mission to ""re-boot"" the ships reactor to save himself and whoever else is still alive on the ship encountering beasties colonists who turned themselves into warriors and survivalists (Antje Traue and Cung Le) and a guy (Eddie Rouse) who has gone off the deep end. This last fellow has taken up residence in a storage area and covered the walls with his own cave paintings telling the tale of the madness that may have brought them all to ruin.Emotionally investing in the characters isnt easy but theres a lot to like in this lean mildly scary but always engrossing film from Christian Alvart. He uses the darkness the confined spaces and limited color palette well stages his shocks with some brio and makes the standard ""ticking clock"" plot work though perhaps not as thrillingly as wed hope.Quaid playing the man left behind must deal with another crew member (Cam Gigandet) who crawls in through the ducts so that they can debate which of them has gone space-sick ""Pandorum"" a form of homicidal madness brought on by cryo-sleep the confines of long space travel and flaws in your psyche. Alvart maintains some mystery about what is really going on in these scenes though perhaps not enough. But whats here is still entertaining as a movie even if one suspects that the real money will be in the game based on Pandorum.

"Surrogates and Pandorum Clones of sci-fi classics | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsOpinionSurrogates and Pandorum Clones of sci-fi classicsIn space no one can hear you scream ""ripoff""Bruce Willis -- or is that his robot clone? -- pulls double duty as an FBI agent in Surrogates the stronger of two derivative sci-fi movies opening today.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Sept. 25 2009 Surrogates (out of 4) Starring Bruce Willis Radha Mitchell Rosamund Pike and Ving Rhames. Directed by Jonathan Mostow. 96 minutes. At major theatres. PG Pandorum (out of 4) Starring Ben Foster Dennis Quaid Antje Traue andCam Gigandet. Directed by Christian Alvart. 108 minutes. At major theatres. 14A In space no one can hear you scream ""ripoff""Not on Earth either. Especially in that alien territory known as Hollywood where originality long ago had a plastic stake driven through its heart.So it is that today brings two highly derivative sci-fi movies Surrogates and Pandorum each laden with more debris than WALL-Es junk pile. Take a deep breath for the ripoff rap sheet which is far from complete. Surrogates starring Bruce Willis as a homicide cop hunting a high-tech killer is an amalgam of The Matrix Blade Runner The Island The Stepford Wives Terminator Westworld and I Robot. Pandorum starring Ben Foster and Dennis Quaid as stranded astronauts on a ship of fanged cannibals steals from Alien Aliens Event Horizon Pitch Black Resident Evil and the video game Dead Space. Together the two movies pretty much cover the known sci-fi universe with the creepier Pandorum leaning towards the sub-genre known as sci-fi horror. But heres the astonishing thing theyre both okay in a copycat sort of way and the stronger Surrogates bleakly satirizes our increasingly plugged-in world. If theres one thing science has taught us this week its that not all clones are created equal.The poster image of a greying and grizzled Willis is a tip that Surrogates isnt just another of the actors paycheque gigs. He pulls double duty here as both human and robot and actually breaks a sweat and comes close to tears.His human form is FBI Agent Greer a man largely made redundant by technology. The year is 2017 and humans have voluntarily replaced themselves with mechanical clones that not only do all the heavy lifting they also do all the living. People remain in bed tethered to remote controls while their perfectly coiffed and sculptured bots go out into the big bad world. But the world isnt so bad any more because robots arent inclined to crime and violence the way fallible humans are - or are they?Greers ""surry"" has pancake makeup and a cute blond toupee but he still possesses an attitude. On the job hes teamed with Radha Mitchells waxen Agent Peters who never blinks. At home Greer is nominally married to Rosamund Pikes brittle Maggie who averts his gaze. She doesnt possess the warmth even of a Stepford gal. The mundanity of modernity is shattered when a surrogate is ""murdered"" and its human host fatally feels the impact. Thats not supposed to happen and the ex-human happens to be linked to the man who invented surrogates and changed the world. Someone or something apparently wants to reboot the status quo again and Greer is just the man - or machine - to find out why.Willis is fully engaged with the film which is deeper than anything weve come to expect lately from director Jonathan Mostow who drove the last two Terminator movies straight off a computer-rendered cliff. But he also made the superior thrillers Breakdown and U-571 a decade or so ago so perhaps he (or a surrogate?) is returning to form. Pandorums adequacy is perhaps more of a shock since it very nearly fell into that terrifying category of the Friday Dreadful those benighted strips of celluloid abandoned by their studios and deprived of critical previews.The year is 2174 and were advised up front that the Earths battle to control global warming and to conserve scarce resources has been about as effective as a broken fly swatter.Theres nothing to do but attempt the Hail Mary pass of shipping vast loads of humanity spacewards in the hope of finding more hospitable climes elsewhere in the galaxy. It will be a long trip so everybody has to make like an icicle and chill the folk out.But when astronauts Bower (Ben Foster) and Payton (Dennis Quaid) are suddenly thawed from their cryogenic slumber they discover theyre chillingly alone yet not really alone.Students of Sci-fi 101 and anyone who has seen the Pandorum trailer know that this means there are things both good and bad hidden aboard the cavernous space ark and the latter have a tendency to shriek to spurt icky black ooze and to snack on human flesh. The title incidentally refers to a deep-space version of going stir crazy which doesnt help when youre attempting to restart a wonky nuclear reactor (theyre still using nukes in 2174?) and to outrun a band of greasy cannibals.Directed by Germanys Christian Alvart Pandorum both starts and ends well never a sure thing with movies of this ilk. The long middle portion does get tedious obvious and downright laughable but sci-fi fans probably wont regret the experience. And its always gratifying to know that even in the direst of circumstances female space travellers still remember to don bust-revealing skin-tight outfits. The baser human instincts remain even in worlds overrun by robots and cannibals.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.
