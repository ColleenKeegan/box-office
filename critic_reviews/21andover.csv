Dudes and Their Butts The Motion Picture By Bilge Ebiri Follow BilgeEbiri The films young audience of horny boys may actually be perturbed at the endless male nudity on display. 17 Shares Share 9 Tweet 8 Share 0 Share Email Print Share Photo John Johnson Or Dudes and Their Butts -- The Motion Picture. Look we all know that gay panic long ago went from being the subtext of the boys-night-out genre to becoming one of its main punchlines. Think back to Ashton Kutcher and Seann William Scott making out in a car in Dude Wheres My Car? or Rob Corddry going down on Craig Robinson in Hot Tub Time Machine or Ed Helms having sex with a ladyboy in The Hangover Part II. And while 21 and Over cant match those films for laughs Id be lying if I said I didnt chuckle occasionally at the degree to which it takes the whole latent homosexuality thing to new levels. Indeed the films young audience of horny boys may actually be perturbed at the endless male nudity on display. Alas thats about the only interesting thing about this otherwise glum cash-in. Actually thats not true. The film does sport some decent performances from its young cast chief among them Miles Teller who brings an unexpected bit of charisma to the familiar role of the lovable dickhead who spends all his time thinking about how hard he and his buds are going to party. (I used to call this the Bradley-Cooper-in-training role but then Cooper got himself nominated for an Oscar and now makes award-winning movies so his throne stands empty.) Miller and his slightly nerdy friend Casey (Skylar Astin last seen as the male lead in Pitch Perfect) are headed to their friend Jeff Changs (Justin Chong) college to celebrate the young mans turning 21. They want to go drinking but JeffChang (thats how they pronounce his name ""JeffChang"") has a med school interview early in the morning not to mention a hard-ass father determined to make sure he doesnt miss it. Still Miller and Caseys powers of persuasion are mighty; as Miller puts it ""Im going to fuck you with alcohol."" So before we know it JeffChang is rocked out of his gourd barely conscious while his slightly less wasted buds are trying to get him back to his dorm. Things dont go as planned clothes are shed comical yet horrific acts of violence are committed jocks (in this case male cheerleaders) are humiliated a Hispanic sorority is mobilized into a retributory force cops are called etc. It doesnt come near the demented chaos of last years Project X (which I described at the time as ""Girls Gone Wild meets Black Hawk Down"") but then again what does? 21 and Over was written and directed by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore who wrote The Hangover so they know a thing or two about raunch and they know a thing or two about story; what made The Hangover work so well was in part its odd mystery-genre structure. They try for a bit of the same in this new film in that our heroes spend much of the film trying to find JeffChangs house but a bunch of guys looking for a house isnt a mystery or at least not an interesting one. At the end of the film when they piece together the clues to finally discover where the house had been all along you may find yourself surprised to discover the movie was supposed to even have a story. More importantly and more fatally the raunch itself isnt all that nutty either. Sure theres a teddy bear glued to genitalia theres an elaborately grotesque nod to Eyes Wide Shut there are surreal party scenes galore not to mention the aforementioned cascade of dude nudity (dudity?). But its all so lifeless. Even some of the actual laughs feel obligatory like the result of a sense-memory of superior raunchfests like The Hangover and Superbad and even Project X  than anything this movies achieving on its own. The overwhelming vibe you get is that of someone straining to outdo those films and failing. In the end 21 and Over is more exhausting -- and exhausted -- than funny or wild.

That may be true but there is a bigger theme here After four years of college lifelong friendships can become forced resulting in awkward attempts to reconnect and relive the good old days.Not that the second point is explored with much depth in this movie about an odd couple -- the motor-mouthed self-involved Miller (Miles Teller channeling a 1980s John Cusack) and the Wall Street-bound straight arrow Casey (the charming Skylar Astin) -- who surprise their old pal Jeff Chang (Justin Chon) with a visit on his 21st birthday. Debauchery is expected for such a milestone but these guys get into more trouble in one night than members of this films target audience will encounter in their entire college lives. Photo Partying nonstop in ""21 amp; Over"" are from left Miles Teller Skylar Astin Sarah Wright and Justin Chon. Credit John Johnson/Relativity Media ""21 amp; Over"" the directorial debut of the ""Hangover"" screenwriting team Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (responsible for the script here too) follows Miller and Casey as they embark on the not-so-herculean task of getting a passed-out Jeff home before an early-morning interview for medical school. (Their efforts include playing beer pong sneaking into a sorority and offending anyone who isnt a straight white guy.) All the while two mysteries lurk Why does Jeff have a gun? And how in the world did these guys become friends in the first place?The one relationship with a bit of spark is between Casey and Nicole (the spunky Sarah Wright) a student the friends meet at a bar. But the filmmakers are more interested in projectile puking and bigoted remarks (flying out of Millers mouth with a wink of course). The movies humor -- at the expense of Asians Latinas and even Serbs -- comes off just as tone deaf and random as Seth MacFarlanes Oscar-night shenanigans.""21 and Over"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Backsides are spanked a tampon is eaten and a teddy bear is abused. 21 and Over Directors Jon Lucas Scott Moore Writers Jon Lucas Scott Moore Stars Miles Teller Justin Chon Jonathan Keltz Sarah Wright Rating R Running Time 1h 33m Genre Comedy Movie data powered by IMDb.com Last updated Mar 30 2016 Opened on Friday nationwide.

If youre still optimistically blowing that horn this will plug it ""21 amp; Over"" a collegiate comedy apparently aimed at a fresh new generation of bigots. Misogynists and homophobes too. But first things first. Writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore make their directorial debut with this younger-skewing repeat of their bad-boy comedy ""The Hangover."" On the eve of a med-school interview stressed-out Jeff Chang (Justin Chon) toasts his 21st birthday with straitlaced Casey (Skylar Astin ""Pitch Perfect"") and wild-man Miller (Miles Teller 2011s ""Footloose"").

Not inherently but Miller our supposedly lovable loudmouth affectionately refers to Jeff with an Asian slur mocks his driving (""Are your eyes open right now? I cant tell"") and always calls him ""Jeff Chang"" as if the surname is the funny part. As a result the scenes of Jeffs body being dropped thrown and defaced feel a little dehumanizing. Hes a mere prop like the baby that Zach Galifianakis carried around in ""The Hangover."" Jeff is in fact repeatedly called ""the baby."" ""21 amp; Over"" doesnt stop there. It also gives us a sorority full of butchy Latinas two Serbian thugs (at a college?) and one glancing reference to ""you Jew."" The worst treatment is saved for women who are useful mainly when the guys need to wedge a shot-glass somewhere. And only a man would dream up Caseys glittering prize Nicole (Sarah Wright) a chesty flirt with a lollipop fixation. All or at least some might be forgiven if there were just one likable character or memorable joke. advertisement | advertise on newsday Well at least ""21 amp; Over"" doesnt mock black people.

By Amy Nicholson Mar. 01 2013 In Miles Tellers screen debut the Very Serious drama Rabbit Hole he manslaughters a toddler and weeps on Nicole Kidmans lap. In the opening shot of his latest the seriously fun 21 amp; Over he struts across a college campus naked except for the Anthony Kiedis-style tube sock on his dick. Ladies and gentleman a star is born. Miles Teller has the commitment of Daniel Day-Lewis the crazy of John Belushi and the aura of the second-string high school quarterback you couldnt decide if you wanted to kiss or punch in the mouth. (Cmon fellas search your soul and youll secretly agree.) Oh--and Footloose proved he can dance. En route to conquering the world the 21 amp; Over star is in the surprisingly confident hands of first-time directors Jon Lucas and Scott Moore the writers of The Hangover and the heartbreakingly underrated The Change-Up. Lucas and Moores aged-down bro-down is like if the Hangover trio took a Delorean back ten years to revive their friendship before it had to add Zach Galifianakis for spice. Miles plays Miller the Lacoste visor-wearing instigator who totes his increasingly bourgeoisie high school best friend Casey (the deceptively normal Skylar Astin of Pitch Perfect) to surprise their third BFF Jeff Chang (Justin Chon) on his 21st birthday. Alas Changs dad (the Walkenishly stern Francois Chau who growls ""dickheads"" like its an ancient samurai curse) is in town to make sure he nails his 8 AM med school interview. Naturally ten minutes into the movie the birthday boy is what the kids say krunked. Drunk Jeff Chang is a demonic Pokemon. The biggest thing to-date on (31-year-old) Justin Chons credits is playing one of Bellas classmates in Twilight but Chon can expect to get at least three good years of fame from being the guy who chews and swallows a brand new tampon in a single-take close-up that could have gotten him a supporting Oscar nom if hed also cut his hair and sang. Too soon however - but not too soon for a 30-second slow-mo vomiting scene - hes comatose forcing his just-visiting friends to drag his body around campus to find out where he lives before Daddy Dearest picks him up at 7 AM. At least the 56"" Chon weighs less than the Weekend at Bernies dudes mustache alone. Chang makes the most of scenes where hes conscious and coherent he rides a bull he dances with a teddy bear glued to his crotch he does the worlds most adorable body shot off of an obese mans belly. And thanks to a smart script move he continues to be a major character even when hes as limp as over-boiled asparagus. As Miller and Casey troll his university for clues as to where Chang lives they find that their supposed best friends life is a lot darker than hes let on over the phone - and come to think of it lately theyve been lazy about calling. Which means the three of them need to admit theyre now friends in name only. At 18 college acceptance letters roll in and it becomes clearer which of your friends are going to have a good life. Still people have four years to screw it up by dropping out drinking too much or forgetting to use a condom. At 21 the future is more in focus. Casey is headed to Wall Street Jeff Chang will obey his dads demand to become a doctor. And Miller is getting left behind. Hes got a job at the gas station gets wasted every day and refuses to take on any more responsibility than feeding his cat. Hes got nothing - and everything - to lose and Teller taps into the fearful desperation of a kid who realizes if his life hasnt already peaked it might tonight. Hes drowning his worries in cheap braggadocio and even cheaper beer but we can see them fighting to surface even if Caseys too wrapped up in his own future to notice. As their adventure stumbles on were watching the end of a friendship or at least the end of a friendship that pretends everyone is going to wind up just fine. 21 amp; Over sticks to The Hangovers formula of booze + bromance + mystery = gold. It even also works in a hot blonde love interest for the square (Sarah Wright) and an extended shot of an Asian mans weiner. But while the warped violence of The Hangover made you honestly believe someone could wind up dead 21 amp; Over powers along with a winning Abercrombie bonhomie IE naked guys and racism. Hilarious racism that is - Teller will say anything for a laugh and he gets lots of them. The jokes are so equal opportunity theres even a scene where Miller and Casey heckle two ethnic Serbs during beer pong and ask if their Miller Lite tastes like freedom - which given that the Kosovo War ended when they were 7 must have made them the best-read second-graders in America. ""You kids today. Every one of you is spoiled drunk and fat"" grumbles Jeff Changs dad - a line that will probably get cheers in the right college crowd audience. Like a sloshed Scott Pilgrim 21 amp; Over plays to the young and the nostalgically young especially when the dudes face the Tower of Power a Nintendo-esque challenge braving them to win nine classic drinking dares in a montage of quarters keg stands and suck-and-blow. Besides Mr. Chang their antagonists include a Latina sorority thats way into spanking and is responsible for one of the best make-outs in the movie - and no its not the first softcore lesbian one you see in their house - plus a Spirit Squad captain (Jonathan Keltz) and his two gleefully demented male minions Julian (Daniel Booko) and Jayden (Russell Mercado) who cheer threats like ""Hurt his feelings Randy"" Of course the biggest villain in a movie like this is maturity. And 21 amp; Over bitterly enjoys harshing its own mellow. In one scene our heroes scope out a police drunk tank where under the harsh fluorescents the fun of alcohol evaporates leaving behind scary and sad zombie husks. Kids this is your brain on Goldschlager. Worse in an earlier moment the guys decide that at 21 theyre too old for musical festivals and accept that in 10 years theyre all going to be married and boring with minivans and kids. School comedies are all about celebrating the narrow exclusionary window of youth but 21 amp; Over threatens to put its own characters in a retirement home before the credits. Guys youre never too old to like watching dumb dudes drink shots. Just take it from the 50-something stranger with a long mustache and metalhead t-shirt next to me in the theater. As the lights dimmed and 21 amp; Over began he leaned over and whispered ""This is the second time Ive seen it - its so good.""

At least thats what happens in ""21 amp; Over"" the directorial debut of ""Hangover"" writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore who prove themselves masters of on-screen debauchery while still facing a steep learning curve on poignancy. If you want to make ""Animal House"" make ""Animal House"" and if you want to make ""The Breakfast Club"" make ""The Breakfast Club."" Trying to do both is no easy feat and its one that these two first-timers fall short of accomplishing. Still ""21 amp; Over"" is a blast while the partys on. Miller (Miles Teller ""Footloose"") and Casey (Skylar Astin ""Pitch Perfect"") surprise their high-school pal Jeff Chang (Justin Chon ""Twilight"") on his 21st birthday for a wild night of debauchery. Jeff Chang (the use of his first and last names is a running gag in the movie) initially begs off since he has a med-school interview at 8 a.m. the next morning arranged by his ultra-strict Tiger Dad Dr. Chang (Francois Chau) -- but it doesnt take much to talk him into just one beer. One beer becomes two becomes shots and soon the trio are burning up the town (the film was shot in and around the University of Washington) with a spree that eventually includes vengeance-minded sorority girls; irate pep squad captain Randy (Jonathan Keltz); seize-the-day sorority girl Nicole (Sarah Wright) who catches Caseys eye; an out-of-control buffalo; and some of the most prodigious projectile vomiting seen outside of the oeuvre of John Waters. So far so good and ""21 amp; Over"" distinguishes itself from many of its gross-out peers by giving us compelling characters (the friction between the rambunctious Miller and the buttoned-down Casey provides much of the comedy) and by allowing the occasional victims of our heroes bacchanal the chance to get their revenge. Most male-privilege farces never give the other side a chance for rebuttal but Lucas and Moore are savvy enough to give us both outrageous acts and legitimate consequences without being wet blankets about it. Things do get sodden when Miller and Casey realize that Jeff Chang is perhaps more troubled than they realized which leads them to contemplate that their friendship isnt as close as it once was and that in turn prompts conversations about their lives after college and whether or not theyll all stay in touch. Theres a movie to be made about such subjects to be sure but ""21 amp; Over"" twists itself into knots trying to be wild and sweet at the same time. The parts that work however work very well thanks mostly to the three engaging leads (all of whom are subjected to full dorsal and mostly frontal nudity over the course of their adventures). There are plenty of hilarious recurring jokes involving minor characters particularly Randys unctuous yes-men. ""21 amp; Over"" provides lots of fun while the beer flows. Too bad the R.A. felt like he had to come in and ask everyone about their major. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Directors Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (132). R Nudity violence language drugs alcohol. Area theaters. How ironic (depressing? predictable?) that the week after we celebrate the best in movies we are force-fed its very worst. ""21 amp; Over"" is filmmaking by formula and evidence of Hollywoods assumption that appealing to viewers basest instincts will always pay off. Please prove them wrong. ""The Hangover"" writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore have cobbled together this junior version of their bachelor smash a wit-free celebration of all that is empty and ugly and useless. Representing all of these attributes is Miller (Miles Teller) the embodiment of the obnoxious bro that screenwriters persist in believing is hilariously charming. The thoroughly loathsome Miller has arrived at Northern Pacific University with his high school buddy Casey (Skylar Astin) to celebrate the 21st birthday of their best friend Jeff (Justin Chon). In absence of an actual plot the guys get drunk wander around campus and face forgettable obstacles. Theyll make it through the maze when they deposit Jeff back at his apartment the next morning in time for his med-school interview. Lucas and Moore dont bother to come up with a single funny joke. Instead they apparently hope that combining racist and sexist insults with unfocused mayhem will be diversion enough. Women primarily exist to be tricked spanked urinated and vomited upon at least until the boys late but well-earned comeuppance. The perpetually humiliated Chon has a thankless role but Astin manages to emerge unscathed. Its Teller an up-and-coming talent who most disappoints. He deserves better than this lowest-common-denominator entertainment. Then again so do we.

"21 amp; Over a college-campus Hangover | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMovies21 amp; Over a college-campus Hangover 21 amp; Over written and directed by Hangover franchise writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore is heavy on the gross outs and light on genuine laughs.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Feb. 28 201321 amp; OverStarring Miles Teller Skylar Astin Justin Chon and Sarah Wright. Directed by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore. 93 minutes. Opens March 1 at major theatres. 14AI liked boozy college campus blow-out 21 amp; Over21 amp; Over a lot better when it was far funnier and called Animal House.Article Continued BelowHaving crafted a winning formula by writing The Hangover (and to a lesser extent The Hangover Part II) first-time directors Jon Lucas and Scott Moore repeat the process moving the action for their new movie from honeymoon hotspots to frat houses and off-campus bars for an age-of-majority bad-taste orgy.In 21 amp; Over things star in by-the-Hangover-book fashion for this pair of gross-out comedy writing kingpins. A hapless duo wearing only athletic socks on their dangly bits the better to admire their branded and naked behinds shuffle across a public square muttering about what did -- and didnt -- happen the night before.Meet chronic underachiever Miller (Miles Teller of Footloose and similarly plotted Project X) a foul-mouthed slacker who when hes not hollering the f-word pledging to nail his friends sister or calling people ""dude"" spews racist slurs. With him is straight-laced Wall St.-bound buddy Casey (Skylar Astin of Pitch Perfect). Their mission to drop in to surprise their hardworking pre-med buddy Jeff Chang (the Twilight series Justin Chon the funniest of the trio) and usher him into the land of the legal drinkers on his 21st birthday. They never call him Jeff; hes ""Jeffchang"" a way of reinforcing the fact hes Asian. Its funny dude. Seriously.Miller and Casey may have started out determined to ""f--- you with alcohol"" for Jeffchangs coming-of-age birthday but the quest changes focus as the hour grows late and they discover they have no idea where the inebriated Chang lives. They have only a few hours to get him sober showered and suited prior to a date with a medical school admission interview with his hard-nosed disapproving father Dr. Chang (Francois Chau) at his side.If the evening is pretty much a blur for Jeffchang we know how he feels. Everything is done to excess with the needle on the gross-out meter buried in the red.Suggestions of a deeper plot where Miller needs to face up to the fact hes burned most of his friendship bridges with his childish ways and secrets about Changs darker side get sidetracked with games of beer pong and crude Hispanic jokes. If these guys were even mildly likeable these beats could have added something beyond projectile vomiting to 21 amp; Over but no audience will give a rats rear about this sorry cadre. For all the chatter from these spoiled beer-chugging losers about getting busy with women theres remarkably little sex in 21 amp; Over. Miller yammers about it endlessly while Casey does his best to make time with a pretty free-spirited student (Sarah Wright) who talks a good game in that simpering sexy baby voice so favoured by young females today. But nobody scores. Voyeurism in the manner of flashed breasts and ordering two blindfolded female sorority pledges to make out after having their posteriors paddled is what gets these guys through the night.(By the way that scene was a lot funnier when a young Kevin Bacon was hollering ""Thank you sir May I have another?"" in Animal House.)With its nasty undercurrents of racism sexism and pro-America chest-thumping where the worst thing you can call a man is a ""little bitch"" 21 amp; Over goes looking to mine gross-out comedy diamonds but ends up pawing around in a mirthless sewer.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsSquadGoals Will Smith Margot Robbie on Suicide Squad red carpet in TorontoToronto mayor John Tory showed up to thank the stars for shooting the summer tent-pole movie in the city.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 01 2013 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Mar. 01 2013 1200AM EST Comments Print /License AA 21 amp; OverDirected and written by John Lucas and Scott MooreStarring Miles Teller Skylar Astin Justin ChonClassification 14ARating StokerDirected by Chan-wook ParkWritten by Wentworth MillerStarring Mia Wasikowska Matthew Goode and Nicole KidmanClassification 14ARating Deuces are wild two movies guilty of two classic sins and worthy of no more than two reluctantly conferred stars. Each is a paragon in its own way - 21 and Over of commercial stupidity Stoker of artsy pretension. So the first sets the bar low and succeeds on both counts It is undeniably stupid and will assuredly make money. The second aims much higher only to fall short as art and probably to barely dent the box office. Our task today is to play the lesser-of-two-evils game. Which movie when all is badly said and unhappily done proves the least annoying? Multimedia 21 amp; Over The official trailer Multimedia Stoker The official trailer The dumb comedyJohn Lucas and Scott Moore the co-writers of The Hangover franchise share the directors chair in 21 and Over and taking full advantage of their promotion set out to make something totally different - The Hangover Jr. Out are the drunken middle-agers in are the drunken college students. Or to be precise two students and a dropout. Miller (Miles Teller) full of beans and foul of mouth has left school for the greener pastures of a gas station. But now hes back on campus to celebrate the 21st birthday of Chang the Asian guy (Justin Chon) - the one whose strict daddy doesnt know he sucks at math and who has a big job interview the next morning. Casey the straight arrow (Skylar Astin) is along for the ride and for the pretty girl who pops ups intermittently because thats what pretty girls do on these intoxicated sprees.Plot? The usual ""Just one beer"" escalates as a geometric progression into shots being downed pants being dropped leaks being taken vomit getting hurled sororities getting raided bottoms getting spanked culminating in the sight of a pair of dudes sauntering in the wee hours across the college square clad in nothing but a single sock worn not over its customary appendage but over the one-that-rhymes-with-sock.This is comedy on a familiar train where every stop is reassuringly predictable. Certainty then is the watchword and you can be certain of three things There will be plenty of juvenile energy to power the vehicle; there will be a few mild chuckles en route; there will be no reason to remember the ride the instant it ends.The pretentious horror flickBy contrast low-brow gives way to up-market in Stoker which boasts a genuine auteur in Korean director Chan-wook Park (Oldboy Thirst) jetting in to make his Hollywood debut and a formidable cast in emerging star Mia Wasikowska established veteran Nicole Kidman and recent Oscar nominee Jacki Weaver. Talent behind the camera talent in front and yet nothing worth watching. What happened?Well as the title broadly hints were in Bram Stoker territory here - the setting may be contemporary but everything else from look to tone is pure Gothic. To that end in a mansion atop a hill matters start with a funeral. Eighteen-year-old India (Wasikowska) has just lost her father; her mother Evelyn (Kidman) has lost her husband. Given the tension between mother and daughter they seem never to have found each other. This frees the girl to spend abundant time alone often in the ample gardens where in her high-collared dresses and her severely parted hair she poses like a piece of Victorian statuary. There in stylish close-up Park zooms in on a predatory spider crawling up her nubile leg.Foreshadowing over along comes handsome Uncle Charles (Matthew Goode) to weave his tangled web. Like those Hitchcockian uncles this one is a charmer with a dark side dark enough that the family cemetery is soon swollen with more corpses (say goodbye to Jacki Weavers cameo). Of course as in all Gothic tales violence keeps close company with sex and pretty soon both mom and daughter are vying for Charless dubious attention. Naturally India has youth on her side not to mention a genetic inheritance that makes her a chip off the uncles nasty block - the girls a dab hand with a sharpened pencil or a pair of garden shears.Meanwhile Park is busy treating every frame like a runway model dressing it up in self-conscious layers of cinematic haute couture. Its gorgeous to gaze upon but otherwise dessicated - listless juiceless and ultimately pointless. For all his exemplary camera work theres no motion or emotion in the picture.The choiceSo pick your poison. Will it be the comedy lively but real stupid or the drama beautiful but dead static? Me Im going with the tequila shots and the sock condoms and my reasoning is simply irrefutable Better to be bored silly than bored stiff.

The ""wild"" college movie ""21 amp; Over"" is aimed at those with an IQ of 21 and under but just because your comedy is dumb doesnt mean its funny. The night buttoned-up JeffChang (thats how hes referred to throughout as if repetition will make it funnier) is turning 21 he has to go to bed early because of a morning med-school interview that his domineering dad arranged. So he cant go out with his buddies the burnout Miller (Miles Teller) and the smart ambitious Casey (Skylar Astin). Well maybe for just one drink. How does that turn out? Hint The opener is Casey and Miller walking across campus each naked except for a single centrally placed tube sock. We flash back to the craaaazy story of how this nuttiness went down . . . If the setup sounds familiar or stale check the writer-directors names Theyre Jon Lucas and Scott Moore whose writing credits include (the overrated but amusing) ""The Hangover."" Dont expect as much from this one as Lucas and Moore apparently didnt have much to do with the earlier film. Says who? Says Lucas "" The Hangover was really director Todd Phillips movie . . . this [""21 amp; Over""] is more an expression of who we are"" he is quoted as saying in the production notes. You might wanna be quiet about that Jon because the movie gives the impression that you and your partner are kind of moronic. The movie is basically 90 minutes of senseless plot (how is it that after a lengthy night of pub-crawling its still early enough for a pep rally?) that does nothing except link various episodes of drinking vomiting and chucking JeffChang (Justin Chon) out of various buildings. I dont think Ive ever seen someone ralph in super-slo-mo while riding a mechanical bull before so kudos for originality there I guess. But beer is only fun to drink not to watch others drink. Whereas vomiting really doesnt qualify as entertaining either way. JeffChang (its funny cause its Asian? Would they run the names together if they were JeffJones?) passes out and the other two drag him around all night trying to figure out his address so they can put him to sleep before his morning interview. Wouldnt both pals have this info in their smartphones especially since both have already been to his house? Since all three have been friends for years wouldnt they know lots of others who would have the address in their smartphones? Wouldnt it be easier to wake up Jeff than drag him around? Couldnt they just find him a quiet place to crash until he sobers up? Instead Casey and Miller bust into a Latina sorority where Jeff is so wasted he eats a tampon. They all wind up getting chased off a high floor by an angry mob. (Jeff gets tossed unconscious onto a covered swimming pool like a toy.) Lucas and Moore keep coming up with wacky notions and leaving them dangling in the breeze like the unclothed male butt cheeks they deliver in scene after scene after scene. Wouldnt it be funny they ask if a drunk guy with a teddy bear glued to his man-parts and a bra around his chest dashed around climbing on cars? Could be. But thats just a setup. Then what? Wheres the payoff? The writers dont know. They think theyre done. They move on. Miller and Casey do a lot of bantering but nothing they say is funny because Moore and Lucas havent figured out that just typing the words ""bro"" and ""bitches"" a few dozen times isnt actual comedy. Try it yourself The weather is 42 degrees and clear bitches. Im going out to lunch bro. ""Im the mayor of Crazyville"" one of the guys proclaims.

Daily Edition Login to download 21 amp; Over Film Review 500 PM PST 2/28/2013 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Relativity Media A raucous boys night comedy that goes for the outrageous and hits it often enough. TWITTER ""Hangover"" writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moores comedy stars Miles Teller as the friend of a college student whose birthday debauchery gets way out of control. Its Animal House with a Hangover in 21 amp; Over an aggressively vulgar sporadically funny frat party of a comedy with just one thing -- well maybe two things -- on its mind. It actually might help to be under 21 to fully imbibe the spirit of devoted drunkenness and desired debauchery unleashed by this tale of an unplanned birthday all-nighter that gets a wee bit out of hand. A lot better than the similarly scabrous Project X (not to mention The Hangover Part II) this paean to youthful irresponsibility applies the right crude and rude tude to its bulging sack of gags to have the desired effect on its target audience. Jon Lucas and Scott Moore wrote the original The Hangover and in the cause of their directorial debut theyre not averse to borrowing from themselves for the basic premise of having some guys embark on a normal celebratory outing only to see it get waaaay out of control. If this ultimately comes off as a junior-league Hangover its still not such a bad thing to generate even a third as many laughs as Todd Phillips film did and its clear that directors Lucas and Moore are on very much the same wavelength as writers Lucas and Moore. PHOTOS The Hangover Stars Before They Were Famous This time the Asian guy is at the center of things. No its not Kim Jeong again but Justin Chon as Jeff Chang a diminutive college student whose two best buds from high school aim to take him out on his 21st birthday. Visiting Jeffs Pacific Northwest campus from Stanford is straight-arrow Casey (Skylar Astin) but the engine for the evening is Miller (Miles Teller) a crude motormouth with a constant line of b.s. whos got troublemaker written all over him. Goody two-shoes Jeff at first wants to bow out of the whole deal as his tyrannical father (Francois Chau) has landed him an all-important med school interview at 8 the next morning. Under unrelenting pressure Jeff agrees to go out for one beer. Its impossible not to divine what follows. As the trio makes the nocturnal rounds of college-crowd bars and nightspots the mis-behavioral highlights include some dude pissing down on a bunch of girls Jeff throwing up endlessly in ultra-extreme slo-mo while riding a mechanized bull and a hungry Jeff consuming a tampon as a snack. Early on Casey lights a certain spark with smart-mouthed blonde Nicole (an appealing Sarah Wright) and would prefer to linger but Miller relentlessly pushes their prowl further into the night until they have to somehow figure out where the essentially comatose Jeff resides so they can tuck him in before Dad rolls around in the a.m. PHOTOS 17 Cameos in Prequels Reboots and Remakes Ever-escalating the action proceeds to wherever Lucas and Moore decide the boys can get into the most trouble. Thus Miller and Casey land in a Latina sorority house where they get into some amusingly kinky initiation rites before escaping accoutered only in strategically placed socks Red Hot Chili Peppers-style. For his part Jeff has had a teddy bear firmly attached to his nether realm and the fuzzy critters eventual removal from his body counts as one of the films big gross-out moments. Through it all Casey cant help but wish he were spending these nocturnal hours with Nicole; instead he and Miller have a running altercation with her mean-tempered boyfriend Randy (Jonathan Keltz). As dawn breaks and Dads arrival draws near things get a little heavier than one might have anticipated with the characters futures all on reset in the wake of the drunken spree. PHOTOS 15 of Hollywoods Most Notable Remakes Only two months in 2013 would so far appear to be Tellers year. He amusingly runs his mouth here for nearly 90 minutes only to reveal some unsuspected vulnerability and self-awareness in the final moments -- this after the actors expertly nuanced multilayered teen-role performance in James Pondstoldts Sundance highlight The Spectacular Now (Teller is actually 26 and can still get away with playing some years younger). Astin (Pitch Perfect) is fine as his more straight-laced foil while Chon (Eric in the Twilight series) is game for the multitudinous embarrassments that befall his character.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 738 p.m. EST February 28 2013It doesnt get much more childish than this offensive humorless film.Skylar Astin left Justin Chon and Miles Teller star in the stupidly immature and inane 21 and Over.(Photo John Johnson Relativity Media)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review  1/2 out of fourStars Miles Teller Skylar Astin Justin Chon Francois Chau Sarah WrightRated R; Runtime 1 hour 33 minutes; Opens Friday nationwideDespite its collegiate setting 21 and Over is pretty much for people with an IQ of 21 and under.This inane wannabe Animal House seems to delight in offensive racial stereotypes caustic ethnic slurs and a wrong-headed tone that makes light of suicide binge drinking and gun violence.Theres nothing to recommend the stupidly immature 21 and Over ( 1/2 out of four; rated R; opening Friday nationwide). Not unless the idea of watching projectile vomit spew in slow motion for about 60 seconds sounds like a good time. If that doesnt do it theres always the sight of a guy on his 21st birthday whos so drunk he climbs up on the bar strips off his pants and urinates on an unsuspecting crowd of fellow revelers..MORE The latest film reviews from USA TODAYDirectors Jon Lucas and Scott Moore writers of The Hangover are responsible for this raucous mess that makes college life look like its intended only to churn out graduates ready for the Betty Ford Center.The story centers on college senior Jeff Chang (Justin Chon) whose overbearing father (Francois Chau) expects him to go to medical school.Enter his best pals from high school Casey (Skylar Astin) and Miller (Miles Teller) who surprise Chang on his 21st birthday coming from out of town to take him drinking to celebrate.He wanly resists their offer because of a med school interview early the following morning. But the obnoxious Miller threatens to blow an air horn outside his apartment all night if he wont hit the bars with them. Instead of telling his friend to shove off Chang relents.Once he starts drinking all manner of mayhem ensues including the aforementioned gross-out gags and a bevy of bacchanalian montages. Theres an obligatory flirtation between Casey and Nicole a vapid blond sorority girl (Sarah Wright) whose yell-leader boyfriend is one of Miller and Caseys nemeses.When Chang passes out his out-of-town pals dont have a clue how to get back to his apartment. Their quest to get him home takes them into the next day and robs them of their clothes. Along the way they have brushes with the law stage a hospital breakout and a sorority break-in and partake in a long string of drinking games. Somewhere a buffalo enters into the equation.Astin who starred in last years Pitch Perfect is a likable actor who was far more engaging in that musically centered movie. Teller who plays one of the more annoying 21-year-olds to hit the big screen managed a wonderfully nuanced performance as a sad teen who crashes into and kills a young boy in 2010s Rabbit Hole.Inexplicably the guys always refer to their pal as ""Jeff Chang"" as in ""I think we killed Jeff Chang."" Among the litany of racist jokes Miller assumes Jeff Chang is a science brainiac because hes Asian-American. Latinas ethnic Serbs and Jews are also mocked.In possibly even poorer taste is its dismissive attitude toward a suicide attempt and a long scene of Jeff Chang driving drunk and eluding the police. Few rowdy comedies are known for their responsible tackling of serious subjects but why interject them at all in a movie that just aims to be silly fun?It could be argued that this is a post-racial take on the crass comedy genre centered on youthful overindulgence in the vein of The Hangover or the Harold and Kumar movies. But the defining distinction between those films and this one is humor. Those other movies have it and 21 and Over comes up short. 6 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/VPhFcp",http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~r/UsatodaycomMovies-TopStories/~3/8VuOOw18274/,200,21andover12,21andover,usatoday
"Review 21 and Over shuns adult responsibility - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowReview 21 and Over shuns adult responsibilityThe Hangover writers now directors too manage to make their earlier creations seem sober by comparison. Their new characters are outright irresponsible.February 28 2013|By Mark Olsen Los Angeles Times Miles Teller left Justin Chon and Skylar Astin in ""21 and Over."" (Relativity Media )""21 and Over"" could celebrate that magical moment when the final barrier to adulthood falls by the wayside as the act of legally buying alcohol instantly goes from forbidden to routine. However the movie just uses the moment as a springboard to a cynical college-age ""Hangover"" redo with far far fewer fully developed characters or inventive adventures. (And thats saying something.)Rascally chatterbox Miller (Miles Teller) and somewhat more together Casey (Skylar Astin) surprise their old friend Jeff Chang (Justin Chon) on his birthday with the prospect of a night of drunken wildness more for them than him since he has a very important med school interview early the next morning. Drinks are drunk Chang vomits (in slo-mo) while riding a mechanical bull Miller and Casey are branded in a hazing prank gone awry and they cant find their way back to Changs apartment.The film traffics in a dispiriting worldview of purposeful stupidity which leads to the casual unthinking racism sexism bigotry and general blinkered perspective that is the scourge of our era of optimized search a nothing matters outside their immediate preconceived sphere.The film has a strange obsession with race the patter peppered with references to who is a what be it white Asian or Hispanic though really no blacks because that would be awkward. A large pair of fellows are even pinned as being ""ethnic Serbs."" The films ostensible villains apart from a world that doesnt always want to party are angry Latinas and an overbearing Asian father. Add to that a single character meant to combine a romantic obstacle fastidious male cheerleader and lunkhead jock all in one a he may be called Randy but he could just as easily be named Plot Contrivance.Through the course of the story it comes out that one character has been carrying a handgun (which goes off in a crowd and is then left behind). This character is failing out of school potentially violent and may have attempted self-harm. Because suicide mental health warning signs the threat of campus violence and free-floating firearms are just hilarious arent they? Late in the story a character who had been too drunk to stand walk or talk for most of the film is suddenly behind the wheel of a car. Drunk and reckless driving is such a hoot right?""21 and Over"" is the directing debut for the writing team of Jon Lucas and Scott Moore and the film is being sold largely on their participation as the writers of ""The Hangover."" It has been reported in these pages that a different version of ""21 and Over"" will be released in China with the story framed to tell the tale of a young Chinese boy who becomes corrupted by American decadence and returns to China to reaffirm his traditional values. Even such a reactionary moralistic context would be preferable to the version now crashing into American theaters which has no tangible values or value at all. This is a movie that celebrates selfishness stupidity and the mean-spirited insensitivity that goes along with it.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint A PLACE AT THE TABLE [?][?][?] out of four stars Rating PG for thematic elements and brief mild language Theater Uptown Relativity Media Miles Teller and Skylar Astin in the comedy ""21 amp; Over."" ""A Place at the Table"" is a well-reported and devastating look at hunger in rural America. Deftly combining portraits of families lacking food security expert interviews and infographics the film by co-directors Kristi Jacobson and Lori Silverbush opens eyes minds and hearts. Raj Patel author of ""Stuffed and Starved"" addresses the paradoxical link between malnutrition and obesity both signs that poor people cant afford food they need to stay healthy. Experts detail the problems connection to agricultural policy what we subsidize (commodity crop ingredients in processed foods) and what we dont (whole grains fruits and vegetables). The film also digs deep into the stories of dignified persevering often hardworking but underpaid people dependent on charity food banks for their next meal. It evenhandedly addresses Americas emotional and ideological tug of war between wishing to help the less fortunate and worrying that someone might be getting a free ride. Throughout it offers resonant landscape images of a country so fertile it could easily feed its own population abundantly if national priorities favored that outcome. 21 amp; over [?][?][?] out of four stars Rating R for crude and sexual content pervasive language some graphic nudity drugs and drinking. Here is a youth comedy that is leering offensive politically incorrect at times even disgusting and yet not a bummer. In fact those who stick with it to the end may find ""21 amp; Over"" one of the more appealing movies of the season. Written and directed by ""The Hangover"" co-writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore its brought off with a crazed chaotic energy that absolves most of its sins. To celebrate the 21st birthday of their pal Jeff Chang (Justin Chon) a workaholic pre-med student his wild-man pal Miller (Miles Teller) and buttoned-down buddy Casey (Skylar Astin) arrange a pub crawl. Knowing their friend has a crucial internship interview the next morning they promise to keep it safe and sane. He screws up He trusts them. The celebration turns into a bender of Australian proportions. Jeff Chang (he is always called by both names) drinks himself psychotic and passes out. Miller and Casey drag the limp birthday boy across the hard-partying college town in a fruitless search for his apartment. En route they run afoul of a hyperaggressive pep squad captain enrage a Latina girl gang start a buffalo stampede throw comatose Jeff Chang off two roofs and commit a hodgepodge of felonies. You root for them nevertheless because the actors are likable the mayhem is cartoonishly overblown theres a nice undercurrent of believable friendship and the pace never slackens long enough for your thoughts to turn judgmental.

For as long as cavemen have been etching fart jokes into the walls of caves women have been rolling their eyes as they didnt yet have the language tools to whip up outraged essays for Jezebel. Still given the online furor he instigated youd think beleaguered Oscar host Seth MacFarlane had invented a whole new vocabulary for crass joking. These days we want our humor edgy and fresh and intelligent but also timely and timeless and it must appeal to our deepest subconscious impulses in a way thats never ever offensive to either sex or any racial group or political party. Got it?Its hard to know what to laugh at anymore--the only guideline maybe is that well know it when we see it. And Jon Lucas and Scott Moores guy-humor extravaganza 21 amp; Over isnt quite it. 21 amp; Over in which three college guys set out for a night of drinking and they hope debauchery is filled with crude gags that almost tip into the red on the bad-taste-ometer One of its characters in a drunken stupor eats a tampon--unused thank God as this isnt a Catherine Breillat movie. The trio crash a sorority house filled with tough angry Latinas--stereotype alert One of the guys tosses his cookies while riding a mechanical bull; his puke spins into the air in slow motion a visual symphony of pearlescent beige droplets. Theres even an uptight Asian girl who plays field hockey--stereotype alert number two You can almost see the minds of the filmmakers working Someone out there has just got to take umbrage at 21 amp; Over--please.But the most offensive thing about the picture--the directorial debut of the guys who wrote The Hangover--is how inoffensive it is. 21 amp; Over pretends to take chances even as it timidly retraces the same dance steps weve already seen in movies like well The Hangover. Three former high school besties having gone off to separate colleges some three years earlier reconnect on the night the youngest of them finally turns 21. The leads are appealing enough in their hapless just-of-age way. Casey (Skylar Astin of Pitch Perfect) and Miller (Miles Teller who gave a terrific performance in Rabbit Hole and is also a veteran of another recent guys-out-of-control comedy last years Project X) show up at Northern Pacific University to surprise their pal Jeff Chang (Justin Chon of the Twilight movies) hoping to kidnap him for a night of birthday brewskis. But JeffChang--his buds long ago having merged his first and last into that catchy uniname--has an important med-school interview in the morning and his glowering doctor-dad (Francois Chau) has showed up to escort him. Somehow Casey and Miller persuade JeffChang to go out for just one little beer which will eventually lead to shots of chartreuse--or something similarly nasty--being slurped out of a really fat guys navel.Film Details 21 and Over RatingR GenreComedy Running Time93 More Info Trailer Mayhem ensues but as any woman writing about guy humor will tell you its really all about male insecurity. And 21 amp; Over definitely is about male insecurity. These kids we learn are facing big life issues Casey the sweet responsible one is getting cold feet over the cookie-cutter finance career hes headed for especially after he meets a free-spirit Breck-girl blonde (played by Parks and Recreations Sarah Wright). Miller the bright wise-cracking schemer has unbeknownst to his friends dropped out of school altogether. And the smartest if most reserved of them all JeffChang is the Asian kid who--anti-stereotype alert--is lousy at science and has no desire whatsoever to go to medical school. (The movies best line funny in a rueful way is JeffChangs response when his friends urge him to just tell his father outright that he really doesnt want to be a doctor ""Oh my God you guys that is so white."")21 amp; Over has a few mildly amusing gags as when that Latina sorority ultimately takes its revenge; the scene also addresses the homoerotic subtext of buddy comedies head-on and face-forward in a way thats surprisingly unexploitive. Like its older brothers The Hangover movies it puts lots of male humiliation right up front. (You really dont want to know how JeffChang ends up with a teddy bear Superglued to his penis.) Perhaps thats a way of leavening the purportedly transgressive humor these movies trade in--its as if the protagonists are saying ""We can be as crude as we want because really were hurting inside.""But the movie rambles in a way that dilutes any possibility of edgy discomfort. Lucas and Moore have good control over the timing within the gags; its the spaces between them that stretch out awkwardly. You cant hate 21 amp; Over and you cant laugh at it. The most you can do is just pity it for not being as outrageous as it thinks it is. And as any guy will tell you being pitied is the ultimate humiliation.Great humor even when its wrapped in intelligent bohemians clothing a la Lenny Bruce still comes from the id which means its bound to offend someone sometime. Plus its more than OK for guys to make comedies about hurting inside. But theres one hitch The movies have to be funny. That goes for allegedly female-centric movies like Bridesmaids too--if the alternative to incessant fart and boob jokes is Melissa McCarthy taking a crap in the sink Ill take the farts and boobs.Slideshow The 20 Most Tolerable Party Movies Ellen Page Kidnaps an Infant in Tallulah but She Means Well NEXT Contact Stephanie Zacharek Follow szacharek Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Sarah Wright and Skylar Astin star in Relativity Medias ""21 amp; Over"". (c) 2011 Twenty One and Over Productions Inc. By CHASE WADE cwadedallasnews.com Staff Writer Published 28 February 2013 0152 PM Updated 28 February 2013 0152 PM Jon Lucas and Scott Moore struck comedy gold when they penned the script to the overly raunchy but award-winning film The Hangover. Since then the writing duo has also been responsible for similar comedic offerings such as 2011s Change-Up.For their newest picture 21 amp; Over the pair go beyond the writers desk and take a chance behind the cameras as well serving as both screenwriters and directors for the new yet somehow familiar project.Much like The Hangover 21 amp; Over is a booze-filled debauchery-peppered feature that follows three high school friends -- Miller (Miles Teller) Casey (Skylar Astin) and Jeff Chang (Justin Chon) -- as they reunite to celebrate Changs 21st birthday. Heres the problem Miller and Caseys surprise visit just happens to be on the night before Changs big medical school interview. Does that keep them from going out? Of course not; it is college after all.The threes hasty decision leads them on a quest through each and every dive bar present in the small college scene of the fictitious Northern Pacific University (idyllically shot on the campus of the University of Washington). As the night progresses the friends find themselves in increasingly dangerous situations that include the likes of a wild buffalo an angry Latina sorority and of course a wild over-the-top party deemed the ""Tower of Power.""Keeping with Moore and Lucas familiar (not in a good way) story structure 21 amp; Over is an alcohol-fueled journey that becomes progressively more farfetched and as the films run time ticks on increasingly unwatchable.While the story may strike only one note the films leading trio delivers impressive performances. Chon acts as a virtual crash dummy as 21 amp; Over has the actor flung from a three-story window not once but twice. Teller is quite the budding comedic actor often resembling Seth Rogen or Jason Segel.At its core 21 amp; Over could be described as The Hangover Goes to College. The movie hints at deeper story lines dealing with the stresses of college and pressure from overbearing parents and the filmmakers could have gone for a less-shallow take on the ""crazy college night"" theme. Without that depth 21 amp; Over is just a buzzed besotted effort that may leave you with a moviegoing hangover.21 amp; OVER(C+) Directed by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore.

Photo John Johnson Associated Press 21 and Over review Disgusting fun 1 / 2 Back to Gallery 21 and Over Comedy. Starring Miles Teller Skylar Astin and Justin Chon. Directed by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore. (R. 93 minutes.) If youve signed a petition in the past seven days expressing outrage at the Oscar night political incorrectness of Seth MacFarlane stay far far away from ""21 and Over."" It might be best to avoid multiplexes altogether for the next two to four weeks on the chance that you mix up theaters after a bathroom break and walk in when our heroes trick two pledges at an all-Latina sorority into making out with each other. Whether that sounds like good fun or a sign of the apocalypse will influence your ability to embrace this college party comedy which treads heavily through ""Harold and Kumar"" territory with some new ground covered as well. The movie was directed by the writers of ""The Hangover"" most likely conceived when they were younger and dumber but also more fearless. Combine that with a nothing-to-lose small budget filled mostly with little-known actors and the result is uncompromising comedy. ""21 and Over"" sets the crude tone early opening with our heroes Miller and Casey (Miles Teller and Skylar Astin) looking defeated walking across a college quad wearing nothing but athletic socks covering their genitals. Flash back one day when the pair surprises high school friend Jeff Chang (Justin Chon) on his 21st birthday. Chang has a strict father and a medical school interview the next morning but he goes out anyway. Most of the movie follows Miller and Casey on a quest to get their unresponsive/hallucinating friend back to his apartment before his father shows up. Young parents in the audience may be wondering why no one dials 911 - in real life Jeff would have died tragically four or five times. Just as those parents parents probably thought the panty raid in ""Revenge of the Nerds"" should have resulted in felony arrests. ""21 and Over"" requires a suspension of both disbelief and the moral high ground. But once you accomplish those tasks there are many rewards. Writer-directors Jon Lucas and Scott Moore find a nice balance between the over-the-top high jinks and an emotional core which unexpectedly crystallizes relatively late in the movie. When the 18-year-olds who love this movie grow up it might still mean something to them. What looks like a simple journey is given ""Odyssey""-like significance by the writers. A quest to find a residential adviser at a party has allusions to Dantes nine circles of hell and ""Apocalypse Now."" Changs scene telling off the college towns various bouncers is an excellent use of montage. Throw-away jokes about smart cars ""Rocky IV"" and oversized music festivals ring true. Teller who excelled in a smaller role in the underrated 2011 ""Footloose"" remake is the standout. He possesses most of the better qualities of Jonah Hill and Ryan Reynolds although too jumpy at times. (Future directors should monitor caffeine intake.) The weakest link is Caseys love interest Nicole (Sarah Wright) who speaks and acts like a shallow mans ideal of a girlfriend - speaking in sexy repartee while rarely resembling a real human being. Much of this movies dilemma could be quickly solved with a smartphone - was the script written before that technology? And if you are bothered by 32-year-old actors playing 21 know that there appears to be more than one 11th-year senior in this movie. If theres a weighty question in ""21 and Over"" its ""are Miller and Casey the best friends ever or the worst friends ever?"" Somewhere between the scene with slow-motion puking and naked ritual branding youll forget you even asked. Peter Hartlaub is The San Francisco Chronicles pop culture critic.

If you cant imagine anything funnier than the sight of a drunk Asian-American streaking in a pink bra with a teddy bear glued to his junk thats OK neither can ""21 and Over"" writer-directors Jon Lucas and Scott Moore. The pair credited with scripting ""The Hangover"" apply roughly the same formula to a younger cast in their dumb-fun directorial debut. Promising crude straight-boy humor but delivering sensitive buddy moments and tons of male nudity this by-the-numbers gut-buster looks slick moves fast and packs enough laughs to enliven spring-break receipts and earn its helmers more work. The paradox of Americas minimum drinking age is that it requires would-be boozers to be 21 years old before theyre allowed to act like irresponsible children. Tonights the night for Jeff Chang an unfortunate Chinese stereotype (played by Korean-American ""Twilight"" actor Justin Chon) whos tired of being mistaken for a teenage girl by bouncers and even more fed up taking orders from his demanding dad (Cambodia-born Francois Chau) who expects him to follow the family tradition and become a doctor. With his two closest high-school buddies Miller (Miles Teller) and Casey (Skylar Astin) in town to celebrate the newly 21 overachiever cant resist defying authority never mind that tomorrow is the med-school interview that determines his future. For once JeffChang -- whose friends always refer to him by his full name -- wants to spend an evening worthy of a college-movie montage. And so he does flashing his ID at skeptical bouncers (and flashing a lot more at the crowd of girls at a local bar) doing shots and tossing his cookies while riding a mechanical bull. This is the stuff memories are made of -- or in the ""Hangover"" tradition the stuff wild-and-crazy characters cant remember when they sober up the next morning. ""21 and Over"" begins with Miles and Casey strolling across Northern Pacific U. naked save for a pair of strategically placed tube socks. Its the morning after the birthday festivities and the two agree never to mention what happened the night before which of course is the directors cue to replay every loony detail over the next 90 minutes. Some may wonder how Miller Casey and JeffChang ever came to be friends in the first place though the idea seems to be that college serves to redefine priorities and separate once-close bonds. Casey is the responsible one making plans for a promising internship in New York over the coming summer while Miller remains the groups instigator a role well suited to the charismatic Teller a movie star in the making who amplifies the energy of his recent ""The Spectacular Now"" role to almost oppressive ends. JeffChang has no on-campus friends to speak of which makes it tricky when he passes out drunk leaving his two inebriated pals trying to find his home. Lucas and Moore approach this quest with all the seriousness of a true heros journey putting Miller and Casey through a gauntlet of challenges to get their friend back in bed. The script operates by drunk logic relying on brisk editing and of-the-moment song choices to race past any opportunity auds might have to question the characters reasoning while allowing for such shenanigans as raiding a Latina sorority crashing a latenight spirit rally and mastering a series of rowdy drinking games in the quest to return JeffChang home. While the solution is staring them in the face all along the characters wouldnt have had such an intense opportunity to re-examine their friendship or in Caseys case discover romance courtesy of a toothy coed (Sarah Wright) whose dimples have more dimension than she does. If raunchy college comedy ""Road Trip"" was enough to launch Todd Phillips career this play-it-safe debut delivers but doesnt exactly surprise proving Lucas and Moore like their protagonists wasted but not their opportunities. 21 and OverProductionA Relativity Media release and presentation in association with SkyLand Entertainment Virgin Produced of a Relativity Media Mandeville Films production.

I didnt get it. I couldnt get it. As a person used to being reminded that not everything can be ""Citizen Kane"" that some of us just like to enjoy movies I struggled to fathom how the first fifteen minutes of ""21 and Over"" -- a proud parade of debauchery and other politically incorrect hobbies until that point and for long after -- had already provided everything this young man could want out of a motion picture. Maybe he simply craved the comfort of the tried-and-true formula in which an uptight overachiever like the one played by Skylar Astin learns to loosen up. A story in which a beer-guzzling boor like the one played by Miles Teller eventually accepts something resembling responsibility. A story in which both of the aforementioned gentlemen insist on calling their Asian-American friend (Justin Chon) by his full name. ""Jeff Chang"" they cry into the night giving every bro-dude in the audience one more patronizing nickname to call any acquaintance of a similar ethnicity as these two insist on getting our straight-A student sloshed in spite of his exceedingly strict father (Francois Chau) and an important interview looming the next morning. Maybe Viewer X could relate deeply to Tourettes-stricken protagonists on a night-long journey to salvage their awfully wasted compatriot captured in a woozy digital haze worthy of their inebriated state by writer-directors Jon Lucas and Scott Moore. Maybe he was actually something of a Lucas/Moore completist eager to take in the latest from the scribes co-responsible for ""The Change-Up"" ""Four Christmases"" ""Ghosts of Girlfriends Past"" and of course ""The Hangover"" without the success of which this might not have seen an easy greenlight and eager comparisons. Maybe he wished that National Lampoon had taken the initiative to remake ""The Warriors"" and thus found himself satisfied by the humiliation that our frequently racist leads suffer at the hands of a vengeful Latina sorority while trapped behind enemy lines. (If only ""The Warriors"" had had more tampon-munching gags...) Maybe he very much needed an outlet in which to sort out a deep-seated fondness for free-flowing bodily fluids that concurrently kept his ironic sensitivity over bodies actually touching one another in check. Maybe he was simply pressed for time and could only see one movie that condensed the familiarity of so many other party-hearty romps into 93 harried minutes. All the more sense then for Lucas and Moore to alternate every other objectively salacious scene with ostensibly sincere moments during which our leads contend with Jeff Changs increasingly apparent suicidal tendencies. The greater consideration of this gesture had to have outweighed any sense of tonal gear-grinding for this young giddy moviegoer. Maybe he was not yet of drinking age himself and relished the vicarious experience all the more for it. Maybe he had literally not seen more than a dozen movies before no more than the dregs of these past two months or suffered from some sort of amnesiac condition and felt such immediate joy at the sight of such raucous celebration that this surely had to be the peak of cinematic achievement no bones about it. Or maybe just maybe that guy was an idiot willing like so many others to repeatedly pay for the same old shenanigans and unable to recall doing so before -- even without having drunk so much as a drop. Yes surely for them the lucky few and probable many ""21 and Over"" will be the Best Movie Ever. For the rest of us though its something of a chore.

Share Tweet For all its raunchiness The Hangover was distinguished as much by its unexpectedly elegant plotting as its casts chemistry and its famous setpieces. It was like an out-of-control frathouse that happened to reside in the loveliest building on campus. The Hangovers myriad knock-offs retained its scatological enthusiasm while abandoning its underlying precision in favor of manic random wackiness. Thats especially true of 21 amp; Over though in its case the rampant stealing from Todd Phillips surprise blockbuster is at least self-plagiarism since it was written and directed by Hangover screenwriters Scott Moore and Jon Lucas. Miles Teller stars in The Hangover The College Years as a hard-partying smartass who arrives on campus on a mission to get best friend Justin Chon blackout drunk on his 21st birthday. He gets a grudging assist from Skylar Astin a meek Jewish yuppie on the fast track to a lucrative but tedious finance career. Chon is terrified of disappointing his demanding father by possibly failing to make a good impression at his med-school interview the next morning but the trios night of debauchery spirals out of control as they lumber through a punishing gauntlet of wackiness involving vengeance-crazed Latina sorority girls a stray buffalo and a stroll across campus clad only in cock-socks. The winning Chon commits to shameless physical comedy on an almost-scary level at one point greedily chewing on a tampon for the sake of a bad-taste gag but it isnt an encouraging sign that Chon 21 amp; Overs most committed and engaging character spends much of the film in various states of unconsciousness in an unintentional homage to the Weekend At Bernies films. 21 amp; Over intermittently attempts to transcend its disreputable subgenre with nods to the central trio growing apart and intimations that Chon isnt the upbeat achiever he originally appears to be. But this strange groping for maturity and substance feels out of place in a lowbrow would-be crowd-pleaser otherwise devoted to serving up its college sex-comedy cliches straight. In 21 amp; Overs creepiest most repellent scene Teller and Astin pretend to be authority figures to coerce a pair of nubile co-eds into sexual activity. This tactic meets most definitions of a sex crime but 21 amp; Over views it as good raunchy fun though its eventually punished by what the filmmakers imagine is the ultimate humiliation its demographic can envision heterosexual men forced to engage in homosexual acts. 21 amp; Over seems particularly redundant since a film already exists thats exactly like The Hangover only not as good It was called The Hangover Part II. 21 amp; Over is so slavish in imitating its screenwriters big claim to fame that it even ends by teasing a sequel to which the only sane response is a polite but firm ""Thank you no.""
