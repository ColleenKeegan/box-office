What he doesnt realise is that hes the placebo a useless figurehead used to fool the public while his controlling staff do all the work. Were this the central thread of Weitzs comedy it might succeed but this crams the screen with competing ideas and characters parodying a reality TV contest the titular American Dreamz as well as the White House. The political connection is guest judge Quaid the unwitting target of a terrorist contestant whos recruited at the whim of British host Martin Tweed (Hugh Grants Simon Cowellesque character). Mandy Moores ruthless all-American contestant and her ambitious mother (Jennifer Coolidge) also amuse but this isnt consistent in its comic tone eventually opting for a broad light mood thats at complete odds with the darker potential of its political premise.

"American Dreamz Wake Up washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On American Dreamz Wake Up False ""Idol"" Mandy Moore plays a singer who competes on a popular television talent show in ""American Dreamz."" (Photos By Glen Wilson -- Universal Studios) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday April 21 2006 Bush Cheney ""American Idol"" and the culture of terrorism -- these are the whipping boys of ""American Dreamz"" a tediously facile satire from filmmaker Paul Weitz who co-directed the wonderful ""About a Boy"" in 2002. This time however Weitzs comic instincts fail him as he takes the directors seat without brother Chris Weitz. Even his resummoning of ""About a Boy"" star Hugh Grant cant save the movie. The sophomorically liberal agenda is unmistakable from the get-go. Conservative President Staton (Dennis Quaid) has just been reelected. Feeling triumphant he decides to do something entirely new Read the newspaper This and more reading convince him that the world isnt black and white as he thought but ""gray-seeming."" When the president refuses to appear in public so he can spend more time thinking his Svengalian Vice President Sutter (Willem Dafoe) takes decisive action to drive those flagging poll numbers back up. He finagles a guest spot for the president as a judge on ""American Dreamz"" the countrys most popular TV amateur talent show run by a snotty Brit Martin Tweed (Grant). As always the veep will transmit witty presidential things to say into Statons secret ear monitor. To cut what feels like hours of exposition short the president finds himself judging two singer-finalists -- manipulative Midwestern sweetheart Sally Kendoo (Mandy Moore) and Omer (Sam Golzari) an Arabic man (his nationality isnt clear) who loves show tunes but is also a member of a terrorist cell. Quaids halting-doofus shtick doesnt even reach one-dimensional. And as Sutter Dafoes gimlet eyes bald crown and shiny forehead suggest a combination of Cheney and nuclear power plant owner Montgomery Burns from ""The Simpsons."" Hes so mean-spiritedly drawn hes almost painful to watch. Grants spin on ""American Idol"" judge Simon Cowell is blunt obvious and -- worse -- never funny. Not even ""Idol"" softie-judge Paula Abdul would find kind words for his performance. There is one positive to take away from this movie however As Omers cousin Iqbal Lebanese actor Tony Yalda is a scream. A fey and fussy nerd with no singing talent and some bizarre dance moves he dreams of appearing on Martins show. He gyrates in herky-jerky fashion in his basement room with its nightclubby decor and revolving disco ball. (""Do I look like I need pity?"" he says to Omer at one point. ) Its all too telling that he never makes Martins show. After all we wouldnt want someone funny upstaging the others. American Dreamz (107 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for profanity and sexual references.

"Paul Weitzs American Dreamz. Slate Sign In Sign Up Paul Weitzs American Dreamz. Paul Weitzs American Dreamz. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.April 21 2006 426 PM American Dreamz Hollywood takes another shot at President Bush. By Michael Agger Mandy Moore chases her American Dreamz Many of us have an American Dream to go to the movies and laugh. The new comedy American Dreamz will fulfill that fantasy for some people. Imagine George W. Bush in the White House ... and ... hes ... reading ... the Guardian. Did you laugh? You have found your movie. But wait theres a consolation round. Do you like effeminate Arab teenagers who long to sing show tunes? Then American Dreamz is also for you. Its a healthy dollop of Bush-bashing combined with a send-up of American Idol. The movie was written and directed by Paul Weitz who has spent the seven years since giving the world American Pie atoning for his cultural sins. Weitz and his brother with an assist from Nick Hornby directed a terrific manhood movie About a Boy and more recently hes written those pointed plays about the dangers of success and the hollowness of fame that successful people like to write. As a political statement American Dreamz is overly didactic and liberal in a read-too-many-blogs sort of way (SmirkingChimp.com anyone?). President Bush with his relentless calculated simplicity turns our satirists into heavy-handed hacks. Advertisement The movie can be roughly divided into three parts. First there are scenes in the White House where President Staton (Dennis Quaid) wakes up on the morning of his successful re-election wanting to read a newspaper much to the dismay of his wife (Marcia Gay Harden) and adviser (Willem Dafoe). Next were taken to the town of Padookie Ohio where the local karaoke queen (Mandy Moore) plots her way to stardom on the American Idol-esqueshow American Dreamz. Her mercenary attitude catches the eye of the shows jaded producer and host (Hugh Grant who else?). Finally theres Omer a sweet-faced Arab boy (Sam Golzari) who recently arrived in the United States from a terrorist training camp and gets picked as a contestant. All these elements collide when President Staton in the hope of boosting his approval ratings agrees to become a guest judge on the show. How much will you pay for a cheap laugh? This movie overflows with them. The physical resemblance that Marcia Gay Hardens character bears to the actual first lady is uncanny and Dennis Quaid is amusingly forthright as the Bush-like Staton. But its Willem Dafoe showing up as some unholy combination of Dick Cheney and Karl Rove who provides the most unadulterated glee. Alas this trio may look the part but the jokes flow repetitively. The Bush character is a stage-managed baby requiring constant assurance that Jesus wanted him to be president. The Cheney character whispers words into Statons earpiece that Staton then repeats etc. Funny but tired. Weitz is on much firmer ground in the American Idol scenes--a show already so campy that it resists exaggeration. Hugh Grant and Mandy Moore (playing up her wholesomeness yet again) attempt to meet as evil equals in love but the relationship comes off like a fourth-rate Fountainhead. More successful and the reason to see the movie is the pairing of Omer and his cousin Iqbal (Tony Yalda). Iqbal a budding Arab-American drag queen lives with his parents in a white and gold-plated Orange County house. When hes mistakenly passed over by American Dreamz in favor of his foreign cousin he sulkily declares that he will be Omers manager. Iqbal dreams up tableaux of cheesy excess and Omer dutifully goes out and performs them for America. The two may be outrageous caricatures but they remind you of the fascinating hyphenated America that rarely shows up on screen. This will all play well in liberal enclaves like Madison Wis. and I have already poured enough water on whats meant to be a lark but there is a final troubling assumption at the center of American Dreamz. Im more than ready to laugh at a scene that shows bearded terrorists gathered in a tent raptly watching Omer in the final round yelling ""He nailed it"" after a rendition of ""My Way."" But the scene also implies that we can charm our enemies with our glorious entertainment Why attack the country that has given you Julia Roberts? Thats a more dangerous American dream.

Hugh Grant plays the shows host. Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""American Dreamz"" with Hugh Grant Dennis Quaid Mandy Moore Marcia Gay Harden Chris Klein Jennifer Coolidge Willem Dafoe Judy Greer Sam Golzari Tony Yalda. Written and directed by Paul Weitz. 107 minutes. Rated PG-13 for brief strong language and some sexual references. Several theaters. The greatest virtue of Paul Weitzs uneven but amusing satire ""American Dreamz"" is that its crammed full of actors doing their damnedest to steal it. This makes the experience of watching the movie sort of like a game of hot potato as the focus gets grabbed and passed and moved along from one funny performance to another. After a while you dont quite know where to look. By the time all the various plotlines converge the movies lost its energy. It lacks the sharpness of another recent satire ""Thank You for Smoking"" which ticked along so smoothly that the ending took you by surprise -- you werent quite ready to be done with it. Here the straight-from-the-headlines plot is full of rich opportunities for satire but ultimately seems a little too tame. If youre going to make a comedy based on the idea of the president being assassinated by a terrorist on live television you need to be unafraid to be a little nasty. That said ""American Dreamz"" is often a lot of fun thanks to Weitzs cast. Hugh Grant plays Martin Tweed a cad with perfect diction whos host of a TV singing contest that bears a more-than-slight resemblance to ""American Idol."" (Grants basically Simon Cowell just as nasty but with a slightly better fashion sense.) The shows a massive hit a fact not lost on a troubled White House dealing with an unpopular war in the Middle East miserable poll numbers and an out-of-touch president (Dennis Quaid doing a vaguely Texas-style drawl) who doesnt read newspapers. A Svengali-like chief of staff (Willem Dafoe looking uncannily like a slightly downsized version of the current vice president) schemes to have his man connect with America by making a guest appearance on Tweeds show. Meanwhile a bungling terrorist named Omer (Sam Golzari) with dark connections and a love for show tunes finds his way onto the show as does ambitious small-town songbird Sally Kendoo (Mandy Moore bright-toothed and strangely tan). Theres a bomb an illicit affair scenes from a terrorist-training camp a Carmen Electra cameo and a lot of bad pop music. So theres plenty to toss around here though Weitzs screenplay doesnt make all of it stick. Quaids President Joe Staton for example is written as a well-meaning dope which gives Quaid virtually nothing to play. When Staton finally reads a newspaper noting ""Theres a lot of stuff in here"" it falls flat; the characters such a blank slate that the line has no meaning. Moores Sally is quickly revealed as a coldhearted schemer which makes her plotline a bit flat -- we know exactly where shes going. But many of the performances are wickedly good. Shohreh Agdashloo purrs all her lines as a sort of Arab Zsa Zsa Gabor; Tony Yalda her son and Omers performance coach prances through the movie with a brow permanently arched. Chris Klein as Sallys roadkill boyfriend taps into the dimwitted slow-blink charm he first showed in ""Election."" Judy Greer and John Cho as Tweeds harried assistants wouldnt be out of place in a 30s screwball comedy. And Grant so at home on the screen as a self-absorbed wretch (shades of Daniel Cleaver in ""Bridget Joness Diary"") brings a sort of languorous grandeur to Tweed. Sick to death of the show hes created he watches the less-talented contestants with his eyes widening in a mixture of horror and amusement. ""That was strange"" he tells one ""but rather wonderful."" In this crowded movie you keep wanting Grant back on the screen; a smug anchor in a crazily free-floating world.

Imagine that. 1 / 2 Back to Gallery American Dreamz Comedy. Starring Hugh Grant Mandy Moore Sam Golzari and Dennis Quaid. Directed by Paul Weitz. (PG-13. 107 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""American Dreamz"" is a light satire that makes fun of a nation more interested in who wins ""American Idol"" than the presidential race. But then the movie itself is more interested in satirizing ""American Idol"" than American politics an irony that probably isnt lost on writer-director Paul Weitz (""American Pie""). Its not a satire with lots of teeth nor is it one thats all gums. Under cover of innocuousness it occasionally has some bite to it. The intent here seems to be to satirize without offending -- or at least without enraging anybody. Thus we get Dennis Quaid doing a flat-out send-up of President Bush as a complete imbecile but a sweet-natured and humble imbecile with benign instincts. At the picture begins he has just won re-election and is finally getting around to taking an interest in world affairs at least enough to start reading newspapers. This distresses his chief of staff played by Willem Dafoe a Svengali figure who acts like Karl Rove but is made up to resemble Dick Cheney. From the news President Staton gleans that ""there are three kinds of Iraq-istanis"" Shiites Sunnis and Kurds and that they really ""hate each other."" This is his discovery three years into the war. Afraid that the president will start to learn more his chief of staff sedates him with ""happy pills"" and encourages him to make public appearances wearing an earpiece so he can feed him his lines. Depicting Bush as a sweet moron is a cliche that will irritate some and not completely satisfy anybody as the movie doesnt come close hitting any raw nerves except perhaps when President Staton starts to doubt if he really was chosen by God for the presidency that maybe it was all just a terrible fluke. Also askew -- not caustic enough not funny enough -- is Weitzs portrayal of an al Qaeda training camp in slapstick terms. In truth the element for satire is not that theyre bumblers or harmless. The element for satire if any is that theyre off their rockers. But Weitz recovers and gets on surer ground when he turns his attention to ""American Idol"" here known as ""American Dreamz."" (The comedy is funny even if like me youve never seen ""American Idol."") Hugh Grant who has found his niche as a superficial cad plays Martin Tweed the English-born host of the TV sensation. To maintain his shows place at the top of the ratings he tells his associates that he wants to recruit ""freaks"" for the upcoming season. His crew finds one in Orange County an Arab (an undercover Al Qaeda operative) named Omer (Sam Golzari) who cant dance and can hardly sing but who loves show tunes. He is coached for his audition by his acerbic gay cousin an Americanized Arab played with panache by Tony Yalda. The crew also finds a more conventional contestant in Sally Kendoo a girl next door from Middle America with blonde good looks an ingratiating manner and an all-consuming ambition that would put Lady Macbeth to shame. Sally is played by Mandy Moore who throughout her fairly modest film career has always been better than shes had to be. She has the capacity for playing more than one emotion at once for a kind of spontaneous moment-by-moment complexity and her range extends from tragedy to farce. Here shes a filmmakers dream taking a role that easily could have been a one-note joke and turning it into something deeper more monstrous more funny and more real. Her burgeoning connection with the older and more powerful Martin Tweed -- based on their recognition of each others fraudulence and spiritual deadness -- is one of the movies most satisfying elements. Moores also quite good in her scenes with Chris Klein as her sickeningly kind boyfriend for whom she can barely contain her contempt. ""American Dreamz"" is the rare case of a movie that gets better as it goes along heading toward a climactic scene in which the president goes on ""American Dreamz"" as a judge. Quaid is at his best here as a lost and dazed president helpless without his earpiece trying to improvise. Its the one scene in which Weitz almost takes the gloves off. -- Advisory Sexual situations and humor.

Yes any idiot can be on TV. This was established well before The Gong Show. But the contestants clawing for pop idolatry on American Dreamz are idiots of such vast dimension -- so crass and conniving and some of them cant even sing -- that they make the contestants on the real American Idol seem like Nobel Prize winners and opera stars by comparison. But American Dreamz has more on its mind than callow celebrity-lust. Weitzs film is a schmeared-thin satire of everything that clearly bugs him including terrorists agents vapid tube boobs and a certain current resident of the White House. George W. Bush gets thrashed around quite a bit here Dennis Quaid plays him (or his parodic alter-ego Joseph Staton) as a large and not entirely with-it puppy a sort of well-intended doodle who allows a Dick Cheney-like puppetmaster (Willem Dafoe) to radio-control his every public utterance. Staton who has just won a second term in office awakes one morning with a radical new idea ""Im going to read the newspaper."" So inspired he holes up in his presidential bedroom for a few straight weeks pajama-clad cloistered with stacks of printed media while the press suspects a breakdown and his handlers freak out. How to get him out of his shell? Easy. Book him as a guest judge on the championship round of American Dreamz the nations No. 1 show. Dreamz is hosted and judged by the misanthropic Martin Tweed (Hugh Grant) who might be the spawn of Simon Cowells forked tongue and Ryan Seacrests hair. Tweed oversees a crop of pop-god wannabes whose three front-runners are a funky Hasidic cantor (Adam Busch) a squeaky-blonde Ohioan sweetheart (Mandy Moore) and a show-tunes-fixated Iraqi emigre (Sam Golzari ) whos actually -- no kidding -- a terrorist with instructions to atomize the prez. Hes also -- still not kidding -- the films most sympathetic character. Most of this is mildly funny if youre in tune with the politics less so if youre not. But the politics shouldnt matter; great satire cuts fine and deep whether its slicing into the right wing or the left. Weitzs blade isnt sharp enough. It needs whetting on a hard surface. American Dreamz is just too soft. Its just too wussy despite all the Machiavellian strivers jockeying for power and an allegedly shock climax that tidies up the plot for a semicheerful ending. I got the feeling Weitzs heart wasnt in it that hes more at ease in the realm of rutting teenagers (American Pie) or ad-men in crisis (In Good Company) than this world of social and political spoofery. Even About a Boy (about another Hugh Grant cynic) showed off Weitzs real gift a gently mocking fondness for likeable screwups. Hes at his best with little human stories filled with little human beings folks struggling to define success or failure in the context of real life. In American Dreamz the people are stereotypes and the context is fake Its broad its thin its a big easy target. And ultimately its dreamz are hollow. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Wide-Ruled 70-Sheet Spiral-Bound Notebook for 17 cents +... Mens Leather Bifold Wallet with Money Clip for 3 + free...

And the most generous. It has a big head and an even bigger heart. Theres not a person to like yet we love them all. Political satire is so difficult hardly anyone tries it anymore. Its impossible to imagine how ""American Dreamz"" ever got financed. Yet here we are with a bitter and boldly beautiful movie about empty people who somehow make us feel better about ourselves. ""American Dreamz"" pulls off that rare feat of shooting at dozens of big targets and hitting so many of them that we want to stand up and cheer because someone even tried. This film may take in all of 5 million and disappear completely - its that touchy. Basing your plot on a George W. Bush lookalike a Laura Bush lookalike a Dick Cheney lookalike and a Simon Cowell lookalike and then asking us to embrace every one of their flaws is not the usual way to a blockbuster. But go see it and let yourself laugh and youll feel smarter. Kinder and gentler too. Paul Weitz co-writer of ""About a Boy"" and writer-director of ""In Good Company"" has a knack for doing that to people. In ""American Dreamz"" Weitz writes and directs a sprawling story touching on everything from Pakistani terrorist camps to the American obsession with self-improvement. Be all you can be and dont forget to look into the monitor would be the universal slogan. Hugh Grant plays Martin Tweed the host of a wildly successful ""Idol"" copy called ""American Dreamz."" He dismisses a kindhearted girlfriend with a typical Weitz line hovering precariously between aggrandizement and abasement ""You make me feel like being a better person. And Im not a better person. Im me."" Prospective contestants include Sally Kendoo (Mandy Moore) for whom fame is the goal and talent is a mere utility for achieving it. Kendoo? Yes she can. There is Omer (Sam Golzari) a bumbling Iraqi terrorist who lost his mother to a stray American bomb. He consoles himself with show tunes played on a Donny amp; Marie commemorative turntable. Can satire ever stay ahead of our insane reality? Contestant No.3 is a Jewish cantor (Adam Busch) turned blinged-out singer. Did Weitz already know Matisyahu would become a Hasidic MC? Meanwhile Dennis Quaid plays a clueless recently re-elected president bearing uncanny resemblance to a certain W. President Statons every public utterance is controlled by Cheney-esque Willem Dafoe. But Staton wants to learn suddenly asking his butler if it might be possible to get his hands on a copy of The New York Times. His bumbling syntax is punctuated by the kind of unassailable human insight that periodically helps Bush drive liberal detractors to distraction. How do these plots merge? Implausibly. Ridiculously. Sublimely. The president will boost his ratings by becoming a guest judge on ""Dreamz."" Our sleeper-cell terrorist will make it to the finals and ""kill the head of the great serpent"" while singing ""My Way."" Its almost as crazy as Americans being more interested in a glorified-karaoke TV show than a presidential election. Working on this huge canvas Weitz never neglects the small touches. The tent-camp terrorists tape ""Dreamz"" on TiVo and call in their votes on bulky sat-phones. The Jewish rapper consoles himself with a glass of Manischewitz instead of Courvoisier. The Iraqi immigrant asks his American cousins ""Didnt we just go to the mall last weekend?"" and the question hangs briefly in the air. Now thats subversive. Weitz makes it all work because he gives every caricature a handful of humane gestures. In ""Crash"" the filmmakers took popular actors and had them say evil things. Weitz takes popular actors and has them say obvious things. Some viewers will find insight even more disturbing than racism. Four stars? I know call me deluded. But I have a dream that Americanz are big-hearted and smart enough to appreciate this movie for what it is. ""American Dreamz"" is about the U.S. in all of uz.

"Sweet dreamz - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Sweet dreamz Maybe too sweet. This satire on the right targets but pulls its punches By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  April 21 2006 American Dreamz"" is a political satire thats eerily emblematic of the moment were living in smart spring-loaded with pop culture references and far too good-natured to do any lasting damage.Real satire -- like Dr. Strangelove"" or Network"" or The Manchurian Candidate"" -- leaves an audience checking itself for wounds. Paul Weitzs effervescent farce by contrast plays like the Cartoon Network version of Robert Altmans Nashville"" and for all the films shallow daring -- not to mention gleeful generous performances from a cast clearly having the time of their lives -- it never leaves any blood on the floor. The movies a perfectly fun Tinker Toy.Weitzs two biggest conceits -- that an American Idol""-style reality show could bring out the worst in a culture and that our president could be a genial pinhead controlled by White House insiders -- aint exactly fresh groceries. Still American Dreamz"" pitches its softballs with style. Martin Tweed the preeningly heartless British host of the title TV show just may be the great comic role that has always eluded Hugh Grant. If Simon Cowell had in fact sold his soul to the devil (the jurys still out) Martin might be the result.Similarly only a savvy actor like Dennis Quaid could so slyly time the pauses between misfiring neurons that characterize the thought processes of Joe Staton the US president who suggests a faithful but not terribly bright golden retriever. Staton awakes the morning after reelection and decides to read the newspapers for a change; what he learns there amazes and confounds him. Theres three kinds of Iraqis"" he informs his chief of staff (Willem Dafoe dancing merrily through the movie with Dick Cheneys glasses and chrome dome). You knew about this?""The events that bring the reality-show host and the head of state together are many and engagingly messy. For the latest season of American Dreamz"" Martin orders his minions (John Cho and Judy Greer) to bring me some freaks"" and they readily oblige. From Padookie Ohio comes Sally Kendoo (Mandy Moore) a Britney bottle-blonde whose eyes narrow with pleasure at the thought of eviscerating the competition. From Orange County by way of Afghanistan comes Omer (Sam Golzari) a saucer-eyed apprentice terrorist more than happy to forget glorious martyrdom for a chance to sing The Impossible Dream"" on national TV.Making fun of Islamic terrorists is about as dangerous as Weitz gets here and the satire might sting if the jihadists werent such silly old bears extras with glued-on beards. Still a shot of Omers sleeper-cell members sitting in his extended familys hot tub is almost worth the price of admission as are all the performances by the actors playing the flush-with-success Rizas. In particular Tony Yalda as Omers queen-bitch gay cousin Iqbal and Shohreh Aghdashloo coming on like a mischievous Arab Mrs. Robinson as Omers aunt pocket the movie whenever theyre onscreen.They have competition -- at times American Dreamz"" is as crowded as an opening episode of The Apprentice."" In Sallys corner is her sweet dim Iraq-vet boyfriend (Chris Klein) of whom she says Every time he smiles I want to hit him with my shoe."" Marcia Gay Harden channels Laura Bush as the first lady -- fish-in-a-barrel stuff this -- while Adam Busch plays a contestant whos a rapping cantor. In general the reality-show segments get their laughs without being noticeably more bizarre than whats already on American Idol.""Similarly with the political humor although Quaid makes the president almost touching in his desire to form a complete sentence on his own and Dafoe really should do comedy more often it seems to clear his pores. Youll find more trenchant potshots on The Daily Show"" though and if that makes a depressing case for the current state of satire I mean it to.American Dreamz"" tries to wind it up big with all the characters and agendas coming to a head on the climactic show. If Weitz lacks the finesse (or the right editor) to pull it off at least he doesnt spoil the vibe he has established; the movie stays true to its cheerful tastelessness.At the same time youre aching for American Dreamz"" to go a little crazy to risk the cauterizing comic anger that blasts assumptions and frees minds. At one point Omer innocently asks Are Americans to blame for America?"" Thats a question with more levels than a shopping mall. Weitz lets it lay though. Hes content to tickle our ribs here and you want to tell him The hell with that -- make us hurt.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

Or is it? The country is at war and the masses are being distracted by a TV singing competition a la American Idol. Terrorists are both repelled and seduced by American pop culture. And the good ol boy president is not much of a reader and less of a speaker. But the movie conceived by writer/director Paul Weitz (About a Boy) has a dogged sense of hope amid its broad humor. It doesnt wholly succeed as a sharp-tongued satire but its farcical elements hit their mark. The recently re-elected president is chafing at being the clueless puppet of a power-mad chief of staff. Dennis Quaid plays the Bush stand-in with aplomb and a degree of sympathy. Willem Dafoe is slyly funny and unrecognizable as a scheming Dick Cheney clone. Other standout performances include Marcia Gay Harden as the first lady and Hugh Grant as Martin Tweed the smarmy host of American Dreamz a musical reality show. Grants character a self-absorbed amalgam of American Idols Ryan Seacrest and Simon Cowell has some of the movies best lines. When his girlfriend announces that shes leaving him hes too preoccupied with the shows ratings to let her rejection register. His assessment parodies the classic Jack Nicholson line in As Good As It Gets ""You make me feel like I should be a better person"" he explains lamely. ""And Im not a better person."" His female counterpart is Sally played by Mandy Moore a scarily ambitious self-involved singer who is just a notch above trailer trash. She rises to the final ranks of the TV contest dumping her lovelorn boyfriend (Chris Klein). Glumly he decides to go off to war. Grant and his American Dreamz staff fairly salivate at the possibilities of an on-air marriage proposal between Americas singing sweetheart and her war veteran beau. The ensemble comedy has several subplots and one centers on Omer (Sam Golzari) a reluctant Arab terrorist who loves show tunes above all but is sent by a terrorist cell to wreak destruction in the USA. Not as incisive a political commentary as Thank You For Smoking American Dreamz lampoons the publics appetite for mindless entertainment and easy distraction from serious concerns. Posted 4/20/2006 945 PM ET E-mail | Print | Enlarge Universal Studios Sound familiar? Hugh Grant left Sam Golzari Mandy Moore and Adam Busch are part of a wildly popular TV singing contest.

Alas ""American Dreamz"" is not that film. Not even close.Hugh Grant plays the appropriately named Martin Tweed the unctuous British host of the ""American Idol""-ish smash ""American Dreamz."" Tweeds face is creased in a perpetual smirk; he wears his self-loathing which is indistinguishable from self-satisfaction like a lizard skin.His counterpart is Dennis Quaids President Staton who has just won reelection. For the first time in four years he decides to read the newspaper an act which tailspins him into a depressive funk. He sits around all day in his pajamas until his chief of staff (a baldpated Willem Dafoe looking like Dick Cheney) comes up with the brainstorm of booking Staton as a guest judge on the presidents favorite TV show - you guessed it ""American Dreamz."" Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? This is just the beginning. Writer-director Paul Weitz (""American Pie"" ""About a Boy"") is by no means without talent but his reach far exceeds his grasp here. If he had kept the film focused on Tweed and the president he might have scored a few lampoonish moments. But he also works in a pair of competing ""American Dreamz"" hopefuls the gimlet-eyed Midwestern crooner Sally Kendoo (Mandy Moore) and Omer (Sam Galzari) an Arab terrorist recruit with a taste for show tunes. Omers sleeper cell has plans to assassinate Staton on the studio set. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Weitz doesnt have the chops for satire let alone black comedy. For one thing shows like ""American Idol"" already do a very good job of making fun of themselves. Its possible to make a political black comedy that mixes blood with slapstick - both ""Strangelove"" and ""The Manchurian Candidate"" did it - but to pull it off you need a comic vision and not just a joke book.The Arab stereotyping - including most flagrantly Omers gay relative Iqbal (Tony Yalda) who aches to be on TV - is not pretty. And the thinly disguised jabs at President Bush - Staton even apologizes for Iraq in front of the TV audience - are so inept that you might think Karl Rove had a hand in all this as a covert way of drumming up sympathy for our president. If Weitz really wanted to satirize the current administration he did himself no favors by portraying everybody as bumblers. Its not the bumbling that drives opponents crazy; its the well-honed insidiousness.Is Weitz saying that all the worlds a sound stage that politics and show business have become indistinguishable? If so he doesnt go nearly far enough. What he doesnt fully comprehend is that the techniques of political discourse are now virtually indistinguishable from the way that the Hollywood public-relations ma-chine works. The whammo hard-sell the feel-good photo-ops the co-option of the press for favorable coverage - it all bears the heavy imprint of the marketeer mentality. Maybe Weitz cant see the real story here because hes too much a part of Hollywood. Those designer sunglasses can blind you.

"American Dreamz | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; american-dreamz ) American Dreamz (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli Is it possible to satirize something that in and of itself often crosses the line into self-parody? Thats a question that American Dreamz attempts to address. The objects of Paul Weitzs lampoon are two ripe ones American Bush and American Idol. The problem is that the TV show lives its week-to-week life a hairs breadth from outright camp and the Bush administration often seems more like a send-up of ruling the country than an actual government. Given these considerations one has to acknowledge the difficulties facing writer/director Paul Weitz (American Pie About a Boy). While he manages to land a few solid punchlines that result in decent laughs the production as a whole comes across as a soft-sell that never delivers with the force it should. One of my sources of dissatisfaction with recent satires is their unwillingness to go for the throat. Because they dont want to offend anyone they stumble around trying to attack without being vicious. This is the approach used by American Dreamz which pads its jabs at subject matters that could stand up to a lot more corrosive derision. The film is an exercise in compromise lambasting American Idol without turning off the shows fans (who presumably will make up a significant portion of the audience) and taking genial potshots at President Bush that dont result in a Republican protest. The take-no-prisoners approach of Wag the Dog is sorely missed. Another flaw is that the film arguably tries to do too many things. Satires about politics and the government could easily encompass the scope of an entire motion picture as could a parody of reality shows in general and American Idol in particular. By cobbling both together into one movie theres a sense that both lose out. And although the diverse storylines are brought together at the end they represent an uneasy marriage before that point. The two-pronged story begins with would-be contestants of the hit TV series American Dreamz getting the news that they will be featured on the new season. One of these is Sally Kendoo (Mandy Moore) a bubbly blonde who has all the makings of a star - shes pretty lively and can carry a tune. The shows producer/host/talent judge Martin Tweed (Hugh Grant) is immediately captivated seeing not only a potential pop star but a like-minded individual. Another contestant is Omar (Sam Golzari) a member of an Arab terrorist cell. Meanwhile President Staton (Dennis Quaid) begins his second term in office by reading a newspaper for the first time and questioning his policies. He goes into seclusion to catch up on current events and rumors of a nervous breakdown circulate. His popularity nosedives. Eager to repair his boss image Chief of Staff Sutter (Willem Dafoe) books the President as a guest judge on American Dreamz. When Omars keepers find out about this they order him to blow up himself and the President on live TV. No one in this film tries to hide who their real-life counterparts are. Hugh Grant has Simon Cowell down to a (black) ""T"" (shirt) from his wardrobe to his stinging assessments of contestants failures. Grant is one of those actors who can play nasty as effectively as nice and this is one case in which he puts a strong emphasis on the former. Mandy Moore essays just about every blond American Idol contestant whose smile hides a ""win at all costs"" disposition. Dennis Quaid does his best George W. Bush imitation. It includes plenty of ridicule but is also oddly sympathetic. And Willem Dafoe has a nice turn as the Dick Chaney-inspired Chief of Staff although (with apologies to the actor) a significant portion of the credit for this performance goes to the makeup staff. The least effective aspect of American Dreamz is the time it spends with Omar and his wacky terrorist brethren. Aside from the first scene which gives a glimpse into a terrorist training camp run by the Three Stooges theres little to laugh about in this subplot. Irony may be clever or amusing but its rarely funny. This is the case with Omars story its ironic that an undercover terrorist who cant sing or dance makes it to the finals of a TV talent contest but it isnt funny. Movies like this succeed or fail based on how frequently and loudly the jokes make viewers laugh. And although American Dreamz has its moments the humor is neither consistent nor inspired. I suspect devoted fans of American Idol will find more in-jokes than I did but Im not sure even those will be enough to tip the balance. This movie seems better suited as cable or video fare than for theatrical viewing. The comedy while not invisible is too limp to justify a full price admission ticket.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Self-Parody The clumsy farce American Dreamz takes a swing at some worthy targets but ends up flat on its face. By David Edelstein Published ShareThis (Photo Glen Wilson/Courtesy of Universal) Paul Weitzs politics-showbiz parody American Dreamz suggests that the biggest problem facing satirists today is that they cant begin to compete with whats happening in Washington Iraq Afghanistan New Orleans or even the sleazy corridors of network TV. Consider the reality the fourth amendment in tatters; carnage in Iraq; a potential U.S. nuclear strike on Iran; Simon Cowell as an arbiter of taste. Its so much wilder than it is in Dr. Strangelove or Wag the Dog let alone in this spottily funny clown-show which is dwarfed in its insights (and its laughs) by even a bad day on The Daily Show. The movie does begin with a good farcical premise To win back the public George W. Bush (or his alter ego Staton played by Dennis Quaid) signs up as a guest judge on the finals of American Idol (or its stand-in American Dreamz) which is presided over by a smarmy (and cruel) ringmaster Tweed (Hugh Grant). But Weitzs naivete comes out in how the president gets to the program. The morning after Statons slim reelection he decides (for no particular reason) to read a newspaper. Although hes a dimwit his eyes are opened by the complexity of issues his administration has hitherto painted as black and white and he holes himself up in his White House bedroom with more newspapers (even Canadian ones) magazines and scholarly tomes. To the horror of his Rovian handler (Willem Dafoe with a chrome dome) he realizes that hes out of touch. Now no matter what you think of our president his ignorance is willed his messianism is unshakable and he has never questioned his fitness for his job. American Dreamz is reminiscent of Charlie Varons hilarious but pie-eyed one-man show Rush Limbaugh in Night School which posits the theory that if Rush were just exposed to you know real working-class immigrants in all their tremulous humanity hed become a born-again liberal. How touching the way some lefties (especially showbiz lefties) cling to the idea that self-interest is but a fragile thing. Of course liberal epiphanies do provide them with stirring climaxes as their heroes put themselves on the line for their newfound ideals. That happens here but at least there are good bits along the way. I hooted at Tweeds insults (delivered by Grant with acid aplomb) and at the parodies of American Idol singers with their overscaled finishes and cornball Vegas air-sculptingalthough once again how can you top the original? Weitz is no stumblebum. For all the critical derision his American Pie (co-directed with his brother Chris) was a riotous depiction of adolescent-male sexual anxiety and the brothers adaptation of Nick Hornbys About a Boy was an elegant piece of storytelling. Its too bad that without his brother Weitz has too few colors on his palette. Most of his jokes hinge on camp incongruity like the Iraqi terrorist-in-training Omer (Sam Golzari) who in his tent on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border capers to Broadway show tunes. Omers fellow fundamentalist soldiers ship him off to America to be a one-man sleeper cell they never intend to wake up but when he wins a (novelty) spot on American Dreamz they direct him to blow himself up in proximity to the president. It saps the movies energy when Omer has pangs of conscience. But then everyone else has pangs too including Omers fiercely ambitious chief competitor Sally Kendoo (Mandy Moorewho has a lovely flexible voice and seems altogether too seasoned to be a plausible contestant). To keep his satirists street cred Weitz chases the sentimentality with sour slaps at the audience. But for all its supposed outrageousness American Dreamz has a soft center. Its shallow cynicism combined with its faith that everything will turn out okay can even be said to breed complacencythe opposite of what satire needs to do in these increasingly dark days. Little turns out well in Rebecca Dreyfuss Stolen a haunting and expansive documentary about the search for the precious paintings stolen in 1990 from Bostons Isabella Stewart Gardner museum. Dreyfus keeps returning to Vermeers The Concert and in between detective scenes and rather longish exchanges between Mrs. Gardner (read by Blythe Danner) and art critic Bernard Berenson (read by Campbell Scott) she interviews highly emotional Vermeer experts who describe how the artist captures a fleeting moment so exquisitely that The Concert transcends time. It does not however transcend greed The art thieves we see look like boorish macho businessmenindelibly ugly. At the center of Stolen is a man whose ugliness is only skin-deep the steadfast art investigator Harold Smith whose face has been eaten away (literally) by a virulent skin cancer. What an object for a film about the loss of great art. With his Magritte bowler eye patch and false nose he cries out to be painted by a master. American Dreamz Directed by Paul Weitz. Universal.

A demonstration of how satire can booby-trap best intentions Paul Weitzs ""American Dreamz"" responds to a host of post-9/11 issues and pop-culture phenomena with frantic miscalculation. Combining a gallery of targets including President Bush ""American Idol"" the Iraq War and the overarching theme of a nation of citizens held in the thrall of phony dreams pic and its ambitions are undermined by insistent cartoonishness and comic ineptitude. Tapping into the zeitgeist and a moviegoing public are far from the same thing which inevitably flatlining B.O. and ancillary will bear out. The idea of mixing and matching a recently re-elected incompetent prez (Dennis Quaid) with a reality show that pits aspiring pop singers against each other and is hosted by a smirking Brit (Hugh Grant) must have seemed terrif on the page. And with Weitz combining the stars of his previous two seriocomedies (Grant from ""About a Boy"" and Quaid from ""In Good Company"") while channeling issues and pop obsessions pic would appear to have more than enough meat for topical skewering. Grants Martin Tweed impresses as a ratings barracuda who will let nothing get in his way of his show ""American Dreamz"" which tops the Nielsen charts. Three thousand miles away Quaids President Staton is depressively bedridden despite his electoral victory and theres nothing the first lady (Marcia Gay Harden) or his intrusive chief of staff (Willem Dafoe) can do to shake him out it. Most disturbing to Dafoes micromanaging worrywart is that Staton suddenly wants to read the paper and learn about the world. Perhaps if the pic had focused primarily on these two leading men of Hollywood and Washington each powerful in different ways a steadier comic tone could have been found. But Weitz is out for a panorama of American life and spreads his attention to include Sally Kendoo (Mandy Moore) a young Midwestern gal with star ambitions; and Omer (Sam Golzari) a terrorist recruit with a taste for show tunes whos assigned to a sleeper cell residing in the O.C. ""American Dreamz"" gradually becomes four movies all vying for attention with the fourth being the most unwieldy. Adjusting to life with his upscale Arab-American relatives (including Shohreh Aghdashloo as the maternal Nazneen) Omer discovers Nazneens gay teen son Iqbal (Tony Yalda) shares a love for Broadway and desperately wants to be on Tweeds show. As the various narrative strands are messily curled twisted and knotted not only do the unlikely ""American Dreamz"" show finalists come down to Sally and Omer (ushering in some of the most starkly misjudged stereotypes of Arab characters in any recent Hollywood movie) but Staton wishes to serve as a guest judge on the season finale -- even as Omers cell plans to kill him on the studio set. Billy Wilder may have been able to make sense of this but the twin challenges of taking cheeky swipes at such difficult and horrific issues as domestic terrorism while juggling a vast array of types overwhelms Weitzs better sensibilities. Comic moments fall flat even as most of the cast emerges from the confusion quite respectably. Grant has seldom been more dislikable yet its this desire to smudge his own carefully built persona that makes the perf interesting. Quaids Bushlike Staton is a lonely and confused man facing the limits of his own view of the world. Moores is a pitch-perfect study of a woman for whom a reality show is reality. A bald-pated Dafoe cleverly fuses Dick Cheney and Karl Rove as he scampers about the White House bedroom (the Oval Office is never seen) and Harden with little to do suggests a caring Laura Bush. Coolidge Aghdashloo and Greer are wasted in underwritten roles. Arab activists eyeing stereotypes in Yank pop culture will have a field day with perfs of Mideast characters. Production package is surprisingly average given the talents of d.p. Robert Elswit composer Stephen Trask and production designer William Arnold. In what may be a nod to topical 70s filmmaking Elswit opts for a flashing technique that recalls vintage Vilmos Zsigmond. American DreamzProductionA Universal release of a Depth of Field production.
