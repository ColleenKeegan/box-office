This debut for helmer and vid vet Dewey Nicks and scribe David H. Steinberg a feverishly naughty revenge comedy is awful and subversively spunky at the same time. The pic has an outside chance for cult status. As cheap and rowdy as a dorm beer bash ""Slackers"" is unrestrained by the conservative filmmaking techniques of the corporate teen-gross-out product line. In ways that defy measurement this debut for helmer and vid vet Dewey Nicks and scribe David H. Steinberg a feverishly naughty revenge comedy is awful and subversively spunky at the same time. The pic has an outside chance for cult status and vid business should be fierce. Forty-eight days before graduation from Holden U. longtime buds Dave (Devon Sawa) Sam (Jason Segel) and Jeff (Michael Maronna) are biding time between con jobs. A slightly strange jump-cut-filled opener backed by a version of the Whos ""Baba OReilly"" reset to an Aaron Copland temperament establishes these hijinks as not quite your typical youth pic and illustrates that the trio already shares a masters degree in the art of getting over. Sure that he has outwitted the system Dave is planning to cheat on a class final but hasnt figured on the borderline insanity of Ethan (Jason Schwartzman) whose unhealthy infatuation for Daves neighbor Angela (James King) leads him to discover the cheating scam. Ethan confronts the guys with a bit of blackmail He wants them to set him up with Angela or else hell go to college officials with proof of their scheme. Angela is every fresh-scrubbed American boys image of the good gal -- pretty but not threatening and so nice she volunteers five days a week. Shes the polar opposite of obnoxious Ethan who cant descend a staircase without stumbling and whose shrine to Angela creepily contains a doll made from carefully collected strands of her hair. Gathering data on Angela Dave poses as a census worker at the home of Angelas parents (Sam Anderson and Leigh Taylor Young appearing embarrassed) and ends up being sexually serviced by her randy mother. Ethan employs his own disastrous methods for cozying up to Angela including posing as a volunteer hospital aide and ending up providing comfort to a topless elderly patient (Mamie Van Doren appearing quite unembarrassed). Naturally Dave trying to be matchmaker falls for Angela. The machinations of whos in with Angela and whos out take their predictable course but thats not what matters about ""Slackers."" Underneath the surface genre business which pic obeys unerringly is an anarchic sensibility true to the wildest collegiate impulses. Cutaways to goofy fantasy and nightmare montages and multiple asides (Sams nasty exchange with a game Gina Gershon in an uncredited turn a credited Cameron Diaz getting it on with Ethan in Daves bad dreams) suggest a combination of throwing ideas against a wall and a desire to further push the limits of gross-out movies. Because Sawa is so plain but blandly likable Schwartzman is given plenty of room to go nuts and any fan of his previous work will realize that were a long way from ""Rushmore."" He appears less directed by Nicks than casually blocked with minimal guidance and the result is a performance that will glue some to their seats in stunned amazement and drive others up the aisle. Maronnas own nonsensical shtick has thankfully brief screen time while Segel (""Freaks and Geeks"") projects a sober strength that hints he should graduate from dumb youth pics into more grown-up material. King has good chemistry with Sawa but Laura Prepon as her ubersexy roomie is a life force unto herself deserving her own movie. Somewhat slummy production look and nutty soundtrack are in keeping with the overall attitude.

His prize for not squealing? The guys must bag him Angela (King) brightest most beautiful girl on campus. But in his pursuit of duty Dave (Sawa) falls for Angela himself. The movies given the nod here include Mrs Doubtfire Theres Something About Mary The Graduate and William Shakespeares Romeo amp; Juliet. Its undoubtedly a lads film (the implausible romantic stuff feels like an afterthought) though the laughs are almost entirely at their expense. If its unlikely to stimulate the brain cells it will almost certainly make you laugh out loud.

But its unique in one way director Dewey Nicks narrative incompetence. The footage seems to have been tossed into the air and randomly reassembled when it hit the ground. And although the script contains moments of intentional surrealism the most peculiar thing about ""Slackers"" is that it was released for public consumption. Dave (Devon Sawa) Sam (Jason Segel) and Jeff (Michael C. Maronna) are best buddies whove done everything in their power to avoid getting a college education while attending a major university. The first 15 minutes of the picture are devoted to Dave explaining the ""clever"" way that he and his friends cheat on a final exam. This sequence could have been handled in a 90-second montage but you get the feeling that Nicks has to drag things out just to come up with enough footage to construct the semblance of a motion picture. You cant after all distribute a 20-minute movie. Creepy characters During the tainted exam Dave notices a beautiful young coed named Angela (former model James King). He writes his phone number on his test paper and whispers to Angela that she should call him some time which draws the ire of ""Cool Ethan"" (Jason Schwartzman) a psychotic undergrad who badly wants Angela for himself.

USATODAY.com - Slackers is cockamamie chicanery Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 01/31/2002 - Updated 0433 PM ET Slackers is cockamamie chicanery By Mike Clark USA TODAY Slackers (out of four) Stars Devon Sawa Jason Schwartzman James King Michael C. Maronna Jason Segel Director Dewey Nicks Distributor Screen Gems Rating R for strong language sexual content and brief drug use Dont confuse director Dewey Nicks Slackers with Richard Linklaters esteemed 1991 Slacker or other more classy entertainment. That said no movie with an extended Mamie Van Doren topless scene (shell be 71 Wednesday) is lacking in nerve to plumb fresh sources for comic shock value. There are laughs here but easily as many groans. The setting is fictional Holden University and theres a nut on the loose Rushmores Jason Schwartzman who in his most extreme moments seems to have studied under Norman Bates. Intense goal-oriented and a thorough creep Schwartzmans Ethan character is obviously no slacker but has it in for three chronic cheaters (Devon Sawa Jason Segel Michael C. Maronna) who are. Blackmailer Ethan discovers the buddies elaborate exam scams and would turn them in -- if he werent so taken with an angelic coed named Angela (James King a name that belies an all-girl cutie). Sawas Dave must use his well-honed skills in chicanery to play Cupid for the two otherwise Ethan wont zip a lip Dave longs to split. Unfortunately Angela has a thing for Dave and finds Ethan a little unsettling -- even before she discovers he has been sniffing a doll figure hes constructed from her hair strands collected around campus. Somehow a first-time director has pulled some casting strings starting with that revealing look at Van Doren in a hospital where Angela and Ethan volunteer. Cameron Diaz and Gina Gershon show up in sexual-fantasy cameos while 70s babe Leigh Taylor Young (as Angelas mother) performs off-screen oral sex on Sawa a few minutes after the two meet. Nicks and writer David H. Steinberg (a story credit on American Pie 2) have fun spoofing smarmy grad assistants and creative masturbation techniques but the classroom-goof-off genre has gotten pretty slack. It wouldnt be surprising to see Schwartzman -- also nerdy in Rushmore -- typed for life once casting directors see him wearing womens panties on his head or secretly camcording the love of his life having sex with someone else. Not even a gladiator movie or a hit CD of show tunes would be enough to snap this cycle.

Cui Lin as Guei (left) and Lee bin as Jian in ""Beijing Bicycle."" Photo HANDOUT FILM CLIPS / Also opening today 1 / 1 Back to Gallery SLACKERS Comedy. Starring Devon Sawa Jason Schwartzman and James King. Directed by Dewey Nicks. (R. 87 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . An angry delusional man becomes obsessed with a beautiful woman. He follows her everywhere and compiles a video library of her going about her daily business. He contrives to work where she works. He decorates his room with her photos and even creates a doll from her stray hairs. He loves and hates her and he has fantasies in which shes ""screaming and screaming and screaming."" Funny no? No. Not funny. The above description sounds like the basis for an unpleasant thriller. It sounds like a prelude to violence. Instead its the central plot line of ""Slackers"" a discordant comedy that gives bad taste a bad name. Jason Schwartzman plays Ethan a college nerd whos neurotically obsessed with Angela (James King). One day he uncovers a test-cheating scheme and goes to the three perpetrators -- a trio of slackers hence the misleading title. He threatens to have them expelled unless they help him get Angela. But Ethan is an entirely repellent character. Not much of a chance there. With the exception of Angela every woman goes through ""Slackers"" in a frenzy of sexual heat making for some absurd and even grotesque scenes. Mamie Van Doren plays a hospital patient who insists on a sponge bath from a hospital orderly. This leads to a protracted topless scene in which the 70- year-old former bombshell oohs and ahs in a state of arousal. The scene isnt particularly amusing but it does remind us why clothes were invented. Devon Sawa plays the romantic lead a slacker who falls in love with Angela in the process of wooing her on Ethans behalf. Sawa is an engaging enough screen presence even if he does give the impression of having practiced his smirk in the mirror. . This film contains strong language and nudity. -- Mick LaSalle BEIJING BICYCLE Drama. Starring Cui Lin Li Bin and Zhou Xun. Directed by Wang Xiaoshuai. (PG-13. 103 minutes. At the Lumiere and Shattuck in Berkeley.) . For generations of Beijing residents the bicycle was a prized possession the primary mode of transportation and a symbol of upward mobility. It still is for some of the citys striving poor whose world is depicted in director Wang Xiaoshuais new film ""Beijing Bicycle."" This is a moderately engaging tale of two young men who fight over the same silver mountain bike that embodies their desires dreams and frustrations. Guei (Cui Lin) is a country bumpkin new to the big city where he lands a job as a bike messenger. Hes given a haircut a uniform and a shiny new bicycle that will belong to him after about a months work. Whizzing along Beijings bustling streets Guei is exhilarated and daunted by this new world of glass towers marble lobbies brusque businessmen and teeming boulevards. And hes awed by a pretty girl in a red dress and heels who seems beyond his reach. But just before Guei pays off the bike its stolen robbing him of his livelihood. He frantically searches the city runs into trouble with the cops and eventually finds his beloved bike. It now belongs to Jian (Li Bin) a poor rebellious city boy who bought it at a flea market. The new wheels give Jian a sense of freedom and status; they allow him to hang out with his richer school chums and feel cool with his new girlfriend. One of the films most memorable images is of Jian pedaling joyously along a tree-lined river loosening his shirt and tie and spreading his arms in a gesture of release. Jian and Guei struggle over the bike in a series of scenes whose chases and confrontations become repetitious. People keep telling Guei how stubborn he is. Jian gets sullen when he loses the bike. We feel their desperation but the characterizations lack shading and complexity. Whats interesting is Wangs portrayal of class differences and social attitudes -- the way city and country folk see each other -- and his depiction of a city in flux. He contrasts images of Beijings skyscrapers with its ancient alleys and courtyards where old men sit in the sun children play families live in close quarters. We see the endless flow of city life -- waves of bicyclists and cars and pedestrians -- in slowed-down images that move in a kind of dreamy urban ballet. . This film contains some violence. -- Jesse Hamlin WHAT TIME IS IT THERE? Domestic drama. In Mandarin Cantonese and French with English subtitles. Directed by Tsai Ming-Liang. (R. 116 minutes. At the Lumiere the Rafael and Camera in San Jose.) Grief hangs heavy in ""What Time Is It There?"" a leaden new drama by Taiwanese director Tsai Ming-Liang (""The River""). Composed in anesthetizing sustained long shots the film follows Hsiao Kang (the tenderly handsome Lee Kang-Sheng) a young man who sells watches on the streets of Taipei and his mother (Lu Yi-Ching) after the death of the family patriarch. When Hsiao Kang meets an insistent customer (the alluring porcelain- skinned Chen Shiang-Chyi whose character shares her name) theres a brief shiver of possibility. But with Shiang-Chyis move to Paris the next day and subsequent descent into her own cone of isolation the mood remains drearily gray. Things happen in a flat deadpan way. The watch seller becomes fixated on the time difference between Taipei and Paris. The remote object of his desire encounters French actor Jean-Pierre Leaud in a Paris cemetery one of several strained allusions to Francois Truffauts ""The 400 Blows."" This is the sort of thing that gives film homage a bad name. ""What Time Is It There?"" suggests that loneliness can reverberate among people even when theyre separated. Sex becomes a yearning common language for the characters when the watch seller engages a prostitute his Parisian counterpart spends the night with a woman and the mother pursues a solitary pleasure. Tsai reserves a few mildly comic and lyrical gestures to contrive an ending. But the weight of the films opaque numbingly studied details -- Hsiao Kang eating noodles or demonstrating a watchs durability his mother staring at a clock Shiang-Chyi in the Paris subways -- is oppressive. No wonder a huge white fish in an aquarium looks so welcome. At least the things moving and staying aloft. . This film contains sexual situations. -- Steven Winn AMERICAN ADOBO Soap opera. Directed by Laurice Guillen. Written by Vincent R. Nebrida. (Rated R. 104 minutes. At the Opera Plaza.) . Adobo is the national dish of the Philippines. Its made with pork or chicken vinegar garlic olive oil and peppercorns. What it doesnt have are the chunks of ham and cheese that went into ""American Adobo"" a well-meaning but mediocre film about Filipino Americans. Obviously modeled after ""The Joy Luck Club"" and ""Eat Drink Man Woman"" ""Adobo"" offers a soap-opera gloss on the mixed-up lives of five college buddies living in New York. We meet the arrogant queen bee Marissa (Dina Bonnevie) the tragically single Tere (Cherry Pie Picache) unhappily married Mike (Christopher De Leon) womanizing Raul (Paolo Montalban) and closeted gay Gerry (Ricky Davao). Over dinner parties and backyard barbecues in cars and on cell phones the friends reveal secrets float advice and bemoan their fates. Character development is thin and cliches abundant -- especially in the case of Gerry receptacle of not one but a cluster of stereotypes a crush on his straight best friend a lover with AIDS (""Chris"" is his name lending itself easily to vague gender-nonspecific references) and a mother who knows more than he thinks she does. Director Laurice Guillen and writer Vincent R. Nebrida create random moments of familial charm and bonhomie among the nest of pals -- typically when they meet for dinner and their voices rise in a mixture of Tagalog and English. More often the movie is stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed. The actors most of whom are active in Philippine movies and TV are adequate. Randy Becker (""Love Valour Compassion"" onstage and on film) stands out as Marissas two-timing lover. . This film contains nudity and raw language. -- Edward Guthmann Most Popular 1 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 2 Cops Son of billionaire former supermodel arrested after... 3 Ann Coulter Hammered by Conservatives for Smearing US War... 4 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 5 Dear Abby I dont want anyone to know that Ive retired 6 Bikini-clad Swedish cop makes arrest while sunbathing 7 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed 8 Police Girl 14 slits teens throat in hope of first kill 9 Inmate charged in 2015 quadruple slaying in S.F. 10 7-year-old girl dies after elephant at zoo throws a rock at her Find Showtimes Search Theaters amp; Showtimes -- County -- Alameda Contra Costa Lake Marin Napa San Francisco San Mateo Santa Clara Solano Sonoma Show Movies Now Playing | Recent Releases | Critics Favorites Rated G | PG | PG-13 | R Latest News Little shake 2.7-magnitude earthquake rattles Bay Area Hot air balloon carrying at least 16 people crashes in Texas Philippine president calls off truce after rebel attack Ann Coulter slammed for calling war heros dad angry Muslim 4 Sierra plane crash victims were from Tuolumne County Inmate charged in 2015 quadruple slaying in S.F.
