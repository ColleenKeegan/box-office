Such a schema may in the right hands make for a powerful all-seeing movie; here it all becomes a blur. A moving target if there ever was one ""Angel Eyes"" darts back and forth from being a psychological thriller to a vaguely metaphysical drama to a fate-driven romance. Such a schema may in the right hands make for a powerful all-seeing movie; here it all becomes a blur. From the title to the ethereal ads prominently displaying Jennifer Lopez as the marquee-topping star she has become viewers are misled to expect a romancer involving otherworldly forces. In fact pic is rooted in the realities of Chicago street life and shattered lives haplessly mixing in half-baked notions of fate and destiny. Playing much too softly for high-impact early summer numbers even as it faces off against the giant ogre named ""Shrek"" pic is guaranteed J.Los loyal B.O. posse but will test whether the female aud that supported her ""Wedding Planner"" might show up again. Scribe Gerald DiPego and helmer Luis Mandoki are incurable romantics following their ultra-weepie ""Message in a Bottle"" with this new variation on lonely hearts. While ""Message"" stayed obsessively true to its romantic code ""Angel Eyes"" appears to want to have it as many ways as possible. While mixing and matching genres is always welcome this project stands as a firm reminder that such blending is fraught with risks. A sense of forced dramatics hangs over the prologue as ace Polish lenser Piotr Sobocinskis Steadicam roams about a disastrous multicar collision like a seasick drunk -- as if the cameras sheer wobbliness will get us in the mood for feeling akimbo. Tough Chi cop Sharon Pogue (Lopez) prods a breathing crash victim to ""stay with me"" but a transition to a year later leaves the traffic tragedy in limbo. Catch (Jim Caviezel) wanders the streets doing unmotivated good deeds such as bringing weekly groceries to kindly Elanora (Shirley Knight) but also appears to be in constant internal pain. Sharon -- as Mandoki films it -- straps on her bulletproof vest like a fashion item goes out and beats up bad guys. When Catch eyes Sharon in a cafe he flashes back on an accident. So early in the story does ""Angel Eyes"" give away the key link between Catch and Sharon that watching it amounts to a long wait for the characters to get up to speed. Still the combo of Caviezels spooky wordless approach and Marco Beltramis ethereal if unimaginative scoring hints at a more supernatural explanation for Catchs existence -- especially when out of the blue (and with apparently superhuman quickness) Catch is able to save Sharons life during a breathless chase of a thug. In Sharons background is a family torn apart Her father (Victor Argo) hasnt spoken to her since she had him arrested for beating her mother (Sonia Braga) while -- in one of pics most effective scenes -- brother Larry (Jeremy Sisto) seems to have picked up his fathers worst brutal habits. Sharon is thus not too eager to attend her folks upcoming renewing of their wedding vows. DiPegos dialogue is at its best when conveying this information indirectly the way people actually talk and Lopez reaches her strongest emotive moments when expressing Sharons resentment for having become the black sheep for doing what she feels was the right thing. After initial awkwardness Sharon and Catch get along so great that they go for summery sexy frolics by the lakeside. Even as Catch remains stubbornly mum about himself Sharon confesses to him about feeling guilty that she never stood up to her dad during his wife-beating sessions. During a date with Sharon Catch jumps onto the stage of the Jazz Spot to play a haunting trumpet take on the standard ""Nature Boy"" (also a dominant number it so happens in Cannes opener ""Moulin Rouge""). An encounter outside the club leads to Sharon fitting the final pieces of the Catch puzzle together. This belated move as predictable as it is mechanical only brings all of the movies problems to the surface and even a final confrontation between Sharon and her father doesnt add psychological focus to a drama split in several directions. If the finish of ""Message in a Bottle"" was the Hallmark-card image for sad moods this one is the version designed to put a smile on your face. Lopez has shown that she rises or falls to the occasion depending on the quality of the script. Apropos this material shes in middling mode neither terrifically affecting nor so bland that you fail to notice her every move. She tends to work harder in her many scenes opposite Caviezel who is the pics still quiet presence from start to finish. Playing a variation of his perf in ""The Thin Red Line"" Caviezels penetrating eyes appear to be either seeing God or Death or both If ever there were the actor to play the main role in the movie about the Second Coming here he is. Knight brings a brief gentle effect on the drama while Sistos dark-edged character deserves more screen time than he receives. All tech departments are at the top of their game including one of the more convincing attempts (among many in recent movie history) to turn Toronto into the Windy City.

It is Chicago policewoman Sharon Pogue (Jennifer Lopez) who talks the guy through gives him back his life. Roll opening credits let some time pass and we discover a man known only as ""Catch"" (Jim Caviezel) roaming the citys mean streets doing good deeds one of which consists of saving Sharons life during a shoot-out. You know of course that he is the grieving accident victim atoning for the beloved lives he thinks he has carelessly wasted. You can guess cant you that fate means they will fall in love--especially since Sharons relationship with her family (father mother wife-beating brother) is as fractious as her would-be lovers was idyllic. What you probably will never guess is that Angel Eyes is better than the plot makes it sound. Partly thats because the director Luis Mandoki who made the ghastly Message in a Bottle balances the movies sentiment with a good tough view of a cops life both on the job and (especially) off duty. Hes good with the hard kidding in bars and junk-food emporiums. Mostly though the movie works because Lopez gives such a terrific performance. Shes a vulnerable hard-ass lonesome but damned if shell admit it forgiving in some relationships unforgiving in others. Its an intense complex performance in unexpected circumstances. If its occasionally undercut by a script that sometimes speaks when it should shut up and by excessive recessiveness on Caviezels part it is still very much worth checking out.

(Warner Bros.) When shes not slamming thugs the size of sumo wrestlers upside the hood of her squad car Jennifer Lopezs butt-busting heroine in ""Angel Eyes"" is boo-hoo-hooing in the privacy of her lonely room. J-Lo is Jell-O on the inside. Sniff. Director Luis Mandoki whose previous credits include the hankie-sopping ""Message in a Bottle"" cant seem to decide what kind of movie he wants to make A ghost story? (There are shades of ""The Sixth Sense"" here.) Perhaps a gritty urban buddy-cop drama? A tale of family dysfunction? A romance uniting two lost souls? The answer is E all of the above. The consequence The audience hasnt the slightest idea what is going on. That can be good if the filmmaker has some idea in mind like a kid who sees dead people. But Mandoki doesnt have anything new to contribute to this puree of genres. The movie opens with twisted metal sirens blaring red lights reflected in the rain-glossed street a beautiful Chicago cop seen through the eyes of the grievously injured driver. Sharon Pogue a comely Chicago police officer with melting chocolate eyes holds the unseen mans hand while urging ""Stay with me. Stay with me."" About a year later we catch up with Sharon and her partner (Terrence Howard) in the middle of a chase. When Sharon is attacked from behind a mysterious stranger Catch (Jim Caviezel) comes to her rescue. As he gently pulls her to her feet she stares into his ethereal blue eyes. Theres obviously a connection between them. Who is this gorgeously disheveled savior? Duh Although Sharon has been shunned by her family for having her abusive father arrested she overcomes her fear of intimacy and begins to fall in love. Inevitably she is forced to face her father when he and her mother (Sonia Braga) renew their wedding vows. Sharon reluctantly attends and attempts to make amends with her father concluding with an appalling apology to the horrid old man. Luckily the two leads do share some sizzle. If only the filmmakers could decide between the frying pan and the fire.""Angel Eyes"" (103 minutes) is rated R for language violence and a scene of sexuality.

"USATODAY.com - No sparkle in Lopezs Angel Eyes Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 05/17/2001 - Updated 0415 PM ET No sparkle in Lopezs Angel Eyes By Susan Wloszczyna USA TODAY Angel Eyes (out of four) Stars Jennifer Lopez Jim Caviezel Sonia Braga Director Luis Mandoki Distributor Warner Bros. Rating R for language violence and a scene of sexuality Angel Eyes is a wisp of ghost story that promises insight but is strictly soft focus. Instead of supernatural forces however the destined-to-meet lovers in this not-so-heavenly hash of a romance are haunted by the past. Jennifer Lopezs tough-cookie cop cant get close to anyone because of a legacy of family abuse. Jim Caviezels loner wanders the city streets his Windex-blue eyes reflecting his anguish and performs good deeds to block out tragic memories. Read more Video Angel Eyes trailer Photo Gallery Jennifer Lopez Audio Love Dont Cost A Thing One of these deeds is saving Lopezs life when a gunman tries to kill her. Talk about meeting cute. They each have their share of off-putting habits. She has ""sleep"" issues -- shes an insomniac. He has ""door"" issues -- he leaves them open. They both at least like coffee. The two wounded souls start a tentative relationship then break it off when a secret is uncovered then come together again after tear-stained speeches. Simple right? Except this drama by director Luis Mandoki and writer Gerald DiPego who both did the similarly adrift Message in a Bottle prefers to circle the action rather than move on. Take the opening car crash. Lopez shows her hard-boiled characters tender side as she reaches out and implores an unseen victim to ""stay with me."" The story skips ahead to a year later never showing the outcome of the accident. But the grim scene continues to hover ominously over the movie like a bad mood making it too easy to guess who was inside the wreck. At least Caviezel and Lopez with their incredible faces emote well together. Hiding behind just-so stubble and a long floppy coat he especially keeps us guessing. Is he crazy or slow-witted? Neither as his bluntly honest answers to questions prove to be amusing. When she suggests he should be a cop Caviezel answers ""Oh I dont know. I dont look very good in hats."" But this mystery man refuses to explain his near-empty apartment and lack of a job. Lopez on the other hand is a mixed bag. Her glam status is starting to hurt her credibility in everyday roles. Here she dons a bulletproof vest as if it were a trendy accessory. When she nervously tries on outfit after outfit before an event you want to laugh. This pedigreed clotheshorse never has trouble making a fashion statement. Shes more effective when confronting her brother (Jeremy Sisto) after he repeats the sins of their father and slugs his wife. Lopez tightens into a ball of anger and lashes out passionately and you finally believe her torment. Her discomfort is palpable when her mother (Sonia Braga -- when did this Brazilian bombshell grow so haggard?) announces that she and Lopezs estranged dad are renewing their vows. But Angel Eyes can be downright silly like when a moony Lopez pieces together the dandelion puffball that Caviezel gave her days ago. Just like the movie it irretrievably falls apart.

Starring Jennifer Lopez and Jim Caviezel. Directed by Luis Mandoki. (R. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. With ""Angel Eyes"" audiences will see a new relaxation in Jennifer Lopez. She takes her time. She really listens. She reacts. She doesnt try to control scenes or control her face. She lets moments happen. Credit director Luis Mandoki or maturity or confidence or an actress finding the right role. Whatever the reasons Lopez who was always competent onscreen is now an actress who can do things other movie stars cant do. She doesnt push just thinks and her thoughts and emotions burn into the film. As for the movie itself its sneaky in the best way though some viewers will be annoyed. Its not a thriller even though the title sounds like something about a serial killer. Its not a crime picture even though Lopez plays a Chicago policewoman. ""Angel Eyes"" is a romantic drama. In fact its next door to an art film. Audiences may be thrown by it. Romantic movies are usually comedies. If not theyre thrillers in which lovers meet fall in love and kill a homicidal maniac. In ""Angel Eyes"" its just two people one weird one Lopez who find each other. The weird one is Catch played by Jim Caviezel. Catch is tall and thin and floats around Chicago -- or what is supposed to pass for Chicago -- needing a shave and looking at the world through the blue eyes of a Technicolor Jesus. He lives in an apartment thats virtually empty and behaves as though his head is in some other world. Caviezel seeming like a cross between Henry Fonda and Norman Bates maintains an aura of mystery without seeming too coy or austere. Lopez who looks comfortable in a police officers uniform plays Sharon a woman whos fearless but has a lot of pain underneath the surface. Poor Sharon has one of those families that people have a way of having -- a father who used to beat up Mom a brother who now beats his wife. But heres the realistic touch Theyre all mad at her. True to the adage that no good deed goes unpunished they are outraged -- even worse deeply hurt and confused by her cruelty -- because years before Sharon called the cops on Dad when he was pummeling Mom. ""Angel Eyes"" is the rare film that presents a family dynamic as demented as ones we know from life. Movies usually would have us believe that if people would only talk etc. Here the family members are too twisted and too invested in their self-delusion for conversation to matter. Sharon knows its not her fault that shes the only human in a family of cretins but she feels as if it is and its lonely. So she could use a love life. Early in the movie she meets Catch under extreme circumstances which may or may not have been divinely ordained. She likes him even though he doesnt have a job and refuses to talk about his life. ""You ever hear of starting from scratch?"" he says. ""This is scratch."" The rest of the movie is about the ups and downs of this peculiar courtship with next to no action to spice things up. Some viewers will be pulling out their hair. Discerning viewers will get into the rhythm. ""Angel Eyes"" is a rare thing -- a well-acted character study of a hardworking woman by a screenwriter (Gerald DiPego) and a director with enough integrity to dispense with the usual Hollywood distractions. Advisory This film contains violence and sexual situations.

"CNN.com - Review Angel Eyes looks like a winner - May 18 2001 MAIN PAGE WORLD U.S. WEATHER BUSINESS SPORTS POLITICS LAW SCI-TECH SPACE HEALTH ENTERTAINMENT TRAVEL EDUCATION IN-DEPTH QUICK NEWS LOCAL COMMUNITY MULTIMEDIA E-MAIL SERVICES CNNtoGO ABOUT US CNN TV whats on show transcripts CNN Headline News CNN International askCNN EDITIONS CNN.com Asia CNN.com Europe set your edition Languages --------- Time Inc. --------- Time.com People Fortune EW The divine Miss J.Lo triumphs Review Angel Eyes looks like a winner By Paul ClintonCNN Reviewer (CNN) -- Whenever Jennifer Lopez puts on a uniform and carries a gun theres something that just works. In ""Out of Sight"" (1998) she sizzled opposite George Clooney and was completely believable in her role as a federal marshal. In her latest movie ""Angel Eyes"" shes once again in the groove this time as a Chicago street cop. Putting aside her last two choices ""The Cell"" and ""The Wedding Planner"" it seems J.Lo can deliver when given the right material and the right director. Its worth mentioning that with ""Out of Sight"" she was in the hands of Academy Award-winner Steven Soderbergh (""Traffic"" and ""Erin Brockovich"" of last year). With ""Angel Eyes"" shes been guided by Luis Mandoki (1990s ""White Palace"" 1999s ""Message In A Bottle"") a filmmaker known as an ""actors director"" who works well with intense emotional material.

(Warner Bros.) Give ""Angel Eyes"" credit for trying to be a better movie. A romantic mystery thats built entirely around Jennifer Lopezs appeal - dramatic and otherwise - this movie does its journeyman best with a handful of familiar chestnuts the mysterious man (played by Jim Caviezel) who may or may not be an earthly angel; the dysfunctional family who are all living under the emotional yoke of Big Bad Dad; and the police officer (Lopez) who has a hard time taking off that badge and being emotionally open and vulnerable. Lopez is Chicago cop Sharon Pogue whos chasing a gunman when shes ambushed. The bad guy is just about to blast out her brains when a stranger (Caviezel) saves the day. Shes shocked but of course greatly relieved. Naturally shes curious. So she gets to know this guy who calls himself Catch. Hes a hard one to know. He doesnt have much to say about himself. But hes got this celestial glow in the eyes. Theres something about him. And he seems very interested in her. The subplot comes up soon enough. Sharons parents (Victor Argo and Sonia Braga) whove been through some tough times want to renew their vows. Sharon who - as a cop - confronted her fathers abusive ways is less than enthused by her invitation to the ceremony. Estranged from her father shes not sure what to do. We have two things hanging in the balance Who is Catch? Will Sharon make up with Dad? Unfortunately the movie (directed by Luis Mandoki) doesnt give itself much more. Which means the movie has to take its time solving them (or run out of material before the end). And that makes the going a little slow and rather frustrating especially when we learn the truth about Catch. At first the movie makes him a compelling enigma. By the end it makes him a Hollywood banality. His background story isnt staggeringly original. But theres a nice atmosphere to the movie thanks to Lopezs earthy straightforward performance; the visual import of Caviezel whos great to look at (at least for a while); and the movies rejection of a crowd-pleasing shoot-em-up climax. ""Angel Eyes"" is about a cops need to clean out the psychic cobwebs from her life and help Catch clean out his. This is all about getting your life back on course before you can fall in love. Which isnt such a bad idea for a movie as long as theres something more. Unfortunately there isnt. ""Angel Eyes"" (R 104 minutes) - Contains sexual scenes obscenity car crash violence and a few shoot-em-up scenes.

C- Angel Eyes Genre Mystery and Thriller Drama; Starring James Caviezel Jennifer Lopez Sonia Braga Terrence Howard; Director Luis Mandoki; Author Gerald DiPego Michael Seitzman; Release Date Wide 05/18/2001; Runtime (in minutes) 104; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted May 16 2001 -- 1200 AM EDT Jennifer Lopez did a dance with the devil in the gruesomely imagistic ""The Cell"" so I guess it qualifies as a stretch that in Angel Eyes where she is once again cast as a tough babe cop she flirts with the opposite end of the metaphysical spectrum. In Chicago Lopezs Officer Sharon Pogue is rescued from an ambush by a mysterious stranger who continues to follow her around. Tall dark and unshaven the winsome stalker who calls himself Catch (Jim Caviezel) appears to mean well but hes also monosyllabic and a bit creepy like a rumpled nice guy version of Norman Bates. Were meant to wonder whether he has been sent from you know up there. It gives away nothing to say that the movie a cumbersome dud grows draggier with each new revelation. Lopez is a quick-minded and intuitive actress but as she has honed her body and personality into that of an officially empowered pop superstar she has never come close to displaying the fluky inner fire that she had in ""Out of Sight."" Amid the sticky genre murk of ""Angel Eyes"" she and Caviezel get to deliver one teary cathartic speech apiece and we realize that regardless of who is or is not an angel theyre both playing saints. The two redeem each other but Jennifer Lopez needs to be redeemed from trash like this.
