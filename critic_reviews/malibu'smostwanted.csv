Even weirder is a talking mouse with the voice of Snoop Dogg who disses fellow movie mouse Stuart Little in an intimate bedroom conversation with the movies lead (Jamie Kennedy). Kelli Lefkowitz left Jamie Kennedy and Nick Swardson are a bizarre bunch in Malibus Most Wanted. Its just a guess but by now you probably know if this movie is for you. Anything goes in this tolerable toss-off in which Scream series veteran Kennedy plays ONeals son a white rapper wannabe the kind of kid who would call even Donald Rumsfeld ""homey."" Think of a B-grade Bulworth with lesser talents than A-listers Warren Beatty and Halle Berry. Review of the movie Malibus Most Wanted ( out of four) Stars Jamie Kennedy Taye Diggs Anthony Anderson Blair Underwood Regina Hall Director John Whitesell Distributor Warner Bros. Rating PG-13 for sexual humor language and violence Opens Friday nationwide Thats not to put down the actors. Taye Diggs and Anthony Anderson seem to be enjoying themselves as trained thespians who pose as gangstas to make a mock kidnap attempt on Kennedys character. Dads staffers see the Malibu-bred ""B-Rad"" as a liability to his political campaign and hope the abduction will scare him back into whiteness. Regina Hall is also in the spirit as Diggs comely cousin and theres the added fun of seeing Bo Derek as ONeals wife with a chronically dazed look of ""What am I doing here?"" Kennedys performance eventually runs out of gas but the character cant help but resonate with those who like me stumble over a white rapper pretender by walking into the kitchen. At 86 minutes the movie knows when to quit and theres an occasional funny line. ""I didnt know Dairy Queen had a rap label"" one put-down artist says to Kennedy during a contest out of 8 Mile. With on-screen dogs like Bringing Down the House and Head of State still in theaters this is a long long way from Moviedoms Most Negligible.

Starring Jamie Kennedy Taye Diggs Anthony Anderson and Regina Hall. Directed by John Whitesell. Written by Fax Bahr Adam Small Jamie Kennedy and Nick Swardson. (PG-13 80 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Malibus Most Wanted"" is a small triumph for lowered expectations. If youve seen the trailer featuring Jamie Kennedys dopey white rapper wannabe you are probably expecting a lamebrain one-joke waste of cash. Actually it is better than that. Just barely. Kennedy is B-Rad one of those kids you see in suburbia who have immersed themselves into hip-hop culture and style even though the biggest crisis in his ""hood"" comes when the latte machine goes on the blink. Living a life much different from your own is an old and familiar tradition. Only the clothes and sounds change. There were the college-student guitar players who faithfully growled Mississippi Delta blues the urban cowboys who bought hats and big belt buckles to ride mechanical bulls and the Beat generation hangers on who wore goatees and black turtlenecks and wrote moody poetry. Hanging around the mall with his powder-blue visor skewed stylishly over his right ear B-Rad thinks of himself as an Eminem. But we can see hes more like an Mamp;M -- mass-produced sugary and insignificant. The kicker is that not only is B-Rad rich but his father (Ryan ONeal) is also running for governor. B-Rad is a nice enough kid but his misguided attempts to ""keep it real"" damage Dads chances in the election. A plan is hatched to take B-Rad who has ""never been east of Beverly Hills "" to the real streets of the hood. The idea is to scare B-Rad back into being Bradley the suburban white-bread nerd. Complications ensue. B-Rad is a sketch character that Kennedy worked up for his WB TV show ""The Jamie Kennedy Experiment."" His gangsta slang and weird inflections are funny for a while but the character doesnt go anywhere remaining essentially clueless throughout the movie. In fact it is a little hard to understand how we are supposed to view B- Rad. At some points he seems to think he is actually African American asking the maid ""When will they leave our people alone?"" But at others hes an oblivious privileged kid. Discussing the indignities of life with another character B-Rad asks ""Like when the public be all up on your private beach?"" The saving grace is the supporting cast and a few witty plot twists. This is the kind of movie where if characters show up carrying a blunderbuss a spear gun and a rocket-propelled grenade launcher -- and they do -- you can bet that each will be fired to good effect. Best of the supporting cast are Taye Diggs (""How Stella Got Her Groove Back"") and Anthony Anderson (""Kangaroo Jack"") who play two aspiring actors hired to pretend to be thugs from the hood to scare B-Rad back into being Bradley. Diggs character Sean who misses no chance to remind everyone that he studied at Juilliard works nicely with PJ Andersons character who is a little defensive that his training is from the Pasadena Playhouse. The two decide to treat the assignment as a role and earn laughs when they jump back and forth between their inner-city characters -- Bloodbath and Tre -- and dead-on impressions of self-absorbed actors attempting to ""find"" a character. Kudos to the filmmakers for not going for the cliche laughs and making these two overtly gay. Because you know they considered it. Somewhere amid the slapstick you can spot promising comic minds at work. The characters unexpectedly step up to make clever observations like when Shondra (Regina Hall) sees B-Rad taking the stage at a rough inner-city rap club. ""This"" she says ""is gonna be like an episode from Oz. "" As a star vehicle for Kennedy ""Malibu"" doesnt advance the ball but the timing could be perfect to grab the eager-for-the-end-of-school crowd. If so expect ""Dont be hatin "" to be the catchphrase of the summer. The T-shirts were already printed up at the screening. . Advisory profanity gunfire and sexual situations.

Posted May 2 2003 -- 1200 AM EDT No one can accuse Jamie Kennedy of not having the white rap thing down. As B-Rad a Southern California rich kid who fancies himself a stone-cold gangsta hes a privileged dork in a puke-green track suit thrusting his fingers at perplexed boutique cashiers. Kennedys Eminem shtick is set up as parody but its too much of a straight imitation a walking audition for American Rap Idol. He wears out his welcome in five minutes.

Pic is about a PCH-based white boy so deep into rap he cant stop behaving like one of the homies. What could have been a wily satire on contempo racial politics and culture ""Malibus Most Wanted"" ultimately implodes letting down the hood hip-hoppers and Jamie Kennedy fans looking forward to his first major starring role. Based on the character of Brad ""B-Rad"" Gluckman developed for his tube comedy series ""JKX The Jamie Kennedy Experiment"" pic is about a PCH-based white boy so deep into rap he cant stop behaving like one of the homies. Although its never more than silly there are enough caustic observations and keenly timed scenes in the early going to raise hopes this will go beyond the muddled multi-racial bags of both ""Bringing Down the House"" and ""Head of State."" Comic failings and lack of major hip-hop stars will mute overall B.O.; the question remains however whether Kennedys lampoon will be embraced or scorned by African-American auds. During its first hour pic generally holds together introducing B-Rad as a self-imagined ""player"" cruising with his well-financed but ludicrous ""crew"" while rapping about the ""street life"" of Malibu as well as his clash with his father and California gubernatorial candidate (Ryan ONeal) whose campaign cant handle his rapping child and the subsequent plot to ""scare the black"" out of B-Rad by staging a mock-kidnapping in the ghetto. On this thin string of a situation Kennedy and his collaborators including helmer John Whitesell hang all sorts of pointed topics from the goofy way hip-hop is translated by white suburbanites and the parallels between bare-knuckled political campaigning and gang-banging to the pattern of whites wanting to be black -- like B-Rad -- and blacks wanting to be white -- like his hired kidnappers classically trained thesps Sean (Taye Diggs) and PJ (Anthony Anderson). The two actors-turned-kidnappers rehearse their roles as tough street hoods with all the diligence of Actors Studio students. Trying to tie all of this up into a neat package complete with de rigeur homilies about how B-Rad needs to be true to himself proves the films undoing. Befriended by Seans cousin Shondra (Regina Hall) who had been hired at first to help in the kidnapping B-Rad gets involved with genuine gangsta Tec (Damien Dante Wayans). He even leads the charge during a gun battle with Tecs foes. But because B-Rad is more of a satirical symbol than a full-fledged character his fuzzy turns and transformations eventually make little sense and deliver even fewer laughs. Kennedys shtick also begins to wear at the hour point by which time B-Rad has pretty much used up all of his unselfconscious charm. In fact though the exhibition business wont allow for the kind of hourlong comedies that were a staple during the silent era ""Malibus Most Wanted"" would have fit better under that constriction. Anderson and Diggs use their stored-up knowledge of thesps to make delicious mincemeat of them here while Hall Underwood Wayans and ONeal take their roles seriously enough to keep their satiric contributions on track. Snoop Dogg whose personal lingo clearly inspired much of B-Rads own does the funny voice of a rat that has advice for our young hero. Tech work is better than most recent low-to-mid-budget studio comedies. Malibus Most WantedProductionA Warner Bros. release of a Karz Entertainment production.
