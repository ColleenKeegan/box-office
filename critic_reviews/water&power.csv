"Review Richard Montoyas Water amp; Power falters from stage to film - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Richard Montoyas Water amp; Power falters from stage to film A behind-the-scenes look at filming around the world for television and movies as seen from the streets. Gary Goldstein Past present and future are all brought to bear in Water amp; Power No matter how much writer-director Richard Montoya tries to open up the screen adaptation of his stage play ""Water amp; Power"" which premiered at L.A.s Mark Taper Forum in 2006 its hard to forget that youre watching a piece with theatrical roots.Thats because it seems as if Montoya hasnt recalibrated his works florid crafty dialogue or its arch rhythms of speech and performance to fit the inherent pacing and more up-close-and-personal nature of film. (To wit the actors strong as they are too often feel like theyre ""acting."") The result is an uncomfortable hybrid that raises the question Should Montoya have simply shot and cut together several great performances of his provocative play and given movie audiences the most authentic version of his commanding stylized vision?Either way theres a vital story at work here. It involves a pair of East L.A.-bred twin brothers -- ambitious state senator Gil (Enrique Murciano) and conflicted cop Gabe (Nicholas Gonzales) -- who were nicknamed ""Water"" and ""Power"" by their late DWP-employed father. Together these loyal carnales (brothers) face a dark night of the soul as factions from L.A.s gang culture law enforcement ranks and political worlds converge in a kind of imperfect storm. Past present and future are all brought to bear as a lyrical neo-noirish snapshot of the City of Angels Eastside-Westside divide plays out around them. As presented by Montoya theres a near-mythic quality to this cautionary tale and particularly to the characters of Water and Power. In fact from the poetic grandiose narration spoken by Norte/Sur (Emilio Rivera) a wheelchair-bound homeboy with a special tie to Gabe youd think these symbiotic twins were a kind of Chicano Romulus and Remus. To say the least things tend to be a bit overstated here. Photos A behind-the-scenes look at filming around the world for television and movies as seen from the streets. Then theres the kingly gray-tressed ""fixer"" Gil visits to bargain for Gabes life. As played in outsized fashion by veteran actor Clancy Brown hes a superbly conceived creation -- for the stage. On camera this ruthless powerbroker comes off as more caricature than character his foot-wash request more over-the-top icky than cleverly symbolic.An accomplished group of actors -- including Robert Beltran Roger Guenveur Smith Wanda De Jesus and the late great Lupe Ontiveros -- populate several police station scenes that attempt heft but also dont escape Montoyas theatrical hand. Photos Rejection in Hollywood can be infamous. We recap a few of Tinseltowns well-known roles that were initially or eventually offered to others. By Christy Khoshaba (By Christy Khoshaba) Still ""Water amp; Power"" remains a quintessential L.A. story that is worth seeing for what it has to say if not necessarily for how it says it. calendarlatimes.com---------------------------Water amp; PowerNo MPAA ratingRunning time 1 hour 28 minutesPlaying In limited release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Entertainment Reviews Richard Montoya Lupe Ontiveros Wanda De Jesus Roger Guenveur Smith The billion-dollar box office club ""Water amp; Power"" The Amazing Spider-Man 2 spins a tangled web Review Gugu Mbatha-Raw rises above an overstuffed script in Belle Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-water-and-power-review-20140503,0,1746461.story#axzz30q4cUJjI",200,water&power0,water&power,latimes

Water (Enrique Murciano) is a state senator while Power (Nicholas Gonzalez) is a star detective with the LAPD. The action follows the pair through one violent drug-fueled calamitous night when the past comes calling in that haunting way that it has. Visually Montoya makes the most of his break from the boards; the overhead shots of Los Angeles have more urgency and import than usual and there is good use of shadow for the sake of mood. But the mystical-mythical narration of this ""story of fathers sons and holy ghosts"" courtesy of a wheelchair-bound chronicler serves as a constant reminder of the stagy source as does dialogue like ""Weve told so many lies bro we forget which ones have turned back into the truth.""
