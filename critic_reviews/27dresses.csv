Twentieth Century Fox hide caption toggle caption Twentieth Century Fox Not exactly peachy Dresses fits Katherine Heigl like an ill-cut frock. Twentieth Century Fox Director Anne FletcherGenre Romantic ComedyRunning Time 107 minutes Katherine Heigl was a graceful presence in Knocked Up -- as graceful anyway as its possible to be in a muumuu and stirrups. And its perfectly natural for a performer to want to cross up expectations the next time out. But did Heigl have to go for a script as reductive and condescending as this one-joke comedy about being in love not with a person or even with love itself but with weddings? The premise is that a woman who has turned her closet into a shrine to her friends bad taste and marital extravagance -- with 27 variously ghastly bridesmaid dresses preserved as a monument to her own self-sacrifice -- is adorable as opposed to certifiable. The filmmakers have given her a suitor -- wedding reporter James Marsden who inexplicably thinks that writing about a girl with a closet full of bridesmaids dresses will be his ticket off the society pages and into hard news. And theyve surrounded the couple with something borrowed (Malin Akerman recycling her abrasive Bridezilla routine from Heartbreak Kid) something blue (a hangdog Ed Burns) and nothing remotely worth watching.

Its probably no coincidence that this recalls the mad dash at the beginning of Four Weddings.... Like Hugh Grants Charles Jane seems destined to attend all her friends weddings without ever getting hitched herself. A crush on her boss George (Edward Burns) could be the problem - especially as hes more keen on her sister (Malin Akerman). And so downtrodden Jane is doomed to play bridesmaid at the wedding of the man she loves. Or thinks she does - the love triangle doesnt end there. Enter James Marsden as journalist Kevin who writes a newspaper wedding column and is desperate for a juicy story about say a girl whos been a bridesmaid 27 times. As Kevin befriends Jane and takes advantage of her distress about George his duplicitousness is less than beguiling and yet hes still clearly in the running for the Mr Right contest.Its no compelling love story - Jane seems stuck between a rock and a hard place. But the film hops along merrily enough thanks to an engaging turn from Heigl whos nailed the unusually-pretty-girl-next-door act while embracing physical and risque comedy (Cameron Diaz comparisons abound). Judy Greer provides amusing support as the man-eating sibling. But while the humours irreverent and likeable this is no match for Heigls last comedy Knocked Up. Its official a pregnancy  is funnier than a wedding these days - on the big screen anyway.

Of course it keeps to the American formula for commercial rom-com.. ie . . . they hate each other in the opening reel and they realize they love each other in the final reel and this realization is given a public declaration . . . and everyone claps . . .And then theres the obligatory open-air wedding . . . ( The weathers always bettter in American films ) So not bad . . . doesnt get anywhere near a really classy film like `Notting Hill` . . . but if you see the DVD in a charity shop for APS3 . .its a reasonable deal . . . Probably one for the girls . . . as the male characters are not given any psychological or philosphical depth and are essentially `idealized` versions of what women see as `marriage material.`FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 5 2008SylFeaturedwell it doesnt suck that bad. there are a few scenes that makes you smile or even laugh. give the cast some credit they made a pretty decent movie here. )FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 5 2008ellieFeaturedThe most predictable pile of sappy poop I have seen in a long time Kinda amusing in parts but ou know exactly whats going to happen within the first ten minutes of the filmFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 29 2008HAYL3YxFeaturedThis Film Is Awesome SHUT THE HELL UP MOTHERPUCKERFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 29 2008HAYL3YxFeaturedThis Film Is Awesome SHUT THE HELL UP MOTHERPUCKERFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 25 2008AbiFeaturedThis Film Was Quite Predictable In Strange Ways...I Wont Give Away The Story Just Incase You Havent Yet Seen It But I Loved It It Was Really Funny And Girly Yet Suitable For Men.

In the case of ""Mad Money"" Ill write a short review because the movie wont sustain a long one. (It barely sustains itself.) See a clip from ""Mad Money."" The plot is simple to the point of perfunctory. Three women working as janitors in a Federal Reserve Bank perfect a scheme to steal piles of worn-out bills destined for destruction by shredding. Their method involves switching locks (the banks locks look like they came from a hardware store) then hiding the purloined currency first in garbage bags and later under their clothes. Seldom has the arm of coincidence been longer or shakier. But their heist is only the pretext for jinks that range from medium high (as played out by Queen Latifah and Diane Keaton) to painfully low (as perpetrated by Katie Holmes who pops her eyes scrunches her nose and shakes her booty in lieu of acting). If the movie gets by as it surely will during the current entertainment drought most of the credit should go to a couple of performers who come from different traditions yet share a gift for breathing life into moribund material. ENLARGE Queen Latifah a rapper and singer before she turned to acting does it with calm geniality a warm speaking voice unshakeable confidence and the timing of the accomplished musician that she is; often shell hang back half a beat from the rhythms of her dialogue. Diane Keaton does it with a lovely vivacity thats all the more affecting for the span of her stardom. Who could have imagined that the spring-fresh star of ""Annie Hall"" would be keeping it fresh three decades later? (Stephen Root is amusing as Glover the banks obsessive-compulsive security chief a role that might have been played seven decades earlier by Eric Blore.) ""Mad Money"" was directed by Callie Khouri from an airless script that Glenn Gers adapted from a British TV production called ""Hot Money."" The movie makes a stab at being a morality play Ms. Keatons cheerfully materialistic suburban matron Bridget is driven to devise the scheme when her husband loses his job while Queen Latifahs hard-working single mother Nina is anti-consumerist and a reluctant recruit. The real moral though springs from these two performances When all else fails verve will carry the day. 27 Dresses ENLARGE Always a bridesmaid? Katherine Heigl and James Marsden in 27 Dresses. Katherine Heigl carries ""27 Dresses"" when all else fails which it does with great regularity. The title refers to the contents of the heroines closet. Always a bridesmaid and never a bride Jane has served in that acolyte capacity at 27 weddings and has kept the clothes to prove it. This half-hatched chick flick which was directed in broad erratic strokes by Anne Fletcher asks us to accept Janes solemn dedication to the institution of marriage even though the early scenes staged as flat-out farce show her chasing like a lunatic between two bridesmaid gigs in different parts of town. Only belatedly and slapdashedly does Aline Brosh McKennas script come around to an awareness that Janes romantic illusions have something to do with her shaky self-esteem and her fear of commitment i.e. with psychology. WSJs Joe Morgenstern says Katherine Heigls charm is unable to mend ""27 Dresses."" Through it all though Ms. Heigl manages to make her character endearing as well as borderline-believable. Thats no small feat but neither is it an astonishment given the ostensibly effortless charm -- and more to the point the comedic skill -- she displayed last year as Alison the career girl who gets in the family-without-a-family way in ""Knocked Up."" Malin Akerman is Tess Janes younger sister and not a woman to be trusted. James Marsden who was so likable as the fatuous prince in ""Enchanted"" seems disenchanted here. He plays Kevin a journalist and an insufferable cynic about his beat which is weddings. As the writer of a newspaper column called ""Commitments"" he urges his editor to let him write a feature piece that will be he says fervently ""an incisive look at how the wedding industry has transformed something that should be a rite of passage into a corporate revenue stream."" The guy needs editing before he touches his keyboard. Taxi to the Dark Side A taxi driver is the central spectral figure of ""Taxi to the Dark Side"" a troubling often shocking documentary feature by Alex Gibney. The driver a young Afghani named Dilawar was taken into custody by American forces as a suspected terrorist on December 5 2002. He died five days later after intensive interrogation at the Bagram air base and a ""homicide"" box was checked on his death certificate which listed the cause of his death as blunt-force trauma. (Dilawars legs according to a coroners finding had been ""pulpified."") In Mr. Gibneys previous feature ""Enron The Smartest Guys In the Room"" the prevailing tone was freewheeling -- and entertaining -- irony. In this one its free-floating rage. Treating the taxi driver case as a Kafkaesque whodunit -- Dilawar had been fingered by a bounty hunter and was almost certainly a hapless innocent -- the film expands into a coolly furious polemic against the Bush administration and its policies on what does or does not constitute torture. From the ArchiveRead an interview with ""Taxi to the Dark Side"" director Alex Gibney. (4/28/07) By now many of the charges and countercharges will seem familiar or overfamiliar. And at times Dilawar gets lost in the swirl of larger events; the film will win no awards for neatness of structure. Still ""Taxi to the Dark Side"" adds something new to our awareness -- interviews with soldiers who served as interrogators in Afghanistan and in Iraqs notorious Abu Ghraib prison and who in some cases that ended in courts martial served prison terms themselves. And the film takes a surprising turn by evoking sympathy for these men as victims in their own right pressured by superiors who demanded results but failed to provide clear rules of conduct. Teeth During the opening sequence of Mitchell Lichtensteins ""Teeth"" the camera studies the twin stacks of a nuclear power plant surveys the suburban neighborhood that surrounds it and then takes us to the home of the films heroine a little girl named Dawn. When Dawn grows into a not-so-little girl played fetchingly by Jess Weixler she comes to realize that shes the living embodiment of the vagina dentata myth a mutant Lolita who does dreadful things to boys who disrespect her. Theres no scarier myth for males and Mr. Lichtenstein turns various images of emasculation into a black comedy that flirts fairly tediously with pornography. But you can also see his film if you choose -- and you wont -- as green. Dawn might have been spared her fate if shed grown up near a wind farm.    DVD TIP Diane Keaton directed ""Unstrung Heroes"" (1995) a beautiful coming-of-age comedy thats little-known by now and wasnt much better known when it first came out. Nathan Watt is Steven a 12-year-old with a sick mother (Andie MacDowell) and a remote father (John Turturro) who runs off to live with his eccentric uncles. Theyre played con gusto and brio by Michael Richards and Maury Chaykin. Richard LaGravenese adapted the script from the splendid memoir by Franz Lidz. Thomas Newmans score got a richly deserved Oscar nomination.

"27 Dresses Comedy left at the altar | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMovies27 Dresses Comedy left at the altar Katherine Heigl recently dissed her breakout hit Knocked Up for being ""a little sexist"" because it ""paints the women as shrews as humorless and uptight and it paints the men as goofy fun-loving guys ... ""By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Jan. 18 2008 Starring Katherine Heigl James Marsden Malin Akerman Edward Burns and Judy Greer. Directed by Anne Fletcher. At major theatres. 107 minutes. At major theatres. 14A  Katherine Heigl recently dissed her breakout hit Knocked Up for being ""a little sexist"" because it ""paints the women as shrews as humorless and uptight and it paints the men as goofy fun-loving guys ... ""Article Continued BelowHer comments to Vanity Fair magazine sound like ingratitude since Knocked Up vaulted her from the ensemble cast of TVs Greys Anatomy to Hollywood stardom with top billing and a per-picture salary of 6 million.Heigl also seems confused (or worse) about the definition of sexism since she posed for a series of cheesecake shots in the same mag. Her feminist convictions are further blurred by 27 Dresses her first star vehicle. Its an enlightened little movie that tells us every woman wants to wear nice gowns and marry Prince Charming even if she has to hide her intellect and stifle her real feelings to do that.Titled for the number of tacky bridesmaid dresses her character Jane has worn while playing the eternal bridesmaid to friends the movie shamelessly trades in the hoariest of chick-flick cliches.Jane loves weddings so much she never misses a chance to act as the dutiful and detail-obsessed bridesmaid for her hordes of friends sometimes attending as many as two weddings in a single evening.Poor Jane has yet to land a man of her own. Her real job is being the doting personal assistant to George (Edward Burns) a sporting goods mogul she cant get to notice her despite the best advice of her wise-cracking pal Casey (Judy Greer). Jane lacks the courage to reveal her real feelings to George even when her ditzy younger sister Tess (Malin Akerman) arrives from out of town and brazenly woos him away instantly transforming the confirmed bachelor into a marriage-minded romeo. It is possible Jane might soon be wearing her 28th bridesmaid dress?While shes inwardly seething at this turn of events Jane is blind to cynical newspaper writer Kevin played by James Marsden. Might Jane think differently about Kevin if she knew he was secretly the author of the marriage column in her favourite newspaper?Anyone who has the slightest doubt about where this movie is heading probably leads a full and rich life that doesnt include watching romantic comedies like My Best Friends Wedding which covered this same ground with a lot more verve and humour. Director Anne Fletcher doesnt know better or care since shes a choreographer by training and her previous helming exercise Step Up did nothing to advance either the rom-com or dance genres.But we might have expected more from screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna who penned The Devil Wears Prada with a good deal of savage wit and genuine insight into the shallowness of modern life.McKennas pen is blunted here by cheap gags about ""liking caulk"" (let your mind run wild) and that last resort of every desperate screenwriter the karaoke duet.The duet does reveal chemistry between Heigl and Marsden. But do you really think theyd be crooning to Elton Johns ""Benny and the Jets"" a novelty song released before either of them were born?It came out in 1973 when feminists were starting to complain about movies that make women look like wallflowers or man chasers.

Movie review ""27 Dresses"" with Katherine Heigl James Marsden Malin Ackerman Edward Burns Judy Greer. Directed by Anne Fletcher from a screenplay by Aline Brosh McKenna. 110 minutes. Rated PG-13 for language some innuendo and sexuality. Several theaters. A stale romantic comedy with taffeta for brains Anne Fletchers ""27 Dresses"" is fun for only one reason -- or to be more precise 27 of them. Jane (Katherine Heigl) is a serial bridesmaid and shes got a closetful of rainbow-hued polyester to prove it a shiny seaweedy-green sheath; a ""Gone with the Wind""-inspired crinoline; a pink-and-yellow explosion of tulle (sort of a dress version of a tropical drink); a scary peach frock with ribbons dangling all over it like car-wash rags; a form-fitting lavender halter gown with a horrid little matching purse like its demon seed. Costume designer Catherine Marie Thomas obviously had a ball whipping these things up -- but alas these dresses have way more personality than anyone else in the movie. You wonder if after-hours when the set was dark the dresses plotted to steal the movie from the actors. After all they do have top billing. Pretty much all of the humans in ""27 Dresses"" are ninnies. (In a battle of wits those dresses would win.) Not the least of these is nice-girl Jane whos been cherishing an unrequited crush on her dull boss George (Edward Burns) for many years despite the fact that he clearly sees her only as somebody who can pick up his dry cleaning. When George falls in instant and entirely implausible love with Janes visiting sister Tess (Malin Ackerman) Jane dutifully helps plan the wedding all the while ignoring Kevin (James Marsden playing it snarky) a wedding writer () who thinks Janes pretty adorable. Jane of course doesnt know that hes the writer whose ""Commitments"" column she moonily clips from the paper as he writes under a different name. Oh those crazy kids. Will they ever find love? Well if you can figure out how this story ends youve probably got better things to do than watch ""27 Dresses"" such as sit at home and wonder how Jane an executive assistant can afford the fabulous Manhattan apartment -- with closet space to hold all those dresses -- this movie gives her. (She must have the same realtor as Hilary Swank in ""P.S. I Love You."") Or whether the delightfully ditzy Judy Greer who gives the movies liveliest performance as Janes best friend Casey will ever get the leading role she deserves. Or whether Hollywood will ever make a great romantic comedy again. At this point Id settle for just a good one.

(AP Photo/Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation Barry Wetcher) Photo Barry Wetcher Review SWF w/ plenty of bridesmaid experience seeks marriage material 1 / 2 Back to Gallery 27 Dresses Romantic comedy. Starring Katherine Heigl Malin Akerman Edward Burns and James Marsden. Directed by Anne Fletcher. (PG-13. 107 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/ movies.) Katherine Heigl is amiable pleasant to look at and has comic ability and so on that basis ""27 Dresses"" is almost satisfying. In a romantic comedy half the ballgame is the charm of the lead actress and its no strain to spend 107 minutes in Heigls company. But then theres the other half of the ballgame - things like story and having characters that make sense and a resolution thats satisfying and a script that avoids cheap sentimentality. On those points ""27 Dresses"" collapses. Actually it collapses in slow motion. It gets worse and worse as it goes along and finally ends just as its becoming unbearable. Heigl does a lot of suffering in this movie and not all of it is fun to watch. She plays Jane an executive assistant who is madly but silently in love with her boss (Edward Burns) a great guy who is single athletic fantastically easygoing and (hows this for a 21st century aphrodisiac?) eco-friendly. One wretched day Janes selfish awful younger sister Tess (Malin Akerman) comes to town. Shes introduced to the boss and the two embark immediately on a horrible-to-watch whirlwind courtship/engagement. What makes it especially painful for Jane is that Tess is snagging her dream man on the basis of lies. Tess presents herself as an outdoorswoman a vegetarian and an animal lover when shes not any of those. Meanwhile Jane - because shes so giving because she cant say no because shes a sap - ends up working as an indentured servant for Tess planning her wedding. And the wedding Tess wants is the wedding that Jane has always dreamed of for herself. The title refers to the 27 dresses that Jane has in her closet the spoils of participating in the weddings of all her girlfriends always as a bridesmaid never a bride. Poor Jane. She gives gives gives and she gets gets gets ... nothing. The character and the setup present a problem for Heigl in that it forces her to be sad and passive the two precise things you dont want your lead character to be especially in a comedy. For an illustrative contrast check out ""Dan in Real Life"" which has a sexes-reversed version of the same situation - a man is in love with the girlfriend of his own brother. In that movie though the hero never does anything blatant never goes to his brother and announces his feelings the filmmaker keeps finding ways to activate the character. He might be sad and he might be frustrated but hes flailing not passive. He is driven to extremes. He doesnt withdraw into himself. Its the difference between bad comedy writing and good. James Marsden plays the other man in the movie a talented reporter stuck on the weddings beat. He hates it but in the course of his work he gets to know Jane and they develop a teasing sort of relationship based on the clash between his smirky cynicism and her romantic susceptibility. I know no one will care about his aside from people who work in newspapers but it must be said The presentation of the reporters work situation is ridiculous and unrealistic. At one point his editor asks to see the first draft of a wedding story before the reporter has finished his research. First off there wouldnt be a first draft. There would be nothing written until the reporting was done. Then the editor announces she likes it and wants to run it as is. He begs her not to. Why beg? Any reporter knows that if you dont want an editor to run something all you have to do is say that the facts probably arent right or that there might be something libelous in it. Instant hot rock. ""27 Dresses"" forces audiences to sit through the mild spectacle of Heigl moping for 80 minutes on the promise that sooner or later Jane will take revenge on the wicked sister. But the movie proves gutless. The revenge is mild its accompanying joy nonexistent and the hangover of regret is enormous. In fact all the plot elements that were encouraged to care about in ""27 Dresses"" resolve in a dud and the only thing that feels good about the feel-good finish is that it means the movies over. -- Advisory Adult talk and sexual situations.

Supportive of her married friends to the verge of masochism Heigls Jane Nichols is trapped not only in a succession of eyeball-gougingly ugly bridesmaid dresses but also in an ultra-formulaic romantic quadrangle with two men and her own sister. Aline Brosh McKenna the credited screenwriter spun the thin novel ""The Devil Wears Prada"" into comic gold. But she works no such alchemy here instead leaving no rom-com cliche unturned in her ""original"" script. Jane works as an assistant to George a personality-free clothing entrepreneur and philanthropist played by a wildly miscast Ed Burns. George is of course oblivious that Jane has a roaring crush on him but he quickly notices Janes airheaded and avaricious younger sister Tess (Malin Akerman) when she arrives in town for an extended visit. Before you know it George and Tess are engaged and the long-suffering Jane - what a surprise - is planning their wedding at The Boathouse in Central Park. Meanwhile Kevin (James Marsden better used as a second lead in ""Hairspray"" and ""Enchanted"") a cynical wedding reporter for ""the New York Journal"" is supposedly doing a piece on Tess and Georges wedding. What a shock - hes actually doing an expose on Janes career as a perennial bridesmaid. Stop the presses Anyone who has seen a chick flick knows what is going to happen next and next and next. They wont exactly be surprised when Jane and Kevin stop bickering long enough to lead a couple of choruses of ""Bennie and the Jets"" at a bar. Tess meanwhile is trying to con George into believing shes a vegetarian and a dog lover - so guess what the long-suffering Jane slips into a video at their pre-wedding dinner? Sidekicks tend to come off best in this sort of flick and Judy Greer makes a modest buffet of her role as Janes sardonic best friend. But there just isnt enough story here to justify a 107-minute running time no matter how many montages debuting director Anne Fletcher whips up. Heigl who demonstrates her gift for physical comedy has complained in interviews about the sexist tone of ""Knocked Up."" But what happens when she teams up with a woman director and screenwriter? You get ""27 Dresses"" which delivers that great feminist message A womans life is meaningless without marriage. 27 DRESSES Something borrowed. Running time 107 minutes. Rated PG-13 (sexual innuendo profanity).

Elizabeth Weitzman Tuesday June 3 2008 1146 AM 27 Dresses. Romantic comedy about a perennial bridesmaid. With Katherine Heigl James Marsden. Director Anne Fletcher (147). PG-13 Language sexuality. At area theaters.It always starts innocently enough A friend gets engaged promising to pick out a bridesmaid dress youll definitely wear again. Months later youre walking down the aisle in a beribboned atrocity that cost 400 and requires a rib-altering bustier (or and I speak from personal experience a Scarlett OHara hoop skirt).There is a movie to be made from that shared humiliation - actually there are many and they already litter the shelves of Blockbuster. So at this point the question is whether ""27 Dresses"" has anything new to add. And the answer is a resounding no. But if youve got your own closetful of taffeta disasters you may well enjoy it anyway. Despite the only-in-Hollywood casting an endearing Katherine Heigl tries valiantly to sell herself as plain Jane a wallflower in love with her boss George (Ed Burns). A die-hard romantic Jane spends her free time helping friends plan their weddings - 27 of them so far - while fantasizing about her own. As if thats not depressing enough George is engaged to Janes superficial sister Tess (Malin Akerman). A cynical reporter (James Marsden) has been assigned to write their wedding announcement but hes secretly working on another story - about a certain pathetic perennial bridesmaid. As carefully calculated as any element of the billion-dollar bridal industry ""27 Dresses"" tears Jane down only to build her back up. By the end youre bound to root for this woman to get her dream wedding even though she has no real prospects. Because in their rush to the altar both writer Aline Brosh McKenna and director Anne Fletcher seem to have overlooked the needs of the groom (aint it always the way?). Marsdens natural charisma is totally wasted in an unlikable role while Burns doesnt even try to hide his boredom. Of course even the most generic wedding can be redeemed by a glowing bride and Heigl is downright radiant throughout. But anyone watching this appealing actress march toward the inevitable will wonder why shes settling for so much less than she deserves. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

At one point the heroine yanks out her kaleidoscopic stash of bridesmaid get-ups from a huuuuge overstuffed closet and tries them on one after another for the hero. The olive-satin number. The hideous yellow antebellum period frock with roses. The slutty pink microdress for a left-coast wedding. The kimono. The cliches like the dresses sashay in and out of this predictable if nicely fluffy chick-flick composite which manages to crank out a few decent laughs when it isnt wasting time on a pair of deadly supporting characters. Admire the heroines sloshed barroom transmutation of Elton Johns Benny and the Jets. Enjoy her forceful enunciation of the word ""mother"" more or less at a 50th anniversary party full of stunned attendees. And witness the sequence in a New York taxi as she changes in and out and in and out of two gowns (the gray sheath; the colorful sari) for two concomitant weddings while a flustered cabbie tries and fails not to peek. If you think thats cute meet the heroine Katherine Heigl as Jane the eternal bridesmaid the good egg with too much experience supporting other women (or their trains) on their walk down the aisle (or their sit on the potty). Heigl swirls just the right mixture of saccharine and spice for the role which requires her to seem aggravated by the state of things but still inexplicably hopeful. She is despite all those plunging necklines in her closet such a sop for matrimony that she clips and saves articles from the wedding pages. Enter the hero. Hes cute too Kevin Doyle (resplendent grinner James Marsden) the guy whos been writing all those puff pieces. But he uses a pen name so she doesnt realize hes actually gathering intel for a Sunday profile -- some big piece about Jane her many gawdy dresses and her unwitting victimization by the profit-driven event-planning industry. This reportorial sneakiness puts a retro spin on Kevin -- who does he think he is Gregory Peck in Roman Holiday? -- and sparks up the combative goofball banter between the leads. In her second film (after the pouty but watchable Step Up) director Anne Fletcher teams with screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna -- who adapted The Devil Wears Prada another sleek New York femme flick with a journalistic theme. This one lacks a spine which is to say it lacks Meryl Streep. But Heigl and Marsden bring a feint-and-parry chemistry to their scenes together and when theyre up there being sassy and argumentative and you know cute -- well the movie works just fine. If only it didnt have that unconvincing sub-par sub-plot which trots out blah characters and weak twists that include Im not kidding vacuum-cleaning. I understand why the script gives Jane an obnoxious twiggy sister (Malin Akerman) and a dreamboat boss (Edward Burns) and I understand why it throws them together. But Burns looks bored. To death. Im really worried about him. And Akerman -- Im sorry but she has to stop shaking her head in that witchy little slap-me-Im-acting maneuver. She did the same thing in virtually the same role in The Heartbreak Kid and its getting tired. Judy Greer meanwhile is wide-awake as Janes smut-talking co-worker and chief adviser in all things man-related. The zippy-quippy sidekick is a regulation character part in romantic comedies but Greer nails it -- and anyway everything in 27 Dresses is regulation. It sticks to its pattern like a sheer organdy petticoat. When the climax arrives and the schmaltz is dished out and the love is declared before total strangers youll know youve worn something like it before. Its one more dress to shove in the closet. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Sinwood Indoor Electric UV Insect Zapper for 29 + free shipping Open-Box Wolfgang Puck 22L Pressure Oven for 70 + free shipping Intex Waterproof Twin Airbed Mattress for 5 + pickup at Walmart Dell Celeron Dual 12"" Touch 2-in-1 Laptop for 195 + free...

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor January 18 2008 Save for later Saved Jane (Katherine Heigl) tries on one of her 27 Dresses. The film which also stars Edward Burns and James Marsden is built out of an assortment of familiar romantic comedy tropes.

If you have you might find it amusing to tally up the steals - I mean homages.Whats unusual about ""27 Dresses"" is that it doesnt only filch from good movies it also poaches the bad stuff. This is a movie that was practically inspired by ""The Runaway Bride.""Still its January folks and any studio picture released this early in the year is almost by definition a dud. And so Im pleased to report that ""27 Dresses"" while it isnt good exactly is no stinker. By January standards it might even be said to be OK. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? The main reason the movie is tolerable to sit through is Katherine Heigl who plays Jane Nichols always a bridesmaid never a bride. Janes mother died when she was young and ever since then shes been the perfect helper to everyone from her younger sister Tess (Malin Akerman) to her large supply of marriageable female friends - 27 to be exact. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? 27 romantic comedy cliches Shes also the perfect assistant to her wealthy boss George (Edward Burns) who runs an outdoor equipment company. In a shocking plot development we discover that Jane is hopelessly in love with George who of course is clueless about her infatuation.Enter Kevin (James Marsden) a roguish newspaper columnist who in the real world would be writing nasty gossip but here is consigned to his papers ""Weddings"" section. He has a soulful flair for writing up wedding announcements even though he claims to be cynical about marriage. In another shocking narrative twist it turns out that hes really a cream puff when it comes to romance.The object of his ardor is of course Jane who at first cant stand him. Hes almost creepily persistent though. They end up bonding in a roadhouse bar after their car breaks down in a storm and proceed to wail Elton Johns ""Benny and the Jets"" while the improbably ruly patrons gleefully chime in.Jane and Kevin may not have ""met cute"" but they bond cute.Since all romantic comedies have to have ""heart"" - i.e. heartbreak - Tess arrives on the scene to scoop up Janes one true love George.Soon they are engaged even though Tess a layabout with a taste for Eurotrashy men has lied to him about her past. Once again George supposedly a man of the world is clueless about what women want. And Jane ever the helpmate becomes her sisters bridesmaid.This is the kind of movie where the audience is meant to recognize the heroines one true love even before she does. Its obvious that Jane and Kevin were meant for each other which is why it takes almost the entire movie for them - or more exactly her - to realize it. She even gets to act out that hoariest of scenes - the one where the girl kisses the guy shes supposed to be in love with (George) and realizes the sparks just arent there.Heigl a regular on ""Greys Anatomy"" made her big movie splash in ""Knocked Up"" and her sunny insipidity helped to leaven some of that films raunchiness. She was charming in that film and shes delightful in ""27 Dresses"" too although director Anne Fletcher overdoes the smiling-through-tears close-ups.Heigl doesnt need the camera to do her work for her. Shes a bit like Amy Adams - Hollywoods other It girl. They both radiate a sweetness that cant be faked (or at least theyre doing a great job faking it).As her wisecracking co-worker Judy Greer has the best lines and she knows how to deliver them. Marsden who was the cartoonishly handsome prince opposite Adams in ""Enchanted"" does a variation on that role here. Akerman is a one-note temptress but then again her role is barely a grace note.Like I said its January. You want good? Wait until the spring.

"Wedding bell blues take a toll on 27 Dresses - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsReal EstateLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review Wedding bell blues take a toll on 27 Dresses Katherine Heigl plays for keeps in uneven comedy Email|Print| Text size - + By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / January 18 2008 Katherine Heigl is who Charlize Theron wants to be when she dresses down. Thats not a comment on Heigls talent (we still dont know if shes any kind of actress) or on Therons for that matter (we know she is). But Heigl has the normal good looks that Theron descends from Olympus to pull off when shes playing deathly San Franciscans or sexually harassed miners. Heigl is not a goddess. Shes very appealing but not chic or cool which for so-so romantic comedies is an advantage. She isnt slumming so you believe in her.Heigl has a regular part on TVs ""Greys Anatomy"" and her first movie since playing Seth Rogens baby mama in ""Knocked Up"" is ""27 Dresses"" a sporadically entertaining cupcake of a movie. She plays Jane a perennial bridesmaid/matron of honor (27 times) who openly longs for a wedding of her own. Jane is practical responsible and a bit single-minded. When she gets her Sunday paper she skips right past the other sections and goes straight to the Vows department. Thats her idea of news.The first batch of scenes is a giddy whirlwind. Jane is somehow serving in two concurrent ceremonies and she hires a taxi to shuttle her between them. The movie conflates the two cutting back and forth as if the separate events were one with Michael Jacksons ""Dont Stop Til You Get Enough"" holding it all together. We see the blissfully banal rituals (the YMCA the electric slide the speeches the brides who need their dresses held while they go to the bathroom.) Heigl is at the center of the madness smiling stressing rolling her eyes. This is fun. Its almost as well engineered a sequence as that montage in ""Wedding Crashers"" where Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson drink dance and score.But ""27 Dresses"" is determined to go downhill from there. It promptly becomes a plain old romantic comedy. The movie makes way for Janes sister Tess (Malin Akerman) an azure-eyed blond who predictably enough is a nincompoop to steal the man Jane loves but hasnt told. Its George (Edward Burns) her boss. Soon George and Tess are engaged and guess whos planning the wedding. Meanwhile Jane is being hounded by Kevin (James Marsden) the cute newspaper reporter on the weddings beat. He hates his job and figures Janes life as a bridesmaid would make for the sort of feature that could catapult him out of the ""taffeta ghetto."" Of course Kevin is secretly writing about her while pretending to cover Tesss wedding. The movie is as overwritten as it sounds.Heigl and Marsden are good together nonetheless - never more so than when they drunkenly belt out ""Bennie and the Jets"" atop a bar. Hes got an interesting face - all sharp small features. Its like a caricature of movie-star handsomeness. In ""Enchanted"" you buy him as a joke on Prince Charming but youd never buy him as the prince himself. That is of course his romantic appeal He comes in under the radar.The movie has a number of good tough scenes a few of which are at Janes expense. In one she walks into a restaurant and the waiters unfurl a banner that says ""Will you marry me?"" some musicians start playing that insipid romantic restaurant music and she almost dies. When George tells them to stop -""Shes not the one. Shes not the one."" - Jane almost dies again. You feel for her. And then you dont. Who could so desperately love a man as dull as Edward Burns? His dreaminess is like a studio backdrop. You pull away the gorgeous imagery and theres a wall.Theres a decent movie in here somewhere. Sometimes its just vulgar enough thanks in large part to Judy Greer who as Janes randy best friend is the Thelma Ritter of this operation. But the director Anne Fletcher and the screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna who did such a smart job adapting ""The Devil Wears Prada"" have made a ditsy single-chick movie with the alluring geometry of a screwball comedy. The movies kiss of death comes when Jane tries on the 27 dresses for Kevin in the sort of exasperatingly cute montage that Raven-Symone and Miley Cyrus seem way too old to try.

Here are actors radiating more star power than legally should be allowable in a movie so predictable that the audience knows what the characters will say before they do. Didnt see the ""Benny and the Jets"" karaoke coming though. Heigl is Jane a Manhattan executive assistant whose biggest fear is that the saying ""always the bridesmaid never the bride"" will prove prophetic. Crammed inside her closet are 25 bridesmaid gowns suitable for Halloween. After a Saturday doubleheader where she shuttles between Manhattan and Brooklyn nuptials performing double duty as planner and attendant she needs to make room for two more. Call her the Wedding Masher. Marsden (the jut-jawed Prince of Enchanted Corny Collins in Hairspray) is Kevin the guy who writes the ""Commitments"" column in the New York Journal and sees Jane everywhere. In private if not in print he is contemptuous of the ""bridal industry"" that emphasizes the nuptials at the expense of what happens after. Call him the Wedding Trasher. Tired of the sideshow Jane wants to be the main event. But instead of putting herself out there like her best friend Casey (Judy Greer with bitch-perfect tone) Jane pines for her boss George (Ed Burns) who treats doormats better than his assistant. Predictably George falls for Janes younger sister Tess (Malin Akerman) hot and flaky as Jane is cool and collected. Naturally Tess who has no trouble expressing what she wants wants Jane to plan her wedding and buy that 28th attendants dress. Its hard to watch Heigl a brusque honey blonde who exudes sexual confidence like no one since Carole Lombard play second fiddle however briefly. Yet since My Best Friends Wedding Hollywood has specialized in movie comedies where the heroine is repeatedly chastised by friends and family about how unassertive wrongheaded and jerky she is. This occurs throughout 27 Dresses and it occurs throughout The Devil Wears Prada a much better and more ambiguous film by 27 Dresses scribe Aline Brosh McKenna. Does the Hollywood comedy heroine have to be humiliated into self-awareness? ""Avoiding humiliation is at the core of comedy and tragedy"" noted playwright John Guare. But for heroines of Hollywood rom-coms humiliation is unavoidable. In 27 Dresses Jane is harshed for being selfless and harshed some more for being selfish. No self-respecting screenwriter would put a Hugh Grant character through what Heigls endures here. I dont blame McKenna I blame a studio system that figures if it worked for Julia Roberts it will work for Heigl. Much as I gnashed my teeth during 27 Dresses I genuinely enjoyed the warmth of Heigls and Marsdens confident ease. While both might be a few minutes past their star-is-born moment these troupers with more than 30 years of professional work between them have never shone so brightly. It may sound contradictory but loved them hated it. The film is competently directed by Anne Fletcher the onetime choreographer who designed the love-in that climaxed The 40-Year-Old Virgin and made her directing debut with the inner-city dance-off Step Up.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com Read her blog ""Flickgrrl"" at http//go.philly.com/flickgrrl/.

Movies 27 Dresses No Bouquets for the Bridesmaid Video27 DressesKatherine Heigl and James Marsden star in this romantic comedy about a woman who tired of being a bridesmaid faces the prospect of watching the man she loves marry her sister. Showtimes >> LAUNCH VIDEO PLAYER Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday January 18 2008 After a notable feature debut in ""Knocked Up"" Katherine Heigl makes an official bid for Americas Sweetheart in her sophomore effort ""27 Dresses"" a romantic comedy that -- despite her undeniable apple-cheeked appeal -- sags like a day-old bouquet. This StoryMovies 27 Dresses No Bouquets for the BridesmaidProfile Katherine HeiglTrailer 27 Dresses Heigl plays Jane a hardworking Manhattan administrative assistant who gives new meaning to the term ""always a bridesmaid."" Turns out ""27 Dresses"" refers to the number of weddings in which she has served in that thankless capacity including two that in a preposterous early sequence occur on the same night. Its during that completely illogical series of scenes that Jane meets Kevin (James Marsden) a cute guy with his own interest in nuptials who begins to pursue Jane even though shes in love with her boss (Edward Burns). Things get -- well not interesting but thingier when Janes supermodel little sister Tess (Malin Akerman) shows up throwing an extroverted platinum-blond spanner into the already shaky works. Its at this point that ""27 Dresses"" becomes a movie not about people or relationships but about cute apartments and cuter outfits to which Janes adorable wardrobe of skirts divertingly attests. There is not one surprising charming or endearingly quirky thing about ""27 Dresses"" which hews to the rom-com formula with bland regimented precision. This is a movie that actually invokes the term ""Bridezilla"" as if its a brand-new idea instead of a ready-for-retirement cliche; Jane even has a smart-mouthed sidekick played by the often wonderful Judy Greer with visions of Emily Blunts brilliantly blase turn in ""The Devil Wears Prada"" clearly dancing in her head. (As it happens ""27 Dresses"" was written by ""Prada"" screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna.) Its not that Heigl isnt terrific -- as her fans from ""Greys Anatomy"" know she has what it takes to make viewers care about her even if her blond perfection would usually make them (okay half of them) want to wring her flawlessly swanlike neck. (For his part Marsden fresh from his amusingly dim turn in ""Enchanted"" is unobjectionable and little else.) But you know even her warmth and vulnerability cant save ""27 Dresses"" when the movies central set piece -- a montage in which Jane tries on all of the titular gowns whose styles range from cowgirl to geisha to Southern belle -- slumps into an anticlimactic heap. Director Anne Fletcher is best known in Hollywood as a choreographer for such productions as ""Step Up"" and the recent ""Walk Hard"" which makes it all the more surprising that her staging in that scene falls so flat. Similarly when Jane and Kevin break out in a drunken version of ""Benny and the Jets"" atop a roadhouse bar counter the scene plays as if it were extruded from some vast pipe works hidden deep under Hollywood. ""27 Dresses"" notwithstanding Heigl has a bright big-screen future ahead of her -- as long as she snags the right material and as long as that material doesnt come with matching shoes. 27 Dresses (107 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for profanity some sexuality and innuendo. >> This StoryRead +|Watch +| Comments (c) 2008 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  27 Dresses No Bouquets for the Bridesmaid Profile Katherine Heigl Trailer 27 Dresses",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/17/AR2008011703244.html,200,27dresses19,27dresses,washingtonpost

That recycling aesthetic is the guiding principle of the film which re-uses every tired plot twist in the wedding-comedy pattern book. It should have been shortened more. A lot more. Heigl brings a game dedication to the part of Jane a Manhattan eternal bridesmaid hopelessly infatuated with her boss George (Ed Burns). She has adored him from close range for years patiently waiting for him to notice and return her ardor dreaming of the day they will drive off into the sunset in a hail of confetti streamers and rice. George amiable but dense sees her as nothing more than the nice colleague who fetches his coffee so cheerfully. So as a singleton lacking a social life Jane has become the go-to girl for friends who need some reliable backup on their wedding day. In hopes of attracting positive matrimonial juju perhaps Jane has kept all 27 bridesmaid gowns in her closet a collection of fashion misfortunes that would give ""Project Runways"" Tim Gunn an aneurysm. Giving her dreams of nuptial nirvana a reality check is Kevin (James Marsden) a wry writer. Little does Jane know hes the author of the chic newspaper wedding notices column that helps fuel her romantic fantasies. Having professionally observed orgies of wedding-day excess for years hes understandably jaded about giving such a momentous launch to relationships that have a 50-50 chance of enduring. A more serious roadblock to Janes imagined happily-ever-after is her glamorous sister Tess (Malin Akerman) who dazzles George and pounces on him bearing him toward the altar in her talons. Will Tess hijack Janes dream marriage? Will the curmudgeonly Kevin be the real Mr. Right? Or will his article lampooning her wedding fixation drive a permanent wedge between them? Heigl was luminous in last summers ""Knocked Up"" but the mushy passivity of this part and Anne Fletchers lackluster direction put her at a fatal disadvantage. Burns looks almost morose as the easygoing blob George; its the sort of thankless part that Ralph Bellamy would have played in the 30s. 27 DRESSES  out of 4 stars The setup A New York City singleton (Katherine Heigl) pines for her boss (Ed Burns) while fending off the advances of a cynical writer (James Marsden). What works Heigl is a likable performer even in substandard material. What doesnt The picture is too drawn out and the emotions are troweled on like wedding-cake frosting. Great scene Marsden and Heigl do a drunken song and dance on the countertop of a roadhouse bar. Rating PG-13 for language innuendo and sexuality. Only Marsdens cynical reporter and Judy Greer as Janes prickly quick-witted pal seem to be having any fun. ""27 Dresses"" could have come alive if someone had the idea of matching up those two sharp-tongued magpies but thats expecting too much imagination from a movie that is as conventional and formula-bound as a traditional wedding ceremony. Whatever originality there is in ""27 Dresses"" is awfully small maybe size 1. Too bad they didnt accessorize it with more creativity.

"27 Dresses - LA Times Los Angeles Times 27 Dresses 27 Dresses Barry Wetcher / 20th Century Fox Katherine Heigl tries on her bridesmaid dress. Katherine Heigl tries on her bridesmaid dress. (Barry Wetcher / 20th Century Fox) Carina ChocanoLos Angeles Times Staff Writer KATHERINE HEIGL is always the bridesmaid and never the bride in this garden-variety wedding-themed rom-com -- except here never means later as it should alarm nobody to learn. In this and in every other way I can think of ""27 Dresses"" adheres steadfastly to formula setting up its complications like bowling pins and resolving them to the utmost satisfaction of everyone involved no hard feelings no regrets absolutely no surprises.This presumably is what we flock to romantic comedies for (if it can be called flocking) -- some kind of ritualistic reassurance that no matter how grim a persons romantic prospects love eventually does come to those who wait. As long as they wait in spacious professionally decorated New York apartments and are attractive enough that it takes the dazzling brunt of a knockout Swede in a microscopic dress to make them look like average Janes by comparison. As coincidence would have it Heigls character happens to be named Jane and she lives in a lovely one-bedroom with enough closet space to permanently house a small museum collection of taffeta and tulle atrocities. (No wonder shes in love with her boss -- he must pay her a fortune for manning his schedule and picking up his dry cleaning.) Her boss the droopy-eyed George (Edward Burns) has no idea how she feels but before she can work up the nerve to tell him he falls instantly in love with her younger sister Tess (Malin Akerman) who wouldnt you know it happens to be a knockout Swede in a microscopic dress.Once the George and Tess romance is set in motion the kind and dutiful Jane has no option but to take charge of their upcoming wedding and plan the whole thing herself because she has been established as the kind of girl who takes care of everyone but herself and who double-books weddings and spends Saturday nights shuttling back and forth between them. The two dozen or so dear friends for whom shes ostensibly done the same are only ever seen in fleeting moments -- maybe this is why she hangs on to the dresses; its all she has to remember them by. Janes only real friend is Casey (Judy Greer) a morose churl whose active sex-and-drinking life apparently leaves her unable to talk above an exhausted drawl or walk in a straight line. It may be that paradoxes such as these are meant to prime us for the even greater contradictions to come but its more likely that they are by now so entrenched in the genre that they have become functionally invisible to the naked eye. With their strict adherence to a particular kind of formula studio romantic comedies serve as reassurance delivery systems rather than actual stories and criticizing them feels a little like taking a Big Mac to task for the quality of the meat. The meat isnt the point. The point is the familiarity and the homogeny and the taste-masking sauces and the sugar in the bun.""27 Dresses"" which was directed by Anne Fletcher and written by Aline Brosh McKenna who also wrote ""The Devil Wears Prada"" falls somewhere in the middle of the dozens of hard-to-recall pictures it somehow nevertheless recalls. Its premise not only hinges on a pun play on words or cliche it clings to it for dear life. In this case its the old bridesmaid adage which though it remains tacit for most of the film haunts it like a poltergeist. She reads bridal magazines to relax she keeps a Filofax full of clippings and wedding contacts her favorite writer is a newspaper journalist who writes wedding announcements. She is single-mindedly wedding-mad in that way that looks cute in romantic comedies but would not go un-medicated in real life.The journalist is Kevin Doyle (James Marsden) whom she meets cute at (where else?) a wedding and who unbeknownst to Jane starts working on a story about her bridesmaid compulsion. No sooner has he pitched her to his editor than he starts to develop feelings. But Janes gut tells her that they are a mismatch (she loves weddings he hates them lets call the whole thing off) and she remains unreceptive to his charms until they find themselves stranded in a bar upstate having been caught in the rain not quite drinking pina coladas but almost.""27 Dresses"" perks up when Jane and Kevin get to spend some time together; theres genuine annoyance between them so you can feel the spark. The rest of the relationships feel symbolic at best with every character reduced to a single defining trait and limited to his or her talking points. Heigl and Marsden are likable and its not hard to root for them over a pairing with Burns whose eco-adventurer-mogul character is as exciting as ski socks. Greer however is baffling as the village slut and Akerman gets put through the ringer as the ditzy self-involved selfish younger sister who were supposed to like then hate then like again.Of course this is hard to do considering that she exists solely as a foil for Jane whose big climactic decision turns out to be a stunningly hostile act of public humiliation that were this any kind of real film would have the effect of changing the way we feel about her as a character. Instead ""27 Dresses"" dutifully privileges its formulaic plot over its stick-figure characters slapping a happy ending on a setup that say ""Happiness"" director Todd Solondz could have gone to town on. Still theres something undeniably interesting about how formula has superseded logic significance or character in so much studio product that certain types of genre stories have become closed circuits infinite loops. Do we need to keep hearing the same comforting story over and over again like toddlers or does somebody just think we do? It doesnt matter. A movie like ""27 Dresses"" has its pleasures but to enjoy them its best to approach it with the eyes -- and experience emotional maturity level and love of repetition -- of a child.carina.chocanolatimes.com""27 Dresses.""

"27 Dresses | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; 27-dresses ) 27 Dresses (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli I have no idea why the people who decide such matters have elected to release this perfect Valentines Day movie in the middle of January. Perhaps its counter-programming for Cloverfield. Whatever the case 27 Dresses is an illustration of what can result when the filmmakers possess a solid understanding of the romantic comedy formula and decide never to stray from it by one iota. Theres not a surprising moment in the movie yet it works in spite of the stale insipid storyline. That has a lot to do with lead actress Katherine Heigl and a little to do with the glowing embers between her and her co-star James Marsden. Take away these two and their low-key chemistry and there would be little here worth seeing. If theres a romantic comedy clichA(c) missed by choreographer-turned-director Anne Fletcher and her screenwriting cohort Aline Brosh McKenna (who previously penned the smarter and edgier adaptation of The Devil Wears Prada) during the course of assembling 27 Dresses Im not sure what it is. Then again most viewers who pay money to see this will not be on a quest for originality. As Ive stated before all a picture like this needs to succeed are charming actors who convince us theyre in love. Everything else is beside the point. The central romance is a paint-by-numbers affair but we like the characters and root for them to become locked in a passionate embrace as the end credits roll. Smiles at the end are forgivable; less so the scowls of die-hard cynics (who shouldnt be seeing this in the first place). However while the main thrust of the movie reaches its target at the climax the secondary storyline is resolved in a perfunctory unsatisfactory manner apparently designed to increase the saccharine quotient to an impressively high level. Sugar shock alert. The story is simple enough as befits an entry into a genre where dense plots are few and far between. Jane (Heigl) is an amateur wedding planner. She loves weddings relishing the fairy tale atmosphere. Her favorite thing is to watch the grooms face as he gazes upon his bride approaching him at the altar. Janes day job is as an assistant to an advertising exec George (Edward Burns) but her real passion lies in helping all her friends and colleagues arrange perfect ceremonies. Shell do anything to help from standing in for a busy bride at the gown fitting (if she happens to be the same size) to negotiating with the cake baker. She has been a bridesmaid 27 times and hopes that some day her prince will come. Shes in love (the unrequited kind) with George but lacks the courage to tell him. Enter her fun-loving globe-trotting slut of a sister Tess (Malin Akerman) who sweeps George off his feet. After a whirlwind courtship the two are engaged and Jane is faced with the bittersweet prospect of planning her sisters wedding to the man she loves. Complicating matters is Kevin (James Marsden) the Wedding Announcements writer for the New York Journal who is intrigued by Janes history and wants to write a piece about her (without her knowledge). The two are like oil and water which of course means the attraction will eventually become too strong to deny. That moment happens when they both have a little too much to drink and sing Elton Johns ""Benny and the Jets."" Heigl is the perfect romantic comedy lead - shes attractive energetic likeable and willing to get raunchy if needed. 27 Dresses is more tame than Knocked Up but shes no less appealing. She understands comedic timing and knows how to bring real emotion to scenes that could otherwise feel completely scripted. If she continues to do these movies her popularity could surpass that of former title holders Julia Roberts and Reese Witherspoon. James Marsden isnt quite as magnetic but he displays more charisma here than in either X-Men or Superman Returns and he interacts well with Heigl. He also understands that this is her movie and doesnt try to steal scenes from her. For Malin Akerman this is the second consecutive outing in which she defines ""insufferable"" (following The Heartbreak Kid). The concern isnt just that she is becoming typecast but that shes too good in this kind of part. She is nails-on-the-blackboard annoying in 27 Dresses. Edward Burns and Judy Greer (in the thankless ""best friend"" role) hang around in the background until called upon to utter the occasional line or two. Part of me enjoyed 27 Dresses in the same way I occasionally like to down a handful of chocolate covered raisins. Theyre not filling or nourishing but they provide a moments forgettable pleasure. Heigls appeal and talent elevate this to a little above the romantic comedy noise and while its strictly for self-appointed aficionados of the genre there will be those who adore what Fletcher and her cast have wrought. Nevertheless it puzzles me why such an obvious date movie was released a month before the ultimate date night of the year. Then again this is from an industry that thinks summer begins on May 1 and Labor Day weekend is the perfect opening for something called Halloween. So enjoy 27 Dresses limited charms for what they are rather for when they are on display. This isnt a great movie but it fills a niche. 27 Dresses (United States 2008) Director Anne Fletcher Cast Katherine Heigl James Marsden Edward Burns Malin Akerman Judy Greer Screenplay Aline Brosh McKenna Cinematography Peter James Music Randy Edelman U.S. Distributor 20th Century Fox Run Time 148 U.S. Release Date 2008-01-18 MPAA Rating ""PG-13"" (Profanity Sexual Situations) Genre ROMANTIC COMEDY Subtitles none Theatrical Aspect Ratio 2.351 Comments Add Comment Three...better movies of this genre Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008) When Harry Met Sally (1989) Kissing Jessica Stein (2002) worse movies of this genre Hottie and the Nottie The (2008) Just Friends (2005) Runaway Bride (1999) Three...better movies of Katherine Heigl Knocked Up (2007) (There are no more better movies of Katherine Heigl) worse movies of Katherine Heigl My Father the Hero (1994) Life as We Know It (2010) Big Wedding The (2013) Three...better movies of James Marsden Superman Returns (2006) Enchanted (2007) Hairspray (2007) worse movies of James Marsden Bachelorette (2012) Unfinished Business (2015) Welcome to Me (2015) Three...better movies of Edward Burns Saving Private Ryan (1998) (There are no more better movies of Edward Burns) worse movies of Edward Burns One Missed Call (2008) Echelon Conspiracy (2009) Holiday The (2006) ReelViews Library Currently in Cinema Writings Fictional Writings ReelThoughts Specials About Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions Contact Website credits",http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=612,200,27dresses23,27dresses,reelviews

Jane (Katherine Heigl) is the perennial sad singleton lonely but eternally hopeful. Shes in love with her boss (Ed Burns) who treats her like the worlds most lovingly cared-for doormat and she has been an eager and devoted bridesmaid 27 times with her leftover dresses -- in all their fruit-hued puffy-sashed prom-discard plumage -- lined up in the closet to prove it. You already know him too. Kevin (James Marsden) is the jaunty solo male unlassoed by love who somehow manages to pen the tenderhearted ""Commitments"" column in the Sunday wedding section of the New York Journal. Staring him in the eye she asks Does he really feel all those warm sincere special-day sentiments? Or is he just a cynic spooning out ""romantic crap"" for women like her? Thats a question you could well ask the people who concocted 27 Dresses screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna who previously wrote the hit screen adaptation of The Devil Wears Prada and director Anne Fletcher a veteran choreographer who turned filmmaker with Step Up (2006). Its not that their movie is cynical; its that all the chick-flick trappings -- the fashion the wedding chitchat the masochistic one-way crush -- drive the story rather than the other way around. 27 Dresses is a movie geared to a pitch of high matrimonial-princess fever. Its white-lace porn for girls of every age and the way that it revelsin that get-me-to-the-altar mood to the point of making anyone who isnt getting married feel like a loser is the pictures key selling point. McKenna and Fletcher at moments give good romantic fluff and they offer a few tweaks -- though not enough -- of the poshly retro-traditional multibillion-dollar wedding industry. There are also winning performers on screen like Katherine Heigl who knows how to glow right through her professional-woman composure. She soft-pedals her sexiness with just the right touch of exasperation. Heigl amid the friendly mishegoss of Knocked Up signified as a nearly generic shiksa goddess but really shes a far more exotic actress than that. Her face is all ovals and darting eyes -- shes got some of the nervous high-strung sensuality of the young Kathleen Turner -- and she makes Jane a live presence even if its a bit much to ask us to believe that a woman this attractive could be this nerdishly self-sacrificing a sop. And yet merely by writing that line I have revealed how completely removed I am from the target audience for this movie. As far as theyre concerned if 27 Dresses were ""better"" it probably wouldnt be as good. It wouldnt have that guilty-pleasure how-I-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-cheese frisson that has become the defining spirit of the 21st-century chick flick. McKennas script melts together a couple of cookie-cutter plots. In the first Janes dim-bulb duplicitous baby-doll sister the platinum bimbo Tess (Malin Akerman) snares the boss that Jane has spent years adoringly stepping and fetching for. Will Tess now get to enjoy the perfect Central Park Boathouse nuptials -- in Moms old wedding dress -- that Jane always longed for? Meanwhile Jane sets off a few damp sputtering sparks with Kevin who is planning to write a splashy Sunday feature on her existence as the ultimate bridesmaid. But she poor dear has no clue that hes even doing a story James Marsden so foppishly funny as the fairy-kingdom prince in Enchantedlathers on the charm here like too much aftershave. His Kevin is so gauntly male-modelish and smug hes like the screwball hero as gigolo. Its hard to imagine a set of complications more routine but the way that this tiered cake of a farce has been staged you can practically lick the white frosting off of the plot. Even the satire of the wedding industry plays like a backhanded endorsement of it. There is of course a trying-on-clothes montage though this one has a rare dash of wit Its Jane modeling all her bridesmaids dresses (which according to the film are meant to look bad so that they dont show up the bride) as the movie flashes back to the weddings in which she wore them. Theres also an intentionally cringe-worthy (though maybe not this much) duet between Jane and Kevin who take refuge at a bar following an auto mishap. Drunk on whiskey the two sing along with ""Bennie and the Jets"" getting down with their bad selves in their most impassioned white-person fervor which inspires the entire bar to join in. Love means never having to say youre sorry for acting like an idiot. Or for tying yourself in knots in order to tie the knot.

Frothy funny and formulaic ""27 Dresses"" is a pleasantly predictable romantic comedy that sees Katherine Heigl following ""Knocked Up"" with smooth moves at the wheel of her first starring vehicle. Set to open Jan. 11 pic could prove a potent draw for femme ticketbuyers dating couples and any ""Greys Anatomy"" fan who wants to see series regular Heigl in something other than a rerun. An engaging actress with a flair for physical comedy and self-effacing humor Heigl is immensely appealing as Jane Nichols an ever-helpful people-pleaser whose biopic could be titled ""The Runaround Bridesmaid."" Ever since her childhood when she started serving as surrogate mom to her younger sister following their mothers demise Jane has been a tireless provider of support and assistance for all in her orbit. Her chronic selflessness and attentiveness to detail have made her the perfect bridesmaid for her friends -- more than two dozen of them actually -- and an invaluable assistant for George (Edward Burns) a clothing and outdoor-equipment mogul whos blissfully oblivious to his employees infatuation. Janes avocation as a brides best friend attracts the attention of Kevin (James Marsden) a cynical reporter whos rather improbably employed (and even more improbably accomplished) as the author of a popular ""Weddings"" newspaper column. Unfortunately Kevin has something new to write about when Tess (Malin Akerman) Janes sexy self-absorbed sibling attracts the attention of George whos so smitten he proposes before really getting to know his intended. Guess whom Tess asks to be her bridesmaid? ""27 Dresses"" is a romantic comedy in which nothing the least bit surprising occurs no disagreement or estrangement seems sufficiently serious to persist and no one behaves in a manner that cannot be predicted by anyone who has seen more than two or three other romantic comedies. But it helps that scripter Aline Brosh McKenna (""The Devil Wears Prada"") has provided some very amusing wisecracks for co-star Judy Greer whose dry wit and spirited sauciness as Janes best buddy suggest a younger sexier Maggie Smith. It also helps that choreographer-turned-helmer Anne Fletcher (""Step Up"") often finds fresh approaches to handling familiar scenes When Jane and Kevin reach that inevitable point in their attracted-opposites relationship when theyre ready to unwind Fletcher puts them through amusing paces in a drunken sing-along scene that makes better use of Elton Johns ""Benny and the Jets"" than any pic since ""Aloha Bobby and Rose."" Whether shes neatly balancing hilarity and heartbreak while stifling her unrequited love for George or doing the bickering Beatrice-and-Benedict bit with a well-cast Marsden Heigl effortlessly radiates the kind of charisma that can make auds fall in love with a character (and of course the actress who plays her). Akerman Burns and Brian Kerwin (as the widowed father of Jane and Tess) are thoroughly pro but serve as little more than plot devices and/or window dressing. Costume designer Catherine Marie Thomas deserves special credit for creating the titular 27 bridesmaid dresses -- dutifully preserved in Janes cramped closet -- that range from gothic to cowgirlish from too revealingly slight to eye-stingingly garish. The outfits reinforce auds overall impression of Jane She must be a really really good friend if shes willing to wear outfits like these. 27 DressesProductionA 20th Century Fox release of a Fox 2000 Pictures and Spyglass Entertainment presentation of a Birnbaum/Barber production.
