Please let us know if you have any further problems. -Team RR Ajcsaid on Sunday September 21 2014 55717 AMI am an african american woman so i must totally disagree with the comment from the previous person. I am all for supporting black entertainers but truthfully the movie was not good at all. It was a far cry for help in comparison to the 1st. I am actually glad i got the rental for 1.27 and did not pay for it at the movies. Not everything is judged on race this is judged soley on the storyline. Not Surprised said on Saturday June 21 2014 12108 AMThis is the typical white establishment review of a majority black cast film call it lazy and cliched as if romantic comedies are typically brimming with originality and then slip up and admit the acting and comedy aspects were actually good. Blah blah blah.... we have heard this REVIEW a thousand times before. Reply from Richard Roeper Yes and Ive seen this movie a thousand times before. What I havent heard is such a ludicrous sweeping statement dismissing a review because it comes from they typical white establishment. You can do better than that.

(Matt Kennedy) C- Think Like a Man Too Genre Comedy; Starring Michael Ealy Meagan Good Regina Hall Kevin Hart; Director Steve Harvey Keith Merryman David A. Newman; Release Date Wide 06/20/2014; Runtime (in minutes) 106; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Sony Pictures Entertainment Posted July 6 2014 -- 1200 AM EDT Two years ago Think Like a Man succeeded because of the deliriously funny Kevin Hart and a flimsy but effective storytelling gimmick that used Steve Harveys best-selling relationship book to frame the war between the sexes. Five African-American or mixed-race couples ultimately found love after Harveys romantic playbook leveled the battlefield. Nevermind that the message of the movie seemed to be that men are dogs and the best way to bring them to heel is for women to act like their mothers. Think Like a Man Too catches up on the couples relationships as they all get together in Las Vegas for the wedding of their most schmoopy couple Candace (Regina Hall) and Michael (Terrence Jenkins) the idealistic fellow with the domineering mother from hell. Harveys book of wisdom is left at home this time. The guys re-enact The Hangover hijinks while the ladies enjoy shenanigans familiar to anyone who saw Bridesmaids (Even Wendi McClendon-Covey is along for the girls-night-out). Lacking any real game plan -- other than to test each relationship with commonplace conflicts related to parenting competing careers and commitment -- the film instead doubles-down on Hart a Tasmanian devil of a performer who can make almost anything funny. Hart an NBA basketball fan will understand when I compare his performance to Carmelo Anthony of the woeful New York Knicks. Hes so far superior to everything else in the movie that his ""teammates"" just stand around and watch him. Hart has to deliver a spectacular highlight every time he touches the ball for this movie to have any chance and as a result he takes some ill-advised shots. In several instances you can sense that director Tim Story simply rolled the proverbial ball out to Hart on the court and called the play Make it funny. Hart scores occasionally but Think Like a Man Too loses by double digits. C?

The 2012 romantic comedy Think Like a Man may have been based on a self-help book (Steve Harveys Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man) but it actually worked. Thanks partly to a talented and energetic cast and also to the fact that the book itself was used as little more than a story prop the film didnt try to make too many overarching points about men and women -- it was content to let us sit back and enjoy the battle of the sexes. Even less beholden to Harvey or his book this sequel brings back the same cast and creative team but its a lot messier and at least at first a lot less fun. This time we catch the characters as they arrive in Las Vegas for the wedding of mamas boy Michael (Terrence J) and independent-minded single-mom Candace (Regina Hall). Everybodys moving along on the path to stability. Onetime freak Zeke (Romany Malco) is now settled into a possibly headed-to-marriage relationship with Mya (the insanely beautiful Meagan Good). Talented chef Dom (Michael Ealy still a dreamboat) and corporate big shot Lauren (Taraji P. Henson) cant keep their hands off each other --A even though each is about to be confronted with work opportunities that may threaten their romance. Committed stoner Jeremy (Jerry Ferrara) and his taskmistress wife Kristen (Gabrielle Union) are trying to have a baby and so the pots off limits. Meanwhile through a rather hilarious misunderstanding seen in flashback diminutive busybody Cedric (Kevin Hart) has been chosen as the best man. And even though none of the men seems particularly keen on getting their freak on Ced is determined to show everybody a good time -- which of course means that everything will soon go to shit Hangover-style. The earlier film actually found an entertaining way to portray the challenges of maintaining lasting relationships between comically mismatched partners. This time these conflicts are used as little more than color as the film opts instead to try and give us a frantic exhausting journey through a night in Sin City. The guys and the gals go on their respective bachelor and bachelorette parties and a variety of by-the-book misunderstandings and confrontations ensue. Meanwhile some truly uninspired (but definitely shouty) narration from Hart tries to tie everything together occasionally peppering in lame attempts at comedy ""Damn That was like being blocked from behind by LeBron"" he yells in voice-over after Michaels mom interrupts the bride and the groom making out. ""Damn Rejected"" he yells after Mya chastises Zeke for his sordid past. (He says ""Damn"" a lot.) The film is at its best when it tosses away any and all interest in narrative clarity or continuity and just grooves on the energy of its likable attractive cast. At one point -- A no jokeA -- the movie basically becomes an extended music video for a cover of Bel Biv Devoes ""Poison"" featuring the female cast members complete with an identifying music video bug in the corner. Its utterly stupid and glorious. I also have to give props to a hilarious subplot featuring Dennis Haysbert playing Candaces smooth-talking Uncle Eddie. Think Like a Man Too is mostly uninspired and insipid but it rallies and builds up enough comic steam by the end that you might find yourself amused.

"Broken Hart The Witless Deeply Unnecessary Think Like a Man Too << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Broken Hart The Witless Deeply Unnecessary Think Like a Man Too Movies June 20 2014 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Once the women in Think Like a Man Too show up in their own music video for Bell Biv DeVoes ""Poison"" youre no longer watching a summer movie. Youre witnessing a sequence so incompetent that it must be avant-garde. Before they arrived at this nightclub they were just a fabulous bachelorette-party gang in an odorous sequel in which most of the scenes last less than a minute and Kevin Hart wont shut up. But then ""Poison"" comes on and the women already atop the bar at the Las Vegas nightplex get all ""That is my jam"" and can be heard singing over the track while the bumper-car camera work and Vitamix editing stumble into the vocabulary of a 112 video. Suddenly there are quick shots of Taraji P. Henson La La Anthony and Meagan Good writhing on furniture while Regina Hall and Wendi McLendon-Covey make faces into a fish-eye lens as they perform the rap interlude in which DeVoe confirms the skankiness of the ""low pro ho"" of the title (shes poison) with a little firsthand experience ""Me and the crew used to do her."" By this point most of these women have put one of Gabrielle Unions husbands pot strips on their tongues -- so its possible the subject of this pop classic has slipped their minds. Its also possible Im missing a brilliant point and theyre just obeying the titles instruction. When its over a music-video card pops onto the screen with a director credit Tim Steez. While the ladies party to ""Poison"" the movie keeps cutting to split-screen images of Hart trying to win money to pay for his 44000-a-night room. Its always one step forward and two back for me with him. In the winter he and Hall were sexy and funny together in About Last Night. Otherwise in the movies hes a gnat and the growth of his popularity means more time to buzz around your ears. (Really hes Joe Pesci with a flatter stomach.) Still the makers of this film appear to have hitched their wagon to Harts fame. He tried to steal the original movie but Henson beat him to it. This time around Henson might get 30 words total. The plot has Candace (Hall) and Michael (Terrence Jenkins) getting married in Vegas. Theyve invited their friends to join them. His haughty mother (Jenifer Lewis) tries to hijack both the wedding planning and the bachelorette party. Then Dennis Haysbert suavely swoops in and hijacks her. The dubious best-selling Steve Harvey self-help guide (Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man) that inspired the first movie gave it a rulebook structure. It was a big hit because it was a fun relationship comedy that was full of charismatic black actors being starry and glamorous. You could ignore Harveys chauvinistic certitude and you laughed and swooned at Hensons high-powered careerist. Two years later were still being fed ensemble movies with a dozen good actors that dont let them do enough. Sometimes it makes sense -- as it did with The Best Man Holiday. (Well the movie made sense not the title; who by the way is naming these sequels?) But here it feels like a pileup. Producer Will Packer has had a lot of commercial success -- Ride Along About Last Night and these Harvey movies are his. Harts become a star with him. Henson and Hall could too. In the meantime of the three movies hes backed so far this year Man Too somehow surpasses Ride Along as a piece of lazy lousy comedy. (Both are directed by Tim Story a.k.a. Tim Steez.) You feel bad arguing that something like 22 Jump Street suffers from an abundance of misapplied wit when a movie like Think Like a Man Too has none. But Packer doesnt appear to be that concerned with quality and judging from the grosses neither do we. In the long run quality matters of course. Yet no one who ends a movie with Hart fighting another character for money thats rained from an actual Steve Harvey slot machine cares about charges of literalism and redundancy -- only getting more.

"Think Like a Man Too (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Think Like a Man Too (PG-13) A battle of the sexes in Las Vegas. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle cogleMiamiHerald.com6/19/2014 Editor rating 2.5 The sequel to Think Like a Man is ostensibly a battle-of-the-sexes comedy about a group of friends who travel to Las Vegas for a wedding. But really its about Kevin Hart. The movie makes the expected token nods to the difficulties of coupledom -- how to reconcile a lovers checkered past how to know when youre ready to get married or have children how to cope with an intrusive parent how to weigh a big career decision against staying with your partner. But the undeniable star is the diminutive comedian. Hes the glue that holds the movie together when it wanders into the weeds and starts believing its a serious meditation on relationships. Freed from its ties to the source material -- the first film was inspired by a Steve Harvey self-help book -- Think Like a Man Too borrows liberally but in a definite PG-13 fashion from The Hangover hitting on every required Vegas touchstone (strippers boozing gambling wretched excess). Theres even a cameo by a boxer. Getting married are mamas boy Michael (Terrence Jenkins) and Candace (Regina Hall) despite the grim and disapproving presence of Michaels mother (Jenifer Lewis). There for the festivities are Jeremy (Jerry Ferrera) and Kristen (Gabrielle Union) who are already married and working on having a baby; former playboy Zeke (Romany Malco) and Mya (Meagan Good) who is less than thrilled with the number of people in Vegas who seem to know her boyfriend as ""Zeke the Freak""; dreamy chef Dominic (Michael Ealy) and businesswoman Lauren (Taraji P. Henson) still hot and heavy but about to face a couple of career challenges; and Bennett (Gary Owen) and Tish (Wendy McLendon Covey) the old married couple used as foils for white people/nerd jokes (he wants to play slots and see Jersey Boys; she wears twin sets and cant walk in heels). The best man of course is Cedric (Hart) whos on a break from his wife and determined to wreak as much havoc as possible. The plot such as there is revolves around a challenge Who will have a wilder better night in Vegas the men or the women? Its not much to hang a movie on but the hijinks are amusing and include an extremely funny video montage using the old Bel Biv Devoe classic Poison. Download it now if you dont have it because youre going to want it after you see the scene. Best of all theres Hart. Director Tim Story who also worked with the comedian in the less funny Ride Along trusts his star enough to give him free rein and Hart puts on a show preening shouting strutting threatening begging groveling showing off his best Risky Business moves (only this time to Pitbull not Bob Seger). If you think theres nothing funny left in this arsenal? Think again. Cast Kevin Hart Gabrielle Union Wendy McLendon Covey Jerry Ferrara Romany Malco Meagan Good Michael Ealy Taraji P. Henson Terrence Jenkins Regina Hall Adam Brody Gary Owen. Director Tim Story. Screenwriters Keith Merryman David A. Newman. Based on the book by Steve Harvey. A Screen Gems release. Running time 106 minutes. Crude sexual content including references partial nudity language and drug material. Opens Friday June 20 at area theaters.

Dads rote dismissal of the whole broad spectrum of Quebecois circus arts notwithstanding a sort of bored resignation to the swaying to-and-fro of some glitzed-up acrobat sums up the whole existential dead end of Las Vegas. Its a place where fortune fluctuates in accord with the capricious whims of providence where men (and yes sometimes women but usually men) are made or broken according to Lady Lucks fickle impulses. Its jerry-rigged to part you from your money as well as your good senses to make you buy into total garbage like ""fortune"" and ""providence"" and ""Lady Luck.""This built-in template of boom and bust (and boom again) make Vegas a natural staging ground for any movie. (The coursing rivers of bright lights and silicon dont hurt anything.) Vegas whole imagined mythos of fortune and fate undermined and then reasserted make it an ideal out-of-the-can storytelling scenario. At a loss for a better idea of where to dispatch your characters (or your franchise) for a sequel? Send em to Vegas. James Bond the Griswolds the Corleones whatever the familys name was from Honey I Blew Up The Kid ...Vegas will give em a narrative arc to pitch and yaw along for 90-plus minutes. Vegas baby. Vegas.So as if only to double down on the original films success Think Like A Man Too - the sequel to a movie based on a relationship book penned by current Family Feud host Steve Harvey - parachute drops its ensemble (including Jerry Ferrara Michael Ealy Gabrielle Union and Romany Malco) into Las Vegas for the wedding of mamas boy Michael (Terrence J) and single mom Candace (Regina Hall).Kevin Harts newly single Cedric shoulders best man duties taking the opportunity to overspend on a flashy suite at Caesars and obnoxiously micromanage the bachelor party debauchery (shots strippers yawn snooze). Meanwhile the ladies plan their own blowout bachelorette a bid at niftily capturing both the Hangover and Bridesmaids demographics. Hart recounts the proceedings in voiceover - mixing sports metaphors as he tallies ""points"" - resulting in a not altogether uncommon case of a movie suffering from way too much Kevin Hart.There are some okay jokes including a few digs at the buttoned-down white couple (Daddy Day Cares Gary Owen and Bridesmaids Wendi McLendon-Covey) and a cameo by a certain Canadian rap superstar whose very presence serves as its own punchline. But Think Like A Man Too does nothing to invigorate the sighing motions of the Vegas dramedy. Each couple comes with their own one problem inevitably solved by the predictable fireworks finale as if by the agency of the setting alone.Its intermittently fun and funny but after a while its just so much swinging back and forth. We get it. Youre up. Youre down. Youre back up again. Redemptive tourism-board subsidized Vegas movies like this play out like a ninth-grade English teacher charting the basic graph of rising and falling action drafted them on a blackboard.All you can really hope for is that the characters weather enough wide-eyed amusement and resolve enough personal drama that the Vegas arc can roll on undisturbed. Think Like A Man barely breaks even - entertaining enough to egg you into imprudently scanning for cheap WestJet packages to Sin City fun enough that the chimera of Vegas can shimmer on a sanctuary of self-indulgence and excess erected as a rampart fending off the sandy wash of a more consuming and ever-intruding nothingness.

And in some cases the whole Hollywood deal. ""Hes Just Not That Into You."" ""Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex."" ""What To Expect When Youre Expecting."" ""Sex and the Single Girl."" Not a plot among them but that didnt stop filmmakers from buying the titles -- and then coming up with their own stories. Because if you can get a hit film out of a song title some kiddie toys or the name of a Disneyland ride why not from a self-help book? The latest success story was Steve Harveys ""Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man"" a best-seller that purported to both reveal masculine secrets and give silly women a good talking-to. It became a 2012 ensemble comedy and now its back in a sequel. And basically its a little less annoying and a lot more of the same. The first film actually stuck a bit too close to the book both with its vaguely sexist advice (like Tyler Perry Harvey seemed to have a fear if not outright dislike of successful businesswomen) and its eagerness to squeeze a plug for its author into every scene. This movie manages to get away a bit from that by bringing the very large cast back together for a Las Vegas wedding - and bachelor and bachelorette parties which set out to compete in absolute decadence and end up matching each other in comic catastrophe. But while its nice to see some of Harveys paternalistic fingerwagging gone the movie has nothing to put in its place. The cast is back in force true but that may be part of the problem -- there are half-a-dozen couples here and when you add in new characters and supporting guest stars there are simply too many people for the filmmakers or us to keep track of. It becomes a blur. Kevin Hart -- who was the breakout delight of the previous film and last worked with Story on ""Ride Along"" -- really steals centerstage here and thats fine; hes got more energy than the next three actors put together. And Regina Hall (Harts partner in the ""About Last Night"" remake) and Taraji P. Henson are always welcome additions to any film and more than willing to go the extra comic mile. But the other actors get one-note characters to play -- the party animal the blue-eyed hunk the white dorks -- and never find any melody to add of their own. The movie is also a little too calculating in its attempts to appeal to Harveys broad traditional audience. On one hand that means finding a few funny cameos for hip-hop stars and berths for some veterans -- Jenifer Lewis George Wallace Dennis Haysbert. On the other it means being careful to hold onto that inoffensive PG-13 rating -- which for a lets-go-crazy Vegas comedy means strongly diluted decadence and strippers who wear more than the average boardwalk stroller at Point Pleasant. Hart works very hard to get laughs and gets quite a few sometimes on his own (he has a painfully deliberately unsexy ""Risky Business"" dance scene) and sometimes with the group (as when -- for reasons too complicated to go into -- he dresses up as Barney Rubble). But just as the Harvey book was something you took out of the library -- and returned well before its due date? This is the sort of film that only makes sense as a rental -- with perhaps a couple of friends and a very generously mixed pitcher of margaritas. Ratings note The film contains drug and alcohol abuse and sexual content. Think Like a Man Too (PG-13) Screen Gems (106 min.) Directed by Tim Story. With Kevin Hart Regina Hall Taraji P. Henson.

MATT KENNEDY BY MICHAEL SRAGOW / MOVIE CRITIC Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF Think Like a Man TooStarring Kevin Hart Michael Ealy Meagan Good Regina Hall Gabrielle Union Taraji P. Henson Terrence J Jenifer Lewis Romany Malco Directed by Tim Story Rated PG-13 for crude sexual content including references partial nudity language and drug material Running time 1 hour 46 minutes Playing In wide releaseThe quick hitA coed ""Hangover"" proves just as moldy as it sounds in this misbegotten sequel to the romcom hit. Grade D+ New rule Whatever movie films in Vegas stays in Vegas It would save us from monstrosities like ""The Hangover III"" and now ""Think Like a Man Too."" Its an exhaustingly farcical sequel to the earnest 2010 romcom based on Steve Harveys advice book ""Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man."" Hopes may rise among fans when the hugely overqualified cast gathers in Las Vegas for the wedding of the group mamas boy (Terrence J) and its exacting single mom (Regina Hall). Everyone continues to behave according to crowd-pleasing types. Aspiring chef Michael Ealy and media executive Taraji P. Henson try to sync their ambitions. The Harvey-quoting woman (Gabrielle Union) who was desperate to get her boy-man (Jerry Ferrara) to grow up now puts him on a strict lovemaking regimen to hasten the conception of a child. The movie swiftly devolves into a frantic contest over which group will behave more badly and bond more closely the night before the wedding - the guys reliving their party days or the hard-working gals letting their hair down. As if karaoke and strip-club scenes werent tired and obvious enough the returning filmmakers (director Tim Story screenwriters Keith Merryman and David A. Newman) burden the bride-to-be with the worst mother-in-law (Jenifer Lewis) since Jane Fonda in ""Monster-in-Law."" They also use one of many short-guy jokes to make Kevin Hart assume that hes Js pick for best man. He swiftly acquires a bank-breaking debt that drives him to the blackjack table. When it comes to wisdom about marriage - well as Henny Youngman might have said ""Take this movie. Please."" At the end Hart who also narrates ticks off lessons we should learn from the wedding weekend Sacrifice strengthens happy couples (Ealy Henson); relaxing expectations empowers everyone (Union Ferrara). By then its as if Hart is pasting shiny bumper stickers on a wheezing beat-up jalopy. Who thought Vegas would be a good place to follow up a relationship comedy anyway? In his book Harvey calls it the place men would go if the world had no real women. ""Theyve got everything we need in Vegas"" Harvey writes. ""You can gamble there smoke cigars eat steaks play golf and go to the strip club and really you wouldnt need that what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas slogan because men wouldnt go blabbing about what they did anyway."" Story lacks the choreographic skill for intricate comic set pieces and hes lost the soft touch with performers that made ""Barbershop"" so enjoyable. He pushes his frequent collaborator Hart into irritating tizzies. After one year of superstardom this motor mouth already needs a tuneup.

Credit Matt Kennedy/Sony Picture Classics Well you cant fault ""Think Like a Man Too"" for being a sequel too much like the original. The first film inspired by Steve Harveys how-to-get-your-guy best seller ""Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man"" was a blatant product promotion complete with bookstore signings and author appearances. Video Trailer Think Like a Man Too A preview of the film. By Screen Gems on Publish Date April 29 2014. Photo by Screen Gems. Watch in Times Video >> embed Two years later we find the couples from that story -- still personable attractive well dressed and mostly deserving -- arriving in Las Vegas for the wedding of Candace (Regina Hall) and Michael (Terrence J) which must be preceded by ill-advised behavior at bachelor and bachelorette parties. The crucial subplot belongs to the best man Cedric (Kevin Hart) who has splurged on an over-the-top 12000-square-foot suite for what he thinks is 4000 a night but turns out to be 40000. Things turn loud and desperate and stay that way and the moral seems to be Whatever you do dont act like a man because that means unjustified bravado whoop-it-up antics and adolescent humor.The one truly distinguished comic performance belongs to Dennis Haysbert as Uncle Eddie whose come-hither eyes and Al Green voice are intended to distract Loretta (Jenifer Lewis) Michaels priggish buzz-kill of a mother. Not that even a night of velvet-smooth seduction could improve this womans mood.""Think Like a Man Too"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

"Think Like a Man Too review Too little laughter | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThink Like a Man Too review Too little laughterExercising brain cells and going to Las Vegas tend to be mutually exclusive pursuits so it makes sense that the sequel Think Like a Man Too would flatline.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. June 19 2014Think Like a Man TooStarring Kevin Hart Terrence J Regina Hall Jenifer Lewis Michael Ealy Taraji P. Henson Romany Malco and Gabrielle Union. Directed by Tim Story. 105 minutes. Opens Friday at major theatres. PGExercising brain cells and going to Las Vegas tend to be mutually exclusive pursuits if movies like The Hangover and Last Vegas have taught us anything.So it makes sense that Think Like a Man Too would flatline as the Sin City sequel to the hit 2012 men vs. women rom-com. The original was based on Steve Harveys best-selling dating manual Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man and while it wasnt rocket science it encouraged some pondering about one how gender views the other.Article Continued BelowThe follow-up slams shut the book for the most part instead packing its likeable crew off to Vegas for some dumb and awfully predictable shenanigans.Kevin Hart centre as Cedric in the too-tame sequel Think Like A Man Too.  (Matt Kennedy / Sony Pictures)  The avowed reason for the road trip is the nuptials of confused mamas boy Michael (Terrence J) and sincere single mom Candace (Regina Hall) which of course ensures the attendance of Michaels meddling mother Loretta (Jenifer Lewis). The wedding guests reprise the couplings of the first film funky chef Dominic (Michael Ealy) and media exec Lauren (Taraji P. Henson); stoner Jeremy (Jerry Ferrara) and nest-builder Kristen (Gabrielle Union); dedicated playa Zeke (Romany Malco) and finger-wagging Mya (Meagan Good).One new pairing is Gary Owens doofus Bennett with Wendi McLendon-Coveys bookish Tish a vanilla couple who are about to be schooled as to why fanny packs and twin sets just dont cut it on Glitter Gulch. And naturally theres wild card Kevin Hart favourite collaborator of director Tim Story whose hotwired Cedric functions as narrator bumbling best man and catalyst for trouble. As far as Hart Story and returning screenwriters Keith Merryman and David A. Newman are concerned the wedding scenario is really just an excuse for boys and girls to go wild with respective bachelor and bachelorette parties.Yet its tamer than you would expect -- and hope. When Cedric discovers the palatial suite he booked at Caesars Palace is costing 40000 per night rather than 4000 his solution is for the lads to enter a Magic Mike-style male strippers contest. The result is not only G-rated but also Zzz-rated.Ditto for The Hangover steal where Kristen mistakenly distributes some of Jeremys well-disguised weed to the ladies. Do they end up with a trashed hotel room a roaming tiger and a chicken? Not really.For the most part Think Like a Man Too plays like a combination tourism video and Christian-themed message movie where the protagonists act vaguely naughty on the road to assured enlightenment and cuddling.Theres but one single line -- youll know it when you hear it -- that suggests any kind of thought went into writing the screenplay.And the only real visual flair is in a multiple split-screen scene in which the gals commandeer a nightclub and reimagine the video to Bell Biv DeVoes 1990 hit ""Poison."" Its better than the original and shows how smart this movie could have been.Dedicated fans of Hart and his crew might enjoy revisiting these characters who really deserve a better movie together.

"Review Think Like a Man Too is way too much of a good thing - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Think Like a Man Too is way too much of a good thing Think Like a Man Too Movie review by Betsy Sharkey Betsy Sharkey reviews Think Like a Man Too. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Betsy Sharkey reviews Think Like a Man Too. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Gambling strip clubs wedding in jeopardy jail bail. Yep Think Like a Man Too has it all. Yawn Comic Kevin Hart is always amped up. Its his style and in the last few years that style has earned him shooting-star status. In ""Think Like a Man Too"" Hart hits such adrenaline-fueled extremes its exhausting.Hart is on make that ON day and night as the sprawling group of friends we met in the 2012 adaptation of Steve Harveys bestselling ""Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man"" heads to Vegas for a wedding -- and the requisite debauched bachelor and bachelorette parties beforehand. As funny as Hart can be and there is no doubt he is funny ""Too"" is a case of too much Hart.All of the expected Vegas craziness is there too. The film works through every cliche on its way to the vows luxe hotel suites gambling strip clubs drinking more gambling wedding in jeopardy jail bail. But if you can look past the cliches and the comics high wattage and high-pitched screeching there are some interesting things going on in the sequel including its core message that love and marriage really do go together and its code of gender equality. Sometimes those commitment themes plays out in ridiculous ways -- the reflecting-on-life jail scenes do not rock -- but theres an underlying sweetness when the couples interact in more normal moments. If only the movie wrapped around those rare romantic interludes were better. Think Like A Man Too Matt Kennedy / SONY PICTURES Zeke (Romany Malco) and Mya (Meagan Good) star in ""Think Like A Man Too."" Zeke (Romany Malco) and Mya (Meagan Good) star in ""Think Like A Man Too."" (Matt Kennedy / SONY PICTURES) Tim Story is back in the directors chair. In fact between two ""Thinks"" and an upcoming sequel to his buddy-cop ""Ride Along"" featuring Hart and Ice Cube Story is almost exclusively in the Kevin Hart business these days. Keith Merryman and David A. Newman return as the writers. And there is that ginormous cast with a something-for-everyone collection of stereotypes all present and accounted for.Lets start with a roll call and rundown on where things stand. Mamas boy Michael (Terrence Jenkins) is marrying Candace (Regina Hall) the girl of his dreams he met in the first film. Mama Loretta (Jenifer Lewis) is as terrifying as ever. Lauren (Taraji P. Henson) and Dominic (Michael Ealy) are clearly the power couple. Career opportunities will be their crucible. Mya (Meagan Good) knew Zeke (Romany Malco) was a ladies man but his reputation in Vegas will put their bond to the test. Jeremy (Jerry Ferrara) and Kristen (Gabrielle Union) are in baby-making mode and they are beginning to have performance issues. As funny as Hart can be and there is no doubt he is funny ""Too"" is a case of too much Hart. -- Betsy Sharkey Cedric (Hart) is still the loose cannon of the bunch. Hes Michaels best man and on a 90-day-separation plan from his wife -- an explosive combination for someone who always has something to prove. Though Cedric is a force of nature Loretta the future mother-in-law from hell is too. Its a toss-up which one is wreaking the most havoc at least on paper. Loretta is resistant to loosening her grip on her son and in Lewis hands its an iron fist. Helping to loosen it is the arrival of Laurens Uncle Eddie (Dennis Haysbert). Haysbert who swoops in working his Teddy Pendergrass baritone is a welcome distraction.The look is more polished this time around the box-office success of the first no doubt padding the budget. Chris Duskin handles cinematography and Chris Cornwell production design. Veteran costume designer Salvador Perez Jr. deserves a special shout-out for Harts outrageous attire alone. Christopher Lennertz is in charge of the musical jam. Not surprisingly the soundtrack is hip-hop heavy with tracks from Pitbull M.C. Hammer and Mary J. Blige with a little throw-back Sinatra for good measure.Weirdly the womens lip sync of Bell Biv DeVoes ""Poison"" gets its own music video-esque treatment complete with directing credit also Story. If it were meant as a joke it falls flat. Mostly the movie swings wildly between mania when Hart is on-screen and relative serenity when hes not. It gives the film a multiple-personality feel that does not work in its favor.In addition to all the on-screen antics Cedric is the films narrator hand-holding us through the Vegas journey as if we couldnt figure out what was going on. The narration is also used to slip in some of the relationship advice that made Harveys book so winning. Harveys presence can be felt in other ways as well -- his face turns up on the slot machines along with the apples and pears.But this is the Kevin Hart show and its way ""Too"" much of a good thing.Twitter BetsySharkey Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Reviews Entertainment Column Think Like A Man Too Think Like a Man Too deepens the relationships Vegas-style Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-think-like-a-man-too-review-20140620-column.html,200,thinklikeamantoo11,thinklikeamantoo,latimes

Driven by an oppositional view of romance that proved outmoded and seldom funny Think Like a Man introduced us to six men living in Los Angeles and their corresponding flames. Some of these entanglements were new others ongoing; all of them apparently left the door open for a follow-up. Think Like a Man Too like many a sequel promises knee-slapping debauchery simply by virtue of taking place in Las Vegas. All together for the first time in months the boisterous gang and their better halves descend on the desert for their respective bachelor(ette) parties and a wedding. Would you believe me if I told you that nothing goes according to plan and theyre thrown through the movie-Vegas wringer? A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Kevin Hart whose star power has risen considerably since appearing in the first film as Cedric is given a more prominent role in this installment. He becomes Michaels (Terrence Jenkins) de facto best man after accepting an offer that was actually directed toward Dominic (Michael Ealy maybe the most purely charismatic performer in the whole franchise) whom he was standing directly in front of when the request was made. Of course the enthusiasm with which he takes on the responsibility is so great that Michael cant tell him the truth and Dom is too much of a mensch to make a big deal out of it.Cedric envisions Sin City as a boys-will-be-boys oasis of poolside cabanas and flowing alcohol. He endeavors to outdo all best men before him but his plans are for naught Massive debt that can only be regained via a heroic showing on the casino floor male strippers (is there anything funnier in a decisively hetero comedy?) a night in jail and obligatory celebrity cameo all await. Revealing that these scenarios give rise to an abundance of tired recycled jokes is as much of a spoiler as saying the upcoming exorcism movie will probably feature a lot of jump scares.Film Details Think Like A Man Too RatingPG-13 GenreComedy Running Time106 More Info Trailer Think Like a Man Too is as bland and anonymous in practice as it is on paper. Returning director Tim Story lays out the narrative wares with all the subtlety of a neon sign on the Strip not that the screenplay from Keith Merryman and David A. Newman (who also co-wrote the first one) gives him much to work with. Still some mercy has been shown Unlike its predecessor Too isnt directly based on a book of relationship advice by Steve Harvey. For one reason or another every character in the original based their approach to dating on the tome that gave the film its title the main effect of which was to make them temporarily miserable before they contrived to resolve their differences and live happily ever after.Branching out beyond Harveys book doesnt stop the filmmakers from framing the sequels simultaneous bachelor/bachelorette parties as a contest to see who can get the most outrageous (at least thats what were told theyre doing in narration by Harts character who uses basketball metaphors to describe every major event; the characters themselves dont actually seem to care about one-upping each other).To its credit little of the cruelty endemic to something like the Hangover movies is on display here and by and large these characters are well-intentioned people whose fraternal and romantic bonds are rooted in genuine care and affection. That doesnt make it any less disappointing that Taraji P. Henson is given about one-tenth as much to do as The Curious Case of Benjamin Button showed shes more than capable of however and Hart has yet to break the tradition of funny comedians making unfunny movies.

Photo Credit MCT / HANDOUT advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The cast of the 2012 comedy returns for a sequel set in Las Vegas. Rated PG-13 for language drug use and suggestive humor. BOTTOM LINE Noisy and clumsy compared to the sparkling original but the charming cast is a big plus. CAST Kevin Hart Taraji P. Henson Michael Ealy Wendi McLendon-Covey LENGTH 146 One of the nicest surprises of 2012 was ""Think Like a Man"" a romantic comedy inspired by Steve Harveys self-help book. It looked unpromising but turned out to be a winner thanks to its sparkling mixed-race cast and a deft sense of humor. The whole thing was a class act -- tasteful but not bland conservative but never square. The sequel ""Think Like a Man Too"" marks a dip in quality. Tim Story again directs from a screenplay by Keith Marryman and David A. Newman and the actors manage to provide a few winning moments. Overall though its everything the first movie wasnt noisy clumsy and derivative. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? The dating rules of Harveys book no longer apply since our lovers have all paired up but their story lines get rehashed anyway. Michael and Candace (Terrence J and Regina Hall) are determined to wed despite his domineering mother Loretta (Jenifer Lewis savoring every moment). Zeke and Mya (Romany Malco and Meagan Good) still have trust issues. Jeremy and Kristen (Jerry Ferrara and Gabrielle Union) are trying for a pregnancy. Dominic and Lauren (Michael Ealy and Taraji P. Henson both endlessly watchable) must juggle love and success. The kinetic Kevin Hart returns as Cedric the eternally single guy. See if this plot reminds you of another movie During a bachelor party in Las Vegas several guys get into trouble (and meet a famous boxer) and risk missing the wedding. Before you say ""The Hangover"" consider that the women are also behaving badly a la ""Bridesmaids"" (whose star Wendi McLendon-Covey is newly cast as the nerdy wife of Bennett played by Gary Owen). Theres also a male strip club straight out of ""Magic Mike."" Drugs are ingested and mug shots are taken; Adam Brody and David Walton join the entourage but do almost nothing; the singer Drake makes a cameo. ""Think Like a Man Too"" feels jumbled and random more miss than hit. In Hollywood as in Las Vegas you cant win em all. 240 MoviesThink Like A Man Too trailer PLOT The cast of the 2012 comedy returns for a sequel set in Las Vegas.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Think Like a Man Too"" makes a modest promise and over-delivers on it. For the cost of your ticket you get almost two hours of quick-paced mind-numbing silliness. Its amateurish but gleeful. The zoom-zoom pacing and all-in performances make sure the jokes dont fall on dead air. Theres hardly any plot and a commonplace premise. Five couples visit Sin City for a wedding and the bachelor/bachelorette parties go out of bounds. As comedy of misbehavior goes its sweet-spirited without the stifled rage that fueled the identically themed ""Hangover"" movies. Like its predecessor this comedy was designed with inclusion in mind. Its cast is half women and half men predominantly black but with significant supporting roles for the white players. The jokes are stereotypical with the black players on the cool crazy or soulful side and whites mild and nerdy but theres no venom in the laughs. Everyones endearing. Tiny tornado Kevin Hart as the rip-it-up party animal best man gripes that the rest of the men dont want to go crazy; he calls them his ""nontourage."" His opposite number is Wendi McLendon-Covey as a sweetly frumpy bridesmaid whose idea of Vegas glam is a sea-foam twin set. Shes very funny in a recessive all-by-herself way. When she comes alive with Gabrielle Union Meagan Good and the rest of the girls in the inevitable rap singalong its like watching a beige Ford Taurus turn into the Batmobile. As the dragon lady mother of the groom formidable Jenifer Lewis is an imperious spoilsport undermining her soon-to-be daughter-in-law at every turn. Shes blazingly alive and hard a witch who could give Maleficent some lessons on indestructibility. Director Tim Story whips the movie along. He gets laughs out of zany costumes (a strip-show amateur night gives Hart an excuse to dress like the Flintstones Bam-Bam) and random celebrity cameos (Drake Floyd Mayweather and as a mens club dancer the bodacious Coco). THINK LIKE A MAN TOO  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for crude sexual content including references partial nudity language and drug material. The story is nothing more than a jungle gym for the cast to play on but Story keeps the pace so frantic and the soundtrack so stuffed with delights we scarcely have time to notice. If only every trivial movie were this much fun. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

This time they rendezvous in Las Vegas for the wedding of Candace (Regina Hall) and Michael (Terrence Jenkins).In a prolonged flashback Cedric (Kevin Hart) assumes the mantle of best man. Once in Vegas he books a palatial suite complete with his own British-accented butler.Also returning are Dominic (Michael Ealy) and Lauren (Taraji P. Henson) whose new job opportunities threaten to derail their relationship; Zeke (Romany Malco) and Mya (Meagan Good) whose romance may be taking a serious next step; Jeremy (Jerry Ferrara) and Kristen (Gabrielle Union) who are trying to have a baby; and Bennett (Gary Owen) and Tish (Wendi McLendon-Covey) on a break from parenting duties.REVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYMORE USA TODAYs guide to summer moviesOn hand to be an obnoxious killjoy is Michaels overbearing mother Loretta (Jenifer Lewis) who dislikes her prospective daughter-in-law for no discernible reason. Newcomer Dennis Haysbert plays Uncle Eddie who shows up in the nick of time for all concerned.The first film was loosely based on the Steve Harvey book Act Like a Lady Think Like a Manwhich aimed to empower women providing insight into the workings of male minds. The sequel makes no pretense of such perspective.This time its men vs. women in a puerile contest of pre-wedding debauchery. The film comes off like a PG-13-rated Hangover with moments recalling Bridesmaids and What Happens in Vegas.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare The cast of Think Like a Man are reunited for a sequel. The couples vacation to Las Vegas for a wedding but the bachelor and bachelorette parties begin to compete with eachother. VPCHart is irritatingly shrill the guys dress up ridiculously for a male stripper contest both genders do the age-old slow-mo walk from Reservoir Dogs and a brawl erupts involving nearly all the players.The only faintly fresh scenes involve music video moments where Hart dances in his underwear a la Tom Cruise in Risky Business and the girls belt out Bell Biv DeVoes Poison. Most of the film however comes across as a tiresome blend of stale and frantic.Harts career has skyrocketed since the first movie so this is less an ensemble comedy than ""The Kevin Hart Show. At one point Dominic admonishes Harts character with ""This is not about you"" but director Tim Story seems to be saying otherwise.The films editing is frenetic and only serves to amplify Harts already high-energy loudmouth antics. Ordinarily hilarious hes been better in nearly every other movie hes made. He was funnier as himself on The Tonight Show this week miming terror as he rode a roller-coaster with host Jimmy Fallon. Introducing a clip from the movie Hart prefaced it with ""I apologize for what youre about to see ahead of time.""Wisely said.What happened in Vegas offers no insight whatsoever into the battle of the sexes. A comedy meant to offer wisdom about gender politics instead its as if it opened its mouth to say something clever and nothing came out. Or perhaps the humor just stayed in Vegas. 68 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 10 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1ioZ3h9",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/06/19/think-like-a-man-too-review/9684383/,200,thinklikeamantoo16,thinklikeamantoo,usatoday

Youd never know that from ""Think Like a Man Too"" which opens by describing Sin City as ""Disneyland for adults"" before devoting most of its running time to loving shots of blackjack tables at Planet Hollywood glitzy villas and cabanas at Caesars (the 40000-a-night ""Constantine Suite"" alone gets name-checked about two dozen times) and the fountains at the Bellagio. See video Kevin Hart Leads Battle of the Sexes Through Las Vegas in Think Like a Man Too Trailer (Video) I mention all this pro-Vegas propaganda because this sequel to the amusing 2012 sleeper hit spends so much time trying to sell audiences on a vacation to Nevada that it can barely devote any attention to its dozen or so major characters -- all of whom have descended on the resort town for the marriage of Candace (Regina Hall) and Michael (Terrence Jenkins). Unlike ""How to Train Your Dragon 2"" which gives us characters older wiser and more experienced than they were in the previous movie ""Too"" pretty much reprises all the conflicts from last time Candace still thinks Michael is too attached to his mommy Miss Loretta (the great Jenifer Lewis); Mya (Meagan Good) hasnt gotten over the playboy past of Zeke (Romany Malco); conflicting career issues continue to vex the relationship between high-powered exec Lauren (Taraji P. Henson) and chef Dominic (Michael Ealy); and now that Kristen (Gabrielle Union) has tamed man-child Jeremy (Jerry Ferrara) into marriage she wants a baby. And then theres Cedric (Kevin Hart) once again separated from his wife Gail (Wendy Williams) who has taken his title of best man (which he unwittingly intercepted from Dominic) way too seriously -- organizing the bachelor party to end all bachelor parties in the aforementioned Constantine Villa. (Hart also narrates in a relentlessly screechy voice that suggests that director Tim Story recorded the comedian backstage at a loud concert where he was struggling to be heard.) Also read Jamie Foxx Kevin Hart in Talks to Star in Hitman Movie The Black Phantom As with the first movie the conflicts (as created by returning screenwriters Keith Merryman and David A. Newman) arent nearly as interesting as the actors who are all working overtime to elevate the material. (Well except for Terrence Jenkins; the E host is clearly out of his depth here.) The good news is that Steve Harveys dating manual ""Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man"" is no longer being cited every five minutes; the bad news is that the ensemble barely has time to do or say anything amidst all the Las Vegas Glitz Since the principals are stuck with all the tedious plotting and exposition it gives ample opportunities for the second bananas to steal scene after scene whether its Wendi McClendon-Covey as a buttoned-up housewife who gets a hot-tomato makeover or Dennis Haysbert as Candaces Uncle Eddie who provides a suave distraction for Miss Loretta complete with hilarious slow-jam accompaniment (from scorer Christopher Lennertz). Also read Taraji P. Henson to Star in Lee Daniels Fox Hip-Hop Drama Empire And in a stroke of fortuitous timing theres a funny running gag about going to see ""Jersey Boys"" all the more fitting since Clint Eastwoods big-screen adaptation of the hit musical is this movies main opening-weekend competition. There are moments of fun to be found in ""Think Like a Man Too"" particularly a bachelorette party lip-sync that will be feebly imitated by drunk girls for years to come. Its just a pity that the movie does better by members of the Las Vegas Convention amp; Visitors Authority than those of the Screen Actors Guild. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

The outrageous comedy also stars (from l.) Sonia (La La Anthony) Mya (Meagan Good) Lauren (Taraji P. Henson) Kristen (Gabrielle Union) and Tish (Wendi McLendon-Covey). (Matt Kennedy) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday June 19 2014 1201 PM Title Think Like a Man Too Film Info Friends gather for a wedding in Las Vegas. Director Tim Story (145) PG-13 Raunchy humor language. Area theaters. A gathering of a large group of friends can be energetically fun or crazy loud. ""Think Like a Man Too"" is thankfully more the first of those though its not afraid to be the second one either. Both options are embodied in the movies lively unofficial master of ceremonies Kevin Hart. The diminutive motormouthed comic makes sure this rom-comedy sequel never lags. The movie is based on Steve Harveys self-help book just like the original ""Think Like a Man"" movie back in 2012. In ""Too"" Cedric (Hart) and his pals all in various stages of coupledom gather in Vegas for a wedding. Some of the guys are aiming to ""make bad decisions theyll regret the next day.""Most of the women are aiming to do the same thing. Staying in the same hotel are the soon-to-be bride and groom Michael (Terrence Jenkins) and Candace (Regina Hall). Cedric is best man a responsibility meant to go to Dominic (Michael Ealy) who is having work-related conflicts with his love Lauren (Taraji P. Henson). Both Dominic and Lauren are weighing job offers. Lauren (Taraji P. Henson) in Screen Gems THINK LIKE A MAN TOO. (Matt Kennedy) Dominic (Michael Ealy) in Screen Gems THINK LIKE A MAN TOO. (Matt Kennedy) Taraji P. Henson and Michael Ealy stars of ""Think Like a Man Too."" Then theres Jeremy (Jerry Ferrara of ""Entourage"") and Kristen (Gabrielle Union) hoping to make it over the baby-conception hurdle. Meanwhile Zeke (Romany Malco) and Mya (Meagan Good) have to get over Zekes famous bachelor past reminders of which keep popping up. And bland Bennett and Tish (Gary Owen and Wendi McLendon-Covey) try to get in the groove in their married-with-kids way. Finally theres the grooms overbearing mother Loretta (Jenifer Lewis). Her disapproving glances melt away when she meets one of the gangs gentlemanly uncle (a great Dennis Haysbert). Hes flown in special to soothe the savage mom-in-law. Nothing can calm Cedric however as his best-man plans hit comical missteps. Director Tim Story (""Barbershop"" ""Ride Along"") keeps the movie running as smoothly as he did the first time round. Thats not so easy with a cast this big and so many plotlines. But the actors make the raucousness feel as easy as the cinematic couples therapy. The girls hit the Hustler Club in Vegas. (Matt Kennedy) Its a girls night out and then some in ""Think Like a Man Too."" (Matt Kennedy) The guys of ""Think Like a Man Too."" (Matt Kennedy) The standouts are Ealy graciously dialing down his leading-man charisma to be a team player and Union sexy and sweet as ever. The cast members give it their all though Hall is forced to tone down the volcanically crazy energy she let loose in ""About Last Night."" As for Hart he could make a funeral fun. This whirling dervish is hilariously almost headache-inducingly silly. ""Think Like a Man Too"" consistently lands on the right side of the comedy aisle despite more than a few cliches -- we never need to see a shot of pals walking in slow-motion to thumping music ever again. The movie also heads toward unexpected places as when the guys and girls arrive separately at a ladies male strip club where a cash-poor Cedric talks his friends into dancing to win a cash prize. The night culminates in a free-for-all fight not a sexy dance. Because when you have this many talented folks assembled you dont have to go for the easy shot.

TWITTER Kevin Hart and the entire gang return for this sequel to the surprise hit based on comedian Steve Harveys best-selling relationship advice book. Think Like a Man based on Steve Harveys best-selling comic relationship advice tome Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man was a box-office hit two years ago so its not surprising that its been accorded a sequel. Featuring the entire original ensemble including Kevin Hart as well as several new additions to the cast Think Like a Man Too is a frantic overstuffed follow-up that with its Las Vegas setting more closely resembles a Hangover sequel than its relatively restrained predecessor. While the film seems poised for major box-office success it mainly squanders the talents of its talented cast and is bound to test the patience of more discriminating audiences. PHOTOS  Hollywoods Notable Deaths of 2014 All of the first films four couples are back with each facing relationship issues. Mamas boy Michael (Terrence J) and single mother Candace (Regina Hall) are about to get married much to the consternation of his overbearing mother Loretta (Jenifer Lewis). Newlyweds Jeremy (Jerry Ferrara) and Kristen (Gabrielle Union) are at odds over her desperate desire to get pregnant. Laurens (Taraji P. Henson) and Dominics (Michael Ealy) relationship is threatened when she receives a lucrative job offer that entails moving to New York. And Mya (Meagan Good) is unable to get over her discomfort with Zekes (Romany Malco) reputation as a player especially when hes greeted in his old stomping grounds as ""Zeke the Freak."" Also on hand are the groups dorky friend Bennett (Gary Owen) and his fashion-challenged wife Tish (the reliably amusing Wendi Mclendon-Covey); Myas best friend Sonia (La La Anthony); and Michaels former fraternity brothers Isaac (Adam Brody) and Terrell (David Walton). PHOTOS 19 Sequels That Outgrossed the Original Movies And of course theres Cedric (Hart) the height-impaired lothario -- now on a trial separation from his shrewish wife Gail (Wendy Williams) -- who mistakenly assumes the role of Michaels best man for the wedding and impulsively books a lavish hotel suite complete with a private British butler that he thinks is 4000 a night but actually costs 10 times that. If that description seems overwhelming the film which juggles so many characters and situations that its exhausting simply trying to keep up is no less so. Director Tim Story and screenwriters Keith Merryman and David A. Newman seem mainly intent on exploiting the Vegas setting to the nth degree with the proceedings practically coming across as a paid advertisement for Caesars Palace. Hart is clearly the dominant presence with his motormouthed line delivery and manic physicality but while he scores plenty of laughs hes also forced to perform such embarrassing scenes as a Risky Business parody in which he frenziedly dances around his hotel suite in his underwear. The rest of the action is divided between so many characters that few of the performers manage to make much of an impression with the exception of Lewis as the domineering mother who enjoys a one-night stand with the suave smooth talking ""Uncle Eddie"" (Dennis Haysbert). PHOTOS 10 Highest Grossing Movie Sequels Making a token nod to its literary inspiration with relationship-oriented narration by Hart that barely makes an impression the film relies on such cliched plot elements as the men reluctantly joining an amateur male stripper contest in an attempt to make enough money to pay for the hotel suite -- much to the surprise of their women who have ventured to the club for a bachelorette party. Theres also the requisite comic shopping montage and a faux music video in which the distaff castmembers lip-sync to Bell Biv DeVoes 1990 hit ""Poison."" The expected celebrity cameos include Drake and boxer Floyd Mayweather with the latter making Mike Tyson seem a comic genius by comparison. Kelsey Grammer also shows up for a couple of scenes to little effect. Coming across as more than a little desperate in its unrelenting freneticism Think Like a Man Too possesses none of the charm of its predecessor. By the time the seemingly endless film reaches its conclusion youll wish that what happened in Vegas had stayed in Vegas.

""Think Like a Man Too"" ""Think Like a Man Too"" Matt Kennedy ""Think Like a Man Too"" ""Think Like a Man Too"" ""Think Like a Man Too"" Kevin Harts rush on the nations box office continues with ""Think Like a Man Too.""Its the sequel to the 2012 romantic comedy ""Think Like a Man"" which initially put the ""Ride Along"" and ""About Last Night"" star on top of the comedy heap.The film keeps many of the same parts of the first ones winning formula beginning with Hart himself. Harts persona is manic fast-talking and somewhat self-deprecating.Hes surrounded by an attractive earnest and diverse cast that suits the story. Moving all the action to Las Vegas turns everything up a few notches.Every character from the original is here navigating the dating jungle but this time theres no pushing of Steve Harveys book ""Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man"" which dogged the first movie. (Still present is Harts annoying voiceover.)Fueling the action this time are the Vegas-set nuptials of Candace and Michael (Regina Hall and Terrence Jenkins). Loretta (Jenifer Lewis) is Michaels meddling hatin mama. The couple represent the films heart something that was missing before. Helping them celebrate are Cedric (Hart with his movie wife Wendy Williams putting in another cameo) Zeke and Mya (Romany Malco and Meagan Good) Dominic and Lauren (Michael Ealy and Taraji P. Henson) Bennett and Tish (Gary Owen and Wendy McLendon-Covey) and Jeremy and Kristen (Jerry Ferrara and Gabrielle Union) all navigating their various romantic issues. The many subplots are not very involved or compelling and leave plenty of room for Hart to run amok with his antics especially when Cedric realizes that the luxury Vegas suite he has booked costs substantially more than what he thought.Such a sitcom-friendly development can lead to only one thing in a movie like this. All the men must compete in an amateur male strip competition and win the cash to pay for Cedrics room.High jinks ensue clearly in this routine which fares better than the time when those ""Hangover"" dudes hit the Vegas strip.What ""Think Like a Man Too""  Two and a half stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 146  Content Crude sexual content including references partial nudity language and drug material Kevin C.

The influence of ""The Hangover"" looms like a toxic cloud over ""Think Like a Man Too"" a raucous mess of a Vegas-set sequel that brings new meaning to the term ""sloppy seconds."" Although funnier and mercifully shorter than its 2012 battle-of-the-sexes predecessor this third collaboration between manic comedian Kevin Hart and director Tim Story (hot on the heels of their January hit ""Ride Along"") is an exceedingly formulaic and ultimately exhausting thing to experience; with its mash-up of Sin City shenanigans and be-good-to-your-woman relationship advice watching it is like attending a self-help seminar where the keynote speaker keeps trying to give you a lap dance. Still thats not a recipe likely to turn off target audiences for this Screen Gems release which is on track to land in the vicinity of the first pics 91 million domestic haul. Charting the romantic misadventures of four men and four women bent on wooing and outsmarting each other using the sexist stratagems laid out in Steve Harveys bestseller ""Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man"" the first film was effectively a feature-length advertisement for its source material barely rescued from total banality by its attractive and appealingly grounded cast. As written by returning scribes Keith Merryman and David A. Newman ""Think Like a Man Too"" represents something of an improvement insofar as it has the good sense to largely ditch the book and keep the actors while building loosely on the characters relational conflicts regarding sex work family and commitment. The wedding of straightlaced mamas boy Michael (Terrence J) and good-hearted single mom Candace (Regina Hall) is the occasion that brings this group of friends from Los Angeles to Las Vegas where Mya (Meagan Good) is miffed to discover that her b.f. Zeke (Romany Malco) seems to have slept with every woman on the Strip. Also along for the festivities are the slackerish Jeremy (Jerry Ferrara) and the driven Kristen (Gabrielle Union) whose determination to get pregnant is starting to tax Jeremys sexual stamina; plus rising chef Dominic (Michael Ealy) and high-powered media executive Lauren (Taraji P. Henson) who once more find themselves struggling to reconcile their unique vocational paths. Theoretically any of these couples could have been the one to tie the knot although the present arrangement makes dramatic sense since it ensures the unwelcome involvement of Michaels mother Loretta (Jenifer Lewis). Even more of a raging Freudian nightmare here than she was in the original Loretta quickly hijacks the wedding plans and does her utmost to ensure that nothing untoward (or fun for that matter) takes place at either her sons bachelor party or her future daughter-in-laws bachelorette party both of which are conveniently scheduled for the night before the wedding. Of course with the best-man duties falling to that rambunctious idiot-clown Cedric (Hart) and with Candace and her bridesmaids inadvertently getting high on marijuana-laced chewing gum a tame and tasteful evening is not exactly in the cards. While the two gender factions will eventually collide (in a scene that suggests ""Magic Mike"" by way of an MMA cage match) the men and women are effectively isolated from each other for the better part of the movie a decision that makes the climactic 20-minute stretch of teary-eyed reconciliations feel even more tedious robotic and downright head-scratching than expected. Until that point ""Think Like a Man Too"" does put on a lively and intermittently guffaw-worthy show despite its gutless PG-13 rating and the simple fact that what happens in Vegas is more or less what always happens in Vegas. Unleashing their characters against a titillating backdrop of strip clubs and swimming pools Merryman and Newman have at least written a few sharper more consistent zingers this time out and Storys otherwise bland direction does at times rise to the manic occasion peaking with an energetic split-screen-heavy sequence in which the two booze-fueled parties turn Bell Biv DeVoes ""Poison"" into their own surreally debauched musicvideo. Setting an over-caffeinated rhythm for the farcical proceedings as ever is Hart. From the first shimmering glimpse of the Strip the comic and his high-pitched mile-a-minute vocal delivery are stamped all over every frame whether hes narrating the story in mostly unnecessary voiceover or dancing ""Risky Business""-style (plus argyle socks) in a 40000-a-night Caesars Palace suite. Roughly one part endearing to four parts headache-inducing Harts presence is thankfully counterbalanced by an otherwise agreeably mellow ensemble of actors who are never less than charismatic and gorgeous to look at even when theyre being put through their utterly predictable paces. As in the first film Ealy and Henson stand out as a pair who clearly deserve a full-length romantic comedy of their own rather than being crammed into the same movie with three others. There are welcome cast reinforcements in the form of Dennis Haysbert as Candaces Uncle Eddie an assignment he seems to have treated charmingly as an unusually amorous Allstate commercial; and Wendi McLendon-Covey (""Bridesmaids"" TVs ""Rules of Engagement"") socking over her role as the drab white girl who lets her hair down enough to become an honorary member of the sisterhood. Less successfully deployed are Adam Brody and NBC sitcom star David Walton as Michaels fraternity brothers wittily dismissed onscreen as alumni of ""Abercrombie amp; Fitch Epsilon."" Other entertainment personalities making drive-by cameos here include boxer Floyd Mayweather dancer and reality TV star Coco and rapper Drake while talkshow host Wendy Williams reprises her role as Cedrics perpetually on-again off-again spouse. The juxtaposition of Harts vocal antics and a soundtrack overloaded with pop/Ramp;B/hip-hop tunes make for a nonstop cacophonous experience unfortunately abetted by the very crummy echo-prone sound projection at the press screening attended.

Henson) Candace (Regina Hall) Kristen (Gabrielle Union) and on the front row Mya (Meagan Good) and Tish (Wendi McLendon-Covey) have some much-needed down time in ""Think Like a Man Too."" (Matt Kennedy) By Ann Hornaday June 19 2014 Follow AnnHornaday And I told myself I wouldnt laugh. ""Think Like a Man Too"" the derivative intermittently amusing follow-up to the surprise hit rom-com from 2012 is so frenetically paced and hysterically pitched that it makes almost no room for simple enjoyment. Propelled by a screaming voice-over performance from Kevin Hart and director Tim Storys hyper-emphatic approach to everything from line readings to editing and music this ensemble enterprise -- about four couples experiencing the ups and downs of girl-guy relationships -- comes at the audience like a fire hose assaulting them with endless chatter and parallel action until we just want to beg everyone involved simply to slow down and let themselves breathe. ""Just stop"" one character tells Cedric the obnoxious motormouth played by Hart. And we know how that person feels Hart a practitioner of the love-him-or-shrug brand of stand-up comedy becomes such a grating presence that its a relief when ""Think Like a Man Too"" allows him brief respites offstage. But then out of nowhere he pops up with a piece of physical comedy too hilarious to be denied -- specifically a sight gag involving a bar brawl a mug shot and a sexy Bam-Bam costume that must be seen to be fully appreciated. Such are the uneven but distinctive pleasures of ""Think Like a Man Too"" which finds the original films accomplished spectacularly attractive cast still young and gorgeous two years down the road. Dominic and Lauren (Michael Ealy Taraji P. Henson) are happily ensconced as a couple their class differences settled for the moment; college sweethearts Jeremy and Kristen (Jerry Ferrara Gabrielle Union) are trying for a baby at least in between Jeremys bong hits; Zeke and Mya (Romany Malco Meagan Good) are still together despite Zekes checkered past as a quintessential player; and Michael and Candace (Terrence Jenkins Regina Hall) are getting married -- in Las Vegas where the whole crew has gathered for the ceremony and night-before festivities. (In case viewers were hoping for fresh original writing Hart disabuses that optimism within the first few seconds of ""Think Like a Man Too"" during which he invokes the ""Disneyland for adults"" and ""what stays in Vegas"" cliches in rapid-fire succession.) That eventful evening forms the antic frantic backdrop for ""Think Like a Man Too"" which is structured around dueling bachelor/hen parties. In the guys case this means tequila shots strip clubs and a raging after-party; as for the laydeez its all tea cakes and pedicures until one of them commandeers the boys limo and the sisters give the dudes a raunchy run for their money. Like the first film -- based on Steve Harveys self-help book ""Act Like a Lady But Think Like a Man"" -- this installment falls prey to all manner of gender stereotypes. The men are either commitment-phobic or see marriage fatherhood and domestication as toxic threats to their masculinity; the women are the buzz-kills either barking out orders on when to have sex for maximum fertilization or comparing and complaining about sexual pasts. Those war-of-the-sexes tropes are tiresome for sure as are the obvious lifts from such predecessors as ""The Hangover"" ""Bridesmaids"" and ""Magic Mike."" But thats not to say that ""Think Like a Man Too"" doesnt occasionally generate its own laughs especially during a hard-partying sequence that devolves into an improvised Bell Biv DeVoe video. One of the steadiest sources of humor is Gary Owen who with Wendi McLendon-Covey plays a couple tagging along for the ride and who delivers some funny wholesome-minded zingers culminating in a Ray Lewis-inspired aria delivered by way of a jail-cell phone. A couple of big-name cameos notwithstanding theres nothing surprising about ""Think Like a Man Too"" but that predictability may well ensure its success with the audience that made the original such a huge hit. Despite Storys desperate attempts to cover a superficial plot and weak writing with a jacked-up vibe and sheer volume the movie still ultimately lands like a thinly veiled lecture with Hart helpfully delivering the moral upshot -- about compromise sacrifice and letting go of the past -- just in case someone in the audience accidentally ingested one of Jeremys THC-infused breath strips.

"Think Like a Man Too movie review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review Think Like a Man Too  Video Think Like a Man Too features strong cast in routine comedy Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips reviews the follow up to the 2012 hit and reveals a star-studded cast on a not-so-original trip to Vegas. Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips reviews the follow up to the 2012 hit and reveals a star-studded cast on a not-so-original trip to Vegas. Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune A 105-minute ad for Caesars Palace the passably engaging sequel ""Think Like a Man Too"" allows Kevin Hart the ensembles hottest potato to hijack whole sections of the Las Vegas-set hijinks as he lets loose with his little verbal tsunamis of braggadocio. The way this comedy has been edited by Peter S. Elliot presumably at the urging of director Tim Story the shots barely hold themselves for two or three seconds before slam-cutting away to a pushy reaction shot. This isnt momentum; its agitation and antsy pacing such as this has a way of giving the impression of energy rather than truly energizing a scene.The first film wasnt like this not to this degree. Based on Steve Harveys relationship advice book the 2012 hit breezed by on the strengths of its prodigiously charming cast so that whatever Harvey and the script were actually advising -- Women lock it up Dont be skanks -- you could ignore it and concentrate on the back-and-forth and the byplay. The sequel is a disappointing step down and backward. The gang reunites in Vegas for the meticulously planned wedding of Candace (Regina Hall) and Michael (Terrence Jenkins). Michaels steely meddling force-of-Christianity mother (Jenifer Lewis) gets sidetracked by a suave wedding guest played by Dennis Haysbert; high-flying corporate leader Lauren (Taraji Henson) and her laid-back chef boyfriend Dominic (Michael Ealy) are tempted by job offers that will wreak havoc on their togetherness; ""Zeke the Freak"" (Romany Malco) and wised-up Mya (Meagan Good) cope with Zeke running into a variety of previous hookups.Once separated the bachelor and bachelorette parties get into the usual Vegas trouble culminating at a male strip club where the ladies are there for one reason and the men are there wearing not much trying to win back money needed by Cedric (Hart) to pay for his 40000-a-night Caesars suite. Surprises in ""Think Too"" are few though some bits -- the best being a music video riff on the 90s dance tune ""Poison"" by Bell Biv DeVoe -- make up for the grinding familiarity of Harts voice-over narration ""What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas."" Really? We needed to be reminded of that one? The funniest scene is familiar but it works a series of mug shots after the strip club melee lands everybody in jail the morning of the wedding. If you really want to compare apples and oranges I suppose Id recommend ""Think Too"" over a few other Vegas-debauchery-with-consequences comedies. The women have more to do this second time around which is good; the material itself could and should be better.mjphillipstribune.com""Think Like a Man Too"" - 2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for crude sexual content including references partial nudity language and drug material)Running time 145Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Movies Reviews Bars and Clubs Weddings Steve Harvey Romany Malco Tim Story Latest movie reviews Review Jersey Boys  1/2 Review A Coffee in Berlin  Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising77deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-think-like-a-man-too-20140619,0,2714644.column",200,thinklikeamantoo23,thinklikeamantoo,chicagotribune

Share Tweet Think Like A Man Too the Vegas-set follow-up to 2012s Think Like A Man ditches the bizarre cult-of-personality trappings of the original leaving only the blandest of ensemble relationship comedies. Gone are the talk-show interludes with Dear Leader Steve Harvey. Absent are any scenes of characters reading and discussing his magnum opus Act Like A Lady Think Like A Man in order to learn the Juche ideal of modern relationships. (There is however a scene where a character wins 100000 on a Steve-Harvey-branded slot machine.) Think Like A Man was a memorably bad movie; the most eccentric thing about this sequel is its title.  Theres still plenty of basketball-metaphor life advice but it now comes from the mouth of narrator Cedric (Kevin Hart) who intersperses relationship truisms with only slightly less spurious factoids about the movies setting. (""People have been coming to Las Vegas for over 100 years"" is technically true in that someone must have visited one of the isolated desert communitys 800 or so residents in 1914.) Working under the mistaken assumption (never addressed) that he has been selected as the best man for the wedding of Michael (Terrence Jenkins) and Candace (Regina Hall) Cedric arrives in Vegas in a rented Lamborghini (never seen again) and books the most expensive suite in Caesars Palace to host the bachelor party. Meanwhile Candaces bridesmaids (including Meagan Good Taraji P. Henson and Gabrielle Union all predictably wasted) plan their own night on the town away from the disapproving stink-eye of the brides future mother-in-law (Jenifer Lewis). ""High jinks"" ensue relationships are discussed and timed-to-release-date jokes are made about Jersey Boys and Game Of Thrones.  There isnt a lot that could be said about Think Like A Man Too that wouldnt apply to countless other similar productions. The wall-to-wall soundtrack ranges from the hackneyed to the grating ""Luck Be A Lady"" ""Big Spender"" ""Sexy And I Know It"" ""2 Legit 2 Quit."" Theres plenty of awkward product placement. There are congratulatory cameos from a boxer a rapper and a 90s nostalgia touchstone. The characters have burgeoning careers in such rom-com growth industries as magazine publishing and wedding-dress design. The same stock aerial shots licensed for every bad movie set in Vegas are used to bridge scenes. There is a dress-buying montage. A popular song is lip-synched to in its entirety. At one point while the bachelor party group is walking down a hallway in slow motion one of the members makes a funny face.Though barely funny Think Like A Man Too serves a clear cultural purpose providing viewers with their semi-annual reminder that we live in a profoundly broken society in which the only movies that can guarantee a budget and substantial distribution with a predominantly black cast are corny ensemble comedies set around weddings.

Its more of the same puerile gender politics only this time with less Steve Harvey and much much more Kevin Hart. Their antics at The Hustler Club land Dominic (Michael Ealy) Jeremy (Jerry Ferrara) Isaac (Adrian Brody) Cedric (Kevin Hart) Bennett (Gary Owen) Michael (Terrence J) Terrell (David Walton) and Zeke (Romany Malco) in trouble in the film Think Like A Man Too. Credit Sony Pictures. (Photo Sony Pictures )Story HighlightsSecond verse same as the first only this time in Las Vegas.Steve Harvey is out of the picture which leaves much more room for Kevin Harts shenanigans.Film is overstuffed with characters all of whom have predictable problems.The original ""Think Like a Man"" apparently did so well director Tim Story and crew decided to make the same movie again only this time in Vegas.OK its not quite the same movie. Its even a little bit better. The first film based on the relationship-advice books of TV personality Steve Harvey amounted to little more than a feature-length infomercial for Harveys puerile brand of gender politics.Those are very much still in play. The gang hits the strip for a weekend of organized debauchery in the form of bachelor and bachelorette parties followed by a wedding for one of the couples. The men and women promptly divide into opposing teams each trying to ""win"" the weekend in a remarkably tame battle of the sexes that mostly involves drinking alcoholic beverages out of ridiculous glasses and complaining about significant others.Horror-movie strings play at the sight of a wedding dress. When one dude expresses joy at the prospect of marrying the woman he loves another dude asks ""Did you remember to wax your vagina?"" later admonishing him to ""Think like a man""So thats still lame. But Harvey has thankfully stepped aside. That makes more room for the Kevin Hart Show. Harts career has exploded in the two years since ""Think Like a Man"" was released and the film capitalizes on that by giving him free reign to bounce around the movie like hes just downed a six-pack of Red Bull. Its a welcome injection of energy up to a point.His character Cedric is acting as best man for sweetly sincere Michael (Terrence Jenkins) whos marrying Candace (Regina Hall) much to the chagrin of his overbearing mother Loretta (Jenifer Lewis) who relishes her role as monster-in-law.But the couples not headed down the aisle together are going through their own problems and its all more of the same. Career-obsessed Lauren (Taraji P. Henson) doesnt tell Dominic (Michael Ealy) when shes offered the position of COO of a ""global media group"" which would relocate her to New York City. Zeke (Romany Malco) cant outrun his ""Zeke the Freak"" past and his girlfriend Mya (Meagan Good) grows weary of running into his old flames. And Kristen (Gabrielle Union) wants a baby but her pothead partner Jeremy (Jerry Ferrara) has reservations.Theyre all such predictable problems with predictable resolutions especially in a Vegas party this glossy and tame. Its the PG-13 version of ""The Hangover"" and more than anything thats just boring.Review Think Like a Man Too 2.5 starsDirector Tim Story.Cast Kevin Hart Michael Ealy Taraji P. Henson Gabrielle Union.Rating PG-13 for crude sexual content including references partial nudity language and drug material.Reach the reporter at barbara.vandenburgharizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8371. 4 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//azc.cc/1imKM4m More Stories Roberts Pence working to overturn Trumps media ban July 29 2016 1201 p.m. Montini Pence decries name-calling.

Henson Regina Hall Gabrielle Union rear Wendi McLendon-Covey star in ""Think Like A Man Too.""       Photo AP MOVIE REVIEW Think Like A Man Too Running time 106 min. Rated PG-13 (drug use suggestive language). At the E-Walk 34th Street others. If ""Think Like a Man Too"" was a man he would be the worlds worst date humorless shrill speaking primarily in cliches (""what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas"") and absolutely terrified of women. This sequel to the 2012 romantic comedy plucked from the wisdom of Steve Harveys dating manual sees the cast and director Tim Story reunited for the wedding of mamas boy Michael (Terrence J) and single mom Candace (Regina Hall). Overlaid by screechy narration from Kevin Harts comic-relief Cedric the plot involves the genders dividing into opposing ""teams"" (because men and women are different see?) competing to out-debauch each other the night before the nuptials. The way this played out made me long for the subtle comic stylings of ""The Hangover."" Part III. Kevin Hart center as Cedric in a scene from ""Think Like A Man Too.""Photo AP Take for example the men (Hart J Jerry Ferrara Michael Ealy Romany Malco Gary Owen) deciding they must enter a strip-club contest to pay off Cedrics debt. After a promising pan through the group squirming into ""Magic Mike"" garb their stage debut is thwarted by a brawl. Let me assure you any woman whos endured this much cinematic flaccidity is going to be mighty annoyed she was denied the sight of Ealy gyrating in a firemans outfit. Moreover the scene embodies the main problem with ""TLAM2."" It never just delivers the joke. Nearly every scene is performed as if theres a big punch line coming and theres no payoff. (If this movie was a guy hed also be terrible in bed.) Elsewhere the bachelorette-party gals (Hall Gabrielle Union Meagan Good Taraji P. Henson Wendi McLendon-Covey) accidentally eat some strong marijuana -- a lazy but effective setup for hallucinogenic antics. Nothing really comes of it other than Unions character having an ""a-ha"" moment the next morning. The closest the film comes to funny is Hart sputtering indignantly at regular intervals which hes pretty good at. But like his character doing a ""Risky Business"" dance in his palatial Vegas villa the guys all alone out there. At one point Adam Brodys character snaps a jokey bachelors-night ball and chain onto Michaels ankle (""Black men dont put chains on black men"" Cedric observes in a rare moment of actual dark humor) -- and this is the way most of the cast seemed to me a talented group of actors shackled to a crappy regressive script. If this is what thinking like a man entails Ill stick with my lady brain thanks.
