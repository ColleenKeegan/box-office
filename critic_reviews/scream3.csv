Comments Scream 3 Scream and Scream 2--slasher parodies or slasher-parody parodies written by Kevin Williamson--were marked by self-reference. This sequel written by Ehren Kruger is slower more earnest and not as gory and its less-cagey tone is reflected in the less-stylized directing by Wes Craven (who also directed the other two) and in the frequent night scenes and scenes set in dim interiors. New characters are introduced and killed off as Neve Campbell faces an ordeal shed hoped was over while the movie belabors the idea that its the last of a trilogy rather than the third in a series. With Courteney Cox Arquette and David Arquette. 116 min.

Then along came Scream (1996 R 1 hr. 51 mins.) the in-joke killer thriller that took all of the wheeziest cliches of the Freddy/Jason/ Michael Myers golden age and reflected them in a fun-house mirror. The characters lining up for the bloody body count were now pop-saturated teens weaned on horror movies. They could recite the ""rules"" of these films one minute and fall victim to them the next. Now Scream and its two sequels are making their Blu-ray debuts with EXTRAS held over from previous DVD incarnations. And 15 years on Wes Cravens kickoff installment holds up the best especially the terrifying opening in which Drew Barrymore is stalked over the phone. In hindsight the rest of the film feels a bit like a setup for the trilogy that writer Kevin Williamson said he always had in mind with Neve Campbells virginal Sidney Prescott being hunted by a maniac in a ghost-face mask. Eager to keep the cash registers humming Scream 2 (1997 R 2 hrs.) followed a year later. This time Courteney Coxs icy reporter and David Arquettes dim deputy got juicier roles while the rest of the cast of disposable archetypes deadpanned about why ""sequels suck"" -- a particularly funny joke since this one didnt. Suckiness would have to wait for Scream 3 (2000 R 1 hr. 57 mins.) a limp movie-within-a-movie parody that closed the trilogy with a fizzle instead of the bang it deserved. The irony of course is that this splatter saga was done in by the same tired tropes it satirized. Still redemption may be at hand as Scream 4 hits theaters on April 15. Lets hope theres more giddy life to be wrung from grisly death. Scream A? Scream 2 B Scream 3 C? Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

It should be noted that director Wes Craven found a way to extend another franchise by making one more ""New Nightmare"" after the deceptively titled ""Freddys Dead The Final Nightmare."" Hyped as the ""final chapter"" in a spoofy-spooky trilogy ""Scream 3"" is a crafty and well-crafted wrap-up that really does bring a satisfying sense of closure to the franchise. Of course it should be noted that director Wes Craven found a way to extend another franchise by making one more ""New Nightmare"" (1994) after the deceptively titled ""Freddys Dead The Final Nightmare"" (1991). It should also be noted that in the extremely likely event that ""Scream 3"" scores as well at the box office as its two phenomenally successful predecessors audiences might not have seen the last of the knife-wielding bogeyman in the Edvard Munch-style Halloween mask. Much like ""Scream"" and ""Scream 2"" the third installment slices and dices slasher-movie cliches with a serrated edge of self-reflexive satire. Most of the action revolves around the filming of -- wink-wink nudge-nudge -- ""Stab 3"" the second sequel to a pic based on the ""real-life"" events of the first ""Scream."" A running gag involves repeated warnings to expect the unexpected because the last chapter in a trilogy always breaks the rules. To underscore that point ""Scream 3"" begins by disposing of a prominent survivor from the first two pics. Its a cheeky touch easily the most audacious thing in the scenario. Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) the franchises amazingly resourceful heroine is reintroduced as a veritable hermit living in an isolated rural area far from her hometown of Woodsboro. Understandably paranoid after her past experiences with masked murderers she remains out of the loop throughout the first hour or so as pic focuses on the killings of ""Stab 3"" cast members. Telejournalist Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox Arquette) reduced to doing a tabloid show after bombing as a ""60 Minutes II"" correspondent sees another chance to elevate her profile when real murders interrupt the fake mayhem of ""Stab 3."" Arriving on the Hollywood set shes uneasy about reuniting with ex-sweetheart Dewey Riley (David Arquette) the former Woodsboro police deputy. And shes annoyed by the strident Method mannerisms of Jennifer Jolie (indie staple Parker Posey) who has been signed to play the Gale Weathers character -- and who has hired Dewey as technical adviser and ahem bodyguard. Director Roman Bridger (Scott Foley) doesnt take it well when publicity-conscious studio chiefs halt production on ""Stab 3"" in the wake of what appear to be copycat killings. (Roger Corman makes a fleeting appearance as a producer who warns ""Violence in cinema is a big deal right now"") The photogenic young actors cast as ""Stab 3"" leads (Jenny McCarthy Deon Richmond Emily Mortimer Matt Keeslar) are only slightly less disappointed even though it quickly becomes clear that yet another masked murderer is on the prowl -- and worse that the actors may be killed in the same order that their characters die in the film. Detective Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey) an LAPD homicide investigator with a pronounced interest in movies agrees to share info with Gale Weathers in order to figure out why all the victims are found with photos of Sidney Prescotts long-dead mother. But Kincaid would really prefer to speak with Sidney herself. Eventually the plucky ""Scream"" queen comes out of hiding to take a more active role in the proceedings arousing the bloodlust of a killer whose identity is a genuine surprise. While sticking scrupulously close to the tone and style of Kevin Williamsons ""Scream"" and ""Scream 2"" screenplays writer Ehren Kruger (""Arlington Road"" ""Reindeer Games"") adds just enough new wrinkles to keep things interesting. A few characters are disappointingly underdeveloped -- much more could have been done with Mortimers tremulous starlet for instance -- but the in-jokey humor is up to series standards while the thrills cheap and otherwise are abundant. Kruger even finds a way to bring video-store geek Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) back from the grave via videotape to once again remind one and all about horror movie conventions. In the third installment of ""a true trilogy"" he notes  one should be on the lookout for ""an unexpected backstory"" that will upend a few long-held assumptions and resolve all dangling plot threads. Think of this as the screenwriting equivalent of an elbow in the ribs. Other clever touches include a brief walk-on by Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes as the slackers they portrayed in ""Clerks"" and ""Dogma"" and a cameo appearance by Carrie Fisher as an ex-starlet whos still bitter about not being cast in ""Star Wars."" Lance Henriksen doesnt have nearly enough to do as the schlockmeister ""Stab 3"" producer who may know something about the checkered past of Sidneys mother. But many details of the film-within-a-film production -- including Richmonds edgy complaints about career opportunities for African-American actors -- are amusing and dead-on. As usual Craven generates serious suspense even while his characters comment on the plot mechanics employed to achieve that suspense. By now Campbell Arquette and Cox Arquette are perfectly attuned to Cravens wavelength and offer performances enhanced by self-mockery. Posey a newcomer to the ""Scream"" series easily slips into the spirit of things as her character insists that shes a better Gale Weathers than Gale Weathers. In terms of production values ""Scream 3"" is a slick package of surefire elements. Unlike ""Wes Cravens New Nightmare"" which could be enjoyed on its own terms without knowing much about its predecessors this ""final chapter"" requires at least a passing familiarity with the series first two films. Aficionados will be the best able to appreciate how wittily Craven has brought down the curtain on his much-imitated genre-reviving series.

Starring Neve Campbell Courteney CQ Cox Arquette David Arquette Parker Posey and Jenny McCarthy. Directed by Wes Craven. Written by Ehren Kruger. (R. 116 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Having recovered from his foray into good taste in the Meryl Streep movie ""Music of the Heart"" Wes Craven is back on familiar turf with ""Scream 3"" the last segment in what he promises is a trilogy. Campy overwrought and gleefully cannibalistic in the way it references and regurgitates horror flicks of yore ""Scream 3"" fulfills its modest ambitions by delivering a glib slasher spoof for the mall crowd. Related Stories Craven Cuts Up in `Scream 3 / Last in trilogy pokes fun at Hollywood This time the plot spins out in Hollywood where a movie called ""Stab 3"" is being shot -- not surprisingly with the same kind of airbrushed actors and zippy dialogue that we get in ""Scream 3."" Unlike ""Scream"" which had a serial killer copying slasher-movie murders or ""Scream 2"" which had a killer terrorizing a college campus ""Scream 3"" offers a series of stabbings that imitates the screenplay of the movie-within-the movie. Got that? So when a starlet played by Jenny McCarthy reads her script and moans that shes the second victim in ""Stab 3"" -- meaning that her screen time is minimal -- you can be sure that McCarthys fate in ""Scream 3"" is identical. It helps to have seen the first and second parts of the ""Scream"" trilogy which Craven directed from Kevin Williamsons witty screenplays. For the rest of us theres diversion in a thicket of plot twists false clues and slasher-movie cliches -- fashioned this time by San Francisco writer Ehren Kruger (""Arlington Road""). Courteney Cox Arquette and David Arquette who met making ""Scream"" are back in ""S3"" playing bitchy tabloid journalist Gale Weathers and clumsy aw-shucks sheriff Dewey Riley. Also back are Liev Schreiber as talk-show host Cotton Weary and Neve Campbell as Sidney Prescott the plucky heroine who this time gleans shocking information about her mothers long-ago murder. None of that returning quartet is safe from a masked killer who uses the ""Stab 3"" script as a blueprint for mayhem -- any more than theyre safe from co-star Parker Posey. Cast as Jennifer Jolie the airhead who plays Coxs character in the movie- within-the movie Posey finds line readings odd business and funny faces that come out of nowhere and more often than not work brilliantly. Shes got that grasping watch- me-this-time energy that Sean P. Hayes brings to his sidekick character on ""Will amp; Grace."" Neither actor is capable of not swatting a line out of the ballpark -- which makes one contemplate the buffoonery they might inspire in each other (if they didnt murder each other first). Since ""S3"" speaks the language of genre-spoofing its fitting that one of the cameos is filled by Carrie Fisher an actress-writer whose entire career practically has consisted of holding mirrors up to showbiz twaddle and sham. Fisher plays a sardonic studio drone who gets mistaken for that actress who played Princess Leia in ""Star Wars."" As Fisher has matured her always-low voice has gotten deeper more world-weary. Its a voice that doesnt match that tiny body but might easily double for Chill Wills the late character actor who dubbed the voice of ""Francis the Talking Mule."" Its a voice you could hang wallpaper on patch asphalt with. Fisher makes Bea Arthur sound like Melanie Griffith and puts buzz saws in the mood for mating season. ..

"Scream 3 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; scream-3 ) Scream 3 (United States 2000) A movie review by James Berardinelli They say the third times a charm. In the case of the Scream movie series the Wes Craven/Kevin Williamson collaboration credited for having revived the slasher genre in the 90s this clichA(c) proves to be a falsehood. The most recent (and hopefully final) chapter in the comedy/horror trilogy comes across as a lame regurgitation of material already presented. There are no real surprises and the whole affair has the feeling of something left too long in the pot to stew. The life and energy is gone. What began as a lively intelligent series suffused with self-referential humor has turned into just another slice-and-dice-by-numbers affair. Scream 3 isnt just the weakest of the movies its the kind of thing that the original Scream lampooned with affectionate glee. All of our old friends are back - even one who didnt survive the second installment - although virtually everyone looks tired of the project. Even director Wes Craven doesnt seem to have his heart in it. (He agreed to direct this movie only after Miramax allowed him to helm the non-horror l""gt;Music of the Heart.) Neve Campbells screen time as Sidney Prescott has been dramatically reduced - she hardly appears during the movies first half which concentrates on the exploits of Dewey (David Arquette) and Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox Arquette). They are in Hollywood on the set of the movie Stab 3 where members of the cast are being eviscerated in the same order that their characters were offed in the screenplay. The killer leaves behind a picture of Sidneys mother at each crime scene. An LAPD homicide detective named Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey) wants to bring in Sidney for questioning but shes in hiding - until the killer finds her and she decides that seclusion is no longer the answer. So the whole group is united in Tinseltown for another round of mayhem and murder in which just about every supporting character ends up with a knife in his or her back. Scream 3 features three good moments but theyre hardly enough to save the movie from the tedious spiral of repetitiveness it is trapped in. The first is a from-beyond-the-grave video lecture by Randy (Jamie Kennedy) who offers up the ""rules of the trilogy."" For example ""events in the third segment always go back to the beginning"" and ""even the hero can die in the final chapter."" (One that he doesnt mention and which proves true in this case is that the final installment of any trilogy is usually the worst. The examples Randy cites Star Wars and The Godfather are classic examples of this.) Then theres a brief cameo by cult heroes Jay and Silent Bob who are given a couple of lines (well at least Jay is. Finally Carrie Fisher appears as a receptionist who bemoans not having gotten the part of Princess Leia in Star Wars because she wouldnt sleep with George Lucas. When it comes to storyline character development and pacing Scream 3 strikes out. The movie drags along from one predictable slaying to the next and the only real scares along the way are the ""boo"" moments when something innocuous jumps out of the shadows just before the real killer strikes. Meanwhile the level of humor in Scream 3 is way down. Parker Posey (as the actress playing Gale in the Stab series) has a few amusing lines but the ironic dialogue and cute references to other horror films which were wearing thin in Scream 2 are now positively threadbare. The protagonists - Sidney Dewey and Gale - who actually seemed like real people in the other movies are reduced to cookie cutter impressions of their previous selves. They look the same and sound the same but theres no depth. And theyre always finding new ways to get separated from each other and trapped in dark places. We get a lot of backstory on Sidney and her mother but its all pretty pointless. And for those who like to play the killer guessing game there isnt any purpose. Despite numerous red herrings theres no way to logically deduce the culprits identity. Once the unmasking occurs the story is forced to go through a number of improbable gyrations to make things sound vaguely plausible. But by then I had lost interest. I was beginning to wish the masked murderer would dispatch everyone who was still alive including herself/himself so that the movie could end. Once I wrote that Scream 3 would have to do something radical or inventive to avoid becoming tiresome. Unfortunately theres nothing here that even the most inexperienced horror film fan would call innovative and the predictable result is a movie that pales in comparison with its predecessors. Thus far 2000 has been a very bad year for films and Scream 3 does nothing to reverse the trend.

(Are you with me?) Since Cox Arquettes Gale is on hand as well the casting in theory should be zestily playful Posey who delivers each line as if it fell between ironic quote marks playing a cheesy scream queen cast as a TV star in a schlock horror movie based in part on how that same TV stars life became a schlock horror movie for real. (Are you still with me?) Somehow though whats clever in the abstract turns out to be chintzy and listless on screen. In ""Scream 3"" we look at Parker Posey and we see a skinny likable actress stuck in a flabby tired sequel and we look at Courteney Cox Arquette and we see ANOTHER skinny likable actress stuck in a flabby tired sequel. It doesnt even matter whos playing whom. In ""Scream 3"" the B-movie hall of mirrors has collapsed in on itself. ""Ive heard this s-- before"" screams Sidney (Neve Campbell) our heroine glaring into the face of a black-caped lunatic. The audience may share the sentiment. In ""Scream 3"" there are a few queasy funny moments like the opening scene with Liev Schreiber melting from lust to fear as the killer reaching him on a cell phone puts on a sultry groupie voice that quickly turns manly and menacing. Mostly though the film feels nearly as patched together as the potboilers its satirizing. The ""Stab 3"" premise turns out to be little more than microwaved ""Scream 2"" and Campbell mopey and isolated seems to be acting in another picture entirely. Like ""Scream"" and its energized (if rather joyless) sequel ""Scream 3"" was directed by Wes Craven but its the first film in the series not to be written by Kevin Williamson and you feel the loss. The new screenwriter Ehren Kruger (""Arlington Road"") doesnt know how to have fun entangling us in the idiot/intricate machinations of old slasher movies. In ""Scream 3"" the psycho-with-a-knife postmodernism is messy and slipshod because the films precocious awareness of horror cliches doesnt extend to anything beyond the first two ""Scream"" films. In a brief tantalizing bit delivered on videotape a frantic geek outlines the hallowed rules that always guide the final chapters of trilogies. His speech turns out to be a tease though. About the only second-sequel rule ""Scream 3"" ends up conforming to is the one that says the films heroes must blather on about characters from the past whom the audience couldnt possibly care less about. Of course what the movie is really waxing nostalgic over isnt a handful of terror-spoof ciphers; its the success of ""Scream"" and ""Scream 2"" Perhaps ""Scream 3"" will match it but about the only thing the movie kills with any decisiveness is your time.
