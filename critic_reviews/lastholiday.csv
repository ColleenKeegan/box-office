A slightly odd set-up indeed (which made more sense in the JB Priestley-scripted 1950 British original with Alec Guinness) but it allows Latifah to swing pleasingly into no-more-bullshit mode and tell her scheming retail magnate former employer and palm-greasing local senator exactly what she thinks of them. Yes they just happen to be staying at the Grand Hotel Pupp too. Funny that. By rights this combination of coincidence and heaped-on sentiment should be a truly dreadful movie but director Wayne Wangs steady hand makes the underlying carpe diem theme essentially quite touching while cherishable Latifah is simply a walking magnet for the audiences goodwill. Its not exactly distinguished but pleasantly warm-hearted and the sort of thing you might enjoy on afternoon TV when laid up with the flu.

Once a bittersweet Alec Guinness comedy ""Last Holiday"" has now been transformed into a broad and brassy Queen Latifah vehicle. Surprisingly its watchable. In its corny cartoonish way it even suggests a generosity of spirit thats faithful to the 1950 original. Both movies are based on a J.B. Priestley script about an unexceptional person who is given just a few weeks to live -- and decides to go out in style. In the new version the timid Guinness character has been rewritten as an irrepressible New Orleans cookware saleswoman who blows all her savings at an expensive European hotel. Movie review Showtimes and trailer""Last Holiday"" with Queen Latifah LL Cool J. Directed by Wayne Wang from a screenplay by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman based on a script by J.B. Priestley. 112 minutes. Rated PG-13 for some sexual references. Several theaters. Flaunting her wealth she attracts the attention of a corrupt senator (Giancarlo Esposito) a selfish businessman (Timothy Hutton) his insecure mistress (Alicia Witt) and a master chef (Gerard Depardieu) who is impressed when she orders all the specials on his pricey menu. Soon shes in the kitchen sharing tips on favorite recipes. Shes also in love with a fellow worker (LL Cool J) who is distressed when she quits her job and vanishes. He follows her to Europe where she becomes astonishingly successful as a gambler and as the life of every party. Director Wayne Wang (""Smoke"") and the screenwriting team of Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman (""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"") cant be accused of subtlety or delicacy but they clearly recognize that with the right star this thing just might work. And the right star is definitely Queen Latifah who has never before been given such a foolproof laughter-and-tears package to play with.

Starring Queen Latifah LL Cool J Timothy Hutton and Gerard Depardieu. Directed by Wayne Wang. PG-13. 112 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) At the first sight of Queen Latifah corseted into a prim raincoat and looking washed out with her hair pulled back in an unflattering bun its obvious an extreme makeover is in her future. The problem with ""Last Holiday"" is that everything else that transpires is equally predictable. Latifahs latest vehicle inexorably marches toward an ending you can see coming from the first reel. Heck the trailer alone provides the necessary evidence. This harmless bit of fluff lacks the element of surprise but is not without random charming moments supplied by its incandescent star. Cast against type she radiates warmth as Georgia Byrd a mousy sales clerk with a knack for moving cookware at a moribund New Orleans department store while daydreaming of becoming a chef. Latifah can out-smile Julia Roberts and seem sincere in the process. Georgia is a variation on Roberts ""Pretty Woman"" whose own ancestry traces back to Cinderella. These fairy tales share the enchanting notion that anybody can be transformed into a VIP with the help of a savvy fairy godmother or fashion designer. The metamorphosis of Georgia begins ominously. After hitting her head she undergoes a CAT scan right at her place of work (giving new meaning to the term comprehensive department store). Shes diagnosed with something called Lampingtons disease and given at most a month to live. If youve gotta go this is an ideal malady as Georgia exhibits no symptoms and in another predictable outcome only wonderful things result from the illness. It energizes her to blow her entire savings on a lavish stay at a five-star Central European hotel which is high on her wish list because the kitchen is run by a chef she idolizes. Gerard Depardieu plays the role broadly as if hes wandered in from the set of ""The Producers."" He barks out orders to underlings and rolls his eyes when diet-conscious rich Americans insist on substitutions. The dishes he prepares -- five of them for Georgia who orders everything on the menu -- are presented in mouth-watering splendor. Within a week shes sauteing by the acclaimed chefs side. And cooking is just one of several talents Georgia discovers she possesses. Her first time on skis she makes it down a mountain at record speed and continues to exhibit fearlessness by parachuting off a treacherously steep dam. Georgia gives an obnoxious titan of the retail world (Timothy Hutton with a continual smirk on his face) his comeuppance and lectures a couple of congressmen about the ethics of doing business with him. She proves herself a pro at suicide prevention. And can she ever shop Judging from the extensive designer wardrobe acquired on her holiday half her remaining days were spent in boutiques. An awful lot makes no sense in Jeffrey Price and Peter Seamans script starting with its basic premise. Georgia packs her bags after an HMO turns down her request for lifesaving surgery (the movie never explains why). But watching her decide to fly first class on a whim and drop 4000 a night on the presidential suite and countless thousands more on finery it seems she could have afforded a down payment on the operation. At least the screenwriters cook up a credible prince charming for her a fellow clerk whos left minding the store when she goes abroad. Hes played by LL Cool J who like Latifah is a successful rap artist turned actor. The two are well matched able to turn on the charm at will but also hold back in early scenes when their characters are too shy to acknowledge their feelings for each other. Director Wayne Wang showcases their emerging affections bringing out the chemistry between his co-stars. Wang whos from San Francisco was considered a cutting-edge filmmaker in early work like ""Chan Is Missing"" and ""Smoke."" But hes gone Hollywood with ""Maid in Manhattan"" and ""Last Holiday"" and gotten sloppy while doing so. A youngster who at first appears to be Georgias son is never adequately identified. Its touching to glimpse pre-Katrina New Orleans. But every time the action shifts there Wang announces it by trotting out a Garden District streetcar clanging its way through the city. Should he decide to make another movie in the Bay Area theres a bridge with star quality hell want to check out. -- Advisory This film contains mild sexual references.

Not much probably. You might have time for a few pints of Ben amp; Jerrys while updating your will saying goodbye to loved ones and deciding whom to entrust with that Disraeli Gears album. Then toodle-oo. Three weeks over. Klonk. But if youre Georgia Byrd this is what youd do Youd cash in your IRA sell your mamas bonds and spend the whole whupping load on a midwinter trip to the Czech Republic where you would tickle your every fancy at the Grandhotel Pupp (say ""poop""). While there you would hobnob with VIPs and in so hobnobbing come to be viewed as a VIP yourself issuing simple searingly honest observations that are received as mind-altering profundities by everyone around you or everyone who never saw Being There. Chances are nobodys seen Last Holiday a 1950 Alec Guinness film about a modest salesman afflicted with ""Lampingtons disease"" who heads to a seaside resort where he buoys all who meet him and learns in his last days to live. It didnt need to be remade but most films dont need to be remade and that didnt stop Jonathan Demme from mucking around with Charade. This latest LastHoliday -- from director Wayne Wang who drew gentle magic from Because of Winn-Dixie -- is a mild fangless forgettable thing that entertains some and offends little barring one obnoxious subcontinental stereotype and a cloying urge to make everybody chipper at the end. Gone is the originals dusky ironic closure. Gone is Guinness replaced by the ordinarily amazing Queen Latifah here reduced in amazingness by Wangs pallid direction. There are amusing bits and there are sweet bits and there are bits involving northern Europeans with garbled phlegmy accents and funny hair but most of these bits are accompanied by maudlin strings. The nub of the movie is Georgias impregnable goodness; she may sell cookware for a living but she can tell these big snots excuse me big shots a thing or two about basic human kindness. Among the characters she meets in the Pupp are a bearish chef (a very Gerard Depardieuish Gerard Depardieu) a glad-handing senator (the sadly underused Giancarlo Esposito) and a jerk retail giant who owns the store where Georgia works. This jerk is ably rendered by Timothy Hutton who began his career as a downy anguished youth but now looks as pitiless and serrated as a steak knife. By contrast the films fluffiest male presence is LL Cool J as Georgias love interest meekly making googly eyes amid the fuss. Wangs Last Holiday reminds me of that creaky old joke (with a spoiler so beware) about the guy whose eyes pop out hair falls out skin turns green and tongue swells up. Told hell die in three weeks he blows his lifes savings on wine dames clothes. A tailor asks him his neck size. ""Fourteen"" the guy says. ""Cant be"" says the tailor. ""If you wear 14 your eyes will pop out your hair will fall out your skin will turn green and your tongue will swell up."" Ba-da boom. Its a groaner all right. Sorry I wasted your time. If you have three weeks to live Im doubly sorry because every last minute is precious.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Its easy to hail the Queen - Latifah that is. She was one of hip-hops first to make the transition from rap to ""its a wrap."" And over the past decade her onscreen comfort zone has only grown and deepened. Even when the vehicle shes driving hasnt been roadworthy - remember ""Taxi"" with Jimmy Fallon - shes usually upheld her end with irrepressible appeal. And sometimes more. In 2002 she was nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe for her supporting role as prison matron Mama Morton in ""Chicago."" One of her edgiest roles as a bank robber in 1996s ""Set It Off"" got her an Independent Spirit Award nomination. It will be exciting when she finds a film that honors her leading-lady chops. Thats another way of saying the often-sweet but middling ""Last Holiday"" isnt it. Directed by Wayne Wang (""The Joy Luck Club"") this comedy about a woman who goes on a Euro-spree when she learns she has weeks to live is more candy corn than Capra corn. Too bad. Because embedded in Georgia Byrds sojourn are some truths about the working class worth pondering. Still Latifah struts enough of her stuff to give the movie some guilt-free pleasures. Georgia works in the cookware section of Kragens a fictional department store in New Orleans. While selling Calphalon and Le Creuset Georgia whips up Emeril Lagasse-style eats for the customers. ""Moochers"" her micromanaging boss calls them. Hes a midlevel louse and a devotee of retail guru Matthew Kragens management theories the gist of which can be summed up by the title of his book ""Young Hip Rich."" At night Georgia goes home and sharpens her kitchen skills watching the Food Network. Bam She serves her tween neighbor a delectable dish then digs into her Lean Cuisine. Georgia is a woman who dreams big but lives hunkered within her means. She also nurses a crush on Sean Matthews (LL Cool J). (The hip-hop stars winning presence provides still more evidence of why rappers continue to be go-to performers for casting directors.) During a pas de deux of awkward flirting Georgia hits her head. Shes told by the company physician Dr. Gupta that she has a rare virus that has led to a terminal condition. She has three weeks to live. Its a flimsy setup. And if it seems familiar in a old-movie way its because ""Last Holiday"" is an update of a 1950 British movie starring Alec Guinness as the terminal vacationer. The plot takes our God-loving frugal gourmet who has never been ""north of Mobile Alabama"" to the swank Grandhotel Pupp in the Czech Republic. Because ""Last Holiday"" shamelessly embraces coincidence not only is Kragen (Timothy Hutton) there with a woman not his wife (Alicia Witt) he also has a congressman and a senator in tow. Speaking of coincidence Louisiana Sen. Dillings (Giancarlo Esposito) was scheduled to appear at Georgias church the week before to discuss community redevelopment. He was a no-show. As Georgias life wanes other lives will be transformed. Nary a one of these epiphanies surprises - but a few charm. When Georgia gives Ms. Burns (Witt) a dressing down in the spa its a lesson not so much in civility as in class camaraderie. And Gerard Depardieu playing one of Georgias culinary heroes provides a nice tone shift. (An alternate title could be ""Georgias Feast."") Too many middle-of-the-road comedies dont invite critical ire so much as ""what might have been"" regrets. ""Last Holiday"" is so willfully ebullient it has trouble with its nastier characters and themes corruption graft arrogance. Old Hollywood by way of Billy Wilder and Frank Capra was much better at screwy humor and social commentary. Wang does heartstrings better than hilarity. A silly snowboarding scene feels ski-lifted from ""I Love Lucy."" Of course he does have it half right We do love Latifah. The 1950 version of ""Last Holiday"" is described as a black comedy. One is left to wonder Just because this one features an African-American lead does that mean it must shy away from its darker shadings? For a movie about overcoming fear and living out loud ""Last Holidays"" too-tidy conclusion isnt a sign of hope so much as a lack of nerve.

"Queen Latifah is a joy to behold in poignant Last Holiday - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Queen Latifah is a joy to behold in poignant Last Holiday By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  January 13 2006 Queen Latifah is a buxom woman from New Jersey who used to wear Afrocentric pantsuits and rap about sisters standing up for themselves. Now she sells Pizza Hut pizza makes lite-jazz records and stars in disposable hit comedies. No one looks at her and thinks Julia Roberts."" But Last Holiday"" in its feathery good-hearted way is enough to give you pause.Latifah plays a plainspoken churchgoing penny pincher and aspiring chef named Georgia Byrd who after shes given three weeks to live finds the old new lease on life. She quits her job selling cookware at a New Orleans department store takes her ample savings and flies to Prague where she checks into the 4000-a-night presidential suite at the gargantuan Grandhotel Pupp. Latifah frees her hair from her bun tries on an evening gown and turns ravishing by the 30-minute mark.There might be comedy in watching a voluptuous African-American woman drop a lot of cash in front of surprised white Europeans. But this movie has better things to do. Latifah for one thing doesnt put a chip on Georgias shoulder. Georgias take-me-as-I-am personality is a big hit with the hotel staff which is presumably thrilled to serve a woman who is one of them. She of course treats them all like old friends.The hotel happens to be crawling with people loosely connected to Georgias American life the sniveling owner (Timothy Hutton) of her old department store is in cahoots with the Louisiana senator (Giancarlo Esposito) whos off on a ski weekend when he should be meeting the congregation at her church. They and their friends see Georgia looking fabulous palling around with the Pupps chef (Gerard Depardieu who else?) and receiving the staffs attention and assume shes a bigwig too. She never forgets where she came from but is pleased to have the company.The supporting cast which includes Ranjit Chowdhry as Georgias nincompoop doctor and Susan Kellerman as a severe Swede is top-notch. And LL Cool J who plays Georgias love interest a co-worker named Sean has never been so boyish. I dont know whose idea this was (two tough rap legends jaunting in Hollywood froth) but the irony is inspired.Last Holiday"" is a remake of a 1950 Alec Guinness vehicle. But really its Pretty Woman"" for self-sufficient women who dont need a man but wouldnt mind having one around. When I mentioned Julia Roberts earlier its only because its the highest compliment you pay an actress when crowning a star. Still it sounds stale; when people talk about the next Julia Roberts"" theyve always conducted the search with dollar signs in their eyes.No one who caught Roberts when that silly movie first came out was thinking about her market potential. She just provoked a lot of the right feelings in people the most important being joy. Watching Latifah in Last Holiday"" left me with the same happiness. Director Wayne Wang and his screenwriters sometimes ape Pretty Woman."" But Latifahs obvious forebear is Pearl Bailey who was just as regal and straight-up.Even when she has a breakdown during a church sermon that turns into a riotous gospel number Latifah lowers the volume on her bawdiness. After Georgias diagnosis she pores over the dreams that now cant come true including a date with Sean and Latifah is so affectingly sad sitting there weeping at that kitchen table its all you can do not to get up and hold a Kleenex up to the screen. This part means something to her no matter how recycled it might seem.The movie extends that pride to its workaday New Orleans locations which were filmed before Hurricane Katrina struck and appear here as touching matters of fact. Georgias eventual homesickness gives Last Holiday"" an unintended but very real poignancy. Not only do we have the confirmation of a star we have a persuasive argument for rebuilding a city.

Gerard Depardieu and Queen Latifah play around in the kitchen in Last Holiday. Paramount The movie cliches are bearable mainly because the cast rises above the formulaic material. There are also some bona fide laughs to be had once the setting switches to a luxurious resort in the Czech Republic. Latifah plays Georgia a timid sales clerk who is told she is dying of a rare disease. She decides to take her savings and live it up for the three weeks she has left. Latifahs considerable comic ability makes the banal premise more winning than it ought to be. Though she has chosen some questionable movies like the offensively awful Bringing Down the House it is testimony to her talent that she can engage us in this vapid comedy. About the movie Last Holiday   1/2 (out of four) Stars Queen Latifah Timothy Hutton LL Cool J Gerard Depardieu Director Wayne Wang Distributor Paramount Pictures Rating PG-13 for some sexual references Running time 1 hour 50 minutes Opens Friday nationwide After she cashes in her funds Georgia takes a trip to a grand European resort site of some of the funnier moments. But an extended slapstick snowboarding sequence should have been edited if not jettisoned. Lack of originality is the films biggest flaw. The first half is a bit sluggish except for an eccentric performance by the doctor who diagnoses her rare condition (Ranjit Chowdhry). But in the second half we meet the hilarious Ms. Gunther (Susan Kellerman) an update of Young Frankensteins Frau Blucher and retail magnate Matthew Kragen (Timothy Hutton) who feels upstaged by the charismatic Georgia. Georgias chemistry with the man she has loved from afar played by the adorable LL Cool J takes off in the movies second half though you could argue she is more simpatico with Gerard Depardieu who plays a famous French chef. The frothy Last Holiday serves its purpose amusing escapism.

"Last Holiday Nothing to Lose a Lot to Like washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Last Holiday Nothing to Lose a Lot to Like After a grim diagnosis Georgia Byrd (Queen Latifah) learns how to live -- and express her feelings to her crush played by LL Cool J. (By Stephen Vaughan -- Associated Press) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday January 13 2006 Hmmm now let me see if I have this right . . . Queen Latifah is in the Alec Guinness role? Thats exactly what happens in ""Last Holiday"" and its surprising how well it works. After all Latifah isnt dragooned into playing either Guinnesss great Obi-Wan Kenobi or his even greater Colonel Nicholson the mad British officer who built the bridge on the River Kwai. Latifah plays Georgia Byrd as Guinness -- way back in 1950 and working from a screenplay from the once-famous British writer J.B. Priestley -- played George Bird. In both cases of course the situation is the same A somewhat mousy unprepossessing but definitely unfulfilled person is diagnosed with a soon-to-be-fatal illness. Wanting a last fling the doomed one cashes in the life savings and takes off for an exotic spot. But as he or she mingles with the rich habitues of such a milieu imminent death liberates him or her from a sense of social inferiority. Suddenly George and Georgia blossom as never before with charisma wisdom savoir-faire courage and grace. They may be dying but theyre definitely on the road to self-improvement. Indeed underneath it all in both its iterations ""Last Holiday"" decodes as a variant on J.M. Barries brilliant play ""The Admirable Crichton"" which argued that in a state of nature (either a desert island or an inhibition-destroying fatal diagnosis) a natural aristocracy of talent and sense would come to assert itself over distinctions that were simply class-based. Thus while ""Last Holiday"" is hardly a godsend or even a saintsend or a good-guysend its a good-hearted and kind-spirited if mild pleasure. It begins with Latifah proving once again the weird parallels between rap stardom and movie stardom. Both formats seem to be about a magical something called presence and Latifah even in a dialed-down quiet role like this one has it (as did for the record the great Guinness who could do more with less than nearly any actor alive; Ive just re-seen his fabulous ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" from 1979 in which he quietly dominates a whole menagerie of showoffs). As this version of the Priestley screenplay has it Georgia Byrd works in cookware in Kragens department store in New Orleans (the background of pre-flooded New Orleans bright and vibrant gives the movie an incidental melancholy). Shes the best salesclerk the most beloved staffer the most organized professional and humane yet of course the least recognized. Her boss (a prig) is abusive; her romantic ardor for a young man (LL Cool J) goes largely unnoticed. The death sentence is courtesy of a CAT scan that suggests she has three weeks left. She quits cashes in and heads to -- well I liked this touch even if I cant for the life of me figure out how filmmaker Wayne Wang picked it -- the Czech Republic actually to the ski-and-spa town of Karlovy Vary where she puts in at a five-star joint that looks like it was built in Anno Domini XIII by one of Octavians flouncier engineers. The old resort with its liveried staff its sense of Old World elegance and decorum its insistence on providing nine forks with every dish certainly feels fresh as a movie background when of course most of us were expecting banalities like Paris or London or St.-Tropez. Amid the splendors Georgias fundamental decency and good sense soon wins converts among the rich and famous including senators and congressmen and most pungently the very same Matthew Kragen her erstwhile employer and all-around snoot and twerp. This unpleasant fellow is played aggressively by Timothy Hutton who is usually cast in nice-guy roles. He seems to relish the bad-guy thing but . . . Memo to Tim Drink a milkshake bud. The guy couldnt weigh 112 pounds. Meg Ryan could clean his clock and the oversize Latifah could gobble him like an hors doeuvre in a nanosecond. Of surprises there are few of reversals there are none of expectations they are low. The movie is content to be a kind of middling expression of human decency Its never either terribly funny or terribly dramatic but Latifahs quiet solidity and common sense root it in ways that larger louder pictures never achieve. Last Holiday (112 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for mild sexual references.

As Georgia Byrd a prim department-store employee with big dreams a dull life in pre-Katrina New Orleans and a (mis)diagnosis of imminent death by symptomless disease the likably ballsy entertainer tucks her chin in dresses in garments of bilious beige panics at the attentions of a nice fellow employee (LL Cool J) and uses about a quarter of her lung power. But its a no-go. We want va-va-ha-ha-voom from our Queen and so we twiddle our thumbs through the setup until Georgia having decided (after weeping to the heavens) to blow her savings on a swanky European vacation throws off her cloister-wear and steps out in the eye-popping wardrobe and brash-but-warm tough-but-funny take-no-guff self-confidence that are the performers identifying marks. Then shes on message. A chaste and tepid remake of a 1950 British comedy in which Alec Guinness learned the benefits of living as if each day were his last this Last Holiday directed by Wayne Wang from a script by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman displays telltale symptoms of International Blanditis an unfortunate multinational co-production by-product in which even the most exotic settings and costars assume the depth of cardboard cutouts. Shot at the sumptuous Grandhotel Pupp in the Czech Republics Karlovy Vary and featuring Gerard Depardieu as a renowned master chef neither mammoth 300-year-old hotel nor mighty large famous French movie star are given roles of proportionate substance. Instead in her Queenliness the newly adventurous outspoken generous and fabulously dressed Georgia enchants everyone she encounters whether master chef hotel clerk or the up-to-no-good muckety-mucks she runs into in the lobby among them a junketeering U.S. senator (Giancarlo Esposito) a pliable congressman (Michael Nouri) and their host (Timothy Hutton) who also happens to be Georgias greedy conniving boss. All learn from her regal magnanimity as she teaches her rapt students to live life with gusto. In a lesson just about as profound Chef Depardieu suggests everyone ought to use more butter.

Queen Latifah appealing performance and overall feel-good vibe could attract diverse demographics and generate strong word of mouth during a potentially leggy theatrical run. Paramount may be selling slapstick and impudent sass in trailers and TV spots but ""Last Holiday"" is most successful when it is engaging not uproarious. Glossy amusement is an updated remake of a well-regarded 1950 Brit comedy-drama starring Alec Guinness improbably retrofitted as a star vehicle for Queen Latifah. Leads appealing performance and overall feel-good vibe could attract diverse demographics and generate strong word of mouth during a potentially leggy theatrical run. Original pic (scripted by J.B. Priestley) cast Guinness as George Bird a mousy salesman who doesnt begin to enjoy life until hes told he has just a few weeks to live. Diagnosed with a fatal illness he impulsively opts to spend his lifes savings on a ""last holiday"" at an expensive resort where hes mistaken for a wealthy wheeler-dealer. As he savors the unfamiliar pleasure of being treated with respect and attentiveness Bird gradually discovers that hes a much more interesting and adventurous fellow than he ever suspected. Scripters Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman recycle many of the same plot elements in their scenario for the Americanized remake. Georgia Bird (Latifah) is an introverted sales clerk in the cookware department of an upscale New Orleans department store. She dreams of being a successful chef although she never even allows herself to sample to exquisite cuisine she prepares in her kitchen at home. (Shes a chronic weight watcher whos stifled her appetite for fine food -- and presumably for life itself.) And she pines for a handsome co-worker (another amiable romantic turn by LL Cool J) who shes too shy to actually romance. Much like her semi-namesake in the original pic Georgia radically re-prioritizes when she gets seriously bad news from her doctor. (Julia Lashae is fleetingly funny as a nastily caricatured HMO administrator.) Determined to enjoy every minute of her final weeks she books a flight to Karlovy Vary where she hopes to meet the legendary chef Didier (Gerard Depardieu) and pamper herself at a luxurious ski resort. Latifah deftly mutes her trademark verve in the opening reel of ""Last Holiday"" so that shes surprisingly credible as a woman too uptight and inhibited to even raise her voice in a church choir. (An elaborate production number during a Sunday service indicates that down the road pic might easily be transformed into a stage musical.) As Georgia gradually blossoms in her new environment director Wayne Wang encourages his leading lady to reveal more familiar aspects of her on-screen persona. Latifah effortlessly dominates every scene as Georgia hobnobs with vacationing congressmen (Giancarlo Esposito Michael Nouri) admires the kitchen magic of a bemused chef Didier and advises the under-appreciated mistress (Alicia Witt) of a snide retail tycoon (Timothy Hutton) who just happens to own the department store where Georgia worked in New Orleans. Despite the undeniable appeal of pics underlying ""Live for today"" theme ""Last Holiday"" takes a bit too long to cover familiar territory en route to a predictable destination. (Its not at all surprising that the remake eschews Priestleys audacious ending.) Some of the more elaborate funny business is at best uneven. A frenetic ski-and-snowboard race down a steep hillside goes on too long and relies too heavily on unconvincing stunt doubles. Even so Latifah ensures that ""Last Holiday"" is often very charming and never less than pleasant. She and Depardieu establish a mildly flirtatious give-and-take that is quite delightful -- so much so in fact that you may wish their characters had gotten even closer. Among the other supporting players Witt Ranjit Chowdhry (as Georgias doctor) and Susan Kellermann (as a snooty hotel employee) are stand-outs. Sequences filmed on location in New Orleans prior to the devastation of Hurricane Katrina may bring a sense of melancholy nostalgia to some viewers. In the same vein a scene in which Georgia chides a Louisiana senator for not paying enough attention to ""community re-development"" may have an impact that the filmmakers could not have predicted. Tech credits are mostly impressive though lensing occasionally is unaccountably drab. Last HolidayProductionA Paramount Pictures release and presentation of an ImageMovers/Laurence Mark production.
