Here Julia Stiles leads what is essentially an adaptation of Wills 148th sonnet which Paige reads in her college literature pre-req O cunning Love With tears thou keepst me blind/Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find. Go-getter Paige finds plenty of foul faults in Eddie (Luke Mably) a preening metrosexual newcomer to the University of Wisconsin but not only does he prove himself an ace Bardic tutor he happens to be Danish royalty (like the protagonist of a certain Shakespeare play whom Paige describes as a total loser) gone AWOL from his official duties for the frolics of the American collegiate heartland. Coolidges movie is a feminist-leaning fairy-tale refreshingly centred on a driven young woman in no need of rescue from any dungeon or drudgery and Stiles confidently embodies a resourceful workaholic who for the first time in her life finds her ambitions in conflict with her emotions.

The movie also offers a healthy dose of female empowerment. But even its pre-teen audience could use a bit more quirkiness and a little less formula. Luke Mably and Julia Stiles are an unlikely yet likable couple. Paramount The Prince amp; Me has the right messages about following your dreams and pursuing your ambitions as well as giving us a likable down-to-earth heroine in pre-med student Paige Morgan (Julia Stiles). It would seem that Danish prince Edvard (Luke Mably) would be her polar opposite. Hes bored directionless and cocky. But the two meet cute (a necessary ingredient of any romantic comedy) and are drawn to each other despite Paiges initial antipathy. Back in the old country Edvard watches a ridiculous TV segment about girls of the American heartland and imagines that all of them are corn-fed beauties willing to strip at a moments notice. The impetuous type he hops on a plane and enrolls at the University of Wisconsin. Once there he waltzes into a bar and after several drinks asks bartender Paige to take off her top. ABOUT THE MOVIE The Prince amp; Me   1/2 (out of four) Stars Julia Stiles Luke Mably Miranda Richardson Director Martha Coolidge Distributor Paramount Pictures Rating PG for some sex-related material and language Opens Friday nationwide Moments like that and a few other racy scenes make one question the movies PG rating. In one scene set in the library stacks a couple heatedly peels off their tops to commence a tryst -- until authorities interrupt. Theres also a reference by one of Paiges friends to sleeping with a 45-year-old man while on vacation in Italy. Its not germane to the plot and seems inappropriate for a young audience. Other than those moments the movie is escapist fun. Once Edvard apologizes for his bad behavior and he and Paige become unwitting lab partners chemistry overtakes them. Edvard is not a bad guy and Paige must struggle with her dream of becoming a doctor as their romance turns more serious. Stiles has an appealing Everygirl quality with better-than-average comic timing and appreciable smarts -- a combination that makes a ho-hum character worth rooting for. One wishes the screenplay had provided more laughs fewer extraneous suggestive moments and a less predictable ending.

In Martha Coolidges ""The Prince amp; Me"" Luke Mably plays a disguised prince on vacation in Wisconsin who falls in love with commoner Julia Stiles and ... well my apologies to fans of Stiles Mably and the Dairy State but it doesnt turn out quite so well. Its not really the actors fault though -- surely even Hepburn herself couldnt sell this movies city-slicker-on-the-farm milking scene or its endlessly dragged-out lawnmower race. (Yes such things really do exist in the heartland apparently. Remember every movie has something to teach us.) Despite the obvious plot similarities its not quite fair to compare the two movies ""Roman Holiday"" was made for grown-ups and ""The Prince amp; Me"" though its main characters are in their early 20s is clearly aimed at a much younger audience. Stiles is Paige Morgan a hardworking nice girl whose parents own a dairy farm whos approaching graduation at the University of Wisconsin and keeps her eyes firmly focused on her goal of being a doctor. Mably is Prince Edvard of Denmark a roguish playboy whos come to the Midwest in the hopes of finding college girls willing to take off their tops. Movie review Showtimes and trailers  ""The Prince amp; Me"" with Julia Stiles Luke Mably Ben Miller James Fox Miranda Richardson. Directed by Martha Coolidge from a screenplay by Jack Amiel Michael Begler and Katherine Fugate. 107 minutes. Rated PG for some sex-related material and language. Several theaters. Girl meets boy girl initially hates boy girl learns to love boy girl makes out with boy in library stacks only to be interrupted by paparazzi from whom she learns truth about boy ... hey is there any popcorn left? Please? ""The Prince amp; Me"" certainly isnt unwatchable but it suffers from problematic casting. Stiles seems out of place in this kind of fluff. With her deep almost gruff voice and formal manner shes believable as a smart girl but doesnt project enough warmth to draw us in. (The fact that shes written as a bit of a pill always blathering about her life plan and her med-school applications doesnt help.) Mably a Brit has a nice sort of princely sheepishness about him (think Charles Andrew and Edward -- at times they practically bleat) but hes also a very cool performer; you dont quite buy the heat he and Paige are supposed to be generating. Ultimately its yet another well-meaning story about following both your heart and your dream occasionally sweet yet overly familiar and overlong. We still watch ""Roman Holiday"" 50 years after its debut; somehow I doubt that ""The Prince amp; Me"" will be remembered for very long.

(AP Photo/Isabella Vosmikova) Julia Stiles as Paige and Luke Mably as Eddie share a dance in amp;quo;The Prince amp; Me.amp;quo; Photo ISABELLA VOSMIKOVA Pre-med student Danish prince get sweet -- smart remake tells it from her point of view 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Prince amp; Me Romantic comedy. Starring Julia Stiles and Luke Mably. Directed by Martha Coolidge. (PG. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""The Prince amp; Me"" is a feminist re-imagining of ""The Student Prince"" with the story told from the womans standpoint. The movie doesnt acknowledge this and its intended audience of young people wont catch the reference but the main elements are there A prince goes to college  falls in love with a barmaid and then carefree youth ends when the young man has to assume the reins of government. The simple act of telling the story through the womans eyes changes the nature of the tale in interesting ways and for the most part the update is honest and illuminating. The casting of Julia Stiles as a brainy college student working part time as a barmaid and with ambitions to become a doctor is a big plus. Stiles seems just as smart and single-minded as the woman she plays. And Luke Mably is every Americans picture of a young prince. With his broad shoulders and gangly body he looks like one of those sandy-haired small-headed Windsor boys. But probably the best thing about ""The Prince amp; Me"" is the way the story doesnt end in the obvious place but keeps going showing the characters continuing to develop. Unlike most Hollywood movies especially one aimed at young people it tells its story in four movements not the usual three. The only bad thing is that when it finally does find its way to a satisfying conclusion it doesnt stop there either but tags on a little epilogue that lends a note of absurdity and compromise to its intended message. Still teenage girls will probably find a lot of enjoyment and encouragement in this story. Stiles is Paige a pre-med student who grew up on a dairy farm in Wisconsin and Mably is Edward the Crown Prince of Denmark. Edward decides to spend a year going to college in Wisconsin after seeing one of those videos of drunken American college girls taking off their shirts for the camera. Accordingly when he meets Paige at the local pub he asks ""Will you take your top off for me?"" and she squirts him with a seltzer gun. Edwards immediate and exclusive interest in Paige is never accounted for just something the audience has to accept. Though he went to Wisconsin looking for adventure with a certain kind of American girl his focus narrows to Paige whos the complete opposite of a bar bimbo. He arranges his schedule around hers and becomes her lab partner in her organic chemistry class. For the first time in his life he sets about winning the admiration of a woman who has no idea hes a prince. He seems to lose his heart to her completely one night when he sees her dance to the jukebox as she cleans off tables. Considering how Stiles dances it must be love indeed because even director Martha Coolidges careful cutting cant disguise the fact that Stiles has all the natural rhythm of Peter Boyle in ""Young Frankenstein."" ""The Prince amp; Me"" is as pleasant to watch as a fairy tale but its smarter than a fairy tale. When the story shifts to the royal court in Copenhagen we see it all through Paiges eyes. At first its awe-inspiring and then its just reality a mixture of the glorious and the monotonous. The film is realistic about the demands of royalty and the fact that in a royal context being a genial galumphing American isnt always enough that individualism in a royal can be seen as a form of insolence or at the very least childish self-indulgence. The script doesnt ever tell us how we should feel about the royal life but we get the idea when Coolidge indulges in a little fun re-creating a set- up from ""The Godfather."" Paige is shown looking from outside into a dark room where her man is engaged is some business conference of which she knows nothing -- and then the door closes on her. -- Advisory A fairly chaste film with only one scene of lust thats interrupted before anything happens.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

The short answer in The Prince amp; Me is not on your life bub this is the U.S. of A. so screw your lazy European royalty But the longer answer is more complicated - and confusing. The ""me"" in this naive wish-fulfillment fantasy of surface charm (directed by Martha Coolidge) is Paige Morgan (Julia Stiles) premed major at the University of Wisconsin and a sterling specimen of American collegiate loveliness. Stiles who recently employed her reliable persona of studious/pretty girl in ""Mona Lisa Smile"" once again plays a student of a certain seriousness of purpose who works part-time as a barmaid at the local sudserie but carries herself with the self-contained aplomb of a visiting dignitary. The ""prince"" of the title is Edvard (British import Luke Mably who has a hint of Josh Lucas around the eyes) a directionless playboy in line for the Danish throne much to the worry of his parents the king (James Fox) and queen (Miranda Richardson). Planning to goof off in pursuit of easy Midwestern coeds he enrolls at Wisconsin styles himself as just plain Eddie meets Paige and falls in love. His good luck Eddie learns from Paige that working hard the American way builds character that egalitarian family life beats the yes-man ministrations of a long-suffering valet (Ben Miller) and that America actually has tons to teach all of Europe if only the stuffy old continent would listen and stop showing off about its culture history and jewelry collection. As happens in classic fairy tales the prince asks Paige to marry him and become his princess. But as happens all too frequently in modern versions Paige isnt allowed to choose one solution (love wins out over career and easy access to Wisconsin relatives) or the other (career and home needs require the sacrifice of fairy-tale love) and stick with it lest proponents of the other choice feel alienated; in a series of endings she and the audience are falsely promised that she can have it all. In other words ""The Prince amp; Me"" is committed to the controversial American policy of No Fantasy Left Behind.

Totally cliched and nearly two hours long pic takes forever to get to hopelessly obvious places -- which even the supposedly indiscriminate teen girl target audience is likely to detect. The old ""Roman Holiday"" premise gets yet another run-through in ""The Prince amp; Me"" a bland not particularly heartfelt romantic fantasy about a Danish prince who decides to live among the common folk for a while. Totally cliched and nearly two hours long pic takes forever to get to hopelessly obvious places -- which even the supposedly indiscriminate teen girl target audience is likely to detect. Despite some (but not enough) charming moments along the way this ""Prince"" doesnt look to hold court in cinemas for very long before taking up residence on cable and home video. Written by Jack Amiel Michael Begler and Katherine Fugate (the first two of whom hail from TV sitcom writing) and based on a story co-written by Mark Amin and Fugate pic opens in Denmark. Twentysomething Prince Edvard (Luke Mably) is next in line to succeed to the throne of the worlds longest continuous monarchy (the only one were told that still demands the kings active participation in the rule of government) but Edvards interests lie elsewhere. Edvard has a penchant for drag-racing his suped-up BMW through the streets of Copenhagen (though his opponents always let him win) and for fantasizing about the loose American college girls he sees on a ""Girls Gone Wild""-style TV program. Meanwhile back on the farm Midwestern coed Paige Morgan (Julia Stiles) prepares for another year as a pre-med student at the U. of Wisconsin keenly aware that shes the only one of her circle whos not married or engaged. Hoping for some time off from his princely responsibilities Edvard asks his parents the King (James Fox) and Queen (Miranda Richardson) for time off to ""study"" in America. They agree provided Edvards personal secretary Soren (Ben Miller) accompanies him. Naturally they choose Wisconsin as a destination and its only a matter of time before Edvard (now calling himself ""Eddie"") and Paige (the ""Me"" of pics title) meet-cute in the campus watering hole where she works part-time as a barmaid. (Curiously for a PG-rated pic ""The Prince amp; Me"" shows little reserve in depicting barely drinking-age college students consuming alcohol.) Eddie carefully unbuttons his shirt collar before strutting over to Paige. She takes one listen to his lewd pass tells him off with her mahogany voice raising those carefully arched eyebrows of hers and has him promptly thrown out of the bar. But they end up chemistry lab partners and soon discover theres more chemistry between them than just the classroom variety. He tutors her on Shakespeare she teaches him how to do his own laundry etc. all building up to those inevitable moments where Eddies true identity is revealed Paige acts betrayed and then they kiss and make up. Predictability of the material is a shame as director Martha Coolidge can be an inspired lyrical filmmaker with a warm feeling toward people given the right material (""Rambling Rose"" ""Introducing Dorothy Dandridge""). Here however her talent shows through in just one scene when Paige takes Eddie home to meet her parents an interlude shot on a real working dairy farm. Beyond that ""The Prince amp; Me"" seems to be on autopilot only finally springing to some life in its very final moments when Paige travels back to Denmark with Eddie/Edvard. Paige is torn between her med-school dream and the fairytale possibility of becoming princess of Denmark. That conflict holds some interest in an age when the political agenda dictates that young women not be forced into making choices between a career and domesticity. Stiles whos had a run of good parts in a diverse range of mainstream and indie pictures is irrepressibly engaging and she looks downright radiant in the series of elaborate gowns she gets to wear in pics third act. Her role however is of the undemanding sort more commonly tailored to the likes of Hillary Duff or Amanda Bynes and therefore a strange career choice for Stiles. Mably is asked to do little other than look suitably princely but Miller has some scene-stealing moments in a role that occasionally recalls those memorably put-upon sidekicks played by Arsenio Hall in ""Coming to America"" and John Gielgud in ""Arthur."" Tech achievements for this runaway production (filmed in Toronto and Prague) are as by-the-numbers as pic itself with Alex Nepomniaschys flat TV-style lensing a far cry from his edgy work on Joe Carnahans ""Narc.""
