Comments Johnson Family Vacation Cedric the Entertainer takes the Chevy Chase role in this lame knockoff of National Lampoons Vacation playing an uptight insurance salesman driving his lippy wife and kids from Los Angeles to Missouri for a family reunion. Theres one killer gag after Cedric flings his sons Tupac and Biggie CDs out the window on the grounds that he wont listen to any music by people who were shot the kid retaliates by tossing out dads Sam Cooke and Marvin Gaye discs. Otherwise this is a real mess with out-of-focus shots and continuity lapses that suggest a production in chaos. Christopher Erskin makes his directing debut; with Vanessa Williams and Steve Harvey.

Thats the only reason I can fathom for such a wheezing contraption which strands Cedric the Entertainer behind the wheel and forces him to motor a collection of laugh-and-learn wacky situations by sheer force of his outsize charm. And in this traffic jam even that charm doesnt cover the cost of gas and tolls. As stuffy middle-class burgher Nate Johnson C the E loads up a Lincoln Navigator with his on-the-outs wife (Vanessa Williams) and a trio of sulking kids for a California-to-Missouri run to the annual family reunion. Mayhem includes a misunderstanding in a hot tub and the use of a soda cup for on-the-road urination with disastrous consequences for the next thirsty person. Minor repair arrives in the person of Steve Harvey who offers hectic riffs with his old partner in the role of Nates outlandishly competitive older brother.

Occasional laughs and a pleasant tone should yield modest returns but given the talent this vacation is less than it could have been. No one from National Lampoon was harmed in the borrowing of their well-worn comedy franchise to concoct ""Johnson Family Vacation"" an African-American road trip that mostly squanders some very gifted performers. Guided by a slapdash script this vehicle for Cedric the Entertainer is tantamount to embarking on a cross-country journey without a map making the ride predictably uneven. Occasional laughs and a generally pleasant tone should yield modest box office returns but given the heavyweight talent (no pun intended) this vacation is considerably less than it could or should have been. In that sense pic leaves unanswered whether Cedric can actually carry a movie after shining in his small ""Barbershop"" role and shorter-form fare -- from a Fox sketch comedy show to his too-good-to-zap beer commercials. What little humor the film musters in fact is almost wholly attributable to his appeal. The all-too-simple premise has Los Angeles resident Nate Johnson (Cedric) corralling his wife Dorothy (Vanessa Williams) and three kids for a trip home to Missouri. Once there he intends to vie with ultra-competitive older brother Mack (fellow ""The Original Kings of Comedy"" alumnus Steve Harvey in what amounts to an extended cameo) for the ""family of the year"" trophy -- something Nate covets and his sibling regularly pockets. The big secret is that Nate and Dorothy have separated though considerably less hidden is the fact that their joint trek will help bring them together however unconvincingly. As for the kids rapper Bow Wow doesnt have to reach much in the role of a wannabe rapper while Solange Knowles is nearly as dazzling as big sister Beyonce and does little more than smile winningly in her first bigscreen outing. Both commercial director Christopher Erskin and writers Earl Richey Jones and Todd R. Jones (real-life brothers with various TV credits) are making their feature debuts as well and the lack of a steadying hand shows. Admittedly episodic by nature the film nevertheless gives Cedric too little to work with and doesnt possess a strong enough through-line to completely sell the adventure as a bonding experience. Whats left to like then comes in the form of well-spaced moments. Nate gets stranded in a hot tub grows tired after running about five feet and zooms past a nun in need of roadside assistance only to pick up a comely hitchhiker played by ""American Pie"" babe Shannon Elizabeth. Even that latter sequence however reveals some of the pics miscalculations as Nate drools over Elizabeth (who has the good sense to realize what she contributes to a marquee) in front of his kids. A second role for Cedric as the lascivious fast-talking Uncle Earl also falls flat. Equally unseemly is Nates juvenile relationship with his brother as they jockey for their mothers approval which should have audience members feeling about as fidgety as the extended family appears to be. The whole scenario seemingly exists for no reason other than to provide an excuse for a high-spirited family song-and-dance number that comes as too little too late. Although its usually best not to put much stock in production notes within them Cedric characterizes the movie as being ""not too crass or over-the-top but with a really good energy"" which is generally true. Now if someone had just remembered to pack the laughs this might have been a trip worth taking.

Just dont expect the film to add anything to the time-worn vacation-from-hell genre. (Related video See a clip from Johnson Family Vacation) (L-R) Vanessa Williams Cedric The Entertainer Solange Knowles Bow Wow and Gabby Soleil star in Johnson Family Vacation. Casting Cedric the Entertainer in the lead would seem inspired; he was the highlight of both Barbershop movies. But in Johnson Family Vacation he hasnt been given much of a script to work with. Cedric plays Nate Johnson a Los Angeles insurance salesman who is hellbent on getting to Missouri for his extended familys reunion spurred on by a rivalry with his smug brother (Steve Harvey). Nates estranged wife (a lackluster Vanessa L. Williams) is going along only for the sake of the children seething with resentment over Nates inability to accept her desire for a career as an accountant. Their youngest child is an adorable tyke (Gabby Soleil) with an imaginary dog thats hard to keep track of; their teen son is a wannabe rapper (played by real-life rap artist Bow Wow); and their fashionista teenage daughter (Solange Knowles) would rather be at the mall than on the road to Missouri. Of course the trip goes off course in myriad ways. Nearly every problem is based on Nates almost pathological foolhardiness He plays chicken with the driver of an 18-wheeler. He also picks up a dubious-looking hitchhiker who nearly turns the movie into a horror flick. When hes not behind the wheel of his ridiculously souped-up SUV Nate tries to sweet-talk his estranged wife into romance but that fails miserably too. Once the Johnsons weather all the obstacles things go from silly to sappy. Somehow the three kids and parents pull off a professionally choreographed song-and-dance routine (without even the slightest discussion much less rehearsal) and dazzle Nates tough-to-please mom and the rest of the relatives. The ending is more sticky-sweet than a pack of gummy bears. For the road-trip premise to work screenwriters have to come up with original twists. (Think Ben Stillers hilarious cross-country search for his birth parents in Flirting with Disaster.) Too bad first-time director Christopher Erskin who cut his teeth on music videos and commercials took so many predictable turns on this Vacation.

Long ride for family -- and the audience 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Johnson Family Vacation Comedy. Starring Cedric the Entertainer Vanessa Williams and Bow Wow. Directed by Christopher Erskin. (Rated PG-13 96 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Cedric the Entertainer is one of the most versatile comedians around with the unique ability to improvise characters who are obnoxious and endearing at the same time. So why force him into a straight-man role in a movie thats nearly a scene-for-scene rip-off of ""National Lampoons Summer Vacation"" -- where the only substantive change from the original is a reversed travel route? And once the mistake is made to rein in his humor why surround him with actors who have no comic timing of their own? These are the questions that plague ""Johnson Family Vacation"" a comedy with a couple of big laughs but many more missed opportunities. Cedric tries his hardest and the Entertainers heroics keep the movie from being truly awful. But poor direction and a script that borrows liberally from the UPN television sit-com playbook probably doomed this project from the start. Cedric stars as Nate Johnson an insurance salesman in a Southern California suburb who is about to travel across country with his estranged wife and three children for a family reunion. The movie begins with Johnson in an auto dealership with his son where he receives a mistake -- a 2004 SUV version of the Family Truckster that Clark Griswald piloted in the original ""Vacation."" Its the exact same beginning as that 1983 movie minus the humor. The reserved Johnson makes a sort-of-funny comment about his desire to install an eight-track tape player but mostly expresses sober anger about his new chromed-out set of wheels. Cedric goes through the movie like a thespian Barry Bonds with little to no protection in the lineup. As the Johnsons travel from California to Missouri Cedric is allowed to loosen up a bit but the supporting players dont give the comic much to work with. The kids who play his children -- including Bow Wow and Solange ""Beyonces sister"" Knowles -- seem cast purely for name value. Movie wife Vanessa Williams is an even bigger comic timing nightmare and shes had 15 years in the business. It doesnt help that her pairing with Cedrics Johnson is a distracting impossibility. Williams is much too hot for her real-life husband Rick Fox of the Lakers -- does anyone really believe shed father three children with a boring number cruncher whos built like Tommy Lasorda? While its easy to pile on the actors some of the responsibility must pass to the screenwriters who failed in the relatively easy task of ripping off a Chevy Chase movie. ""Johnson Family Vacation"" is mired in seen-it-before nonsense (Shannon Elizabeth is a hitch-hiker who shows a lot of cleavage And she has a pet alligator that bites Nate in the genitals) that doesnt even match the ingenuity of Cedrics beer commercials. Thankfully the humor picks up when the journey ends at the Johnson family reunion -- a sort of Wally World with sack races and barbecue. Steve Harvey is funnier than usual in a small role as Johnsons brother and Cedric borrows Eddie Murphys ""The Nutty Professor"" trick donning makeup and overalls to play the Klump-like tow truck driver Uncle Earl. ""Girl if you dont look like a hot cup of soup"" Earl says to Johnsons wife in a backwoods drawl. ""And Ive got the flu."" Perhaps the makers of ""Johnson Family Vacation"" should make an entire sequel based on Uncle Earl. (Oh wait someone already did. It was called ""Barbershop 2."") Or maybe next time they should rip off ""The Nutty Professor"" and let Cedric play the whole Johnson family with the unrestrained hilarity hes known for. It wouldnt be original but at least it would be funny. -- Advisory Contains sexual situations and adult language.

JOHNSON FAMILY VACATION Movie Review (2004) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/johnson-family-vacation-2004,200,johnsonfamilyvacation14,johnsonfamilyvacation,rogerebert
"Vacation takes detour to dullsville - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Vacation takes detour to dullsville By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  April 7 2004 By the time the Johnsons wind up onstage competing for ""best family"" honors at the end of ""Johnson Family Vacation"" the movie has long overstayed its welcome. Cedric the Entertainers name may be above the title of this boring mediocre movie but the familys brand-new souped-up Lincoln Navigator with its Sony PlayStation onboard navigation system and Burberry plaid interior is the real star. It and its coproducts are always well placed even as the filmmakers root around for the family and entertainment values.Nate and Dorothy Johnson (Cedric and Vanessa Williams) are separated but agree to drive with their three children from Los Angeles to Missouri for the Johnson family reunion just so Nates disapproving mother (Aloma Wright) wont think something is wrong with their marriage.Cedric is as charming and as easily chagrined as he is in his Bud Light spots. He even gets to reenact one this time with a flare and a Jacuzzi as props. ""Barbershop 2"" with its meatier part for Cedric demonstrated hes a better side order than a meal. In the meantime we get to see Williams give a less-committed performance than she does in her Radio Shack spots. Odd She can sell surge protectors and cheap headphones but she cant make me like a road-trip comedy. (Theres more than one shot of her dozing off in bed and in the passenger seat.)Williamss Dorothy has been studying to become a certified public accountant a dream that her husband apparently didnt support because he wanted her home. This is one of those iffy attempts at character development that seems ridiculous given the films casting The marriage should have ended years ago as Williams doesnt seem like someone who plays the ""yes dear"" game.On the other hand Cedric does. Each of Nates archetypal children has him wrapped around his or her finger. DJ (Bow Wow whos grown out of the ""Lil"") wants to be a rapper. Nikki (Solange Knowles Beyonces lil sis) is the boy-crazy skin flasher. The youngest child is named . . . Destiny. And the title of a hit by a similarly named group seems fitting here ""No No No."" Destiny is played by Gabby Soleil a tyke of such calculated child-actor sweetness that the movie could induce an outbreak of cavities. Cedric humors his children and disappoints us by not heaving one out of the SUV at each stop.Todd R. Jones and Earl Richey Joness script is full of nonevents such as the familys run-in with the pet alligator of a hitchhiker (Shannon Elizabeth); its attempts at gross-out humor are halfhearted; and the comedy is Teflon -- nothing sticks. A more inspired movie would have allowed Nikki a proper hissy fit after the familys luggage goes flying onto the interstate. But no one seems to notice they have no clean clothes.""Johnson Family Vacation"" has been made not according to whether the Johnsons seem like a family (they dont) but by which of its members youve come to see. Its stretched thin trying to bridge the vast comedy gap between Cedrics adult fans and the girls whove come for Knowles. Add first-timer Christopher Erskins listless arrhythmic direction and the result is a bore.Like a lot of people I dont really look forward to my own family reunions so a movie about people on their way to one should be more resonant than this. But the members of the extended Johnson family dont seem to love one another in any conventional way; they compete in contests and with expensive gifts to prove whose love is greater. In that sense Nate and his brother Mack (Steve Harvey) are the seeds of an August Wilson play. Otherwise the movie is blank on the nuances of family. Its sense of materialism is fine though When Mack carries a large flat-screen plasma television into his mommas house she knows exactly where it goes on the wall ""right between JFK and Jesus.""
