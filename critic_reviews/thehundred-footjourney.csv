"Small(er) Movies Roundup Frank The Giver and More << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Small(er) Movies Roundup Frank The Giver and More Movies August 19 2014 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Because not even the worst movie here is worse than Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Expendables 3. The Hundred-Foot Journey directed by Lasse Hallstrom Just appalling. A family of Mumbai asylum seekers settle in a French village. They open their funky soul-food restaurant right across the road from the snootiest joint in all the land. Om Puri runs the Indian place. Helen Mirren is his clenched Gallic rival. If the movie has to exist at all it ought to be a duel between these two actors -- her soupy accent versus his root vegetable of a nose. It is instead a tale of assimilation in which the talents of the old Indians son (Manish Dayal) become too much for the old Frenchy to resist. She must have him in her kitchen and inculcate him with the sort of national culinary traditions that will land him fame in Paris where a kind of Iron Chef-Modernist Cuisine hell awaits (the dust the foam the facial stubble). Theres a way in which the movies can make progress seem totally backward. The young man is all too happy to oblige having already won the local lovely (Charlotte Le Bon) who wears perfectly tailored floral-print dresses and rides the sort of cute basketed bike that non-French movies always put French women on. Of course she works in Madame Mirrens kitchen where her envy over her bosss preference for her new pal temporarily compromises their relationship. Hallstroms confusion of tastelessness with tastefulness strikes again. (Perhaps youve seen Chocolat or The Cider House Rules or Salmon Fishing in the Yemen.) Another instance comes in the idea that what boring-old French cooking needs is lots and lots of spices. But my favorite is the scene in which a shot of the Indians kitchen-wise matriarch burning alive in a politically ignited fire promptly gives way to a shot of sizzling shellfish. If the movie is high on gastronomy it also redefines cooking with gas. Mood Indigo directed by Michel Gondry How is it possible that weve given up on Gondry already? Is one bad blockbuster (2011s Green Hornet) all it takes? His last two films -- the dreamed-realist docudrama The We and the I and the realist-dreamed docu-toon Is the Man Who Is Tall Happy? -- came and went in the U.S. and the same fate appears to await this new movie a romantic dramedy. Its a crime. The first hour might be the loveliest youll see all year. Romain Duris and Audrey Tautou meet at a party. They dance fall in love get married and live happily until she gets sick. Sounds ordinary but this is the same man who made both literal and surreal Jim Carreys melancholy for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. He invented the civil agreement for moviegoing as community organization in Be Kind Rewind. He put a lot of Kylie Minogues on an ever-looping city block for her ""Come Into My World"" video. Here formal ingenuity and production design come at you so fast that to watch it is to be Lucy and Ethel at the chocolate factory stuffing candy into your pockets and inside your bra and down your throat. Duris and Tautou leap from his loft bed in pajamas and land on the floor fully dressed for the day. When Charlotte Le Bon (far better used than in The Hundred-Foot Journey) gets a load of Duriss friend and amanuensis (Omar Sy) she drops the tray she is holding and the camera cuts to her feet slipping on it cartoon-style until shes got the momentum to sail in his direction and attack him with kisses. But all the blisses of this movie wipe you out. The first hour is so happily innovative with its Richard Lester zip and the last half-hour so forlorn (the Jean-Paul Sartre sight gags arent a joke). Gondry has such an incomparable understanding of the way in which strange and unexpected sights can tickle you. What he sometimes lacks as a filmmaker is the awareness that he can tickle an audience to death. Magic in the Moonlight directed by Woody Allen Its possible Allen has solved the Emma Stone problem. It was pretty simple Hire her. Here shes Sophie Baker an American psychic residing among rich Yankees in late-1920s southern France. Is she a four-star clairvoyant or a two-bit gold digger? Who better to crack the case than the esteemed if conceited Orientalist stage magician Stanley Crawford (Colin Firth)? What happens here needs no clairvoyance. Firth is not as 25 as Stone is so theyre a match. But the movies opening hour has a fascinating balance of nonsense and depth. The buttery haze of Darius Khondjis photography goes nicely with Allens attempt to conflate Nietzsches human distrust and F. Scott Fitzgeralds class ladders with poetic writing. The more Sophie appears to be the real deal the deeper into spiritual doubt Stanleys arrogance sinks. If only Allen could keep that introspection and frippery going. Eileen Atkins Jacki Weaver Marcia Gay Harden and an elegantly spent Simon McBurney do fine work. And Stone doesnt overdo anything -- shes daffy and cunning. You dont know whether shes running a con. Actually yes you do. You just dont care. But the movie runs out of ideas for her character. Sophie and Stanley appear to be in a belief-oriented arm-wrestling match that you want her to win. But her character gets dumber and dumber the further from her gift she gets. If Allen thinks he has transferred that magic to the embarrassing last scene then he should be the object of Stanleys next debunking. The Giver directed by Phillip Noyce One risk of these dystopia series is that they start to run together. Lois Lowrys Giver novels the first of which showed up in 1993 are a recent forerunner of series like The Hunger Games and the delusionally self-defensively titled Divergent. But this adaptation arrives after those and sleepwalks in their shadow. Its hard to care that its special-chosen-gifted nonconformist hero Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) wants to restore painful memories to a utopia from which such truths have been erased. Thwaites and the kids playing his fellow classmates are like live-action Kohls catalogue models. Meryl Streep does some half-chilling insinuation as the head elder. Jeff Bridges in the venerated title role mumbles through another part. (Hes like a car radiator that needs water.) And the brief appearance of Taylor Swift is like an answer to clues in a game of charades blonde? Hallucinated? Plasmatic? Piano? The films been shot in dreary black-and-white. The primary mode of communication is ritualized passive-aggressiveness (""Thank you for childhood"" young graduates are told; and the mantra ""We accept your apology"" comes to sound like ""Up yours""). And the color montages of those erased memories feature all the brown people who arent actually part of the narrative. This might be an anti-pharmaceutical anti-cult (Katie Holmes aptly drones along as Jonass mom) anti-plot anti-suspense allegory. It could also just be Thanksgiving at your robot-zombie in-laws. Into the Storm directed by Steven Quale Ill say this for humanity. Its still strong enough that when this lazily conceived lousily acted painfully dumb movie gives you the option to root either for the computer-generated tornadoes or for the people exploiting them for fame and cash Ill still choose the people. But its not an easy choice. What weve got here is somewhere between Twister and one of those storm-chaser reality shows except Jan de Bont made Twister. That man knew how to make a comic-suspenseful set piece -- and Helen Hunt Bill Paxton and Philip Seymour Hoffman knew how to act. This movie uses that found-footage device in which none of the characters can ever put the camera down especially when running for his life. Even the brand-new Oklahoma high school lovebirds keep theirs running while the building theyre trapped in turns them into the kids from Titanic. Occasionally the gimmick vanishes and you have to wonder whos doing the camerawork and who has supplied the pseudo military-video-game home-screen music. Youre asked to wonder a lot actually. Why is saving the day the job of the vice-principal (Richard Armitage) and not the Obama-eared Updike-quoting hardheaded principal-principal? (No answer required.) And is the movie really gonna start a thing between the vice-principal and the guilty single-mother meteorologist (Sarah Wayne Callies)? Oh my god it is (Its preposterous to have Armitage wear his suit this wet and this tight if he wont rip it off and start catching falling barns.) The one beautiful image is of Veeps Matt Walsh defanged of comedy and his armored vehicle as its sucked into the eye of the storm. Then you remember theres only one direction left for him to go in and that even though hes playing the biggest asshole and most selfish moron its the wrong one. But barely. The Dog directed by Allison Berg and Frank Keraudren Theres a brashness to this documentary that sneaks up on you. In recounting the life of John Wojtowicz the Brooklyn guy whose all-day all-night 1972 bank robbery was the basis for Sidney Lumets Dog Day Afternoon the film gets personalities of a New York vintage that have gone out of style. Wojtowicz who died in 2006 is as they say a character. But so are the woman and men he married. So is his mother. Old and flabby and gray when the filmmakers find him he loves their attention. And they indulge him letting him surf jovial tirades about how he was a ""chauvinistic pig"" and ""the boss"" and a real ""motherfucker"" and the ""gay Babe Ruth."" But the movie always has its eye on a bigger story of sex and sexuality never losing the thread of Wojtowiczs megalomania narcissism and libidinousness. The robbery was for money to fund a sex reassignment surgery for Wojtowiczs wife Elizabeth Eden. But the marriage seemed doomed during the wedding when Wojtowicz tried to make out with everyone in sight. Berg and Keraudren have done reporting and research. Theyve found archival video and audio footage as good as Lumets film and in some instances far more illuminating. They tell the story of mental illness sexual politics homophobia and personal profit. Even with the social legal and political advances of the past 40 or so years what blew minds about and drew crowds to Wojtowiczs particularly yet peculiarly American story in the 1970s only seems slightly less bizarre now. A Will for the Woods directed by Amy Browne Tony Hale Jeremy Kaplan and Brian Wilson Another documentary that ends with a plea to visit a website -- in this case to find out more about so-called green burial. You roll your eyes only because the movie itself opens into an eloquent enough sales pitch on behalf of its primary human subject Clark Wang. Wang is a North Carolina musician and psychiatrist who has terminal cancer. Upon his death hed like to be buried au naturel -- no preservatives no fancy coffin. A wood box in the dirt will do. The movie feels entirely promotional provoking separate unanswered questions about green medicine too. Natural burials supporters want a normal process of decay in which the body enters the earth chemical-free. But Wang fights for his life and that requires lots of machines and treatments and cross-country driving. Im sure theres a rationale the natural-burial people could articulate but the filmmakers arent journalists enough to ask. They do have a sense of serenity and in Wang a persuasive movingly all-too-human case for the cause. Why bother with a URL when youve got this? Jealousy directed by Philippe Garrel Theres only one way to run in Garrels movies passionately. I mean that physically -- at some point Anna Mouglalis abruptly bursts out of a cafe and barrels down the street. Who at first can say why? Its an instinct. But the running is true emotionally too. The characters in Garrels umpteenth romantic drama run passionately but theyre cool. Mouglalis plays an actress who hasnt worked in years. She does odd jobs when she does anything at all. Her relationship with another actor (Garrels son Louis) seems to satisfy and exasperate her at the same time. But despite a dalliance with a cast mate he finds the idea of life without her impossible. The films 77 minutes shot in an autumnal woolly Bergmanesque black-and-white watch them do nothing much -- alone together or her with friends or him with his young daughter and other actors. Theres a casualness at work here thats absorbing because Garrel doesnt make a moment mean more than it ought to. So much of being in a relationship is spent in idleness on standby being slumped over the other person ostensibly doing nothing but being bound. For Garrels character that bond is sustenance (few actors are as all in as Garrell can be). For Mouglaliss the bond is something to toy with. Hers is the voice of a woman whose first words were ""Do you have a light?"" Here Mouglalis moves so casually from blase to neurotic that you question her employment status. She hasnt worked in so long because she has turned love into theater. Dinosaur 13 directed by Todd Douglas Miller In 1990 a group of American paleontologists discovered Sue the most complete T. rex fossil ever. They just happened to do so on land whose ownership was in dispute. This documentary works hard to be a custody drama among the scientists the federal government and an old South Dakota rancher with a complicated legal claim to what turns out to be Sioux land. It gets most of the way there. The story itself is so strange and the case so baffling. Theres no filmmaking to speak of just a collection of talking heads not enough of which belong to the government or the rancher. The storytelling raises more logistical and legal questions than its equipped to answer. But what Miller does have for anyone unfamiliar with Sues fate is a story with a suspenseful climax and at the very least a determination to tell it decently enough to leave the audience happy for the dinosaur and sad for the men and women who dug her up. Frank directed by Lenny Abrahamson Magnolia Pictures The reason rock dramas are usually so bad is that they dont know where in the band to find the story. Is it with the musicians the creation of the songs their performance? Very few movies supply the answer. Instead they give you poses and tics. This tedious movie does that as well. Domhnall Gleason winds up in a band with Maggie Gyllenhaal Scoot McNairy and Michael Fassbender who as Frank spends the movie in a disproportionally large papier-mache head presenting an aggravating affront to the sport of losing oneself in Fassbenders face. Its based on the story of the comic and musician Chris Sievey who spent some of his career in a similar head as Frank Sidebottom. Things go from cutesy to clever to grim from the bands country shack to the road and it takes too long to get everywhere. The songs meanwhile are knowing nonsense but they dont point to any larger idea about nonsense songs making you wonder if the band really knows. Theyre what in Infinite Jest would be called apres-garde. And it doesnt feel good to watch actors this good look this lost. All the irritation in Gyllenhaals performance and the boyish bafflement in McNairys appear to arise from the possibility that none of the actors -- except Fassbender who by the films insultingly cheap last act is in a totally different movie -- knows what theyre doing. Its as if the director is made of papier-mache too.

So does the food. What more do you want in summer movie escapism? OK a ban on cultural stereotyping fewer cliches and a pace less conducive to napping. Still unlike the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles reboot The Hundred-Foot Journey is a time-waster that goes down easy. Based on Richard C. Morais 2010 bestseller the movie is set in a picturesque French village that only has room for one restaurant. That would be the Michelin-starred Le Saule Pleureur an elegant boite run by the widowed Madame Mallory (Mirren) with an iron hand and an outrageous Gallic accent. The Madame practically faints dead away when the newly arrived Kadam family led by a strict patriarch (the great Om Puri) decide to open an Indian restaurant Maison Mumbai only 100-feet across the street. Mon Dieu Those Indian spices and French sauces are soon at war with each other. Ditto the Madame and Papa. All of which leads after a few dollops of racial antagonism to love and harmony. Did I mention that Papa has a chef son Hassan (Manish Dayal) who falls for Madames sous chef Marguerite (Charlotte Le Bon)? Well he does. Hassan ends up training with Madame a process that works so well that he moves up and out to become the culinary toast of Paris and an arrogant prick. The heavy plot sauce weighs down the movie. Director Lasse Hallstrom had similar buoyancy problems in 2000s bewilderingly Oscar-nominated Chocolat. Here he lucks out big time with Mirren and Puri two pros who know how to lift an audience over plot hurdles and turn a merely digestable diversion into a treat. Linus Sandgrens camera caresses the cuisine like an ecstatic lover. It brought out the foodie in me. Dont Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox.

Hundred centers on two restaurants across the street from one another an Indian eatery headed up by Papa Kadam (Om Puri) and the Michelin-starred French restaurant Le Saule Pleureur which is overseen by Madame Mallory (Helen Mirren). By Peter Rainer Film critic August 8 2014 Save for later Saved The Hundred-Foot Journey stars Om Puri (l.) Manish Dayal (center) and Helen Mirren (r.). Francois Duhamel/DreamWorks II/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Comfort food doesnt always have to be food. Sometimes it can be a movie - especially if its a movie about food. ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" adapted by director Lasse Hallstrom and screenwriter Steven Knight from Richard Moraiss 2010 bestseller is I would imagine nobodys idea of a great film but it serves up the pleasures of the obvious. You know where this movie is headed every foot of the journey and thats the point the comfort. If only a few unforeseen byways had been part of the package.As the film opens a Mumbai family headed by patriarch widower Papa Kadam (the unfailingly marvelous Om Puri) flees violent unrest and eventually settles in the Midi-Pyrenees region of France. There the decision is made to open a restaurant the Maison Mumbai similar to the family-run eatery back home. The biggest obstacle to success Directly across the street - yes 100 feet across - is the Michelin-starred Le Saule Pleureur overseen by the widowed Madame Mallory (Helen Mirren at her most tight-faced) who suffers fools not gladly.When it looks as though the provincial villagers are willing to give spicy Indian cooking a go Madame sets out to sabotage Maison Mumbai buying out key ingredients in the local market and hitting up the restaurant with all manner of nuisance lawsuits. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time The fun here is that Papa gives as good as he gets. Hes every bit as stubborn as Madame which of course means that somewhere down the line they will become close. This is the kind of movie in which characters are instantly pegged. Mirrens Madame for example does not crack a smile once for the first hour of the film. This is a dead giveaway that she will be smiling a lot in the second hour. The 50 best movies of all time Video Trailer The Hundred-Foot Journey Monitor Movie Guide The soggy center of the film belongs to Papas son Hassan (Manish Dayal) a gifted Indian chef who is entranced with French cuisine and also with Madames pretty sous-chef Marguerite (Charlotte Le Bon).  When Madame hungry for a second Michelin star comes around to the unthinkable thought that Hassan just might be her ticket to greater glory a bit of competitive tension is infused. But not much. Hassan may whip up sumptuous dishes but as a character he could do with a lot more spice.The film touches on the ugly strain of racism in certain sectors of French society but not enough to turn feel-good into feel-bad. About the most distressing thing that happens in the film is that Madame before she overcomes her uppityness rejects Hassans peace offering of pigeon with truffles. Hallstrom who also directed ""Chocolat"" follows the foodie-cinema aesthetic by filming the dishes in a gleaming sumptuousness designed to make you famished. (Sidenote To the eternal question of whether one should see these food movies on an empty stomach or a full one I turned to a renowned restaurateur of my acquaintance and her answer came back ""Always eat dinner afterwards."")If these movies continue unabated - in just the past few months weve had ""Chef"" and ""Le Chef"" - we may see the return of Smell-O-Vision. I wish the movie werent quite so sappy about the spiritually redemptive powers of fine cuisine. Sometimes a meal is just a meal. Apparently according to this movie the secret to making a great French sauce is the love you must ""find in your heart."" By this token all the great chefs of the world must be saintly and super-nice. Theres also a lot of talk about how ""food is memories"" which I suppose is a step up from ""Soylent Green is people"" but hasnt anybody connected to this movie ever had indigestion?And all this love stuff about food contradicts Madames naked ambition in going after yet another Michelin star. Still speaking as a critic albeit a movie critic and not a food critic (the difference between the two is diminishing) its nice to feel wanted.

Sean Tepper The Globe and Mail Published Friday Aug. 08 2014 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Aug. 08 2014 847AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Lasse Hallstrom Written by Steven Knight Starring Helen Mirren Om Puri Manish Dayal Charlotte Le Bon Classification PG Country USA Language English If you do anything before going to see DreamWorks Studios latest movie The Hundred-Foot Journey make sure it involves eating a delectable three-course meal. Otherwise you may feel as if youre being subjected to two hours of mouth-watering lip-smacking torture as you and your empty stomach are forced to watch a non-stop barrage of beautifully prepared gourmet dishes from the confines of your seat (trust me popcorn and sour patch kids just wont cut it). Set in a small village in the south of France the Steven Spielberg- and Oprah Winfrey-produced movie follows the story of Hassan Kadam (Manish Dayal) a culinary protege who travels to France with his displaced Indian family in the hopes of settling down and opening an Indian restaurant in the French countryside. However when the Kadam family purchases property 30 metres away from a Michelin-starred French restaurant run by Madame Mallory (Helen Mirren) a heated clash between the two establishments and cultures ensues as Hassan begins to fall in love with classical French cuisine (and Madame Mallorys beautiful sous-chef Marguerite played by Canadas Charlotte Le Bon).Although the film is billed as a drama The Hundred-Foot Journey offers enough laugh-out-loud moments to appease rom-com fans. While Mirrens snobby uptight portrayal of Mallory delivers everything you would expect from the Academy Award-winning actress; Om Puris Papa Kadam steals the show as the familys stubborn yet sweet patriarch. The Hundred-Foot Journey also marks the Hollywood debut of Montreal-born actress Charlotte Le Bon whose portrayal of Marguerite is sweet and refreshing but at times feels underutilized.At its core The Hundred-Foot Journey is a movie about good food and one mans passion for cooking. Despite some pacing issues (the story goes from too slow to way too fast in the flip of a pancake) its still a satisfying alternative to the violent big-budget blockbusters that flood the silver screen every summer.

Usually I cant stand them. ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"" ""Chocolat"" ""The Cider House Rules"" and the soggy one-two slap of ""Safe Haven"" and ""Dear John"" - those are somebodys movies but theyre not mine. Stubbornly sentimental faithfully based on some book-club approved best-seller theyre painfully tasteful and strangely lifeless. Theyre shiny expensive tear-jerking machines. And ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" is the latest. The movie -- based on a novel and brought to the screen by the relentlessly uplifting Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey -- is the story of an Indian extended family that after some detours decides to settle (improbably) in a tiny French village and open a restaurant. Even more improbably the one space they pick is 100 feet across the road from a Michelin-starred temple to French food whose starchy proprietor is convinced that the opposite of ""classic cuisine"" is the undoubtedly classless curries being served within nose-wrinkling distance. And so let the snobbery -- and the inevitable competition for clients and respect -- begin. Helen Mirren is the French autocrat and the veteran Indian actor Om Puri is the immigrant patriarch; both act here of course with quiet economy. Handsome Manish Dayal plays his son and waifish Charlotte Le Bon plays her protegee; they are not at least technically Romeo-and-Juliet progeny although an awkward romance develops nonetheless. Thats predictable of course as is everything else -- some slight jousting between the two rival establishments a flash of violent racism (which Mirrens character quickly shows she will not be party to) and an eventual loosening of tensions. And then the inevitable studio-movie third act in which our innocent hero is lured away by the big city. (Which hypocritically is always seen as a place of shallowness dishonesty and temptation in Hollywood films - as if anyone would even be working in L.A. if they hadnt abandoned their ""authentic"" small towns as soon as they could.) Like the recent ""Chef"" and ""Le Chef"" theres a certain amount of food-porn photography here although Hallstrom being Hallstrom overdoes it. Far from being farm-fresh his vegetables look like carefully tweaked special-effects; theyre as absurdly large and heavily glistening as something in a Del Monte ad. Nor does the film gives us an idea of as that simple but invaluable book once called it the joy of cooking. There are any number of closeups of chefs sniffing things approvingly. But you see little of the sensuality of making meals let alone the actual process. (At least after watching ""Chef"" you felt as if you could throw together a decent Cubano.) For some stressed-out audiences ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" will definitely hit the spot. There isnt any sex or bad language. The young people are pretty and the old people are funny. And there are no sudden unpleasant surprises before everything ends happily. Its the movie version of comfort food. Except even in comfort food theres a difference between something made from scratch and something that comes out of a box. And ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" still tastes of powdered cheese. Ratings note The film contains some violence. The Hundred Foot Journey (PG) Disney (122 min.) Directed by Lasse Hallstrom. With Helen Mirren Om Puri.

"Hundred-Foot Journey The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; hundred-foot-journey-the ) Hundred-Foot Journey The (United States 2014) August 07 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli Theres something gentle charming and old-fashioned about The Hundred-Foot Journey a family-friendly motion picture from director Lasse Hallstrom based on the book by Richard C. Morais. A non-confrontational movie about the power of food and family The Hundred-Foot Journey makes good use of the considerable talents of its veteran leads Helen Mirren and Om Puri to represent the cultural and culinary differences that exist between India and France. The sweep of the movie isnt all placid; elements of romance and whimsy are counterbalanced by instances in which the ugliness of xenophobia emerges. Only toward the end when the narrative stumbles during an extended epilogue does the concoction crumble a bit. Director Hallstroms last great movie was probably The Cider House Rules which came out 15 years ago. In the interim he has made some low-key pleasant films (like An Unfinished Life and Salmon Fishing in the Yemen) and a couple of forgettable Nicholas Sparks adaptations (Dear John and Safe Haven). The Hundred-Foot Journey is vintage Hallstrom - genial and meditative focusing more on characters and emotions than an overcooked plot. The story is simple; the people inhabiting the movie make this worth seeing. Om Puri plays the patriarch of the Kadam family a group of six who have departed India and come to France to open a restaurant. He is accompanied by his three adult children Mukthar (Dillon Mitra) Mahira (Farzana Dua Elahe) and would-be chef Hassan (Manish Dayal). Hassan has great talent in the kitchen but the death of his mother haunts him. Papa decides that the best place to start this new life is in a abandoned building near the outskirts of a town in the south of France Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val. To him it seems to be a great place to open ""Maison Mumbai"" but his children point out a problem across the street is the highly respected restaurant of Le Saule Pleureur. The proprietress of this classical French establishment Madame Mallory (Helen Mirren) is not keen on competition. Not dissuaded Papa presses on. Meanwhile Hassan forms a quasi-romantic friendship with Marguerite (Charlotte Le Bon) one of Madame Mallorys sous chefs. Soon the two rival establishments are engaged in an all-out culinary wara| until things go too far. Hallstroms filmmaking techniques are straightforward - the images lensed by his cinematographer Linus Sandgren emphasize the beauty of the terrain creating an almost fairy tale locale. Although the movie is set in contemporary times (as evidenced by the presence of a cell phone early in the proceedings and modern equipment during the epilogue in Paris) it feels as if its taking place in the 70s or 80s. There are rotary phones people use bicycles or old cars for transportation and theres nary a computer to be found. For the most part the lifestyle in and around Saint-Antonin feels like its frozen in an earlier simpler era. Theres a sense that Hallstrom is attempting to develop the kind of food-saturated ambiance that has characterized films like Babettes Feast and Big Night. However although the various dishes are lovingly presented they dont reach into the stomach quite the way those earlier films did - although it wouldnt be entirely unexpected if some viewers expressed a desire for Indian cuisine for a post-movie repast. Theres also an interesting montage of shots in which Hallstrom uses the chopping and dicing of vegetables to represent skirmishes in the ongoing conflict between Maison Mumbai and Le Saule Pleureur. The Hundred-Foot Journey represents a pleasant diversion for those who have grown weary of traditional summer movie fare. The picture is about people and how they interact. There are no explosions or car chases. There are no sex scenes - only a few kisses and a little dancing. The movie is at times too sentimental and the storyline is neither original nor surprising but the production as a whole gains points for its unalloyed charm. This is one dish that has been cooked well enough to satisfy.

FRANCOIS DUHAMEL  BY MICHAEL SRAGOW / MOVIE CRITIC Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF The Hundred-Foot JourneyStarring Helen Mirren Om Puri Manish Dayal Charlotte Le Bon Directed by Lasse Hallstrom Rated PG for thematic elements some violence language and brief sensuality Running time 2 hours 2 minutes Playing In wide releaseThe quick hitThis film about Indian and Gallic cuisine merging in a French village fails to rise like a mango souffle but it does offer Helen Mirren squaring off against an acting equal Om Puri. Grade B- ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" ends up as a cross-cultural love feast between Madame Mallory (Helen Mirren) the owner-operator of a Michelin-starred restaurant in a quaint southern French village and Papa Kadam (Om Puri) who opens his family-run Indian restaurant right across the country road from her. But to get there one of Hollywoods screenwriters du jour Steven Knight (""Locke"") relies on conflicts as starkly drawn as a combat movies. Mallory wages war on the Kadams whether by buying up the items they need for their opening night menu or registering one complaint after another with the mayors office notably about their noise. Papa Kadam replies in kind sabotaging the traditional meal planned for a visiting government minister. This clash took up only a fourth of Richard C. Morais novel and Morais embedded it in a close nuanced rendering of Mallorys xenophobia insecurity and skewed noblesse oblige; it climaxed as she wrestled with her ledger sheet of a conscience. In the coarser and more external movie her chef de cuisine commits a criminal act which brings her to her senses. She declares that she believes in the France of ""liberty equality and fraternity"" not the France that sings about shedding ""the impure blood"" of foreigners in ""La Marseillaise."" In brisk ""Top Chef"" fashion she tells the offender ""Pack your knives and go."" Knight proves to be addicted to melodrama and its flip side schmaltz. (His much-lauded film as a writer-director ""Locke"" was a one-man melodrama set in the heros car with a slew of antagonists reached by phone.) In ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" Mallory crosses the road first to wash a racist slogan off the Kadams property and then to offer a position to Papas prize cook his son Hassan (Manish Dayal) - a genius in the making. But the film still relies on exaggerated antagonisms. Although Hassan bonds with Mallorys pretty sous chef Marguerite (Charlotte Le Bon) she suddenly gets her back up and sees him as competition. By the end you realize that without trumping up oppositions Knight cant dramatize anything. This movie goes limp in its final third when it must focus on Hassans ascendance to culinary stardom his development of an authentic aesthetic and his internal crisis about leaving his family for the City of Light. Roughly a decade ago director Lasse Hallstrom made a string of supple unpredictably entertaining movies (""An Unfinished Life"" with Robert Redford ""Casanova"" with Heath Ledger ""The Hoax"" with Richard Gere). They didnt win a fraction of the audience hell get with this crowd pleaser but they were rich in atmosphere and sophistication and their characters lingered in the memory. Except for his failure to overhaul the script Hallstrom does bring this film exquisite craft. His camera savors every morsel of Mallorys haute cuisine the Kadams gaudy sumptuous spreads and the eye-popping sci-fi concoctions cooked up by Hassan at an avant-garde ""molecular"" restaurant in Paris. Hallstroms views of Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val a town in the Midi-Pyrenees are just as sensually inviting. The colors reach out and envelop you. Most important Hallstrom frames the actors like an Impressionist portraitist - sometimes Renoir sometimes Degas. Le Bon is so naturally pert and bright-eyed that when she lights up with delight she can outshine Bastille Day fireworks. Until the script undercuts him Dayal masters the trick of using his characters smarts to make him seem more confident than he is even sexually. Hassan is an urban guy but Dayal and Hallstrom make him look completely at home with Marguerite picnicking by a green woodsy riverbank. Its a rare delight to watch Puri and Mirren play off each other - with an emphasis on the word ""play."" Puris broad face is like a relief map of discordant emotions. Other characters think Papa is totally in the moment because of his powerful immediate presence. But without winking at the audience Puri conveys that Papa beneath his banter is often thinking about how to barter a better deal. And without pleading for sympathy he also expresses that his late wifes presence is as tangible to him as her heirloom spices. (When he speaks to her spirit you know hes not just talking to himself.) Mirren lends Mallory a no-nonsense majesty. Her passion emerges in terse words and sharp gestures that pierce the air and leave it tingling. Mirrens wit and exactitude provide the perfect counterpoint to Puris boisterous musicality. Their unusual rapport makes you warm to the movie. These two master performers consistently react to each other with feeling and cunning. They both convey the trait that can bridge cultures with a single bound blazing irrefutable talent.

"The Hundred-Foot Journey follows its recipe to the letter - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review The Hundred-Foot Journey follows its recipe to the letter The Hundred Foot Journey Movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews The Hundred Foot Journey Starring Helen Mirren Manish Dayal Charlotte Le Bon and Om Puri. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews The Hundred Foot Journey Starring Helen Mirren Manish Dayal Charlotte Le Bon and Om Puri. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter Review The Hundred-Foot Journey is comfort food without the messy kitchen Unhurried and unworried ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" runs with the genial precision of the well-oiled machine. A sweet and unapologetic fairy tale for adults its story of cuisines and cultures in conflict has been polished to such a high sheen its hard to know whether to be impressed or disheartened. Or more likely both.Doing all that polishing is a group of consummate professionals including such heavyweights as Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey as two of the films producers. The veteran Lasse Hallstrom (""Chocolat"" ""The Cider House Rules"") directs multiple Oscar-winning composer A.R. Rahman did the soundtrack and Steven Knight whose expert scripts include ""Dirty Pretty Things"" and ""Locke"" has adapted Richard C. Morais bestselling novel. And when it comes to acting canny and accomplished veterans Helen Mirren and Om Puri are well-cast as competing restaurateurs Madame Mallory and Papa Kadam. Their establishments create such mouth-watering dishes lovingly photographed by Linus Sandgren seeing this film on an empty stomach is not recommended.It would be foolish to pretend the result of all these labors is not an effective entertainment with the unexpected advantage of a plot capable of the occasional surprise. But enjoyable as ""Hundred-Foot Journey"" can be its still possible to wish that its gloss was not quite so shiny that the film had more of the messy juices of life to it. Despite its shared interest in love and Indian food a companion piece to the marvelous ""The Lunchbox"" this is not. ""Hundred-Foot Journeys"" protagonist is not either of its stars but Hassan Kadam (Manish Dayal) Papa Kadams oldest son. From the moment we meet him as a boy in inevitably colorful Mumbai we know what it will take the movie two hours to acknowledge This is an individual with an exceptional culinary gift.

""I asked someone Do you really need this amount... When chef Floyd Cardoz arrived in France last year he knew hed spend most of his time cooking. What he didnt expect was a quest for the perfect Hollywood shot that would force him to roast a wild bird artfully stuffed with truffles ? 12 times. ""I asked someone Do you really need this amount... (Jenn Harris) Hassan learns about cooking in the family restaurant but political unrest in India leads to tragedy. Distraught Papa (the always-effective Puri) moves his five children (including eldest son Hassan) to Europe for a new start but deciding on a destination is not so easily done.After rejecting the U.K. because ""the vegetables in England have no soul no life"" the Kadams are tooling down a back road in France when fate as it often does takes a hand not once but several times.The familys ancient vehicle breaks down in the picturesque hamlet of Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val and who should be bicycling past but attractive Marguerite (Charlotte Le Bon). She treats the family to local produce so tasty that Papa decides on the spot to take over a defunct restaurant claiming that a spirit message from his late wife insisted ""brakes break for a reason"" Review The cooking looks good but story tastes so-so in Hundred-Foot Journey Handout MCT Madame Mallory (Helen Mirren) in ""The Hundred-Foot Journey."" Madame Mallory (Helen Mirren) in ""The Hundred-Foot Journey."" (Handout MCT) There is just one problem with Papas plan Saint-Antoine-Noble-Var happens to be Madame Mallorys town and she has the chauffeur-driven car to prove it.Madame Mallory owns Le Saule Pleureur the towns celebrated restaurant worthy of a hard-to-get star in the Michelin guidebook. Its the best place to eat in a 50-mile radius and its located exactly 100 feet across the road from Maison Mumbai the Kadams new establishment. ""The French dont eat Indian food"" one of his daughters patiently explains to the old man. ""They have food of their own.""Not helping matters is Madame Mallorys shall we say starchy temperament? Mirren has a lot of fun playing the snooty Madame prone to saying things like ""Who are zese people?"" with the proper amount of imperious hauteur. She is not happy about having Maison Mumbai across the road from her not happy at all.But if the adults are headed for war the younger folks have other things on their minds. Young Marguerite just happens to be the sous chef at Le Saule Pleureur and Hassan develops quite a passion for learning to cook the way the French do it. ""To survive here we have to adapt"" he says but is his father listening?The ultimate resolution to all these problems is not difficult to predict but what do you expect from a movie filled with French folks who speak English 24/7? On the other hand if there is room for romantic fantasy in your life this cinematic equivalent of comfort food goes down easy enough and its hard to begrudge it that.kenneth.turanlatimes.com------------The Hundred Foot JourneyMPAA rating PG for thematic elements some violence language and brief sensuality.Running time 2 hours 2 minutes.Playing In general release.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 352 a.m. EDT August 8 2014Hassan (MANISH DAYAL center) serves his father (OM PURI) Beef Bourguinon a la Hassan a classic French dish with an Indian twist as Madame Mallory (HELEN MIRREN) explains its significance to French chefs in a scene from ""The Hundred-Foot Journey.?""(Photo Francois Duhamel DreamWorks II)The Hundred-Foot Journey is a feel-good movie that takes place in what just might be the most picturesque village in all of France.But apart from the scenic location of Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val and the equally enthralling shots of Indian and French cuisine what remains is a pleasant if rather syrupy tale of clashing cultures ( 1/2 out of four; rated PG; opens Friday nationwide).Based on the novel by Richard C. Morais the tale is at its most entertaining and energetic when focused on the adversarial restaurateurs played by screen veterans Helen Mirren and Om Puri.After the Kadam familys Mumbai restaurant is destroyed in a fire widowed patriarch Papa (Puri) takes his five children to England. They spend a year in those damp environs until Papa uproots them again heading for a more temperate climate.Their van breaks down in the foothills of the Pyrenees so the family settles in a village where Papa buys a restaurant in need of much repair. He promptly dubs it Maison Mumbai.The catch is that theres a posh Michelin-starred restaurant across the street run by the formidable Madame Mallory (Mirren). The Madame and Papa are instantly at loggerheads. But from their first food fight -- metaphorically speaking -- audiences sense that the two gastronomic adversaries eventually will become pals. Nonetheless watching the charismatic duo stubbornly spar and sabotage one another is the highlight of the film given Mirrens prim characterization and Puris spot-on comic timing. There is also a subtle undercurrent of sadness in the pair that makes what comes after seem less forced.Not quite as effective is a slow-simmering romance between Mallorys lovely sous chef Marguerite (Charlotte Le Bon) and Papas handsome son Hassan (Manish Dayal) the inventive cook at Maison Mumbai.Everyone involved learns that good food need not be the result of a top-chef competition. You can love both tandoori chicken and boeuf bourguignon. And what comes as no surprise is that Indian spices can enliven even the most hallowed French cuisine.The underlying message of tolerance harmony and embracing ethnic diversity is resoundingly worthy. Its just too bad that bland predictability dogs this Hollywood-ized take on xenophobia. Even when outright racism rears its head the viciousness seems surprisingly defanged.USA TODAYThe latest movie reviewsUSA TODAYUSA TODAYs guide to summer moviesMadame Mallory goes from being a woman who looks down her nose at the colorful foreign family (whom she calls ""you people"") to a staunch cross-cultural supporter in record time. Audiences may cheer that trajectory but it unfolds unconvincingly.Then in the third act things become even less compelling. Hassan is a gifted cook -- and Dayal is an appealing actor -- but his overnight ascent to international acclaim takes the film off course.Director Lasse Hallstrom who also made 2000s much-loved Chocolat knows how to concoct a luscious mainstream foodie movie. Clearly it seemed delectable to powerhouse producers Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey. And Mirren and Puri have an intoxicating charm and grace that make this film worth savoring. The Hundred-Foot Journey is bathed in a delicious warm glow akin to a hot buttery croissant or a savory slice of naan. And the films first impression an infectious Bollywood-inspired soundtrack by Slumdog Millionaire composer A.R. Rahman portends something enchanting and vibrant. But the story is too familiar. Think of biting into a souffle expecting thrilling tastes that dont quite materialize.

"The Hundred-Foot Journey exists where the food is delicious and the sun always shines review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Hundred-Foot Journey exists where the food is delicious and the sun always shines review It must be wonderful to inhabit whatever marvellous planet Swedish filmmaker Lasse Hallstrom resides upon. Theres a return visit for the food-is-love confection The Hundred-Foot Journey.From left Om Puri Manish Dayal and Helen Mirren star in The Hundred-Foot Journey about competing restaurateurs in a French village.  (Francois Duhamel / THE ASSOCIATED PRESS)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Aug. 7 2014The Hundred-Foot JourneyStarring Helen Mirren Om Puri Manish Dayal and Charlotte Le Bon. Directed by Lasse Hallstrom. Opens Aug. 8 at GTA theatres. 122 minutes. PGIt must be wonderful to inhabit whatever planet Swedish filmmaker Lasse Hallstrom resides upon. It sure aint nasty ol planet Earth.Its a place -- lets call it Lassetopia -- where the sun always shines except for brief pauses when nurturing rain drops briefly kiss the ground.Article Continued BelowIts a realm where rarely is heard a discouraging word and any that trouble the ear are swiftly retracted as part of an enriching life lesson. Its a magical kingdom where when turmoil and tragedy strike wounds are swiftly healed and even the dead can continue to communicate with the living for that all-important task of imparting life wisdoms.Lassetopia in short is a place much like we find in The Hundred-Foot Journey an act of pure fantasy adapted from Richard Morais bestseller. Its actually set and filmed in the real village of Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val in southern France but any connection with reality is as faint as for such previous Lassetopia journeys as Chocolat Salmon Fishing in the Yemen and The Cider House Rules.And much like Chocolat the new film offers love and romance in two different enticements for the films delightful characters ably led by Helen Mirren Om Puri Manish Dayal and Canadas Charlotte Le Bon and also for the mouth-watering array of delectable dishes on display.This is cinematic comfort food for mainstream appetites which means you cant rule out possible Oscar attention. With production backing from Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey heavenly cinematography by Linus Sandgren (he makes sunbeams seem like candy) and a smile-widening score by Slumdog Millionares A.R. Rahman the skys the limit for this handsome snack.The only ingredient that seems out of place is screenwriter Steven Knight who typically bangs out dark and nasty street sagas like Dirty Pretty Things Eastern Promises and the recent Locke. One must assume that even Mr. Knight is not immune to the charms of a tasty bauble and a lovely paycheque.And it must be said that it goes down rather well although full enjoyment requires that all cynicism be left simmering on the back burner. The title refers to the distance both physical and mental (life lesson ahoy) between the Michelin-rated Le Saule Pleureur restaurant run by uptight Madame Mallory (Mirren) and the down-home Maison Mumbai bistro of the recently arrived and resolutely upbeat Kadam family escapees from the slums of India.The Kadams have come to France and to town by a combination of infinitely patient customs officials fortuitous brake failure on their jalopy and celestial whispers from a departed relation.Led by proud Papa (Puri) the Kadams wish only to delight the well-heeled inhabitants of Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val with lovingly crafted victuals from their homeland even if the locals prefer pigeon aux Truffes to tandoori goat. Madame Mallory is not amused and not above waging war against ""zees people"" who have dared intrude upon her turf.Kadam family chef Hassan (Dayal) works with a magical spice kit bequeathed him by his saintly mama while Madame Mallory barks orders at a large kitchen helmed by her comely sous chef Marguerite (Le Bon).Lets study the bill of fare my fellow diners. What do you think the odds are that Madame Mallory and Papa will get into a spicy but enriching stew that Hassan and Marguerite will sweetly caress the lips and that The Hundred-Foot Journey will leave no senses unsated and no bitter aftertaste?And for dessert a sweet reminder that even though Paris is one helluva town theres no place like home?For the answers to these questions look not at a menu but rather at an atlas of imaginary places on the page marked ""Lassetopia.""

Photo Credit MCT advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A fancy French restaurant and a humble Indian eatery do battle. Rated PG (mild language brief violence sensuality) BOTTOM LINE From the director of ""Chocolat"" comes this crowd-pleasing souffle. Mirrens icy matriarch is terrific even if the rest is mostly air. CAST Helen Mirren Manish Dayal Om Puri Charlotte Le Bon LENGTH 202 Hassan Kadam the hero of ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" was born to be a chef. As a kid in Mumbai he swooned over the scent of fresh urchin and he grew up to run his familys humble restaurant. His mother taught him how to use spices. ""Life"" she says ""has its own flavor."" What does that mean exactly? No matter -- it sounds poetic and makes for a nice moment so it goes in. That pretty much sums up how director Lasse Hallstrom concocts ""The Hundred-Foot Journey."" A lesser filmmaker might have ended up with a muddy stew but Hallstrom a Swede with a knack for pleasing the Middle American palate (""Whats Eating Gilbert Grape"" ""The Cider House Rules"") knows exactly what hes doing. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? For starters hes in safe territory. Hassan is a likable aspirant straight out of the smash hit ""Slumdog Millionaire"" (the two movies share a composer A.R. Rahman) and he shares Americas obsession with food. As the story progresses Hassan relocates to the picturesque French village Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val where his stubborn Papa (Om Puri) wants to build a restaurant. Fatefully just across the street (can you guess the distance?) sits Le Saule Pleureur a one-star Michelin gem run with a cast-iron fist by Madame Mallory (Helen Mirren perfect as always). Even if you havent seen Hallstroms ""Chocolat"" from 2000 you know where this is going. Hassan starts a forbidden romance with Mallorys staffer Marguerite (a charming Charlotte Le Bon) while the two restaurateurs do amusing battle at the green-market. Eventually a crisis will bring both ""families"" together. The acting is generally fine although this cast is like Scotch The older the better. Mirren is ice on two legs while Puri an Indian actor with a campfire warmth melts everyone around him. The story loses steam when Hassan leaves for the big city (the ""molecular gastronomy"" movement is depicted as sexy flashy and soulless) and the movies upbeat ending is about as reality-based as the one in Shakespeares ""As You Like It."" Overall its tough to grumble about such a sturdy and crowd-pleasing souffle. 055 MoviesThe Hundred-Foot Journey trailer PLOT A fancy French restaurant and a humble Indian eatery do battle. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING PG (mild language brief violence sensuality) CAST Helen Mirren Manish Dayal Om Puri Charlotte Le Bon LENGTH 202 BOTTOM LINE From the director of ""Chocolat"" comes this crowd-pleasing souffle.

It starts off as the story of an Indian family that emigrates to Europe after their Mumbai restaurant is torched during a political protest and their mother is killed. Their car breaks down in a rural postcard-perfect corner of France and they wind up taking over a decaying restaurant space across the street from a Michelin-anointed fine-dining establishment run by the stern stiff-upper-lip Madame Mallory (an impressively sour Helen Mirren). Much narrative hay is made of Madame Mallorys rivalry with Papa (the great Om Puri) the proud and scrappy patriarch of the Kadam family They spar over everything from building permits to vaccinated chickens to parking spots. But the films real protagonist is Hassan (Manish Dayal) the oldest Kadam son and the one whos inherited his late moms culinary gifts. He falls for Marguerite (Charlotte Le Bon) the fetching sous-chef across the street and as much as he covets her he covets the acceptance of the culture she represents more When he reads a French cookbook we hear her voice on the soundtrack. As he tries with her help to master the five sauces of French cuisine he does so with the passion of a man who wants to belong -- of the immigrant looking in who wants a seat at the table. But Hassan and Marguerites burgeoning romance is also a rivalry; she too after all wants to be a chef not just a symbolic vessel for the male protagonists dreams. The film goes in some surprising directions with this aspect of their relationship even as it continues to conflate the love of a woman with the acceptance of a culture. Writer Steven Knight (Dirty Pretty Things) has in the past demonstrated a flair for the way human desire expresses itself in unlikely ways and you can sense the film trying to give Marguerite some real humanity even as it goes along on its merry pre-programmed way. The Hundred-Foot Journey is at its best when it portrays the tension between immigrant generations -- the deep desire of the kids to fit in their occasional embarrassment at the sight of parents who show a little too much pride who refuse to bow their heads and integrate. Dads obstinate chest-thumping about his Indian roots is not for Hassan -- at least not at first. Hassan doesnt just want to cook murgh masala with cashews and cardamom however exquisite his familys recipe might be. He wants to prove himself in the arena of haute cuisine. He wants to belong to and conquer a new world. Oddly enough however the film never quite manages to make the various bits of obligatory poetry about food and passion sing. We get a lot of breathless proclamations that cooking is about soul (""You must find it in your heart and then bring that to your pots"" says Marguerite awkwardly) but theres a disconnect here perhaps an intentional one. We see a lot of Hassan cooking but Im not sure how often we actually see him eat -- until a deeply emotional moment in the films third act whose nature I wont give away here. Director Lasse Hallstrom whos become an old hand at this sort of thing with such films as The Cider House Rules Chocolat and Salmon Fishing in the Yemen knows his chemistry and sense of place. He and cinematographer Linus Sandgren give us amazing views of this little valley community so gorgeous its almost unreal. We see the town the way an outsider might see it as an unattainable bit of perfection its quaint loveliness both alluring and forbidding. But The Hundred-Foot Journey which was adapted from Richard C. Moraiss book wants to be about a lot more than a petty culture clash against scenic vistas. It tries to give us a more ambitious tale of Hassans rise through the ranks of the culinary world. Its the kind of thing that a novel might pull off effectively but cinematically it results in a narrative imbalance as the fussy particulars of the films first half give way to the broad sweep of years in the second. Ultimately what comes through most forcefully in The Hundred-Foot Journey is the longing of the immigrant the overwhelming push-pull between the need to belong and the need to assert ones own identity. That the film is set in France a country where the native culture presses hard raises the stakes in interesting ways We see how a genteel pride in the refinement and supremacy of ones own culture can easily be nudged into overt racism. The film doesnt dwell on these points -- its not here to agitate its here to comfort and cajole -- but the fact that it even allows them into its otherwise prim and cozy narrative gives it a welcome kick.

WSJs Joe Morgenstern reviews these two films on Lunch Break with Lee Hawkins. Photo DreamWorks Studios/""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Aug. 7 2014 239 p.m. ET 3 COMMENTS For all of its gastronomic cultural and occasionally political crosscurrents ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" boils down to comfort food. The secret isnt in the seasoning whether French or Indian but in the seasoned stars Helen Mirren and Om Puri who portray warring restaurateurs and in the romance of two young chefs--played by Manish Dayal and Charlotte Le Bon--who go mushrooming in the moonlight. (Since the setting is a picturesque village in the south of France the lovers are looking for cepes which would sound less romantic if they were called porcinis.) All foodie movies are afflicted by aphorisms and this one has its share ""To cook you must kill""; ""You cook to make ghosts""; ""The sea urchins taste of life."" But the folk-wisdom level is tolerable just as the cliches and manipulations are palatable because the story is full of life and free of ironic additives. More Reviews Deepsea Challenge 3D Into the Storm What If Watch a clip from the film ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" starring Helen Mirren Om Puri and Manish Dayal. Photo/Video Disney The title refers to the width of the street that separates two restaurants and two culinary worlds Le Saule Pleureur a provincial outpost of haute cuisine with a Michelin star run by Ms. Mirrens haughty Madame Mallory and directly opposite Cafe Mumbai a convivial family enterprise pulled together by Mr. Puris exuberant patriarch Papa after the loss of his restaurant and his wife to sectarian violence in India. Both of these adversaries begin as living cliches Papa carrying on like a carnival barker to attract a clientele Madame disdaining the whole spectacle for its garishness--for its foreignness--and focusing her passion on acquiring a second Michelin star. But both of them live vividly and enjoyably through shrewdly matched performances that have their charming counterparts in Papas older son Hassan (Mr. Dayal) Cafe Mumbais gifted dreamily handsome chef and Ms. Le Bons Marguerite a lovely sous chef on Madame Mallorys staff. ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" was directed by Lasse Hallstrom from Steven Knights adaptation of the novel by Richard C. Morais; the producers include Oprah Winfrey who championed the book and Steven Spielberg. Mr. Hallstrom is no stranger to foodie-land or France having directed the treacly fantasy ""Chocolat"" and he and his cinematographer Linus Sandgren certainly fulfill their first responsibility to this film--making the food look screen-siren glamorous. (Still it doesnt seem fair to French cuisine that Indian dishes come in otherworldly colors.) Treacle isnt on the menu though even if sentiment is. The cheerful comedy of Old World versus Emerging World is laced with the harsh reality of French xenophobia--Hassan and his family havent left violence behind them. Related Reading New Foodie Film Brings Clashing Cultures to the Table Speakeasy Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey Step Up for Movie Speakeasy Film Could Be U.S. Break for Indian Actor Om Puri At times the storytelling seems rushed or worse. Each of Hassans siblings gets a line of dialogue now and then but nothing that amounts to an identity. Its nice that Cafe Mumbai is an instant hit but unclear why Have French villagers suddenly become cosmopolitan? And everything goes off the rails when Hassan goes off to Paris starts cooking at a trendy hard-edged temple of molecular cuisine and becomes an overnight superstar. (The evolution of his career spanned two decades in the novel.) The film works best at its simplest when Hassan and Marguerite are gathering those mushrooms in lieu of rosebuds; when Madame Mallory samples Hassans piece de resistance his own version of a classic omelette and tastes more than words need express--the rise of Asia the decline of France and the multicultural multiflavored future. Rewind DVD //Streaming //Download ENLARGE Some Mothers Son (1996) This drama directed by Terry George from a script he wrote with Jim Sheridan has nothing to do with ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" but it exemplifies the protean gifts of Helen Mirren. She gives an extraordinary performance as the mother of a hardened young IRA fighter who imprisoned by the British gets caught up in a hunger strike. The issues the film poses are compelling--the value of life versus political principle a mothers respect for her sons principles versus her blind protective love. In Ms. Mirrens portrayal the priorities are unexpected and piercingly clear. ENLARGE East Is East (1999) The great Indian actor Om Puri is George Khan a Pakistani tyrant in this startling debut feature by Damien ODonnell. George is married to an Englishwoman whose seven children want to be English or left alone. Hes a brute and a fool yet Mr. Puris magnificent portrayal lends a nutty nobility to this intransigent patriarch who runs a fish-and-chips shop. Mr. ODonnell has taken inspiration from many sources among them Richard Lesters Beatles films and Tony Richardsons ""A Taste of Honey"" but his comic style is entirely his own and a source of intense pleasure. ENLARGE Chocolat (2000) Lasse Hallstrom directed this big-hearted petit-pois-brained fantasy about a mysterious beauty Vianne (Juliette Binoche) who opens a store that sells magical aphrodisiac candies. Though the setting is supposedly 1960s France the story really takes place in a timeless picturesque village--Brigadoon-cum-Deux Chevaux--populated with every cultural stereotype that France has ever inflicted on a gullible world (and on itself). The cast includes Johnny Depp Judi Dench and Leslie Caron who as an elderly woman named Madame Audel brings an air of amiable mute bewilderment to her few scenes.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Mark Jenkins August 7 2014 French and Indian restaurants stage a culinary showdown in ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" but the result is neither rich nor spicy. This rom-com-drama is merely amiable even when the two central couples pretend to be bristlingly incompatible. The movie is essentially a return to ""Chocolat"" director Lasse Hallstroms 2000 tale of a provincial French town that reacts badly to the arrival of deliciousness. In that story the intrusion was at least French; in this one its Indian. The newcomers are led by Papa (veteran Indian actor Om Puri) who decides to stay in the immaculately picturesque village where his family van breaks down. He has five children but only one matters to the story Hassan (Manish Dayal) a kitchen savant. The story is driven by three conflicts but two are easily resolved and the third is never really explained. Papa and Hassans new eatery sits 100 feet across a rural road from a Michelin-starred landmark run by the imperious Madame Mallory (Helen Mirren). She attempts to sabotage the competition but finds Papa every bit as bull-headed as she is. Indeed the two widowed restaurateurs seem a natural match. The very first person the family meets Marguerite (Charlotte Le Bon) is a stock character in movies about foreigners in the South of France the young beauty who travels exclusively by bicycle and always wears dresses. (Put a pair of Levis on Marguerite and shed curdle like overheated hollandaise.) She and Hassan are clearly meant to mate but Marguerite is an aspiring chef whos jealous of his culinary genius. The other antagonism is more substantial which may be why the filmmakers sidestep it. The Indian family was driven from Mumbai by a mob that burned down its restaurant killing Papas wife and the kids mother. But why? The source novel (by Richard C. Morais) acknowledges that Papa and his brood are Muslim something the movie never mentions. (The only hints are that Hindus tend not to be named ""Hassan"" or to cook veal and beef.) The script is by Stephen Knight whose work is usually tougher and tighter. Next to his recent directing debut ""Locke"" this movie looks flabby. Perhaps seeking to retain something of the books rhythm Knight and Hallstrom let a very simple story meander for two hours and include episodes that serve no dramatic purpose. Maybe they hoped the exuberant A.R. Rahman score would keep things moving. Dayal is bland and Le Bon not much zestier although both can reasonably blame underwritten parts. Puri and Mirren are lively and well-matched even if the British actresss French accent is distracting. As the towns gourmet mayor Michel Blanc is a big pleasure in a small role. But the real stars of course are the food and the scenery both bathed in celestial light. ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" is basically a promo reel for small-town France and Gallo-Indian food fusion. Anyone who requires a more substantial meal should eat before heading to the theater. Jenkins is a freelance writer.   PG. At area theaters. Contains thematic elements some strong violence language and brief sensuality. In English and bits of unsubtitled French and Hindi. 122 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Randy Cordova The Republic | azcentral.com 130 p.m. MST August 7 2014Charlotte Le Bon (left) as Marguerite and Helen Mirren as Madame Mallory in a scene from DreamWorks Pictures film ""The Hundred-Foot Journey.""(Photo DreamWorks)Story HighlightsCritics review 4 starsWhen Om Puri and Helen Mirren share the screen the movie really sparkles.The actors have a hard time competing with the beautifully photographed food.Lasse Hallstrom handles the films issues with warmth and caring.Theres comfort food and there are comfort movies. In Lasse Hallstroms ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" you get a full helping of both. And guess what? Its all very comforting.Thats not a slam. Hallstrom has a knack for crafting movies that are as snuggly as a nice cozy blanket. After all this is the man who made the abortion-themed ""The Cider House Rules"" into something a ""tea party"" grandmother could love. The ground covered in ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" isnt as polarizing but its handled with the same care and warmth.Based on a popular book by Richard C. Morais the movie follows an East Indian family that decides to open a restaurant in Europe. They settle in a lovely village in the south of France where they open an eatery called Maison Mumbai. The issue Across the street lies Le Saule Pleureur a Michelin-starred restaurant run by the intimidating Madame Mallory (Helen Mirren).AZCENTRALLasse Hallstrom talks Hundred-Foot JourneyInitially Mallory goes head to head with the clans patriarch (Om Puri utterly delightful). She complains about the Indian music wafting across the street; he buys out all the ingredients she needs at the villages outdoor market.Things turn after a racially motivated attack on Maison Mumbai draws Madame closer to the family particularly budding chef Hassan (Manish Dayal). He has dreams of moving beyond the family restaurant; he also flirts endlessly with doe-eyed Marguerite (Charlotte Le Bon) who works in Madames kitchen.AZCENTRALSomething for everyone 52 Fall films for 2014The movie touches on various issues. Some are deep -- the tensions between two cultures and how they can exist peacefully -- and some are as featherweight as the link between food and memories. But all are given equal weight under Hallstroms direction which never gets demanding or overly serious. Instead everything is handled in a charmingly sentimental fashion.The performers do excellent work. Dayal adds a slightly dark undercurrent to his role which pays off as the characters ambitions become more apparent. His scenes with Le Bon shine but it is when Puri and Mirren share the screen that the movie really sparkles. The two veteran actors have a delightful give-and-take and make the dialogue crackle.AZCENTRALAll the reviews Weekend movie guide for PhoenixStill even those old pros have a hard time competing with the food which is beautifully photographed by Linus Sandgren. Virtually everything appears succulent and mouthwatering; an omelet that Hassan creates is downright sensual.When some films end a viewer may ponder what happened to the characters.

Oof. The food is of course suitably gorgeous (like the French countryside like the young stars Manish Dayal and Charlotte Le Bon); all brightly colored and richly textured and artfully presented.

Produced by Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey and directed by the reliably complacent Lasse Halstrom (Chocolat Dear John) this middlebrow drama delivers just what youd expect from such a trio two hours of yummy dishes and nonthreatening ethnics. Ill spare you my usual rant about the decadence of foodies but it should be obvious by now that despite their discerning tastes the movies catering to them are the artistic equivalent of dinner at the Olive Garden. Screenwriter Steven Knight (Eastern Promises Dirty Pretty Things) adapted a best-selling first novel by former Forbes correspondent Richard C.

In films such as Hussy The Long Good Friday and The Cook the Thief His Wife and Her Lover she combined the classic femme-fatale ingredients of smarts and sensuality into a molten cocktail of deliciously unpredictable danger. Now at 69 Mirren seems to have become typecast as stern snoots and blue-blooded battle-axes. What happened? The obvious answer is that she got older in an industry that fetishizes youth especially female youth. But I think theres something else at work. Im convinced that Mirren was so indelible as the tough-as-nails inspector Jane Tennison on the excellent British series Prime Suspect that most folks -- including Hollywood casting directors -- have had a difficult time seeing past the hard edges and frosty hauteur that come so effortlessly to her. Mirren certainly starts off that way in Chocolat director Lasse Hallstroms latest feel-good slice of food porn The Hundred-Foot Journey. But one of the formulaic films few surprises is how the marvelous actress slowly blossoms from a stubborn prig into a romantic softy. For the first time in ages she lets us see the frisky grin behind the scowl. Based on Richard C. Marais 2010 novel -- and produced by Steven Spielberg and the queen of spoon-fed sentimentality Oprah Winfrey -- The Hundred-Foot Journey is a culture-clash confection about two rival restaurateurs competing for the hearts and taste buds of the same sleepy French village. On one side of the street is Le Saule Pleureur a Michelin-starred temple to foie gras pigeon with truffles and other refined delicacies lorded over by Mirrens condescending Madame Mallory. On the other is Maison Mumbai an open-air bazaar of exotically earthy fare cooked with a sprinkle of turmeric and a heavy dose of love by the Kadam family. Madame does everything she can to foil the newcomers from India not because shes a racist (the film makes a point of her firing her xenophobic French chef) but because their restaurant with its roaming livestock and blaring bhangra music offends her refined Gallic sensibilities. ""Who are zees people?"" she asks with her nose in the air and a stick firmly lodged up her derriere. Its war. The battle unfolds with all the predictability of a train-station timetable. The Kadams headed by the widowed patriarch (Om Puri) and his soulful chef son Hassan (Manish Dayal) awaken the parochial palates of the hamlets quirky residents. When Hassan proves to be just as gifted at conjuring up a mouthwatering bechamel sauce as he is with tandoori goat Madame wants him to help her win a second Michelin star. (He also turns out to be a natural at wooing her sous chef played by Charlotte Le Bon.) All of these by-the-numbers beats go down smoothly enough (at least until a jarring third-act detour sends Hassan to Paris). Its soothing easily digested comfort food. Which is to say its the perfect recipe for a filmmaker like Hallstrom. The director of Whats Eating Gilbert Grape and The Cider House Rules is a master at crafting a certain kind of well-appointed sap and manipulating audiences tear ducts (I get a lump in my throat just thinking about his 2009 Richard Gere sobfest Hachi A Dogs Tale). But as talented as he is at eliciting Pavlovian emotional responses with his middlebrow melodramas he also makes you resent him as soon as you crumple and toss your Kleenex. He rarely earns the catharsis hes after. Thankfully here he has Mirren and Puri as his sparring leads. I never entirely bought the flirty detente between the two or believed in the rapturous power of a perfectly cooked sea urchin to solve the worlds problems. But for two hours at least I swallowed it with a smile.

Updated July 30 2016  1153 am Full Forecast News Sports Business Go Life Buy/Sell Movie reviews Hundred-Foot looks good is short on substance By Joe Williams joewilliamspost-dispatch.com 314-340-8344 Joe Williams Aug 7 2014 (...) If you love food and France and second-chance romance you wont be able to resist ""The Hundred-Foot Journey""There I said it Oprah. Im blurbing that the movie you produced with sous chef Steven Spielberg is everything the two of you promised in the prelude video. Now cut me a check for half the amount that you and your bestie Gayle spent on Sunday brunch and I promise that I will cook up a hard-edged heart-tugger that will shatter the best of your book-and-movie club into a million little pieces.Oh wait the menu says that guts are not available in this establishment. I admit Im not a foodie and Ive got a worsening allergy to films about fussbudgets who find love by the time dessert is served yet even ""Casablanca"" curmudgeon Rick Blaine had a soft spot for France.""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" doesnt serve red meat but it pushes Pavlovian buttons. What fan of Winfrey or Spielberg doesnt instinctively cheer for an underdog especially one whos a victim of racial and class prejudice? What gastronome doesnt salivate at the sight of a food-prep montage especially one with the whiff of the exotic? And what romantic doesnt swoon from a vicarious visit to the French countryside especially one that is directed by a pro such as Lasse Hallstrom (""Chocolat"")?An idyllic valley between the English channel and the French capital is where the Kadam family finds itself after a fender bender. Recent immigrants from India they were on their way to Paris to open a restaurant. But after plucky Papa (Om Puri) discovers an abandoned building on the outskirts of a quaint village he decides to make it the new home of Maison Mumbai with his talented son Hassan (Manish Dayal) as the chef. Just a few steps across the road is a Michelin-starred restaurant run by snooty Madame Mallory (Helen Mirren). She is appalled by the music and the smell of curry emanating from the new neighbors whom she calls ""you people"" as she pesters them with regulatory complaints.But the caught-in-the-middle mayor develops a fondness for Indian food -- and Madame Mallorys cook Marguerite (Charlotte Le Bon) develops a fondness for Hassan. Although the outcome is as predetermined as a prix-fixe menu the storytelling is as smooth as goose-liver pate through a pastry nozzle. The notion that a joyless witch like Madame Mallory could be humanized by cumin is the kind of fantasy that fertilized ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" and ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" is a less-taxing trip.If you want lightly seasoned comfort food take a seat. But if you want deep-dish analysis of ethnic or culinary arrogance the maitre d suggests you take your business elsewhere.What ""The Hundred-Foot Journey""  Two and a half stars out of four  Rating PG  Run time 202  Content Thematic elements some violence language and brief sensuality Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

Photo DreamWorks The Hundred-Foot Journey review a trip worth taking 1 / 4 Back to Gallery The Hundred-Foot Journey Drama. Starring Helen Mirren Om Puri Manish Dayal and Charlotte Le Bon. Directed by Lasse Hallstrom. (PG. 122 minutes.) Theres nothing corny about ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" nothing quaint or false. It could have been all those things given the slightest wrong push but this is a Lasse Hallstrom film and he doesnt push. At his best - and hes at his best here - he just tends the garden with meticulous compositions and unforced performances and lets things blossom. The result is that this is one of those rare movies that gets better as it goes along. It unfolds one incident into the next in what feels like a methodical pace until very soon everything about it feels lived in and realized. Other directors are rushing and rushing and yet their movies go on forever and feel like it. Hallstrom always seems like hes lavishing time on everything and yet the action keeps moving forward. Heres one shot that tells you the difference between a really good director and just anybody Two young people are riding bicycles toward each other and theyre going over a little country bridge in a French village. The situation is uncomfortable because the two are estranged and yet they like each other. The young womans bicycle exits the shot and as the young man reaches the middle of the bridge he hears laughter in the distance and turns in the direction of the sound. The camera moves slightly and we see in long shot an idyllic country vista and a man and woman in a rowboat.

Its a status update on the state of one of the films principal relationships a snapshot from life a vision of paradise an emblem of the young mans longing and probably one or two other things that elude description. Its rich and seems inevitable but its really only there because a director had the sensitivity to feel it and put it there. ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" is about an Indian family that relocates to Europe with the intention of opening an Indian restaurant somewhere on the continent. Their car breaks down in rural France and the patriarch (Om Puri) falls in love with a property that happens to be across the street from a Michelin starred restaurant. Despite the exalted competition just one hundred feet away he decides to locate his new restaurant there which puts him into contact with the Michelin restaurants stiff-backed owner played by Helen Mirren. A lot happens in ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" but because none of it is earth-shattering theres a temptation to reveal too much of the story if only for the sake of talking about different aspects of it. This is a temptation best avoided because much of the appeal of the film is in the way it meanders and grows and breaks out of the usual confines. ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" is about food and life but not in the typical way of movies that dreamily ""celebrate"" both and make you want to throw up. The film isnt starry-eyed about food but intelligent about it. It has ideas about food which it does not spell out but which are implicit. The movie extols the respective boldness and subtleties of traditional Indian and traditional French cuisine. It stresses the importance of fresh vegetables with ""soul"" and its not against experimentation. But it raises an eyebrow at food faddism at innovation for the sake of innovation and its no accident that the worst-looking food in the movie is seen at a trendy Paris restaurant. As a talented cook with an innate gift Manish Dayal starts off wide-eyed then takes on a more complicated quality as the film goes on. Om Puri lends the father his wise fleshy-nosed humanity - hes like an Indian Philippe Noiret (""Cinema Paradiso"") or Walter Matthau. And though I cant help wondering what an actual French actress might have done with the role of a French woman Helen Mirren is an undeniable delight. At one point Hallstrom films the formidable Madame (Mirren) from behind as she eats an omelet and you can tell the precise moment that she realizes that the cook has talent. The French character actor Michel Blanc plays the mayor of the village and he gets considerable comic mileage out of a relatively small role. By the time ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" ends it has achieved an unexpected and rather powerful cumulative impact. I felt like I knew the people and wouldnt mind staying there.

(Francois Duhamel) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday August 7 2014 1201 AM Title The Hundred-Foot Journey Film Info With Helen Mirren Manish Dayal Om Puri. Two restaurateurs clash and connect in the South of France. Director Lasse Hallstrom (202). PG. Area theaters. ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" manages to be a full meal using all the ingredients at its disposal. Directed by Lasse Hallstrom (""The Cider House Rules"" ""Chocolat"") from a novel by Richard C. Morais the movie starts with conflict of a nonculinary kind. As a child Hassan Kadam is witness to the death of his mother and the burning of his home during seething riots in 1990s India. Years later the twentysomething Hassan (Manish Dayal) his younger brother and sisters his uncle Mansur (Amit Shah) and his wise Papa Kadam (Om Puri) decide to re-create the family restaurant business in Europe. While traveling through the South of France their car breaks down which Papa decides is a sign. Sometimes he muses a flat tire is not just a flat tire. The spot they choose for their Indian restaurant Maison Mumbai is on a picturesque stretch of road directly across from a Michelin-starred pristine boutique eatery run by the rigid Madame Mallory (Helen Mirren). She is not amused at the newcomer less then 100 feet from her door. Papa wants their shared customers to taste everything life has to offer -- and he sees their two styles as complementary not competitive. But Mallory does everything she can to shut the newcomer down. What she cant shut down is a growing romance between Hassan and one of her sous-chefs Marguerite (Charlotte Le Bon). She also cannot stop Hassans natural talent as a chef. When Mallory sees that she does what any good restaurateur would do She hires him. As she and Papa become friends they watch as Hassan goes to Paris and hear from afar of his fame. But Hassans heart will never be far from that road where his fathers and Mallorys restaurants remain. Charlotte Le Bon in The Hundred-Foot Journey (Francois Duhamel) Mallory is the kind of role Mirren does effortlessly. Starting out frosty but concealing a warm center she provides both the conflict and the growth in a film that really has little surprise. Shes aided by the silky-voiced Indian actor Puri who could make a reading of a Zagats guide sound delicious. Dayal adds a dash of complexity to a soulful role. Any movie with food as a motif runs the risk of pouring on the metaphor and that happens here too. (The film is produced by Oprah Winfrey who saw enough in the novel to make it one of her book club selections). The screenplay is by Steven Knight whose film earlier this year as a writer-director ""Locke"" rightly earned raves. This time he centers the story on people not plates which shows the best of taste. jneumaiernydailynews.com Tags movies movie reviews the hundred-foot journey lasse hallstrom helen mirren manish dayal om puri richard c. morais amit shah charlotte le bon oprah winfrey drama comedy Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet At its advance screening in Chicago The Hundred-Foot Journey commenced with an official video endorsement from its producers For a small eternity Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey traded food puns and positive platitudes the latter insisting that the movie everybody was about to watch would be suitably ""uplifting."" This sales pitch seemed not just desperate but completely unnecessary; as Waylon Smithers might point out the audience was already seated so there was no need to keep hustling them. Besides anyone who goes to a movie like The Hundred-Foot Journey knows damn well theyre in for some uplift. This innocuous crowd-pleaser delivers everything that its pedigree and ad campaign promise courting the patronage of foodies Oprah Book Club members Travel Channel subscribers and Helen Mirren lovers alike.Despite her prominent placement on the badly Photoshopped poster Mirren is not technically the star of The Hundred-Foot Journey which draws its palatable culture-clash plot from a 2010 bestseller. In fact the dame is initially positioned as the films nominal antagonist--the snooty proprietress of an upscale eatery in the tiny French village of Lumiere. Across the street from her revered establishment a family from Mumbai has dared to erect its own restaurant the stubborn patriarch (Om Puri) gambling that he can get the locals hooked on his exotic cuisine. His secret weapon is his son Hassan (Manish Dayal) a young cook who yearns to be a chef--and maybe also to share some forbidden fruit with the pretty French girl (Charlotte Le Bon) who works in the kitchen of his new rival. Can anything bridge the cultural chasm separating these culinary competitors?Journey force-feeds its audience lots of pretty rudimentary morals helpfully reminding that its feuding restaurateurs arent so different after all in spite of their opposing views on coriander. Though the film positions its central rivalry as a snobs versus slobs showdown--with Hassan and his family as the underdogs flying a flag for real flavor--it also shares with Mirrens Madame Mallory a drooling reverence for the Michelin star system. Molecular gastronomy is a source of oohs and awes until it becomes a sterile prison for a chef who needs to remember the value of real eats. The message is mixed Chase your culinary dreams but also go back to your roots because appearing on the cover of fine-dining magazines will never be as satisfying as being the big fish in a little pond.Returning to the food-as-unifier territory of his Oscar-nominated Chocolat veteran tripe peddler Lasse Hallstrom offers an endless buffet of food porn as well as enough postcard-pretty European imagery to paper the walls of a travel agency. His actors make the most of the ingredients theyve been given Theres a soulfulness to Dayals earnest puppy-dog routine and Mirren gamely upturns her nose in a futile attempt to disguise the obvious fact that her character has a heart beating beneath her snobbish facade. Everything goes down smoothly including the impossibly chaste romance. But for a film that champions the transcendent power of spice The Hundred-Foot Journey is awfully bland. Its less delicacy than comfort food--tasty enough but destined to stay with viewers about as long as the White Castle sliders they might eat on the way to the theater.

"Review Hundred-Foot Journey a satisfying confection - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Hundred-Foot Journey a satisfying confectionBy Randy MyersSan Jose Mercury News contributorPosted 08/06/2014 030000 PM PDTUpdated 08/06/2014 090433 PM PDT ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" whips up a satisfying cinematic meal for adults seeking respite from the summers usual fare of thundering explosions and special effects.Co-produced by Oprah Winfrey and Steven Spielberg along with Juliet Blake the charming dramedy set in a thoroughly charming French village and featuring a terribly charming cast led by Helen Mirren might not rate at the top of the movie food chain when it comes to daring innovation and plotting. But this predictable tale about an immigrant familys battle with an uptight chef doesnt need to be a revolutionary experience. What ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" does serve up amounts to a tasty dessert thats arriving at the right time just as were anxious to cleanse our palates of buttery blockbusters and rest up for the meatier offerings of fall.Directed by Lasse Hallstrom with a nice balance of heartwarming and heart-tugging this feel-good tale about an Indian family setting up a restaurant across the road from one with a Michelin star celebrates things all cultures can get behind family food and transformation.The glossy production culls together the kind of ingredients that led more mature audiences to feast so hungrily on ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel."" Here the appealing characters Linus Sandgrens enticing cinematography of southern Frances Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val and mouthwatering scenes of food porn are irresistible. Cynics will likely grouse over ""Hundred-Foots"" predictability and overstatement but when done right theyre all qualities that make for quality comfort food. And theyre done right here. Advertisement Enhancing the experience are a humorous screenplay and sweet-souled performances. On the surface screenwriter Steven Knight seems an odd choice for adapting Richard C. Morais under-the-radar novel. But the lauded wordsmith who gave us the grittier ""Dirty Pretty Things"" and ""Eastern Promises"" succeeds in making his flawed characters immensely likable while sprinkling in optimistic observations about the human spirit. Even when the film runs on too long the superb cast keeps us fully engaged. Mirren as the stern Madame Mallory is absolutely delicious delivering one classic expression after another and elevating the widowed character a lesser actress might have made a one-note caricature. Initially Mallory engages in a feud with the Kadam family as they work to open the scrappy Maison Mumbai restaurant across from her refined white-linened Le Saule Pleureur. Her attitude changes of course.Mirrens playful scenes with the head of the family Papa (Om Puri) are priceless. Puri is her perfect foil -- tender unpretentious and funny. When Papa begrudgingly accepts that son Hassan (a crush-worthy Manish Dayal) has culinary talents that simply cant be contained within the family restaurant Puri reacts without going overboard. Hassans ""hundred-foot journey"" leads him to new horizons but his path early on intertwines with Madame Mallorys sous chef Marguerite (Charlotte Le Bon also crush-worthy in an enchanting Juliette Binoche way).The resulting romance like everything else about ""Journey"" is a sweetly tailored one. It gets a bit bumpy as jealousies rise and main courses come and go and are praised.Culinary temptations have been taunting us all summer from Jon Favreaus ""Chef"" to the French film ""Le Chef"" and ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" doesnt disappoint. From the sinful Beef Bourguignon to the stomach-growling Pigeon aux Truffes theres more than enough to make our mouths water.But theres more being served than food. ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" nourishes us in other entertaining ways feeding an audience craving a main course thats more focused on relationships than explosions.The Hundred-Foot Journey   Rating PG (for thematic elements some violence language and brief sensuality)Cast Manish Dayal Helen Mirren Om Puri Charlotte Le BonDirector Lasse HallstromRunning time 2 hours 2 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES A Game of Thrones spin-off?

Photo DreamWorks II MOVIE REVIEW The Hundred-Foot Journey Running time 122 minutes. Rated PG (two brief bursts of violence). At the Lincoln Square the Beekman others. Cultures and cuisines clash agreeably in ""The Hundred-Foot Journey a mouth-watering and charming -- if overlong -- romantic comedy-drama about an immigrant family opening an Indian restaurant in a most unlikely location the South of France. When the restaurant theyve long operated outside Mumbai is destroyed in a political uprising the widowed Papa Kadam (Om Puri) moves his family to Europe finally settling in a picturesque village in the Midi-Pyrenees region of France where he rents a long-closed eatery. Om Puri and Manish Dayal star alongside Helen Mirren in ""The Hundred-Foot Journey.""Photo AP/DreamWorksII This displeases Madame Mallory (Helen Mirren) the imperious widowed owner of the Michelin-starred Le Saule Pleureur (Weeping Willow) which sits directly across the street from the upstart Maison Mumbai. Madame Mallory and Papa Kadam are quickly embroiled in a gastronomical war for ingredients with each wining and dining the gourmand mayor (Michel Blanc) to gain a political advantage. Meanwhile Kadams son and chef Hassan (Manish Dayal) is determined to master classical French cooking techniques and marry them to Indian cuisine. He finds an improbable ally -- and maybe much more -- in Madames spirited and beautiful sous chef (Charlotte Le Bon). Madame may be a snob but she also believes in ""liberte egalite fraternite -- and finally calls a truce after a racist attack almost puts Maison Mumbai out of business. She also learns much to her surprise that Hassan is such a talented chef that with his help Le Saule Pleureur could win a coveted second Michelin star. Helen Mirren dishes it out in the kitchen in ""The Hundred-Foot Journey.""Photo DreamWorks II This film is based on a novel by Richard C. Morais thats been described as a fusion of ""Ratatouille and ""Slumdog Millionaire Screenwriter Steven Knight of the gritty ""Locke"" created the original British version of ""Who Wants To Be a Millionaire while Oscar-winning ""Slumdog Millionaire composer A.H. Rahman gives ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" a lively score. With a creative team that includes producers Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey this could have been as schmaltzy as director Lasse Halstroms previous exploration of culture clashes the indigestible ""Chocolat from 2000. But it doesnt partly because of Linus Sandgrens food-porn cinematography. Theres no reason this film needed to run over two hours and it bogs down when Hassan takes a job at a fancy Paris restaurant specializing in molecular cuisine (a phenomenon treated with far less respect in the recent French film ""Le Chef). Even so ""The Hundred-Foot Journey manages to be a satisfying meal if not quite a feast for famished adult audiences. Its winning ingredients? The astringent performances of Mirren and the veteran Indian actor Puri (""East Is East) whose battling characters may end up sharing more than a passion for food.

Morais shares more than just a director with that Juliette Binoche confection. Theres also the quaint postcard-ready French setting the heavy-handed musings on the mystical power of spices and a prickly purse-lipped antagonist butting against the threat of change. The latter Madame Mallory (Helen Mirren in a deliciously salty turn) oversees a starched-linen fine-dining temple in the south of France. Her primary concern is securing yet another Michelin star--that is until thrifty Mumbai import Papa (Om Puri) and his brood move in across the road to open a vindaloo-stirring A.R. Rahman-soundtracked eatery of their own helmed by kitchen-prodigy son Hassan (Manish Dayal). The movies never tastier than when screen vets Mirren and Puri are sparring pettily buying out each others produce at the local market or bellyaching to the towns mayor. But when that rivalry reduces to a low simmer in favor of Hassans rags-to-riches rise in the food world the story goes bland. The film should have taken a cue from its spice-loving subjects and jacked up the heat.

Lasse Hallstrom has become an expert at making mom-jeans movies nonthreatening pictures in which headstrong women find love just when they think its too late (Once Around) take the upper hand with their cheating husbands (Something to Talk About) and turn small French villages topsy-turvy by opening chocolate shops (Chocolat). But the tragedy and the glory of mom-jeans is that theyre kind of comfy at least when theyre well engineered. Hallstroms The Hundred-Foot Journey in which the prim proprietress of a tres chic restaurant in the French countryside learns life lessons from a raucous family of Indian emigrees is almost embarrassingly enjoyable despite the fact that -- or maybe because -- its ridiculous in a shiny Hollywood way. You dont have to buy any of the pictures goofy fiddlehead-fern plot twists to enjoy Helen Mirren and Om Puri duking it out over which tastes better coq au vin or tandoori chicken. Theres pleasure to be had in watching them fume argue and ultimately make peace under the soft glow of a Michelin star or two. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Puris Papa is the head of a clan that runs a successful restaurant in India until a tragedy sends them packing first to England and then to France. By accident the family finds itself stranded in the almost cartoonishly picaresque town of Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val and Papa -- guided seemingly by mystical forces -- decides its a good idea to put down roots and open a restaurant. He finds the perfect locale just 100 feet from the hugely successful if staid Le Saule Pleureur run by the forbiddingly proper Madame Mallory (Mirren).Madame Mallory in her classically tailored suits and silk scarves doesnt like it one bit when these people whom she clearly views as stinky foreigners string up lights turn up the Bollywood soundtrack and open their vibrant and unapologetically ethnic establishment Maison Mumbai which infuses the neighborhood with an aroma of curry. But the restaurant is a breath of fresh air in the neighborhood which only makes Madame Mallory more resentful. It doesnt help that Papas eldest son Hassan (Manish Dayal) is a truly gifted chef a fact established in an early flashback scene showing the child Hassan gamely dip his finger into the pulpy center of a sea urchin. To further complicate matters sparks appear to be flying at least tentatively between Hassan and Madame Mallorys sous chef Marguerite (Charlotte Le Bon) who not only wields a mean carving knife but has also been graced with eye of doe and cheek of peach.Film Details The Hundred-Foot Journey RatingPG GenreDrama Running Time117 More Info Trailer Hallstrom working from Steven Knights adaptation of Richard C. Moraiss novel ticks off all the boxes This is a story about redemption and tolerance about finding love at any age or stage of life about the way cross-cultural ""You got chocolate in my peanut butter"" culinary fusion can bring us all closer as human beings. But it is first and foremost loaded with enchanting scenery and wicked food porn. Director of Photography Linus Sandgren captures the South of France its landscape dotted with those little pointy trees that look as if they should be growing out of decorated pots in all its sun-soaked glory. And theres lots of food being prepared plated and presented in colors so amazing -- the fiery orange-red of a tomato the bushy green of a parsley garnish -- they could incite stubborn toddlers to eat vegetables.The Hundred-Foot Journey gets a little sluggish in its last third the part where Hassan needs to prove himself -- and then prove himself again -- as a serious chef before he can find his true place in the world. But Dayal is an extremely appealing actor He takes what might have been stock scenes -- the moment where Hassan defies his role as a dutiful Indian son; the moment where the white girl rebuffs his tentative romantic overtures -- and teases out their subtler undertones.Its fun to look at beautiful young people like Dayal and Le Bon but in the end its the old pros who really bring it. Puri and Mirren make an unlikely but wonderful match. Puri has to spend a great deal of the movie sputtering and fuming but he still gives us a sense of this beleaguered patriarchs inner life. Papa is a widower who will never get over the loss of his wife but Puri plays him as a man who cant admit to himself that hed still like more out of life than hes getting. Theres a sidelong sadness in his eyes evidence of the kind of vague loneliness you hold at arms length because to acknowledge it might keep you from getting out of bed in the morning.It takes a while of course for Mirrens Madame Mallory to see Papa Puri for the gentleman of kindness and grace that he is. Mirren now an unbelievable age 69 has always been equal parts regal and earthy two qualities that would seem to be at war with each other. In The Hundred-Foot Journey her more majestic traits come to the fore Madame Mallory is too busy too practical too grown-up for sensory pleasures. But when she smiles -- finally -- and the skin around her eyes crinkles in that amazing way were reminded of how eternally beautifully girlish Mirren is. Youth supposedly is wasted on the young but Mirren hasnt lost the recipe. Shes still cooking.

TWITTER Helen Mirren and Om Puri play rival restaurateurs in Disneys big-screen adaptation of a food-forward novel. With its picture-postcard setting and mouthwatering Indian and French delicacies The Hundred-Foot Journey is a movie designed to comfort. Stimulating taste buds and little else Lasse Hallstroms latest film picks up where his 2000 hit Chocolat left off in terms of the affectionate shaming of provincial Gallic villagers. Starring Helen Mirren and Om Puri as rival restaurateurs in the Midi-Pyrenees region of France the film tracks a tension-free lesson in cultural exchange that culminates predictably in romance. Fans of the source best-seller and seekers of non-challenging counterprogramming to summers genre fare will savor the offering. But colorful locales and exotic spices cant hide its essential blandness. LIST The Hollywood Reporter Reveals Hollywoods 100 Favorite Films The comic drama follows a Mumbai familys move to France where a conveniently available run-down mansion/restaurant gives them the chance to resurrect the business they lost back home in devastating circumstances. Papa (Puri) a father of five and an unstoppable force who still communes with his deceased wife soon butts heads with Mirrens Madame Mallory who runs the elegant eatery directly across the road. Hers is a bastion of classical French cuisine and the proud bearer of a Michelin star. Madame wants a second one. Shes so downright spiteful that the eventual melting of her heart is a given. The thawing begins halfway through the movie with an act of xenophobic violence against the Indian family that proves only a minor blip for the characters even for Papas injured son Hassan (Manish Dayal). A gifted cook whos fascinated with French culinary tradition he falls for Marguerite (Charlotte Le Bon) Madames sous-chef as they explore the bounty of the farmers market and the local terrain. Their storys trajectory is as unsurprising as most everything else in the fairy-tale-tinged film but Le Bon brings a nice touch of passive-aggressive competitiveness to her role when Hassans career takes off. Screenwriter Steven Knights adaptation of the foodie-friendly novel by Richard C. Morais resolves conflicts quickly and places morsels of platitude about the ""flavors of life"" in characters mouths. For anyone who didnt see Ratatouille there are helpful reminders that ""food is memories."" LIST The Hollywood Reporters Top 25 Power Lunch Spots of 2014 But the main course is the dance between Madame Mallory and Papa however transparent the clash between her carefully composed plates and his bold flavors. Whether theyre filing ridiculous complaints about each other with the unflappable mayor (Michel Blanc) arguing over the proper presentation of ingredients or sharing a cafe table Mirren and Puri bring an effortless command to their roles. Linus Sandgrens widescreen camerawork gives farm-to-table its due and showcases a storybook French countryside through the seasons enhanced by digital effects. There will be fireworks.

It delivers the kind of sentimental sledgehammering I found myself willing to forgive -- the presence of Helen Mirren goes a long way in that regard -- but once the story goes off on a pointless tangent the whole souffle collapses. See video Billy Bob Thornton on Oprahs Master Class Everybody Wants to See Failure (Exclusive Video) Adapted by Steven Knight (""Locke"") from the novel by Richard C. Morais ""Journey"" follows budding chef Hassan (Manish Dayal ""90210"") and his family from Mumbai where their restaurant is burned down by political dissidents to a cozy small town in France which Papa (Om Puri) decides is the perfect place to get back into the food service industry. Theres an issue with the location location location that he chooses however its directly across the street from the swanky Michelin-starred restaurant run by uptight widow Madame Mallory (Mirren) who looks down her nose at these interlopers with their loud music (by A.R. Rahman natch) and their turmeric. Papa and Madame start out by going to war -- buying out each others ingredients at the local markets and complaining about each other to the well-fed town mayor (Michel Blanc) -- but when local resentment against the South Asian newcomers takes a racist tone the restaurateurs find common ground. Good thing since Hassan gifted at both cooking and tasting has become smitten with Madames sous chef Marguerite (Charlotte Le Bon ""Yves Saint Laurent"") although their romance grows strained when it becomes clear that Madame wants to bring Hassan into her kitchen and under her wing. So far so good Mirren is magnetic even in the early scenes when shes basically stuck channeling Dean Wormer from ""Animal House"" and she and old pro Puri generate a snappy back-and-forth. Dayal and Le Bon make a magnetic screen couple as well with his earnestness balancing the mischief in her button eyes. For all the actors making an impression here is more of a challenge than usual since this is a film where the produce and the sauces get all the good close-ups. Also read Aaron Paul Helen Mirren Join Colin Firth in Thriller Eye in the Sky Despite the movies heavy-handed storytelling I found myself caring about the relationships and even a little moved when the combative Madame Mallory makes a peace offering to her beleaguered neighbors. But then Hassan becomes a culinary superstar the third act is devoted to the country mouses seduction by the big city (and by molecular gastronomy which this movie depicts as the devils work) and the balance of ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" already at risk goes completely kablooey. Its an emotional jukebox where Hallstrom presses a button to elicit joy tears sympathy whatever and as such it will no doubt play well for undemanding viewers who just want to see delicious vindaloos wild mushrooms growing on a French riverbank and the melting of Helen Mirrens frozen heart (and apparently in some scenes her putty nose). Also read Lasse Hallstrom Why the Adopted King of American Emotionalism Went Home to Sweden for Bloody Thrills Cinematographer Linus Sandgren (""American Hustle"") takes advantage of the kitchen settings using flames and steam and sizzles to underscore what the characters are saying and feeling. (He does however throw in so many lens flares that I thought I was watching a J.J. Abrams joint.) The exteriors are postcard-perfect in the style of those riverboat-cruise ads that air right before ""Downton Abbey."" ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" in fact feels like a premium for PBS subscribers with occasional whiffs of multicultural notions that never obscure a by-the-numbers feel-good story.

Beef bourguignon or tandoori goat? Career success or family loyalty? You can actually have it all according to ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" a culture-clash dramedy that presents itself as the most soothing brand of cinematic comfort food. As such this genteel overlong adaptation of Richard C. Morais 2010 novel about two rival restaurants operating in a sleepy French village is not without its pleasures -- a high-energy score by A.R. Rahman exquisite gastro-porn shot by Linus Sandgren the winningly barbed chemistry of Helen Mirren and Om Puri -- all prepared to exacting middlebrow specifications and ensured to go down as tastily and tastefully as possible. With the formidable backing of Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey (who produced with Juliet Blake) the DreamWorks concoction should cater to a broad array of arthouse appetites particularly among those viewers who embraced the similar East-meets-West fusion cuisine of ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel."" If this Old World foodie fairy tale feels like an odd fit for screenwriter Steven Knight -- best known for his gritty London underworld thrillers and coming off an unusually adventurous directing debut with ""Locke"" -- its worth recalling that his scripts for the much edgier ""Eastern Promises"" and ""Dirty Pretty Things"" were directly concerned with the hostilities bred in and around specific immigrant communities. Still with its cozy crowd-pleasing temperament the new film represents all-too-familiar territory for director Lasse Hallstrom whose superficially similar ""Chocolat"" offered up a smug little parable about the triumph of sensual indulgence and liberal tolerance over stifling small-town conformity. The culture war examined in ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" is a bit less one-sided It contrasts the heat and intensity of Indian cooking with the elegance and refinement of French haute cuisine then balances the two with a feel-good lesson in ethnic harmony. Fleeing a tragic uprising in their native Mumbai for a more idyllic life in Europe the Kadam family led by their proudly outspoken Papa (Puri) decide to open an Indian restaurant in the South of France. Alas they soon find that they have merely abandoned one war zone for another as their scrappy new Maison Mumbai with its open-air seating and free-wandering chickens is soon locked in a fierce competition with the classy Michelin-starred establishment located just 100 feet across the road. That restaurant Le Saule Pleureur is run by the widowed Madame Mallory (Mirren) an unyielding perfectionist and proud defender of Gallic tradition whose first glimpse of her brown-skinned neighbors prompts her to sniff ""Who are zees people?"" Zees people little does she realize include one of the most talented young cooks in Europe. That would be our protagonist Hassan Kadam (Manish Dayal) who soon begins a sly flirtation with Le Saule Pleureurs beautiful sous chef Marguerite (Charlotte Le Bon); she in turn introduces him to the venerable tradition of French cooking which he becomes determined to master. The tension between these two characters sexual as well as professional is something the film keeps on a low simmer behind the more fiery confrontations between Papa and Madame Mallory neither of whom is afraid to resort to all manner of competitive sabotage -- whether it means sneakily buying up all the crayfish at the farmers market or filing complaints with the mayor (Michel Blanc) humorously depicted as something of a gourmand himself. Amid all this fun but childish oneupsmanship Knight and Hallstrom gently milk all the expected stereotypes for humor and conflict The French are snobs with their hoity-toity manners and expensive food and theyre deeply affronted by the thrifty tacky Indians with their colorful clothes and loud music. Frances ugly history of racial aggression and unrest particularly relevant at the present moment briefly punctures the films placid surface when local thugs attack and nearly burn down Maison Mumbai. But rather than lighting a fuse this trauma is what begins to unite the Kadams and Madame Mallory who soon realizes that Hassan is not only an exceptional cook especially when armed with his familys prized spice box but possibly the missing ingredient that could earn Le Saule Pleureur its second Michelin star. And so ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" becomes a story in which cultural opposites not only learn to coexist but are in fact triumphantly and even romantically reconciled. It may be set in France but really it could be taking place in any movie-manufactured fantasyland where enemies become the best of friends and an embittered old shrew turns out to have a heart of gold (and as Papa appreciatively notes looks rather fetching beneath the glow of computer-generated Bastille Day fireworks). Morais novel was described by the New York Times Ligaya Mishan as a hybrid of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" and ""Ratatouille"" and Hallstrom seems to have taken that Hollywood formulation to heart Like ""Slumdog"" the film is an underdog story set to the infectious backbeat of Rahmans music (fun fact Knight created the original British version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"") and like ""Ratatouille"" it brings us into an irresistible world of culinary sophistication and features gorgeous nighttime views of Paris where Hassan eventually arrives in search of his destiny. Where the film really overreaches is its attempt to reproduce ""Ratatouilles"" glorious Proustian moment that perfect bite of food that induces a heartbreaking recollection of childhood. This wannabe epiphany arrives deep into a draggy third act during which the script and the handsome Dayal struggle to give Hassan some semblance of a conflicted inner life but the character much like his meteoric rise to the top ranks of international chefdom remains something of a sketch. Its the older top-billed leads who manage the heavy lifting Though shes encumbered somewhat by her French accent Mirren is superb at both projecting an air of hauteur and expressing the vulnerability beneath it and she brings out a similar mix of pride and feeling in Puris Papa an excellent sparring partner whose stubbornness and drive to succeed never come at the expense of his love for his family. Shot on 35mm in luminous sun-dappled tones in the French village of Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val (with some second-unit work in India) and handsomely appointed by production designer David Gropman and costume designer Pierre-Yves Gayraud the film is also distinguished by its mouth-watering visual buffet whether lingering on vats of steaming red curry or a perfectly plated pigeon with truffles. This is no question an easy picture to succumb to -- perhaps too easy if its tidy narrative symmetries and its belief in the socially redemptive power of pleasure are any indication. Scrumptious as it all is it hurts to watch chefs so committed to excellence in a movie so content to settle for attractive mediocrity.

Did it have a compelling story worthy characters and clever dialogue the tripartite sine qua non?"" Yes...and yes. Reply Greg Tellis says August 13 2014 at 716 pm With all the great bilingual French actresses casting Helen Mirren pretending to be French and to speak French is insulting...zee people dont need to see thees Ms. Mirren in EVERYTHING. Reply Caliann Lum says August 8 2014 at 917 pm Actually dont disagree with the elements of your review. Nevertheless I enjoyed the film a lot - and Im a huge fan of Michael Bay films so not an easy sell. But sometimes its just nice to see a heartwarming film with excellent actors unfold beautifully under impeccably controlled and nuanced direction. It was mentally and visually refreshing to see such a skillfully honed and thoughtful film - despite its being a bit longer than I liked. Reply Carlo Irwin says July 25 2014 at 1152 am Boy dont you just love these so called experts criticize something they didnt (or couldnt) write? This is not my usual type of fare but this film has captured my interest and I look forward to seeing it. The mere fact that Helen Mirren goes from 50 calibre machine guns to a cooking pot is reason enough. The story sounds intriguing and as I have said before although I like imagination and stories about adventure (normally hate those dysfunctional stories) I like to see good stories. I also write and I always look for something with new ideas. I dont appreciate this reviewers luke warm approach.
