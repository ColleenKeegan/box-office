Lets keep real beside me being a being fan Jason Statam Robert DeNiro and the no-holds barred action genre the movie was great the performances were top notch the dialogue was slick and catchy the stunts and actions sequences were real exciting and exhillerating especially a Jason Statam fighting filping and jump out windows all while being tied up to a chair is being amazing. Not a suprise cause that what Statham is famous for in the first place. But the real joy was seeing DeNiro getting back to the heydays throwing with both fighting and shooting the guns like he did back in 1996 in Heat going toe-to-toe with Al Pacino proving the Two-Time Academy award winner still got it even at age 68 wow ""Killer Elie is a First rate action-thriller that is in deed Killer Good.""

By Peter Rainer Film critic September 23 2011 Save for later Saved Jason Statham (right) leaves retirement to rescue his former colleague (Robert De Niro) in Killer Elite Omnilab media/Album/Newscom          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? In ""Killer Elite"" Jason Stratham plays Danny an ex-Navy SEAL who is forced out of retirement to rescue Hunter (Robert De Niro) a former compadre in the assassination business. His rescue operation takes him to the Middle East the movie bad-guy locale of choice these days where a powerful dying sheikh is looking to avenge the killing by British agents of several of his sons.What all this semi-incomprehensible malarkey boils down to is a series of violent skirmishes between Danny and what seems like half the planet. Clive Owen playing a shady British operative is saddled with a silly-looking moustache. De Niro in what amounts to an extended cameo is radically miscast. Thats still no excuse for his nonperformance which is beyond lackluster. Grade C+ (Rated R for strong violence language and some sexuality/nudity.)

Open Road Films hide caption toggle caption Open Road Films Misfire Robert DeNiro (left) sleepwalks his way through Killer Elite also starring Jason Statham. Open Road Films Killer Elite Director Gary McKendry Genre Crime Action Running Time 105 minutes Rated R for strong language violence and some sexuality/nudity Take a look at a random photo gallery of stills from Jason Statham movies and you may be hard-pressed to tell one from another. There he is riding a motorcycle or driving a fast car or sprinting across rooftops while firing a gun always with that same steely gaze and singular sense of purpose. Purists may argue that no one has stepped up to fill the gap left as the brawny bunch of 80s action heroes -- Schwarzenegger Stallone Norris -- have aged well past the point of plausibly jumping out of moving vehicles without breaking a hip. (At least not without a wink to the audience that they know full well that theyre too old for this ... stuff.) But Id argue that Statham is the real deal and fully deserving of his role as the ""youthful"" contingent (at a sprightly 43) in the aging-actioner extravaganza The Expendables last year. Hes an imposing physical presence onscreen without being a hulk attractive enough to be a legitimate romantic lead with a gruff charisma thats sufficient to carry the lightweight needs of an action flick. Most important -- and this more than anything else is what allowed the old guard to be so fondly remembered -- hes enjoyable enough to watch that he can occasionally make one forget just how silly and dull a movie like Killer Elite really is. The film is ostensibly based on a true story a controversial book -- the facts of which are in some dispute -- by former British SAS officer Ranulph Fiennes. Statham plays Danny a hit man whos in the midst of his ""one last job"" as the movie opens but whos only a year into a bucolic retirement in rural Australia when news reaches him that his former partner and mentor (Robert De Niro seeming largely disinterested in acting) has been taken prisoner. i Statham plays his usual charismatic stoic -- leaping tall buildings and wooing stunning women as he chases down the bad guys. Open Road Films hide caption toggle caption Open Road Films Statham plays his usual charismatic stoic -- leaping tall buildings and wooing stunning women as he chases down the bad guys. Open Road Films The ransom is a job The Omani sheik responsible wants Danny to avenge the deaths of three of his sons each killed by a British SAS officer during the Dhofar Rebellion a few years before the films early-80s setting. Find the three men get confessions on tape then make the deaths look like accidents; mentor goes free Danny and his team get 6 million out of the deal. Thats a solidly defined premise if one thats put across unimaginatively in some lengthy word-dumps near the start of the film. Writer-director Gary McKendry seems as if hes sometimes under the impression that anxious camera work with random zooms and jittery edits can distract from blandly expository speechifying. Unfortunately the execution of that premise ends up being just as boring. Tracking down the officers and getting the confessions seems easy enough that it feels like a cheat and the only thing that sustains much interest in the films first half are the complex methods employed to make the killings seem accidental. Providing at least a little narrative conflict is Spike (Clive Owen) a representative of a secret society of former SAS officers who are almost comical in their stuffy wood-paneled Britishness. Theyre also prone to baldly expository tangents ""Thats why were called The Feather Men"" one says to Spike after telling him a series of facts that his character surely must already know. Spikes cat-and-mouse games with Danny lead to little more than the films centerpiece fistfight a jumble of tedious quick cuts right out of the Michael Bay playbook. Throughout a film that wants desperately to be a serious international thriller -- jumping from Oman to London to Paris -- Statham does exactly what Statham does best. He drives fast cars woos a beautiful woman jumps across those rooftops without that gun dropping from his fist and stares down the bad guys before dropping them with a well-placed punch. When he goes literally into a hornets nest in one of the films clumsier attempts at metaphor he stands firm and unaffected while his partner runs away. If being unassailably tough and cool under pressure could make an entire movie Killer Elite would be a Statham masterpiece. Ask for much more and it falls woefully short.

"Killer Elite review Big loud action with actual acting |       NJ.com comments Killer Elite review Big loud action with actual acting Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on September 23 2011 at 718 AM View/Post Comments Dan SmithJason Statham right with Robert De Niro as an assassin and his mentor in aKiller Elite.a Killer Elite"" is a dumb film. But its not stupid. Dumb because its a big loud action movie with lots of things blowing up tough guys beating each other even more senseless and plot twists that will be even more confusing when this film is finally seen in its natural environment on Saturday-night cable after a couple of beers. Its not stupid though because at least it knows enough to accept that its a big loud movie. And its smart enough to play to its own strengths by casting a genuine action star who doesnt need tricky editing to look good and adding several real actors to make him look even better. The star is the perpetually tense Jason Statham here playing a British SAS man -- the commando force that according to this film makes U.S. Navy SEALS ""look like a bunch of cupcakes."" I wouldnt put money on that one but hes definitely a bare-knuckled kind of guy. After the service he drifted into freelance assassin work. Then he retired. But now hes going to have to come out of retirement -- that is if he ever wants to see his former mentor alive again. Statham is a modest intense hero and the film lets him do what he does best -- leap off things drive cars very fast and knock people around -- while adding a bit of invention. In one great scene theres a three-way fight -- between Statham (whos tied to a chair) another man whos in handcuffs and the last who has the gun. Its the kind of goofy but exhilarating action sequence you used to see in Hong Kong movies and ""Killer Elite"" has a couple more like it. It helps too that Stathams mentor is played by Robert De Niro and the chief villain by Clive Owen. It goes without saying that both are fine actors; what may not be so obvious is that they make everyone else in the cast look better by elevating the tone a bit whenever the movie occasionally stops for a few lines of dialogue. Entertaining too is the 1980 time period (everyone except the chrome-domed Statham rocks some seriously awful hair). And the locations which range from Mexico to Europe to the Middle East add some exotic spice. Of course this is not quite ""The Bourne Identity"" let alone James Bond. If anything its closer to one of those cheap paperback series like ""The Executioner"" that tired businessmen used to read on the train. The plotting isnt very clear and the script has to go through a lot of dumb machinations to keep its assassin hero sympathetic. But the movies not stupid. And that makes it more than bearable and often a little fun. Ratings note The film contains continuous violence and strong language. Killer Elite (R) Open Road (100 min.) Directed by Gary McKendry. With Jason Statham Clive Owen Robert De Niro. Now playing in New Jersey.

James Adams The Globe and Mail Published Friday Sep. 23 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 240PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Action-film fans will find plenty to like in Killer Elite - theres no shortage of bang-bang/shoot-shoot in its 105 minutes not to mention one epic testicular punch-out in a hospital operating room between Jason Statham and Clive Owen. But the rest of us? Not so much. To be sure first-time director Gary McKendry keeps things moving at an adrenalized pace even through thickets of flashbacks. But this is precisely Killer Elites major problem motion at the expense of emotion. Screen grab from the online trailer for the action film ""Killer Elite"" starring Jason Statham Clive Owen and Robert De Niro Movies Killer Elite The official trailer Loosely based on Ranulph Fiennes 1991 ""factional"" bestseller The Feather Men the film has many instances where it could have savoured the ambiguities ironies and ethical cul-de-sacs embedded in its myriad twists and turns. Instead McKendry plays it by formula serving up the now-de-rigueur regime of car chases explosions oh-so-clever murder schemes slugfests and cliches masquerading as the soul of wisdom. Its a movie in which such lines as ""Someone has to do the dirty work"" and ""You cant run away from who you are"" are delivered with uninflected seriousness. And whatever quiet interludes there are are used less to elaborate character and motivation than as cursory premises for additional brutality and bandages. Of course could it have been otherwise when youve cast Jason Statham in the lead? The guys machismo incarnate all verbal constipation and coiled containment with a three-day five oclock shadow. Here he plays Danny Bryce an assassin-for-hire par excellence who suffers a spasm of conscience during a hit in Mexico. Retiring to the quiet of rural Australia he becomes smitten with a gorgeous tomboy (Maxim cover girl Yvonne Strahovski used here mostly as window-dressing) only to be lured back into the killing game when his mentor and friend (a very relaxed Robert De Niro) is imprisoned by a cancer-ridden sheik with only six months to live. To free his pal Bryce is ordered to find and kill the former British Special Forces agents who eliminated three of the sheikhs sons during a Cold War tussle in Oman. As De Niro languishes in the Middle East Bryce proceeds to assemble a cold-blooded crew a sort of Kings of Pain as the implacable instrument of the sheiks revenge. In doing so however Bryce crosses paths with Spike Logan (a relentlessly intense Clive Owen sporting a pert mustache) an ex-SAS agent blind in one eye whos part of a powerful shadowy organization charged with protecting decommissioned agents like him from avengers like Bryce. In short order of course the viewer realizes Spike and Danny arent so much antagonists as mirror images of each other twin sons of seemingly different mothers. The question then becomes Are these lunkheads ever going to realize that in playing Incredible Hulk vs. The Thing theyre only pawns in a larger more sinister game? Theres nothing terribly wrong finally with Killer Elite which had its world premiere 13 days ago at the Toronto International Film Festival . Statham and Owen are nicely paired De Niros restrained and action buffs will indubitably take comfort in the predictability and familiarity of the genres tropes. Yet for all its intimations of novelistic richness its a movie that settles for being a big-budget comic book.

(Dan Smith/AP) Elizabeth Weitzman Friday September 23 2011 400 AM Title Killer Elite With Robert De Niro Jason Statham Clive Owen. Action thriller about assassins forced into a dangerous job. Director Gary McKendry (145). R Violence language sexuality. At area theaters.When Robert De Niro Clive Owen and Jason Statham unite for an action thriller we should be able to expect something special. Or at least memorable. Instead ""Killer Elite"" gives us ordinary.The story takes place in the early 80s when emotionally tapped assassin Danny (Statham) decides to retire. But just when he buys a house and meets a girl (Yvonne Strahovski) his mentor Hunter (De Niro) is kidnapped by a sheik (Rodney Afif) demanding Dannys services. If he kills the secretive British officers who have murdered the sheiks sons Hunter will be released.So off Danny goes armed with a list of names and some willing accomplices (Dominic Purcell Aden Young). Unfortunately his immediate success is noticed by a former agent (Clive Owen) whose job it is to protect Dannys targets.The novel on which this movie is based Ranulph Fiennes ""The Feather Men"" created considerable controversy due to Fiennes insistence that it was factually inspired. That ought to lend the film a sense of palpable urgency.Though first-time filmmaker Gary McKendry does try to incorporate the intricate connections between so many shady operatives he doesnt have the nerve to embrace the storys seamier elements. What were left with is a mix of solemn spy talk and generic carnage.The only one who seems to be having any real fun is De Niro whos sidelined for most of the movie. But theres really not enough of anything here not enough De Niro not enough tension not enough ... action.And while McKendry clearly wants to aim higher even intelligent thrillers should be fast-paced and packed with adrenaline. He might want to rewatch the ""Bourne"" trilogy before he tries this again.Magic moment The first enthusiastically destructive faceoff between Statham and Owen.

Killer Elite"" is a snarly Euro-thriller with crust under its fingernails and bad breath. It doesnt care if you like it which is why I kind of do. Though thickly paved with stunts the film is pleasingly and plausibly complicated much more than youd expect considering the way it expresses itself with much talk like ""This all f - - king ends today"" ""Killings easy -- living with its the hard part"" and (really guys?) ""Who are you? Who do you work for?"" In 1980 Danny (Jason Statham) is a freelance hit man who gets roped into One. Last. Job. While hes busy cuddling his girlfriend he hears his partner (Robert De Niro who as he has been doing for nearly 20 years didnt seem to work very hard on his character) has been kidnapped by an exiled sheik from Oman who wants revenge against the British soldiers who killed his sons in an oil war. When Danny kills the soldiers hell get his old friend back. Hes disgusted by the mission but accepts offering to split the 6 million bounty entirely among his mangy partners (Dominic Purcell and Aden Young). Thanks to an incident in Mexico in which he nearly killed a helpless child Danny has turned against his old profession and he hates the idea of innocent people getting killed. His opposite number Spike (played by a fully engaged Clive Owen and the years Best Supporting Mustache) works for a shadowy group of businessmen and bankers (we know this because one of them says ""Were businessmen and bankers"") who are also ex-SAS men -- British special forces. Spike is the guy you call when your former comrades in arms start dying in mysterious ""accidents."" (Its a condition of the sheik who hires Danny that all of the murders look accidental just in case he wants to do an oil deal with the UK government.) The film (which is unrelated to the 1975 Sam Peckinpah effort ""The Killer Elite"") is based on an allegedly nonfiction book by celebrity adventurer Sir Ranulph Fiennes. I dont necessarily believe that any of this really happened -- Sir R. being a bit of a blustery old Evelyn Waugh/Monty Python character -- but Fiennes did serve with British forces in Oman and for a thriller the story is fairly near-fetched. It also moves speedily and not in the shallow sense of jittery editing. Allow your attention to wander and you may never regain your footing as director Gary McKendry sprints from Mexico to Australia to Oman to the UK and Paris. It also doesnt waste time on political correctness (the girlfriend who I think is the only woman with any dialogue is just the girlfriend not a girlfriend/kickboxer). There is no smirking no niceties -- just chasing punching and shooting. Statham and Owen (may they make many more movies together) arent even properly introduced before they start trying to kill each other and Stathams big scene with a chair is as elaborate as a Jackie Chan set piece minus the whimsy. The implacable Statham isnt the man to play internal struggle but the way he keeps trying to put a cork in the violence gives the movie a moral backing of sorts. Knowing theres a little decency out there makes it OK to enjoy the rude impunity of everyone else. When asked to identify himself one bad dude (whom we barely get to know) replies ""Im the man who gets to fly around in an unmarked helicopter with a gun in his pocket.""

Good luck figuring out who falls into that last category. Dannys bullets - along with the ones from other peoples guns - fly so indiscriminately that it doesnt really matter whos the hero and whos the villain here. Like a first-person-shooter video game there seems to be a virtually limitless supply of bad guys including in many ways the star of the movie which posits that 2 percent of the worlds population (or nearly 140 million people) are natural killers. Moral ambiguity - if not the decline of civilization - may be the point to the extent that there is one in this bloody and needlessly complicated exercise in adrenal fatigue. Mind you the taxing nature of the violence is felt only by the audience. Danny and the films cast of killers - who you might think have higher than normal job stress - dont appear to be terribly troubled by what they do for a living. ""Killing is easy"" says Danny. ""Its living with it thats hard."" You wouldnt know it from watching ""Killer Elite."" Living with blood on his hands seems pretty easy for Danny despite his decision early in the film to get out of the business after almost blowing a little girls head off. The fact that Danny has just killed her father doesnt bother him so much. After a mere years vacation however Dannys back in the game - with no apparent loss of sleep or soul-searching - when he learns that an Arab sheik has taken his BFF and former partner Hunter (Robert De Niro) hostage. It seems that Hunter is being used as leverage to get Danny to carry out one last assignment the execution of three British special forces agents who killed three of the sheiks sons. To further complicate matters Danny not only has to get the men to confess on videotape but he must make the killings look like accidents which leads to a bit of ""Mission Impossible""-style trickery. Keep in mind that all this is just the setup. The real conflict doesnt get underway until much much later after the three men have been summarily - if creatively - dispatched along with Dannys assistants played by Aden Young and Dominic Purcell. [Note If your name doesnt appear above the films title youre probably not going to make it to the closing credits. In Young and Purcells case its a shame. They bring an idiosyncratic verve to the proceedings. So does De Niro who for once doesnt seem to be phoning in the mostly thankless part.] As it turns out Dannys special-ops victims had been taking orders from a shadowy fellow called Spike (Clive Owen). So hes the real bad guy. Or is he? Spike gets his marching orders from a bunch of even more shadowy fellows called the Feather Men. They sit around in conference rooms deciding the fate of the world and who lives and dies. Needless to say they want Danny dead which leads to a drawn-out showdown between Danny and Spike characterized by such gymnastic impossibilities as the scene - replayed ad nauseam on the TV ads - in which Danny while duct-taped to a chair disarms Spike and then leaps chair and all through a glass window and onto the roof of a nearby truck without apparent injury. Its an amazing stunt if less than the pinnacle of the cinematic art form. Despite such heart- and credulity-straining thrills the film is bogged down by a cliche including a girlfriend (Yvonne Strahovski) who doesnt know what Danny does for a living. Other than sharing a plot built around assassination ""Killer Elite"" has no relation to the 1975 Sam Peckinpah film ""The Killer Elite."" Although the new movie is being packaged rather astonishingly as fact-based its source is a 1991 book ""The Feather Men"" by Ranulph Fiennes who has described his book as ""faction."" Ive got another portmanteau word for the movie unbelievaballistic. Contains copious violence and obscenity and some sex and nudity.

Comments Killer Elite Rated R  105 minutes  2011 Pure punishment this rote action flick from Australia features a trio of big names--Jason Statham Clive Owen and Robert De Niro--in a globe-trotting story about a vengeful Arab sheikh a secret assassination squad and righteous special ops warriors from the UK. According to the onscreen titles its based on a true story but the source material was a 1991 novel The Feather Men whose author Sir Ranulph Fiennes has been flip-flopping on the books authenticity for years. Expect the usual demolition derby macho one-liners and perfunctory romance (between Statham and Aussie babe Yvonne Strahovski). Three months from now this will be just another entry in some blog round-up of De Niros worst movies a competition that gets tougher all the time. By J.R.

Artificial slope to open at Buck Hill this fall next Movies 130363578 An odd couple of spies in Killer Elite Jason Statham and Robert De Niro - surprise - in a tangle of violence.  |  out of 4 stars By Colin Covert Star Tribune September 22 2011 -- 224pm Dan Smith Open Road Films Robert De Niro left and Jason Statham in ""Killer Elite."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint If theres anything sadder than a routine bad film its an ambitious bad film. ""Killer Elite"" is such a case a machine gun actioner aiming to put a smart new spin on its garish cliched genre. With a B+ cast and a script full of pseudo-profound moral complexities its aspirations are lofty and its achievements are trifling. The film shares a title and theme with Sam Peckinpahs 1975 spy film and features a similarly self-sabotaging tangle of plot. Like its predecessor the new film concerns undercover operatives fed up with the amorality of their calling but finding it difficult to make a clean getaway. The film stars Jason Statham and Robert De Niro who make the oddest pair of buddy spies since Chris Rock and Anthony Hopkins battled terrorists in ""Bad Company."" The opening act has the pair assassinating a Mexican kingpin before the horrified eyes of a child a snafu that inspires Statham to glower retire to a tumbledown Australian farm and take up with a sweet-natured neighbor (Yvonne Strahovski). His happy ending is put on hold when De Niro is kidnapped by a sheik. In exchange for his release the chieftain demands that Statham kill three English military men who killed three of the sheiks sons. Statham recruits a team begins eliminating the targets in amoral fashion and growls ""Killings easy. Living with its the hard part."" His actions draw the attention of Clive Owen an equally tough clandestine agent leading to several head-slamming showdowns. Unlike Stathams character Owens is driven by righteous fury. He has been given one dead eye -- symbolism alert -- representing his moral tunnel vision. He hasnt yet realized that the goals of the organization employing him are as dirty as their methods. He reaches his moment of alienation long after audiences will reach theirs. The locations in England and Jordan are garbage-strewn skuzzy and glamourless a comment on the grubbiness of private-contractor mercenary work and the shadowy corporate/government power systems that employ it. Director Gary McKendry who co-wrote the script with Matt Sherring seems to think hes offering an adult take on high-caliber high-explosive Tony Scott hackwork. The lack of a single clear-cut villain is a rebuke of action movie conventions but the mess of overlapping betrayals and paybacks never yields a satisfying climax. The film does offer one moment of twisted pleasure though. In his last scene De Niros character gleefully stuffs his pockets with dirty money before running for the hills. Its a warped commentary on the latest paycheck cameo role for a once-great actor. Its a good possibly intentional joke. Too bad the laughs on us. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

""Im done with killing"" Danny mumbles Stathamesquely. More about Killer Elite >> ""Yeah well maybe killing aint done with you"" says his partner and mentor a guy named Hunter and a guy who looks an awful lot like Robert De Niro squinting stubbly acting tough. And so goes the ricochet of cliches in Killer Elite a slam-bam shoot-em-up inspired by a true story in which Statham must come out of retirement to save his old pal. Danny has sequestered himself on a sprawling farm in the Australian outback in the company of a fetching Australian outbacker (Yvonne Strahovki). But when he hears that Hunter is being held hostage by an Omani sheikh Danny has no choice but to go into business again. The sheikh is hungry for revenge There are three Brits part of a disbanded special forces squad who were responsible for the deaths of three of his sons. Unless Danny delivers proof of the perpetrators demise his buddy Hunter is a goner. Based on fictionalized accounts of real-life SAS operative Sir Ranulph Fiennes - and bearing no relation to the 1975 Sam Peckinpah movie of the same name - Killer Elite delivers plenty of action as Statham pursues his prey and Clive Owen playing an ex-SAS operative by the name of Spike pursues him. Wearing a goofy mustache (excuse Killer Elite is set in the 80s) and pushing the macho quotient into the danger zone Owen looks particularly uncomfortable barking orders to his sidekicks and bearing down on his nemesis. The actor is better suited to roles that call for surface calm a soft voice; let the anger and angst well up in his eyes. Here he just looks silly. Statham on the other hand can do this stuff in his sleep - even if hes required to propel himself backward through a second-story window still strapped to a chair. Loaded with careening car chases and rooftop runs glass-shattering shootouts and exploding fireballs Killer Elite offers more than enough to keep action junkies happy. But if you want some meaning with your mayhem or even a good line of dialogue or two look elsewhere. Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + ""Killer Elite is based on a true story and about a half-dozen Jason Statham movies. Conveniently it stars Statham as a man-for-hire who drives mysterious cargo across Europe in the trunk of a sedan.Wait thats him in ""The Transporter. Let me see. Oh. Yes. Here hes Danny Bryce an assassin-for-hire who wants out of the assassin-for-hire business but is dragged back in for One More Job after an Omani sheik kidnaps his old buddy and partner in vigilantism (Robert De Niro). The ailing sheik (Rodney Afif badly made up) bears a passing resemblance to Osama bin Laden and insists that Statham hunt down the agents in the clandestine British Special Forces that killed his sons.Honestly from here its all a blur and not one to be entirely confused with Sam Peckinpahs ""The Killer Elite another tale of agents and death. The ""true story of the new film remains in dispute. The source material is ""The Feather Men by the British soldier and explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes. Fiennes has described his literary mode as ""factional. The movie written by Matt Sherring goes out of its way to insist on the truth while conjuring an element of government-agent intrigue. In doing so Sherring closes the gap between reality and such Statham adventures as ""Death Race and ""Crank High Voltage.As a Statham character is wont to do Danny daydreams about the woman he left behind and rejoins some former teammates - Aden Young and an enjoyably greasy Dominic Purcell whos better here than he is as the town dimwit in the current ""Straw Dogs remake. Statham does some driving and has a couple of decently choreographed fights with Clive Owen whose comrades Dannys been picking off. But he often looks bored or baffled. Both are understandable. Its impossible to keep track of whos who and why whats happening is happening. With some assassin exercises thats to be expected. Then however the film has to give you something in exchange for your confusion. Bravura lunacy the sense that someone in front of the camera or somewhere behind it is having a good time.Gary McKendry hadnt directed a feature before this one and you feel it. Any scene that fails to involve the revving of motors or the breaking of bones is dead.The advertising for ""Killer Elite might lead you to believe that De Niro and Owen have more of a stake in the proceedings than they do. McKendry has simply made a Statham movie with De Niro and Owen flavoring. The fights between Statham and Owen are competent but dull. Theyve been lighted and edited to make it hard to tell when the stuntmen have taken over and choreographed so that Owen looks like he really could have the upper hand on Statham. Thats persuasive only if the fighting is at the end of ""Hamlet.""Killer Elite spends much too much time with its star in a stationary position. No one pays to watch Statham wait in a car. So its something of a relief to see him spin and flip while tied to a chair. The sight of him speeding along rooftops and through parking lots abandoned warehouses and shipyards is like watching a nature organization release an animal back into the wild.The movie doesnt give him enough do with Owen and De Niro who toward the end of the film is looking hale and happy to be here. They do share a desert encounter that seems digitally altered to bring them together. What you notice there is that their sunglasses are working a lot harder than the men behind them.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. Follow him on Twitter wesley_morris.

Guys whove been put through chick-flick hell by women who forcefeed them perfumed pabulum like I Dont Know How She Does It should consider this testosterone payback. More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Statham plays Danny a retired Navy Seal and hired assassin whod rather shack up in Australia with his curvy girlfriend (gorgeous Yvonne Strahovski). But theyre pulling him back in. An Omani sheik (Rodney Afif) has kidnapped and tortured Dannys old killing partner Hunter (De Niro) and wont let him go until De Niro gives a decent performance again. Just kidding. The sheik wants Danny to go medieval on the ass of some British Special Air Service jocks who killed his sons. The sheik also wants Danny to bring back video confessions and proof of the kills. So Danny builds his team. And Clive Owen as Spike (love the name) builds his SAS team to stop him and protect his comrades. The fun such as it is is all in the hardass action and newbie director Gary McKendry delivers the goods. Statham is dynamite at this mayhem though The Bank Job showed he could do better. Owen seethes with manly brio. And De Niros grin seems motivated by more than a paycheck. But theres nothing elite about this disposable time-killer. Based on The Feather Men by ex-SAS officer Ranulph Fiennes (Ralphs cousin) Killer Elite pretends to be fact-based and true to its 1980s period. Just know its all baloney.

"Killer Elite | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; killer-elite ) Killer Elite (United States/Australia 2011) September 22 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Despite having a perfect cast for a title like Killer Elite Gary McKendrys feature debut comes across as little more than a generic Jason Statham movie with two high-profile guest stars. However while Clive Owen and Robert De Niro add some star power to this otherwise unassuming motion picture their presence does not stitch together the seams evident in a hit-or-miss screenplay nor does it enliven the safe and somewhat static approach embraced by McKendry as he feels his way. Killer Elite contains numerous action sequences but too little compelling connective tissue for it to be more than a high octane diversion. This should have been released during the summer. Killer Elite opens with a caption that informs us it is ""based on a true story"" as if that somehow excuses some of the short-cuts and coincidences. In fact the factuality of the source material Ranulph Fiennes The Feather Men has been challenged and in some cases debunked. Theres probably a kernel of truth lurking somewhere beneath the surface in Killer Elite but to accept it as anything more than a motion picture interpretation of a largely fictional novel would be a mistake. The story which transpires in 1981 concerns the revenge plot of a sheik in Omar who hires professional assassin Danny (Statham) to kill the British SAS officers responsible for his sons deaths. As collateral the sheik captures Dannys partner Hunter (De Niro) who will be released only upon completion of the triple killing. To make matters more difficult Danny is required to obtain videotaped confessions from each man and to make the murders seem like accidents. He is aided by the two other members of his crew - burly Davies (Dominic Purcell) and technically savvy Meier (Aden Young) - and opposed by an ex-SAS crack operative named Spike (Owen). The story is pieced together in a straightforward somewhat predictable fashion. Once Spike becomes involved things get a more interesting since it introduces a degree of gamesmanship. We are never given sufficient details to savor Dannys work - the killings are handled expeditiously and the way in which they are presented feels almost like a shorthand outline of a much longer draft. There are also murky backroom individuals whose motives are as shady as the venue in which they meet. All of this hints at a vastly more complex story than the one that evolves on screen. Killer Elite like just about every other Jason Statham film is fights and shoot-outs and car chases. Theres not appreciably more here. Statham is his usual dour square-jawed self. Danny has developed a killers remorse but that surfaces only when its convenient and he has a love interest (played by the willowy Yvonne Strahovski whose TV stardom results in her having more scenes than is necessary). These attempts are made to flesh out the character but theyre only partially successful. In the end this is about Statham and Owen trying to out-badass each other. Kind of fun but not as fulfilling as one might hope. For the most part De Niro remains on the sidelines - his character is kept in confinement for about 2/3 of the movie. He gets in on the fun at the beginning and the end. Had Killer Elite been made with B-list co-stars instead of Owen and De Niro it would have been easy to lump together with other Statham vehicles like The Transporter and Crank. Its a little better grounded than either of those earlier movies but it is essentially gunning for the same audience. The problem is that having spent the money to hire Owen and De Niro its incumbent upon McKendry to give them something interesting to do and that really doesnt happen. Both of these men are good actors but too often they agree to appear in subpar material for the paycheck (this has been increasingly true of De Niro). Killer Elite is just another example. Theres enough action to keep viewers awake and moderately interested but the lack of a compelling back story and the failure to do more than paint-by-numbers character development makes Killer Elite unfulfilling and anything but ""elite.""

Statham plays Danny a British ""cash for trash mercenary"" who in a 1979 prologue set in Mexico suffers a near-death experience and is saved by Hunter (de Niro) his American comrade in arms. Thats it. Dannys done. Done with killing. And yet he is so not done After a respite in the Australian Outback Danny is pulled back into the game when Hunter is kidnapped by an Omani chieftain out for revenge. The sheiks sons were casualties of the SAS involvement in the covert Oman War. The English ""sent their fiercest dogs to kill for the sultans oil"" says the sultan of exposition early on. The sheik demands that each of the SAS soldiers responsible for the deaths be eliminated. Theres an absorbing movie in this. But it doesnt jibe morally or narratively with the movies other half a reunion buddy picture about Danny gathering that old gang of his to do what must be done. Shooting mostly in Australia (which doubled for Mexico London and Paris among other locales) first-time feature director Gary McKendry goes for a grubby Paul Greengrass-style of hand-held action but he doesnt yet have the facility or the visual lucidity for it. Owen plays an SAS assassin of uncertain loyalties both an ally and an enemy. Matt Sherrings script is the real culprit here however. By the time Dannys lover (Yvonne Strahovski) delivers the inevitable ""I dont know where you go ...

Killer Elite (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Killer Elite (R) Although it aims higher than your garden-variety shoot-em-up this slam-bang action thriller is the same-old. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com9/21/2011 Editor rating 2 Loosely based on a supposedly true story Killer Elite is a better-than-average shoot-em-up as far as shoot-em-ups go. There are a couple of moments of genuinely intense action and some impressive stunt work and first-time director Gary McKendry does his best to keep everything in the film reasonably plausible -- something most action flicks today cheerfully ignore opting for bigger is better. But Killer Elite is too formulaic to overcome a been-there done-that feel. The movie is based on Ranulph Fiennes novel The Feather Men which was sold as a fictionalized memoir. Jason Statham stars as Danny a killer-for-hire (will this actor ever take on a role that doesnt require him to shoot guns or twist peoples necks?) whose mentor the none-too-subtly named Hunter (Robert De Niro) is kidnapped by an Omani sheikh (Rodney Afif) and held for ransom. In order to secure his friends freedom Danny must travel to England and take out the former SAS agents who killed the sheikhs sons. He must also get videotaped confessions just before they are executed for proof of their deaths.Danny decides to make the deaths seem accidental so as to avoid attention from British authorities. But the trick doesnt fool veteran hitman Spike (Clive Owen) who quickly latches on to Dannys plan and tries to stop him before he can finish his bloody mission. Killer Elite contains some impressive fight scenes including a brutal throwdown between Statham and Owen so realistic you wonder if the actors may have broken some bones. Owen whose character lost his eyes while on the job and now sports creepy blood-shot transplants is particularly good at radiating intensity and obsessive drive. But the movie doesnt delve into the psyches of men who kill for a living opting for a much more superficial approach derivative of countless other films about assassins. Despite some deft twists the outcome is never in question These men may be capable of practically anything (in one scene Statham has to fight off baddies while tied to a chair with his arms behind his back) but the film fails to convey the mindset and constant paranoia of people whose profession is murder. The most honest scene in Killer Elite is a shot of De Niro gleefully stuffing his pockets with wads of money before getting out of town That is essentially what the entire cast is doing although Statham and Owen work hard to earn their pay. De Niro who now acts strictly for a paycheck coasts through the film with an embarrassed smirk. Oh how the mighty have fallen.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Killer Elite an adaptation of Sir Ranulph Fiennes controversial bestseller The Feather Men purports to be based on actual events chronicling the sinister machinations of a shadowy military organization. But this clumsy action movie feels too generic to be real. The film attempts to add an element of sophisticated sociopolitical commentary to the typical Jason Statham head-busting shoot-em-up but only ends up draining it of visceral thrills. Killer Elite is less a cerebral thriller than an underachieving time-waster with feeble pretensions. In a performance that stubbornly fails to expand on his steely persona a scowling all-business Statham stars as an elite former Special Air Serviceman intent on getting out of the assassination business. Statham longs for a simpler less violent life but when mentor Robert De Niro is kidnapped hes forced back into action as a frighteningly efficient professional killer. In order to win De Niros freedom Statham must kill three accomplished operatives under the leadership of the unfortunately mustachioed Clive Owen. Killer Elite aspires to a level of moral ambiguity far beyond its shaky command. Director Gary McKendry wants to explore the complexities of killing in the name of preventing further bloodshed but the moral and political elements amount to little more than window dressing. At a seemingly endless 105 minutes Killer Elite drags on so long that its own characters seem to be willing it to stop. The third act is littered with dramatic declarations that all of the conspiring and killing must stop; the characters are all clearly as bored with the double-crosses and complications as the audience is liable to be. Killer Elite ends with a disclaimer largely conceding that its claims of being based on a true story are suspect. Thats one final disappointment in a film full of them.

This coldly violent overlong cat-and-mouse game requires the principals to declaim their various reasons for offing one another lest we lose track for lack of caring. The lead-heavy dialogue reflects the movies general lack of finesse. ""Im done with killing"" says Danny (Jason Statham) a world-weary mercenary with world-class stubble. ""But maybe killing aint done with you"" says a shadowy agent (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) who lures Danny out of retirement using the imprisonment of Dannys grizzled mentor (Robert De Niro) as bait. ""You cant run from what you are"" says Spike (Clive Owen) the ex-British Special Air Service (SAS) soldier trying to take out Danny before Danny takes out other rogue SAS types. ""Thats not what I am thats what I have done"" says Danny who also expounds ""Killing is easy; living with its the hard part."" In fact killing looks ridiculously easy in this dispensable exploitation pic directed for maximum impact of head-cracking pain by ad-trained Irish director Gary McKendry in his first feature. The glossy topcoat provided by the paycheck participation of De Niro and Owen cant cover up the essential emptiness of the project.

The Killer Elite Fair Director Gary McKendry. Cast Jason Statham Clive Owen Robert De Niro. Rating R for strong violence language and some sexuality/nudity. This weeks new movie releases Spotlight Robert De Niro If you want the international political thriller it pretends to be from time to time you wont. Better then to enjoy the implausible killing prowess of Jason Statham Robert De Niro and Clive Owen than to dwell too much on the cliche-ridden story based on Sir Ranulph Fiennes ""factional"" novel that stirred controversy upon its publication in 1991. Interview Clive Owen on Killer Elite. The film which has no relation to Sam Peckinpahs 1975 movie of the same name begins with Danny (Statham) and Hunter (De Niro) carrying out a complex hit in Mexico that goes awry so much so that Danny announces hes getting out of the assassin game. He moves to Australia and starts work fixing up a dilapidated house in the middle of nowhere. But he gets information that Hunter has been kidnapped in Oman; Danny has to meet with the tribal sheikh (Rodney Afif) who took Hunter and who will pay Danny 6 million and release his friend if Danny will assassinate the Special Air Service soldiers who killed the sheikhs sons. Its hard enough to kill an SAS man much less three. And theres more Danny must also force them to confess on-camera to the killings and make their deaths appear unrelated. But with the help of his running mates Davies (Dominic Purcell) and Meier (Aden Young) they start to work. What they werent counting on is the interference of Spike (Owen) a bitter former SAS soldier wounded and forced into retirement. Or so everyone thinks. He still operates secretly at the behest of the Feather Men themselves former SAS men who now scheme in suits to control chunks of the world and what goes on in them. (They get their name from their light-as-a-feather touch - in other words nothing gets pinned on them.) Theyre not sure whats going on here exactly - something to do with British involvement in Oman they figure a ""messy"" business - but Spike is more than willing to pick up the thread and whatever weapons happen to be lying around to protect his fellow soldiers. It makes for tricky plotting leaving you unsure who if anyone to root for particularly when youre watching actors were used to seeing as the kick-butt good guys. This comes to a head in a scene in which Danny and Spike are together in a room tied up both in dire straits but still at lethal odds with each other. I actually had this thought Who am I supposed to hope wins here? How can this possibly play out in a plausible way? The answer of course is simple It cant. Leaps of faith are more difficult to digest here than leaps through windows. Director Gary McKendry offers both in large measure for us to consider. But in ""Killer Elite"" its the latter thats more satisfying. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter twitter.com/goodyk.

After a collateral-damage close call awakens his conscience--the first of many perfunctorily recycled bits to come--hitman Danny Bryce (Jason Statham) retires only to be drawn back into business when his ex-partner (Robert De Niro) is kidnapped by a sheikh. To ransom his friend Danny has to kill members of the British SAS Special Forces who offed the sheikhs sons during the Dhofar Rebellion. As Danny tallies his kills hes tailed by SAS vet Spike (Clive Owen); both are duty-bound warriors well-matched to pummel each another in crisp and brutal dustups that make good use of Stathams human-bowling-ball physicality. Rather than these men--code-following samurai--the villains of Killer Elite are the corrupt boardroom shot-callers who pit them against one another suits who say things like ""We dont want blood on our pinstripes."" Or is the real villain screenwriter Matt Sherring also responsible for ""Killing is easy--living with its the hard part"" and ""Shit happens when you play in the deep end of the pool""?

Daily Edition Login to download Killer Elite Toronto Review 726 PM PDT 9/10/2011 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Efficient overly formulaic action piece could have been more distinctive but delivers the goods for solid international returns. TWITTER This muscular thriller--led by Jason Statham Clive Owen and Robert De Niro--strives to be a genuinely good film but unwilling to let go of proven formulas it falls short. Killer Elite is half-interested in being a legitimate exploration of the shadowy world of former British special forces operatives but remains too afraid not to supply the clockwork doses of rote action and violence presumably expected by Jason Stathams international audience. As if wanting to be a genuinely good film such as The Bank Job made by some of the same team but unwilling to let go of proven formulas this muscular thriller basically gets the job done but is not all it might have been given the intriguing source material. Macho marquee bait and loads of visceral chases and close combat should spell lively business especially overseas. ""Killing is easy. Living with it is the hard part"" says Stathams Danny who should know. A special-ops agent par excellence Danny and his mentor the aptly-named Hunter (Robert De Niro) show what theyre made of by pulling off a tricky motorized hit in the Mexico-set opening sequence. But when he cant bring himself to finish off a young kid whos traveling in the caravan Danny knows hes done and retires to an Australian farm where he hopes to leave the past behind. Fat chance. Some years later in the 1980s the trimly grizzled self-contained Danny is lured to Oman where Hunter is held by an aging tribal sheikh who will pay him 6 million--and free Hunter--if Danny will take out those responsible for the murders of three of his sons all of which have been helpfully illustrated in gratuitous and gratuitously violent flashbacks. Even after for the sake of another bloody action scene Danny tries to break Hunter out of the sheikhs grasp and kills several of his minions in the process the tribal chief still wants Danny to the job. But as with any suspense caper worth its salt there are very particular conditions The victims must confess on video to what they did and each killing must be pulled off in a different style to avoid the appearance of any connections between them. Thus starts the hunt with a first stop in Paris where Danny collects two cohorts the can-do ex-paratrooper Davies (Dominic Purcell) and the technically-minded Meier (Aden Young). The targets are all former members of Britains secretive Special Air Service who are protected by big shot senior veterans of the organization known as ""The Feather Men"" which was the title the controversial 1991 ""factional"" novel by explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes himself a former SAS man based in Oman for several years. Among the many omissions and changes from the book wrought by first-time screenwriter Matt Sherring and debuting director Gary McKendry is that the SAS was in Oman in the 1970s to (successfully) combat an East German and Soviet-backed communist insurgency operating out of South Yemen mention of which might have helpfully modified or at least made more complex the cartoonishly bad guy profile the SAS crew is given here. Its just one example of how the film adheres to a formula template rather than incorporating ironies ambiguities and social insights (as The Bank Job so nicely did) to enrich the material. So its best to lower expectations and enjoy the spectacle of Danny and his boys tracking and dispatching their victims which includes infiltrating an SAS training ground but more often involves the standard tropes of car chases shootings and brutal hand-to-hand combat. Dannys chief nemesis is the one-eyed assassin Spike (Clive Owen) a bloke so rough the prudent Feather Men eventually cast him off turning him into an ever-more-dangerous rogue agent. As the action skips around from the Middle East to London rural England and back to Paris with brief time-outs to idealize Dannys life back in Oz with his sexy ever-patient lady (Yvonne Strahovski) McKendry aims for bullet train speed most of the time which keeps things humming efficiently enough. But given that the plot is built around three main hits with a couple of bigger climaxes to follow whats missing is what often gives ""job"" movies their greatest distinction the methodical build-up to a mission that not only engrosses an audience in the minutia of a complex operation but mounts tension and suspense which Killer Elite fails to produce. Theres enough onscreen to distract and stimulate but little that grabs and takes you in. What you get then is reasonably well executed and sometimes imaginative brutality and action a vaguely intriguing but insufficiently detailed peek at the legacy of a dirty war and the questionable characters involved in it and an engaging display of three very different varieties of iconographic screen performers Statham the rugged man of minimal words always more ready to prove himself however reluctantly through action; Owen formidable crafty explosive never to be discounted and De Niro at this stage lovable for having nothing further to prove and by far the warmest guy onscreen. Theyre all fun to watch. By contrast some of the secondary characters could have been more vividly and recognizably cast for quicker and more resonant audience identification. And a quick script polish to produce a few memorable tough guy lines could only have helped. The film has no relation to Sam Peckinpahs 1975 feature The Killer Elite about American mercenaries and the CIA.

It takes a special kind of assassin to kill an assassin -- or so posits ""Killer Elite"" a macho adrenaline-fix suspenser that plays like the bigscreen equivalent of those pulpy spy novels that once clogged grocery-store checkouts. No surprise considering this well-oiled genre item was adapted from Ranulph Fiennes ""The Feather Men"" a fictionalized memoir -- or ""true adventure"" per his pubberys PR department -- in which a secret society mobilized to protect four British SAS vets marked for death. Pitting stubble against grizzle as Jason Statham and Clive Owen go head-to-head Open Roads first release has the makings of an international hit. With no connection to the Sam Peckinpah film of the same name ""Killer Elite"" instead mirrors the earnest approach to genre storytelling seen in ""The Bank Job"" as the same producers tap their bullet-headed star to topline another gritty period piece. After a showy public execution goes terribly wrong in Mexico ruthlessly efficient trigger man Danny (Statham) calls it quits and disappears on a farm deep in the Australian bush -- that is until a ""this time its personal"" twist calls him back in action His former partner Hunter (Robert De Niro) has been kidnapped by an Omani sheikh (Rodney Afif) who agrees to release him only if Danny does a little contract work pro bono. One of the reasons ""The Feather Men"" was considered scandalous upon initial publication was the way it exposed Britains secret involvement in Oman -- a dirty war against the spread of communism in the Middle East. ""Killer Elite"" rather hilariously depicts ex-SAS soldier Spike (Clive Owen) sitting at a table of fellow veterans. All but he have moved on to high-level business and banking jobs in the U.K. but they still meet from time to time for ... what tea and crumpets? ""What we did was questionable"" one growls thinking back to the embarrassing Oman business. ""No one wants blood on our pinstripes"" another concurs. So the sheikh orders Danny to kill the men responsible for murdering his sons demanding that he record on-camera confessions before easing them gently into that good night. Meanwhile these Feather Men -- so called because their touch at geopolitical puppet-mastery ""is light as a feather"" -- are sworn to protect the same chaps the sheikh wants dead. Clearly not all parties can get what they want which makes for some pretty solid pyrotechnics once Danny and his boys Davies (Dominic Purcell) and Meier (Aden Young) set to work arranging a series of grisly murders carefully designed to look like accidents. Coming off the artful intense Oscar-nominated short ""Everything in This Country Must"" director Gary McKendry brings a similar mix of nervous energy and polished technique to his feature debut selling the thrillers sillier moments -- as when Danny strapped to a chair escapes by somersaulting through an upstairs window -- via a combination of brisk pacing and sheer bravado. At its most hackneyed Matt Sherrings script recycles the idea of an assassin who swears hes seen enough killing for one lifetime to which an agent helpfully offers ""Yeah well maybe killing aint done with you."" According to the pics philosophy 2% of the population are natural killers. Danny has the gift and running away to the Australian outback (awkwardly written in to appease Oz producers Omnilab) wont cut it. Even there off the grid evil men can trace him leaving ominous warnings in the form of bullets on the pillow of his g.f. (Yvonne Strahovki ridiculously stunning to play a remote farm girl). Although Dannys crisis-of-conscience feels awfully insincere in a movie where all involved seem to love a good tussle it does serve to make his assignment slightly less off-putting. Between Danny Spike and the ex-SAS targets there are no good guys here just varying degrees of skill and ruthlessness. Strangely Fiennes himself factors in as a character -- the missions last target whose book the sheikh sees as a confession and whose execution serves as a perfect opportunity for Danny and Spike having already set the bar high in an earlier car chase-cum-fist fight to finally settle their differences. Auds will form their own allegiances according to which actor they prefer and McKendry satisfies both camps by making the two men more or less evenly matched. Room for a sequel is not only possible but likely with considerable care taken in finding exotic locations re-creating the 1980 period feel and delivering an overall muscular experience.
