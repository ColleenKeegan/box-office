An anxious American father is on the phone to his daughter when she and her friend are abducted from their Paris hotel. Her dream holiday was always his worst nightmare. Now that nightmare is real. He has 96 hours to save his daughter from being sold into prostitution. Pretty much what youd expect then except for one surprise the father an ex-government agent with a particular set of skills is played by heavyweight Liam Neeson. Neesons presence lends dramatic heft to a formulaic action movie that otherwise majors in chase scenes and the brutally efficient use of firepower martial arts fire extinguishers and broken bottles. The quest is simple as are the undeniable pleasures. Director Pierre Morels directing style is ruthlessly efficient but leaves no time to ponder the plot holes or the borderline racist portrayal of vicious Albanian gangsters and sleazy Arab businessmen.

Corrupt French Officers and evil Arabs involved in human trafficking. The film is actually quite bad. Liam Neesons character beats so many people up calling this film campy is actually a compliment. There isnt a stereotype this film doesnt employ. Poor but masculine father wife leaves him for a rich man. The daughter prefers her life with the rich step father but still loves her Daddy. The rich step father is impotent when the girl is taken and the real father a black ops specialist (played by Neeson) rescues his daughter despite a corrupt French Police force and an international ring of Arab terrorists involved in human trafficking. By the end of the film I couldnt stop laughing. Neesons character and his ability to beat everyone up is so unrealistic it makes old Van Damme movies seem plausible.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 19 2011DavidFeaturedThe idea that this film is racist is ridiculous. Racism wont go away if people keep bringing it up at a whim. Im sure if ALL the people in the film who were engaged in the sex trade were Americans there wouldnt have been a mention of racism.

"Taken | RichardRoeper.com BLOG On Camera RR YOUTUBE CHANNEL QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS Home    Movie Reviews    Taken Print Page Email Page Search Taken (2009; Rated ) C "" You just kidnapped the wrong teenager."" -Richard Roeper MOVIE INFORMATION Taken(2009; PG-13)In theaters Friday 30 January 2009 Summary A former spy relies on his old skills to save his estranged daughter who has been forced into the slave trade. Genre Action Crime Drama ThrillerDirector Pierre MorelCast Liam Neeson If they gave out Oscars for Best Poster and Best Telephone Monologue ""Taken"" would be the first contender of 2009 in both categories. If youve seen the trailers or the TV ads you have already seen the best moment in this film. Speaking on the phone to an unknown bad guy who has kidnapped his daughter Neeson says and I quote ""I dont know who you are. I dont know what you want. If youre looking for a ransom I can tell you I dont have any money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills acquired over a very long career in the shadows skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now that will be the end of it. I will not look for you I will not pursue you. But if you dont I will look for you I will find you. And I will kill you."" Yeah baby But wait. If you DO have such skills and someone overseas HAS taken your daughter and you ARE going to find him and kill him do you tell him all that? Unless your goal is to scare him off which hardly seems likely why go all Dirty Liam on him? That quibble is about the 467th most implausible thing about ""Taken"" an extremely well made and wildly jaw-droppingly astonishingly unbelievable thriller from producer Luc Besson who specializes in this sort of picture. (He directed ""The Professional"" one of the weirdest and one of the best hitman movies ever made.) Neeson gives this picture more weight than it deserves with a first-rate performance as Bryan Mills a former CIA operative who has retired so he move to Los Angeles and be near his 17-year-old daughter. Nice timing there as 17 is just about the age when kids are pining for college and want to spend as little time as possible with their parents. Maggie Grace is Kim Famke Janssen is the obligatory ex-wife who keeps reminding Bryan he was NEVER AROUND FOR ANYTHING EVER and Xander Berkeley is her new husband an obscenely wealthy guy who gives Kimmy a horse that looks like Secretariat in his prime for her birthday party which looks like something out of ""The Girls Next Door."" (Clueless Bryan shows up with a cheap karaoke machine.) Against Bryans better wishes Kim and her girlfriend go off to Paris----and within about 45 minutes of their arrival theyve been kidnapped by an evil cabal of Albanians who want to turn them into drug-addicted sex slaves. From one single recorded phone call with his daughter that transpired as the kidnappers close in on her Bryan and his CIA friends are able to determine the identities of the kidnappers the region in Albania where theyre from and much more. Hes even told he has just 96 hours to find her ""or shell be gone forever."" (Apparently Albanian sex-slave kidnapping rings have a deadline.) The rest of the film is Bryan tracking down the bad guys and causing mayhem all over Paris. He wrecks cars he blows up buildings he kills countless criminals and he uncovers massive corruption in the Paris police department even as he systematically makes his way to the villain behind the villains. How did the CIA ever let this guy retire? If theyd given him a cell phone a compass and gun he could have assassinated Hussein captured bin Laden and given Kim Jong-il a wedgie in about 30 days. Talk about a daddy-redemption film. Thanks to this crisis Bryan goes from pathetic afterthought to Mighty Mouse--""Here I come to saaaaaaave the day"" Theres got to be a part of him thats almost grateful his daughter was kidnapped just so he can make up for that whole karaoke machine debacle. There are multiple shootings in this film and some fairly intense scenes showing young girls who are forcibly addicted to drugs before theyre auctioned off like cattle. In one sequence Bryan casually tortures one of the bad guys. In another he pulls out a gun and shoots someone you do not expect to be shot. It seems like a completely unnecessary move and makes us wonder if super dad has completely lost it. With all that violence and all that intensity ""Taken"" still manages to snare a PG-13 rating. The MPAA is nothing if not consistent. If Maggie Grace (whos 25 and looks way too old to be playing the teen daughter) had done a topless scene if we had seen more blood if Bryan had resorted to the f-word ""Taken"" would have been hit with an R. But this is just slick loony escapist violence. No harm in that right?

In the violent churning and laughably derivative action bruiser Taken hes a suave power-knuckled and once-lethal secret agent named Bryan Mills who in truth is just as mean as 007 but maybe slightly more human (hes an ex-husband as well as a parent who loves his child unconditionally). And hes paid a price for his fists. Bryan once devoted so much concentration and energy to his job as a ""preventer"" (""I prevented bad things from happening"") that his wife (a wasted Famke Janssen who usually plays these roles herself) left him for a rich California businessman and took their daughter with them. So Bryan retired moved to Los Angeles to make up for the frayed relationship with his estranged daughter Kim and sacrificed his own career to be near her. All he does now is grill steaks for his buddies and work occasional security jobs like guarding pop stars at rock concerts. But old habits die hard and Bryan has forgotten none of the special skills he learned from his years with the C.I.A.--a knowledge of weapons wiretaps deciphering secret codes scaling buildings like Batman and wiping out anything that gets in his way without regret--if he suddenly needs them. When his virginal 17-year-old (huh? In L.A.?) embarks with her girlfriend on a whirlwind tour following the rock group U2 across Europe and within hours of her arrival in Paris gets kidnapped by Albanian white slavers Bryan shifts into demolition mode and takes no prisoners. He may be a has-been but within 96 hours hes torn down everything in Paris with his bare hands except the Eiffel Tower. First he leaves a message on the kidnappers cell phone which just happens to be lying under the bed where his daughter is hiding ""I will look for you. I will find you. And I will kill you."" He does of course but not before he slam-dunks his way through the City of Light turning it into darkness. Equipped with Uzis knives swords and even an electric chair Bryan works without official supervision or an expense account yet never seems to run out of steam or cash. And there is no limit to his ability to tap international phone lines spark the ignition in foreign cars without keys and find new ways to torture and kill his victims. In one scene when he fails to get the right answer from a man strapped to a chair in the middle of a brutal interrogation he electrocutes him filling the room with smoke fire and the smell of burning flesh. Each new victim (including some of Frances leading power players) only piques the simmering rage of a vengeful parent and we all know that a dangerous secret agent with a mission makes for panic in the streets. Turning the tables on master fiends police officials and their families ransacking Paris for clues Bryan ends up in a shootout on a luxury yacht on the Seine only minutes before Kim is to be raped by an Arab sheik who looks like Jabba the Hutt. To be generous its far-fetched to a fault. Worse still its all been done before. Moving from the theme of vigilante dad (Death Wish) to the strategies of slave traders who traffic girls into prostitution on Internet auctions (Trade) to the tragic spectacle of a scrupulous outsider who slides down the sinkhole of an alternate underworld universe of crime decadence and perversion (Paul Schraders Hardcore) this hack job has not a shred of originality. Liam Neeson is an unconventional choice to play an action hero. His big wrinkled smile is at dismaying odds with the lurid mayhem that surrounds him and how does a brawny American C.I.A. operative account for that lyrical Irish accent? In the end nobody is called to task for the bodies that litter the streets of Paris the automobiles and real estate that lie in rubbish left behind or the heroin injections that have mysteriously worn off leaving Kim heading home to a career as a rock star. Taken is the kind of exploitative junk everyone expects from no-talent French hack Luc Besson who made the dreadful Transporter films although this time out hes only the producer and the co-writer of the moronic script leaving the ossified direction to Pierre Morel. After this horror you might think twice about sending a teenager to Paris without a chaperone but it could be worse. She might end up in a movie like Taken. rreedobserver.com Comment Filed under Famke Janssen Liam Neeson Maggie Grace movie On the Town Taken Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture The Man Who Made Blue Oyster Cult RIP Producer Sandy Pearlman Culture Breaking Miamis Wynwood Arts District Is a Hotbed for Zika Politics Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://www.observer.com/2009/o2/dads-gone-wild,200,taken3,taken,observer

By Anthony Lane Share Tweet Table of Contents Razvan Vasilescu and Armand Assante face off in a Romanian village. Credit Illustration by Owen Smith On August 25 2006 a Romanian named Cristian Nemescu was killed in a car crash at the age of twenty-seven. He was returning from an editing suite where he had been working on a cut of ""California Dreamin."" This was Nemescus first feature as a director and we will never know exactly how the finished film would have looked; the regret though deep is not all-consuming because ""California Dreamin "" bears almost no trace of the tyro. It could use a trim but only rarely does it strain for effect and for a young man Nemescu was uncannily versed in the emotions of middle age--free-floating rancor the creak of unhelpful wisdom and a covetous sigh at the spectacle of lust. If its regret you want dont mourn the director; just watch his movie. The year is 1999 during the conflict in Kosovo and the place is Constanta Romania on the Black Sea. A platoon of American marines has arrived with a shipment of military radar to be deployed near the Serbian border in support of air raids by the NATO coalition. The plan is to put the equipment on a train and escort it across Romania hardly an errand to perplex the guy in charge Captain Jones (Armand Assante). Thats what he thinks. On a sleepy summers day the train grinds into a railroad station in the village of Capalnita at the back end of nowhere to be met by the devil incarnate. His name is Doiaru (Razvan Vasilescu) he is the stationmaster and like all the best Beelzebubs he doesnt look the part. With his lined and grizzled face poised to crease into a smile he could be the gentlest of patriarchs; but the man is a beast who has built up a black market terrorized the other villagers and brought a nearby factory to its knees. He loves his daughter Monica (Maria Dinulescu) a sullen beauty of seventeen but his love--or as she sees it his dread of being alone--vents itself as a fearsome wish to control. No wonder she longs to cut loose. And here comes her chance a herd of American boys as dazed and horny as bullocks in the wrong pasture. They expect a brief halt instead of which they linger for five days and browse among the locals. This is because Doiaru uncouples the engine and demands customs documentation which nobody seems able to provide. Single-handed in other words he blocks the progress of American might and why? A succession of haunting flashbacks to his own boyhood in the Second World War when he waited for Allied help that never came suggests a possible cause but Vasilescus earthy performance tells of something more stubbornly rooted a force of ill will which cannot abide the good will of others. The irony is that in stopping the train he sets off a burst of everything he loathes friendship zeal and the fireworks of desire. The mayor of Capalnita spotting a chance to put his little kingdom on the map invites the troops to a barbecue party where he wears a Stars and Stripes tie. We even get an Elvis impersonator crooning ""Love Me Tender"" in a Romanian burr. There is nothing new of course in the comedy of the backwater that gets swamped by the mainstream or by a gush of good fortune but even films as winning as ""Whisky Galore"" or ""Local Hero"" didnt dare to propose that the backwater itself might be corrupted and crazed with boredom whereas one father in Capalnita tells his son to flee to Bucharest and threatens to break his legs if he ever comes back. When Captain Jones takes the stage at a village meeting at the mayors request he describes the place as paradise. The elders applaud but you know what their juniors would say. So busily and wittily does Nemescu show these characters striking their various political attitudes (there is a hapless intrusion from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) that the film has no time to get locked into an attitude of its own. What it has instead is an appetite for human quiddity and an eye for those fleeting shocks in which cultures strike and rebound. To this extent it is Monica not her father who is at the movies heart; having conceived a passion for Joness handsome deputy Sergeant McLaren (Jamie Elman) she gets an English-speaking classmate--who happens to adore her--to interpret the bashful endearments that she and the sergeant wish to trade. The result is a masterly international update of the Cyrano situation. (""I would like to kiss you"" is translated as ""He wants to know what kind of music you listen to."") On the one hand Monica is impetuous to the point of brusque; when that kiss comes his lips draw near for a tentative peck and she practically jumps down his throat. On the other hand taking a cue from Nemescu she is wise beyond her years and fully aware that McLaren is not an escape route but a midsummer crush. At the end with the train finally set to leave he begs her to write her phone number on his hand; having watched her recede into the night he opens his palm and finds that she has scrawled a childish sun. She has loved him tender but let him go; the whole film you might say--raunchy and delicate endlessly alive to the dashing of hope--is a study in arrivals and departures. Hurrying back to the village Monica finds it in uproar with her father under attack. If ever the Americans were needed now is the time; but Jones and his men are gone. The conundrum posed by ""Taken"" is as old as cinema itself. Do stars degrade themselves when they take a role in trash or does their very presence redeem the folly turning up something that glitters amid the dross? A trenchcoated Robert Mitchum for instance sauntered through the villainous Europe of ""Foreign Intrigue"" (1956) but his saunter is pretty much all that remains; the rest of the movie was forgettable to start with. Now we have another looming hulk Liam Neeson laying similar waste to a posse of un-American scoundrels. Like Mitchum Neeson has shoulders so wide that you have to inspect the back of his jacket to make sure that he didnt leave the coat hanger in. Like Mitchum too he appears to move slowly at his noble leisure yet to act with daunting swiftness when the occasion demands. He is more alert than Mitchum whose brand of cool verged on the narcoleptic but both men lord it over their surroundings--not with a wink but with a bang. Why spoof the world when you can wreck it with a straight face? In ""Taken"" Neeson plays a former C.I.A. hand named Bryan Mills who is divorced from his wife (Famke Janssen) and living in Los Angeles to be near his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). If theres one thing weve learned from ""California Dreamin"" its that seventeen-year-old daughters get into scrapes. And if theres one thing weve learned from ""24"" its that anybody named Kim with a father schooled in dirty work by the U.S. government will have a large echo chamber where her brain is meant to be. Kim and a friend leave for a vacation in Europe where ignoring the advice of her father they are abducted with such consummate speed that it might have been simpler if he had FedExed them directly to the kidnappers. Pausing only to borrow a private jet from his exs slimy husband Mills flies to Paris where he proceeds to work his way without mercy through a personal alphabet of undesirable aliens. This being a brisk affair of little more than ninety minutes he gets only as far as Albanians and Arabs but if I were an innocent Bermudan let alone a Belgian I would be starting to get nervous about a sequel. The producer and co-writer is Luc Besson and the director is Pierre Morel who made the superior ""District B13."" That had Paris under its fingernails whereas ""Taken"" darts from one location to the next without probing the city that lies between the hot spots although Neeson would argue that once you learn to drive like a Parisian the opportunities for sightseeing tend to flash past. His performance is the most perturbing thing in the film even more so than its electrical-torture sequence or its revelations about sex-trafficking; Mills like some older vaster brother of Daniel Craigs James Bond seems driven to--or increasingly driven by--acts of vengeance that are only obliquely related to the wrong that is being avenged. The chop and swipe of his forearms with or without a knife become as mechanical as the hammer blows of a blacksmith and the point at which he casually shoots a friends wife (who has invited him to stay for supper) in order to extract information from the friend is either proof of Millss own madness or at best a thoughtful critique of the decline in domestic French cuisine. True the friend has turned out to be false but that in itself is a startling development with Morel and Besson presumably happy to present their native land as not merely spiced with imported peril but intrinsically treacherous. Someone no doubt is already composing a thesis on ""Symbolic paranoia and American foreign policy in mid-period Neeson"" and you do wonder how this commanding actor--who carries so much more conviction than the plot--felt about delivering the line ""Ill tear down the Eiffel Tower if I have to."" The movie opened in France almost a year ago; was it wise to delay its release here until the dawn of the new Presidency when it so clearly belongs to the last one?

Its a bad world out there he insistsa bad bad world. You dont know. I know. Believe me. Ive seen things. You dont want to know. Dismissing him as a hysteric Kim jets to France and is promptlyI mean she doesnt get to peesnatched by Albanian sex-slavers for sale to sheikhs and sundry other wealthy sadists. This is where Dad gets to prove that he can karate-chop the windpipe of one Albanian while taking out three more with a paper clip a wad of gum and a hard stare. (I exaggerate but not by much.) The script by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen panders to macho American wet dreams that feel distinctly antiquated in the new age of American non-exceptionalism. And in a just universe the idea that rich white American virgins are the prime targets of sex-slavers would make tens of thousands of captive underage Asian girls rise up shouting That is the last straw I would leave it there except that Takenin the hands of director Pierre Morel (District B13) with Neeson in nearly every shotworks like gangbusters. The Frenchies have made the filet mignon of meathead vigilante movies.Morel stages the action so cleanly that even when it hurtles by fastalmost too fast for the naked eyethe killings have a satisfying snap. Theres no fussy slo-mo no vulgar splatter just blasts breaking bones and baddies who barely hit the floor before the hero has moved on to the next Albanian wave. But its the big dolorous Neeson who makes the movie a keeper. He does not gloat he does not preen. But neither is he a blank terminator. His motivation is clear He wants his daughter back. (Whats your motivation Liam? I want my daughter back.) As he gives instructions over the phone to Kim cowering under a bed as Albanian footsteps approach his focus is uncanny. He is stripped down to pure righteous patriarchal American genius. -- David Edelstein Advertisement Top 10 Movies Star Trek Beyond The Secret Life of Pets Ghostbusters Lights Out Ice Age Collision Course Finding Dory The Legend of Tarzan Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates Hillarys America The Secret History of the Democratic Party The Infiltrator Advertising On The Set of Jill Soloways I Love Dick Outcast Recap Sympathy For the Devil The Great British Baking Show Recap Rough Puff The Great British Baking Show Recap Lady Fingers TV Review BoJack Horseman Gucci Mane Is Better Than Hes Been in Years Absolutely Fabulous The Movie Is Only Semi-Fab Copyright (c) 2016 New York Media LLC.

In ""Taken"" Liam Neeson plays a former government operative named Bryan Mills whose daughter is kidnapped while vacationing in Paris. Bryan calls himself a ""preventer."" As he explains he ""prevented bad things from happening."" Its too bad he could not have prevented ""Taken"" from being made.Bryan has 96 hours (dont ask) to rescue his daughter (Maggie Grace) before she gets sold into white slavery. (Arabs of course are the ultimate buyers.) No one can accuse Bryan of slacking off. He spends most of his time hacking carjacking slicing dicing garroting and torching. And hes the good guy. In one particularly repellent scene he casually shoots the wife of a former covert op confrere in order to force him to talk. Apparently she only suffers a flesh wound. Bryan even apologizes. Thanks for that.Somewhere along the line A-list stars like Daniel Craig Matt Damon and now Neeson decided that action heroes should be played as seething dead-faced killers. This new house style derived mostly from Bourne and his derivatives is presented as the ultimate cool. And because these men are ostensibly just the filmmakers can have it both ways - they exult in righteousness while piling on the mayhem. Dont be taken in by ""Taken.""

And hes using all means necessary to get her back. ABOUT THE MOVIETaken  1/2 out of four Stars Liam Neeson Maggie Grace Famke Janssen Xander BerkeleyDirector Pierre MorelDistributor 20th Century FoxRating PG-13 for intense sequences of violence disturbing thematic material sexual content some drug references and languageRunning time 1 hour 33 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Since when did a couple of dozen brutal murders torture and sex slavery qualify a movie for a PG-13 rating? Because of that inappropriate assessment by the MPAA parents might be tempted to bring their 10-year-olds to see Taken. Dont do it. What might be a guilty pleasure for adult fans of revenge thrillers could be deeply disturbing to an adolescent. At the very least it might make a kid never want to travel abroad. Taken does have a few things going for it. At the top of that short list is Liam Neeson in the starring role. Hes not just capable hes an almost superhuman middle-aged menace Think Jason Bourne crossed with MacGyver. The plot is preposterous and Neeson smites faceless bad guys with implausible finesse and immeasurable violence. But somehow because of the Irish actors gravitas we kind of buy it. Some of that is from the movies breathless pacing and slickness. But when you stop and think about it much of it is absurd. Neeson is Bryan Mills a former CIA operative who has retired to be closer to his daughter Kim (Losts Maggie Grace). Despite no longer being on the job he has retained his hefty arsenal of espionage skills. He also appears to be prescient sensing that when Kim 17 asks to travel to Paris with her friend Amanda (Katie Cassidy) something terrible is going to happen. To that end he gives her a specially wired cellphone. And sure enough just hours after they arrive Kim and her friend are abducted. He hops the next plane and is told that if he doesnt find her in 96 hours he probably never will. He quickly learns that she has been kidnapped by Albanian immigrants who run a sex slavery ring. The films paranoid and xenophobic subtext is troubling. Bryan disposes of a slew of evildoers who have heavy accents tracking them down through various clever methods. With some suspension of disbelief and a strong stomach its possible to get taken in or at least absorbed by this adrenaline-pumping action thriller.

"Taken Bracingly effective thriller | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsTaken Bracingly effective thrillerLiam Neeson flashes a telltale Harrison Ford smirk a couple of times near the start of Taken  which helps explain why this bracingly effective thriller is getting the January cast-off treatment.Bryan (Liam Neeson) goes on extended tear in Taken.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Jan. 30 2009 Taken (out of 4)Starring Liam Neeson Maggie Grace Famke Janssen and Olivier Rabourdin. Directed by Pierre Morel. At major theatres. 14A Liam Neeson flashes a telltale Harrison Ford smirk a couple of times near the start of Taken which helps explain why this bracingly effective thriller is getting the January cast-off treatment.The film has already been released almost everywhere else but North America - it first opened in France last February - and the major critical knock is that it looks like something Ford would have done 20 years ago. Something like Frantic in fact the 1988 movie in which Fords character rousts Paris in search of his kidnapped wife.The comparisons are apt - Neesons character rips through Paris for his kidnapped daughter - but youll miss out on a good movie if you consider Taken just another January dumping.Its more of a thumping as Neeson lays bare his action-hero chops. The quiet Irishman doesnt often get a chance to go on an extended tear but when he does you need to sit back and watch in amazement.Hes ex-CIA ""preventer"" Bryan Mills who has recently moved to Los Angeles from Virginia to be more of a dad to his 17-year-old daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). His dedication to his job cost him his marriage to Kims mother Lenore (Famke Janssen) and hes trying to make up for parental lost time.Lenore isnt buying it and shes now happily involved with a tycoon (Xander Berkeley) who is so determined to spoil Kim he even buys her a pony. It does seem that Bryan is having trouble leaving the rough life behind he busts a few moves and heads while on a freelance protection job for a pop diva (Holly Valance).Bryans knuckles and pistols more than come in handy though when Kim and her pal Amanda (Katie Cassidy) travel to Paris on vacation against Bryans better judgment and are immediately kidnapped. Bryan learns from his former CIA pals that the girls have been snatched by Albanian pimps who seek slave prostitutes and theres a window of no more than 96 hours before the teens disappear into the underworld forever.A ticking clock within a thriller usually means a bomb is about to go off and that accurately describes Bryan. To say that he hits the ground running is almost an insult to physics. He is the Tasmanian Devil of trackers. Do not doubt him when he calmly tells the kidnappers via Kims purloined cellphone ""I will look for you. I will find you. And I will kill you.""The bodies stack up like jets at a busy airport as Bryan gets down to brutal business improvising as he goes. Neeson has a marvellously expressive face that contains rage like a bottled tornado. He also conveys the empathy needed for us to endure lots of violence and unfortunate ethnic stereotypes (Arabs are particularly maligned) of this blunt instrument of a film. Who couldnt identify with a fathers determination to save his daughter?Taken is from Luc Bessons genre factory which explains why France got it first and why it bristles with energy. It also reveals the lineage of Pierre Morel who capably directed and Robert Mark Kamen who co-wrote with Besson. Morel has been the cinematographer for Bessons high-octane The Transporter franchise and Kamen is Bessons favoured screenwriting partner. The films frenetic pace which really picks up when the action moves to Paris keeps us from thinking too much about things such as why the Parisian cops ignore Bryans habit of driving the wrong way on one-way streets. The only gendarme who really pays attention to Bryan not always for the better is his old French intelligence comrade Jean-Claude (Olivier Rabourdin).The choice of Neeson for the lead elevates the material. Time was when Neeson was considered for the role of James Bond.He would have made good use of the proverbial licence to kill although 007s lady-killing antics might have been a stretch.He would also have made a dandy Jason Bourne. At the ripe old age of 56 Neeson retains the physical attributes to arm-wrestle Matt Damon for the role along with the actors grace to make us want him to do just that.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

We see a guy elude his pursuer by jumping from a highway onto the street below and as he stands up unhurt get whacked by a truck that neither he nor the audience saw coming. Kudos to the stunt team for what could be the finest-ever twist on a standard action-movie bit of business. The second best part of Taken is a phone message the movies hero Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) leaves for the man who has just kidnapped his 17-year-old daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). ""I dont know who you are"" Bryan says his voice icy with a strong mans resolve. ""I dont know what you want. If you are looking for ransom I can tell you I dont have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now thatll be the end of it. I will not look for you I will not pursue you. But if you dont I will look for you I will find you and I will kill you."" Ba-dump. (See TIMEs top 10 film performances of 2008.) Befitting a B-minus exploitation film that steely speech is in the 30-sec. TV spot that sold Taken as a smart thriller and that will probably land the movie at No. 1 for the weekend. But if a movies high points are a quick smack of carnage and a steely speech that everyones already seen in the trailer you know it must be January. Thats the time of year when no film is bad enough to go direct to DVD and studios dump their slag on a public eager to flee from all those high-minded Oscar contenders and see a real movie. Taken could have been a real movie and a good one. It spices its torture-porn premise -- a man trying to save his daughter from being peddled as the tender meat in a white-slave ring -- with Neesons stolid solid presence. But the film promises so much more than it delivers that by the end I felt like registering a complaint with the Obama Administrations consumer-protection squad. Silly me Id been looking forward to Taken in part because it was directed by Pierre Morel whose previous film was District 13 a fast-n-brutal half-classic crime movie highlighting the art of parkour. Thats the working-class-thug form of gymnastics that sends athletic young men hurtling over roofs through transoms and down staircases all without the aid of a digital art brush. Morel a cinematographer directing his first feature kept things moving and snarling with a scuzzy brio and made expert use of the artless screen presence of the leading men (one a stunt man the other a co-creator of parkour). The picture barely broke 1 million at the North American box office but you can bet the makers of the Bourne and Bond films were watching. Both Morel movies were produced and co-written by Luc Besson whos a one-man French film industry. He earned his early rep as a writer-director with Subway a vivacious crime melodrama then made the Hollywood-influenced thrillers La Femme Nikita and The Professional (which introduced Natalie Portman) and the Bruce Willis sci-fi hit The Fifth Element. Rarely directing movies anymore hes produced nearly 70 of them this decade most set in Paris many in English including the Transporter series and a couple of Jet Li action adventures. Besson is Hollywood in another way on a continent where subsidized moviemaking is the norm -- something like 70% of the average European films budget is ponied up by government agencies -- Besson proudly takes no handouts. So Im a big Besson fan theoretically. The script which this non-Luc Godard wrote with Robert Mark Kamen quickly sketches Bryan as your standard-issue CIA superman with a pathetic flaw. He calls himself a ""preventer."" (""What do you prevent?"" ""Bad things from happening."") And like most other action heroes hes an all-or-nothing-at-all fellow. An indifferent husband to Lenore (Famke Janssen this time looking less than her usual obscenely fabulous) whos remarried and cant stand him Bryan is trying to redeem himself as a family man by paying extra attention to his daughter. Mix in one psychological wrinkle Bryan has a smothering love for Kim that stops just this side of the unnatural. Hes quit his CIA job to be near her; he buys her gifts more suitable for a 12-year-old; he hovers galoot-like around her less a sensible parent than the nerd next to her in chemistry class. He wants her to be Daddys little girl always and exclusively and his devotion to Kim has made him her imaginary swain and something like her real-life stalker. Message to Bryan Get your own girlfriend. These roiling undercurrents are hard to miss but the movie and Neeson seem unaware of them. What they do understand are the conventions of the genre. And one is that when an action hero warns his daughter about imminent danger -- say the potential perils of spending the summer in Paris with a classmate -- Papa knows whereof he preacheth. Perhaps some angel has whispered to him that if the girls did just go safely museum-hopping it wouldnt be a Luc Besson movie. But Bryan may also have noticed that Kim and her pal Amanda (Katie Cassidy) left to their own devices share that special mixture of naivete and curiosity that makes them idiots. Before theyve even gotten out of Charles de Gaulle Airport they have blithely given their Paris address to a suspiciously friendly fellow who in short order dispatches some rough types there to kidnap the girls. The second message of this French-made film Dont trust the French. Bryan is on the next flight to Paris and the rest of the movie follows him as he combs the citys lower-rent arrondissements in search of first the Albanian nasties who abducted Kim and ultimately the movers and sheiks who will pay handsomely for the privilege of deflowering her. But to elevate Bryan to preternatural status all his adversaries must be dim-brained klutzes who cant shoot straight. (He rarely takes on fewer than five at a time.) He also must leave Paris in rubble and his old friendships in shambles. Busting into the home of two such friends a French police chief and his wife Bryan shoots the woman in the arm then threatens to finish her off with a bullet between the eyes unless the policeman does his bidding. If Morel hadnt stranded his cast in dialogue scenes with lumpy rhythms and action choreography that has a low plausibility factor Id guess that Taken means to be a critique of a man as fascinated by his daughters endangered purity as her predators are -- and by extension of the thriller genres obsessive hero. Back in the 70s a cop film mined the similarities between the man with the badge and the criminal he hunted. That was The French Connection whose wary sympathy for and expose of the cop played by Gene Hackman won the movie an Oscar for Best Picture. But this actual French movie has nothing more on its mind than dozens of bad guys getting beat up and another one turned into instant roadkill.

In this image released by 20th Century Fox Liam Neeson is shown in a scene from ""Taken."" Photo Stephanie Branchu AP Movie review Taken keeps on giving 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Taken Action thriller. Starring Liam Neeson Maggie Grace and Olivier Rabourdin. Directed by Pierre Morel. (PG-13. 94 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) So many movies are well intended but poorly made that when something like ""Taken"" comes along its a relief almost a joy. Theres nothing lofty in the intentions of ""Taken."" The aspiration here was to make a simple straight-ahead action thriller. Period. But if you think thats easy think of all the lousy action thrillers that come out in the course of a year. The level of skill that went into ""Taken"" is masterly. This is a picture that will appeal mainly to people who love movies and I use the word ""love"" advisedly. Viewers who love movies for their true soul - for their obviousness for their manipulations for their corniness for their blend of high and low emotion - will take great pleasure in ""Taken."" Others who like movies conditionally like a wayward lover they hope to reform may end up hating ""Taken"" - or at least thinking of it as something stupid ridiculous far-fetched and worthless. Which reminds me of a story When I was 6 all the kids I knew used to watch the TV show ""Batman."" We took it very very seriously. Then at around 7 we realized it was ridiculous. Then when we were around 9 we realized it was intended to be ridiculous and we liked it again. At 7 we thought we were quite sophisticated but it turned out there were higher levels of appreciation. ""Taken"" requires that higher level of appreciation. In terms of pace and economy its beautiful to behold. Director Pierre Morel working from a script by Robert Mark Kamen (""The Fifth Element"") and Luc Besson knows when to slow down and lavish time on characters to establish the emotions and motivations that are going to give the action its urgent undercurrent. Liam Neeson plays Brian a nice easygoing fellow whose main mission in life as the film starts is to rekindle a relationship with his teenage daughter. Apparently he was a workaholic who neglected his family and wrecked his marriage but hes determined to keep that one flickering connection alive and thriving. Oh yes and it turns out that hes a former CIA agent. Of course he is. What did you think that this movie was going to be some boring thing about a family? Wake up and smell the explosions So what happens next? How do the screenwriters connect the dedicated-father angle with the former CIA-agent angle? Three guesses. ... What you only needed one guess? Thats right the daughter is taken and borne away by an international cabal of criminals. Anyone could devise this premise. The real measure of ""Taken"" is not in what happens but in how it happens. Observe for example the intelligent construction of the abduction scene. Notice how the design of the apartment (from which the girl is taken) and the use of the victims perspective contribute to the tension. Take note of the sheer cleverness of the filmmakers choosing to have it all happen while the girl is on the phone and how that phone conversation builds the sense of dread and excitement. Its as if the filmmakers at every turn of the script said ""OK this is how its usually done. Lets come up with a way thats better. Then lets throw that out and come up with something thats even better than that."" There are different kinds of creativity. ""Taken"" evinces the creativity of expert craftsmanship. Neeson is well cast as a softhearted thoughtful self-effacing man who is big enough to do serious damage once he gets angry. Hes angry for most of the movie which incidentally takes place mainly in Paris. The placement of an archetypal American character the avenging action hero wreaking havoc through the Paris streets has some dark appeal No one at the tourist information booth is going to be rude to this guy. Then its over and a glance at the watch shows that only 94 minutes have gone by and yet so much has happened. I wont tell you ""Taken"" is great but its great fun. -- AdvisoryStrong action violence and near nudity. To hear Mick LaSalle talk about movies listen to his weekly podcast at sfgate.com/podcasts.

But when Dad is an ex-CIA agent and his little girl is abducted within hours of touching down in Paris its time for some serious parental intervention. And so with a 96-hour window before Kim (Maggie Grace) disappears forever into a sordid underworld of Albanian sex traffickers Bryan Mills - Liam Neeson making a surprisingly good action hero - flies from the City of Angels to the City of Light to track his offspring. And of course he must teach her slimeball kidnappers a thing or two. A fleet no-nonsense rescue thriller from the crackerjack French director Pierre Morel Taken is satisfying (1) for the Gaelic gravitas of its star (2) its slam-bang chase scenes and bone-snapping martial arts and (3) the scenic backdrops (the Seine the cafes the swank apartments) of its bustling Paris locale. Its not every movie where the cop-in-charge carries a gun in one hand and a baguette in the other. Vive la France. Cowritten and produced by Luc Besson the Gallic filmmaker whose penchant for sleek Hollywood-style shoot-em-ups produced La Femme Nikita The Professional and The Transporter series Taken begins somewhat in the vein of er Last Chance Harvey. That is with a pathetic excuse for a father trying to make up for his years of absence and neglect watching helplessly from the sidelines while his ex-wife and her new husband pour on the love. Its Kims birthday and Bryan retired from the life of a covert op - a ""preventer"" he calls his old job - to be close at hand proudly brings a karaoke machine as his gift to the big party. But then his replacement a moneyed mogul who has taken ownership so to speak of Bryans spouse and child trots out his present to his step-daughter a horse. Famke Janssen is Lenore Kims mom and Bryans ex and she gets a few lectures in before the fateful cellphone call that sets Taken in motion. From then on the admonishments and bickering go out the window - and Bryan goes running down the boulevards in pursuit of thugs and pimps sex traders depraved sheiks and crooked gendarmes. Our heros high-tech software and his network of former colleagues with satellite capabilities makes for a couple of too-convenient shortcuts. Is it really possible to pinpoint the hometown of an Albanian sleaze by the nuances of his accent? And is there only one building with a red door on all of Rue Paradis in Paris 10th arrondissement? But no matter - far-fetched plot points are the inevitable by-product of a good gripping thriller (and bad ones too). And director Morel makes up for the implausibilities with deftly choreographed fights and gear-ripping car chases. Neeson buff and all-business is up to the task. Theres a xenophobic element to Takens premise to be sure - the idea that travel even to Western Europe isnt safe for Americans and that foreigners (Albanians Arabs) are by nature shifty and sinister. ""Mom said your job made you paranoid"" Kim says to her father as hes driving her to LAX for the flight to France. ""My job made me aware"" Bryan corrects her. Yes. And made it possible for Taken to take off. Taken  (out of four stars) Directed by Pierre Morel. With Liam Neeson Maggie Grace Famke Janssen and Katie Cassidy.

Print Email Star-Ledger Staff By Star-Ledger Staff The Star-Ledger on January 29 2009 at 1000 PM updated January 29 2009 at 1018 PM comments STEPHANIE BRANCHUIn Taken Liam Neeson stars as Bryan Mills an ex-government operative who has less than four days to find his kidnapped daughter. Taken. (PG-13) Fox (91 min.) Directed by Pierre Morel. With Liam Neeson. Now playing in New Jersey. TWO STARS. A quick quiz He is a retired CIA hard guy with an adored teenage daughter a seething ex-wife and occasional security gigs. Then one day his vacationing child is abducted -- and its time for Daddy to un-retire. Now the quiz Name the year studio signature line and star. OK times up. If you said 1982 Cannon Films ""Its personal"" and Sly Stallone -- well one day I would have given you the prize. But actually todays answers are 2009 Fox ""Its personal"" -- and Liam Neeson. The dustily retro feel of ""Taken"" isnt complete -- the villains are called ""sex traffickers"" not ""white slavers"" and the editing is often dizzily fast. Yet the movie still feels like a trip back to those days of Sly Arnie and ""international"" productions. Women are decorative or destructive virgins or whores. Assault weapons are everywhere and explosions happen easily. Unknown actors fill the supporting cast and swarthy foreigners play the baddies. Our hero of course takes on everyone single-handedly. As directed by Pierre Morel -- the auteur behind the lively ""B13"" and a protege of the manic Luc Besson -- the movie rarely stops to catch its breath or even make sense. The plot holes could swallow Renaults and the whole thing begins to fade with the final credits. Best is when Neeson -- whose CIA skills include not only being able to quickly forge ID cards but even find medical supplies in the middle of the night -- decides to pass himself off as a French policeman. And sure would you not think someone might be noticing his accent? Some movies flirt with absurdity. ""Taken"" takes it to bed and then out for waffles in the morning. Not that there isnt a basic pleasure in watching traffickers get knocked around. As an overprotective Irish father of a teenage girl I found some satisfaction in seeing this overprotective Irish father proven right. You see what happens when you dont phone home regularly? You see? Still its a little odd to watch the generally thoughtful and genuinely mild Neeson in all of this. Isnt this the sort of grim American hero Harrison Ford is supposed to play brushing aside incompetent Europeans and going after sleazy villains? Its hard to imagine Neeson was the producers first choice (or that doing the film was his). Things get particularly odd when the electric cables come out for a torture scene and he complains about how difficult it is to get a really steady power supply in Third World countries. And then snaps on the switch and leaves the fellow twitching. Whatever Neesons reasons here he is driving his truck through double-wide trailers giving the slip to the French police shooting literally dozens of interchangeable henchman and finally facing down the porcine Arab pervert behind it all. Here we are watching it all over again. Rating note The film contains extreme violence drug abuse and sexual material. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

""Taken"" one of those Frenchy efforts to do an American-style chase-em-down and shoot-em-up comes from formerly respectable producer Luc Besson and director Pierre Morel whose homegrown low-budget action thriller ""District B13"" was a lively little collection of stunts. In trying to broaden their scale to interest a big American audience Besson and Morel are as convincing as Marcel Marceau doing John Wayne. Neeson plays a retired ex-spook trying to mend fences with the teen daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) he had with his ex-wife (Famke Janssen) who is still bitter about being neglected during his career as an international undercover agent. We learn that Neesons Bryan left his teammates in the middle of a mission in Beirut so he could fly 9000 miles to attend one of his daughters birthday parties. So which is it Was he distant or dedicated? And why do his ex-mates think hes such a great guy if he disappears every time he wants to go wrap a present? Bryan is a growly killin machine trying to find his daughter after she is kidnapped on a trip to Paris. To find his way he uses a road map of cliches moldy dialogue (""I will find you. And I will kill you"") improbable escapes from teams of incompetent henchmen (just shoot him in the head guys - dont handcuff him to a loose overhead pipe) and one of those only-in-the-movies sofas that is bulletproof and fluffy at the same time. When the machine guns roar just get behind one of these babies and watch the air fill with soft pretty flurries of stuffing. Available at Crate amp; Gunbarrel. The movie has two tasks One is to track Neesons every step as he pieces together the mystery of where his daughter is. The other is to stage cool chases and gunfights. Both the action and the mystery scenes though are made up of such choppy sloppy laugh-till-you-drop-y elements that I couldnt figure out whether the movie was rushing through the fights to get back to the mystery or vice versa. An example of how the mystery plays out Bryan plays a tape of a snippet of conversation between his daughters attackers to one of his fellow spies. The spy tells him that the men are speaking Albanian identifies what town theyre from guesses what their game is (trafficking in women to turn into prostitutes) and even explains who their crime boss is. I wish I had a Basil Exposition of my own to decode Neesons accent. The Irish actor chews over his words as though speaking through a mouthful of mashed potatoes. After half an hour it dawned on me that he might be trying to sound American although I couldnt be sure. ""You need my permission to leave the coontry?"" he asks. The fights and chases are so scrambled that its hard to figure out basics such as where objects are in relation to one another. Which of the many white SUVs at the construction site is Bryan driving? Where are the other SUVs? Never mind - what I really want to know is where do the bad guys get these bullets that when fired at the driver-side window shatter the glass but stop before reaching the drivers head? TAKEN Half a star Mistaken. Running time 90 minutes. Rated PG-13 (action violence sexuality drug abuse profanity). At the E-Walk the Lincoln Square the Magic Johnson others.

(Europa Corp.) Joe Neumaier Thursday January 29 2009 530 PM An ex-government operative searches Paris for his kidnapped daughter. With Liam Neeson Famke Janssen. Director Pierre Morel (133). PG-13 Violence gunplay. At area theaters.Theres a gloominess at the heart of ""Taken"" a seamy action thriller from the hot-boiled mind of Luc Besson (""The Professional"" ""La Femme Nikita"") who co-wrote and produced it yet it has nothing to do with the plot. It has to do with Liam Neeson being forced into the service of an aging Harrison Ford role or a more highly evolved Sly Stallone vehicle.Neesons better than this. You cant watch him here without thinking Geez every fight-choreography session could have funded ""Love Actually."" This bash-the-door-down action scene likely took as long to film as ""Kinsey."" That gunfight required more stunts than all of ""Schindlers List.""Though Neeson has lent his gravitas to action films before -- acceptable (""The Phantom Menace"" ""Batman Begins"") and not (""The Haunting"") -- he seems hollowed out as Bryan Mills a former supersecret government operative who left his job in order to live in L.A. and be near his 17-year-old daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) much to the annoyance of his ex-wife (Famke Janssen). Mills former family has had it with his spy stuff and the only way he can get on to his daughters radar is by protecting a Mariah Carey-like singing star.When Kim is abducted by Albanian sex traffickers minutes after starting a vacation in Paris Mills uses his dormant surveillance and tough-guy abilities to find her. He searches sordid dens of sin until finally stumbling upon a tuxedoed villain selling victims to decadent clients.Putting aside how Janssens rollercoaster-shaped eyebrows pretty much define her harpy character and that the daughter is a ditz who were told wants to follow U2 around Europe (was she even born when ""Achtung Baby"" was released?) ""Taken"" is so filled with simpleton plot mechanics its not even fun to watch Mills Jack Bauer skill set come out. And then there are the questions Why would Mills dismiss the Albanian translator he has hired after literally minutes? Why wouldnt he grab the wallet of a suspect just hit by a car? And if Mills is such a jangle of nerves before his daughters trip why not put one of his handy-dandy tiny microphones on her coat as he drops her at the airport?Because the movie wouldnt exist thats why. Neeson goes through the paces but is of course better in real movies. Although maybe in Luc Bessons world its realistic when a survivor of this films horrific ordeals meets a pop star upon returning to the U.S. though posttraumatic stress counseling never enters anyones head.

Its not a persona that suits him.  |  out of 4 stars By Colin Covert Star Tribune August 14 2009 -- 758pm Photo Credit Stephanie Branchu/ Special to the Star Tribune Liam Neeson in Taken Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint How the mighty have fallen Liam Neeson trades his usual gravitas for a Charles Bronson role as the royally ticked-off father of a kidnapped teen in ""Taken."" After working for the likes of Martin Scorsese Steven Spielberg Bill Condon and Christopher Nolan Neeson signs on with pulp director Pierre Morel in a thriller where the body count is stratospheric and the IQ is subterranean. Made with a slick proficiency that could be mistaken for style the film deals in brain-rattling chases brawls torture and gun battles alongside images of sexually enslaved women that teeter on exploitation. Neeson plays Bryan a former secret agent whose globetrotting assignments alienated his ex-wife (Famke Janssen an ice sculpture of grim resentment). His 17-year-old Kim (Maggie Grace) now lives large in a Los Angeles mansion with mom and her millionaire stepfather and Bryan is an afterthought at her birthday party. When his little girl is snatched by Albanian sex-slavers on a visit to Paris Bryan leaps into action. He hits France like Jack Bauers dad beating up everyone who can offer a scrap of information. ""Taken"" plays by the rules of mindless action flicks. Machine guns never ever hit their objective. A speeding car that rams a building will burst through the walls unscathed and zoom on without so much as a flat tire. The best way to locate a loose pipe is to handcuff the hero to it. The villains are swarthy brutes and the big boss is a wicked sheik because a run-of-the-mill human trafficker wouldnt be evil enough. The violence turns edgy and disturbing when Neeson gets up close and personal with his adversaries. Stephanie Branchu Provided to the Star Tribune Liam Neeson in Taken Given the paternal nature of his vendetta Neesons CIA man is more ferocious than most film spies. He tortures suspects without compunction and even shoots an innocent woman to force her husband to talk. The film flirts with saying something dark and serious about pursuing justice through unjust means then quickly chickens out. Neeson is too committed an actor to mail in his performance but hes alone. Janssen is a one-dimensional harpy and Grace who hasnt been 17 for eight years conveys Kims youthful exuberance by squealing. But the film is less about the way actual human beings might respond to frightening crimes -- for that see ""Eastern Promises"" -- than about jiggle-cam cinematography and jumpy editing. ""Taken"" makes you feel like youve had of one of Neesons pistol whippings.

Taken (PG-13)  | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Taken (PG-13)  Get ready to be taken on one heck of ride. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald A word of caution to any teenage girls planning to spend their summer vacations in Europe Do not let your parents anywhere near Taken or risk being locked in your room with no hope of parole until youre 35. A parents worst nightmare writ large in flashing neon letters Taken centers on the abduction of two 17-year-old American tourists Kim (Maggie Grace) and Amanda (Katie Cassidy) mere hours after arriving in Paris for what was supposed to be a month-long trek following U2 around on tour through Europe. Fortunately Kims father Bryan (Liam Neeson) happens to be a retired ex-CIA agent one badass enough to make Jason Bourne and James Bond cower and beg for mercy -- at the same time. Bryan whose previous devotion to his career cost him his wife (Famke Janssen bristling with bitter resentment) and daughter was trying to make up for lost time when he reluctantly consented to allow Kim to jet overseas despite his apprehensions. Mom says your job made you paranoid Kim tells him as he drives her to the airport. My job made me aware he replies. So hes not at all surprised when the worst happens and he immediately pounces into rescue mode as if he had been expecting it all along. Director Pierre Morel (District B-13) paces Taken with the same brisk efficiency and ruthlessness Bryan uses to find his daughter (the movie clocks in at a quick 87 minutes minus end credits) so even though the film is pure formula there isnt a single moment in it when you start growing impatient. Even the obligatory exposition at the start of the picture breezes by because Neeson (unlike say Harrison Ford who would have probably starred in this movie 10 years ago) is as good of a dramatic actor as he is a kick-butt action hero. Its almost as much fun watching Neeson and Janssen trading barbed-wire jabs as it is seeing Neeson wreak great and painful havoc on the men who have kidnapped his daughter. Almost. Those men come from practically every country in Europe Taken is an equal-opportunity offender when it comes to caricatures of sleazy villainous foreigners including of course the French who come off all high and mighty but turn out to be the lowest of all. Such developments are all in the spirit of the rousing B-picture Taken really is. It excels at making you feel really good when the bad guys get theirs which happens constantly after the first 20 minutes. Like any half-decent thriller involving CIA superagents should Taken also teaches you a couple of tricks that will come in handy if you should find yourself in a similar situation (including how to avoid being located via satellite while using a cellphone to taunt the authorities). Neesons estimable presence adds a level of class to what could have easily degenerated into a Death Wish knock-off and hearing him spout lines like I can have 30 agents here before you have time to scratch your worthless b - - -s is a lot more fun than having Jean Claude Van Damme recite the same dialogue. Neesons an actor you know? Taken is nonsense but its terrifically entertaining nonsense especially in the midst of the January movie doldrums. It provides the reckless thrills that Quantum of Solace lacked. It also offers further refinement on a lesson an old TV sitcom once taught us When it comes to rescuing kids from multinational human trafficking rings father really does know best.

Liam Neeson plays a retired spy who leaves a trail of dead bodies as he searches for his daughters abductors in Taken. Photo Stephanie Branchu 20th Century Fox Taken 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Any parent could relate to Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) the retired super-spy at the center of Taken. All he wants is whats best for Kim his 17-year-old daughter (Maggie Grace). Divorced from her mother and overshadowed by her filthy-rich stepfather he would he says ``sacrifice anything for her. Specifically he would kill each and every scum he meets in Paris. The number he does on the City of Lights is comparable corpse-for-corpse to any damage wreaked by Jason Bourne. With one key difference Jason has a conscience or wishes he did. Bryan has none. I mean none. The only life that means anything to him is Kims and when she gets nabbed by Albanian sex traffickers on a trip abroad Bryan hops on a plane and lays waste to gay Paree. ""You cant just run around tearing up Paris"" whines a French colleague (Olivier Rabourdin). Au contraire Bryan says ""Ill tear down the Eiffel Tower if I have to."" Clench-jawed action star is a new gig for Neeson but the Man Who Was Schindler has long worn the mantle of heroism. The twist this time is an utter lack of moral complexity. Hes a dad and hes a killing machine and thats it. This blindered characterization makes for a driving premise and a few interesting scenes but it gets to be a bore after the shock wears off. If hell kill or maim just about anyone wheres the suspense? Its less Neesons fault or even director Pierre Morels than the movies co-writers Robert Mark Kamen and the entertainingly shlocky Luc Besson who also produced. The Besson-Kamen writing team gave us The Fifth Element all three Transporters and most recently a little Norwegian-Mexican comic Western called Bandidas. Theyre just the men for high-gloss knockabout bloodshed. So Bryan shoots people. He knifes them. He snaps their necks sprays them with hot steam and chases them onto highway ramps where theyre conveniently smooshed by oncoming traffic. He electrocutes a guy for information then flips on the switch and leaves. He wings a lady whose only crime is cooking him a nice chicken dinner -- and being married to the wrong man.The films single most effective scene is the tense trans-Atlantic sequence when Kim on the phone with her father sees her airhead friend (Katie Cassidy) abducted in a Parisian flat and realizes the kidnappers are coming for her next. As Bryan instructs his daughter to scream identifying characteristics (height hair color tattoos) into her cell the camera looks squarely at Neesons pale brow and watery blue eyes. He doesnt cry; his face is gripped not by immobilizing grief but by pragmatism professionalism and the need to act immediately. After he arrives in France theres a bit of quirk with a fellow hired to translate Albanian. What a nifty touch -- hey Bourne never hired a temp. For a minute there movie begins to approximate real-world logic. But then Bryan starts arguing with the Albanians in English and they argue back in English and at no point does anyone smack himself in the head and say ""Duh? Isnt this France?"" Bryan doesnt even arouse suspicion when he infiltrates the sex traders kitchen as a faux French agent and proceeds to boss everyone around in Anglais. Generally scenes begin with Bryan entering a building and end with a tangled splay of bodies. The fight choreography is fast fatal and nonstop raw meat for action devotees. But if its unrepentant violence youre after youre better off renting Morels 2004 collaboration with Besson District B13. It boasts lots of the same elements (Paris setting inky crime corrupt cops and a butt-kicking avenger out to rescue a kidnapped female relative) plus the exhilaration of Parkour chase scenes and the honesty of a hard-R rating. Despite the savagery of its violence Taken is PG-13. That alone should give a parent cause to worry -- especially Bryan. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Refurb Samsung 55"" 4K LED LCD UHD Smart TV for 550 + free...

Ex-wife Lenore isnt making it easy. Things are already tense between them when Kim decides to go on a grand adventure starting in Paris with her pretty ugly-American friend Amanda. The two girls meet a guy share a cab agree to go to a party. Then theyre snatched and plunged into a sex-trade underworld. But the Albanian thugs took the daughter of a guy of lethal know-how. ""Taken"" is an exploitation thriller the sort of studio pic that seizes the worst the world has to offer (the sex-slave outrages that The New York Times Nicholas Kristof exposed so brilliantly) to bolster its rote rhythms. This time its personal. This time theyve messed with the wrong guy. This time the trash -- be it Euro or Eastern-Euro or Middle Eastern -- will get taken out. Liam Neeson cuts a fine athletic figure in a leather coat. He conveys intelligence and determination. But Mills is devoid of heroic personality (or humor). Of course Mills an ex-CIA operative isnt supposed to break a sweat (or crack wise) only snap bones. See how fluidly he handles a stalker at a pop concert? The adrenaline rush director Pierre Morel injected into his terrific action flick ""District B13"" is nowhere to be found here. Instead were expected to embrace Mills grim payback not because the script by Luc Besson and Mark Kamen earns our emotions but merely because thats how action- thrillers work. Its hard to say exactly when ""Taken"" veers from familiar to galling. A torture scene perhaps? But it feels that way early The movie gives us no reason to care for Kim beyond the fact her dad cares. Or earlier still Famke Jannsen gives us every easy reason to loathe Mills ex Lenore. Before leaving for Paris dad and daughter share a moment. She asks what job kept him away during her childhood. ""I was a preventer"" he replies. ""I prevented bad things from happening."" Now that role falls to us. The bad thing you spending money for this utterly routine thriller.

Starring Liam Neeson Maggie Grace Famke Janssen Director Pierre Morel Running time 131  Editorial Review A satisfying thriller as grimly professional as its efficient hero ""Taken"" pairs the ruthless hand-to-hand combat of the Bourne series with the potent child-in-peril plotline of a Lifetime original movie. The story of an ex-CIA spook (Liam Neeson) who trains his deadly skills on the Albanian slavers who have kidnapped his daughter ""Taken"" delivers action car chases gunfights and just enough queasy exploitation to make you feel bad about yourself afterward.Bryan Mills retired from his CIA job to be closer to his daughter 17-year-old Kim (Maggie Grace noticeably 25) who lives in California with her mother (Famke Janssen in a role even more thankless than all her other thankless roles).Kim wants to spend the summer in Europe despite the qualms of her dad who sees danger around every corner. Needless to say Bryan is right Kim is nabbed less than an hour after landing at Charles de Gaulle airport and it falls to her father to rescue her from the sex-slavery ring that plans to sell her to a sheik. Neeson flies to Paris with the clock ticking on the defilement of his little girl.But if you can look past the ludicrous (and morally suspect) premise of ""Taken"" youre rewarded with the sight of Neeson -- an actor criminally underused by Hollywood -- tearing through the Parisian underworld karate-chopping left and right shooting anyone who gets between him and his daughter. The idea of Neeson passing unnoticed through the back alleys of Paris is a hilarious one and director Pierre Morel takes great pleasure in filming Neeson towering over the criminals he confronts.""Taken"" is perhaps best viewed as a cautionary tale for nervous fathers. Its message Dads dont let your little girls go anywhere or do anything ever.-- Dan Kois (Jan. 30 2009)Contains violence disturbing thematic material sexual content drug references and language.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Why do people keep stealing Liam Neesons stuff? The last time a man he played was in Europe it was to get his teenage daughter back from sex traffickers in Paris. A lot of cars were crashed and even more bones were broken. The occasion was preposterous. Its no less so this time. Now someone has stolen his identity. But while ""Unknown which opens today taps the same ludicrous action vein as ""Taken its a good deal more visually coherent and less demanding on Neeson and his stunt doubles.He plays Dr. Martin Harris an American who has just arrived in Berlin to present at a biotechnology summit. The minute he and his pretty young wife Liz (January Jones) arrive at their hotel he hops into another cab to fetch a briefcase he left at the airport. Oops. Some slickly choreographed highway mayhem sparked by a runaway fridge puts him in a four-day coma. When he awakens the movie has a nifty twist on the usual lost-memory plot. He knows exactly who he is. (Im the killing machine from ""Taken) Its his life that appears to have forgotten him.Martin leaves the hospital for the hotel. He lost his passport in the accident but hes certain he can find Liz and/or a colleague who can straighten out this mess. She tells him shes already married to a Dr. Martin Harris. This guy looks like Aidan Quinn. In some of the funnier writing Ive seen in one of these movies after Quinns character tells Martin to get lost Martin actually checks himself back into the hospital.Neeson is much better suited to the loneliness and self-doubt of Martins crisis than he was for the thuggery of the previous movie. The creases in his giant face always seem to harbor sadness stress and doubt. You want to pull up a stepladder and climb it in order to give him a hug. In ""Taken his washed-up Secret Service agent all too easily turned into a weapon of mass destruction. He simmers in ""Unknown without boiling over.He gets good support work from Berlin which here is a land of ashen landscapes and lethal driving. As if on cue the film coughs up Bruno Ganz as the former Secret Police agent Martin hires to get to the bottom of his mystery. Ganz is on hand to remind us that whats happening to Martin might be part of the modern German condition Were a truly forgetful people he says more or less. So really Martin is just in a ""when in Rome situation.Theres also both the lovely Diane Kruger as a Bosnian cabbie who runs around the city helping Martin while resisting the urge to get that stepladder and Frank Langella in a fedora. Without the very good writing of ""Mad Men to bring out her cunning Jones is ornamental someone who looks good in oversaturated flashbacks pressed up against a shower door. Without the show in ""Unknown shes Claire Danes in a Grace Kelly look-alike contest.She looks especially silly come the big reveal that involves a lot of talking a big bang and a big conspiracy. The movie is based on a French novel ""Out of My Head by Didier van Cauwelaert and co-produced by Joel Silver who runs a classy ship compared to the gleeful trash written and produced by Luc Besson who brought us ""Taken. ""Unknown gives us the director Jaume Collet-Serra who works with the chilly polish of some Roman Polanski thrillers -- that barreling fridge sums up the movies style.Accordingly the movie itself might be a work of mistaken identity. I saw ""Unknown with an entourage whose average age was about 70. They loved it although one of them kept calling it ""The Bond Ultimatum.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The risible thriller Taken has a message for overprotective fathers everywhere Dont let your teenage daughter go overseas. Shes almost certain to be abducted by Albanian sex traffickers. After reluctantly agreeing to allow his spoiled 17-year-old (Maggie Grace) to spend the summer in Paris with a friend ex-spy and estranged single father Liam Neeson braces himself for the inevitable the moment she passes through airport security. (He even takes a photo for posterity knowing it could be the last time he ever sees her.) Back at his apartment he waits and waits and waits for her to call. When she finally does in distress over three men invading her Paris flat Neeson is right there with a briefcase full of high-tech recording equipment giving her instructions. Apparently hes been keeping the case around as his personal ""Break Glass In Case Of Emergency Involving Albanian Sex Traffickers"" safeguard. Neesons readiness for worst-case scenarios--and screenwriters Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamens proficiency in queuing them up--fuels the high-octane lunacy of Taken which is a little like Paul Schraders Hardcore retooled as a Steven Seagal vehicle. Having a thespian of Neesons caliber chopping down burly henchmen with his bare hands creates a pleasant cognitive dissonance for a while but the film is unworthy of him. Director Pierre Morel also collaborated with Besson on the far more entertaining District B13 but Takens subject matter is too serious for an escapist chop-socky movie and the sleazy exploitative tone undercuts the thrills. Where Hardcore muddied the waters by questioning how far George C. Scott would take his odyssey into the porn underworld and at what cost to his soul--Taken never doubts Neesons righteousness even when hes torturing a bad guy with electrical wire or clipping a perfectly innocent woman in the arm just to get information. Hes a thug and though it takes some time to see past the sensitive Neeson of Schindlers List or Husbands And Wives he slips all too easily into the role.

Note the structural similarities misbehaving students a charismatic educator who wants them to succeed and big thoughts about the classroom as urban microcosm. Discuss the difference between Hollywoods triumphal individualism and Cantets delicate examination of what counts as success -- and failure -- in a representative corner of the global village. Played with febrile vitality by Francois Begaudeau a teacher who adapted The Class with Cantet and Robin Campillo from his novel Francois a junior high teacher in a moderately high-risk area of Paris uses language as a kind of dance that suits the scattered attention spans and compulsive back talk of the multiculti grab bag that is his class. Cantet who also made the extraordinary Time Out builds thickly detailed experiential worlds through which he slowly leaks the pressing problems of our age -- in this case the changing meaning of education in a heavily immigrant environment where a unifying culture has all but broken down. At the end of a very long day Francois may have scored some pedagogic victories and one human failure and we watch the teachers retreating back on which rests nothing less than the fragility of democracy in a racial tinder box. (The Landmark; Town Center 5; Playhouse 7) (Ella Taylor) A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - NEW IN TOWN A corporate tool but a stylish corporate tool single and ambitious Renee Zellweger is dispatched from sunny Miami to rural Minnesota to close the local factory. She has no personal backstory or identifying characteristics other than her Bettie Page-height boardroom fetish heels. Shes Mitt Romney in a mini and the business of New in Town is to soften her MBA-hardened heart. In doing so we get a standard assortment of sitcom-ready characters oversharing rube secretary (Siobhan Fallon Hogan); gruff foreman (J.K. Simmons); and hunky bachelor (Harry Connick Jr.). The effect is like Fargo without the woodchipper. Economic pain and the downsizing debate soon cede the screen to Zellwegers snowy pratfalls Lutefisk-out-of-water gags and makeover montages (widowed Connicks got a tween daughter doncha know). With a cheap for-hire Danish director (Jonas Elmer) and a co-writer (C. Jay Cox) whose major credit is Sweet Home Alabama the movie wrong-foots Zellweger from the start. Shes not enough ice queen like Sigourney Weaver in Working Girl for us to accept her transition into adorable Melanie Griffith. ""I will not get attached to this town or anyone in it"" Zellweger says. Ultimately we feel the same about her. (Citywide) (Brian Miller)OF TIME AND THE CITY One of the major British filmmakers of his generation Terence Davies revisits his youth to decidedly mixed effect in Of Time and the City -- a personal documentary evocation of post-World War II Liverpool. Davies 64 is only a few years younger than the Beatles and grew up in a similar working-class Liverpudlian milieu but suffering acute Catholic guilt for his sexual orientation recalls a wholly different history. Of Time and the City communicates acute if not bitter ambivalence Davies cant decide whether he wants to remember or forget the childhood ecstasy of attending Hollywood musicals or the ""dark desire"" of his adolescent fascination with professional wrestlers. Shots of miserable misbegotten housing estates are accompanied by Peggy Lees rendition of the saccharine ""The Folks Who Live on the Hill."" Korean War footage is set to ""He Aint Heavy Hes My Brother."" Davies concludes another tour of failed urban development by citing ""the British genius for making The Dismal"" -- a national characteristic he immediately demonstrates with a lugubriously hummed version of Brahms Lullaby. The filmmakers incantatory pompous delivery seems designed to create maximum distance from the material. He has nothing but scorn for a royal coronation and the ascension of the Fab Four is greeted with a sarcastic ""yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah."" No nostalgic ""Penny Lane"" or ""Strawberry Fields"" here. The filmmaker prefers an angrier form of sentimentality. (Nuart) (J. Hoberman)SAMS LAKE A group of friends travels with their recently bereaved compadre Sam (The Lost Skeleton of Cadavras Fay Masterson) to her cabin at the mountain lake she was named after only to encounter -- natch -- a creepy gas-station attendant and a local legend about a Michael Myers-like escaped lunatic. Two of the producers on this would-be ""horror"" film Guy Oseary and Mark Morgan count Twilight among their credits; that presumably was enough to buy this 4-year-old production a one-week run in New York and L.A. Perhaps itll have some appeal to all the Stephenie Meyer fangirls -- much like that authors take on the vampire mythos Andrew C. Erins film works familiar horror tropes and neuters the hell out of them here presenting the most metrosexual well-coiffed family of backwoods killers youve ever seen. Also pretty much all the acts of violence happen offscreen and theres no sex. But for some stray profanities this could be a TV movie except then the acting would probably be better. The nicest one can say about Sams Lake is that its well-shot and that its major plot twist is genuinely surprising ... if only because it makes no sense at all. (Grande 4-Plex; Sunset 5) (Luke Y. Thompson) Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat. Sep. 10 1200pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On the CW Tickets Sat. Sep. 10 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On CBS Tickets Mon. Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm TAKEN is one dumped-in-January film thats better than it needs to be but alas still isnt good enough. Retired from his job as an ass-kicking American operative to be closer to his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) Bryan (Liam Neeson) can only listen in horror when she calls from Paris while human traffickers abduct her. Directed by Pierre Morel whose French hit District B13 only worked when its characters were pummeling and chasing each other Taken tells a pretty standard not-my-child revenge story concerning Bryans one-man mission to bust heads in the City of Light. As one would expect from Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen -- the writing team behind the pleasingly ludicrous pseudosophisticated Transporter series -- the film gives action fans a few glimpses of picturesque international locales before the story gets down to the business of shooting maiming and torturing vaguely foreign baddies. Neesons tormented weariness lends an air of dignity to the films pulpy grubby nastiness but as striking as he is in action-hero mode the truth is that Taken doesnt need dignity. It requires tongue-in-cheek machismo that mocks the storys B-movie inanities while playing them to the hilt. What was Jason Statham busy? (Citywide) (Tim Grierson)UNDERWORLD RISE OF THE LYCANS The original Underworld released six years ago introduced a high-concept/low-excitement war between vampires in fetish gear and video game-caliber werewolves -- and ""in the spirit of equanimity"" someone wrote at the time ""the movie both sucks and bites."" No such draw here This deadly prequel explaining the roots of the bloodsucker-fangface grudge match is a 92-minute detainment in Sucksylvania. Like the first two movies its too glum and humorless to wring any fun from its dorky premise At least seven-eighths of this one takes place in a dreary monochromatic castle and much of thats in a dungeon. Though hes chained up with other ""lycan"" slaves werewolf messiah Lucian (Michael Sheen) pursues a love that dare not howl its name with vampire princess Sonja (Rhona Mitra) while her aristocratic dad Viktor (Bill Nighy) skulks around like a Balkan Ming the Merciless. In lieu of advancing a story the third Underworld repeats incessantly -- multiple bloody floggings multiple captures multiple trudges back to the dungeon -- while the cinematography does its best to evoke the many-hued visual splendor of an ashtray. Mincing around like a bored old glam rocker and hissing threats from behind electric neon eyes Nighy seems to be the only person on set who found a glint of amusement in his part. He fares better than poor Sheen a scraggly Wolverine who made a more credible vampire-slayer opposite Frank Langellas Nixon. (Citywide) (Jim Ridley)THE UNINVITED Two weeks after the reach-out-and-touch gore of My Bloody Valentine in 3-D the splatter-free teen chiller The Uninvited feels sweetly old-fashioned. Sixteen-year-old Anna (Emily Browning) who attempted suicide after her mothers death leaves a psych hospital and returns to the gorgeous Maine lake house of her novelist father (David Strathairn). Soon shes visited by the decayed corpse of her mother who warns Anna that her fathers new girlfriend (Elizabeth Banks) is a murderer. A remake of the 2003 Korean horror film A Tale of Two SistersThe Uninvited is a Hand That Rocks the Cradle-type thriller thats been dressed up as a horror movie. For the most part the mix works although the films twist ending seemed to irritate a recent preview audience. Weve seen it all before but that doesnt diminish the accomplishment of first-time directors (and brothers) Charles and Thomas Guard who clearly believe that a creaking door is scarier than a gouged-out eyeball. Hats off to them although one cant help but wonder how the great Strathairn ended up in a teen-beat horror flick four years after his triumphant Best Actor Oscar nomination for Good Night and Good Luck. In Hollywood the horror never ends. (Citywide) (Chuck Wilson) Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke? NEXT Contact LA Weekly Follow LA Weekly laweekly L.A.

"Movie review Taken -- 4 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Taken -- 4 out of 5 stars Liam Neeson 20th Century Fox Liam Neeson Liam Neeson (20th Century Fox) Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Three self-evident truths emerge from Taken the lean and brutal thriller about why one should NEVER kidnap a retired secret agents daughter.Liam Neeson could have had a helluva career as an action star had he been willing to sell out. Secondly when it comes to action pictures there are movies that come out under the aegis of Luc Besson (The Professional La Femme Nikita The Transporter) and theres everybody else.And lastly if were letting CIA agents this ruthless and tough ""retire"" then plainly government pensions are entirely too generous. Taken is about a divorced doting dad who has quit his job with ""The Agency"" to be closer to his teenage daughter (Maggie Grace). Dad doesnt just dote. He sticks his nose right in Miss Kims business.""Mom said your job made you paranoid"" she sniffs.""My job made me aware"" he corrects.Against his better judgment he lets the kid whose mom (Famke Janssen) has re-married and married money take off for Paris. Sure enough bad things happen to naive teenage girls abroad. The kidnapping itself is a drum-tight piece of writing and a brilliant bit of stagecraft. Shes on the phone with Dad. Men come into another room and grab her friend. He has just enough time to prepare her to instruct her on the basics -- ""Focus"" ""Yell out descriptions of the men"" and hold the phone where he can pick up their voices.The exclamation point to the scene is Neeson in a fathers righteous measured fury telling the kidnappers about his ""very particular skills"" and how they should let her go and just walk away. They dont. (They never do.) Bad move.Cinematographer-turned-director Pierre Morel working from a Besson story (with the master looking over his shoulder during editing no doubt) transforms the big burly Irishman into a karate-chopping derriere-kicking bloodhound calling on old friends using his ""particular skills"" to hunt down the kid and those who napped her. Neeson barrels through the screen like a muscle car bouncing anything French Albanian American or Arabic out of his way.The films brevity means that they only have time to establish the mans affection for his child and his competence. The opening scenes show him bickering with the ex and then joining some ex-colleagues on a pop star security detail and foiling a stalker.Some moments play as seriously worn out. And as the story resolves itself a discomfiting French xenophobia and a little CIA torture enters the picture which wont be to every taste.But the chases those fights -- what a rush Besson didnt re-invent the action film. Still as Taken re-iterates Bessons espresso-jag thrillers are all the caffeine an action fan needs until the summer thrill rides arrive.

"Taken | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; taken ) Taken (France 2008) January 27 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli If there are any 24 fans who have wondered what the TV series might be like if Liam Neeson replaced Kiefer Sutherland Taken provides an opportunity to have that question answered. Neesons Bryan Mills uses nearly all the Jack Bauer tactics including torture bone-crunching and bloodletting. He gets involved in car chases shootouts and brings a gun to a knife fight. Like the Energizer Bunny he takes a licking but keeps on ticking. When it comes to action Taken gets the job done. The film is never boring. It is however completely preposterous. The screenplay credited to Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen feels like the CliffsNotes version of something longer and more detailed. In order to shoehorn the introduction into a tidy 30-minute package subtlety is abandoned. There are no transitions but theres a lot of heavy-handed exposition. The filmmakers approach is never to use a precision tool when a sledgehammer is available. Credulity isnt high on the list of characteristics they are striving for. The payoff is that once the movie gets going the ride is enjoyable (if dumb). And one has to accept that while the ending resolves the films main storyline there are countless dangling threads about which we are supposed to forget. The film introduces us to ex-government operative Bryan Mills and wastes little time showing how competent he is in high-pressure situations when while working as a hired security guard he saves the life of a pop starlet (Holly Valance). Meanwhile Bryan is trying to reconnect with his 17-year old daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) but all she really wants from him is a signature on a permission slip so she can spend a few weeks in Paris. Because he ""knows the world"" to be a dangerous place hes initially reluctant but after a few nasty stares and cutting remarks from his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) he agrees. The next time he hears from Kim shes in danger. A group of men have broken into her Paris residence and are stalking her. Armed with little in the way of concrete information Bryan heads for Europe with the twin goal of finding his daughter and killing those who kidnapped her. The path leads into a maze that includes police corruption Albanian organized crime and sex slave trafficking. On one level its refreshing to see people get killed when guns are fired. Hollywoods PG-13 vision is that lots of violence is okay as long at the results of the violence are neutered. Its a little surprising that this movie with its frank and graphic depictions of torture and unflinching images of death missed an R. It boggles the mind that the MPAA somehow deemed this appropriate for teenagers but found Slumdog Millionaire too harsh. I feel reasonably sure that five or ten years ago this cut of Taken would have been rated R. The body count is high - probably at least 20. Jack Bauer would be proud. This is a French film and most of it takes place in Paris but as is the case for many projects with which Luc Besson is involved it was made with an international market in mind. Besson likes to believe he can ""out-Hollywood Hollywood."" So in this case theres plenty of action the stars are internationally known and the dialogue is primarily in English. Despite these factors 20th Century Fox hasnt thrown its full weight of approval behind Taken - the movies release date was pushed back several times and it reached U.S. theaters only after it was already available on DVD in Europe. For Liam Neeson this is one of those ""paycheck"" roles. Hes not required to do much more than look grim and participate in some carefully choreographed action sequences. Maggie Grace still best known for her doomed role in Lost has the thankless task of playing the victim. Theres no single villain so a bunch of unknowns play various nefarious individuals who bear some degree of responsibility for what has happened to Kim. Unlike in many action films of this sort however theres no individual at the top of the totem pole so Bryans goal is to eliminate everyone with any degree of involvement. Theres no Payback scenario. Taken has the kind of story that if fleshed out properly in a novel might be a page-turner. The perfunctory contrived manner in which director Pierre Morel handles the material however ensures that the movie is never given the opportunity to rise above the level of a cheap potboiler. Like most winter releases this is one that can be easily bypassed. The well-crafted trailer promises more atmosphere and intelligence than the movie delivers.

Someones beaten them to it. Taken is basically the over-the-top high-octane world of Bauer with Liam Neeson playing the all-around bad-ass guy. (He even steals a signature Bauer move.) Only this time as they say its personal. Its also frequently ridiculous another trait it shares with 24. But - one more thing in common - its also fun. Neeson plays Bryan Mills who has retired from his job as a CIA ""preventer"" - a shadowy spy-type gig that took him around the world doing all sorts of top-secret maneuvers but kept him away from his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). Now Mills is trying to make up for lost time quitting his job to be closer to Kim. But his former wife (Famke Janssen) has remarried a rich man (Xander Berkeley) who spoils Kim. She wants to go to Paris for the summer with a friend. Mills who has seen perhaps too much of the bad in the world doesnt want her to. But his former wife and Kim tag-team him with guilt and accusations of paranoia so he relents. And naturally before she has been in Paris for an hour Kim and her friend are kidnapped. In fact the set-up happens ON THE WAY TO A FRIENDS HOUSE FROM THE AIRPORT. (Those foreign gangsters waste no time.) This is an especially rough bunch (even the Russians give them a wide berth were told) Albanians who addict young women to drugs and either use them as prostitutes or sell them as sex slaves. Mills intelligence contacts tell him hes got 96 hours to find her (four times as many as Bauer gets) before shes lost forever. Next thing you know Mills is in Paris rooting around the city turning up leads and killing and maiming people left and right. An old cohort (Olivier Rabourdin) now working behind a desk warns him to lie low but knows he wont. As the body count grows Mills makes good on his threats to the kidnappers often seen in countless airings of the trailer that he will find them. But can he find Kim? Its all pretty stupid. Despite a wealth of weapons including machine guns no one can seem to bring Mills down. He on the other hand has no such trouble. But the action whizzes by so fast - director Pierre Morel keeps the pace pounding - that you dont really notice the absurdity too much until after its over and youve had time to think about it. Not that Taken encourages much thought. The less thinking you do in fact the better. Neeson is an interesting choice for an action hero and his straightforward no-nonsense performance - ""I will find you"" all that - is enjoyable enough. Mills is certainly not shy about spreading the violence around. You wonder how long it will take Paris to put itself back together after he leaves town. But thats about all youll wonder. Taken is movie junk food - fun while it lasts but not much more. Nothing wrong with that kind of snack every now and then. You just wont want a steady diet of it.

An anxious American father is on the phone to his daughter when she and her friend are abducted from their Paris hotel. Her dream holiday was always his worst nightmare. Now that nightmare is real. He has 96 hours to save his daughter from being sold into prostitution. Pretty much what youd expect then except for one surprise the father an ex-government agent with a particular set of skills is played by heavyweight Liam Neeson. Neesons presence lends dramatic heft to a formulaic action movie that otherwise majors in chase scenes and the brutally efficient use of firepower martial arts fire extinguishers and broken bottles. The quest is simple as are the undeniable pleasures. Director Pierre Morels directing style is ruthlessly efficient but leaves no time to ponder the plot holes or the borderline racist portrayal of vicious Albanian gangsters and sleazy Arab businessmen.

Corrupt French Officers and evil Arabs involved in human trafficking. The film is actually quite bad. Liam Neesons character beats so many people up calling this film campy is actually a compliment. There isnt a stereotype this film doesnt employ. Poor but masculine father wife leaves him for a rich man. The daughter prefers her life with the rich step father but still loves her Daddy. The rich step father is impotent when the girl is taken and the real father a black ops specialist (played by Neeson) rescues his daughter despite a corrupt French Police force and an international ring of Arab terrorists involved in human trafficking. By the end of the film I couldnt stop laughing. Neesons character and his ability to beat everyone up is so unrealistic it makes old Van Damme movies seem plausible.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 19 2011DavidFeaturedThe idea that this film is racist is ridiculous. Racism wont go away if people keep bringing it up at a whim. Im sure if ALL the people in the film who were engaged in the sex trade were Americans there wouldnt have been a mention of racism.

Without ever taking his shirt off Liam Neeson makes a surprisingly convincing one-man mean machine in ""Taken"" in which an ex-CIA agent rids Paris of most of its Albanian population while rescuing his darlin teen daughter from nasty white-slave traders. Very much in the style of other non-redemptive Euro shoot-em-ups from Luc Bessons EuropaCorp stable (""The Transporter"" etc.) dumb pedal-to-the-metal actioner will sit well with target auds in fast playoff before robust ancillary. Late February release in Gaul has already notched up a warm 4 million in its first two frames; Stateside release via Fox is skedded for September. Onetime Langley grunt Bryan Mills (Neeson) has moved to Los Angeles to be near his spoiled 17-year-old daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) now embedded in a world of luxury since his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) married rich businessman Stuart (Xander Berkeley). When some ex-CIA pals offer him a nights work bodyguarding a singer (Holly Valance) its clear Bryan has lost none of his Jason Bourne-like skills when he saves the diva from an attempted slaying. Under pressure from Lenore Bryan reluctantly agrees to let Kim go on a Euro trip with schoolfriend Amanda (Katie Cassidy). But when both girls are kidnapped by evil Albanians within minutes of their arrival Bryan hops one of Stuarts private jets to Paris to find her. He reckons he has 96 hours before Kim ends up a drug-addicted lump of white meat. Besson alum Pierre Morel who was d.p. on ""The Transporter"" and previously helmed 2004s futuristic actioner ""District B13"" wisely doesnt give the viewer any time to ponder the string of unlikely coincidences in the script by Besson and regular scribe Robert Mark Kamen. From the actual kidnapping -- breathlessly staged with Kim actually on the phone with dad -- to Bryan arriving in Paris and immediately causing a pileup outside the airport pic has the forward devil-may-care momentum of a Bond movie on steroids. With grudging help from former French intelligence op Jean-Claude (Olivier Rabourdin) and an Albanian translator (Goran Kostic) Bryan discovers and then trashes the baddies ramshackle brothel prior to tracking down kidnapper Marko (Arben Bajraktaraj) and his gang. He then learns Kim has been sold in a high-class auction arranged by a certain Patrice St. Clair (Gerard Watkins) for -- natch -- Arab clients. Interventionist politics of the movie which plays like ""Rambo in Paris"" hardly bear thinking about but Neeson growls his way through the functional dialogue as an unstoppable killing machine in impressive cold-eyed style. For a thesp now in his mid-50s he handles the niftily edited bone-crunching action way better than his scenes as a sappy devoted father. Other thesps simply register as evil gun-fodder or script cutouts (including a wasted Janssen) with only Rabourdin suggesting anything like a real character. Widescreen package is technically slick at all levels and ditto the action choreography in a cartoonish way.
