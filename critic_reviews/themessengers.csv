A gothic ghost story it harks back to the stylish creepiness of their breakthrough Hong Kong movie The Eye but is constrained by an over-worked generic plot.Seeking a fresh start Roy Solomon (Dylan McDermott ) moves with his wife and three kids to a remote North Dakota farm. Drifter John Burwell (John Corbett) helps plant sunflowers and becomes a trusted employee. Then as harbinger crows swirl about two of the children see pale-skinned spectres scuttling across the ceiling and floating down hallways. But one stays mute and the others visions are dismissed as attention-seeking.Mark Wheatons genre-savvy script and the Pang brothers fluid visual style generate some powerful scares and involving emotional undercurrents. Yet many of the images feel over-familiar and the shocks a mite too forced.

I only spotted two. Which makes me think even more that the reviewer here didnt even watch the film. The plot is predictable the characters are as wooden as the house they move to amp; the viewer knowing nothing about the family doesnt care about them so doesnt care what happens to them - its a rule as old as the hills make people care about the people in your movie by building their personalities. This was simply dreadful.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 27 2008CraigFeaturedMy God I fell to sleep.

First theres the pale kid with white-orb eyes. Next theres the slow-moving ghoul -- typically female -- who either lurks in the back of the frame or else colludes with the editor to pop up right in your face. And then theres the crawler When Asian movie ghouls move fast for some reason theyre usually on all fours. The Asian-horror-movie moment feels long since passed both here and abroad. Let our zombies walk or even sprint again Give our creepy kids back their pupils There are a few decent jolts in The Messengers but every one of them is accompanied by a cheap freak-out on the soundtrack so you know to be decently jolted. The story kicks off when Dylan McDermott moves his family -- including a mute toddler who likes to point his stubby finger at freaky stuff -- into a North Dakota house that looks half burned down and the movie only makes less sense from there. Soon his teen daughter (Kristen Stewart) is seeing things her parents cannot like a pair of blue hands coming at her out of quicksand in the basement. Her parents think shes crazy and since she glumly sticks around for more maybe she is. Why is the girl not scared? Perhaps shes seen too many horror movies?

Indeed as this sludgy collision of Hong Kong and all-American horror movie cliches made its way from one tedious THX-enhanced sonic boo moment to the next I found myself rolling the co-directors name over on my tongue simply to keep amused Oxide Pang Oxide Pang Oxide Pang-a-lang-bang-dangOxide as some of you may know but many wont is the twin brother of Danny Pang and the two acquired global geek approval by writing and directing The Eye a stylishly superficial made-in-Hong Kong spook movie that was heavy on the spectacle of creepy things swooshing across the slightly-out-of-focus background of a shot while some poor fool fretted in the extreme foreground. Visually its a good trick and the Pang brothers proved their affection for it by sharing it with viewers at every available opportunity. Although now working in America the Pangs clearly remain fond of the technique as just about every second scene of The Messengers - which is about a city family (consisting of Dylan McDermott Penelope Anne Miller their daughter Kristen Stewart and a toddler whose actor name doesnt matter) that moves to a crow-strewn North Dakota farmhouse every bit as haunted as it looks - features a digital spook skittering noisily across the unfocused background. In the future there may be a drinking game in this.From the moment the Solomons arrive at the farmhouse (apparently purchased through Amityville Real Estate) where dad hopes to restore some ""stability to my family"" by growing a vast crop of economically dubious but visually arresting sunflowers were delivered right along with them directly to the doorstep of deepest horror-movie dumbassedness. No sooner has the ghost-bait clan tumbled out of their station wagon - in which they have bickered over an incident in the past that will guarantee the kids come in for a lot more swooshing than their oblivious parents - than they practically fall over each other in vaulting headlong toward every creak moan dark hallway and rattly-knobbed cellar door. If the ghosts were magnets and the Solomons were paperclips the two parties couldnt be in a bigger rush to collide.While just about every cast member over the age of 16 seems embalmed - the most impressive thing about McDermott is how many different colours of Wrangler shirts he wears - my sympathies nevertheless surged when Penelope Ann Miller as the mother who spends most of The Messengers trying to scrub away a ghastly stain that keeps seeping through the wallpaper decides shes had her fill of hysterical teenage-girl talk of ghosts spooks screams and other things that go swoosh in the off-focus background.""Enough"" she blurts sobbing. ""Please Thats enough""You said it ma.

Even when theyre working with weak material -- the case with this haunted house picture set around a South Dakota farm where a Chicago family has settled -- the Pangs devise scenes so scary that they stain the imagination and never scrub out.Poor Denise; her would-be farmer husband Roy (Dylan McDermott); her troubled teenage daughter Jess (Kristen Stewart); and her mute toddler son Ben (Evan and Theodore Turner) clearly didnt see ""The Amityville Horror."" Otherwise they wouldnt spend more than one night in their new house a desolate place with nighttime creaks aplenty plus hair-raising apparitions (including a skittering thing that Ben thinks is his playmate) and an aggressive flock of crows.The children bear the brunt of the terror and of course the parents dont understand; little Ben cant speak and Jess is permanently grounded after a traumatic lapse in judgment that precipitated the familys move. The nomadic handyman Burwell (a ponytailed John Corbett) who joins in the planting of sunflowers and befriends Jess is a cryptic rock but faced with such an immense evil that hes bound to break. Photo Kristen Stewart is wary of her new home in ""The Messengers."" Credit Takashi Seida/Columbia Pictures Like too many horror pictures ""The Messengers"" becomes more boringly prosaic as it goes along and theres an 11th-hour plot twist so dumb and poorly articulated that it destroys the movie. Thats a shame because shot for shot the Pangs might be the most terrifying filmmakers alive. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Drawing equally on recent Japanese horror (that stain image was in ""Dark Water"") and 1930s dont-open-that-door tropes ""The Messengers"" is every ghost movie ever made done better than many. Off-center compositions leave vast empty spaces where evil can lurk; a nervous camera catches blurry figures an instant before they disappear behind a door frame; fiendishly mixed sound effects make it seem as if foul forces are rattling about not just in the attic or basement but inside your head. ""The Messengers"" is an unsatisfying film but anyone who claims not to be scared by it is lying.""The Messengers"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has supernatural shocks and brutal violence mostly implied but some explicit. THE MESSENGERSOpened yesterday nationwide.

Starring Kristen Stewart Dylan McDermott Penelope Ann Miller and John Corbett. Directed by Oxide Pang and Danny Pang. (PG-13. 84 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. See complete movie listings and show times and buy tickets for select theaters at sfgate.com/movies.) ""The Messengers"" isnt a particularly frightening or gory horror movie but directors Danny and Oxide Pang do have a special talent for torturing the reputations of their actors. This is a movie that features former ""Sex and the City"" hunk John Corbett looking more like David Crosby than you can possibly imagine and ""The Practice"" lawyer Dylan McDermott as a sunflower farmer. Both are subjected to humiliating attacks by flocks of angry crows. If that sounds like fun be warned that most of the rest of the film is extremely boring. Its as if someone took the worst 54 minutes of ""Places in the Heart"" and spliced it with the worst half-hour of ""The Grudge 2."" Hopefully this is both the beginning and the end of the agricultural horror genre. McDermott makes a decent Secret Service agent and a convincing cutthroat attorney. He would probably be a good TV series doctor and could easily pull off a professor or a corporate accountant. But as much as the actor looks good hailing a taxi hes completely out of place trying to repair a tractor. Roy (McDermott) has just moved from Chicago to rural North Dakota with his wife teen daughter and toddler son. Its not a very fun trip because his spouse (Penelope Ann Miller) is a bit of a shrew his daughter is a drama queen and his son sees dead people. Corbett adds a little fun when he shows up as a ranch hand if you can resist the urge to break into ""Almost Cut My Hair."" The ghosts in ""The Messengers"" sneak around Roys new home an old fixer-upper that looks like it was designed by ""The Amityville Horror"" house architect. But this is no old-school haunting -- the Pang brothers have built one of those ""Grudge""-""Pulse""-""Ring"" universes where anything goes whether its black ooze in the basement crows in the station wagon or scary pale humanoid things skittering across the ceiling. Most of the scares are generated by the soundtrack which is mixed way too loudly and has sort of a bludgeoning effect that is more annoying than frightening. Screenwriter Mark Wheaton includes a lot of minutiae about sunflower growing but he doesnt bother to give the ghosts in ""The Messengers"" much of a reason for existing. Usually in a movie like this theres an Indian burial ground that has been violated -- or at least a scene in the last 10 minutes where a main character sifts through newspaper clippings at the library unraveling a horrible story about a parent who killed his kids. Instead we get crows with no motivation except to make the actors theyre attacking look ridiculous. If Tippi Hedren taught us nothing else in ""The Birds"" pulling off a big-screen bird attack is about more than screaming really loud and flailing your arms. -- Advisory This film contains profanity violence and a few loud scares. Theres also a scene where Roy tries to feed his toddler whole carrots which is a serious choking hazard for a 2-year-old.

If youre going to steal you may as well choose quality source material and Hong Kong brothers Danny and Oxide Pang have done just that in making their first English-language feature. But working from a screenplay by Mark Wheaton based on a story by Todd Farmer the Pangs also have added their own Asian-terror touches. (The identical twins are responsible for among other movies ""The Eye"" about a blind girl who receives a cornea transplant that allows her to see dead people. Tom Cruise and Paula Wagners production company is remaking it.) And so the ghosts who inhabit the creepy creaky farmhouse in North Dakota crawl about with that familiar staccato scamper their faces and bodies ashen their hair black and stringy. If youve seen this image once youve seen it a hundred times. Its still pretty unnerving. While ""The Messengers"" is very au courant stylistically its pure old-school horror thematically a haunted house in the middle of nowhere a small town with weird locals menacing crows that swoop and peck and lots of sharp farm equipment just lying around waiting to be used as a weapon. The Solomon family moves in after some unnamed trouble in Chicago looking for a fresh start but clueless about the murders that took place in the house just a few years earlier. Dad Roy (Dylan McDermott) plans to harvest sunflowers. Mom Denise (Penelope Ann Miller) wants to spruce up the place and make it a home. But surly teenage daughter Jess (Kristen Stewart who played Jodie Fosters daughter in ""Panic Room"") is understandably less than thrilled about being uprooted from her friends. Shes also the inspiration behind the move for reasons we learn later. Then theres 3-year-old Ben (played by Evan and Theodore Turner) who has stopped speaking but is perceptive enough to recognize that something supernatural lurks within the house and is trying to contact them. He points and stares straight ahead or at the ceiling looking cherubic all the while which is pretty frightening in itself. The Pangs let the action play out slowly and simply which is effective. Even after John Corbett shows up as a drifter looking for work on the farm one whos a little too trigger-happy with his rifle when the birds start hovering the brothers still maintain a steady pace. It isnt until the end that things spin out of control. No one says ""Gimme the bat Wendy"" or ""Heres Johnny"" But they come close.

Pics success will depend on auds willingness to sacrifice narrative cohesion for an elegant and scary funhouse ride. The Pang brothers signature visual pizzazz is strongly displayed in their first Hollywood studio production ""The Messengers"" a haunted farmhouse story boasting excellent atmospherics. Oxide and Danny Pangs trademark spins on composition timing and special effects though hardly groundbreaking (and sometimes downright imitative) are impressively even joyfully rendered as if inviting viewer complicity. Unfortunately this playful artistry seldom jibes with the forced family values plotline. The Pangs painfully hew to a vision of an idealized Americana with the ""happy ending"" coming off as especially egregious. Pics success will depend on auds willingness to sacrifice narrative cohesion for an elegant and scary funhouse ride. Pics black-and-white pre-credit sequence the bloody slaughter of a farm family by unseen hands plays out in intriguingly fragmented form. Though replete with rather corny horror tropes -- crows broodingly roosting on the rooftop a terrified child clutching his favorite toy as he huddles in a cupboard -- these scenes are remarkably and tersely effective. The present day arrives amped up to full color and the Solomons enter having just bought the murdered familys farm in a last-ditch effort to save their clan from economic (and personal) disaster. Pic centers around Jess (Kristen Stewart) the teenage daughter of the Solomon brood. Coyly dropped hints make it clear that her father (Dylan McDermott) and mother (Penelope Ann Miller) have never really forgiven her for whatever disaster has brought the Chicago family to this run-down North Dakota farmhouse. (Film was shot near Regina Saskatchewan.) A helpful passing stranger with a gun (John Corbett) is hired on to round out the household. The farm is a template of spookiness with slamming doors fingernail scratches on the floor and mysterious signs and shapes. At first only mute toddler Ben (Evan/Theodore Turner) can see the decomposing ghosts that float or skitter and scuttle around the walls and ceilings following them with his eyes and pointing up at them with wonder and delight. Jess as-yet-unspecified sin guarantees that once she catches on and confronts the dark forces with spectacularly destructive results no one will believe her. The Pangs bring on a whole panoply of both Asian and American ghostly bells and whistles with restrained panache oozing ectoplasm or choreographing darting shapes only on the margins of the frame while ominous camera movements effectively ratchet up suspense. They have a knack for fast-edited sound-amplified ""gotcha"" moments and deliberately stretched-out plays with space and time taunting viewers by consciously withholding reverse-angles or tweaking sudden perspective-shifts. Jittery cross-cutting between black-and-white past terrors and present color threats mesh the two timeframes with surprising vigor. Yet despite fine thesping by all concerned the violence of the past never convincingly resonates in the clumsily developed family dynamics of the present. Jess screw-up in Chicago when it is finally revealed proves a huge anticlimax that seems totally irrelevant to the ghost story. For their part the ghosts sole motives are to indiscriminately grab anyone who ventures into their purview. Unlike the genre touchstones that pic references (a pitchfork replaces Jack Nicholsons axe in a ""Shining""-like rampage while a crow attack is an outright homage if not a steal from ""The Birds"") pics morally-loaded tales of family redemption seems artificially pasted onto its evocative spook play. Though the Pangs prove culturally adaptive on a visual level (Stewarts angular face lacking the smooth impenetrability of Asian girls visages is asymmetrically and cubistically framed creating a more nervous form of otherworldly awareness) they seem completely clueless as to the tonal modalities of Mark Wheatons admittedly undercooked all-American script. Pic production team includes Sam Raimi (whose ""Evil Dead"" classics are sporadically evoked) and Joseph Drake (producer of ""The Grudge"") but no one managed to bridge the gap between script and direction in this uneven outing.

"Messengers The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; messengers-the ) Messengers The (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli I define a ""boo"" moment as an instant in a movie when there is a loud sound usually accompanied by a musical stinger and occasionally in concert with the fast pass of an unidentifiable object across a portion of the cameras field of view. The idea behind a ""boo"" moment is to startle viewers. Most horror fans are conversant with ""boo"" moments but if youre confused The Messengers offers a primer. Its wall-to-wall ""boo"" moments with almost nothing else to recommend it. By the end of the film these instances have become so frequent that theyre more comedic than horrific. (People in the audience took the ""boo"" to heart because thats how they reacted when the movie ended.) Its a little sad that The Messengers is ultimately a good candidate for burial in a toxic waste dump because there are some good elements contained herein. The underpinnings of an effective psychological thriller are undermined by the manner in which the story is told. (Is the lead character seeing ghosts or is she mentally unstable?) And there are some frighteningly effective isolated images that if used in service of a smart or coherent storyline could have made this one of those rare PG-13 horror movies that works. The Messengers borrows so heavily from The Amityville Horror The Birds The Grudge Poltergeist and others that it has no room left for anything of its own. At times this feels like ""Horrors Greatest Hits"" performed by imposters. Of the actors only Kristen Stewart takes things seriously as the girl who sees dead people. Everyone else cant seem to believe they signed to be in this movie. Roy (Dylan McDermott) and Denise (Penelope Ann Miller) have packed up their family and moved to a spooky old house in the middle of nowhere because they think this is the best way to reform their ""troubled"" teenage daughter Jess (Kristen Stewart). Jess has done something wrong - we figure this out when her father sits with her to have a ""this isnt a punishment; its a way to start over again"" discussion. Poor Jess is despondent over having to leave behind her friends to live in the ultimate fixer-upper while her dad and his new hired hand John (John Corbett) plant sunflowers. Soon Jess starts seeing ghosts but when she tells Mom and Dad theyre not receptive. They accuse Jess of making things up because all teenagers act up by pretending that their freaky-looking mansion in the middle of nowhere is haunted. Who writes this stuff anyway? As if the family dynamic aspect of the film isnt silly enough the movie completely loses it when it introduces a pitchfork murderer subplot in the last 30 minutes. Apparently its no longer good enough to have a haunted house movie in which the ghosts are malevolent for no apparent reason. Nowadays everything has to have an explanation. Its like claiming that Michael Myers was evil because he was abused as a kid. Horror movies want to give their villains cause to plead ""not guilty by reason of insanity"" to multiple murder charges. Early during The Messengers its easy enough to ignore the movies moronic domestic intrigue and painfully bad character development because the Pang Brothers (Hong Kong vets making their English language debut) generate a strong sense of isolation and atmosphere. The sequence in which the ghosts reveal themselves to Jess is tense and creepy (and comes complete with a couple of the ubiquitous ""boo"" moments). Unfortunately the more the movie concentrates on its inane plot the more unbearable it becomes. The ending is cataclysmically bad but the build-up is such that we expect it. To the extent that an audience exists for PG-13 ghost stories that employ stupid plot contrivances and out-of-left-field twists to avoid making no sense whatsoever people will see The Messengers. One thing is for certain those who pay for the dubious privilege will get their moneys worth of ""boo"" moments. That arguably qualifies this as a great date movie. The clutching may never stop.

"Brothers use general delivery for ghost story - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Brothers use general delivery for ghost story By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  February 2 2007 The Pang brothers Danny and Oxide arrive on American screens with high and horrific expectations trailing a bloody body of Hong Kong ghost stories (like 2002s ""The Eye"") that the twins have written and directed. A New York Times magazine profile last summer bumped the hype up a notch.That all this has resulted in ""The Messengers"" a stylish but almost completely generic thriller is as anticlimactic as the movie itself. Its good for scaring 14-year-old girls and impressing budding cinematographers and that friends is it.The Solomon family has moved from the big city to the creepy country as the film opens Dad (Dylan McDermott) has dreams of being a sunflower farmer -- hes eyeing the lucrative Major League Baseball market I guess -- while uptight mom (Penelope Ann Miller) irons compulsively and tries to smile without pulling a muscle. Teenage daughter Jess (Kristen Stewart) glowers like a junior league Avril Lavigne no one understands her because she speaks in fluent pout. Theres a toddler too named Benny (Evan Turner) whos a magnet for rotting spirits.The farmhouse is vintage Texas Chainsaw the crows in full murder creepy gray things are skittering in the basement. The scariest thing here though has to be John Corbett (""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"") with long hair and a skeevy fu manchu as a stranger who shows up at the house wielding a shotgun. Naturally the dad immediately hires him on as a farmhand.The Pangs are more into atmosphere and imagery than in plot logic and thats fine; if only their bag of tricks werent so shallow. Theyre big on ""boo"" scenes and playing with focal planes something icky is always passing by in the foreground or background of a shot as the soundtrack gooses you with sonic whooshes.Its a wholly mechanical approach to suspense and after a while you sit there in the dark and tick off the other movies that have been scavenged for spare parts ""The Amityville Horror"" ""The Shining"" ""The Birds"" ""The Others"" ""The Sixth Sense"" even a little bit of ""Close Encounters"" whenever baby Benny wanders down a hall toward a shrieking door.Stewart -- Jodie Fosters daughter in ""Panic Room"" -- is a good actress whos been directed to give a binary performance she toggles between sullen and scared. The grown-ups fare worse They speak . . . very . . . slowly . . . as if to pad the running time out. This may in fact be the most ridiculous performance John Corbett has ever given.The visuals stick with you -- a pair of mottled ghost-legs that appear under a sheet the mother is shaking out for instance -- and somewhere in ""The Messengers"" is a neat little metaphor about all the things a teenager sees and feels that no one wants to hear about. For subtext to work though you have to have some text on top of it. Instead ""The Messengers"" is textbook and the course its teaching is HSL Horror as a Second Language.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/movies/blog.
