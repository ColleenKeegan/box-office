Theres plenty of singing but unlike the TV version theres no spurious plot stringing the songs together. The downside is that theres no place here for the shows scene-stealing queen of mean Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch). But it does mean that the Glee concert experience - the show that entertained 150000 Gleeks when it touched down at the O2 earlier this year - is pure jukebox karaoke. The concert footage is great fun -hit after hit is enthusiastically and efficiently delivered by the shows perky young cast in character at all times. Rachel channels Barbra Streisand Brittany S Pierce does Britney Spears and everyone joins in for Dont Stop Believin .But the film falters when the cameras go off stage. Behind-the-scenes interview snippets though amusing are obviously scripted but at least theyre in keeping with the concert-doc format. Whats entirely unnecessary are the lengthy inserts following real-life Glee fans who have been inspired by the show to overcome adversity. So we meet a high-school student with dwarfism a gay teenager and an Aspergers sufferer who all learned that its okay to be different heartwarming/ nauseating stories depending on your threshold for American schmaltz. Either way they belong in a different documentary.Do-gooding aside unless youre the rare Glee fan who fast-forwards through the singing Glee The Concert Movie wont fail to entertain. But given that  the 3D adds nothing except a few streamers flying into the audience itll probably work better on DVD where you can bellow along in the privacy of your own home.

Not being a Gleek I approached ""Glee The 3D Concert Movie"" in a virginal state. (Where is Justin Bieber? Oops wrong movie.) Well Im still not a Gleek but I can see what all the fuss is about. This rousing documentary directed by Kevin Tancharoen and shot during two live concerts in New Jersey is a nonstop campy celebration of youthful pizazz. Most of the ""Glee"" performers who include Dianna Agron Amber Riley Kevin McHale Heather Morris and Darren Criss arent just hyperenergetic - they can really put on a show. My favorite numbers here are ""Dont Rain on My Parade"" by the brass-lunged Rachel (Lea Michele) - she may look like Streisand but her sound is her own - and a touching rendition of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" by Chris Colfer.A bit too much is made of how the ""Glee"" TV show has transformed the lives of its fans many of whom are interviewed at length in the course of the movie. I wonder What will become of them when the show is eventually canceled? Theres always reruns I guess. Grade B+ (Rated PG for thematic elements brief language and some sensuality.)

After all the film sends the cast of the TV show (in character) on the road to belt out songs made indelible by the Queen of Soul and Lady Gaga Journey and the Beatles Cee Lo Green and Katy Perry. So it helps to know the back story of William McKinley Highs New Directions singers Rachel Finn Puck Brittany Mercedes Santana Artie Mike Quinn Sam Tina and Lauren. And it cant hurt to know that Kurt and Blaine (the knockout Warbler from Dalton Academy) are boyfriends. That Brittany isnt the brightest bulb in the toolshed. Its good to have the skinny on the rakish Puck and his heavyweight squeeze Lauren. And it wouldnt hurt to be aware that Rachel has a Barbra Streisand thing. Although as portrayed by Lea Michele the songstress isnt gonna let you forget it. If however you are a ""Gleek"" (you know who you are and you are legion) then theres a very good chance that youll see this concert flick more than once before it ends its two-week run. Of course the ""3D"" in the title hawks that de rigueur technology. But the movie achieves true depth by intercutting its enjoyable song-and-dance numbers with a backstage mockumentary and a touchingly authentic documentary featuring three very different fans. ""Glee 3D"" feels better than good. It feels kind of smart. No wonder we cant stop believing. What follows are some random thoughts about this big-screen treat. 1. Where are Shuester and Silvester? Clearly the shows adults did something different on their summer vacation. Which turns out just fine. 2. Fan-demonium. Like the Justin Bieber ""Never Say Never"" doc ""Glee 3D"" has enough screaming teen and tween girls to defeat the most compassionate feminist. Get a life And for a brief moment the scads of age-appropriate fans -- shouting and confessing their undying love for Blaine or Kurt or Quinn -- made this middle-aged one want to crawl back into the ""Glee"" closet. But the movie makes a strong argument for the tender paradox of pop-culture adoration. Its an affection that feels wholly personal but is shared with millions. 3. Its deeper than it looks. Paging Roland Barthes Jean Baudrillard Jacques Derrida Calling all deceased French cultural theorists could you please come to the white courtesy phone? Your services are needed to tease out the fantastic tangle that ""Glee 3D"" makes out of the real-life the simulated and the hankered- for. There are interviews with ardent fans of all ages outside the concert venue. There are backstage moments full of smart-alecky asides and sidelong glances. And there is a documentary featuring three of the TV shows real fans. 4. Sly Stone was right ""Everybody is a star."" And real folk Janae Meraz Josey Pickering and Trenton Thompson are wondrous quasars. Sure their touching revelations about the TV shows impact on their lives serve the shows producers quite well. But they also offer a much-appreciated PSA about the value of difference. And not always in ways youd imagine. 5.The play(list) is the thing. From the opening moment in which New Directions belts out ""Dont Stop Believin"" wearing goofy blue polo shirts no less the concert is a greatest (covered) hits bonanza. But what fine multigenerational mashups ""Glee"" creates mixing jitterbug choreography with Santanas frisky version of ""Valerie"" or slowing down for Kurt and Rachel to reprise their heartbreaking duet of ""Get Happy"" and ""Happy Days Are Here Again."" 6.The technology remains overrated. Just revisit Martin Scorseses kinetic ""Shine a Light"" about the Rolling Stones at New Yorks Beacon Theatre if you need reminding that a concert film doesnt require 3-D specs. The 3-D here is a gilding a gimmick. Which doesnt mean that those few instances when a raised hand blocks your sightline arent kinda cool. (""Down in front"" we wanted to yell.) 7.Stay through the credits. Its a concert after all. Theres probably an encore.

Kevin Tancharoens energetic document of the popular Fox comedys 2011 spin-off tour (culled from two East Rutherford NJ performances) is chockablock with the series cheery karaoke delivering blandly choreographed renditions of crowd-pleaser tunes already featured on the program from ""Dont Stop Believing"" and ""Born This Way"" to ""Jessies Girl"" and ""Forget You"" the last of these courtesy of a cameoing Gwyneth Paltrow. Glees radio top 40-pilfering musical schizophrenia is exacerbated by this stage show which zigzags wildly from bubblegum rock to Ramp;B to Barbra Streisand along the way producing a few inappropriate moments such as bad girl Britneys sexualized rendition of ""Im a Slave 4 U"" mere moments after a shot of a cheery adolescent audience member. Interwoven into the song-and-dance footage are paltry backstage snippets of the cast as well as cursory real-life stories of fans (a cheerleading dwarf a gay high-schooler a girl with Aspergers Syndrome) that underline Glees be-yourself-and-be-proud empowerment ethos. Toss in irrelevant 3D effects and its merely a trivial footnote to the popular franchise--though one that will no doubt satisfy rabid gleeks Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Nick Schager Follow nschager Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

One of the many self-actualized real-life Gleeks featured in ""Glee The 3-D Concert Movie"" tells the audience ""Be proud of yourself. Dont be afraid. Stand up for what you believe in."" OK. I stand for hating ""Glee."" This filmed record of the concert tour featuring stars of the excruciating TV show equals 90 minutes of thundering cuteness that made me feel like the guy in ""127 Hours."" Midway through I looked at my watch and couldnt believe it was still August. When the screen explodes with slushy soft drinks over the end credits its the least sticky-sweet aspect of the entire experience. Fine for fans? Sure. This stuff is crack for fans. Crack is really bad Most of the cast members are here (but wheres the guy who plays the teacher?) doing group dance routines that have been used in every pop video since the 1980s and belting out Vegas-y covers of 80s crap (""Dont Stop Believin "") soul-free soul (""River Deep Mountain High"") and would-be anthems of the oppressed like ""Born This Way."" Really? You were born annoying? I dont dispute that these young people can produce smiles visible from space or sing out loudly enough to crack cement; I ask merely that they refrain from doing so in my vicinity. Among the highlights Former movie star and country songbird Gwyneth Paltrow turns up to do ""Forget You"" as Gleeks in the audience reminisce about being fetuses the last time she had a hit in theaters. A guy who has spent the show in a wheelchair is moved to walk again by the inspirational power of ""Safety Dance."" The actress playing Brittany noting the 3-D element says of the audience ""I hope they have an overwhelming sensation about my boobs."" Small chance of that; the audience is delirious with estrogen. Also there are lots of females present. The ""Glee"" bubblegum posse even dares to (literally) trot out a cover of ""Empire State of Mind"" as mock graffiti lights up the digital video screen in the background. But speaking as a taxpaying resident of the concrete jungle where dreams are made of we need these dorks to cheer for us the way we need Jay-Z to teach grammar. The smiley men of ""Glee"" -- conceivably the only group of young Americans who could be beaten up by the Jonas Brothers (and to witness that I would gladly buy a ticket maybe even supply weapons) -- flit about in matching blazers. One of them appears to be wearing a cardboard white bow tie with a flowered shirt while reworking ""I Want To Hold Your Hand"" as a dreamy torch song. Its all sheer Ivy League Whiffenpoofery of the kind that made me wince and cover my ears for four years and is an excellent argument for a Texas Aamp;M education. But yes it must be admitted that the movie makes the most of the irresistible charms of the winsome starlet Lea Michele as Rachel she of the plus-sized nose and redwood-felling soprano. A middle-aged fan interviewed outside the concert arena says she adores Michele because ""Shes very Barbra Streisand-esque."" You mean -- brunette? Bouncing along Tiggerishly in a polka-dot skirt or sitting on a stool in a sailor shirt crooning ""Happy Days Are Here Again"" she radiates so much New Jersey niceness that my advanced loathing systems were momentarily disabled. She sings ""Firework"" -- she is a firework -- with so much brutal charm that Im secretly planning an excursion to Hot Topic to hear the song again. The concert is broken up with profiles of fans such as a dwarf cheerleader (who becomes prom queen and is seen dancing with her normal-sized date while hes on his knees) and a gay teen (who was outed against his will in eighth grade but is otherwise happy). Each of them shares with us personal stories -- their adventures in achieving high self-esteem against surmountable odds. ""Were all different"" is the message. Yes and in exactly the same way no? Its hard to picture anyone in ""Glee"" going fishing or fixing your transmission.

And I report this as a former geeky high school alto who is if not a Gleek at least Glee friendly. To fluff up what is essentially a raggedy recording of the recently concluded brand-extending North American tour known as Glee Live In Concert the movie intersperses musical numbers with selected inspirational stories about fans whose lives have improved because of their devotion to the show. These happy excited aficionados see the world differently now They realize that there are no Losers just all kinds of different people And thats cool A peppy dwarf cheerleader identifies with the Cheerios of fictional William McKinley High School; a gay young man finds inspiration in the courage of fictional Kurt (Chris Colfer) to be himself; an outsider with Aspergers syndrome thinks of fictional Brittany (Heather Morris) as her best friend and in turn finds real friendship in the fellowship of other Gleeks. The positive power of a TV show to encourage tolerance and compassion among its viewers is a wonderful thing. But these ""success stories"" tilt uncomfortably toward self-congratulation on the part of the producers; certainly they register as overkill for the intended audience who presumably already know how awesome it is that theres a place in the high school universe where students as different as Artie (Kevin McHale) in his wheelchair Mercedes (Amber Riley) the plus-sized diva and Puck (Mark Salling) the bullying football player can all find joy singing covers of Lady Gaga and Beyonce hits. As for the concert itself its a generically big loud overchoreographed over-miced post-Madonna production programmed with songs to get the whole audience singing screaming and waving oversized red foam-rubber Glee hands that form the shows trademark letter L. Directed by Kevin Tancharoen (Fame) the movies 3D-ness adds nothing except the strange sense that the cast is performing in front of a painted backdrop rather than in front of actual deliriously happy Gleeks.

(Handout) Joe Neumaier Friday August 12 2011 400 AM Title Glee the 3D Concert Movie With Lea Michele Chris Colfer Heather Morris Amber Riley. Actors from the TV show perform as their characters. Director Kevin Tancharoen (123). PG. At area theaters.A lot of gleeful audience members are interviewed in ""Glee The 3-D Concert Experience"" though the source of their happiness could be a lot of things.Maybe its the chance to see the actors from their favorite TV show live on stage. Or perhaps they knew Gwyneth Paltrow would make a singing cameo complete with sneer.Some fans might have anticipated the confetti-flying finish since the use of 3-D is otherwise unnecessary.It remains a mystery if they knew it was really a group of fictional creations performing onstage at New Jerseys Izod Center a couple of months ago.The most frequently voiced idea is that the members of ""Glees"" make-believe New Directions ensemble remind so-called Gleeks -- and we follow several during this 83-minute movie -- of themselves.Thats to be expected since the hit prime-time musical-comedy soap champions the underdog. Prancing around in Izod shirts prior to a few wardrobe changes the overall vibe is generic high school from ""Dont Stop Believin"" at the opening through every number performed by ""Brittany"" ""Blaine"" ""Santana"" and the rest. (If you know who they are you know that theyre here. And they use their TV names so we will too.)The gang zooms through Alicia Keys ""Empire State of Mind"" which to them surely means the Mamp;M store in Times Square despite a Robert De Niro shoutout; ""Raise Your Glass"" and ""Silly Love Songs."" (The less said about ""River Deep Mountain High"" the better.) Note that most pieces either skip a verse or are joined already in progress.Kurt who mouths ""Hi"" after every line sings ""Get Happy"" and Puck sings ""Fat-Bottomed Girls"" both free of satire. Barbra Streisand-loving Rachel who gets Michele Bachmann eyes when excited belts out ""Dont Rain on My Parade"" pretty well.""Thank you for loving me"" says a ""Glee"" boy to the crowd though its unclear if he means himself as an actor or his character since we see them interviewed backstage as their alter-egos complete with sassy rivalries and camaraderie.But fans love it. Every ""Glee""-kateer has a Special Moment of adoration from Gleeks three of whom get mini-profiles A cheerleader who describes herself as a ""dwarf"" and a ""Cheerio""; a boy who came out in eighth grade and a young woman with Asberger syndrome. They celebrate and sing of themselves and credit ""Glee"" for helping them do that.Which is one of arts beautiful benefits and if something gets people to raise their glass rock on. But theres something a little off about a stage show that features well-paid actors reenacting ""loser"" characters such fans take to heart before leaving in what were surely limos and jets.At one point ""Artie"" the wheelchair-bound member of New Directions stops spinning to say ""Everyone has a dream and this is mine"" before getting up and strutting around to ""The Safety Dance"" (the films best number by the way).Is he making sure non-Gleeks know that Artie the dork is only a role he plays? No matter apparently; he then gets back into his pretend wheelchair and everyone cheers.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Starring Dianna Agron Lea Michele Chris Colfer Cory Monteith Darren Criss Chord Overstreet Heather Morris Kevin McHale Naya Rivera Mark Salling Director Kevin Tancharoen Running time 140 Release Opened Aug 12 2011  Editorial Review Big screen big voices little elseBy Jen ChaneyFriday Aug 12 2011In the two years since ""Glee"" premiered on Fox it has evolved from a quirky TV series about show choir oddballs to a revenue-generating pop culture juggernaut one that has spawned 11 CDs a series of young adult novels multiple DVD box sets two concert tours and a reality show spin-off. Now we have the apparent next step in the ""Glee""-volution ""Glee The 3D Concert Movie"" a 90-minute multi-dimensional ""Glee""-a-thon that contains highlights from a recent stop at New Jerseys Meadowlands during this summers ""Glee"" tour. Filled with infectiously energetic renditions of pop tunes plucked straight from the repertoires of the shows competitive crooning groups the New Directions and the Warblers - from Journeys ""Dont Stop Believin "" to Pinks ""Raise Your Glass"" - the movie is entertaining and admittedly completely unnecessary. Yes it works well enough in theaters. But it also would have worked just as well as a heavily promoted special television event broadcast over Thanksgiving weekend. Of course hard-core ""Glee"" fans will undoubtedly give it two thumbs up as it delivers the key things they desire from a ""Glee"" movie a chance to watch their favorite cast members (Kurt Santana Brittany) perform ""Born This Way"" on a much larger screen and to get even closer to this seasons breakout heartthrob Darren Criss courtesy of 3-D technology. Slightly less committed Gleeks on the other hand will likely tap their feet while simultaneously wondering why they just paid upwards of 14 for a ticket to see something they can get every week for free. (By the way Gleeks here are some answers to your inevitable questions yes Chord Overstreet is featured in the movie even though hes been booted off the show. And yes Jane Lynchs Sue Sylvester - the track-suited tyrannical cheerleading coach and noted anti-glee clubber - really was cut from the film.) The ""Glee"" movie may be a concert flick but director Kevin Tancharoen has sprinkled it with liberal dashes of the documentary ""American Teen"" shoehorning vignettes about young ""Glee"" fans - including a high school cheerleader who also happens to be a little person and a gay 19-year-old who recalls his struggles with coming out - between all of those covers of Queen and Cee Lo Green. All of this is naturally designed to celebrate the core principles of the ""Glee"" ethos that no matter how unconventional you might be you are worthy of love and the opportunity to belt out a Katy Perry song in an exceedingly large arena. But in the case of Josey an Asperger syndrome sufferer so obsessed with ""Glee"" that the names of her dog cat and car were all ripped from the show there are some genuinely touching moments particularly when she speaks through tears about how her admiration of ""Glees"" Brittany S. Pierce (Heather Morris) helped her to socially engage again. "" Glee is like my medicine"" she says at one point. On the other hand footage of a 3-year-old boy who mimics Crisss dance moves even donning an itty-bitty navy Dalton Academy blazer with red trim will be viewed as utterly adorable or as evidence that a watchdog group specifically devoted to premature ""Glee"" exposure needs to be formed ASAP. While ""Glee"" fans provide some fun diversions in ""Glee The 3D Concert Movie"" the main event is really the cast members and their vocal cords. And they do not disappoint. If nothing else this motion picture is further proof that ""Glees"" stars are immensely talented as evidenced by among other fine performances Amber Rileys ability to fill all the available air in the Meadowlands with her tsunami of a voice during Aretha Franklins ""Aint No Way."" Oh and if you dont get a chill up your spine when Lea Michele sings ""Dont Rain on My Parade"" from ""Funny Girl"" call your chiropractor. You might be missing a spine. In the end ""Glee The 3D Concert Movie"" is actually a perfect representation of ""Glee"" the TV show At its best its joyful uplifting and even occasionally moving. And at its worst its a propaganda piece designed to win our undying loyalty to a TV show/cash cow that advocates for the little guy even though its clearly turned into a diva. Contains some thematic elements brief language and some sensuality but nothing more objectionable than one sees on an episode of ""Glee.""

"As a concert movie Glee is a little off-key - USATODAY.com Skip to Main Content USA TODAY Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather As a concert movie Glee is a little off-key By Scott Bowles USA TODAY Posted Comments Reprints amp; Permissions Glee the TV show has become a cult phenom with three essential ingredients whip-smart kids adult-sized issues all blended to sugary pop tunes. By Adam Rose 20th Century Fox Onstage theyre the popular kids Chord Overstreet left Kevin McHale Cory Monteith and Lea Michele stay in character during the show. EnlargeClose By Adam Rose 20th Century Fox Onstage theyre the popular kids Chord Overstreet left Kevin McHale Cory Monteith and Lea Michele stay in character during the show. About a third of those components made it into Glee The 3D Concert Movie. You wont find many wiseacre kids or heavy topics in this documentary of the Glee Live In Concert tour. Instead the movie is exactly as advertised energized shiny happy hit-laden and featuring kids in some of their same TV get-ups. STORY Can Glee get standing ovation at the box office? PHOTOS Get happy with a Glee gallery This is welcome news if you are a member of Gleek nation. Its another matter if you dont know who is singing. Or what inspired the songs. Or how this TV show became the emblem of outcast youth. Thats not much to ask -- even Justin Biebers Never Say Never touched on the boys YouTube beginnings. On this whirlwind tour there is no room for context when youve got twentysomethings running the stage belting ditties such as Dont Stop Believin and Fat Bottomed Girls-- songs parents can stand and kids can listen to because pretty people sing them. About the movie Glee The 3D Concert Movie  out of fourStars Lea Michele Cory Monteith Chris Colfer Darren Criss Dianna Agron Naya RiveraDirector Kevin TancharoenDistributor 20th Century Fox Rating PG for thematic elements brief language and some sensuality Running time 1 hour 40 minutes Opens Friday nationwide And the Gleek nation is on full display. Parents dance in the stands harder than their kids. Regular kids arent identified though they are quoted about how watching the TV show has given them the strength to come out of the closet be themselves and face family. Even as a concert movie there are some stumbles. As he has done on the show Artie (played by Kevin McHale) leaves his wheelchair in a dream sequence. Its jarring onstage particularly as he ""breaks"" to Safety Dance. And Glee faves Will (Matthew Morrison) and Emma (Jayma Mays) dont make it into the film but a cameo star (Gwyneth Paltrow) does? And never has a movie had less need for 3-D other than to jack up prices. But for a spinoff movie Glee delivers the goods to its faithful. Not all summer films can claim the same.

"Glee The 3D Concert Movie Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review Glee The 3D Concert MovieThe young stars of Foxs hit TV show sure can sing and dance but the hullabaloo might be lost on anyone who isnt a Gleek.August 12 2011|By Robert Abele Special to the Los Angeles Times Kurt (Chris Colfer left) Mercedes (Amber Riley) and Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz)... (Adam Rose / Twentieth Century...)If the weekly musical comedy TV series ""Glee"" is a belted aria calling for outsider inclusivity ""Glee The 3D Concert Movie"" plays like a coded jamboree for club members only. Which means if you arent a ""Gleek"" a to use the terminology for the shows fans a you might still appreciate the talent on display and the energetically sung playlist of arena pop and musical theater nuggets but be lost as to why Gwyneth Paltrow is there singing Cee Lo Greens ""Forget You"" or why a nerdy-looking young paraplegic is suddenly on his feet for a rousingly choreographed version of the 80s hit ""Safety Dance."" Duh thats Artie Or Kevin McHale as wheelchair-bound Artie re-creating a fantasy sequence from the show. And Gwynnie played a sexy substitute teacher last season See Gleeks dont need to be told that the live ""Glee"" concept a as it swung through cities earlier this year a was a showcase done in character numbers from the series writ large. (The movie directed for maximum teen-screamage by Kevin Tancharoen was culled from two Izod Center shows in East Rutherford N.J.) Advance knowledge isnt required however to determine which cast members are musical talents and who has benefited from prime-time production values. Lea Micheles self-regarding Rachel and Cory Monteiths sensitive jock Finn may share an off-and-on romantic story line on television but the stars respective pipes and stage presences arent equals as Micheles soaring Broadway-ready rendition of ""Dont Rain on My Parade"" attests. Concert movies once reveled in being visually static The idea was to capture lightning in a bottle a the experience of being there a with an emphasis on long loving close-ups. Nowadays as ""Glee The 3D Concert Movie"" makes clear any expression of human energy onstage is met full force by breathless camera work a swooping in on wires circling the performers and tracking restlessly back and forth a all flash-edited so that watching the movie is now nothing like having been there. If you caught the ""Glee"" tour it probably didnt involve ziplining into the action or getting to bounce around onstage. The 3-D meanwhile is negligibly bedazzling when the high-wattage charm of natural showman Darren Criss a leading all-male group the Warblers as Blaine a and the effortlessly appealing Chris Colfer as Kurt already pop off the screen. Another of the movies strengths is the showcasing of cast members with dance training like McHale Heather Morris and Harry Shum Jr. The gifted Shum gets favored by the camera frequently during choreographer Zach Woodlees dance routines while Morris a whose deadpan timing as ditzy cheerleader Brittany is a show standout a shines in her pumped-up version of Britney Spears ""Im a Slave 4 U."" Interspersed throughout are filmed shoutouts from concertgoers and field pieces about fans including an ebullient teenage dwarf cheerleader and a young gay male with a tale about overcoming embarrassment. The ""Glee""-serving nature of these otherwise heartwarming interludes is a tad distracting. But for the shows rabid viewership these testimonials are probably integral to a celebratory experience like the ""Glee"" live show. To everyone else its all gonna be Gleek to you. calendarlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESRihanna shines at GQs Men of the Year 2012 bashNovember 14 2012Critics Notebook The Glee machineMay 23 2011Television review GleeSeptember 21 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesEntertainmentLea MicheleDarren CrissCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-glee-20110812,0,686450.story?track=rss",200,gleethe3dconcertmovie12,gleethe3dconcertmovie,latimes

""Glee"" is the gift that keeps on giving to Fox as well as its fans. Since its 2009 debut the musical TV series has spawned legions of fans a half-dozen CDs a reality show and a pair of concert tours. And now comes the inevitable concert pic a fan-friendly extravaganza culled from this summers sold-out tour. Slated for a brief theatrical release ""Glee The 3D Concert Movie"" is compulsory viewing for all Gleeks mitigating withdrawal pangs until the third season begins. Pic may offer little appeal to anyone who thinks ""Gleek"" is a typo but even the uninitiated could do a lot worse than this 80-minute musical valentine to the outsider in us all. A blend of concert footage interstitial fan segments and faux behind-the-scenes snippets (the actors remain in character) pic avoids going the ""Justin Bieber Never Say Never"" route of documenting the cast members rise to stardom. Nor does it offer much in the way of surprises. Instead the goal is largely to provide the Glee Live concert event for those who missed the recent tour an immersive experience enhanced by fan testimonials about the series positive impact on their lives. As tempting as it is to label this approach over-calculated and self-congratulatory its virtually impossible not to be swept up in the surge of ebullience and affection. As one fan attests "" Glee is like medicine."" Adds another ""Its like the playlist of my life."" Under the watchful eye of producer/co-creator Ryan Murphy helmer Kevin Tanchareon (""Fame"") plays to ""Glees"" strengths. In this regard hes abetted by editors Myron I. Kerstein Jane Moran and Tatiana S. Regal who selected numbers from several concert appearances (mostly two June dates in New Jersey). Many of the shows hits are featured from covers of 80s hits like ""Dont Stop Believin?"" to Lady Gagas ""Born This Way"" to the shows own composition ""Loser Like Me."" A pitch-perfect Rachel (Lea Michele) emotes with ""Dont Rain on My Parade;"" hunky Finn (Cory Monteith) elicits swoons with ""Jessies Girl""; smokin hot Brittany (the dazzling Heather Morris) covers ""Im a Slave 4 U"" better than Britney Spears herself and so forth. Nearly everyone gets his or her moment centerstage. Interspersed with the energetic musical numbers are fan commentaries three of which are given special attention. A young woman with Asperger syndrome explains how ""Glee"" has helped her come our of her shell; a cheerleading dwarf describes how its message of acceptance encouraged her to overcome her feelings of being different; and a young man movingly recalls how Kurt (Chris Colfer) the shows gay character has given him the strength to come out. Though these could have done without re-enactments each of these stories in its own way offers an inspiring parable about tolerance and self-empowerment. For a film that was put together so rapidly it doesnt look at all shoddy (except for a couple of frames near the end shot from the giantscreen instead of the stage). The 3D effect however is largely superfluous until the final credits when the shows trademark blue slushie heads straight for the viewer. On that note you might leave ""Glee 3D"" feeling a little gooey all over but that slushie does taste kind of sweet.

For the movie to work it either needed to be a straight-out no-holds-barred concert or an encapsulated version of the TV show with some sort of storyline or thematic thread to tie together the songs and characters.Filmmaker Kevin Tancharoen awkwardly tries to have it both ways. He keeps the actor-singer-dancers in character during the concert numbers and shows backstage snippets in which for instance Rachel (Lea Michele) reveals her diva-esque pre-show rituals and Brittany (movie MVP Heather Morris) issues vapid utterances about how great her breasts look in 3-D.The staying-in-character thing particularly annoys in the case of Plano native Kevin McHale who portrays Artie who uses a wheelchair. Although theres most likely not a single person watching who doesnt know that McHale can walk he spends nearly the entire movie in his chair. In his big dream sequence ""Safety Dance"" he proves himself such a fabulous dancer that its all the more shameful that hes mostly kept out of the action.Taken out of the TV shows context the songs seem lackluster. Even Chris Colfer whose rendition of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" was an emotional highlight last season seems bored and uninterested (we could have used more of the jazz-hands sassy version of his character).Michele makes vast use of her patented ""Im in pain"" look while expertly tiresomely hitting the high notes and Cory Monteith looks excruciatingly uncomfortable in his solo of ""Jessies Girl."" The stars who make the movie moderately worthwhile are Morris whose version of ""Im a Slave 4 U"" is a sexy showstopper and Dallas native Mark Salling whose ""Fat Bottomed Girls"" lets him show off his inner rock star to great effect.The movies other saving grace is the interweaving of concert numbers with the stories of three real-life Gleeks -- a cheerleader whose dwarf stature cant diminish her outsized personality a real-life Kurt who came out (unwillingly) as gay in eighth grade and a girl with Aspergers syndrome who has found a peer group in fellow fans.The 3-D by the way is pointless and frequently irritating. Did they really have to use 3-D to show waving arms cellphones and cameras popping up in front of us? It did make it lifelike I suppose -- every bit as bothersome as being at a concert where the person in front of you never sits down.Glee The 3D Concert MovieC- Starring Chris Colfer Lea Michele Cory Monteith Heather Morris Gwyneth Paltrow Amber Riley.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint To consider viewing anything ""Glee""- related much less a big-screen 3-D extravaganza you must accept -- no embrace -- the undeniable cheese. Always endearing sometimes irritating the characters of the hit TV show (turned concert tour turned 3-D concert movie) never cease to inspire the eye roll the I-cant-believe-Im-still-watching-this realization thats just not profound enough to make you change the channel. ""Glee The 3D Concert Movie"" is exactly what it purports to be a live concert filmed in 3-D so that familiar slushie-in-the-face (the punishment bullies impose on glee-club members almost daily) is more startling than ever. Add streamers fireworks fog and misunderstood diva Rachel Berrys face to the objects jumping off the screen and you get the feeling that youre actually there with the best seat in the house. Viewers will of course be separated into two camps -- ""gleeks"" and everyone else. For ""Glee"" lovers -- even those who already attended the live concert -- the movie is a must-see. Backstage documentary-like moments in which actors are casually in character feed our admittedly irrational but unending desire to believe theyre real people. And stories of inspired fans woven throughout will make viewers feel a part of the ""Glee"" family. (More cheese. But hey as one concert attendee states in the film ""Were the majority. Were the quirky weird kids."") GLEE THE 3D CONCERT MOVIE  out of 4 stars Rating PG RottenTomatoes.com read reviews Showtimes view listings For those who havent been caught up in the Fox TV guilty pleasure the concert delivers the best part -- the music. Between the embellished numbers where ""Glee"" favorites Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) and the lot perform show tunes and pop songs from the hit shows two seasons filmmakers fortify the bubblegum by spotlighting three concertgoers who were particularly inspired by ""Glee."" One is Janae who despite being a dwarf joins her high school cheerleading team -- the coach very unlike Sue Sylvester admits shes their secret weapon because her size makes her a flier -- and then earns the title ""prom princess."" Trenton is a gay teenager who was bullied mocked and forced to change schools when he was outed in eighth grade. And Josey suffers from Asperger syndrome a form of autism that causes extreme social anxiety. These three tell their stories and describe how watching ""Glee"" showed them that theyre not the only ones who are different that being the underdog should be celebrated that they want to inspire others in the way that the show inspired them. Cheese cheese cheese. And we eat it up.

The film opens in theaters on Aug. 12. (AP Photo/Dan Steinberg) When the TV show ""Glee"" started two years ago it stood out for its combination of sharp dialogue compelling story lines and well-chosen songs. The show has faltered a bit but the franchise has expanded quickly with albums tours car commercials and even a spinoff competition show. With ""Glee The 3D Concert Movie"" enough is enough. Even die-hard fans will cover their ears in protest.The film combines a hodgepodge of elements. Concert scenes from the cast tour are interspersed with interviews with the actors in character and footage of real fans gushing about how much they love the show.The result is more like a long commercial than a cohesive movie and the omissions are glaring. Offstage Rachel (Lea Michele) Santana (Naya Rivera) Brittany (Heather Morris) and Artie (Kevin McHale) get some screen time but Kurt (Chris Colfer) appears only in the background and main character Finn (Cory Monteith) is nowhere to be found. And while the Warblers and Gwyneth Paltrow make appearances theres no Sue Sylvester or Will Schuester anywhere including in cast-performed concert numbers that are nearly identical to ones on the show -- same choreography same costumes same expressions. The actors dont react much to each other onstage and spontaneous moments are hard to find.The film is padded with fan testimonials many shots of screaming crowds and vignettes of three teens who tell how ""Glee"" has inspired them. The 3-D effects are hardly noticeable except for giving the performers some visual pop. If youre a big fan of ""Glee"" a better way to get your fix is to watch ""The Glee Project"" on Oxygen (8 p.m. Sundays). That show has the heart thats missing from this drawn-out piece of marketing.

Review The film reminds us that News Corp. product-pushing aside the hit shows up-with-the-underdog message resonates with its fan base Back in 1953 when Howard Hughes was using Jane Russells obvious frontal attributes as a selling point for her films the posters for her first 3D movie ""The French Line"" promised ""Shell knock BOTH your eyes out"" Cut to nearly 60 years later and now weve got ""Glee"" star Heather Morris telling the camera that her boobs (her word not mine) will look great in 3D and then proving it by provocatively shimmying up to the camera for ""Glee The 3-D Concert Movie."" And no ones gotten quite the same mileage out of the stereoscopic process since the curvy Ms. Russell with the possible exception of the ""Piranha 3D"" day-players. Also read Review Glee 3D Soundtrack All of which is to say The producers were wise enough to throw in something that would attract actual straight guys -- not widely known as a bloc to be part of the ""Glee"" demographic -- to the theater. Savvy marketing is nothing new for the brain trust behind ""Glee"" of course -- the concert tour and subsequent film both keeps the fans fired up over the summer hiatus and provides an opportunity for yet another chart-topping soundtrack album -- but ""Glee The 3D Concert Movie"" reminds us that News Corp. product-pushing aside the hit shows up-with-the-underdog message resonates with its fan base. In between musical numbers we get to know three teens whose lives were changed by ""Glee"" -- a cheerleader and prom queen who happens to be a dwarf (again her word not mine) a gay guy forced out of the closet when the contents of his journal became public and a girl with Aspergers whose ""Gleek""-dom helped her interact with others. Also read Glees Chord Overstreet Time for Summer and Starting Fresh The editors were savvy enough to keep these interludes short and sweet so that the film can focus on the musical performances and with talented folks like Morris teen-heartthrob vocalist Darren Criss and Harry Shum Jr. (whose dance-your-face-off skills get as much mileage out of 3-D as Morris decolletage) thats enough to make the movie work. Not all of the ""Glee"" folk get equal time -- and they remain in character for the backstage interviews a baffling choice -- so if youre a fan of Jenna Ushkowitz Chord Overstreet or Ashley Fink consider yourself warned. Still the ones who do sing (as well as an unbilled special guest star) do right by the tunes theyre covering with the notable exception of Cory Monteiths butchery of ""Jessies Girl."" (His number tops the chart of Best Time to Hit the Restroom.) Musicals have gotten somewhat short shrift among the new millennial 3D movies and when we do get them they rarely take full advantage of that third dimension the Jonas Brothers and Justin Bieber docs had a certain you-are-there quality to them but little else to shout about while ""Step Up 3-D"" was singularly lacking in sneaker soles hitting you in the nose. With the ""Glee"" movie director Kevin Tancharoen (previously responsible for the lifeless ""Fame"" remake) kicks things up a notch making viewers feel not only like theyve got the best seat in the house but also like theyre part of the chorus. Granted if you lack even the tiniest amount of fondness for ""Glee"" this movie isnt going to win you over. But if you prefer your Katy Perry songs sung by Lea Michele or the Warblers youre in for a seat-dancing good time. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Daily Edition Login to download Glee The 3D Concert Movie Film Review 133 PM PDT 8/11/2011 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Twentieth Century Fox A bouncy but routine concert film highlighted by a few fine song performances. TWITTER The fast-paced concert film sprinkles only a few highlights of real musical talent through an otherwise blatant pat-on-the-back montage. A self-congratulatory air envelopes Glee The 3D Concert Movie a blatant commodity designed to illustrate what a splendid influence the hit television show has been on the world at large if the series creators dont mind saying so themselves. Not a moment too short at 84 minutes this pacy compendium interlards two dozen musical numbers with testimonials from fans and cast members about how amazing Glee is a claim only momentarily backed up by this routinely made promo item. Whatever initial theatrical success the Fox release might enjoy will be short-lived. Having pride in yourself no matter who or what you are lies at the heart of Glees purpose and appeal as stated and restated by many of the ""Gleeks"" among the shrieking multitudes at two recorded shows at the Izod Center in East Rutherford N.J. Playing to what looks like about an 80 per cent female audience the young performers are filmed in such a conventional straightforward manner that the third dimension adds virtually nothing to the experience -- which might be noted by some of the customers who pay a surcharge for what in this case is entirely a promotional gimmick. VIDEO Glee The 3D Concert Movie Red Carpet Premiere Initially identified so quickly as to be unhelpful to the uninitiated (for whom this film will be a distinct non-event anyway) the cast members are nothing if not bouncy; in fact by far the most common move in Zachary Woodlees choreography is bouncing up and down in place. Even a touch of self-deprecating humor would have gone a long way to balancing out the self-satisfied braggadocio of some of the singer-dancers who are generally boastful in inverse ratio to their evident talent. In fact some of them particularly the women exhibit real musical flair in a concert setting. The one genuinely electrifying number is Lea Micheles rendition of ""Dont Rain on My Parade."" In an interview at the outset Michele emotionally confesses her idol worship of Barbra Streisand and her ability to channel and essentially reproduce Babs phrasings and sheer sonic power is almost uncanny. STORY Glee the 3D Concert Movie Track-By-Track Another born belter is Amber Riley who has likely already heard the Jennifer Hudson comparisons for years but wows the audience with her soulful range and expressiveness. Naya Rivera impresses in a more subtle sultry register. Toward the end the TV shows occasional guest star Gwyneth Paltrow skips on for an agreeable enough stint. Several of the boys have fine clear voices but none at this point suggests the potential of the best girls as a breakout solo act. As on the show the song selections cut across the pop and less so show tunes catalogs with upbeat quasi-inspirational choices in forefront. ""Were the quirky weird kids"" one of the many geeky fans testifies on camera and all the interstitial material is devoted to illuminating how much Glee has meant to misfits outsiders young gays and anyone who considers themselves ""different."" The two high schoolers offering the lengthiest personal accounts of adversity overcome are a cheery female dwarf who became a star cheerleader and was invited by a football player to the prom where she was voted queen and a gay fellow who was unwillingly yanked out of the closet in eighth grade but is now an exemplar of gay pride. In this way this feel-good concert movie goes to great lengths to insist what a great thing Glee has been during its two years on the air but this document itself will be but a footnote to its legacy.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Confession Im losing my religion when it comes to Glee. Ryan Murphys hit TV series produces so many highs like Rachel and Kurts to-die-for duet on the Broadway set of Wicked that the frequent lows can be forgiven even by non-Gleeks. Still Im calling bullshit on this 3D concert movie. In June most of the cast began a summer tour that would allow the fans to genuflect. You heard me. The movie plays like an evangelical prayer meeting though Id hold the hallelujahs. The characters we came to admire as vulnerable misfits hit the stage like visiting royalty and with a nonstop perkiness that makes the Von Trapps look like manic-depressives. Lea Michele (Rachel) Amber Riley (Mercedes) and Darren Criss (Blaine) do the heavy vocal lifting. Others climb aboard the Auto-Tune express while the caffeinated camera zigzags madly across the stage avoiding any singer whose lips dont match the words. The audience cheers wildly no matter what. Even more problematic are the offstage interviews with fans whose lives have been changed by Glee. They include a gay teen a dwarf cheerleader and a girl with Aspergers. Praiseworthy indeed. What grates is the hard sell the see-me touch-me buy-me vibe that suggest were taking the holy waters. Thank the gods of sass that hottie Heather Morris (Brittany) is around to opine that the (otherwise useless) 3D makes her boobs look awesome. Chris Colfer (gay bullied but unbowed Kurt) is haunting singing ""I Want to Hold Your Hand."" Hes the best actor on the show with the exception of Emmy winner Jane Lynch (Coach Sue Sylvester) who only appears in the trailer. Crazy huh? ""Please save your money"" snipes Sue ""this thing sucks."" Its meant as a joke. But what I hear is the cold snap of truth.

You downloaded all the music. You went to the sold out arena tour. Now thrill to Glee The 3D Concert Movie. More about Glee the 3D Concert Movie >> The Fox TV phenomenon is the Lewis amp; Clark of discovering new revenue streams. And this big-screen iteration is just as buoyant and bright-eyed as the rest of the franchise. The opening number fittingly is ""Dont Stop Believin"" the rock boulder that got the whole Glee landslide rolling. Its breathlessly followed by nearly two dozen more songs that have popped up on the TV series. Most of the vocal tracks and backing arrangements are prerecorded. And some of the cast (Lea Michele) are better at lip-synching than others (Naya Rivera). But even if the music is canned it still sounds remarkably fresh. The choreography for the 14-member main troupe is rudimentary. Most of the time they do-si-do on stage content just to not step on each others toes. The principals with actual dance training - Heather Morris and Harry Shum Jr. - stand out like deer in a bison herd. Its not surprising that the most visually exciting number in the film ""Im a Slave 4 U"" features Morris Brittany getting her Britney on. Thats because it looks like a big pop-production number. Part of Glees charm has always been its innocent amateurishness its just-folks aura. The live show clings to that conceit - with some pyrotechnics thrown in. The camera work is fantastic although the sequences flaunting the 3-D spatial effects may unsettle your stomach. Interwoven with the concert footage are mini-profiles of three rabid if unconventional fans including Janae Meraz a real-life high school Cheerio who stands four feet tall. These fan vignettes try to frame Gleeks as a big tribe of misfits who gain therapeutic value and a sense of community from watching the show. The cast stays in character throughout the film both on and backstage. With one notable exception At the start of ""Safety Dance"" (from one-hit wonders Men Without Hats) Artie (Kevin McHale) jumps up from his wheelchair and starts capering vigorously. You have to wonder what the producers thought they were gaining by shattering the illusion so capriciously. Especially since Artie stays in his chair throughout his other big showcase Michael Jacksons ""PYT."" However vibrant and eclectic the playlist a nonstop cavalcade of songs would likely fade like a sugar buzz. So Glee 3D packs a pair of booster rockets that ignite at just the right times. The first is a medley by Blaine (Darren Criss) and the Warblers. His rousing rendition of Pinks ""Raise Your Glass"" is one of the films musical highlights. And the second bonus . . . well I dont want to spoil the surprise. Lets just say a certain language substitute teacher returns. Like all things Glee this concert film is a deceptively slick package. And a diabolically clever way to pick your pocket once again. Dont forget to buy the soundtrack. Contact staff writer David Hiltbrand at 215-854-4552 or dhiltbrandphillynews.com.

Just dont think of it as especially entertaining after the initial sugar fizz of the opening Dont Stop Believin wears off -- unless you are a card-carrying Gleek and you still dot your is with big hearts. If you have to ask Whos Stuart Smalley? youre probably beyond the demographic for this admittedly good-natured perky concert movies audience. But like that popular 20-old Saturday Night Live skit which featured satirist Al Franken as a relentlessly cheerful sexually ambiguous self-help therapist Glee The 3D Concert Movie goes overboard with its message that Hey youre OK just the way you are So in between live performances from this summers Glee arena tour of classic rock oldies and Lady Gaga (Born This Way of course cuz Hey youre OK just the way you are) we meet real teens like Janae Meraz a 16-old Californian born with achondroplasia a bone disorder that leads to dwarfism who speaks of triumphing over challenges and how Glee gosh darn it is a major part of that. You just know shes going to win the prom queen tiara because seeing as how they gave it to Kurt on the TV show its clear the unconventional choice always wins out in Gleeville. Great messages of course. But Glee 3D is not good enough its not smart enough and doggone it well you get the gist. Perhaps Glee 3D would be easier to take if the spoken interludes didnt feel so random. Fans speak of how they worship gay character Kurt (Chris Colfer) but instead of leading into Colfers moment on stage its Mercedes (Amber Riley) over emoting Aint No Way. Colfer has his time however. The major student characters recreate their TV set pieces. (Aside from Gwyneth Paltrows one tune none of Glees adults appear in the film. Forget you Sue Sylvester.) Colfer and Lea Michele (Rachel) once again play out the 1963 Judy Garland-Barbra Streisand Happy Days Are Here Again/Get Happy shtick. Kevin McHale (Artie) has his Safety Dance number and Mark Salling (Puck) ogles the ""heap big woman"" in Fat Bottomed Girls. But stripped of the often brilliant choreography on the TV show that elevates the Kidz Bop arrangements of familiar tunes like Safety Dance Glee 3D is inert. The 3D filming puts viewers on stage with the performers a plus in a concert film but the quick cuts and camera angles which are placed mostly at waist level as the stars run around the stage in lieu of creative dancing lend every performance a flat same-y Idols Live feel. Only Lea Michele and Colfer truly have the vocal range to stand out among their cardboard castmates but even they lack the charisma and stage presence to ensure a post-Glee career. Michele isnt done any favors by the constant references to super nova talent Barbra Streisand -- who we are told is in the audience to hear her heir apparent belt one of her signature tunes Dont Rain on My Parade. ""I knew shed come"" a self-conscious Michele gloats but shes not convincing -- and neither is the movie because we never catch so much as a glimpse of our favorite Funny Girl slumming at a Glee concert.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Director Kevin Tancharoen (Fame) takes a few odd tacks with this concert film of the Glee live-performance tour. Even during the scant behind-the-scenes footage the Glee cast remains in character referring to each other solely by their names from their hit TV show and dropping awkward role-appropriate one-liners even though theres no frame story or premise to explain why those characters would be in concert or a documentary and even though the performers perspective would be far more intimate and relatable. Far odder The sound and visuals often dont sync. In particular either the background singers are sometimes cut out of the mix in favor of pre-recorded music or the visuals and audio were taken from different sessions. The staging of this show--shot at New Jerseys Izod Center in June 2011--is also sometimes strange with performers doing victory laps through the audience while aggressively surrounded by security or standing fixed on island mini-stages in the middle of the crowd. But none of this will matter a whit to the hardcore fans for whom Glee The 3D Concert Movie was designed as a celebratory self-validating experience. Tancharoen alternates full-song performances with short interviews of deliriously happy fans in homemade in-jokey Glee-wear. He also delves into the lives of three young Gleeks in particular--a forcibly outed gay teen a formerly friendless girl with Aspergers syndrome and a little-person cheerleader--each explaining how loving Glee taught them to embrace their differences and find acceptance among like-minded souls. Between the song choices (focusing almost exclusively on rousing numbers highlighted on the show from ""Sing"" to ""Im A Slave 4 U"" to ""River Deep Mountain High"" to ""Born This Way"") the fireworks-and-confetti-heavy production design and the upbeat interviews Glee The 3D Concert Movie sometimes feels like an Up With People session with one central message Glee isnt just a TV show its a pervasively positive community experience that improves everyone around it. One amusing disadvantage of the crystal-clear you-are-there 3-D cinematography and the focus on the audience experience is that in practically every shot its easy to pick out off-message concertgoers who are bored tired or otherwise disengaged. But mostly the screen is full of howling bouncing fans of a wide variety of ages showing their boundless love for their faux-teen idols. (Apart from Gwyneth Paltrow who turns up to perform Cee-Los ""Forget You"" the shows adult cast doesnt appear here.) In a handful of group numbers and a series of solo or duet outings the Glee kids bring huge energy and big Disney grins to their performances and the ones who can dance throw in a lot of extra bounce-and-twirl to compensate for those whose choreography just consists of endless running back and forth across the stage. Its a high-gloss high-impact extra-shiny production that fits the Glee dynamic to a T While the shows characters perpetually angst over the haters the show itself ignores them keeps grinning and counting the revenue streams and sings out for everyone whos drunk the Kool-Aid. There are worse philosophies. Share Tweet Filed Under Film Glee More Movie Review Previous Movie Review Senna Next Movie Review Final Destination 5 Dont miss a story--follow The A.V.

Glee the 3D Concert Movie Fair Director Kevin Tancharoen. Starring Cory Monteith Dianna Agron and Lea Michele. Rating PG for thematic elements brief language and some sensuality. This weeks new movie releases ""Glee the 3D Concert Movie"" however goes out of its way to put a barrier between the viewer and the actual performance. Thats the trouble with a 3D concert film. The effects are distracting. Glee in Phoenix The tour behind The 3D Concert Movie Glee The 3D Concert Movie not just about music Dancers and audience members suddenly pop out of the action in the foreground for no reason other than to remind you its 3D - technology that often makes the performance seem a little fuzzy. The effect lends the movie a video-game look. And theres one point where Lea Michele is just tearing it up on the ""Funny Girl"" song ""Dont Rain on My Parade"" when the camera zooms in for a close-up so freakish it feels as if shes about to eat the first 10 rows. Its sad because there are several strong performances from Michele with her ""Funny Girl"" song to Amber Rileys soulful cover of Aretha Franklins ""Aint No Way."" Gwyneth Paltrow drops by looking great to revisit her cover of Cee Lo Greens ""(Expletive) You"" without the expletives. And the dancing is great from Heather Morris doing her best Britney Spears on ""Im A Slave 4 U"" to the choreography straight out of ""Grease"" on the Amy Winehouse version of the Zutons ""Valerie."" The backstage footage of the cast is an added value whether its the playful interaction that makes it seem like they actually do go to high school together or Morris talking up her breasts. ""They are in 3-D"" Morris says. ""And they look really good."" We get to meet some Gleeks as well. Theres a cheerleading dwarf named Janae whos crowned prom princess at her high school after telling us that ""Glee has definitely changed the way I look at certain groups of people."" Theres a Jersey boy named Trenton who was outed in the eighth grade when a classmate found his journal full of schoolboy fantasies about another boy in class. And theres a weepy young woman with Asperger Syndrome whose hero is Morris character Brittany. What you dont see here are captains of the football team or cheerleaders that arent dwarves only the Gleeks whose ""American Idol""-style back stories stay on message positioning ""Glee"" as the voice of the modern (teen) outsider making them feel OK about not fitting in. As they say at the end of the film after finishing with ""Loser Like Me"" - ""It gives a story to everyone who doesnt have a voice."" Its entertaining at face value but they never let it be just that. Reach the reporter at ed.masleyarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4495.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday Aug. 10 2011 746AM EDT Last updated Thursday Aug. 11 2011 1239PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Country USA Language English There is something a bit makeshift about Glee The 3D Concert Movie a film designed for a two-week run that was put together in just six weeks after being shot in East Rutherford N.J. last June. The awkwardness is part of the movies charm. One critic complained that the concert tour felt like ""a glorified high-school talent show."" Its a good description of the film which is really about a chance to watch familiar friends - the very talented and the ordinary - get up onstage and perform. Here the cast members of the television show pretend to be their fictional characters even in backstage interviews that are conducted off-camera by the shows producer and major creative force Ryan Murphy. For all its artifice the concerts theme is also painfully sincere. On the contrary without the sarcastic undercutting of of Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) Glee is almost evangelical in its message of social inclusiveness. Throughout the film we cut away to outside the arena where various young fans express their love for their favourite Glee characters and share how the show has changed their lives. The film focuses on three fans stories a cheerleader who is a little person and is crowned her schools prom queen; a young gay man recalling his humiliating outing and a young woman diagnosed with Aspergers. They all explain why the show is important to them. At the centre of it of course is the healing unguent of music - chart-toppers pop classics and show tunes - that span generations of musical change and a spectrum of genres put through the Glee musical processor into catchy easy-on-the-ears arrangements. As much processing and auto-tuning as the TV show employs the best singers prove on stage that theyre the real deal. Chris Colfer who plays gay teen Kurt Hummel is the most sociologically interesting character on the show. Though his comedic chops dont get much chance to shine in the concert he sings like a high-spirited bird. His one solo number is The Beatless I Wanna Hold Your Hand (he copies the slow T.V .Carpio version from Across the Universe) and he shares some effortless octave jumping with Lea Michele on Get Happy/Happy Days Are Here Again a duet made famous by Barbar Streisand and Judy Garland. Michele on her own also knocks out a Broadway-sized version of Dont Rain on My Parade on My Parade Streisands hit from Funny Girl and turns Katy Perrys pop hit Firework into a power ballad. The other big voice on Glee belongs to Amber Riley (Mercedes on the show) whose rendition of Aretha Franklins 1968 hit Aint No Way does justice to the Queen of Soul. She also does a foot-stomping duet with Naya Rivera on Ike and Tina Turners River Deep Mountain High and generally is the core voice on the big ensemble numbers. For fans who wanted to exercise their own lungs the opportunity came during the three songs by Darren Criss who was introduced in the shows second season as Blaine Kurts love interest and the soloist with the rival show choir The Warblers. Criss and his choreographed and harmonizing Warblers (all clad in private-school uniforms) began with his breakthrough song a stripped-down version Katy Perrys Teenage Dream followed by Paul McCartneys Silly Love Songs and Pinks Raise Your Glass. Crisss intensity and strutting physicality feels both wholesome and sexual which is the key to Glees success as much as its social tolerance message. Some other song choices ( Jessies Girl Safety Dance) fall in the ""why bother?"" category though when tunes sound stale its always refreshing to look to dancer Heather Morris (aka Glees Brittany) her long limbs popping out and back as though they were on springs. (Regrettably the 3-D is used to little effect here beyond permitting a ticket markup.) The big ensemble finale on Queens secular hymn Somebody To Love with Michele and Riley providing the vocal pillars is big corny and generous. A high-school talent show no doubt but at its best one well worth glorifying.
