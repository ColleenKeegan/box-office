Comments South Park Bigger Longer amp; Uncut Recommended Rated R  80 minutes Four little boys looking for excitement in the form of new expletives sneak into a movie theater to see a controversial Canadian musical glorifying scatology and profanity. Their enjoyment winds up setting off World War III allowing this inspired self-referential animated musical (1999) set in Colorado and hell to suggest that the U.S. might evolve as a nation if even a fraction of the energy we spend trying to suppress irreverence went to examining bigotry and hypocrisy. Even more striking than the mockery of whipping boys right alongside sacred cows is the celebration of farting and saying fuck which makes it seem overwhelmingly obvious that people who worry about the effects of such stuff on children are idiots. Written by Matt Stone and director Trey Parker (creators of the South Park TV series) and Pam Brady; with the voices of Parker Stone Mary Kay Bergman and Isaac Hayes.

Written and directed by Trey Parker. (R. 88 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""South Park Bigger Longer amp; Uncut"" is an 88-minute wallow in nonstop crudeness vulgarity and unpleasantness. Its without any redeeming social value whatsoever. And its funny from beginning to end. The movie which opens today is an animated feature version of the Comedy Central series. Its story actually anticipates a thousand miniature dramas that will be played at theaters wherever ""South Park"" is shown. It starts with a group of kids who are horrified to find themselves barred from seeing an R-rated film. Yet with a little ingenuity and sneaking and lying they get in. At its most clever ""South Park"" is an argument against the very thing it is an R-rated comedy with a direct appeal for youngsters. The children in ""South Park"" see the movie-within-the-movie and come out transformed into foul-mouthed little monsters. The picture written and directed by Trey Parker who created the television series is a satire on contemporary America. The movie the kids long to see consists of nothing more than flatulence jokes and profane songs. But the songs are incredibly profane and thats what makes ""South Park"" more hilarious spoof than wallow. The world it depicts is only slightly more crude than our own. Parkers comic imagination is unrestrained and irreverent. The film takes several journeys into the depths of hell for example where Satan is having a gay relationship with Saddam Hussein (who in the world of the film is dead). Other inmates in hell there without explanation are George Burns and Mahatma Gandhi. Who knew? There are living targets as well. The films two biggest laughs are at the expense of the Baldwin brothers and Bill Gates respectively. The movie which is full of elaborate musical numbers expertly done in a grand Broadway style tells the story of a U.S. war with Canada. The idea is that Canada has been flooding the United States with immoral entertainment and in retaliation the United States starts an air war. In a send-up that Noam Chomsky would appreciate ""South Park"" shows the United States going to war in the manner of a totalitarian country -- using the machinery of the entertainment industry to whip up pro-war sentiment. Theres a scene thats as brilliant as it is grotesque in which a starlet performs a vulgar act at a USO show before a cheering crowd of soldiers. Shes just the warm-up act for a double execution of Canadian war criminals. As clever as it is the animation in ""South Park"" is terrible. Fans of the show are probably used to it but for anyone else the temptation to close ones eyes and just listen to the dialogue becomes irresistible at times. ""South Park"" is also disappointing near the end when it turns pious and tries to wrap up with a plea against censorship and intolerance. If anything the movie only amplifies the case that there are certain things kids shouldnt be allowed to see.

Every bit as tasteless irreverent silly and smart as the Comedy Central cartoon that catapulted creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone into the Hollywood catbird seat ""South Park"" has a gag-to-laugh ratio even higher than the new ""Austin Powers.""And its filled with roof-raising musical numbers. That may be the biggest difference from the half-hour show. Otherwise all the familiar strangely fatherless little devils are on hand lovelorn Stan still pining and puking for Wendy; obtuse Cartman making anti-Semitic cracks at the neurotic Kyle and the parka-shrouded incomprehensible Kenny who dies this time when a surgeon replaces his heart with a baked potato. How did he end up in surgery in the first place? He went up in flames in a failed attempt to light a fart.Oh yes flatulence is central to ""South Parks"" adolescent appeal but also to the movies plot--and its sly politics. The trouble begins when the kids sneak into an obscenity-filled Canadian movie ""Asses of Fire"" starring the infamous Terrence and Phil. Soon they are mimicking the stars every dirty word and just as soon Kyles outraged mom is leading a campaign to protect the children of the nation. (""Blame Canada"" is one of Parker and Marc Shaimans rousing musical anthems.) A kind of crackpot Madeleine Albright she soon has Clintons ear. When the Canadians protesting the arrest and imminent execution of Terrence and Phil bomb the entire Baldwin family to oblivion the hellhounds of war are unleashed. Better dead bodies than dirty words the voices of morality decree as Parker and Stone gleefully hurl satirical poop at the MPAA and all who have tried to muzzle ""South Parks"" wicked tongue. This raunchy assault on authority coming in the midst of the nations increasingly surreal debate on the pernicious influence of the media couldnt be more timely.

Delivering on at least two-thirds of its title -- commercial considerations evidently led co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone to cave on their avowed NC-17 in favor of an R at the 11th hour -- ""South Park Bigger Longer amp; Uncut"" brings cable TVs most objectionable tykes to the silver screen with considerable aplomb. Speaking of objections pic may well incite a firestorm over its utterly juvenile and tasteless (if oft hilarious) content given all the current hand-wringing over influence of ""irresponsible"" mass media entertainment on impressionable minds. Commercially the big question is to what extent this Paramount-WB co-production will suffer from the seasons resultant crackdown on sub-adult admissions since the broadcast series fan base largely skews under 18. At the very least twentysomethings will make this a short-term smash at the wickets with heady prospects ahead for the less-closely-guarded homevid market. Controversy (as well as ratings) have quieted down since the ""South Park"" series commenced two years ago on Comedy Central but feature release is likely to pump that volume back up -- even as it reinvigorates what was already becoming a somewhat stale concept. After a delightful opening ""production number"" (the first of many) re-introducing ""redneck"" Colorado mountain burg South Park and its quaint if callous inhabitants pic immediately sets to needling the series public-standards foes. Pint-size third-grade protags Stan Kyle Cartman (the tantrum-prone fat kid) and Kenny (the fatal-accident-prone one whose dialogue is ever-muffled by a parka hood) are thrilled to discover their TV faves Canadian fartistes Terrence and Philip have a movie (""Asses of Fire"") at the local plex. Uh-oh Its NC-17. The boys finesse this obstacle however and emerge with a whole new graphic vocabulary to abet their already precocious ""potty mouths."" This doesnt go down well at school or at home however. Wondering where to focus outrage Kyles mom spearheads an anti-Canadian agitprop campaign that soon lands Terrence and Philip in U.S. prison for ""corruption of youth."" Violent Canuck reprisal follows with all thesping Baldwin brothers the first to be bombed. Soon both nations are on the brink of full-scale combat. Meanwhile Kenny of course has met yet another tragic end. Ejected from heaven he goes south where Satan and recent arrival Saddam Hussein are engaged in a complex unsatisfying domestic relationship that lacks mutual trust and communication. (Its part of ""South Parks"" charm that treacly ""positive messages"" always come in the crassest imaginable packages.) Kyle Stan and Cartman orchestrate La Resistance a childrens underground aimed at preventing North American war and possible biblical apocalypse. Their efforts culminate at a USO show where Terrence and Philip are to be executed. Nothing is sacred and no humor too lowbrow in the South Park universe. Relying on a Lenny Bruce-type tactic of defusing explosive issues by childishly reveling in their most crude expression the screenplay (by the creators and Pam Brady) ladles out parodic high doses of xenophobia knee-jerk patriotism racism homophobia and whatever else comes to mind. Theres no true malice at work here -- its all really in service of an earnest pro-tolerance theme however snarkily articulated. Still even the most ""whatever""-oriented viewer may well balk at one point or another with Parker and Stones fixation on jokey gay-sex refs in particular taken to rather incessant extremes. More conservative observers will find the bigscreen ""South Park"" indefensible from start to finish. To varying degrees numerous celebrities (from Brooke Shields to Bill Gates) the White House and inevitably the ratings board become grist for a ruthless but frequently inspired comic mill. With censorship as their special quite personal target here the creators assail an MPAA that condones ""horrific violence as long as there arent any naughty words""; and Cartman is implanted with a custom V-chip that electroshocks kiddies out of their foul-tongued habits. No doubt the most low-tech animated feature from a major studio in eons ""Bigger"" preserves the TV series ""handmade"" aesthetic (via backgrounds and characters that look like childrens paper cutouts) to delightful bigscreen effect adding tacky bits of digital imagery and live action. Headlong pacing keeps the screen filled with eye-blink sight gags. Biggest development -- beyond revelations that Kenny is a blond and at last gets to speak clearly -- is a wholesale expansion of the shows occasional ""musical"" interludes. Ranging from a global sing-along reprise of ""Kyles Mother Is a Bitch"" to Terrence amp; Philips ""rap video"" and a ""West Side Story"" parody these rude ditties (penned by Parker) are fully orchestrated and lavishly ""staged"" to hilarious impact. Editing is of the greased-lightning ilk; shows voice talents (albeit without much participation from Isaac Hayes beloved Chef) stick to their willfully amateurish guns. George Clooney Minnie Driver and Dave Foley make brief audio appearances. Its hard to dismiss arguments that ""South Park"" is hardly suitable fare for younger auds incapable of understanding its subtler offense-allaying ironies. But ""Bigger Longer amp; Uncut"" will make it harder still to dismiss or kill this cultural mini-phenom -- not least because the feature is a more clever diversion than anyone had any right to expect.

But omigod. South Park Bigger Longer amp; Uncut turns out to be the funniest most risk-taking most incisive movie of the summer never mind that the summer is young. And the promulgators of fancier culture might take a few lessons in courage from South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Anyhow who knew? Parker and Stones ongoing South Park on Comedy Central -- hilarious as it can be -- has been wildly uneven and Parkers dorky previous films Orgazmo and Cannibal The Musical didnt exactly shoot flames of glory. Yet the characters in Bigger Longer amp; Uncut move with may I say asses of fire -- to crib the name of the deliriously scatological movie small-town prepubescents Kyle Stan Kenny and Cartman sneak into. The boys emerge with a vocabulary so obscene it sends the mothers of South Park Colo. into a frenzy of blame laying. Finger-pointing leads to war. Cartman is forced to test an anti-obscenity V-chip implanted directly into his corpulent self. Kenny meanwhile goes to hell where Satan and Saddam Hussein are bedmates but thats another story and its not for kids. Bigger Longer amp; Uncut dive-bombs such up-to-the-minute targets as Bill Gates Jar Jar Binks and parental responsibilities in a post-Littleton society. The plot rollicks ahead with few dead spots. And the inspired musical numbers (by Parker and Marc Shaiman) brilliantly parody/ honor the conventions of Broadway show tunes and especially the Disney-formula ditties of Alan Menken. If I dock the movie half a grade its only because in spite of everything I still believe in the possibility of other liberating less poo-poo-driven comedies that dont star characters made of construction paper.
