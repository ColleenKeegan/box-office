"New Country for Old Men On Last Vegas The Counselor All Is Lost and Bad Grandpa << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com New Country for Old Men On Last Vegas The Counselor All Is Lost and Bad Grandpa Courtesy of CBS Films Brad Pitt November 1 2013 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Last Vegas directed by Jon Turteltaub Its easy to forget that nerds and teenagers arent the only moviegoers who want their fantasies indulged. I thought about that watching Morgan Freeman in Last Vegas. As Archie a twice-married Air Force retiree who recently suffered a stroke all Freeman does for his first two or three scenes is sit in an armchair watching television. Hes surrounded by bottles of pills. He looks comfortable. But when a life-long friend Billy (Michael Douglas) puts him on a three-way call with Sam (Kevin Kline) and tells them that hes getting married Archie springs into action. He gets to go to Wonderland. The plan is that theyll fetch their pal Paddy (Robert De Niro) and join Billy in Las Vegas for a bachelor weekend. Archie tells his worrywart son (Michael Ealy) hes going to a church retreat which is a nice irony. Morgan Freeman doesnt go to church. He is church. You go to him. And thats the real pleasure of watching Freeman in this amusing smart-enough comedy He finally has something fun to do. He has played so many totems of virtue cool wisdom and assistance that its almost shocking to hear him bust Douglass balls with such exasperation and goodwill. Veteran director Jon Turteltaub (While You Were Sleeping both National Treasure movies) turns in another commercial contraption here and this one hums along just as efficiently as his others. Hes a specialist in the sort of movies that are more easy than they are good -- easy to watch easy to skip. I saw Last Vegas while sitting next to a guy who seemed to grow more physically ill as the minutes passed. Its far from that bad. For one thing Dan Fogelmans script avoids a lot of what you dread with a movie like this -- that itll pull a fast one and turn Grumpy Old Men into Amour. But no one in Last Vegas dies. No one even grabs his chest in pain. Its a celebration of something the movies never celebrate anymore being old. Some of it is silly. Sam for instance is given a little blue pill and a condom by his wife (Joanna Gleason) and is instructed to rediscover the man she married. Some of the movie is weirdly complicated. Billy and Paddy wind up fighting over the same lounge singer played by an impossibly well-preserved Mary Steenburgen with a knowing ditzy slur. Paddy is mad at Billy for missing his wifes funeral and would seem to have the moral imperative with the singer over his soon-to-be-married friend. But Douglas has been given a golden tan alabaster teeth and hair Moses could part. He has the cosmetic imperative. If Freeman is church Douglas is chintz. Every once in a while the comedy ebbs and a mortal rue shows up. Douglas for instance gets a line or two about what it means to be on the far side of middle age and why old men chase younger people. (He doesnt mention surgical glamour enhancements but he doesnt have to.) It sounds like it hurts Douglas to say these words. But the cheer of this movie will make it a hit. Its silly not dumb. You want to see Morgan Freeman in a perfectly tailored scarlet suit dancing with women and drag queens. Its a spry alive side of him we rarely see and we should savor it. Who knows when hell get to Wonderland again? The Counselor directed by Ridley Scott These are boom times for geezers at the movies. The no. 1 film in the country stars Johnny Knoxville pretending to be a dirty old man and people appear to be interested in experiencing Robert Redford imperiled at sea. Meanwhile the no. 4 movie was written by an 80-year-old and directed by a man whos 75. But The Counselor has the heartless verve of filmmakers half their ages. Its filthy nasty sexy absurd appalling and exhilarating and it succeeds as a musky union of novelist Cormac McCarthys bleakness and Ridley Scotts sense of chic. It opens with sex between Michael Fassbender and Penelope Cruz. Hes a lawyer. Shes his girlfriend. Actually The Counselor opens with them talking about the sex shed like to have. He wants her to tell him what she wants. ""I want you to touch me"" she says bashfully ""down there."" You hear her say that and you say to yourself ""Thats all the old man has? Down there?"" Then she grows specific. Fassbender makes her wish his command. And as he went to town I tried to fasten a seat belt that wasnt there. Loosely what follows is the story of the lawyers punishment for being foolish enough to enter the drug business. Everyone calls him ""Counselor"" but he spends a lot of the film being counseled -- by an elegant Bruno Ganz an exhausted Javier Bardem a smooth Brad Pitt a raw-looking Rosie Perez and a calculating Ruben Blades. They all speak in that insinuating roughhouse poetry of McCarthys. Its a threat and a seduction at the same time. Most of these people are at one end of the drug trade or another. Perez is in prison. Bardem hides himself in nightlife development. His character Reiner provides the Counselor with a semblance of friendship. He fears the intensity of his attraction to his girlfriend (Cameron Diaz) and frets about the vast unknowableness of certain women. But no one here seems trustworthy and it doesnt take long for the Southwestern dirt beneath the Counselors loafers to turn to quicksand. You knew that would happen but the movie ripples out far enough to show a brewing storm that involves strange ruthless secondary characters whose strings are pulled by unseen puppeteers. The prevailing sense of preordained hopelessness death and doom are standard McCarthy. He and Scott are not afraid of the ridiculous the symbolic the telegraphed or the literal. The movie is shockingly hilariously all of these things. I can imagine McCarthy has seen the tastefulness of The Road and the geometrical precision of No Country for Old Men and wanted something lewder and messier for his writing. This is how for example a car windshield gets a hot wax from Diaz while Bardem watches amazed in the passenger seat. That scene makes Tawny Kitaen look like Jessica Tandy. Bardems amazement was mine. The menagerie on display is remarkable. Bardem wears loud prints and big tinted bug glasses and looks as if he survived a nuclear meltdown at the Versace plant. Pitt looks like he sells used Cadillacs in 1986. And then theres Diaz. She finally gets to bring her athletic bimbo powers to bear on a part good enough to show us a welcome hardness and wisdom. The plastic surgeons havent gotten to Diaz yet. Unlike some of the older women in Last Vegas that face of hers can still tell a story. So do her clothes. All the jungle prints and snake skins she wears all the jewels and accoutrements make her exactly what certain men fear in certain women a predator. (Never mind that shes also the loving owner of two fearsome cheetahs a blatancy that would be appalling in a different film.) But you dont watch her flirt and splay herself and fear youre in the hands of misogynists. Its the opposite. The characters here might fear this woman. McCarthy and Scott kneel before her. All Is Lost directed by J.C. Chandor At 77 Robert Redford is still blonde but its an ashen sort of yellow like straw thats been drying for decades in the sun. But the creases and lines in his face havent diminished his handsomeness. Hes still something to see which is a good thing since hes all there is to watch in All Is Lost. He plays a yachtsman who awakens with a start to the sound of a small crash and the sight of water streaming through a gash in his boat. It has hit a wayward shipping container. He spends the movie trying to survive using only his nautical instincts. There are no pirates or aliens. A shark steals his lunch but the foes here are simply weather and time. This is an uncommonly absorbing movie. The director is J.C. Chandor whose previous film the stock market drama Margin Call was notable for a handful of well-wrought speeches. Aside from an apologetic letter Redfords character writes there are about two words in the film ""help"" and ""fuuuuuuuck."" Like Alfonso Cuarons Gravity and Paul Greengrasss Captain Phillips theres a kind of movie magic in play here. Chandor works with equal parts manual rigor existential wonder and circumstantial dread (the score by Alex Ebert gently sounds notes of all three). Of course it doesnt work without Redford. You need a star who doesnt seem ridiculous still slipping into cable knits and other yachtwear in a moment of crisis. You need a star who in doing and saying little gets a lot done. You need a star whose presence compensates for a screenplays narrative economy. Redford goes about the business of keeping himself alive with serious stoicism. You realize youre watching a dying breed of American masculinity. There are no tears. Theres no sentimentality. Theres no Vegas no self-pity. In rooting for this man to endure you arent hoping for the survival of a single star. Youre praying for something greater to last for an entire mode of being in the movies to persist. When Redford and Douglas and Clint Eastwood go all wont be lost. But something great and crucial to the pleasures of the movies will be. Jackass Presents Bad Grandpa directed by Jeff Tremaine Theres a quiet depressing strain that runs through each of these films. Just because no one keels over in Last Vegas for instance doesnt mean you cant sense the defensiveness. Jackass Presents Bad Grandpa on the other hand is a joke on the concept of death. OK its a Jackass production so its a joke on everything. But even by those standards its tenuous as a movie. Johnny Knoxville builds an hour and a half around public pranks involving his old-man character Irving Zisman. The makeup used to transform him is state-of-the-art -- as a moviegoer youre always aware youre watching a young person pretend to be old but you also believe that people on the street have no idea whats going on. All they see is a rude vaguely handsome seventyish man. Freshly widowed Irving is saddled with an estranged grandson Billy (Jackson Nicoll) a spiky butterball who can curse on command. They drive from Ohio to St. Louis to Tennessee and finally Raleigh where the boy is to be left with a father he doesnt know. Along the way they seemingly spontaneously concoct scenarios to ensure the shock and embarrassment of strangers. Knoxville gets a prosthetic penis stuck in a vending machine and begs for help removing it. The little boy calls random men daddy and a busty woman a tramp. Caskets are knocked over walls stained with exploded excrement and wedding cakes flown into. The problem with the film which was shot in part with hidden cameras is that Irv and Billy flee the scene before any consequences can be suffered. The movie is operating in the spirit of Sacha Baron Cohens road farces but those movies were prepared to stick around for the post-prank awkwardness because that was often where the good comedy was. Knoxville? He just wants to do Jackass stunts. And director Jeff Tremaine doesnt have any visual amazements to show us like he did in the great Jackass 3D. Bad Grandpa looks proudly cruddy. But you can feel Tremaine Knoxville and their frequent Jackass co-conspirators trying to subvert narrative comedies. Their subversion is funny only when theres tension between the old man the kid and the people who dont know theyre being fooled. The most hilarious sequence involves dressing Billy as a girl and entering him in a child beauty pageant. The wrongs pile up and theres a clear object of satire. That feels new for the Jackass experience a target that isnt a crotch. Id like to see Irv try to strike again with braver gags. Id like to see him in Vegas. Id like to see him try to write The Counselor.

As consolation prizes go its a wooden spoon a great writers pompous idea of pulp fiction treated with stultifying seriousness by everyone else involved. McCarthys disregard for screenwriting convention is compellingly reckless. He gives us an unreadable hero no visible antagonist and a pervading sense of evil too extreme to qualify as tension. Michael Fassbenders nameless lead character is a sharp-suited lawyer who enters into a drug deal with louche client Reiner (Javier Bardem sporting a conker-shell coiffure that even his No Country for Old Men character would deem a bit iffy) to pay off the Ritz-sized rock hes just bought his naive fiancee (a wasted Penelope Cruz). Things go awry; they always do. McCarthy is less concerned with the mechanics of his story than the nihilistic psychology propelling these people - a commendable aim defeated by the dearth of actual characters and the superficial chrome plating of Scotts direction. At least Cameron Diaz gives it some welly as the gold-toothed femme fatale who may or may not hold all the cards. She uses her nether regions as a windshield squeegee in the films most YouTube-ready scene and keeps a poker-straight face while delivering dialogue like Truth has no temperature. The Counsellor is a film smart enough to craft that line but dim enough to think it means something.

FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 3 2013A random moviegoerFeaturedSome say the dialogues are what makes the film but I have to strongly disagree with that sentiment. I like dialogues in films I dont mind when characters talk a lot in a movie. Usually. With the Counselor it was the first time I honestly hoped the characters would shut up already. Really its the same all the time no matter who is talking - to that extent actually that if you closed your eyes and had a bad ear for voices youd often wonder which one of the generally bland characters was talking - or if it would be a new one borrowed for another one-off scene repeating what others have already said maybe with another more or less interesting story to go with it. Actions have consequences. If someone mightier than you wants to harm you theres nothing you can do about it. Its hopeless and humanity is evil. That seems to be the lesson the movie wants to teach us. I get it. Its not very ""deep"" in a non-drug induced hallucination way but ok if thats what they wanted to tell us... still what little impact that ""message"" could have had dies in the fires of endless repetition and the refusal of any of the characters to challenge that notion. It hardly qualifies as being challenging or even philosophical.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 21 2013critiqueFeaturedGood looking philosophical crime drama.

The only narrative or visual threads were contained in Cameron Diazs styling - her eyeliner tattoos and hair-colouring were nicely linked with her affinity to her pet leopards.

MEXICAN GARAGE. A welder in coveralls and goggles is cutting a line along the side of the tank of a Ford F650 septic-tank truck with an acetylene torch. The tank of the truck has been cut in two laterally and a hoist is lowering a fifty-five-gallon drum into the open top of the tank. The welder is standing in the tank waiting to unfasten the hooks and the cable. MEXICAN GARAGE. The welder is welding the top of the tank back in place. A SMALL MEXICAN port town on the Gulf of California. Several trucks are being unloaded and are driven along the dock toward a warehouse with a sign over the door that says ""Aduana."" One of the trucks is the septic-tank truck. It is waved aside and the driver hands a brown envelope down to the customs inspector who puts it inside the front of his coat and the truck drives out to the road. SOUTHWESTERN DESERT. The septic-tank truck is sitting in the chaparral. The driver opens the door and stands up holding on to the roof of the cab and the top of the open door. Another man watches through the windshield with a pair of binoculars. In the distance a line of stragglers crossing through the chaparral men and women carrying suitcases and laundry bags over their shoulders. The standing man takes a cigarette from his shirt pocket and lights it and blows the smoke gently. DESERT. THE SUN has just set. Bare purple mountains are dark against a darkening sky streaked with deep red. There is the high thin scream of a motorcycle in the far distance very slowly becoming louder. Then it streaks across the middle distance in a small part of a second really just a blink of lights and whines away. A SMALL GROCERY STORE. A young man dressed in a bright-green leather motorcycle outfit--jacket and tight pants and green boots and gloves--is waiting in line his helmet hanging over his arm. He is somewhat dark. Part Mexican. The woman in front of him has unloaded her groceries onto the conveyor belt and the clerk is adding them up. She turns and smiles at the man. He is holding a ten-pound bag of dog food. SOUTHWESTERN DESERT. The septic-tank truck and a pickup are parked in the chaparral. The two Mexican drivers are talking to two other men. They squat on the ground. One passes around a pack of cigarettes. Then he picks up a stick and draws a map in the dirt. A WAREHOUSE WITH floodlights. The metal door clanks upward and the green-leather motorcyclist comes whining through on a Kawasaki ZX-12R and brakes and does a doughnut on the concrete floor and stops and shuts off the bike and takes off his helmet. A Doberman runs to him and stands up and he hugs her and tousles her ears and steps off the bike. There is a black late-model Cadillac Escalade parked toward the rear of the warehouse. He crosses the room with the dog leaping about him to an island in the far corner that contains a kitchen and a bed a tin locker and a leather easy chair taking the bag of dog food with him. He fixes the dog a bowl of food and turns on the stereo and opens the refrigerator and takes out a frozen dinner and puts it in the microwave and opens a beer and sits watching the dog eat. He puts the beer on the table and stands up and takes off the leather jacket and unzips a pocket and takes out a clear plastic bag and pitches it onto the table. It is full of hundred-dollar bills. NIGHT. NORTHERN Mexico at the U.S. border. The septic-tank truck is lumbering over the desert driving with only the parking lights on. The truck crests a slight rise and grinds to a halt. In the distance are the lights of a city. YARD OF THE Pump Masters Septic Tank Pumping Company. Early morning. The trucks are pulling out one by one and the yard master is checking them off on his clipboard. When they are all gone there is one truck left in the yard. A LARGE MOTORCYCLE store in the city. A man enters and stands looking. He crosses to where a Kawasaki ZX-12R motorcycle is circling slowly on a motorized dais. The dais is marked off with a blue velvet rope and the man approaches and stands looking at the bike for a moment then unhooks the rope and lets it fall to the floor and mounts the dais and stands circling with it. A clerk talking to a customer nearby sees him. The clerk comes over to the dais. The man has taken a steel tape measure from his coat pocket and is measuring the height of the Kawasaki at the handlebars. BORDER CITY. EVENING. An outdoor cafe adjoining a parking lot. Metal chairs and tables. Traffic. A Mexican man is sitting at one of the tables with a cup of coffee before him and a newspaper. The young man in green pulls up on the Kawasaki ZX-12R. He takes off the gloves and the helmet and puts the gloves inside the helmet and steps off the bike and walks to where the man is sitting and kicks back a chair and sits down. THE MAN AT THE table rises and goes leaving the paper on the table. The kid sits at the table and opens the newspaper and reads. THE KID RAKES AN object from under the paper into his helmet and puts down the paper and stands and puts the helmet under his arm and crosses the plaza to his bike and puts his foot over the bike and starts it and pulls his gloves from the helmet and lays them on the tank in front of him and pulls on the helmet and fastens the strap and then pulls on the gloves and kicks back the stand and pulls away into the traffic. NIGHT. TWO-LANE blacktop road through the high desert. A car passes and the lights recede down the long straight and fade out. A man walks out from the scrub cedars that line the road and stands in the middle of the road and lights a cigarette. He is carrying a roll of thin braided wire over one shoulder. He continues across the road to the fence. A tall metal pipe is mounted to one of the fence posts and at the top--some twenty feet off the ground--is a floodlight. The man pushes the button on a small plastic sending unit and the light comes on flooding the road and the mans face. He turns it off and walks down the fence line a good hundred yards to the corner of the fence and here he drops the coil of wire to the ground and takes a flashlight from his back pocket and puts it in his teeth and takes a pair of leather gloves from his belt and puts them on. Then he loops the wire around the corner post and pulls the end of the wire through the loop and wraps it about six times around the wire itself and tucks the end several times inside the loop and then takes the wire in both hands and hauls it as tight as he can get it. Then he takes the coil of wire and crosses the road letting out the wire behind him. In the cedars on the far side a flatbed truck is parked with the bed of the truck facing the road. There is an iron pipe at the right rear of the truck bed mounted vertically in a pair of collars so that it can slide up and down and the man threads the wire through a hole in the pipe and pulls it taut and stops it from sliding back by clamping the wire with a pair of vise grips. Then he walks back out to the road and takes a tape measure from his belt and measures the height of the wire from the road surface. He goes back to the truck and lowers the iron pipe in its collars and clamps it in place again with a threaded lever that he turns by hand against the vertical rod. He goes out to the road and measures the wire again and comes back and wraps the end of the wire through a heavy three-inch iron ring and walks to the front of the truck where he pulls the wire taut and wraps it around itself to secure the ring at the end of the wire and then pulls the ring over a hook mounted in the side rail of the truck bed. He stands looking at it. He strums the wire with his fingers. It gives off a deep resonant note. He unhooks the ring and walks the wire to the rear of the truck until it lies slack on the ground and in the road. He lays the ring on the truck bed and goes around and takes a walkie-talkie from a work bag in the cab of the truck and stands in the open door of the truck listening. He checks his watch by the dome light in the cab. HE TURNS OFF the walkie-talkie and takes the cigarette from his mouth and grinds it into the dirt and shuts the door of the truck. He looks at his watch. Very thin in the distance we can hear the high-pitched scream of the Kawasaki bike flat out at eleven thousand r.p.m. SHOT OF THE green rider bent low over the bike at a hundred and ninety miles an hour. Suddenly the floodlight comes on and he raises up and turns his head to look at it. THE TRUCK. THE desert is suddenly lit to the north of the wire man and he takes the ring and carries it forward and pulls it over the hook. The wire hums. SHOT OF THE green rider with his face turned back to the floodlight which is now behind him. Suddenly his head zips away and in the helmet goes bouncing down the highway behind the bike. The bike continues on the motor slows and dies to silence and in the distance we see a long slither of sparks recede into the dark. THE TRUCK. THE man clips the wire at the ring with a pair of wire cutters and the wire zips away. He walks out to the road with the walkie-talkie. In the road he shines the light down the blacktop and then walks down the roadside ditch until he comes to the helmet. ""How come you never want to spend time with my friends during our conjugal visits?"" Share Tweet Buy a cartoon HE PUTS AWAY the walkie-talkie and bends over and picks up the helmet. It is surprisingly heavy. He goes back to the truck and opens the cab door on the drivers side and puts the helmet on the floor and shuts the door and goes out to the road and crosses to the fence where he cuts the wire free from the fence post and begins to wind it up as he walks passing the wire over his elbow at each turn to make a coil. He stows the wire in a toolbox under the bed of the truck and gets in the truck and starts it and turns on the lights and drives out into the road. DESERT NIGHT. THE truck drives past the headless body sprawled in the road. Then it stops. The man looks out the window of the truck at the body then backs up the truck and gets out. He picks up the feet and drags the body into the ditch and wipes his hands on his pants and then gets back in the truck and pulls away down the highway. FRONT GATE OF the septic-tank company. The flatbed truck pulls up and the wire man gets out and shuts the door. He is holding a battery-driven die grinder in one hand and he watches the road behind him where a single light is approaching. Sound of a motorcycle. The cycle pulls up and the rider gets off and kicks down the stand and the wire man goes to the gate and turns on the die grinder and bends to cut the padlock on the gate. A sheaf of sparks lights up the area and the lock falls to the ground in about twenty seconds. He pushes open the gate and then bends and picks up the lock and juggles it in his hand and throws it into the bushes. THE SEPTIC-TANK truck on a two-lane blacktop road in central Texas. A late-model sedan is following it two men in the car. The passenger in the sedan plugs a flashing red roof light into the cigarette lighter in the dash and reaches out the window and places the light on the roof of the car. Then he takes a black box off the seat and holds it at the window and turns it on and it begins to emit a police-siren sound. The septic-tank truck slows and pulls over onto the verge and comes to a halt. The sedan pulls in some distance behind it and the two men get out putting on white Stetson hats. They are dressed in boots and tan slacks and white shirts and wear automatic sidearms. The driver of the truck--the wire man--watches them in the rearview mirror. The boots of the co-driver of the truck are moving back along the passenger side of the truck. The driver starts the truck and pulls away. The two men in the road have almost reached the truck and they draw their pistols and run forward. The co-driver of the truck is now lying in the bar ditch and when the truck clears his position the two men in the road are exposed directly in front of him and he opens fire on them with a pistol dropping one of them dead in the road and wounding the other in the leg. The wounded man dives into the ditch on the other side of the road. The truck has come to a stop again angled slightly toward the road and the driver opens fire on the wounded man with a pistol from the truck window. The wounded man presses himself flat in the ditch and takes careful aim with his pistol and shoots the driver in the head. The drivers pistol clatters into the road. The co-driver in the ditch sees the pistol fall. He studies the far side of the road and then backs down into the ditch and crouches and runs along the ditch toward the truck. The wounded man sees the mans back moving along the ditch and he stands and fires three rounds after him. The last round hits the tank of the truck and brown sewage starts to spout from the hole. The co-driver reaches the truck and opens the door and clambers in over the body slumped on the floor and crouching over the body he reaches and pushes the clutch to the floor with his hand and drops the shifter into first gear and reaches and releases the emergency brake. He pushes down the accelerator with one hand and lets the clutch out with the other and the truck moves forward into the road. The wounded man climbs out of the ditch and hobbles back to the car and gets in and shuts the door. He lays the pistol on the seat and reaches under the seat and takes out an AR-15 machine pistol with a twenty-round clip and pushes off the safety and starts the car and pulls out down the road after the truck. The truck has wandered to the far side of the road and the car pulls up along the passenger side of the truck and the wounded man opens fire with the AR-15 emptying the clip into the door of the truck. Then he backs away and pulls to the verge and sits watching. The truck veers slowly off the road in front of him and rolls down into the bar ditch where it tilts up onto two wheels and balances for a moment and then drops back onto all four wheels and sits there in silence. In the rearview mirror the man in the car can see another car approaching very small on the long stretch of blacktop road. He can see the pistol lying in the road and beyond that the dead body. The approaching car is shimmering in the heat waves off the road. The mans trouser leg is dark with blood to his boot. He places his hand on his thigh and leans forward slightly in pain. He turns the AR-15 on the seat and ejects the empty clip and reaches under the seat and gets hold of a small canvas bag and puts it in his lap and unzips it and takes out a loaded clip and loads the AR-15 and pushes back the slide with the heel of his hand. The approaching car has slowed. Now it stops. It turns sideways in the road and backs up and swings around and heads back the way it came. The wounded man has opened the door and he steps out and levels the AR-15 and opens fire on the fleeing car. He empties the clip and then lowers the gun and stands watching. The car slows and drifts off the road and down into the bar ditch and comes to a stop. The man reaches into the car and gets another clip and reloads the AR-15 and turns and goes down the bank to the truck. SEWAGE IS STILL leaking from the bullet hole in the tank. The man limps up to the passenger side of the truck with the gun at the ready and pulls open the door and steps back. Then he steps up and reaches into the truck and pulls out a body by the belt and lets it fall into the grass. Then he pulls the other one out on top of it. He turns and climbs up out of the ditch and stands in the road and looks up the road and down. He limps down the road to the car and gets the pistol and the pouch of clips off the seat and takes the keys out of the ignition and goes to the rear of the car and opens the trunk and gets out his bag. THE MAN IS sitting in the front seat of the septic-tank truck whittling with his knife on a tree branch. His open bag is sitting on the seat beside him. There is a box of 9-mm. cartridges in the open bag and he takes one of the cartridges out and compares the diameter of the bullet to the diameter of the stick he is whittling. Now he cuts a ring around the branch about three inches from the end. The man climbs down from the cab of the truck and walks back and jams the end of the stick into the hole in the truck. He breaks off the branch and throws it to one side and folds away his knife and wipes his hands on his trousers and taps the plug in more firmly with the pistol and then goes back and climbs painfully up into the cab and shuts the door and rests for a minute with his eyes closed. Then he takes out his cell phone and dials a number and puts the phone to his ear. PLYWOOD OFFICE of a junk yard in the desert. The junk-yard man is talking on the phone. A pit bull lying on a mat beside his desk growls and stands up. The man looks up. He hangs up the phone and looks at the client. The client comes forward in his bloodstained clothes and limps to a stop and reaches into his jacket. He takes a false-leather pouch with a bank logo from his coat and unzips it and takes out three banded sheaves of hundred-dollar bills and drops them onto the desk. The junk-yard man stands up. THE SEPTIC-TANK truck is being jacked up on one side with two floor jacks. The junk-yard man operates one of the jacks. The plug has been removed from the hole in the tank and sewage is leaking from the hole. The truck tilts up and the leak slows and then stops. JUNK YARD. THE owner is standing in a chair wearing welding goggles and holding an oxyacetylene torch. He melts lead from a stick and spreads it over the bullet hole in the tank with a wooden paddle. A MOBILE HOME at the edge of the junk yard. Interior. The wounded man is lying on a cheap sofa with his leg stretched out on a coffee table that is covered with a sheet. There is a plastic bucket on the floor filled with bloody gauze. A GARAGE THE septic-tank truck. There is a gantry crane overhead--a chain hoist that slides on iron rails--and a man in coveralls and welding glasses is slicing open the tank of the truck laterally from front to rear with a cutting torch. The top half of the tank is being lifted by two hooks and the chains from the single hook hanging from the pulley. Inside the severed tank lie four fifty-five-gallon steel drums. THE WASH BAY in the corner of the garage. The four drums are standing upright on pallets and the worker in coveralls and rubber boots is hosing them down with a steam washer. TWO MEN IN breathing masks at the wash bay. One is in work clothes and one is in white coveralls. The worker has an electric driver and is unfastening the tops of the drums. One of the drums is already open and the man in coveralls takes out four clear plastic bags each holding a kilo of cocaine. The worker unscrews the bolt on the second drum and lifts away the rim that circles the top of the drum and moves on to the next.

The Counselor is the cumbersome end product of a high-minded writer trying to slum and a slick director aiming for cosmic depth. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - In his first original screenplay written directly for the screen novelist Cormac McCarthy takes a holiday from the apocalyptic portentousness of his No Country for Old Men and The Road adaptations instead giving us a wet-lipped drug dealer (Javier Bardem) with hedgehog hair and a pastel-hued cactus-laden mansion; a pair of deadly cheetahs; and a constricting weapon that slowly severs heads.What hasnt been lost is McCarthys wordy speechifying which undoubtedly aroused director Ridley Scott. The look of The Counselor is smeary and smoggy as if shot during one long hot dirty Los Angeles morning. Yet amid Scotts chronic fetishizing of various macho odd jobs from alloying liquid metals to removing bullets are long-winded monologues about the inherent evil in all of us. Its a bit like attending Sunday school in a bordello.Film Details The Counselor RatingR GenreSuspense/Thriller Running Time111 More Info Aside from its enjoyably bleak ending The Counselor generates few thrills mainly because its pawn -- a corrupt lawyer undone by a botched Mexican drug deal -- is played by Michael Fassbender a steely intimidating figure who looks merely sulky when hes supposed to be in peril.Cameron Diaz as Bardems two-faced wife trips over her characters Barbadian accent and over impossible lines like ""its our faintness of heart that drives us to the edge of ruin."" But she still proves irresistible; her angular cheekbones and feline pout resemble Sophia Lorens and her spry gymnastic performance -- in one sequence she straddles a whole windshield -- is the brightest spot in this joylessly seedy enterprise.Follow VoiceFilmClubSubscribe to the Voice Film Club podcast1 Javier Bardem and Michael Fassbender in The Counselor.

"Counselor The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; counselor-the ) Counselor The (United States/United Kingdom 2013) October 25 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli When I first heard about The Counselor it became one of my most anticipated titles of 2013. The talent alone made it seem like a ""cant miss"" proposition Ridley Scott directing; Cormac McCarthy the man responsible for the source material of No Country for Old Men making his screenwriting debut; and an A-list cast headlined by Michael Fassbender Penelope Cruz and Brad Pitt on board. Then troubling signs began to materialize an underwhelming marketing campaign a lack of festival showings and few press screenings. Now that Ive seen it I can understand the studios ambivalence about promoting The Counselor. Its not so much a bad film as it is a disappointing one. A very disappointing one. Most of the problems can be traced to McCarthys script which doesnt work. Its as if he took many of the core elements of No Country for Old Men and minimized the ones that worked while emphasizing those that were frustrating and unsuccessful. The central story of The Counselor is unremarkable and the thrills it offers are often manufactured rather than organic. The films big car chase lacks suspense because theres only one practical outcome. Other moments of tension are similarly diluted. This is a tale in which characters are boxed in with no way out. We as viewers are simply watching to see how long it takes before the hammer falls. The Counselor ends abruptly making us wonder if director Ridley Scott lost the final few pages of the screenplay. Walking out of the theater I was assailed by a sense of ""Is that it?"" Despite the rather restricted nature of narrative content theres no shortage of verbiage. Most of the characters in The Counselor are afflicted with a bad case of verbal diarrhea. They talk and talk and talk. They philosophize. But little of what they say is interesting. Its pretentious to be sure but not thought-provoking. A three minute dissertation on diamonds is an early indication that pacing is going to be a problem. The most interesting discourse involves Javier Bardems Reiner recounting how his predatory girlfriend Malkina (Cameron Diaz) fucked his car. Were provided with some images to enhance our understanding of the situation which involves comparisons to a catfish. It ends with Reiner admitting that he wasnt that turned-on because the peep show was ""too gynecological."" Its not just that the dialogue is dense - a lot of French films succeed because the characters dont shut up - but many of these characters seem to exist for the sole purpose of giving long-winded monologues. McCarthy develops a thin narrative about a drug shipment gone awry and populates it with poorly developed individuals who like to talk. Its difficult (bordering on impossible) to sympathize with any of them. Not only are they all morally bankrupt but theyre boring. The lead character (Michael Fassbender) referred to only as ""Counselor"" (hes a defense attorney) is supposed to be a conflicted man trapped between the temptation to do evil and the love of a good woman (Penelope Cruz) but he comes across as slick and smarmy. He becomes involved in drug running because he needs money to pay for a 3.8 karat engagement ring and finance a lavish lifestyle. Predictably it all goes wrong with disastrous results. The most interesting character is Malkina because shes so unreservedly vicious - a true man-eater. This may be the most interesting portrayal Cameron Diaz has provided in a long time but its wasted. At least Michael Fassbender and Brad Pitt can pretend this film doesnt exist and concentrate on promoting 12 Years a Slave. Perhaps the central fault is that McCarthys style needs the filter of a strong adaptation. Its accepted that his novels are ""difficult reads"" and theres a sense that the content of The Counselor might work better as a book where themes can be extended and characters better developed. Ridley Scott appears to understand McCarthys tone - the film is replete with gruesomely witty moments that include decapitations and severed fingers. Still pacing is an issue and theres not much Scott can do with a screenplay that pauses every few minutes so a character can issue a lengthy speech full of false profundity. Ultimately the reason The Counselor doesnt work is the reason it was so highly anticipated the Cormac McCarthy screenplay. Good acting by recognizable stars and competent direction by an acclaimed filmmaker cant rescue this deeply flawed script.

Its as if Scott McCarthy and their all-star cast which also includes Brad Pitt and Javier Bardem could not stop themselves from making the worst movie in the history of the universe (or at any rate one of the worst Ive ever seen). Yet at the same time they felt honor-bound to poison the well subtly by turning the film into a self-referential commentary on its own terribleness. This is simultaneously an empty and meaningless mainstream atrocity and a work of brilliant cultural subversion (although Im not saying the latter was intentional or conscious).Employing a dreadful Texas accent he seems to have gleaned off early-90s TV back in Killarney Fassbender plays a sharp-dressed El Paso lawyer with few distinguishing characteristics and no name who gets involved in a murky and obviously doomed drug deal whose details are never explained. The fact that this dude is ubiquitously addressed as ""counselor"" appears to be a labored reference to the famous scene between Mickey Rourke and William Hurt in Lawrence Kasdans 1981 neo-noir ""Body Heat"" which is the kind of movie this one is trying and failing to become. Its like watching a walrus try to become a ballerina except that at least a walrus makes a good walrus. Anyway the drug deal goes bad -- just once in my life Id like to see a movie where the drug deal goes well -- and the Counselor suffers the torments of Job with about the same level of explication but less drama and worse writing. Way worse writing; in the pantheon of terrible writing by supposedly good writers McCarthys labored screenplay for ""The Counselor"" will forever hold an honored spot.There are a couple of decapitations in ""The Counselor"" possibly as many as three along with two shootouts one of them entirely non-germane to the so-called plot. Oh and theres a scene where a woman has sex with a car. Well get to that. But the narrative of the film is almost entirely discursive and largely consists of the Counselor sitting around with his obviously crooked associates --Pitt in a dingy white suit stringy hair and a black eye; Bardem in hilariously ugly designer duds accessorized with girly cocktails -- having stilted stylized conversations about women and money and snuff films and the meaning of life that dont go anywhere. Its like a mumblecore movie about a bunch of Sarah Lawrence philosophy majors made by coked-up rich people for 100 bajillion dollars.But what finally dawned on me is that for the first half of the film everybody repeatedly warns Fassbender that he shouldnt do what hes about to do -- that hes about to cross a fateful line and theres no going back etc. -- and in the second half everybody tells him that hes done it and its too late and now he has to accept a really awful new reality. In one of the last scenes when the Counselors debasement is almost complete he sits weeping in a car in Ciudad Juarez with a phone pressed to his ear listening to a lengthy monologue delivered by Ruben Blades playing some kind of Mexican drug lord. McCarthy really thinks hes writing up a storm here; the speech goes on and on signifying nothing beyond sorry dude youre screwed. Fassbender here as throughout the film stands in for the audience in his blankness his pigheadedness his lack of qualities. We were repeatedly told it was a bad idea to watch this movie but we went ahead and did it anyway and now it cant be undone. As Blades pseudo-Shakespearean soliloquy more or less puts it whose fault is that?Some film-world corollary to Murphys Law appears to be in operation here and if ""The Counselor"" is a sterling example its far from the only one. I think it works like this Anytime producers and executives feel certain theyve preassembled a great movie theyre wrong. I suppose some bigwig in Rupert Murdochs Fox empire signed a contract with Scott McCarthy and producer Nick Wechsler -- Im thinking a cocktail napkin from the Chateau Marmont or the Polo Lounge was involved -- and went back to the office believing hed bitten off a big juicy chaw of the devils candy.I dont know whether all the big-name stars were attached to ""The Counselor"" at that point but as the project moved along it seemed to glow with infernal luster. The director of ""Alien"" ""Blade Runner"" and ""Black Hawk Down"" plus the Pulitzer-winning author whose novels have already yielded one Oscar-winning near-classic film the Coen brothers neo-western ""No Country for Old Men."" (Now it could have been said even before all this that those two guys have a tendency toward bloat and self-indulgence which might interact poorly. But who could have known how bad it could get?) Throw in not one or two but three of the hottest male stars in the business each of whose wardrobes for this film could fund a dozen indies spinning a tangled Tex-Mex saga of drugs money sex and death. You Might Also Like What could possibly go wrong? Well nothing and everything. ""The Counselor"" is a uniquely and almost impossibly bad movie precisely because the talented and laurel-bedecked people behind it made exactly the movie they wanted to. Nobody gets to blame the budget for this one or inexperience or technical ineptitude. ""The Counselor"" is not corporate-crafted cynical crapola designed to deliver a quick payday after the fashion of most Hollywood movies which are bad because no one involved claimed authorship took responsibility or actually gave a damn. If you eat dinner at Burger King and the food sucks its disingenuous to get all mad about it. This is more like having Alice Waters and Mario Batali labor in the kitchen for a while and then serve you a gray-green burger on Wonder Bread with what looks like somebodys pubic hair stuck to it. But surrounded with whimsical garnishes of fresh herbs.From its early helicopter shots of Ciudad Juarez to its entirely gratuitous London street scenes (featuring decapitation) ""The Counselor"" oozes expensive production design grade-A cinematography literary pretension and philosophical pseudo-profundity. All those elements contribute to the gelatinous turd-like final product but the secret sauce is the movies certainty that it contains meaning or has something to say when its really more like the nihilistic erasure of meaning. Even counting the already infamous scene in which Cameron Diaz humps the windshield of a Ferrari while Javier Bardem stares at her genitals goggle-eyed and disbelieving from the passenger seat -- its like an outtake from a suppressed Jerry Lewis porn film -- this isnt a work of miscalculated camp excess after the fashion of ""Showgirls.""Diaz is kind of supposed to be playing an evil tattooed bisexual vamp but she doesnt get much screen time and feels painfully miscast. Anyway she has to sit around delivering McCarthys turgid and overcooked dialogue instead of doing anything to justify her outrageous outfits. Theres one scene between Diaz and Cruz playing Fassbenders ladylike and almost virginal fiancee that delivers a faint flicker of trashy allure. But despite its location photography and lustrous design aesthetic ""The Counselor"" has a puritanical devotion to boring and frustrating the audience that rivals the mid-90s video work of Jean-Luc Godard. Instead of having sex or even talking about sex -- the dynamics of the scene might call for Diaz to tell Cruz exactly what shed like to do to her but not do it -- the two women talk around the idea of talking about sex. (Theres a later scene in which Diazs character tries to confess her abundant sins to a priest and he wont listen.) I suppose its dimly possible that Scott and McCarthy have deliberately crafted a movie that looks like a mainstream entertainment but is in fact some work of deliberately unsatisfying postmodern gamesmanship. But its not likely. In the movie business that phrase I used earlier -- the devils candy -- connotes the magical combination of artistic legitimacy cultural currency and commercial success. Everybody in Hollywood chases it and as in Julie Salamons terrific book of that title about a big-budget failure of another era (Brian De Palmas film version of ""Bonfire of the Vanities"") almost nobody gets hold of it. Whats implicit in the term of course is the idea that the devils candy isnt worth getting in the first place that its a trick designed to lure the unwary into the pits of hell.Cinema history is full of devils-candy productions that became seen as flops or disasters from D.W. Griffiths ""Intolerance"" to Joseph L. Mankiewiczs ""Cleopatra"" to ""Heavens Gate"" and ""Ishtar"" and ""John Carter."" Well those movies are masterpieces each and every one compared to ""The Counselor."" Id watch them all straight through back to back and several times over if I didnt ever have to see this again. If its not objectively the worst film ever made -- because thats an impossible standard -- it might be the worst of all devils-candy films the worst ever made by people this talented. And we were warned Early on in answer to Fassbenders expressed desire for money or experience or whatever Brad Pitts skeezeball character offers this splendid retort ""Ive seen it all Counselor.

By Forrest Wickman Cameron Diaz and Javier Bardem in The Counselor. Photo by Kerry Brown/Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation Long before the first heads have popped off in director Ridley Scott and writer Cormac McCarthys leering new thriller The Counselor a club owner named Reiner (Javier Bardem) sits down with his unnamed lawyer (Michael Fassbender) to offer him some advice. If the lawyer goes ahead with his scheme to enter the Mexican drug trade Reiner warns he will soon be entangled in a bloody world of betrayals and yes beheadings. Reiner doubts his attorney unversed in the ways of the criminal underworld is prepared for the horrors. To illustrate his point Reiner describes a device called the bolito a sort of portable mechanical noose. Once the attacker sneaks up from behind and loops it over the victims head the bolito cannot be deactivated--it will not stop until it cuts into your carotid arteries spraying anyone in the vicinity. Forrest Wickman Forrest Wickman is a Slate senior editor. He writes and edits for Slates culture blog Brow Beat. One of the ironies of The Counselor is that its always the so-called counselor whos receiving advice like this not the one doling it out. (Lest you miss the point hes always addressed as ""counselor."" In the credits he is listed only as ""The Counselor."") If heavy-handedness--or headlessness--isnt your cup of tea Ive got a bit of advice for you Stay away from this movie counselor. Eventually the actors cease to sound like distinct characters. They all just sound like Cormac McCarthy. As for Fassbenders character hes not one to heed such sensible warnings for reasons that arent entirely clear. The plot is unusually hazy for a major Hollywood production but this much we know The counselor wants to win the hand of his new girlfriend Laura (Penelope Cruz charming in an underdeveloped role) with things like 3.5-carat diamonds. In fact its women whether theyre Madonnas or whores who draw all the men in this movie toward danger. Soon we meet a middleman called Westray (a fidgety Brad Pitt who as usual excels in a supporting role). Hes more cautious and more experienced than the counselor but also confesses his weakness for femmes fatales. Reiner has Malkina (Cameron Diaz) a mysterious woman whose insatiable sexual appetites are matched only by her taste for cheetah-related apparel In addition to her pet cheetahs which she takes sunbathing and for rides in the car she has multiple cheetah dresses and--for when shes slipped out of her cat suit--cheetah spots tattooed on her back. Advertisement It would seem impossible to overplay a character already so over-the-top but Diaz all but claws at the camera. She also gets the best scene in the movie in which Malkina crawls onto the hood of Reiners yellow convertible Ferrari and uses the windshield to masturbate. (If the mechanics of this are unclear to you the movie--which seems obsessed with the mechanics of all things unseemly--explains in detail how this bit of auto-erotica works.) Its the one moment when the movie fully embraces its own ridiculousness. The rest of the time The Counselor takes itself far too seriously. For long stretches were subjected to what feels like an endless parade of movie stars philosophizing about death--its ineluctability its finality how ""the extinction of all reality is a concept no resignation can encompass."" This might be fascinating--the 80-year-old McCarthy has written evocatively about mortality both in the post-apocalyptic The Road and in imagining the Death-like specter Anton Chigurh in No Country for Old Men. But novelists dont always make good screenwriters--this is the first film for which McCarthy has written the screenplay himself--and The Counselors nihilism soon becomes tedious. This is a movie in which various characters say things like ""Death doesnt care. Death has no meaning"" or the Yoda-esque ""There is no choosing only accepting."" A drug kingpin (Ruben Blades) offers a dissertation on the Spanish poet Antonio Machado. Eventually the actors cease to sound like distinct characters. They all just sound like Cormac McCarthy. This musing on death is far from the only thing The Counselor has in common with No Country for Old Men. Both movies feature outsiders scrambling for drug money along the Texas-Mexico border and both feature Javier Bardem sporting a funny haircut. (For The Counselor Bardem modeled his hairstyle after producer Brian Grazers.) But while the Coen brothers No Country seemed to sympathize with the townsfolk no matter how naive Scotts camera seems to admire the pure unclouded hostility of natures hunters. In No Country for Old Men the final word goes to Tommy Lee Jones. His character at least dreams of a nicer world. Here the last word goes to cheetah enthusiast Cameron Diaz. Its enough to make the extinction of this movies reality a welcome concept indeed. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post There are two money shots in the misbegotten cautionary tale ""The Counselor."" One is of a sexual nature -- naturally -- the other of stealthy violence. Each in its way underscores the nasty amorality not just of the world that the films title character (Michael Fassbender) enters greedily but of the movie itself. Directed by Ridley Scott ""The Counselor"" touts one of the seasons most enviable ensembles Javier Bardem and Brad Pitt portray the Counselors business associates Reiner and Westray. Penelope Cruz is Laura the Counselors beloved. And Cameron Diaz plays Reiners tech-savvy squeeze Malkina who owns a pair of cheetahs. Tacky we know. Some of the movies buzz comes from the fact that this is novelist Cormac McCarthys maiden screenplay. A number of the acclaimed writers books have been adapted for the big screen ""All the Pretty Horses"" ""The Road"" and most successfully Joel and Ethan Coens Oscar-winning ""No Country for Old Men."" The writer is hardly a stranger to the evil that men do the greed that overtakes them. The Counselor is participating in a version of drug-cartel Powerball -- a ""one-time deal"" -- and then hes out. Uh-huh. Much of the intrigue unfolds in the region that includes Mexicos Ciudad Juarez and El Paso. In a movie about irrevocable choices Diazs casting is a spectacular blunder. A lissome amiable better-than-capable comedic actress Diaz is called on to be a brilliant femme who may or may not be fatal. Its a pivotal role; her turn is wince-worthy. Still ""The Counselor"" will be quoted word for word. McCarthy has stirred some pungent philosophical musings into this rank stew. Ruben Blades shows up late as a drug-cartel honcho who shares his theories on the timing of moral decisions and their consequences. And the movies expertly choreographed death dances are sure to be recounted with film-geek relish. There are hints that the film wants to resonate more thoughtfully with harrowing reality. In a late scene the Counselor comes upon a rally demanding an answer to the murders and disappearances of people (predominantly women) in Ciudad Juarez. But movies can be like undercover cops They become too enamored of the worlds they explore. More than the evil that men engage in ""The Counselor"" wants to say something about men and women. The movies raison detre might well be the story Reiner tells the Counselor about a woman having intimate relations with a Ferrari. ""It was too gynecological to be sexy"" he says. Indeed.

"Review The Counselor a disappointment - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview The Counselor a disappointmentBy Randy MyersSan Jose Mercury News CorrespondentPosted 10/24/2013 021401 PM PDTUpdated 10/24/2013 101650 PM PDT In his tragedies from ""Titus Andronicus"" to ""Macbeth"" William Shakespeare subjected his ill-fated characters to all sorts of horrible depravity. Sons baked in pies. Duplicitous daughters. Murder-plotting wives. So its no shocker that ""The Counselor"" -- a thinking persons thriller by novelist Cormac McCarthy who has been hailed as a Shakespeare of the American West -- is awash in blood foreshadowing manipulative characters and shattering consequences.But what is surprising is how this glossy and depressing production with its top-shelf cast -- Michael Fassbender Javier Bardem Penelope Cruz Brad Pitt and Cameron Diaz -- winds up as fatally flawed as one of the Bards lead characters.With all that talent expectations are high especially after the Coen brothers did such a stellar job of adapting McCarthys ""No Country for Old Men"" for the screen. Whats delivered though is an overstated overbearing bummer. Thankfully this downer isnt opening over the holidays.Thats not to say there arent a number of individual elements that make it stand out -- dialogue that begs to be remembered and quoted another Oscar-worthy turn from Bardem with his high-voltage hair and flashy clothing and director Ridley Scotts beautifully orchestrated scenes of graphic carnage.Advertisement But the plot about a hotshot lawyer -- called only the Counselor (Fassbender) -- whose partnership with nightclub owner Reiner (Bardem) circuitously leads him and his sexy love interest Laura (Cruz) into the take-no-prisoners world of drug cartels is viciously bleak. Whats worse its downright obvious.While Shakespeare understood the importance of nuance in foreshadowing McCarthys screenplay all but screams it at us. When one character yammers about unfathomable acts of violence we suspect that said acts will happen. They do. Scott (""Gladiator"" ""Prometheus"") cagily plays on that sense of dread with the moody visual help of director of photography Dariusz Wolski. But they cant overcome the fact that the action is all but blatantly telegraphed even as McCarthy keeps shuttling his characters around from Amsterdam to Mexico.Neither can Diaz who lands the juicy role of Malkina a morally corrupt predator with an insatiable appetite for money. She sinks her talons into Reiner -- who lusts after and wisely fears her -- then slinks around seeking fresh prey. In early scenes Diaz with her two-toned hair and showy wardrobe has a heyday with the femme fatale part especially when she hangs out with Laura and the contrasts between the two become glaringly apparent. Diazs portrayal is undermined by a silly bit when Malkina confesses her sins to a priest (Edgar Ramirez utterly wasted). Its an embarrassing attempt at levity that should have wound up on the cutting room floor. In its place you wish McCarthy would have expanded more on the roles of supporting characters -- from Rosie Perezs incarcerated mother who is a client of the Counselor to Brad Pitts more substantial part as the Counselors contact person.This movie just isnt all that interested in them. Its too preoccupied with creating a dismal and tortured view of what the world can become when we make bad decisions. The result is an exhaustingly downbeat experience.So just when is the next showing of ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2""?The counselor   Rating R (for graphic violence some grisly images strong sexual content and language)Cast Michael Fassbender Javier Bardem Cameron Diaz Penelope CruzDirector Ridley ScottRunning time 1 hour 51 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Curb Your Enthusiasm The long wait for new episodes is almost overGame of Thrones Season 8 definitely the lastReview Holocaust haunts family in The Gathering Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

The Counselor Credit Kerry Brown/20th Century Fox By Peter Travers October 24 2013 More News Peter Travers Fall Movie Preview All Stories >> When an indisputably great author like Cormac McCarthy (Blood Meridian The Road) writes his first original screenplay attention must be paid. When that screenplay turns out to be as clunky as The Counselor ""forgive and forget"" are the words that come to mind. Pulitzer Prize winner McCarthy 80 has earned his place in the writing pantheon. The Coen brothers shaped his No Country for Old Men into a Best Picture Oscar winner in 2007 by meshing McCarthys words and their vision with spare thrilling exactitude. More News Peter Travers Fall Movie Preview All Stories >> No such discipline exists in The Counselor a droning meditation on capitalism in the form of a thriller about cocaine trading on the Tex-Mex border. Director Ridley Scott gets in some fierce action in the films final third. But the emphasis on talk leaves the words no room to breathe much less resonate. McCarthys name has attracted a starry cast of chatterboxes. Michael Fassbender plays the title role; no one calls him anything but ""Counselor."" He naively signs on to expedite the importing of cocaine from Colombia to Chicago in a septic-tank truck. His reason for breaking bad? The girl of his dreams (Penelope Cruz). In the opening scene they talk dirty to each other. ""You have the most luscious pussy in all of Christendom"" he says. ""Oh God"" she says. A religious allegory? Lets hope so. As eroticism its um unconvincing. The Counselor is soon in over his head. Westray a middleman played by a bemused Brad Pitt sets him straight ""You think you can live in this world and not be a part of it?"" Guess not. When the deal goes bad a panicked Counselor turns to the fixer Reiner (Javier Bardem) to save him from cartel vengeance. But Reiner has his own problems. He and his lady Malkina (Cameron Diaz) enjoy letting two cheetahs run wild in the desert to (symbol alert) hunt prey. Reiner recounts a long descriptive story about how Malkina once fucked his Ferrari. Then the film shows her doing it. ""It was too gynecological to be sexy"" says Reiner. I agree. The rest of the movie piles on beatings killings and grisly decapitations punctuated by conversations about morality. Oddly the published screenplay - while far from McCarthys top-drawer - reads better than it plays. Whats onscreen recalls a line from No Country ""Its a mess aint it Sheriff?""

Because when you really look at them the stories of his that have reached the screen are just tricked-up genre tales wrapped in fake profundity and decorated with ribbons of ponderous philosophizing dialogue. Yes ""No Country for Old Men"" was terrific -- although much of that was due to the setting the Coens stripped-down staging and fine performances (including that of Javier Bardems outrageous wig). But ""All the Pretty Horses"" was a slumbering Western and ""The Road"" just one more post-apocalyptic here-come-the-cannibals movie. And if you saw HBOs version of his two-hander ""The Sunset Limited"" -- well my sympathies. Unfair you say. McCarthy only wrote the books; judge them not the Hollywood adaptations. Except he did write that ""Sunset Limited"" script. And now here comes ""The Counselor"" which he not only wrote specifically for the movies but helped produce. And it is some kind of car crash. It is full of beautiful people. Lord is it full of beautiful people -- Michael Fassbender as a crooked lawyer Penelope Cruz as his naive fiance Brad Pitt as a cowboy criminal Bardem again as a shady clubowner and Cameron Diaz as the femme fatale every story like this needs. And it is directed by Ridley Scott who knows how to make everything look sexy. Hes kept busy here too. The film starts with a raunchy bed scene between Fassbender and Cruz and not only puts Diaz in a precariously draped towel but then has her indulge in some auto erotica. No not that. She literally makes love to a car or rather a cars windshield. And believe me you dont want to know even if you think you do. But the story -- which involves a drug cartel a get-rich-quick scheme a double-cross and a lot of bloody reprisals -- doesnt make a lick of sense. Its meant to be tricky and clever (Pitts character even deliberately quotes a line from ""Body Heat"" as if to promise all sorts of nasty pleasures). But all that follows is confusion. Of course Scott whos always had a great eye has never had a fine sense of story; the film seems an hour longer than it is with too many scenes that go nowhere. Fassbenders character for example doesnt just present Cruz with an engagement ring; we first have to follow him to Amsterdam to watch him pick out the precise stone. But -- why exactly? Well so we can get an overly stylized lecture from a diamond dealer on how these beautiful objects are in fact mistakes how its is the flaws that make diamonds interesting. (And write that metaphor down -- itll be on the quiz later). Except this movies flawed characters arent interesting just loaded with painful significance. They walk around like symbols. (The Counselor for example apparently has no name -- hes just ""The Counselor."") They pronounce profundities like ""The truth has no temperature."" They have sex with cars or their body doubles do. Sorry Im still trying to get that one out of my mind. Still the pretty people seem to be having a lot of fun here particularly with the dialogue which can sound awfully literary if youre not. Diaz sports a leopard-print tattoo that curls down the small of her back (please nobody tell Snooki) and Bardem once again rocks some hideous hair. Cruz and Pitt have little to do beyond looking beautiful though although they pull that off handily. Fassbender however just looks lost. And who could blame him? Because as a character the Counselor is never more than a dumb cypher. There is one bright criminal in all of this though and thats whoever cut the trailers for this thing and somehow made it look fun. Its the clearest cleverest act of fraud since the last Wall Street scandal and one I can only hope audiences dont succumb to.

Until this mixed bag of entertainment value came along I was ready to crown ""Killing Season"" wherein a neckbearded John Travolta sports a terrible Serbian accent while hunting aged militant Robert De Niro as this years top guilty pleasure. But ""The Counselor"" which also features an impressive set of stars wrestling with inherently silly material offers a far more satisfactory combination of ridiculous characterizations and bleak showdowns. Its a familiar world of secular finality littered with absurd and eccentric extremes ""No Country For Old Men"" on a bender. McCarthys first screenplay involves the downward spiral in the life of a high-rolling lawyer (Michael Fassbender in a nameless role) who inhabits a cozy affluent existence with his fiancee (Penelope Cruz) until a sudden miscommunication with one of his jailed clients puts him on the hit list of the Mexican drug cartel. But it takes a good hour for that crucial plot point to arrive; until then Scott and McCarthy create an absorbing environment of slick maniacal personalities relishing in their affluence. Chief among them is embezzling drug lord Reiner (Javier Bardem nearly one-upping his slimy turn as last years Bond villain) who enjoys a hard-partying lifestyle with his sultry Lady Macbeth-like femme fatale partner Malkina (Cameron Diaz inexplicably slipping in and out of a Latina accent). Then theres the smooth-talking Westray (Brad Pitt) a middleman who works with the Counselor when his clients illegal dealings cause trouble. While obviously not as far-reaching at Scotts last filmmaking outing ""Prometheus"" theres a certain alien dimension to the world in which Scott roots these characters As later scenes make clear the movies male leads live in a bubble of hedonism away from the deadly ramifications of their actions... until the cartel decides to take action against them. The bloody results include a terrifically executed shootout and a handful of grisly death scenes including more than one inventive means of mutilation. But McCarthys script counteracts these flashes of intensity with hilariously extreme lyrical tangents and curiously theatrical wordplay. In one of these the Counselor finds himself entangled in a prolonged discussion with a philosophically minded crime boss who sounds like hes read too much Nietzsche (""The extinction of all reality is a concept no resignation can encompass""). Then theres the self-consciously wacky and erotic monologue delivered by Bardens spiky-haired philanderer as he recalls the time Diazs sultry Malkina humped his windshield leading to a fish-behind-the-glass metaphor that makes for one of the more amusing standalone sequences of the year. So yes ""The Counselor"" has its fair share of outlandish tangents and cartoonish overstatement as it outlines the lives of bored neurotic people divorced from the harshness of the real world. But unlike say ""The Canyons"" -- another movie released this year to take a stab at dreary portraiture -- ""The Counselor"" carries a winking quality to the way it frames excess and the fallout. Scott remains a keen director of intimate drama that works in spite of the materials inherently ludicrous ingredients and McCarthys capacity to find the poetry in disarray transcends the messiness of the material -- to a point. Undoubtedly one of the weirder narratively sophisticated adult dramas released by a major studio this year ""The Counselor"" is also just enjoyable enough to hint at the unrealized potential of the main talent behind its creation. As it happens ""The Counselor"" arrives in theaters this week at the same time as another slick movie about the marriage of corruption and economic drive. ""Capital"" French octogenarian filmmaker Costa-Gavras enjoyably twisted look at a banking moguls rise to power similarly documents the endlessly destructive machinations of men in suits. Gad Elmaleh stars as shifty Marc Tourneuil the newly minted CEO of a global financial powerhouse thrust into the position when his aging boss falls ill. While much of the board roots for Marc to fail so they can plant a replacement Marc decides to please overseas shareholders by laying off half the company. Drunk on authority he grows increasingly attracted to a freewheeling lifestyle epitomized by his attraction to the seductive model Nassim (Liya Kebede) a drug-guzzling partier who makes Diazs Malkina in ""The Counselor"" look relatively conservative in her ways. Gavras is getting up there but ""Capital"" feels like the opposite of an old mans film and utterly in tune with the directors other studies of political disarray (""Z"" ""State of Siege""). The new movie falters when it fails to build on a scenario established fairly early on but acutely hovers in disharmony particularly once the pace grows increasingly frenetic with its depiction of Marcs crazed dictatorial mindset. The director routinely illustrates his anti-heros fantasies of lashing out at anyone challenging his word including one particularly shocking moment when he literally reaches into a video conference call to assault a condescending colleague. Despite these sudden bursts of violence ""The Capital"" maintains a firm sense of realism. Unlike ""Counselor"" Gavras never forces the material into allegorical turf; its a relatively straightforward look at the ramifications of getting blinded by dollar signs with perhaps one of the most clearly defined visions of economic depravity since ""Wall Street."" Emphasizing that connection perhaps a little too bluntly ""Capital"" has its own version of Gordon Gekkos famed ""greed is good"" speech here delivered to a roomful of shareholders and revolving around the notion of banking executives as inverted Robin Hoods funneling money upward to the open arms of the one percent. Despite the transparency of its ideas ""Capital"" provides a fascinating thematic contrast to this weeks biggest release While ""The Counselor"" finds the villains of socioeconomic imbalance lurking in the shadows ""Capital"" shows them hiding in plain sight. Criticwire grades ""The Counselor"" B ""The Capital"" B+ HOW WILL THEY PLAY? Fox releases ""The Counselor"" nationwide on Friday where its genre appeal and A-list cast should attract solid box office on an otherwise weak weekend for big new releases (the only real competition is latest ""Jackass"" film). However its commercial prospects are likely to drop off quickly due to mixed word of mouth and other releases in the pipeline. Cohen Media Group opens ""Capital"" in New York this weekend where its unlikely to generate much attention though could wind up doing solid business in ancillary markets.

Cool."" -Richard Roeper MOVIE INFORMATION The Counselor(2013; R)In theaters Friday 25 October 2013Genre Crime Drama ThrillerDirector Ridley ScottCast Goran Visnjic Brad Pitt Michael Fassbender Penelope Cruz Cameron Diaz New Richard Roeper reviews weekdays at 500 PM ET only on REELZCHANNEL (35) Post a Comment  Mikesaid on Tuesday September 02 2014 115016 AMOne of the few times in which I could not disagree more with Richard. An ""A+""?. Really? I have not decided what in my opinion is Ridley Scotts best movie but as soon as I saw this piece of garbage I knew what his worst movie is. Cameron Diaz gives the worst performance of her craeer in this horrible movie. Why did she not receive a Razzie nomination? The story the script the characters are just plain awful. As is the case with Cameron Diaz I am floored that this movie did not even get nominated for the Worst Picture Razzie. By far THE worst movie of 2013. LeMontsaid on Monday July 21 2014 35103 PMThought it was a very good movie I just think you werent supposed to ""like"" it hal clarksaid on Friday March 21 2014 70430 PMI could barely watch the Counselor and turned to the Internet to see if anyone felt about it as I did. It is the only movie ever that having watched it on dvd I destroyed the dvd. I have never seen any film that deserves the description of absolute and total rubbish apart from this one. The photography is the only notable feature. It is a movie without a coherent plot or story meaningless scenes strung together pathetic characters poor writing and a thoroughly disappointing experience. The opening scene is abominable. I feel sorry for the actors being put through it and having to recite disgusting dialogue devoid of all meaning or purpose. Sex tastefully done may have a place in mainstream movies; pornography does not. I was drawn to purchase this movie without having read any reviews in advance by the exceptionally talented participants - cast director writer. But they wasted plus 2 hours of my life. Kylesaid on Saturday March 15 2014 35103 PMWow I am stunned that I didnt notice this movie had been released year. I just watched it after renting and I think it was actually the best work of Ridley Scotts career. I love the subplots and dense dialog and symbolism that persistently draws out like a blade. You know whats coming but you are pinned to your seat to watch it unfold. This is classic denouement delivery with a contemporary spin. Awesome film And for those who say it makes no sense please watch it again and pay closer attention. AmberHayessaid on Thursday March 13 2014 85923 PMI saw the Counselor after seeing wonderful reviews I like intelligent movies I didnt feel very intelligent after seeing it there were too many gaps it didnt connect I watched a movie before that called Disconnect which should have been this movies name and The Counsellor could have been an alternate name for Disconnect had it been told in a third person objective or say a therapists stories of separate clients that connected in a way that they all disconnected confused well I was too with The Counselor yet I dont think its as terrible as people say but it Definately missed the mark too much dialog trying to hard to be smart when the intelligence was a mere smokescreen the best part of the movie was the scenery absolutely beautiful cinematography but it shouldve been with the budget it had but the acting and everything else fell flat it was very disturbing however truth is it gave me nightmares Joesaid on Saturday February 15 2014 40353 AMLook Roeper you are pretty close to on point with 70% of your reviews then another 25% I disagree with but can respect but when it comes to Ridley Scott you have the weirdest ""lets just overlook logic and narrative because Ridley Scott"" blindspot Ive ever seen. What are you thinking man? Being obtuse and narratively muddled does not make you smart and admitting to not caring for such hapahazardly told stories does not make you ignorant and ""not getting it"". You need to learn that when it comes to Ridley Scott the emperor has no clothes specifically the guy can create cool looking films but he doesnt care about narrative making any logical rational sense. Graysonsaid on Tuesday January 28 2014 90741 PMWell I liked it. I can see an average movie goer being frustrated with it though. Its certainly not for everyone and Im not trying to be condescending. Agamemnonsaid on Wednesday December 04 2013 42012 PMThe ones who are not into philosophy and intellectual way of thinking can easily get bored while watching this movie. It gives you arguments about life and makes you connect the scenes in your mind. But of course as an ignorant you can say that the scenes doesnt have any continuity. P.S. You can watch your lovely cheetahs on National Geographic Channel ;) matt Montoyasaid on Wednesday November 27 2013 72157 AMhttp//www.salon.com/2013/10/26/meet_the_worst_movie_ever_made/ See You peole are crazy This is the worst film ever made and I want my money back Dirk Krausesaid on Thursday November 07 2013 80839 AMRichard I have to say that after reading your review about The Counselor I had to see the movie to make sure that Im right about something. That is that I almost always agreed with Roger Eberts reviews but so far not many of yours. Everyone is entitled to their opinion but yours makes more of an impact on the public and I believe it is important for you to be honest. To say this movie was an A+ is ridiculous. The movie made very little sense it was as one scene went to the next without any continuity. I went with 3 other people and we all left there wondering what the heck we just watched. We were going to leave halfway through (which we should have we couldve got our money back) but we watched until the end and we could hear people around us saying ""I think its over"". No one could believe it was over. I left there feeling it was the worst movie I have seen in the last 30 years seriously. I did love the cheetahs.

Photo Kerry Brown Twentieth Century Fox The Counselor review A lawyer crosses the line 1 / 5 Back to Gallery The Counselor Drama. Starring Michael Fassbender Penelope Cruz Cameron Diaz Javier Bardem and Brad Pitt. Directed by Ridley Scott. (R. 117 minutes.) Ridley Scott directed ""The Counselor"" but this is Cormac McCarthys film all the way a showcase for his original screenplay and what a screenplay it is. Its possible there has never been anything like it. It contains memorable dialogue vivid characters and several superb scenes and yet it still manages to be wrong a complete miscalculation. It starts well enough. Two people are rolling around under the sheets one bright morning and soon you see that its Michael Fassbender and Penelope Cruz - so yes there is something here for everybody. Scott films their morning banter in tight close-ups that make them look like the most beautiful people on the planet. All the audience wants to do is what the characters want to do - stay there in bed the whole movie. But no the story must kick in and for a while its promising. Fassbender plays an American lawyer in El Paso who is putting up the money for some kind of drug deal. The details are vague but the situation forces him to have long sit-down conversations about it first with his business partner Reiner (Javier Bardem) and next with Westray (Brad Pitt) who is brokering the deal. Both men try to warn him that the life he is about to enter is much harder to leave and these conversations are fun to sit in on even if Bardem seems uncomfortable with the complicated dialogue passages. To be sure some of the conversations sound like a writer typed them. They dont quite sound like real talk and yet the tinge of artificiality is almost a virtue. Its stylistic ""You dont really know a man until you know what he wants."" We look forward to a story about a guy with absolutely everything to live for - as in he is about to marry Penelope Cruz - who gets involved in something dangerous and consuming. Long conversations But the counselor is a rather odd role and not in a good way. He is smart and looks fantastic in a suit. Today we might look at Fred Astaire to see what impeccable dress looked like in 1935. A few more movies like this and Fassbender will be the male fashion plate of our time. Yet whats underneath such crisply tailored immaculateness? The counselor starts the movie dependent on other people to do his will so he is inactive basically just waiting and hoping. Then through no fault of his own and with no participation on his part things go wrong and he becomes a helpless victim of circumstance. So just so we get this straight ""The Counselor"" is a movie about a guy who starts off not doing anything ... and soon ends up unable to do anything. He is passive then trapped. This is the protagonist. So heres the question If he is such an empty suit why make him the focus of a story? Of course we sit in the audience expecting him to spring into action to learn on his feet and become brilliant. We expect this not merely because weve been conditioned by other movies but because of the intrinsic demands of drama. But McCarthy never switches gears. The long conversations continue. At one point the counselor calls Ruben Blades - Blades might even be playing Ruben Blades for all we know; the character is not identified - and Blades instead of helping him launches into some half-baked philosophy about irrevocable choices and the journey toward acceptance. Its only midway through that we realize that this is not only Blades snowing the counselor. McCarthy is snowing us. Evil but silly Cameron Diaz has a vivid role as a misogynistic fantasy and the polar opposite of Cruz. If Cruz plays a mans vision of all that is soft sexual and welcoming Diaz plays all that is angular cold and frightening. We know all we need to know about her from her erect posture the silver nail polish that looks like bullets and the leopard-spot tattoos on her back. If McCarthy wants to locate all the evil in the universe in Diaz she is up for it and she runs with it. But in the end its all rather silly. ""The Counselor"" is about as nihilistic as McCarthys ""No Country for Old Men"" but without the Coen brothers sense of humor or sense of drama.

(Kerry Brown) D+ The Counselor Genre Thriller; Starring Javier Bardem Penelope Cruz Cameron Diaz Michael Fassbender Brad Pitt; Director Ridley Scott; Release Date Wide 10/25/2013; Runtime (in minutes) 111; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Fox Filmed Entertainment Posted November 1 2013 -- 1200 AM EDT Considering the deep bench of A-list talent involved Ridley Scotts new Southwestern noir The Counselor is a jaw-dropping misfire. The dialogue is laughably pretentious the plotting is virtually nonexistent and the performances are so broad and cartoony that you keep wondering if its all some sort of prank. Reteaming with Ridley Scott after the disappointing Prometheus Michael Fassbender stars as a smooth naive lawyer operating in the moral grey zone along the border between Texas and Mexico. Its a godforsaken land where drugs are cheap and life is cheaper. After years defending crooked clients there Fassbenders ""Counselor"" finds all of the easy money too tempting to resist. So he sells his soul and saddles up with a ring of flashy bad guys for a big drug-smuggling score. Theres Javier Bardem as Reiner a spiky haired playboy who looks like he picked his wardrobe from a Siegfried and Roy yard sale; Brad Pitt as Westray a charismatically mysterious stringy-haired hood who speaks in cryptic riddles; and Cameron Diaz as Malkina a sex-crazed harpy covered in tattooed spots to match her pet cheetahs. (This is the films subtle idea of character development.) For all of her man-eating efforts in the film Diaz is punished with one of the most wince-inducing scenes in years -- a spread-eagle masturbation spectacle performed on the hood of Bardems yellow Ferrari that Id say has to be seen to be believed. But I wouldnt want to encourage anyone to cough up ten bucks to sit through it. If the films posse of ethically shady villains seems right out of a bad Cormac McCarthy novel thats because it more or less is. The Counselor is the celebrated bard of the borderlands first feature-film screenplay. And as Fassbenders drug deal goes sour putting his fiancee (Penelope Cruz) in harms way hes forced to listen to a lot of poorly-sketched characters wander on screen and deliver stilted metaphorical speeches about greed and the evil that men do. All of this may have seemed fine and dandy on the page. But I suspect that McCarthy is about to find out the hard way that writing novels and writing screenplays are two very different things. In No Country For Old Men the Coen brothers wisely stripped the authors doomed tough-guy dialogue and injected it with a stiff dose of harrowing naturalism. But operating on his own here McCarthys unchecked macho arias leave you sitting there slack-jawed wondering if he has any idea how people talk in real life. Scott doesnt do him any favors either. The director surrounds the garishly painted characters in excessive dollops of glitzy opulence hammer-to-the-skull symbolism and sex scenes that are as embarrassing as they are unerotic -- the films paranoid view of women comes off as downright Neanderthal. I suppose the only good thing than can be said of a movie as bad as The Counselor is that its existence is a reminder of just how right Hollywood usually gets it. Big honking bombs as bad as this one are like solar eclipses. Rare and not be looked at directly. D+ Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

MOVIE REVIEW The Counselor Dazed and confused. Running time 117 minutes. Rated R (graphic violence grisly images sex profanity). At the Empire the Beekman the Union Square others. Like ""Traffic on a massive dose of downers Ridley Scotts ""The Counselor is a great-looking and star-filled but lethally pretentious talky lethargic drama about drug smuggling across the US-Mexican border. Except for when Cameron Diazs character doffs her panties and pleasures herself up against the windshield of her stupefied boyfriends convertible (sans actual nudity) its a snoozy bore. ""The Counselor cant honestly be classified a thriller because nearly every plot twist is telegraphed by reams of stilted dialogue provided by novelist Cormac McCarthy in his first original screenplay. ""The counselor"" is an unnamed lawyer played by Michael Fassbender whom we first see performing oral sex on his fiancee (Penelope Cruz) in their real-estate-porn home then purchasing a huge diamond ring for her in Amsterdam. To pay for the ring and their lavish lifestyle the counselor makes a ""one-time investment in a drug deal despite a lecture about morality and the potentially very ugly downside from a middleman in the deal (a ponytailed Brad Pitt rocking designer suits and suffering an especially gory demise in a relatively small supporting role). Its not surprising at all that things go horribly wrong. A septic-waste truck smuggling the drugs -- mind-numbingly shown over and over -- is hijacked. The cartel is not inclined to accept the counselors (true) protestations that its just a coincidence that he is the court-appointed lawyer for the mother (Rosie Perez) of the culprit. A very fine actor as we saw again last week in ""12 Years a Slave Fassbender doesnt have much to do except look increasingly worried -- and cry in several scenes -- in a severely underwritten role while Cruz functions strictly as a potential victim. The counselor is also partnered in a nightclub with a wackier investor (Javier Bardem who has no scenes with real-life wife Cruz) in the same drug deal. His loquacious character sports a spiky Brian Grazer-esque fright wig thats even worse than the infamous pageboy he wore in ""No County For Old Men the vastly superior adaptation of McCarthys novel. Bardem is encouraged to go way over the top but its nowhere near as scary as the hamming indulged in by Diaz as his psychotic girlfriend. Miscast in a role originally intended for Angelina Jolie she makes a highly improbable criminal mastermind who in the films most ridiculous scene tries to pre-confess her sins to an unwilling priest. But then what would you expect from a character who is not only equipped with a pair of pet cheetahs but a soliloquy about them? Like every other scene in this movie it drones on and on. For all its endless prattle about morality ""The Counselor is a rare movie about drugs that doesnt show drug use or its consequences -- at least for users. For those in the business it can be very grisly indeed.

"Review The Counselor a bleak waste of A-list talent - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review The Counselor a bleak waste of A-list talent The Counselor Movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews The Counselor starring Michael Fassbender Penelope Cruz Cameron Diaz Javier Bardem and Brad Pitt. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews The Counselor starring Michael Fassbender Penelope Cruz Cameron Diaz Javier Bardem and Brad Pitt. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic As cold precise and soulless as the diamonds that figure briefly in its plot ""The Counselor"" is an extremely unpleasant piece of business. You could call it ""Three Beheadings and No Funeral"" but even that doesnt give an accurate idea of what youre in for.The film is ably directed by the veteran Ridley Scott and features a high-powered cast headed by Michael Fassbender Penelope Cruz Cameron Diaz Javier Bardem and Brad Pitt none of whom seem to realize that the gem they are so assiduously polishing is pure cubic zirconia and not the real thing. Thats because everyone here is the prisoner of ""The Counselors"" clumsy puppet master screenwriter Cormac McCarthy. Yes that Cormac McCarthy whos apparently been eager to write directly for the screen for some time but should have stifled the impulse.PHOTOS Billion-dollar movie club For though hes a Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award winner and has had several of his novels -- including ""No Country for Old Men"" ""The Road"" and ""All the Pretty Horses"" -- made into films McCarthy has not done himself or his reputation any favors with this original.This terminally bleak story of a lawyer (Fassbender) who gets in way over his head when he becomes part of a multimillion-dollar drug deal with a Mexican cartel is so entranced with its pseudo-mythic qualities that we never learn what the attorneys name is Everyone just calls him ""counselor.""A key difficulty is that this plot is so predetermined there is little point in seeing it through to the end. Both the counselor and his girlfriend Laura (Cruz) are so bleakly fated from frame one to have the most awful things happen to them they might as well have ""helpless victims"" written on their sleeves.Another problem is that McCarthys famously enigmatic dialogue turns out to work better on the page than on the screen. Hearing lines such as ""truth has no temperature"" and ""grief transcends value"" spoken by flesh-and-blood individuals makes the words sound hollow stilted and theatrical. PHOTOS Hollywood backlot momentsUnfortunately McCarthys words are at their weakest in the films opening scene in an El Paso bedroom where the counselor and Laura are discovered under the sheets in the middle of a marathon session of lamour. The dialogue between them is frank adult and so unconvincing that its an embarrassment the film never recovers from.After a trip to Amsterdam to buy a diamond for an engagement ring the counselor looks up Reiner (Bardem) a nightclub owner with a passion for Versace shirts and unspecified connections to the drug trade. Its not completely clear why the counselor wants into the business but he is not easy to dissuade.Met next is the equally enigmatic Westray played by Pitt and beautifully costumed by director Scotts longtime designer Janty Yates to look like a hipster version of Hank Williams. Westray has connections to the cartel and the same flat oracular way of speaking as everyone else. He too tries to talk the counselor out of his chosen path but this guy is too cocky to listen to anyone.While all these men think they are slick operators it soon becomes apparent that the blackest most conniving heart in the group belongs to Reiners girlfriend Malkina played with convincingly frigid nastiness by Diaz.PHOTOS Celebrities by The TimesThe owner of two pet cheetahs and enamored enough of the animals prowess in killing to have its markings tattooed on her back Malkina is such a creature of pure evil she scares a priest out of his confession booth and in general makes Cruella de Vil seem as harmless as Mary Poppins.While all these people are trading bleak and inscrutable McCarthyisms an ancient septic tank truck is making its way to the United States from Mexico. Except its not really a septic tank truck; its insides contain the drug shipment that the counselor has his heart set on.The movements of this truck may not sound very exciting but you will find yourself longing for its presence because it replaces the toxic characters whose escapades end in misery pain and yes no fewer than three beheadings. The milk of human kindness does not flow through ""The Counselors"" veins not even close.kenneth.turanlatimes.com ---------------------------The CounselorMPAA rating R for graphic violence some grisly images strong sexual content and languageRunning time 1 hour 57 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Stars who turned down or were turned down for ultimately famous roles Release date cheat sheet Monuments Men Jack Ryan and the rest 12 Years a Slave earns three Gotham Independent film nominations Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-the-counselor-review-20131025,0,4116157.story?track=rss",200,thecounselor18,thecounselor,latimes
"Golden tongues and black hearts enliven The Counselor review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesGolden tongues and black hearts enliven The Counselor reviewAn uncommonly erudite film built around the pulpiest of stories. Cameron Diaz is Malkina a woman without a conscience and Penelope Cruz is Laura in The Counselor.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Oct. 24 2013The CounselorStarring Michael Fassbender Brad Pitt Cameron Diaz Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem. Directed by Ridley Scott. Opens Oct. 25 at GTA theatres. 117 minutes. 14A Golden tongues and black hearts enliven The Counselor an uncommonly erudite thriller built around the pulpiest of stories.Its the classic situation familiar to students of Greek myth and Shakespearean drama of a moral man tempted by sin and hubris and brought low by fate who learns a hard lesson along the way.Article Continued BelowRidley Scott directs and gaudily attired A-listers supply wicked glamour in a drug-trade scenario that traverses the globe but mainly straddles the Texas-Mexico border.The films midnight essence however flows from the blood-filled pen of novelist Cormac McCarthy the No Country for Old Men author making his auspicious screenwriting debut here.Michael Fassbender is the title attorney no name given who seemingly has all that a man could desire. He lives well in El Paso dresses in Armani suits drives a Bentley and has a girlfriend Laura (Penelope Cruz) soon to become his fiancee who is madly in love with him. The ardour is mutual as an opening carnal romp and frank sexual banter make abundantly plain.Yet the Counselor wants more money for reasons McCarthy chooses to leave murky motivations always being the least of his concerns. Perhaps the Counselor just has debts that need paying such as the bill for the colossal diamond ring he buys in Amsterdam for Laura.A long-time client named Reiner (Javier Bardem) an affluent nightclub owner who dresses like the 1970s never ended has a big-money drug smuggling deal going down that the Counselor wants in on.Reiner is willing to cut him in but like most of the characters in this brainy slow-burner he also has a cautionary finger to wag ""If you pursue this road that youve embarked upon youll eventually come to moral decisions that will take you completely by surprise.""This isnt the kind of advice you expect from a man whose idea of a good time is to take his two pet cheetahs out to the desert to hunt and devour rabbits. Reiner cavorts with a sexually expressive girlfriend Malkina (Cameron Diaz) who has big-cat marks tattooed on her back long silver nails and no apparent sign of a heart or a conscience.The Counselor also gets life and business lessons from Westray (Brad Pitt) a Texas dandy with unexplained connections to the shadowy drug cartel the Counselor is getting involved with. (Expository scenes of how the drugs are smuggled across the border in sewage trucks and how errant souls are ruthlessly and cleverly dispatched make the film seem like a criminals how-to video at times.) Westray dresses like Hank Williams but talks like a philosopher adding a chilling note of menace to Reiners early warning ""You may think there are things that these people would simply be incapable of. There are not.""Most people would take pause at such dire caveats. Not the Counselor who is used to giving advice not receiving it. He proceeds into a destiny that will make regret seem the least of his problems but as capricious fate would have it its an act of kindness that leads to his undoing.Pay close attention to an early scene where Reiner and Malkina are watching their cheetahs chase jackrabbits skilled hunters versus defenceless prey.Theres a human analogy here. One of the many pleasures of The Counselor is trying to figure out which of the characters is a rabbit and which is a cheetah.Its not obvious; no one has completely clean hands or conscience. The sorting out of whos who is occasionally frustrating and always bloody but ultimately achieves a weird sense of poetic justice. Believe the character who warns ""the slaughter to come is probably beyond our imagining.""Read more about Brad PittThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

The film stars Brad Pitt Cameron Diaz Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem. VPC Claudia Puig USA TODAY 6 p.m. EDT October 24 2013Despite a script by a Pulitzer Prize winner a terrific ensemble cast and director Ridley Scott at the helm The Counselor is leaden murky and hard to follow.Michael Fassbender stars in the crime thriller The Counselor.(Photo Kerry Brown 20th Century Fox)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review 1/2 out of 4Stars Michael Fassbender Penelope Cruz Cameron Diaz Javier Bardem Brad PittRated R; Runtime 1 hour 57 minutes; opens nationwide FridayNever did drug lords thugs and cowboys wax as philosophically as they do in The Counselor (1/2 out of four rated R opens Friday nationwide).It certainly doesnt make them in any way believable. Nor does it make them any more intriguing to watch. Everyones speech is awash in gaudy psycho-blather and Yoda-like observations.The phony eloquence doesnt make the obfuscated and tedious story any clearer or more compelling.The screenplay the first by Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Cormac McCarthy sounds far more ornate than spoken dialogue would -- especially in this crime thriller milieu. Its hard to imagine perps and their victims would take the time to offer homilies and wise counsel as they pull off drug deals or run for their lives.STORY 5 things you should know about Michael FassbenderMORE Fassbender gets the job doneREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersMcCarthy is a wonderful fiction writer -- his spare prose in the masterful novel The Road is stunningly evocative. If only what came out of characters mouths here had been a bit more spare.And its not just the dialogue thats inane. The wannabe suspenseful story itself does not do justice to the talented cast caught in its convoluted web.The overwritten script and the ridiculous plot combine to make The Counselor a frustrating experience.The well-edited trailer makes it look much more exciting taut and captivating than it is. The actual movie is a casually violent and pretentious slog. Perhaps director Ridley Scott should have turned over the reins to whoever edited the trailer.All the perplexing commentary is meant to create an increasingly tense foreboding situation. But mostly it serves to distance the viewer from the far-fetched story of a respectable lawyer referred to only as ""The Counselor"" (Michael Fassbender). His one-time foray into illegal business draws him into a nightmarish scenario involving international drug traffickers a courier who takes risks on a motorcycle some pretty graphic torture devices and a pair of haughty jewel-collared cheetahs.On the plus side the Counselor has a pretty and supportive girlfriend named Laura (Penelope Cruz). But we sense early on that no matter if hes a great lover (as we glean from the aurally graphic first scene) and his intentions are true the Counselor will only bring pain to Laura.Cruzs role is a thankless one that could have gone to any number of lesser actors.Brad Pitt as Westray -- a bad guy in a white hat -- pops by occasionally to advise The Counselor in abstruse ways. We get it. Bad goings-on are afoot. Its only a matter of time. If only we cared.The Counselors dealings with Reiner a flashily dressed Javier Bardem are meant to be ominous. But mostly theyre just perplexing. Reiner is a malevolent presence but his wry sense of humor makes him see more clownish than evil. His rich but tacky girlfriend Malkina (Cameron Diaz) lacks Reiners wit. (Reiners digression about her unusual sexual proclivities is off-putting mystifying the audience as much as it does the Counselor.) Shes a narcissistic sociopath with a dated haircut and two-toned dye job.And speaking of hair one of the films highlights is Bardem in yet another terrible coif. It looks like someone styled his hair with an egg beater. Ever since his awful bowl haircut in No Country for Old Men the Spanish actor seems determined to ensure that his characters sport the worst dos imaginable. His role in the last Bond movie featured another hideous style bleached blond. If anyone ever makes a movie called Bad Hair Day Bardems the obvious star.Come to think of it sitting through that movie would be time better spent than a session with The Counselor. 20 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1gK6GNqFall Movies Calendar OctoberTake a look at the films heading to the box office this October.

Grade F Novelist Cormac McCarthy has won the Pulitzer Prize the National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award and the movie that the Coen brothers based on his ""No Country for Old Men"" earned multiple Oscars including best picture and best adapted screenplay. If theres any justice next year hell be able to add yet another illustrious award to his roster - a Razzie for worst screenplay for ""The Counselor."" This gaudy pseudo-existential crime drama about a mostly legitimate lawyer way over his head in a drug deal has been over-produced and over-directed (by Ridley Scott) and over-acted (by the entire cast). But the source of its abysmal quality is McCarthys original script. It intersperses bursts of grotesque violence - including a couple of novel beheadings - with bombastic or portentous dialogue thats just as lethal at least to the audience. I dont pretend to know what these trumped-up characters would sound like in real life. But if I were a romantic globe-trotting attorney like Michael Fassbender and I were engaged to Penelope Cruz Id run in the opposite direction if my partner in crime (Javier Bardem) said things like ""Men are attracted to flawed women too of course but their illusion is that they can fix them. Women dont want to fix anything. They just want to be entertained. The truth is you can do anything to them except bore them."" Bardems high-living club owner is bedding an international woman of mystery (Cameron Diaz) who enjoys watching one of her pet cheetahs chase down and devour a jackrabbit and likes to make love to a car (in this case seeing is not believing). She gives speeches too including one that ends ""... nothing is crueler than a coward and the slaughter to come is probably beyond our imagining. Should we think about ordering? Im famished."" The movie is set mostly in Mexico and the American Southwest but theres barely any simple down-home language to be heard. Even Brad Pitts wheeler-dealer in a cowboy hat gets downright Biblical when he spouts what he calls his new favorite toast - ""a plague of pustulant boils upon all their scurvid asses."" McCarthy has designed the plot simply to torment the title character for harboring the illusion that he could make one clean score in the cocaine trade. (Fassbender is equally adept at tears and perspiration.) Theres no mystery to be solved - you can spot the string-puller a hundred desert miles away. For regular theatergoers the only suspense comes from McCarthys adherence to the law of Chekhovs Gun - ""If in Act 1 you have a pistol on the wall then it must fire in the last act."" In ""The Counselor"" its not a gun but a ""bolito."" The club-owner in his first dialogue scene defines the bolito as a mechanical battery-driven device with a cable ""made out of some unholy alloy"" that an assassin will drop over a targets head like a noose. ""Pulling the cable activates the motor and the noose starts to tighten and it continues to tighten until it goes to zero."" Who talks like this? More to the point - who writes like this?

They may be animal or they may be digital but they stand out from everyone else because they dont moralize philosophize or dispense epigrams. They have spots but no lines and thats a blessing in this deep-dyed downer that Ridley Scott directed from an original script by Cormac McCarthy. WSJ film critic Joe Morgenstern reviews ""The Counselor"" based on the first screenplay by novelist Cormac McCarthy calling it ""one of the most howlingly pretentious boring films"" in a long time. Photo The Counselor/20th Century Fox. Mr. McCarthy is a celebrated author whose novels have been adapted--by others--into feature films with varying success ""The Road"" and ""No Country for Old Men"" are the two standouts. ""The Counselor"" represents his screenwriting debut and its infelicitous to say the least. In a film that dwells on decapitation and a ghastly gizmo that cuts carotid arteries before progressing to strangulation the cast is all but suffocated by the sententious dialogue of an airless drama. What an all-star cast it is. Michael Fassbender is the counselor of the title a stand-up guy who ignores good advice and takes a fateful first step on a path that leads to horror and ruin. (Hes referred to only as Counselor. Giving him a name would have made him less existential.) Penelope Cruz is Laura the blameless beauty he loves. Javier Bardem is Reiner a flamboyant nightclub owner who lures the hubristic hero into a Mexican drug deal that goes calamitously bad. Cameron Diaz is Malkina Reiners svelte malign wife. (Theyre the unfun couple who own the cheetahs and the first hint of Malkinas malignity is the pleasure she takes from watching one of the lissome beasts chase down a rabbit.) Brad Pitt is Westray a middleman whose main distinctions are a welcome lightness of spirit coupled with self-irony. The formidable Edgar Ramirez relegated to a minor role as a priest has one of the movies most fatuous scenes set in a confessional booth. Watch a clip from the Ridley Scott film ""The Counselor"" featuring Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz. A lawyer (Michael Fassbender) finds himself in over his head when he gets involved in drug trafficking. (Photo/Video 20th Century Fox) ""The Counselor"" abounds in atmosphere that alternates between elegance and scumminess the latter epitomized by a honey wagon and its excremental cargo. ( Dariusz Wolski did the striking cinematography.) The film is awash in sodden pensees about the sorry state of humanity (""Ive seen it all counselor"" Westray says. ""Its all s--t."") and solemn observations on mortality (""We announce to the darkness that we will not be diminished by the brevity of our lives.""). Scenes announce themselves too. Theyre exactly what they say they are despite gaps in literal information about the workings of the Mexican drug wars. Whats missing is dramatic subtext and surprise as well as any playfulness that might have kept us guessing about the plot. Beneath the fancy language is a cautionary tale about making our own fates. Could a director have changed the fate of the film without changing the script which seems to have been enshrined as some sort of scripture? Maybe so with more supple use of the humor that lurks in the horror and less straining for impact with pervasive violence relentless closeups and self-parodying speech rhythms. But impact has long been a Ridley Scott trademark and humor hasnt. I appreciated the moment when someone says ""What can I get you to drink?"" and the counselor mutters ""Hemlock."" By then though I could have used some too. Watch a clip from the film ""Blue Is the Warmest Color."" Adeles life is changed when she meets Emma a young woman with blue hair who will allow her to discover desire to assert herself as a woman and as an adult. (Photo/Video Sundance Selects) Blue Is the Warmest Color The original title of Abdellatif Kechiches romantic drama was ""The Life of Adele"" (""La vie dAdele""). Thats much better than ""Blue Is the Warmest Color."" Theres nothing warm about this French-language film. Its a superheated saga of love between two women--Adele a tender desperately needy high-school student played by Adele Exarchopoulos and Lea Seydouxs Emma an art student (with chic blue hair) whos a few years older and far more worldly. The performances are nothing less than astonishing. Its easy to understand why the Palme dOr at this years Cannes Film Festival went to both actresses though not easy for me to see why the movie itself was included in the unprecedented joint award. My reservation has to do with the filmmakers insistence on a running time of three hours. This self-important miscalculation renders the explicit sometimes beautiful sex sequences voyeuristic through repetition and inflates a frequently moving love story into a faux epic. ENLARGE Adele Exarchopoulos left and Lea Seydoux in Blue Is the Warmest Color Sundance Selects An eager reader and a thoughtful student Adele likes to analyze things for herself but theres no way she can understand her own feelings of fraudulence without following their lead. Wandering into a gay bar shes told that ""love has no gender...take whoever loves you."" That proves to be Emma whom she has already noticed with interest on the street and who makes her out to be straight ""but a little curious."" The love that grows between them is intense. Since the films triumph at Cannes its many ardent supporters have spoken of the ecstasy and fulfillment that Adele and Emma achieve. Yet theirs is an unstable relationship of unequals an anguishing folie of one not two that recalls another Adele the tortured woman played so brilliantly by Isabelle Adjani in Francois Truffauts ""The Story of Adele H""). This Adele has no life but the one she lives in Emmas glow. The most memorable moments of her turbulent journey are those in which she is seen at her neediest and most bereft a beautiful vessel that may never be filled. --J.M. Watch a clip from the film ""Spinning Plates"" a documentary about three unique restaurants and their respective owners. In the photo Francisco Martinez of La Cocina de Gabby holds his daughter Ashley. (Photo/Video Film Arcade) Spinning Plates Joseph Levys sneakily stirring documentary opens up feelings you would never have expected from the premise--a portrait of three American restaurants. If we are what we eat these three emporia dramatize who were becoming in our endlessly diverse nation. One of them in Chicago stands at the apex of contemporary gastronomy and uses high-tech tools to create edible abstractions--better tasting through molecular chemistry and artistry. Another is a venerable regionally celebrated pillar of its tiny Iowa community. The third in Tucson Ariz. is humble ethnic and struggling to survive. Its tempting to say these restaurants represent our blue and red divide though they cleave more clearly between molecular and nuclear cultures. In all three the people who run them enhance their cuisines with the same additive of passion and have struggled in the shadow of tragedy. ENLARGE Grant Achatz in Spinning Plates Film Arcade La Cocina de Gabby the Mexican restaurant in Tucson is out from town and next to a palm tree a traditional family enterprise thats make or break for the nuclear family. Francisco and Gabby Martinez own the place. She cooks food that her mother used to cook while her mother watches from the sidelines and the couples little daughter plays often restlessly. They cant afford child care they make no bones about their precarious plight. You root for them to make it though its clear that they may not. Breitbachs Country Dining goes back to 1852 and has been in the same family since 1891; Mike Breitbach its sixth-generation owner runs the thriving institution with his wife Cindy their two children and their son-in-law. Thriving is an understatement; the kitchen turns out vast quantities of hearty food for a loyal far-flung clientele and for townspeople who have keys to the place and come in to make themselves coffee whether or not its officially open. The most moving--and unexpected--part of this Iowa story is how the community responded to disasters that befell the restaurant in recent years. Our increasing penchant for poisonous political partisanship makes it easy to forget how kind and generous we Americans can be. Breitbachs serves as a reminder. Alinea is one of the worlds great restaurants and Grant Achatz its chef and owner is one of gastronomys brightest stars. While he speaks of food as art craft and science hes charmingly candid about the lengths to which his restaurant goes in pursuit of the esthetically exquisite or the deliciously absurd. Twelve hours of prep by five people for one bite? ""Thats absurd"" he says with a grin. ""Thats what we deal with every day. We deal with the absurd."" If that were all Alinea dealt with it wouldnt be the icon its become. And if Mr. Achatzs story were only about singular talent soaring ambition and the isolating competitiveness thats another emblem of his molecular culture he might be a fine subject for a different kind of documentary about exotic process and extravagant personality. He turns out however to be a perfect fit for this one. Growing up in surroundings that were anything but exquisite he shared the imprisoning experience of the restless child in La Cocina de Gabby. Hes a tough-minded intensely likable survivor of a terrible illness that could have ended his career before taking his life. And he sees himself doing in his special way what every cook does--serving up nostalgia along with new experiences and a depth of emotion that is every good restaurants blue-plate special. --J.M. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download ENLARGE The Road (2009) At least the father and son in ""The Road"" dont have to worry about global warming. The planet has gone cold after an unexplained apocalypse. Normally you give yourself to a movie suspending disbelief. In this one you hang on to yourself for dear life resisting belief as best you can in the face of powerful acting persuasive filmmaking and the perversely compelling certainty that nothing will turn out all right. The father played by Viggo Mortensen doesnt have a name because Cormac McCarthys novel didnt give him one but Mr. Mortensen gives him a gaunt grandeur. ENLARGE Your Sisters Sister (2011) A different take on same-sex love Lynn Sheltons beguiling tale turns on an unlikely triangle. One year after his brother died Jack (Mark Duplass) is bewildered bitter and existentially stuck. To get him unstuck Emily Blunts Iris the brothers ex-girlfriend sends him off for some self-reflection in her familys island cabin in the Pacific Northwest. Unbeknownst to Iris though the cabin is occupied by her sister Hannah ( Rosemarie DeWitt) who has just ended a lesbian relationship after seven years. Then Iris shows up and previously unacknowledged feelings suddenly surface on all sides. ENLARGE Soul Kitchen (2009) This delirious farce by the German-born Turkish filmmaker Fatih Akin doesnt flag for a single one of its 99 minutes. The charming nebbish at the eye of the tornado that passes for a plot is a young German-Greek restaurant owner named Zinos ( Adam Bousdoukos). Zinoss establishment is really a diner housed in a scruffy warehouse in a worn-out Hamburg neighborhood. Still the clientele loves the down-home cooking and the funky music.

(AP Photo/Copyright Twentieth Century Fox Kerry Brown) Kerry Brown This photo released by Twentieth Century Fox shows Michael Fassbender left as The Counselor and Javier Bardem as Reiner in the film ""The Counselor."" (AP Photo/Copyright Twentieth Century Fox Kerry Brown) In the noir novels and film of the 40s the desert between Hollywood and Tijuana was crawling with dames and desperadoes. The coin of the realm was real estate and every double-crossing cutthroat was a poet.In subsequent decades that sinister ethos migrated along the Mexican border toward Texas. In his novel ""No Country for Old Men"" Cormac McCarthy alluded to drug smuggling across the Rio Grande. In ""The Counselor"" McCarthys first original screenplay he digs deeper into the underworld where a narcotics network stretches from the slums of Mexico City to banks in the Bahamas.In its cross-cultural breadth director Ridley Scotts smart and violent film merits comparison to Steven Soderberghs ""Traffic"" but the dialogue delivered by the stellar cast is incomparably McCarthys. The nameless title character is a lawyer in the west Texas town of El Paso. He is in love with a Mexican maiden Laura (Penelope Cruz) and he expresses his ardor with explicit pillow talk and a 4-carat diamond ring he purchases in Amsterdam. A scene with the jeweler (Bruno Ganz) foreshadows a philosophical current that surges through the screenplay the pursuit of perfection is a deal with the devil.One face of the devil is Reiner (Javier Bardem) a cocaine kingpin who offers the counselor a vaguely defined job -- and an artfully worded warning about the potentially deadly costs. But the counselor is seduced by the accoutrements of wealth which in Reiners case include two cheetahs and a feline queen (Cameron Diaz with paw-print tattoos).The middleman in a deal to ship drugs across the border in sanitation trucks is a rhinestone cowboy called Westray (Brad Pitt) who adds another eloquent voice to the chorus of cautionary tales. The warnings come to bloody fruition when rivals waylay one of Reiners couriers (in a scene as shockingly methodical as Bardems use of a cattle-killing air gun in ""No Country for Old Men""). The counselor gets blamed for the hijacked shipment and Laura gets lured into the crossfire.Although hes a compromised character the counselors love for Laura make his hellish hounding hard to behold. Yet the dialogue describing his descent sustains our fascination for most of this thrill ride until Diaz gets into the act with some final-curtain blather about the sexualized thrill of the hunt. In the pitiless world of ""The Counselor"" theres a fiery chasm between law and order.What ""The Counselor""  Three and a half stars out of four  Rating R  Run time 157  Content Graphic violence sexuality drug content and strong language Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint No question about it the best feature of ""The Counselor"" the borderlands drug drama written by Cormac McCarthy and directed by Ridley Scott is the hair. Its the most compelling watchable risk-taking element of the entire cursed production. Theres Javier Bardems startling scared-porcupine coiffure Brad Pitts shoulder-length tribute to Lynyrd Skynyrd and Cameron Diazs migraine-inducing short/long brown/blond layer cake. They all play characters involved in the smuggling trade. Their hair warns us that they are capable of anything. At the more restrained end of things big-time attorney Michael Fassbender wears a conservative Ivy League cut and his kittenish fiancee Penelope Cruz favors flirtatious curls regulation looks for a couple of squares far out of their depth. As for the story connecting these characters I throw my hands up. I read McCarthys opaque allusive screenplay then watched the film. Beyond the idea that freelancers shouldnt try to cut in on the drug cartels action I confess I scarcely understand it in either form. A legendary filmmaker and a Pulitzer Prize-winning author tackle exotic locales twisted crime and a man in over his head and somehow produce two hours of baffling tedium. Everyone looks intense and sexy and speaks in epigrams or windy philosophical monologues. Setups introductions inciting incidents? Forget about it. This is a crime drama of high abstract artistic aspirations -- ""Scarface"" pulp spliced with ""The Tree of Life"" abstraction. the counselor  out of 4 stars Rating R for graphic violence some grisly images strong sexual content and language. Bardems character Reiner a shady flamboyant guy tells Fassbenders a nameless lawyer eager to dabble in the lucrative drug traffic on the Ciudad Juarez/El Paso border ""I dont speak in arraignable phrases."" Few of the other players converse intelligibly either. What they do say is telegraphic full of threat and maddeningly indrawn as if theyre worried that clear speaking will bring the feds down on them. Something ""important"" is going on but the movie only hints at what that might be. Fancy cars mansions Uzis drugs its a blighted world ... something something. Butting against these lyrically vague passages are procedural scenes following 20 million worth of drugs in the belly of a grimy septic tank truck (symbolism). This sort of thing can work on the page but stripped of McCarthys poetic prose it rumbles and wheezes. Diaz channels Courtney Love as Malinka a femme fatale who has everyones number. Her pet cheetahs chase down hares as the predatory Diaz observes with field glasses and sips cocktails (symbolism). How bad-ass is she? She has a gold incisor and cheetah spots tattooed down her back. Somehow the wardrobe department restrained themselves from giving her an eyepatch and a hook. Not convinced shes bad news? Wait for the scene when she performs an autoerotic act on a Ferraris windshield that gives new meaning to the term ""wiper fluid."" Scotts visual imagery is self-consciously chic and glossy forced rather than forceful. Hes become clumsy around character-centered drama only responding to his actors when theyre doing something photogenic. Thus Fassbender weeps until saliva strings dangle from his mouth as the doomed sucker from polite society who only wanted to buy his girlfriend a big diamond. Of course the jeweler did warn him that the giant sparkler he chose ""is a cautionary stone."" No idea what that means but it sounds significant. As in Scotts previous fiasco ""Prometheus"" the capable Fassbender plays a closed-off character saddled with a murky agenda. Only this time hes a ninny not an android. Fassbender comes through at least as much as any actor could do playing a character who makes only bad decisions does unheroic things and gets punished relentlessly. The real crime in ""The Counselor"" isnt what the Mexican mafia does to interlopers its what the film does to its cast. And its audience. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 452pm on Thursday Oct. 24 2013 Thursday Oct. 24 2013 Thursday Oct. 24 2013 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Some studio execs must have thought theyd died and gone to Hollywood heaven.Heavy-hitter cast. Check.Famous director. Check.Big-name writer. Check.Box-office ka-ching. Not so fast.The minds behind the Texas-set would-be thriller The Counselor -- including writer Cormac McCarthy and director Ridley Scott -- forgot one thing a script that anyone cares about or heck even one that makes sense. Rarely has so much effort and star power been expended with so little result.The ubiquitous Michael Fassbender is an El Paso lawyer who is always simply addressed as Counselor. This Man With No Name seems to lead a charmed life with a sexy fiancee Laura (an underutilized Penelope Cruz) sharp clothes a cool car and presumably a bedroom full of high-thread-count sheets under which he and Laura make gloriously passionate love which is how the movie opens.For some reason -- financial concerns are vaguely referred to -- Counselor decides to get involved in the illicit cross-border drug trade through his club-owner friend Reiner (an oddly coiffed Javier Bardem) and one of Reiners contacts Westray (Brad Pitt). Of course this decision backfires after the murder of a courier -- in a totally improbable way that seems lifted from the game of Mouse Trap -- for which the cartels blame Counselor.Now neither Counselor nor any of his associates are safe. Meanwhile Reiners latest girlfriend the stridently sexual Malkina (a woefully miscast Cameron Diaz) whos so vixen-like and dangerous that she keeps cheetahs as pets is more than just arm candy and has secret motives of her own. She loses cool points though with her supposedly arousing acrobatics on the windshield of Reiners car. The display ranks as one of the most unintentionally comic scenes of the year. Cameron for the love of all that is Showgirls please stop.The only intriguing thing about The Counselor is the border setting though it has nothing new to say about the culture or the politics of region. Yet as with the West Texas-set FX series The Bridge it was mostly filmed elsewhere so even thats a cheat.Theres little suspense or any sense of tension even though Fassbender gives it his all as a man pushed to breakdown and actors like Panamanian singer Ruben Blades try to elevate McCarthys banalities to poetry. The Counselor is ultimate proof that just because an important writer (No Country for Old Men The Road) and a vaunted director (Alien Black Hawk Down Thelma amp; Louise) collaborate it doesnt mean the results will be remotely watchable.Those sounds you hear are the sighs of relief from Ben Affleck and Justin Timberlake. Runner Runner is no longer 2013s worst thriller. Cary Darling 817 390-7571; Twitter carydar Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

Kerry Brown/20th Century Fox The Counselor Director Ridley Scott Genre Crime drama Running Time 117 minutes Rated R for graphic violence some grisly images strong sexual content and language With Michael Fassbender Penelope Cruz Cameron Diaz Javier Bardem Brad Pitt It was Saint-Exuperys Little Prince who declared ""Its a little lonely in the desert."" Thats a notion writer Cormac McCarthy knows well his later novels often taking place in dusty Western locales among those isolated from society. But whats also even more true in McCarthys work is what the snake replies to the Little Prince ""It is also lonely among men."" McCarthys characters look for meaning and completion in others occasionally find it but ultimately find humanity at large -- and often themselves -- to be too self-centered and deeply flawed to overcome the fundamental solitude of existence. Thats certainly true in The Counselor McCarthys first produced screenplay written directly for the big screen. The pulpy story -- at its core a fairly simple one of a drug deal gone horribly awry for a newbie to North American drug trafficking -- gives the author ample opportunity to explore the notion that given the opportunity to allow our inherent greed to run rampant theres little that can save us from the consequences of our own worst inclinations. Michael Fassbender plays that newbie the unnamed Texas attorney referred to in the movies title. Hes a man who judging by the Bentley he drives and the impressive diamond he purchases at the start of the film to propose to Laura (Penelope Cruz) is doing pretty well for himself. But hes also a man of enormous appetites and despite finally meeting a woman capable of getting him to abandon his womanizing past his lust for money isnt so easily quelled. So he finds his way into a multimillion-dollar drug deal with his old pal Reiner (Javier Bardem for the second time sporting a ludicrous haircut in a McCarthy adaptation) and Reiners liaison with contacts on the Mexican side of the trade Westray (played with sleazy pragmatism by Brad Pitt). The self-confident air that presumably aids the counselor in the courtroom belies a deep naivete about the realities of the venture hes embarking on. And when things go wrong they go very very wrong. i Laura (Penelope Cruz right) may have gotten the lawyer to settle down but she couldnt stop him from getting involved with Reiner and his girlfriend Malkina (Cameron Diaz). Kerry Brown/20th Century Fox hide caption toggle caption Kerry Brown/20th Century Fox Laura (Penelope Cruz right) may have gotten the lawyer to settle down but she couldnt stop him from getting involved with Reiner and his girlfriend Malkina (Cameron Diaz). Kerry Brown/20th Century Fox Its a work filled to overflowing with subtext and thoughtful if bleak ruminations on our true natures -- on the inescapability of evil the pointlessness of grief the finality of death. Why then does Ridley Scotts film of the material -- despite an immersive central performance from Fassbender and McCarthys towering talent for arranging words like meticulous and austere flower arrangements -- ultimately feel so empty? Part of the issue may be that Scott in his later work has made a habit of keeping his subjects at a kind of lifeless distance. While hes always had a knack for well-placed restraint for much of the past decade that has translated into films of consummate professionalism that lack bite. While The Counselor is gorgeously staged and constructed Scotts slick straightforward style never quite meshes with the harsh grit of McCarthys observations on the human condition. The world McCarthy creates is not quite our own. Characters speak in openly philosophical terms that arent quite natural often ending conversations with the sort of meditative aphorisms that are more often written than spoken aloud. When Reiner points out the emotional chill in a viewpoint expressed by his scheming and severe girlfriend Malkina (Cameron Diaz) she responds ""I think the truth has no temperature."" Theres an element of the surreal in that approach and McCarthy uses that unreal world along with a generous helping of the blackest humor to illuminate the harsh and unfunny realities of our own lives. But Scotts formality has a tendency to handcuff the more fanciful elements on the page. If The Counselor is a failure its at least a fascinating one. Much of the reason for that is time spent in the theater examining why the film isnt working. The plot doesnt provide enough distraction to hold those thoughts at bay and this is where McCarthy betrays himself to an extent. The boilerplate pulp of his story lacks much in the way of the unexpected and is ultimately an insufficient delivery mechanism for the profundity his work aspires to like caviar dolloped atop a stale saltine.

To read the whole story subscribe to BostonGlobe.com THE COUNSELOR Share Comment Going into Ridley Scotts drug-trade drama ""The Counselor"" youve got a certain expectation that this could be the director delivering another of the stylish comparatively minor-note offerings interspersed among the genre biggies over the course of his career. Not ""Alien"" or ""Gladiator"" or ""Prometheus"" but a rewarding breather like the con yarn ""Matchstick Men"" albeit one with an all-star cast. But with its jangly (and nerve-jangling) vibe and the dramatically elliptical cool of its Cormac McCarthy script (the celebrated octogenarian authors first foray into screenwriting) the film is actually quite a bit more than that. This one has more in common with Scotts ""Thelma amp; Louise"" in the memorable way it escalates into a spin through wilder country and a meditation on bigger themes.

Rated R (violence language) BOTTOM LINE Tons of talent make a lead balloon in this dull nearly unwatchable would-be thriller. CAST Michael Fassbender Penelope Cruz Cameron Diaz Brad Pitt. LENGTH 153 For his first original screenplay ""The Counselor"" acclaimed novelist Cormac McCarthy goes for classic Hollywood Its a noir. It features a central sucker a femme fatale a good woman colorful crooks and expendable thugs. Its directed by Ridley Scott one of cinemas great stylists and features a cherry-picked cast of A-list stars. What could go wrong? As it turns out everything. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? ""The Counselor"" is a disaster on nearly every level but it all starts with McCarthys muddled mean-spirited screenplay. Its about an attorney known only as Counselor (Michael Fassbender) who joins a drug deal with nightclub owner Reiner (Javier Bardem) and slick kingpin Westray (Brad Pitt). Were not sure what motivates him but the Counselor does spend lavishly on his fiancee Laura (Penelope Cruz). Meanwhile snaking through the scenery is Malkina (Cameron Diaz) a kinky ice queen with leopard-print tattoos. When things go south the Counselor finds himself running from -- well we dont know and we never see them. The actors try to shine through this murk (Bardem and Pitt almost succeed) but theres no digging out from under McCarthys script written in an ear-halting mix of Biblical brimstone arcane verbiage and Philosophy 101. Filmmakers have successfully wrestled his novels onto the screen (the Coen brothers ""No Country for Old Men"" John Hillcoats ""The Road"") by paring them down and locating the visual ideas within but Scott (""Alien"" ""Blade Runner"") oddly does the opposite. Scott simply lets the characters talk talk talk. They describe death and sex and torture in flowery thesaurus-driven prose (""surety"" ""easeful"") while all we see are their yakking faces. As ""The Counselor"" nears its end it begins flailing and lashing out. Characters are murdered for unclear reasons and new ones appear without warning. ""The Counselor"" presents us with an ugly worldview but that is not the same as philosophical bravery. The movies real failing is easy to pinpoint Its unforgivably boring.

"The Counselor (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Counselor (R) Ridley Scott directs the first original screenplay by Cormac McCarthy starring Michael Fassbender Penelope Cruz and Cameron Diaz. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle cogleMiamiHerald.com10/24/2013 Editor rating 1.5 There are many signs that The Counselor is a ridiculous movie the pseudo-intellectual philosophy spouted by various characters including the leader of a Mexican drug cartel; Javier Bardems fright-wig hair; Cameron Diazs evil eyeliner one of the primary identifying factors of her bad-girl character. But my favorites are the cheetahs. Diaz plays a predatory blond named Malkina who has two cheetahs for pets (as one does). She decks them out in fancy collars and loves to watch them chase down and shred jackrabbits in the high desert of El Paso. Her admiring if somewhat clownish lover (Bardem) makes drinks and looks on in bemusement. If the eyeliner didnt clue you in to her motivations the cheetahs will. The Counselor comes with expectations Its directed by Ridley Scott with an impressive cast which also includes Michael Fassbender Penelope Cruz and Brad Pitt. Novelist Cormac McCarthy wrote the screenplay. If youve ever read his novels -- The Road No Country for Old Men Blood Meridian -- or even seen the films adapted from some of them then you know to expect blood violence greed nihilism and horrific deaths for at least 70 percent of the characters. What you dont expect is camp. The Counselor is more Wild Things than No Country for Old Men with which it shares a border town setting. But at least Wild Things knew what it was. The Counselor treats its material seriously and seems to have no idea its a joke that cant even muster up a bit of smarty-pants Tarantino cleverness or energy. The film follows the decision of an El Paso criminal defense attorney (Fassbender) to venture into the high-stakes world of drug trafficking (as one does). In a bit of coy artiness we never learn his name just as we never learn the names of other players in the great drug-trafficking machine (the Buyer the Jefe). The Counselor as his partners call him is in financial trouble although he flies to Amsterdam to buy a diamond for his lady friend Laura (Cruz). They are very much in love. ""I intend to love you until I die"" he tells her. She tells him that she hopes she dies first. You remember The Road and revel in the fact that though this is clearly not going to end well at least there wont be any cannibalism. So the Counselor sets out to participate in a drug deal with his flashy pal Renier (Bardem) though the exact details of his involvement are murky. He picks the brain of another acquaintance Westray (Pitt) a high roller in the biz who wears a cowboy hat and thankfully injects a bit of playfulness into the movie. He also warns the Counselor about the dangers presented by working with a Mexican cartel. One would assume a criminal lawyer living just outside Juarez might already understand the risk even if he hasnt seen a single episode of Breaking Bad but the Counselor is clueless -- and surprised when everything goes wrong. Just about everything goes wrong in Scotts film too although Fassbender is solid and Bardem and Pitt are amusing. But the script does them no favors and is even harder on the women. One doesnt expect enlightenment or female character development from McCarthy but The Counselor offers nothing beyond over-the-top whore/madonna cliches. We know nothing about Laura except whom she sleeps with. Does she have a job? Family? Friends? But Diaz gets the worst assignment as Malkina (who tells Renier when he suggests her responses are cold ""I think the truth has no temperature""). She shocks Renier by having sex with his car while he sits stunned in the passenger seat. Reniers description of the event shown in flashback is funny but the sight of Diaz writhing on the windshield doesnt help you share his horror. It just makes you feel sorry for Diaz and everybody else in this silly affected self-important movie.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Michael Fassbenders title character left is cooking up a shady deal with Reiner (Javier Bardem) in Ridley Scott and Cormac McCarthys ""The Counselor."" (Kerry Brown/Associated Press) By Ann Hornaday October 24 2013 Follow AnnHornaday By the looks of it ""The Counselor"" a rancid ultimately sodden crime thriller was made to appeal to several audiences among them fans of the cinematic stylings of Ridley Scott; acolytes of cult author Cormac McCarthy; and admirers of the Irish actor Michael Fassbender who between the 2011 drama ""Shame"" and the opening sequence of this movie has become Hollywoods go-to-sex-guy for explicit between-the-sheets adventures. In that naughty teasingly graphic scene with Penelope Cruz ""The Counselor"" which Scott directed from a screenplay by McCarthy supposedly lays its cards on the table This is a movie that will pull no punches when it comes to sex (and later violence) but will instead confront viewers with frank uncomfortably straightforward portrayals of the darkest parts of human nature. Sadly the filmmakers then dispense with any shreds of honesty they may have once aspired to by cutting to a shot of Cameron Diaz gorgeous in magic-hour amber light riding a horse while a cheetah runs alongside behind her. As Malkina the silver-clawed gold-saber-toothed femme fatale (who in case you missed the subtext also has a string of leopard-like spots tattooed down her back) Diaz is just one of the tawdry characters who populate the south Texas nether-world of ""The Counselor"" a sewage-soaked demimonde that is as confusing as it is spiritually compromised. It seems that Fassbenders title character -- attorney at large to all manner of lowlifes -- is in the midst of a shady deal involving Malkinas boyfriend Reiner (Javier Bardem) and a shadowy figure named Westray (Brad Pitt). Just what the deal is and how it all goes horribly wrong it seems are so tiresome -- and their moral universe so much more richly limned in ""Breaking Bad"" -- that McCarthy felt it necessary to gussy it up with windy Shakespearian speeches wearying conversational dead ends and lots of gratuitous swipes at female sexual appetites which are clearly a source of enduring and unresolved anxiety for the poor guy. Isnt McCarthy -- author of ""No Country for Old Men"" and ""The Road"" -- supposed to be the master of macho toughness and spare stylistic control? You wouldnt know it from this self-consciously nasty piece of borderland noir in which his familiar tropes by now look hackneyed and pathetic. ""The Counselor"" treats viewers to at least two baroquely staged beheadings and countless courtly disquisitions on morality mortality regret and heaven knows what else. Its an actors paradise all this poetic run-on musing but it results in a movie that despite its strenuous efforts to appear hardened and sexy and sleek is unforgivably phony talky and dull. It may be that ""No Country for Old Men"" was the perfect marriage of mannerisms McCarthys pseudo-depth and the Coen brothers reliably deadpan delivery system. With Scotts more florid hand at the helm the weaknesses and excesses stand out in sharp relief never more so than when the miscast Diaz delivers her carefully practiced arias to predation and Darwinian lust. ""The Counselor"" must have looked great on paper but you cant believe a word of it.  1/2 R. At area theaters. Contains graphic violence some grisly images strong sexual content and profanity. 117 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

"The Counselor 3 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article The Counselor 3 stars Brad Pitt in ""The Counselor.""Provided by thecounselormovie.com. SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED VIDEO ""The Counselor"" trailer By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Oct 24 2013 844 AM ""The Counselor"" arrives in theaters boasting a pedigree almost impossible to live up to. Small surprise then that it doesnt. Its an OK movie that seems like it should have been a great one but falls well short of that mark. Ridley Scott directs Cormac McCarthys first project written solely for the screen. The cast includes Michael Fassbender Brad Pitt Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz. What the heck lets throw Cameron Diaz in there for good measure. It deals with violence greed human weakness and lest we forget more violence. (McCarthy works in violence the way Ralphies furnace-fixing dad worked in profanity in ""A Christmas Story."" Hes a master.) Whats not to love? The film is actually pretty good in places a couple of scenes between Fassbender and Pitt in particular. But problems with pacing a sketchy story whose holes cant be filled in by the performances and most surprisingly dialogue that is often too smart (or at least too chatty) for its own good preventing the film from achieving what it might have. Call me crazy but if you are going to kill me in an insanely violent way please spare me the five-minute soliloquy on the existential nature of life and death and greed and love and all that. Just get it over with. On the other hand to paraphrase Chekhov if youre going to introduce a sadistic gizmo made of wire and a little motor that strangles its victim before slicing his carotid artery in some cases beheading him make sure you use it by the third act. Mission accomplished. Fassbender plays the title character never known as anything but. He is well-liked and respected but a cash-flow problem has evidently forced him to enter a massive drug deal. He works with Reiner (Bardem) a fast-living sort with the highest-maintenance of girlfriends Malkina (Diaz). Westray (Pitt) whose cowboy appearance belies his intelligence and ambition is also in on the deal. Complicating matters is the Counselors love for Laura (Cruz) the sort of love where you feel the need to go to Amsterdam to buy an engagement ring apparently. Why not? Malkina has a couple of pet cheetahs and has tattooed her body in homage. These people ... The deal goes wrong of course in explicitly lurid ways. The Counselor is never quite sure how which is fitting for a first-timer in so far over his head he has no idea what is coming next despite warnings from Reiner and Westray. Until he does and by then it is far too late. Its all artfully shot as we would expect from Scott. And there are plenty of lessons in morality courtesy of McCarthy. Most of the actors do what they do best -- and by the end Fassbender gets pretty close to greatness. But it never quite adds up. You cant shake the feeling that both Scott and McCarthy are aiming for something here that remains out of their reach. Its also tempting to say with McCarthy in mind and what seems like missing pieces that the book must surely be better than the movie. The problem is there isnt a book. Maybe there should have been.

Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday October 24 2013 111 PM Title The Counselor Film Info R Sexuality language violence. Area theaters. Deep inside ""The Counselor"" are facets of a good story about morality overtaken by greed. There are also good actors prowling about trying to make the best of the often ridiculous execution. But ultimately this dull tour of a thieving primal underworld is just a lot of high-talking hogwash. Michael Fassbender is an El Paso lawyer we know only as the Counselor -- since everyone refers to him often ridiculously as ""Counselor."" Hes got a new fiancee (Penelope Cruz lovely and smiley but underused) and a connection to a wealthy outlandish wanna-be club owner Reiner (Javier Bardem). The Counselor is upstanding but hes willing to throw it all away to make a killing from Reiners transport of diamonds from Mexico. The Counselor (Michael Fassbender r.) consults with a professional thief (Brad Pitt l.) in ""The Counselor."" After consulting with a pro larcenist (Brad Pitt) who knows the angles the Counselor prepares to watch the theft pay off. But Reiners scary girlfriend Malkina (Cameron Diaz) whose tattooed spots on her back resemble the ones on Reiners pet leopards is a wild card. Will she help make the Counselors deal go south? The movies real twist is director Ridley Scotts calm guidance of a showboating florid screenplay by author Cormac McCarthy. McCarthys terse spare books ""The Road"" and ""No Country for Old Men"" resulted in brutal gripping movies that didnt say much but packed a wallop. Here chattering characters deliver speeches with lines like ""The truth has no temperature"" and ""We announce to the darkness that we will not be made less by the brevity of our lives."" Javier Bardem plays an outlandish would-be club owner and Cameron Diaz is his dangerous girlfriend in ""The Counselor."" In the unpleasant world of ""The Counselor"" women are devious duplicitous or due for the trash heap and philosophical discussions come with the overly dramatic snapping shut of cigarette lighters. Garish deaths and a goofy reliance on sexuality devour any chance of subtlety. As for the cast Fassbender keeps things at a low boil but this great actor (currently playing real villainy in ""12 Years a Slave"") is stuck with a role no deeper than the android he played in Scotts ""Prometheus."" With his fluttering hands and electrified hair Bardem is fun and Pitt delivers a wily pros extended cameo though Diaz and Cruz spout some embarrassing dirty talk. Diazs carnal activity on a car windshield is like a Penthouse parody immediately becoming a bad-sexy moment to rival anything in ""Showgirls."" Penelope Cruz stars as Laura the Counselor fiancee who becomes an unwitting player in his dark dealings. This is a movie cut from other movies though making a point of quoting ""Mickey Rourke talking to whatsisname in Body Heat "" to signify where its going. When a thriller is so flawed it hopes to gain reflected luster like that its time to seek new representation. jneumaiernydailynews.com Catch ""Joe Neumaiers Movie Minute"" throughout the day Thurs. - Sun. on New Yorks WOR 710-AM and at wor710.com On a mobile device?

"The Counselor movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Shiny cast silly story in The Counselor McCarthys original script just not that originalOctober 24 2013|Michael PhillipsBrad Pitt and Michael Fassbender star in ""The Counselor."" (Kerry BrownTwentieth Century Fox Film Corporation)Set along the Texas/Mexico border but photographed largely in Spain ""The Counselor"" is novelist Cormac McCarthys first original screenplay to make it before the cameras. It concerns a self-deluding and financially challenged Texan who takes a chance involving some cocaine cartel money to dig himself out of a financial hole. Drugs; greed; malice; ridiculous lifestyle excess signified by the chief sociopaths pet cheetahs ""The Counselor"" offers all sorts of pulpy theoretical interest. As a bonus the violence showcases not one but two really nasty ways to die via beheading which is one more exotic method of killing than we got with the cattle stun-gun as deployed in the Oscar-winning ""No Country for Old Men"" taken from a McCarthy novel.""The Counselor"" is packed with cartel goons with bad teeth (just like the unsavory Mexicans of Hollywoods ethnically sensitive past) surrounding a cast directed by Ridley Scott including Michael Fassbender Penelope Cruz Cameron Diaz Javier Bardem and Brad Pitt. All that -- and yet dull. Why?For one thing McCarthys story zigs and zags but in slow motion. The character relationships lack the spark and juice of enjoyable trash. McCarthys dialogue suffers from an excess of capital-W Writing that doesnt sound like speakable human expression even flamboyant proudly artificial human expression. When someone accuses the Diaz character of being ""cold"" she fixes her opponent with a glare and replies ""Truth has no temperature."" There are two kinds of people in the world Those who will admire that line quite apart from the leaden way Diaz delivers it and those who wont.Fassbenders character whose twang carries a touch of the Old Sod needs dough to finance among other commodities a monster engagement ring for his intended (Cruz). She does not know about her mans deal with the cartel devils. Reiner Bardems character dominated by fright-wig hair in a permanent state of excitation is the sometime associate of the counselor and has brought the lawyer (Fassbender) in on a new nightclub project. Diaz portrays Reiners inhumanly tough mistress the cheetah wrangler resident sexual fuh-REAK and apparent string-puller of half the globes nefarious business interests.The narrative twists itself into pretzels trying to stay ahead of the audience. Fassbenders reactive patsy of a character exists to express shock at what his newfound colleagues will do in the name of frontier justice. Director Scott lends ""The Counselor"" a solid shiny level of craftsmanship. But even if weve never personally done these sorts of deals ourselves at least lately weve all been here before.mjphillipstribune.com""The Counselor"" - 2 starsMPAA rating R (for graphic violence some grisly images strong sexual content and language)Running time 157Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Life Skill 201 Washing a baseball capLongtime nursing home operators must face trial judge rules10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesCormac McCarthy keeps moviegoers guessing in The CounselorOctober 23 2013New Trailer For Ridley Scotts The Counselor Highlights...August 20 2013Michael Fassbender Gets In Over His Head in New Counselor...August 7 2013Counselor suspends production after Scott death Ridley...August 20 2012Marion Cotillard Set to Topline Macbeth Opposite Michael...August 21 2013Find More Stories AboutCameron DiazJavier BardemMichael FassbenderCounselorTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/site/chi-counselor-review-1018-20131024,0,2943257.column",200,thecounselor34,thecounselor,chicagotribune

The trailers for Ridley Scotts ""The Counselor"" make it look like the kind of gonzo crime thriller his brother Tony used to make. Au contraire this Cormac McCarthy-scripted potboiler turns out to be a chillingly detached borderline-sociopathic account of how getting mixed up in a Mexican drug deal can ruin the lives of all involved. (Hint Its a good way to wind up pickled in septic barrels or headless in a landfill.) What might have made a mean sinewy indie thriller escalates in budget but not necessarily excitement as Scott and an appallingly miscast group of A-list stars fumble their way through thickets of dense philosophical dialogue alienating audiences who wouldve happily settled for a more conventional genre movie.This story first appeared in the October 29 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. Capitalizing on the love Hollywood has shown him with its adaptations of ""No Country for Old Men"" ""The Road"" and ""All the Pretty Horses"" McCarthy decided to stray from his comfort zone of terse no-nonsense novels to try his hand at screenwriting cooking up a globe-spanning doozy with roots just south of the Rio Grande border. The title -- a perverse lawyer joke considering that the counselor in question spends all his time seeking advice from others -- refers to the pics protagonist a typically by-the-book Texas attorney (Michael Fassbender) who his back against the metaphorical wall decides just this once to openly violate the law. Whatever his strengths in print McCarthy clearly doesnt understand how drama and suspense work onscreen pouring most of his efforts into crafting impenetrably baroque conversations between loosely sketched stereotypes wrongheadedly convinced that confusion and a growing sense of dread are sufficient to keep us riveted. We first meet Fassbenders character in bed where his sexual chemistry with soon-to-be-fiancee Laura (Penelope Cruz) is presumed reason enough to hope the couple lives to screw another day. Meanwhile everything else in the film points to just the opposite that this lawyer has already crossed a moral line sealing both of their fates -- and those of everyone else he touches -- in a kind of Faustian bargain. McCarthy unveils a splintered web of associates some direct some one or two degrees removed but all involved in what should have been a simple scheme to transform a few thousand dollars into 20 million by investing in a cocaine scam. Simple schemes have a way of getting awfully complicated when the screenwriter responsible decides to obfuscate the basics (drugs are stashed in a septic truck driven across the Tex-Mex border recovered in El Paso and then sent to Chicago to be sold on the streets) focusing instead on the ruthless obstacles that lie in his characters path. The counselor -- whom McCarthy never gives a proper name nor a proper personality -- merely wants to settle his debts then settle down with Laura. This much we know about him Hes devilishly handsome 100% devoted and dangerously naive getting mixed up with all manner of psychos without suspecting that those relationships might come back to haunt him. Can he trust pretty-boy middleman Westray  (Brad Pitt effectively playing the grown-up sobered-up version of his ""True Romance"" stoner-philosopher)? And what about Reiner (Javier Bardem) who runs a nightclub business as a half-assed front for his shadier dealings? Having previously played McCarthys most iconic character the cattle gun-toting hitman Anton Chigurh Bardem tackles a more flamboyant role here as this Versace-wearing cross between coked-up Robert Downey Jr. and spastic Christopher Walken. Though everything here serves to echo the for-shame philosophical monologue at the end of ""No Country for Old Men"" -- in which crime has grown crueler impervious to any law on earth or in heaven -- the entire story serves to illustrate the inexorable consequences of casting ones lot with those who have no respect for life. Its written as tragedy but enacted with such cold indifference that one is left reeling from the experience which Scott has directed elegantly enough to feel like a feature-length advert for the criminal lifestyle rather than a condemnation of same. Everyone in ""The Counselor"" comes decked out in designer clothes of some sort. For Fassbender and Cruz its Armani. Bardems flashiest accessory is his g.f. Malkina (Cameron Diaz) who sports a gold tooth silver fingernails and a full-back cheetah tattoo. Malkina may look like mere arm candy but shes not to be underestimated. In fact those who bother to unpack McCarthys unnecessarily obtuse script will find that shes actually the mastermind behind most of the mayhem in ""The Counselor"" -- a ruthless bitch whose veins no doubt course with liquid nitrogen. Malkina eavesdrops on Reiners conversations and discreetly calls the shots behind the scenes that result in several decapitations that grisly means of death favored by Mexican cartel capos. In an early scene Reiner happens to mention something called a ""bolito"" a mechanical device consisting of a loop of steel and a self-powered motor that tightens gradually until the unlucky wearer loses his head. As with Chekhovs gun one doesnt bring up such a weapon without intending to use it before the shows over. Although McCarthys script leaves so much else to the imagination it figures that Scott (who also brought us the sight of Anthony Hopkins serving brains from Ray Liottas open-capped cranium in ""Hannibal"") would insist on indulging such a spectacle. That as audiences have no doubt already heard is but one of several indelible images ""The Counselor"" bequeaths upon a public undeserving of such punishment. Sure to become the most notorious -- joining Sharon Stones ""Basic Instinct"" interrogation and the ""Wild Things"" pool scene in the pantheon of bad-movie golden moments -- is a sequence in which Diaz mounts the hood of Bardems yellow Ferrari complete with sound effects. With the exception of Bruno Ganz as an Amsterdam diamond dealer and ""Breaking Bads"" Dean Norris as an over-curious drug buyer none of the other actor-to-part pairings feel right in this film. (Such recognizable pros as Rosie Perez Edgar Ramirez and John Leguizamo uncredited all distract in roles better suited to unfamiliar faces.) But Diaz is by far the most committed to an impossible character wearing that same unnaturally menacing expression Kristin Scott Thomas did in ""Only God Forgives""earlier this year as if dying to acknowledge the roles camp potential. In helming Scott makes minimal use of music or flashy camerawork (two ways in which the film couldnt be less like a Tony Scott picture) content to let McCarthys words take the fore lest his own contributions distract. The script is nearly all dialogue including several eloquent spoken passages toward the end but its a lousy story ineptly constructed and rendered far too difficult to follow. The film doesnt end so much as stop. Some might argue that ""The Counselor"" demands a second viewing though the first is too unpleasant to recommend even in a so-bad-its-good context. The industry is too often intimidated by intellect and this project bears all the signs of perfectly smart talented people putting their faith in a rotten piece of material simply because it bore McCarthys name. When the dust settles heads are gonna roll and it wont be a pretty sight. Film Review The CounselorReviewed at Fox Studios Century City Calif. Oct. 22 2013. MPAA Rating R. Running time 113 MIN.

Whitney says November 12 2013 at 503 pm A+ on the jaw-dropping violence. C on the storyline. D on the ""what the hell does this have to do with anything"" scenes. Including what happens to dead bodies in septic containers stays in septic containers? Not exactly easy-to-follow. The story line was over done all over the place and should have had more scripted dialogue. Another odd Traffic Movie too many unnecessary stories combined into one major story. The Diaz car-sexing weird underlining women powerment message thing was too much and also uncomfortable lol. Also The grand poetic Big Cartel whom preaches on and on about justice fairness and life to the Counselor bull-shitingly saying to except his fluke fate. That scene pissed me off Oh god and that brutal strangle decapitating Pitt scene... Good lord. Its a so-so thriller that had me leaving feeling sad and confusingly morbid. Reply Nathan Jongewaard says November 8 2013 at 1228 am Not sure what movie this guy saw but Id count him wrong about everything. The Counselor is a gut punch of a thriller brilliantly written and directed vastly superior to the typical Hollywood BS in every conceivable way. That this critics response is typical of the films reception is the real head-scratcher. Reply gassa says November 10 2013 at 748 pm The Councelor is definately a D for me; disgusting dispicable depraved depressing. I was most disapointed that the potentially great cast would give this film content any oxygen. Just one more step down into desensitising the movie going public to violence cruelty and depravity Why? Am I the only one who wants to feel good positively influenced and entertained when I leave the theater. The scene when the big drug boss waxes all philisophical about HIS Justice amp; justification is a joke. This type of human lowlife only thinks about greed in every form amp; doesnt care who they hurt or destroy to get their pleasures. Im sure there are many good people from Mexico amp; Sth America. I recommend you dont go amp; support the studio amp; actors that produced this rubbish. Reply Nils Ohlanders says November 2 2013 at 902 am This makes me so angry ""audiences who wouldve happily settled for a more conventional genre movie"" Well I wouldnt have. Why would I want to see a normal boring movie. I held my breath all the way through this brilliantly constructed directed and played movie. Magical imagery wit and depth Reply T. Dorman says October 31 2013 at 708 am Does anyone who reads McCarthy really feel that Chigurh is more iconic than The Judge from Blood Meridian? Because Im pretty sure the answer is no. Reply Dan says October 31 2013 at 326 am Are you saying the film sucked like a Plecostomus? Reply David Bankston says October 27 2013 at 1226 pm Mr. Debruge you should refrain from commenting on that which is over your head. Reply G. Jardoness says October 27 2013 at 1229 am 1987 called it wants its Pepsi Commercial back. The most praise-worthy thing to say about this is its 25 million dollar budget... along with the timely reminder to change my windshield wiper-blades. Frankly Id rather see a relevant Ridley Scott rather than a once-visionary legendary director Ridley Scott whos seeming groping to reclaim some voice and identity as hes brought nothing to the myriad of genres and styles hes dabbled in in his attempt to be prolific having obviously lost the confidence to be masterful committed and unique. And the next time he pats himself on the back about having two films in the National Film Registry please tell him so is The Muppet Movie and The Nutty Professor. Reply Nousche says October 26 2013 at 237 am The casting the script the dialogs and the director are enough reasons to see this. Its very intriguing and captivating with great performances from all. The negative was the quick ending but you still leave the theatre impressed. For those who seek an atypical movie without predictable endings or actions give it a chance. You will love Reply Christopher Ferguson says October 25 2013 at 718 pm ""The script is nearly all dialogue including several eloquent spoken passages toward the end but its a lousy story ineptly constructed and rendered far too difficult to follow. The film doesnt end so much as stop"". Exactly its terrible. Honestly after Ridley cut this film and looked at it didnt he think it was a dog. How can an acclaimed director in Hollywood turn out this terrible directed jigsaw puzzle. Reply Bronco Pitt says October 24 2013 at 504 pm Is Bradley Mikael Douglas Pitt in this film? It looks good to me Tell Brad give me a nice 1911 .45 acp so I can shoot Ground Hogs on my property Tell him Uncle Bronco Pitt doesnt drive a FORD but would love to borrow his Bentley And.. Id like to meet his friend the Mac Damon and Matthew Broderick that Ferris Wheel kid/man This ""The Counselor"" looks mighty mean But it doesnt have EMMA STONE in it Reply immerstahl says October 24 2013 at 349 pm Hmm... so its pretty Shakespearean and not tied up in a bow... it sounds like a film for adults-full of abstraction and philosophy where everything isnt spelled out. Look this is Cormac McCarthy were talking about right? Of course the lead role has no name-thats a tried and true Western trope The Man With No Name. Symbolism that the film is a Western underneath it all. Thats precisely why it intrigues me. Reply LOL says October 24 2013 at 1257 pm Ridley Scotts brother Tony committed suicide while the director was making this movie. I am convinced such a tragic ordeal no doubt affected his vision and directorial thought-processes which materialised in an uneven picture. This may actually be a serious cult movie to be remembered. Lets cut Ridley some slack and be nice to him. Reply The Kingslayer says October 24 2013 at 1231 pm Ridley Scott just doesnt have it anymore. Reply Freddy with a d says October 24 2013 at 1154 am Immature miscreant posts abound. Go spend your cash and enjoy the garbage youve been warned about. Better choices remain. Reply Rick Strictland says October 24 2013 at 1024 am ""Cormac McCarthys first original script is nearly all dialogue but its a lousy story ineptly constructed and rendered far too difficult to follow."" I read the script and its brilliant. There is a great deal of dialogue but the dialogue is incredibly thoughtful and lyrical. If youre an unthinking person I can see you how youd find it unnecessarily obtuse but the more intelligent viewers will be saying thank goodness for a film that doesnt condescend and treat them like a child. Im not sure why youd think the story lousy given the fact its not only entirely realistic (people illegally getting involved with drugs for profit is not much of a stretch) but its current and based on what is a very unfortunate and dangerous situation across our own border. McCarthys works are some of the most thoughtfully constructed works of our age and this work is no different. The script I read was a masterwork but until the film is released for general viewing I cant fairly weigh in on how it was cut and thus its final construction. But that youd deduce McCarthy doesnt understand how suspense and drama work onscreen because he didnt follow convention is ridiculously presumptuous. For not treating ""audiences who wouldve happily settled for a more conventional genre movie"" like a bunch of elementary unthinking escapists he should be applauded. In my opinion its a welcome change that people watching a movie might have to actually - heaven forbid - think a little. Reply Peter Debruge says October 24 2013 at 533 pm Im encouraged by your optimism Rick. You describe precisely the hopes I had going in to the film. But alas the execution is almost in total opposition to the script (a moral play directed to look like a car commercial). Be sure to circle back after youve seen it and let me know if I sufficiently lowered your expectations to find something of merit in this morass. Reply caseyedwardsd says October 24 2013 at 1016 am It was well made and acted with commitment. Reply Jill says October 24 2013 at 849 am Im still going to see it. Id rather see an ambitious film that is flawed rather than one that aims for mediocrity and succeeds-as all too many do. Reply Doris Harper says October 24 2013 at 837 am This review is so unflatering and pompous just one mans point of view it has some very talented actors and actresses in it. That alone counts for something it means they have invested in this script. The mere fact you cut it down so much it inticed me to go and see it. Reply Johnnie says October 24 2013 at 1130 am Um yes this review is ""just one mans point of view"" Its the point of view of the critic. And you know what your opinion is one womans point of view yours. The writer never said he was speaking for everyone. And by the way how come when you hate a movie and tell all your friends you hated a movie thats okay. But when a professional writer says he hated a movie hes ""pompous""? Can you answer that for me? Reply kenmandu says October 24 2013 at 828 am No Country was way over-rated and the other two were flops... this review is no surprise.

It seems The Counselor is determined to find out. On the surface this new Ridley Scott thriller written by No Country for Old Men novelist Cormac McCarthy is a narrative wipeout a supposedly twisty-turny crime drama set along the border that isnt all that twisty or turny but is deeply convoluted and at times howlingly insane. But it knows it makes no sense. In fact it rubs our faces in it. The movie opens with the Counselor (Michael Fassbender) whose name we never learn and his lady love Laura (Penelope Cruz) in bed making love. ""Tell me something sexy"" he says. ""I want you to put your hands up my dress"" she whispers. ""But youre not wearing a dress."" ""What does that have to do with it?"" Their exchange shot in warm intimate close-ups feels both frivolous and portentous. After he does the deed she sighs ""Youve ruined me."" She doesnt know how right she is. At any rate a movie that begins with an extended sexual climax has got more than just Grishamite shenanigans on its mind. And boy does it. Nonsensical story lines arent always movie-killers. The Big Sleep is a masterpiece but neither director Howard Hawks nor author Raymond Chandler reportedly knew what the hell happened in it; the story took a backseat to the impressively hard-boiled dialogue to the smoldering chemistry between Bogart and Bacall. The Counselor cant come near such heights but its got something similar going on. Theres some kind of plot here about a drug deal gone wrong and a shipment gone missing but every scene turns on observations about life death women violence. The movie forsakes story; instead its all emotional through-line and color. A visit to an Amsterdam jeweler becomes a discourse on how we seek imperfections in diamonds as a way to ""announce to the darkness that we will not be diminished by the brevity of our lives."" When the Counselor meets with his partner in crime shady nightclub impresario Reiner (crazy hair aficionado Javier Bardem sporting a Brian Grazer do) the conversation veers toward women and about how ""you can do anything to them except bore them."" When our hero later meets with Westray (Brad Pitt) a middleman in the drug business they talk about how the world is all shit and the need to walk away from it. At one point Ruben Blades shows up to tell us that ""when you cease to exist the world that you have created will also cease to exist."" Its as if Cormac McCarthy isnt just the writer but hes cast himself in every part too. Actually that only applies to the men. The women are mostly saints or whores here. Laura is the good Catholic and angelic love object and that opening scene between Cruz and Fassbender places the movie in the right context. He is desperately foolishly hopelessly in love with her and everything he does is motivated by his all-consuming obsession to give her a good life. On the flipside weve got Malkina (Cameron Diaz) Reiners exotic scheming cheetah-obsessed mistress who lacks any sense of self-reflection or empathy. While Laura gets a loving intimate fingering from a very present Fassbender Malkina in one flashback that well all be talking about for years fucks a car as Bardem watches. (Im not making this up; its a scene you could insert into a South Park episode without any extra embellishments.) ""You see something like that it changes you"" Reiner says with a hint of disgust; nevertheless hes smitten too. Id probably be more troubled by the films treatment of women if it made any pretense to realism but these are clearly just opposing forces inside the writers head. And they have a certain power too. The film never loses focus on the Counselors love for Laura and that carries us well through the storys senseless byways and alleyways. So what the hell do we make of this movie? I worry that The Counselor is a monster that we created. By ""we"" I mean not just critics but all of us who ask that such movies be about more than just the ins and outs of their respective plots. How many times have I said things like ""The movie isnt really about [insert description of ostensible story line] but really about [insert grand philosophical subject here ... the way that men think of fear or love or yada yada yada]""? The Counselor calls our bluff and delivers the subtext on a blood-soaked star-studded platter. Still it shows us things -- obscene and hilarious yes but also just as often harrowing and unforgettable -- we never thought wed see. Its ridiculous but it has a ragged nobility all its own.

In Ridley Scotts ""The Counselor"" the premium is instead placed on style over substance and the result is a darkly tense drama that rarely hits anything resembling an emotional beat. At least its got major shock value to drive it and the only joy involved in the production seems to come care of its audiences half-giddy half-horrified desire to see what bonkers event is going to happen next. The films plot is relatively simple - Michael Fassbenders eponymous counselor gets willingly mixed up in a big drug deal with one of his (apparent) clients Reiner (Javier Bardem) and his ""business partner"" (Brad Pitt) a deal that falls apart in spectacular and brutal fashion thanks to a terribly strange coincidence that makes the trio look like self-serving rats to their counterparts across the border. Despite (or perhaps because of) its basic premise McCarthy tries to make everything appear far more convoluted to his audience. We enter the film after the biggest bits of the deal have been hammered out as the drugs are already been sent into America and yet everyone talks in large circles about whats at hand (thankfully Pitts Westray makes mention of Fassbenders investment early on clarifying a bit of the sense of ""what the hell is going on?"" that runs through the entire production). Cast here as an American lawyer (with an accent that jars throughout) Fassbender turns in the rare disappointing performance though most of the blame surely rests on a script that gives his character little to do beyond looking at turns totally cool and completely unhinged. Its a persistent problem in the film really as despite having a stacked cast of recognizable Hollywood talent at its disposal - Fassbender Bardem Pitt Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz - ""The Counselor"" doesnt require actual star power to deliver dazzling work simply because so many of its characters are kitted out with a bevy of weird personality traits and overwhelming costume hair and makeup choices that they would be remarkable enough even if an unknown played them. Surprisingly its Diazs character who is the most fascinating of the group but the actress frequently tone-deaf and hammy line delivery arent what make her Malkina stand out its the films weird combination of unbearably tense tone horrifying costume choices and one hell of a horrible haircut that drive her. Diaz however is admirably game when it comes to going whole hog on her character going so far as to engage in a jaw-dropping (and weirdly amusing) sex act with a car. That particular scene however is elevated to instant classic territory due to Bardems (who plays her whipped boyfriend in the film) absolutely perfect and very funny facial reactions (and his later musings on the event). ""The Counselor"" strange as it may be is worth the price of admission just to see whatever the hell it is that Bardem and Diaz are doing here as a decadently rich couple steeped in bad deeds and illegal acts. The pair are so wealthy in fact that when we first meet them they are watching their pet cheetahs (making ""The Counselor"" the most unexpected send up of ""Whos That Girl"" of the past decade) hunt jackrabbits across the open Texas plains clearly one of their favorite pastimes (and perhaps the most ""rich person"" pastime ever conceived of it makes croquet look positively gauche). Reiner and Malkina may be bonded by their love of money but trashy clothes over-the-top jewelry and staggeringly bad haircuts appear to keep them together on a daily basis. If anything ""The Counselor"" is good reminder that money cant buy taste nor can it provide solid follicle-based decision-making. When it comes to the rest of the cast Pitt proves to be reliably solid which is particularly interesting considering that hes clearly having a good time with his role. Cruz however does manage to inject her relatively small part with plenty of believable emotion made all the more striking when Fassbender tries to go for a similar angle later in the film and just manages to look uncharacteristically sloppy in doing so. The film is a deeply tense affair a tangible achievement considering just how obviously foreshadowed some of its most violent scenes are (and yes the film comes with plenty of bleak plain-faced violence). Scott and McCarthy are concerned with portraying the minutiae of processes over passing along vital information about bigger chunks of actual storyline but they have managed to make five minutes of a guy stringing wire across a quiet highway feel riveting enough to bolster the rest of the film. ""The Counselor"" is unfortunately permeated with a sickly sense of ""cool"" - cool sets cool places cool music cool people even the ""cool"" distance of only referring to its main character by his profession (and the films title) - that keep it from hitting any emotional and substantive high notes. McCarthy and Scott also riddle the film with one-off characters that pop up spout of a bunch of philosophical BS for whole minutes before disappearing back into the ether. The entire thing may speak of the meaningless violence of life (or at least lives dedicated to evil in its many forms) but that doesnt mean that the film itself must feel so terribly meaningless on its own.

Like Oliver Stones Savages this tony crime thriller exploits the brutality of the Central American drug trade for shock value but transpires mainly in the cool moneyed world of the callous rich. Because it was scripted by Cormac McCarthy the characters dispense studiously grim and cynical dialogue and because it was directed by Ridley Scott their inner lives matter less than their jewels designer clothing and fashionably spare living spaces.

TWITTER Michael Fassbender and Penelope Cruz lead an all-star cast for Cormac McCarthys screenwriting debut. Despite its scaldingly hot cast and formidable writer/director combination The Counselor is simply not a very likable or gratifying film. In fact its a bummer. Set mostly within a certain elite mostly American adjunct to the corrosive Mexican drug trade Cormac McCarthys first original screenplay features some trademark bizarre violence and puts some elevated and eloquent words into the mouths of some deeply disreputable figures. The main characters may be twisted but theyre not very interesting and crucially you can guess as well as dread whats coming from very early on. The stars exotic sex and creative violence will draw an audience looking for classy cheap thrills but widespread disappointment will yield less impressive box-office numbers than such an illustrious package would ideally generate at least domestically. A pretty tasty talk-and-sex scene played by Michael Fassbender and Penelope Cruz within a cocoon of white sheets gets things off to a good start but theres not much more where that came from in this sordid cautionary tale that warns that this is no country even for beautiful people. Its the sort of queasy yarn in which you just know that the love-struck exchange between Fassbenders Counselor and his beautiful sweetheart -- ""I want to love you until I die."" ""Me first."" -- will be turned from a beautiful sentiment into a doom-laden prediction with a short deadline. PHOTOS Ridley Scotts Life and Work Unlike No Country for Old Men the Coen brothers McCarthy adaptation that hit the cinematic jackpot artistically and commercially there are no cops or otherwise ordinary folks at the center of things here (except perhaps for Cruzs Laura who is not much seen). Instead theres a bunch of wealthy weirdos bright and colorful people who either never had or subsequently discarded the morality gene. Like the pet cheetahs so admired by Cameron Diazs elaborate and depraved Malkina who has tattooed her body with leopard-like spots these people live to hunt and hunt to kill. The Counselor who goes by no other name has clearly done very well over the years with his client Reiner (Javier Bardem) a spiky-haired big-spirited soul who enjoys a lavishly vulgar lifestyle with Malkina who sports a ring as big as a grapefruit and lives to push the sexual envelope. Her idea of a good time is to go to confession even though she isnt Catholic just to outrage the priest with details of her wild activities which might include an interlude we see of her doing the splits and gyrating on the windshield of Reiners Bentley while he watches from the seat; shes disappointed when he doesnt get turned on as he deems the display ""too gynecological to be sexy."" The Counselor drives a Bentley too (in fact the film is embarrassingly overloaded with high-end product placement) and he travels to Amsterdam just to buy Laura an expensive diamond ring so hes obviously doing just fine. However despite an explicit warning about the risks from Reiner the Counselor wants in on a very large upcoming drug deal probably imagining that hell retire from the game with Laura thereafter. Early on Reiner asks the Counselor if he knows what a bolito is then describes it as a wind-up wire device thats extremely effective at slicing peoples necks. You just know youre going to see this thing in action before its all over and its not the only wire-as-weapon McCarthy and Scott fetishistically employ in the numerous violent passages so much so that theres actually a character named Wireman. Also involved as some sort of middleman in the big deal going down is Westray (Brad Pitt) who even more explicitly than Reiner advises the Counselor not to get involved. Inadvertently however he gets sucked in when he does a favor on the outside for a hard-bitten prisoner (Rosie Perez very good). Just when it wasnt certain that McCarthys vision of the world could get much darker here he explicitly imperils his hero-by-default via the positive action of doing a good deed. Although this is not a mystery story per se in the end it really becomes an issue of whos going to be the last one standing. PHOTOS Outtakes From Michael Fassbenders THR Cover Shoot The trouble is its no fun -- not even dirty sordid delicious fun. This being a Ridley Scott film the images are always fabulous to behold (Dariusz Wolski who shot Prometheus and is now doing Exodus with the director was the luxuriant cinematographer) but here they are employed mainly to show off the lifestyle -- locations vehicles clothes jewelry makeup haircuts; its a like two-hour commercial for a no-limit credit card. The nominal lead is no more knowable than his name and theres little Fassbender can add to the character other than to become progressively more sweaty and desperate in the manner of so many old film noir heroes stuck in a spiders web. As far as dazzling villains are concerned the third time is not the charm for Bardem after his unforgettable turns in No Country for Old Men and Skyfall; Reiner seems only dissolute and beyond caring not ravenously evil his Brian Grazer-ish hair and loud wardrobe remaining his most defining emblems. Pitts ambiguous outsider who like the Counselor seems to be clearing an escape path for himself has a way with words thats passably entertaining while Diazs Malkina is like the Madonna or Lady Gaga of the criminal underworld an edge-pusher with a bent for calculated shocks a woman with a perennial advantage based on her no-rules mindset. What one is left with is a very bleak ending and an only slightly less depressing sense of the waste of a lot of fine talent both behind and in front of the camera.

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe Review The Counselor Hard-Boiled Hokum The world presented in Cormac McCarthys original screenplay (his first) is mind-numbingly portentous and brutal By Mary Pols MaryPolsOct. 24 2013 Share Read Later Send to Kindle Kerry Brown / Twentieth Century Fox Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture The portentous emotionally vacant film The Counselor directed by Ridley Scott plays like a parody of a Cormac McCarthy adaptation. Every gloomy and bloody outcome most taking place along the border between the U.S. and Mexico and all having to do with a drug deal gone bad is foretold. Every speech marks the cruel power of greed and condemns not just the weakness but the very smallness of mankind. Its derivative nonsense. The baffling thing is McCarthy did write The Counselor. Its his first original screenplay. The Counselor is not faux McCarthy; its just bad McCarthy. It begins with a couple in bed with their heads covered by the sheets they look like corpses in a morgue. They are Laura (Penelope Cruz) and the Counselor (Michael Fassbender) waking up after a long night of sex and preparing for more. Defying the laws of nature Cruz plays Laura as a woman so shy and modest that she has difficulty asking for what she wants during sex. Among the Madonnas and whores that populate the films landscape Laura is obviously the girl to marry. The Counselor (we never learn his name) repairs immediately to the office of a diamond dealer (Bruno Ganz) who shows him a large yellow diamond and ruminates on its hidden meanings ""At our noblest we announce to the darkness that we will not be diminished by the brevity of our lives."" Serious stuff. His word choice suggests that some brevity of life is in the works but if I were the Counselor Id ask if the conversation could be limited to cut color and cost. Instead he is rapt. Thats only the beginning. McCarthys screenplay has the Counselor absorb an extraordinary amount of hokum. Not only is he poised to get married; hes joining forces in a major drug deal with some of the criminals hes been successfully representing for years. Its the usual routine one heist and Im out. But everyone involved including his clients turned partners Reiner (Javier Bardem in his second McCarthy production after his Oscar-winning turn in No Country for Old Men) and Westray (Brad Pitt) would like him to know that Mexican drug cartels dont mess around. ""They will rip out your liver and eat it in front of your dog"" Westray warns. That may be true but when the Counselor eventually speaks with a kingpin named Jefe (Ruben Blades) there is nary a dog or a liver in sight just a load of new-age drivel. ""You are now at the crossing and you want to choose but there is no choosing"" Jefe tells the Counselor. ""You are the world you have created."" And also this ""Reflective men often find themselves at a certain remove from the realities of life."" Really the only satisfying conversations the Counselor ever has are with Laura ""Ooh. God. Yes. Yes."" The Counselor is such a passive sort and Fassbenders portrayal so fundamentally flat -- hes entirely miscast and has never been this blank or dull onscreen -- that it is never clear what has compelled the character into this foolish business. Is he arrogant stupid or insincere? Not that it much matters since the movies main purpose seems to be throwing up signposts for what lies ahead. If someone explains a new mechanism of killing or torture it is our dreary job as the audience to tick off the moments until that method is deployed. Usually it involves decapitation. This is a mystery without mysteries. Not surprising given that it is a Ridley Scott film. The Counselor looks as gorgeous as its cast with plenty of raking light across Southwestern landscapes. But for a movie thats meant to be contemporary -- at one point Fassbenders character stumbles into a street protest about all the disappeared young girls of Juarez -- theres an oddly retro vibe going on. Bardem could have been an extra from Less Than Zero while Cameron Diaz who plays Reiners girlfriend Malkina (her name might as well be Malevolent) slinks around in clothes and makeup out of a late-1980s Vogue shoot blathering about greed like Gordon Gekko when shes not demonstrating her rapacious sexual appetites. Malkina would be the whore to counter Cruzs Madonna and Diaz plays her to the sneering predictable hilt. Bathed in the kind of misogyny that seems like a tedious relic of the generation in which Scott now 75 and McCarthy 80 grew up its not a very intriguing role. I hope Im not being hopeful in calling it a relic. I also hope for the sake of Diazs dignity that she at least raised the question as she was filmed lewdly straddling a sports-car windshield whether any woman not on a porn payroll would seek or achieve pleasure in this way. At least the cheetahs hold on to their dignity. Reiner and Malkina keep a pair of them as pets presumably a signal of the couples self-indulgence and disregard for the natural order of things. The big cats spend the movie popping up in odd places (swimming pools piano benches) providing visual jokes in a generally humorless film. In lieu of any humans to care about I found myself fixating on the animals health and well-being. If the ominously described bolito -- sort of a hands-free head-removing device which dont worry youll see in action -- had been employed on a cheetah Id have been upset. Instead I took my cue from the cheetah that walks by a fresh and bloody corpse takes a cursory sniff and lifts its baleful eyes to look ahead. He or she is at a crossing and wait there is choosing. Namely moving on and leaving all the dumb pretty men of The Counselor behind. Mary Pols MaryPols Mary Pols has been reviewing film and occasionally books for TIME since 2009.

Share Tweet Early into The Counselor a merciless desert noir about crime not paying and best-laid plans going astray an eccentric kingpin (Javier Bardem) tells his new accomplice the titular lawyer (Michael Fassbender) about a weapon being used by the drug cartels. A kind of portable guillotine the device clamps around a victims neck a strand of unbreakable alloy tightening like a boa constrictor second by second until the head pops clean off the body. For viewers this charming anecdote should make a couple things clear First that theyll eventually get to see this instrument of doom in action as gruesome proof of Chekhovs theory about guns introduced in the first act; and second that theyre watching the work of the same unforgiving storyteller who turned a captive bolt pistol into Anton Chigurhs trustiest tool. The ingenious new killing machine is basically a mechanized noose which makes it a fine metaphor for the whole movie--a thriller that coils around the neck of its protagonist a slick but naive attorney undone by his involvement in an ill-fated smuggling operation. The screenplay of The Counselor was written by revered novelist Cormac McCarthy whose fingerprints are all over it. Like many of his books its set near the U.S.-Mexican border and features drug deals gone awry greedy men in over their heads and a plot that might best be described as existential Elmore Leonard. There are numerous echoes of No Country For Old Men including Bardem in a silly haircut but also a crucial difference between the two That earlier work so masterfully (and faithfully) brought to the screen by the Coen Brothers conveyed McCarthys pessimistic worldview almost exclusively through the architecture of its story particularly its devastating anticlimax. The Counselor on the other hand puts all its big ideas right into the mouths of its actors Long stretches of the film consist of nothing but florid conversation as characters bounce philosophical musings off of each other turning even the gravest encounter--for example two meetings with a pragmatic middle man played by Brad Pitt--into overwritten gab sessions. Opinions will vary on whether lines like ""Truth has no temperature"" are clever but its hard to deny that The Counselor might have benefited from a sparer less talkative approach. As in last years similarly fatalistic Killing Them Softly the pretensions of profundity sometimes muddy what is at its core a mercenary genre piece. Ushering McCarthys bleak vision to the screen is Ridley Scott who once toyed with adapting the writers viciously violent oater Blood Meridian. Never the most sentimental of filmmakers Thelma amp; Louise excepted Scott is a fine fit for this tale of cutthroat backdoor business. The film looks spectacular even as it basically swipes its color palette from No Country and Scott stages the violence--a doomed getaway attempt brutal highway fatalities--with his usual icy technical proficiency. No amount of needless chatter can quite dilute the power of The Counselors grim endgame especially given the way its writer and director conspire to keep the threat offscreen like some terrible unseen force of nature. Still it would have been nice if the movie didnt veer so dangerously close to outright misogyny. Besides the heros saintly damsel of a love interest (Penelope Cruz) the only other prominent female character is the vamping bisexual moll of Bardems businessman played by a severely miscast Cameron Diaz. Confirming all of her husbands fears about dating smart women she schemes wildly crashes a confession booth and--in a lurid flashback--makes love to the windshield of a car her sex pressed tight against the glass like ""a bottom-feeding catfish."" Maybe every noir needs a femme fatale but The Counselor needed this cartoonish variation about as much as its characters want fiber wires wrapped around their throats.
