Self-deprecation isnt simply his style; its part of his internal software - if he ever stopped acting like a wincingly sweet goody-two-shoes he might shut down completely. In Mickey Blue Eyes Grant plays Michael Felgate a Manhattan fine-art auctioneer who proposes to his sweetheart (Jeanne Tripplehorn) then discovers that shes the daughter of a Mafia chieftain (James Caan). Suddenly hes surrounded by oafish mobsters who all want favors from him. (In one of the few funny scenes he has to auction off a junior wiseguys painting of Jesus wreaking vengeance with a machine gun.) The supporting cast includes Burt Young (who looks like hes been on a diet of oat-bran cannoli) hamburger-faced Joe Viterelli and a bunch of other actors who have skulked whacked and bada-binged their way through these clicheacute; goombah roles so often they look about ready to open a theme restaurant (the Hard Case Cafe?). Its only when Michael has to impersonate a mobster himself that the movie lurches briefly to life. Pretending to throw a tantrum in a crowded restaurant Grant wraps his velvet diction and euphonious vowels around phrases like ""Get ouddaheah"" and its an altogether remarkable sound like hearing a Saville Row tailor trying to bark in Swedish. Acting like a tough guy - and failing at it miserably - is exactly the sort of thing Hugh Grant should be doing. It provides him with a hilarious way to deep-six his darling-masochist personality. But then having introduced an idea thats at least as funny as the depressed-hitman concept of ""Analyze This"" the movie mysteriously abandons it. ""Mickey Blue Eyes"" never lets Grant develop his pidgin-Italian nice-guy-gone-sociopath routine. Instead it chokes him off and were left with the same damned floppy-haired English gent drowning in tact.

Blue Eyes (unrated) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Blue Eyes (unrated) Hostilities bubble over in this intense airport drama. David Rasche and Cristina Lago in Olhos Azuis. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald8/12/2010 Editor rating 2.5 On his last day at work before mandatory retirement the bitter alcoholic Marshall (David Rasche) starts drinking on the job. He is the chief immigrations officer at JFK airport and his two co-workers (Frank Grillo and Erica Gimpel) are hoping hell pick them as his successor so they indulge him when he decides to randomly harass a group of Latin and South Americans entering the country. Among them are a Cuban ballet dancer an Argentine couple smuggling cocaine and Brazilian Nonato (Irandhir Santos) a legal U.S. resident returning from a visit with his daughter. Two thirds of Blue Eyes unfolds inside the Border Customs office at the airport where the guards become progressively bolder at humiliating the foreigners who dont understand why they are being retained. The more Marshall drinks the more his racism and hatred bubble to the surface eventually turning into violence. Director Jose Joffily allows the tension to mount gradually making us privy to the thoughts of the officers and travelers and exploring the mind set of foreigners in the post-9/11 era. But the airport stand-off scenes are all flashbacks. Blue Eyes continually cuts away to the present when a run-down Marshall dying of cancer seeks the help of a young prostitute (Cristina Lago) to track down Nonatos daughter. The split nature of the narrative defuses the suspense -- we know from the opening moments how this tragedy will end -- and the back and forth adds considerably to the running time which starts to feel mighty long. The airport sequences though would make a pretty good stage play. Cast David Rasche Frank Grillo Erica Gimpel Irandhir Santos. Cristina Lago. DirectorJose Joffily.

Well timed to arrive in the wake of his  110 million-and-counting ""Notting Hill"" the pic should hit a commercial bulls-eye. The latest entry in the pop culture arena to riff on the Mafia ""Mickey Blue Eyes"" is an engaging often very funny fish-out-of-water story that provides Hugh Grant with an excellent vehicle. Well timed to arrive in the wake of his  110 million-and-counting ""Notting Hill"" (and in advance of the bow of the second season of ""The Sopranos"") the pic should hit a commercial bulls-eye bolstering the actors resurgence and reminding Hollywood that it doesnt take Julia Roberts to make Grant appealing. As Michael Felgate a proper English auctioneer enamored of a schoolteacher (Jeanne Tripplehorn) who secretly happens to be a Mafia princess Grant makes the most of his awkward boyish slightly bumbling screen persona and deftly pulls off the verbal and physical comedy. While ""Mickey Blue Eyes"" doesnt mine the same psycho-comedic territory as ""The Sopranos"" or the recent ""Analyze This"" it likewise assumes audiences are familiar with the lexicon of Mafia lingo have seen the same dozen or so mob-related films and are collectively steeped in gangster mythology. (For example in one of Grants throwaway lines after having learned of his girlfriend Ginas family connections he reminds himself to ""rent Goodfellas Casino Godfather 1 2 3. "") That his prospective father-in-law Frank Vitale happens to be played by James Caan who memorably incarnated Sonny Corleone only adds to the winking mood. Setup is straightforward Michael proposes to Gina who terrified hell be sucked into the family business reluctantly refuses. When Michael learns that Ginas uncle Vito ""The Butcher"" Graziosi (Burt Young) runs more than a mere delicatessen he insists he is up to the challenge. But Vito has plans to implicate the auctioneer in a money-laundering scheme involving his sons atrocious surreal paintings (think Jesus with an Uzi). Before he can say ""fuhgeddaboudit"" Michael is up to his baby blues in falsehoods all the while trying to hide his business involvement from Gina for fear shell say she was right all along. That series of lies prompts massive misunderstandings suspicion of Michaels infidelity an inadvertent murder and a laceratingly funny attempt by Frank to pass Michael off to underworld associates as Little Big Mickey Blue Eyes from Kansas City. Frank tries to school Michael in mobster lingo only to hear him give a ridiculously British upper-class twist to classic wiseguy banter. One hilarious scene set in a steakhouse has Grant sounding like a cross between Tweety Bird and Madeline Kahns phonetically challenged diva from ""Blazing Saddles."" Grants part fits him like a custom-tailored Italian suit whether hes naively trading double entendres with Vito and Frank performing a desperate striptease to distract Gina or affecting the most unconvincing Mafioso airs. Caan is a fine foil as the wiseguy who wants his little girl to be happy and Young makes an impressively intimidating tight-lipped crime boss. Tripplehorn doesnt get to do much other than look dejected disapproving or disappointed until she performs some 11th-hour shenanigans that seem to have been designed to give her character a bit more credibility. Supporting players featuring many of the usual suspects from other mob films are thoroughly well cast. Though cliches abound in this pic as in any self-referential mob movie Adam Scheinman and Robert Kuhns script gives those conventions a comedic flair. Stowing a body in the back of a car for instance is a staple of any crime movie but when its a trunk already crammed with toasters Cuisinarts and assorted wedding gifts the juxtaposition is unexpectedly funny. Canuck helmer Kelly Makin keeps things moving which helps ensure that even familiar situations are never boring. Gregory Keens production design lends the Little Italy locations a warmth and an intimacy that lenser Donald Thorin captures with cozily lit style. Ellen Mirojnicks costumes are perfect at evoking character from the crisp button-down shirts Grant wears to the faintly tacky 70s-style sunglasses and wine-colored suits donned by Caan. Soundtrack featuring a number of well-chosen jazzy standards and ballads is a keeper.

Starring Hugh Grant Jeanne Tripplehorn and James Caan. Directed by Kelly Makin. (PG-13. 105 minutes.) ""Mickey Blue Eyes"" is a two- hour joke that falls flat. The premise sounds irresistible -- Hugh Grant as a bumbling adorable Englishman who gets involved with the Mafia in New York. But the resulting film is a sour misfire. Dont blame Grant -- except for making the picture in the first place. He should have run screaming. Grants charm is considerable but he cant make sirloin out of Spam. The picture stars Grant as Mi chael a boyishly charming auctioneer in Manhattan. Hes in love with Gina (Jeanne Tripplehorn) and shes in love with him but she wont marry him. Gina is a Mafia princess. James Caan an actor who is by now Italian by assimilation plays her father Frank a ""made guy."" Gina knows that if she marries Michael the Mafia will get its hooks into him. At this point ""Mickey Blue Eyes"" seems poised to go in one of two directions. It can play up the comic element by placing Grant in uncomfortable mob situations. Or it can turn downbeat and show the real consequences of having commerce with bad guys. Instead ""Mickey Blue Eyes"" takes an ambitious third course trying to blend the comedy and the drama and the attempt bombs badly. The movie concocts tensions between Michael and Gina that ring false and the plot complications are labored clumsy and unconvincing. ..

"Mickey Blue Eyes (PG-13) Related Item ""Mickey Blue Eyes"" showtimes An Offer Grant Should Have Refused By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday August 20 1999 The godfather-in-law Hugh Grant and James Caan get acquainted in ""Mickey Blue Eyes."" (Castle Rock) Director Kelly Makin Cast Hugh Grant; James Caan; Jeanne Tripplehorn; James Fox; Burt Young Running Time 1 hour 50 minutes Contains profanity and implied violence Hugh Grant should look back on 1999 as the year of ""Notting Hill"" the entertaining romantic comedy he starred in with Julia Roberts. He was charming affable and amusing. And the movie scored big at the box office. But he should consider hypnotic therapy to help him forget ""Mickey Blue Eyes"" a third-rate married-to-the-mob comedy. The story has Grant playing an art dealer in New York who falls in love with Gina (Jeanne Tripplehorn) who happens to be connected to the Mafia - or rather a Central Casting roll call of tired Italian American stereotypes. ""Mickey Blue Eyes"" was produced by Simian Films the production company headed by Grant and his girlfriend Elizabeth Hurley. The company name seems unfortunately apt since the movie makes a complete monkey out of Grant. As Michael Felgate hes an English cheap joke a prim polite cute and quippy lad who hems and haws his way through Little Italy. At least thats the ill-fated idea. Initially Michael has no idea about his girlfriends connections. So hes mystified when she rejects his marriage proposal for undisclosed reasons. She doesnt want to get him involved with her family but she cant tell him why. Hes so determined to win her heart however he decides to appeal to her father. He learns - little by little - that Pops is Frank Vitale (James Caan) a big-time mobster whos connected to the even scarier infamous Vito Graziosi (Burt Young). Frank is so touched by Michaels visit he all but finalizes the wedding. Of course this is the tie that binds. Its just a matter of time before Frank is asking Michael to do him you know a couple of favors. To cut short a lot of tiresome plot Michael (and his auction house) finds himself involuntarily sucked into the ugly business of extortion murder and money laundering. Hes also sucked into the even uglier business of forced comedy. Theres a whole routine in which Frank teaches Michael how to talk like a Goodfella. When Michael tries that all-important phrase ""Fuggedaboudit"" he sounds like Arnold Schwarzeneggers geeky brother. Its about as funny as digging your own grave in an unmarked part of New Jersey. As Michael gets more involved with his potential in-laws he tries to keep Gina in the dark which means the central romance - and any comic opportunity for romantic jousting - is gone. But then screenwriters Adam Scheinman and Robert Kuhn fare so badly with the Grant-Tripplehorn scenes this is probably just as well. When Michael proposes to Gina in a Chinese restaurant for instance he slips some money to the proprietor to make his proposal ""turn up"" inside a fortune cookie. Gina doesnt play along by opening her cookie. So the proprietor of the restaurant gets very belligerent and pushy until finally she yells expletives at the bewildered Gina. Meanwhile the cookie in question ends up at a different table. When the wrong woman opens it and says yes to her dinner partner shes immediately rejected because he had no intention of proposing. The scenes meant to be cute and funny but instead its rather nasty with a restaurant full of heartbreak ill will and outright cursing. And at that point the movies only just begun.

Self-deprecation isnt just his style; it...1999-09-03 C Mickey Blue Eyes Genre Comedy; Starring James Caan Hugh Grant Jeanne Tripplehorn; Director Kelly Makin; Author Robert Kuhn Adam Scheinman; MPAA Rating PG-13 Posted September 3 1999 -- 1200 AM EDT Hugh Grant is the first movie star to spend every moment hes on screen apologizing for being a movie star. Self-deprecation isnt just his style; its part of his internal software -- if he ever stopped acting like a wincingly polite Goody Two-shoes he might shut down completely. In Mickey Blue Eyes Grant plays Michael Felgate a Manhattan fine-art auctioneer who proposes to his sweetheart (Jeanne Tripplehorn) and discovers that shes the daughter of a Mafia chieftain (James Caan). Suddenly hes surrounded by oafish mobsters who all want favors from him. (In one of the few funny scenes he has to auction off a wiseguys painting of Jesus wreaking vengeance with a machine gun.) The supporting cast includes Burt Young (who looks like hes been on a diet of oat-bran cannoli) meatball-mugged Joe Viterelli and a bunch of other actors who have skulked whacked and bada-binged their way through these cliche goombah roles so often they look about ready to open a theme restaurant. Its only when Michael has to impersonate a mobster himself that the movie lurches briefly to life. Pretending to throw a tantrum in a crowded restaurant Grant wraps his velvet diction and euphonious vowels around phrases like ""Get oudda heah"" and its an altogether remarkable sound like hearing a Savile Row tailor trying to bark in Swedish. Acting like a tough guy -- and failing at it miserably -- is exactly the sort of thing Hugh Grant should be doing. It provides him with a hilarious way to ditch his darling-masochist personality. But then having introduced an idea thats at least as funny as the depressed-hitman concept of Analyze This the movie mysteriously abandons it. Mickey Blue Eyes never lets Grant develop his pidgin Italian nice-guy-gone-sociopath routine. Instead it chokes him off and were left with the same damned floppy-haired English gent drowning in tact.
