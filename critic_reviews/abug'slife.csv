The second computer-animated feature from the wizards at Pixar who made the great exhilarating ""Toy Story"" (1995) its a hellzapoppin creepy-crawly jamboree - a wryly teeming comedy set in a mad mad world of backyard bugs who have been brought to life with a technical ingenuity so extraordinary it may well transcend that of any previous animated film. Zip-zappy and supersmart crammed with busy caroming sight gags that escalate with a near-atomic frenzy A Bugs Life is like a fireworks show thats too big and bursting to take in. Its so obsessed with wowing you in every corner of every frame that as a movie it doesnt quite breathe. John Lasseter the creative guru of Pixar (and the films primary director) is undeniably some sort of whacked genius but you can feel how hard hes working to top himself and everyone else. He has made a kiddie flick thats about nothing so much as its own virtuosity - less an ingratiating entertainment than a crazily spinning gyroscopic feat. The animation from its opening frames is miraculous. Were near a tree trunk in the glorious sun where a friendly army of ants is placing seeds atop a giant rickety pile all as a ritual offering to a tribe of grasshopper bullies. Everything is gleaming yet tactile from the swaying grass blades to the insects faces and bodies which cast the subtlest of shadows and reflect slivers of light. The images have an eerie sculpted vitality that literally seduces your eye into forgetting its watching animation. For a while you revel in the textures and in the amiable tale of Flik (voiced by Dave Foley) the renegade-nerd hero who in his effort to invent a one-man-band grain-transport system accidentally spills the offering into a puddle. When the grasshoppers arrive led by the Darth Vaderish Hopper (voiced with implacable comic menace by Kevin Spacey) theyre hopping mad and Flik eager to save face volunteers to head off into the wilds round up some warrior bugs and bring them back to defend the colony. The best he can offer though is a motley troupe of flea-circus performers - a grouchy he-man ladybug (Denis Leary) a velvety black widow (Bonnie Hunt) a snooty stick bug (David Hyde Pierce) and an exuberantly squishy and corpulent German caterpillar (Joe Ranft). Its at the circus that the movie goes blissfully haywire as the gags explode with an intricate slapstick freneticism that walks a thin line between exuberant and exhausting. The staging while ingenious is often too fast for words - or pleasure. ""Toy Story"" had an inspired script but the wit in ""A Bugs Life"" is nearly all visual and though some of the jokes are great (a homeless bug brandishes the sign ""Kid pulled my wings off"") the insects as splendid and funny as they are to look at remain strangely one-note characters. The climax which hinges on the colonys construction of an elaborate fake bird to scare the grasshoppers is at once surreal and wobbly; that bird is beautiful but the story arc lacks thrust. The unhinged inventiveness of ""A Bugs Life"" is on some level awesome and I greatly enjoyed moments of the movie but it left me overall feeling slightly dazed. The film may just signal a new phenomenon imagination overkill.

Satiric surreal fun; Bad Teacher and star Diaz make no grade Watch a clip from the film ""Cars 2"" courtesy Walt Disney Pictures. By Joe Morgenstern June 24 2011 Five years ago when ""Cars"" proved to be Pixars first less-than-stellar animated feature an animator friend offered his theory about why. Cars he said can have faces but they dont have hands; theres only so much you can have them do. To make up for their lack of hands the cars in ""Cars 2"" do all sorts of cool things with their front tires and the 3-D animation as a whole is spectacular. But the movie has its own deficits--a lack of variety originality subtlety clarity and plain old charm. The law of averages has finally caught up with the most remarkable studio in modern movie history the dream factory that lived up to Buzz Lightyears joyous cry of ""To infinity and beyond."" This frenzied sequel seldom gets beyond mediocrity. ENLARGE Lightning McQueen and Tow Mater in Cars 2. Disney/Pixar Theres certainly no lack of clarity in the calculations behind Pixars swerve. In the five years since ""Cars"" was released the movie has sold something in the neighborhood of 10 billion in merchandise--cute little cars trucks and other vehicles that keep rolling off the toymakers assembly lines in epic numbers. To sustain such financial numbers--and to pave the way for next summers opening of a 12-acre Cars Land at Disneys California Adventure Park--Pixar and Disney the animation studios relatively new owner needed a hard-sell crowd-pleaser with exactly the sort of high-octane action and high-decibel soundtrack that energizes--or blights depending on your point of view--""Cars 2."" This is something new for Pixar a movie in which characterization and deep feelings take a back seat to breakneck pace and something new for Pixar lovers including me who may find themselves wondering if Disneys master merchandisers are starting to call the tune for Pixars master storytellers. The story here concerns a pair of American innocents abroad--Lightning McQueen the bright-red race car brightly voiced by Owen Wilson and Tow Mater the buck-toothed good-hearted tow truck who speaks in the cornpone tones of Larry the Cable Guy. Taking their leave of Radiator Springs the time-warpy desert town that served as the setting for ""Cars"" the two buddies head for Europe where Lightning enters the first of several competitions in the World Grand Prix and Mater is mistaken for a spy. The repetitive race sequences--vroom vroom vrooming at warp speed--are intercut with a James Bond spoof that centers on Finn McMissile a supercar with superweapons voiced by Michael Caine and that starts the action in a preface set on a giant oil platform at sea. (The preface to ""Toy Story 3"" which was absurdly and delightfully over the top turned out to be Andys fantasy. This one elaborate but clumsy is part of the narrative.) From one moment to the next ""Cars 2"" comes up with plenty of visual zingers a Parisian marche aux pieces (as in spare parts); a plunge into the giant clockworks of Londons Big Bentley; a Japanese toilet designed to pamper any chassis; exotic cars galore including such exotic lemons as the Pacer the Gremlin and what the movie calls the Hugo. And as cool as the story tends to be on a scale of emotional temperature it does evoke an affecting friendship between Lightning and Mater one thats tested by driving ambition and a deadly bomb. Still this is a Pixar animated feature were talking about a film from the people who brought genuine enchantment into our lives with tales of toys come alive of beguiling bugs fantastical fishies impassioned robots and self-reflective superheroes. Whats more its a film co-directed (with Brad Lewis) by John Lasseter the man who more than anyone else has embodied the studios spirit from the days when he used a computer to create a pioneering Pixar short about a couple of desk lamps. By now its a commonplace that Mr. Lasseter whose father was a parts-department manager in a Chevy dealership in Southern California was prompted to make the first ""Cars"" by profound car love. That film for all its odd mixture of tedium and frenzy operated within recognizable Pixar parameters. But in this one cars seem unconstrained by the laws of physics and writers seemed unconcerned with developing character as opposed to belaboring it. (Mater gets to be as maddening as that old Hollywood yodeler Andy Devine.) For Pixars sake and for ours lets hope that the fast track of ""Cars 2"" is a temporary detour. Watch a clip from the film ""The Names of Love"" courtesy Music Box Films. ENLARGE Sara Forestier and Jacques Gamblin in The Names of Love. Music Box Films The Names of Love ""Our two families embody France"" says Baya Benmahmoud the delightful heroine of Michel Leclercs sharp-witted sometimes surreal and largely autobiographical French-language comedy which he directed from a script he wrote with Baya Kasmi. So they do in many ways though not necessarily in the amorous way one might infer from the misleading English title. Baya who is played by Sara Forestier has an earnest Algerian father and a screwy French mother. The filmmakers surrogate Arthur Martin (Jacques Gamblin) has a Jewish mother of immigrant parents and a father who served in the Algerian war. The political intricacies on both sides are too complex to detail here while the comedy flows with daunting fluency from the ostensibly mismatched lovers. Baya a sentimental left-winger who is as volatile as she is alluring sleeps with conservatives in order to convert them; she considers her body a weapon with which to destroy the right wing. Arthur a middle-age middle-of-the-roader studies bird flu as a scientist; at one point he cant sleep with Baya because he must perform a necropsy on suspect geese. ""The Names of Love"" isnt a completely misleading title since love along with lovemaking does prevail. Still the original title ""Le Nom des Gens""--literally ""Peoples Names""--comes much closer to conveying the storys essence. Mr. Leclercs movie in French with good English subtitles often plays like romantic comedy but its really a sophisticated burlesque about the significance of surnames (his is comically common hers misleads people into thinking shes Brazilian) plus some quintessentially French obsessions the trap of racial identity; the politics of ethnicity and the fateful power of the past populated as it is for Baya and Arthur by ancestors who suffered for them dreamed for them and loved them. ENLARGE Cameron Diaz in Bad Teacher. Columbia Pictures Watch a clip from ""Bad Teacher"" starring Cameron Diaz Justin Timberlake and Jason Segel. Bad Teacher From the evidence on screen no one who made this alleged comedy ever noticed that no one in it was remotely likable. The heroine Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) has been teaching at a middle school to kill time until her impending marriage to a rich guy. Her academic qualifications are never in evidence but she is manifestly a lazy cynical oversexed unprincipled foul-mouthed pot-puffing booze-slugging gold-digging slut who is not only dislikable but unfunny. Then her marriage plans go awry and her flaws multiply. Have talented actors ever struggled so much to so little avail? Ms. Diaz sells her lines like a street vendor peddling fake Timexes. Lucy Punch mugs and pouts as Elizabeths rival Amy Squirrel. Justin Timberlake plays the creepily fey Scott Delacorte a rich substitute teacher who sings a ghastly song called ""Simpatico."" (""Ask me how much I love you. A lottico."") Only Jason Segel finds a few fugitive flashes of likability--yes Im backtracking a bit here--as a gym teacher named Russell Gettis. (Lots more gravitas in that name than in Squirrel.) How did ""Bad Teacher"" which was directed by Jake Kasdan come into being? Maybe someone having seen Jack Black in ""The School of Rock"" decided to do something even raunchier with a female teacher (and failed to notice that both the star and his material were terrifically funny.) Or maybe the production began--as it should have ended--with the clever risque poster that shows among other things Ms. Diaz with her booted feet on a teachers desk. How much do I loathe this film? A lottico is putting it mildico. DVD FOCUS A Bugs Life (1998) The second Pixar feature this animated fable teems with vivid creatures standing on their own countless feet. The ant hero Flik (Dave Foley) wants to throw off the tyranny of the grasshoppers who led by the malevolent Hopper (Kevin Spacey) demand a huge cut of every harvest. Journeying forth to the big city in search of help Flik mistakes the members of a broken-down flea circus for puissant warriors brings them back home and presents them as the colonys saviors. The clowns redeem themselves but only by helping fearful antdom find the courage to get real and hang tough. Amelie (2001) Jean-Pierre Jeunets French-language fable isnt about racial identity or any of the other preoccupations of ""The Names of Love."" As a stylistic tour de force though it has been hugely influential on many filmmakers of varied ethnicities. First the film conjures up a telepathic but touchingly fragile heroine played by Audrey Tautou who rearranges other peoples lives even though shes terrified to live her own. Then the movie puts this elfin do-gooder/do-badder at the center of a fanciful world that looks like everyones idealized notion of Paris no crowds no dirt no traffic no permanent grief. Any Given Sunday (1999) Thinking about Cameron Diaz may not put you in mind of Oliver Stones movie about human worth vs. net worth but its entertaining all the same. Al Pacino is an aging coach who still thinks the game should be fun. Ms. Diaz is Christina Pagniacci a steely young franchise owner and Jamie Foxx is Willie Beamen a headstrong quarterback who brings Christinas team a star quality that she covets. If the field is tilted toward traditional values thats the fun of this fantasy version of the NFL in which morality finally proves a smoother lubricant than corporate moolah.

With the voices of Dave Foley Kevin Spacey Julia Louis-Drefus Hayden Panettiere Phyllis Dyler Richard Kind David Hyde Pierce Joe Ranft Denis Leary. Directed by John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton. (G. 94 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Give it six thumbs up and a crawling ovation ""A Bugs Life"" is one of the great movies -- a triumph of storytelling and character development and a whole new ballgame for computer animation. Pixar Animation Studios has raised the genre to an astonishing new level. This warm rollicking movie features a computer-created world that looks breathtakingly natural with wonderfully realized organic textures depth of field shadings and an amusing bugs-eye point of view. It all adds up to a terrific entertainment for kids that doesnt talk down to adults either. The main character Flik (voice of ""NewsRadios"" Dave Foley) is a young freethinker in a closed society an ant colony on a tiny island. Each harvest time a gang of bullying grasshoppers led by the swaggering Hopper (Kevin Spacey) extorts food from the ant colony. Its a flipped-over variation of the Aesop fable ""The Grasshopper and the Ant."" The grasshoppers are like the bikers in ""The Wild One."" When Hopper snarls ""Lets fly"" the grasshoppers rev up and become a roaring crowd of Harley gangsters. Its a riotous conceit. Other key ant characters are pert Princess Atta (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) a button-cute Princess Dot (Hayden Panettiere) and the Queen (Phyllis Diller) always clutching her lap pet a green aphid. The ants have two legs and two arms with three fingers. And adorable faces. Flik is a well-meaning nerd a gadgeteer. When one of his harvesting contraptions goes awry and destroys the food intended for the grasshoppers all heck breaks out. Hopper demands a second offering of food ""by the time the last leaf"" of autumn falls. The colony exhausted panics. Flik says hell venture to the outside world for help a scheme the colonists agree to as a way of banishing him. In a spectacular aerial sequence Flik plucks a dandelion spore and floats into the great unknown though its only a dry little creekbed in human terms. In a somewhat jarring shift the story then turns to a troupe of artistes in a flea circus. More wonderful characters are introduced -- Slim (David Hyde Pierce) is a stick bug Heimlich (Pixars Joe Ranft) a chubby caterpillar clown Francis (Denis Leary) a guy lady bug with attitude Manny (Jonathan Harris) a mantis Gypsy (Madeline Kahn) a moth and Rosie (Bonnie Hunt) is a black widow with a heart of gold. Also in the flea circus are a funny nonsense-speaking pair of Hungarian pill bug acrobats (voiced by Michael McShane) not to mention circus leader P.T. Flea (John Ratzenberger). What ""A Bugs Life"" does with this troupe is inspired. The actors are thrown out of work by a circus mishap and Flik mistakes them for a band of mercenary warriors. They in turn believe that Flik is hiring them to put on a show. The greatest menace to the bug realm is a groundling sparrow that looms like a monster. The Pixar artists made the bird move much faster than the average movie monster and its a brilliant stroke. Another visual highlight is Fliks arrival in a Manhattanlike city that when the camera draws back is nothing more than a fly- infested trash dump outside a trailer park. Crowd scenes with big-eyed ants are pure magic. The film is filled with so many sight and verbal gags it calls for repeat viewing to catch all the details. But the movie also plays like an epic set in a Wild West landscape an atmosphere smartly enhanced by Randy Newmans Coplandesque score. Also audiences get treated to Oscar-winning ""Geris Game"" by Pixars Jan Pinkava as an opening short. And whatever you do dont leave the theater until the lights come on -- ""A Bugs Life"" has some of the funniest end-credit outtakes ever.

A Bugs Life Movie Review amp; Film Summary (1998) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/a-bugs-life-1998,200,abug'slife8,abug'slife,rogerebert
"A Bugs Life (G) Related Items ""A Bugs Life"" showtimes Click here to view the trailer Something Pesky About A Bugs Life By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Wednesday November 25 1998 Disneys latest computer-animated release is ""A Bugs Life."" (Disney) Directors John Lasseter; Andrew Stanton Cast Dave Foley; Kevin Spacey; Julia Louis-Dreyfuss; Phyllis Diller; Bonnie Hunt; David Hyde Pierce; Madeline Kahn; Denis Leary; Roddy McDowall; John Ratzenberger Running Time 1 hour 34 minutes A few ""Im scareds"" were heard in the audience You know that feeling? Youre lying there at night trying to get to sleep and you feel these . . . tiny little feet . . . six of them . . . lightly scuttling across your body and you go Whatthehellisthat jumping like youre shot out of a cannon scratching frantically even in midair before heading toward the shower to soak under a scouring blast of 145-degree water. You know that feeling? Well get used to it because ""A Bugs Life"" produces that feeling as if amplified by 300-watt speakers. Ewwww bugs. The film comes from Disney via the miracle process known as computer generation which is not as roly-poly and weightless as conventional animation but not as clumsy gross and difficult to manage as reality. ""Toy Story"" was the best feature done this way but then until ""A Bugs Life"" it was the only feature done this way. Its still the best feature done this way. Computer generation mostly used in Eyewitness News logos creates a strange near-reality the illusion of depth space weight movement detail but all in stylized forms that seem closer to artistic than to realistic. Somehow you know that youre looking at a thing that doesnt exist except as coded blips on someones hard drive. Technically ""A Bugs Life"" takes this process and really wrings it out. The film is a festival of tiny brilliances creatures of amazing construction and agility that quiver to life perspectives of the world at the grass level that are truly awesome suggesting Heaven in a very small space and still trickier gimcracks like water droplets the size of globes that quiver as they diffuse the light passing through them. But a lot of this is simple showing off that somehow doesnt add up to a brilliant movie. For one thing the process itself is subtly dislocating just riding the I-dont-believe-it line. Possibly kids whove spent the hours they should have been reading actual books in front of a video game will have less difficulty with it than I did. Still I felt more that I was looking at a sample reel than in the presence of an actual story. Clever as it is the film lacks charm. One problem too many bugs. Second bigger world for two purposes to feed birds and to irk humans. The plot seems extremely familiar based as it is on ""The Seven Samurai"" by way of ""The Magnificent Seven"" as further evolved in a popular comedy. I can almost see see the pitch meeting ""Michael youre gonna love this We remake The Three Caballeros only with ants"" Nasty grasshoppers are intimidating the docile ants of Ant Island robbing them each spring of the majority of their grain harvest. The ants it would seem are defenseless especially since in the interests of political correctness soldier ants have been demobbed and sent away perhaps to await a remake of ""Them"" What remains are pacifists and cowards and whiners so that when the grasshoppers arrive the ants simply run around screaming. The grasshoppers - fearsomely fronted by Hopper a large beast represented by Kevin Spaceys oily voice - demand their tribute; alas the dreamer ant Flik has spilled it all into a mudhole. The hoppers give the ants the rest of the summer to come up with the spores and seeds that will get them through the winter. So Flik goes off in search of warriors to protect them. Toshiro Mifune Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen being dead and Martin Short being on Broadway he manages to mistake a few bugs in a flea circus for fighters and he hires them. For their part they think theyre being offered a gig. ""Toy Story"" had the advantage of a more vigorous story line and two strong vocal talents in the lead roles Tom Hanks and Tim Allen. No voice in particular dominates ""A Bugs Life"" with the exception of Spaceys. Dave Foley who sounds the notes of hero ant Flik makes almost no impression at all. He could be any morning deejay between here and Minsk. None of the other performers makes an impression including the normally vivid Julia Louis-Dreyfus in the role of the bland princess Atta. Another miscalculation that distances the viewer from the film is possibly ontological It has to do with the metaphorical meaning of ants. Traditionally ants are used symbolically as images of a totalitarian organization of society. These guys - co-directors John Lasseter (who won an Oscar for ""Toy Story"") and Andrew Stanton (who wrote it) - see ant society as a kind of merrily dysfunctional matriarchal utopia where everybody knows and loves his place. All in all ""A Bugs Life"" is pretty much for the birds.

""A Bugs Life"" opens this week against Paramounts new animated film ""Rug Rats"" and next week ""Babe Pig In The City"" opens as Universal Studios entry into the race for holiday family viewing. ""A Bugs Life"" joins ""Antz"" as the second bug-involved movie to sit down at the box-office picnic table this fall. ""Antz"" is more adult in its sensibilities and is the best Woody Allen film in years. But ""A Bugs Life"" is broader in its appeal and is truly aimed at the whole family. Pauls Pix ""A Bugs Life"" Windows Media 28k or 56k Real 28k or 56k Theatrical preview for ""A Bugs Life"" Windows Media 28k or 56k Real 28k or 56k As with ""Antz"" in ""A Bugs Life"" we have an individual ant this time named Flik and voiced by Dave Foley who takes it upon himself to save his entire ant colony. The enemy in this film is a gang of nasty grasshoppers led by the very menacing Hopper played by Kevin Spacey who extort food from the ants in return for protection. All-star cast Julia Louis-Dreyfus makes a post-""Seinfeld"" appearance as the voice of Princess Atta who of course falls in love with our hero. Phyllis Diller plays her mother the Queen ant who is hoping to retire soon and turn the colony over to Atta. Richard Kind (best known for his role on the TV show ""Mad About You"") is wonderful as the grasshopper Molt the villainous Hoppers loser brother. There is also a great appearance by ""Frasier""s David Hyde Pierce who lends his voice to the character of Slim. Slim is a very intellectual and rather snobby walking stick bug who takes himself very very seriously. Dennis Learys gravelly voice is perfect for Francis a male ladybug suffering from a gender crisis. And finally we have the late Roddy McDowall in his last role as Mr. Soil a pompous ant who serves on the colonys ruling council. Taking the dual themes of ""individuals can make a difference"" and ""it takes teamwork to make great things happen"" ""A Bugs Life"" is a wonderful achievement both in its charming story and its brilliant computer animation. Perfect movie for holidays Screenwriters Donald McEnery and Bob Shaw both come from a background of stand-up comedy and it shows in their very witty -- and at time outrageous -- script. The animation is by Pixar the same people who brought us ""Toy Story"" in 1995 and the director is Academy Award winner John Lasseter who also co-directed ""Toy Story."" ""A Bugs Life"" is a perfect movie for the holidays. It contains a great upbeat message ... its wonderful to look at ... its wildly inventive ... and its entertaining for both adults and kids. If you go to see ""A Bugs Life"" dont bolt for the parking lot as soon as The End appears on the screen. Sit back and enjoy the most innovative closing credits in years. Youre in for a surprising treat. There is also a very hummable score by Randy Newman. Newman is a 10-time Oscar nominee for his film scores -- including his nomination for ""Youve Got A Friend in Me"" from ""Toy Story."" Put away the Raid -- ""A Bugs Life"" is going to be a big hit. If this movie doesnt make you smile you may not know how. ""A Bugs Life"" which opens on November 25 is rated ""G"" with a running time of 94 minutes.

"Bugs Life A | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; bug-s-life-a ) Bugs Life A (United States 1998) A movie review by James Berardinelli Its almost a shame that A Bugs Life is debuting so close in the wake of Antz (although to be fair the latter film was the first to enter production). No matter when the Pixar/Disney production reached theaters comparisons between the two computer-animated insect movies would be inevitable but with only seven weeks separating their openings those comparisons will be more intense. Fortunately A Bugs Life can withstand the scrutiny. Despite a number of similarities to Antz there are enough variations in plot and tone to warrant another visit to the unique and wondrous world existing beneath the blades of grass. In A Bugs Life the protagonist is Flik (voice of Dave Foley) an ant whose sole desire in life is ""to make a difference."" Flik is an inventor and when one of his experiments goes wrong it brings the wrath of the grasshoppers led by the dangerous Hopper (Kevin Spacey) down upon the denizens of the ant hill. To protect the community Flik with the blessing of the ant queen (Phyllis Diller) and Princess Atta (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) ventures into the outside world and recruits ""warrior insects"" to defend the colony. The group of nine he collects is comprised of a praying mantis (Jonathan Harris Mr. Smith from the TV version of ""Lost in Space"") a butterfly (Madeline Kahn) a black widow spider (Bonnie Hunt) an unladylike ladybug (Denis Leary in a scene-stealing vocal performance) a walking stick (David Hyde Pierce from TVs ""Frasier"") a caterpillar with a German accent (Joe Ranft) a rhino beetle (Brad Garrett) and a pair of unintelligible pillbugs (Michael McShane). There is a mistake in identity however. Fliks ""warrior bugs"" are actually circus insects and they accompany him under the false assumption that he is a talent scout. Things start to unravel once the ant and his elite corps discover the truth about each other. In a head-to-head comparison its easy to make an argument for either Antz or A Bugs Life as the best entry in almost every category that the two share. Antz contains somewhat more mature content; A Bugs Life is designed a little more with kids in mind. However as is true of Antz the story presented in A Bugs Life works well on two levels. Children will appreciate the likable characters and fast-paced adventure; adults will marvel at the skillful animation and subtle humor. For ""star power"" Antz undeniably comes out on top with instantly-recognizable names like Woody Allen Sylvester Stallone Sharon Stone and Gene Hackman (as opposed to David Foley Denis Leary Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Kevin Spacey). But its important to note that immediate voice recognition doesnt necessarily add anything to a performance (although admittedly its fun to hear the banter between Allen and Stallone). The vocal acting in A Bugs Life is no less accomplished or effective than that in Antz. Visually the films are both brilliantly detailed and wonderfully textured. A Bugs Life gives new dimensions to the diminutive world - a place where raindrops are dangerous projectiles single berries provide full meals and the most feared enemy is a bird. And while most of Antz relies on earthy tones A Bugs Life explodes with a cacophony of color. Of the three computer-animated feature length films to reach the screen thus far this is the most dazzling. One thing A Bugs Life has that Antz does not is a ingenious series of end credits. Instead of just the latest lame Randy Newman song warbling over scrolling names we are presented with a collection of mocked-up outtakes that parody the kinds of flubs and goofs which have come to decorate the credits of numerous comedies. Its brilliant in both conception and execution and one could make a solid case that the last three minutes of A Bugs Life are its best. I wouldnt go that far but this is definitely a movie when its a good idea not to run for the exit as soon as the story ends. Pixar is the studio that first brought a full-length computer-generated feature to the screen with 1995s Toy Story and by adding A Bugs Life to their resume they have established themselves as a force to be reckoned with not only in the realm of animated films but in that of family entertainment in general. (Disney must be delighted to be in partnership with them.) Co-directors John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton understand that every story even one with such an intense focus on visual elements begins with a script and characters. A Bugs Life like Toy Story develops protagonists we can root for and places them in the midst of a fast-moving energetic adventure. And while Antz and A Bugs Life each work well enough on their own they are best when seen in concert if only to compare and contrast the fine craft evident in such top-notch examples of family entertainment.

Entertaining in a very showbizzy way ""A Bugs Life"" reps the second good computer animated ant adventure in as many months. More broad based and kid friendly than DreamWorks somewhat more sophisticated ""Antz"" John Lasseters second film wont reach the exalted B.O. levels of his 1995 ""Toy Story"" the first computer animated feature. Its imaginative design and spirited storytelling will however make it a must-see for family audiences and Disneys big holiday bugfest should ultimately enjoy the equivalent commercial relationship with the surprisingly durable ""Antz"" that its summer blockbuster ""Armageddon"" did with DreamWorks/Pars ""Deep Impact."" It will do significantly more business but perhaps a tad less than it might have had the earlier release not existed. Lasseter and Pixar broke new technical and aesthetic ground in the animation field with ""Toy Story"" which raked in 360 million worldwide and here they surpass it in both scope and complexity of movement while telling a story that overlaps ""Antz"" in numerous ways even if the brassy tone is thoroughly different. Both films center upon an ineffectual misfit character whos out of step with the uniformity of ant society; both involve an above-ground odyssey by this character into unknown territory as well as a struggle with large hostile insects as part of an effort to save the colony. But the differences are even more immediately apparent. Presented in CinemaScope ""A Bugs Life"" bursts upon the screen with beautiful verdant hues as a legion of ants laboriously transports pieces of food up to await the arrival of their terrorizers a gang of grasshoppers. Unfortunately the hapless Flik who fancies himself a brilliant inventor knocks over the offering and when the ants swaggering enemies turn up to find nothing to eat their big bully chief Hopper gravely threatens the little ones existence unless they double their donation by the end of the season. Both obliged to and disenfranchised from his community Flik exiles himself in a search for anyone who might help his brethren out of their jam. Instead of seven samurai however all he can find are the eccentric members of a rag-tag flea circus individuals who are much more inclined to put on a show at the drop of a hat than to take on a bunch of giant flying bugs. Its when these uniformly colorful characters start strutting their stuff that Flik and the rest of the ants are shown up as the pallid little creatures that they are. Flik is just as nebbishy and forlorn as the figure voiced by Woody Allen in ""Antz"" but isnt nearly so outspokenly individualistic or irreverent. Actually hes a well-meaning dullard and the ant characters in general here are much less interestingly individuated than they are in ""Antz."" Its a fortunate thing then that scenarists Andrew Stanton Donald McEnery and Bob Shaw have surrounded Flik with so many lively critters both friendly and not. First encountered in a makeshift arena in a sort of insect Coney Island P.T. Fleas circus counts among its numbers a male ladybug obsessed with asserting his virility a proud old praying mantis a somewhat bashful rhino beetle a generous moth named Gypsy a walking stick with highbrow airs a humorous German caterpillar an unusually friendly black widow spider and twin Hungarian pillbugs who are always ""on."" Safely transported back to the ants compound without a clue as to how his new friends will help defend against the marauders Flik is inspired by a scary encounter with an aggressive orange bird to construct a mechanical bird that will scare off the grasshoppers. Happily this creation represents nowhere near the be-all and end-all of the climax which involves a lengthy confrontation with Hopper who food or no food wants to make sure that the ants are kept in their place. At 96 minutes story plays out at slight overlength. But Lasseter and his imaginative team keep the senses stimulated most of the time with boisterous action tasty character turns by some of the supporting players and above all gorgeous visuals that reveal new levels of detailing and coloration in computer animation. Whereas ""Toy Story"" was an indoor film ""A Bugs Life"" is set mostly outside and the landscapes and evocations of plant life are illustrated with colors that are bold and beautiful but never gaudy; overall look is crisp clean and invariably pretty. The effects of wind weather and movement are more precise than before and while the number of individually rendered players is impressive ""Antz"" has the edge when it comes to sheer spectacle. Performances across the board are spirited but a handful stand out. Jonathan Harris voicing the vain and aging praying mantis is superbly droll in lending life to an old school performer overly devoted to recalling the greatness of the good old days. Bonnie Hunt as the spider Denis Leary as the misperceived ladybug and Joe Ranft as the Teutonic caterpillar all have their moments. But the stellar turn in the juiciest role comes from Kevin Spacey as the grasshopper ringleader; thesps delivery oozes with menace condescending amusement the relish of power and delight in naughtiness. Picture is a bit too busy at times and excessively noisy more often than that to the extent that it will be too assaultive for some kids under five or six. At the same time adults had more in the way of story dynamics and characterization to grab onto in ""Antz."" But everyone in between these two extremes can be counted upon to be swept up by ""A Bugs Life."" Long end credits are spiced up by some very funny faux outtakes that are well worth sticking around for.
