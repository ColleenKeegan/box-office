More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

"Nick Noltes magical heist movie. Slate Sign In Sign Up Nick Noltes magical heist movie. Nick Noltes magical heist movie. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.April 4 2003 414 PM The Thief of Monte Carlo Nick Noltes magical heist movie. By David Edelstein Nolte with Kukhianidze No Dorian Gray he When at the recent Oscar ceremony Steve Martin used a mug shot of Nick Nolte from a DUI arrest as a punch line the joke seemed shoddier than if its butt had been a typically callow movie-star bad boy. Not to get too maudlin but theres something heroic about Noltes ruined physiognomy--something that doesnt seem right to jeer. Noltes hard living--and I mean the emotional turbulence as much as the drug and alcohol abuse--is right there in the deep creases of his face with its beefiness and its hollows in the doleful hoods over his eyes and in the bottomless voice that has dropped so far it sounds like a lyrical belch. Botox and plastic surgery have made many once-transparent actors tight and masklike but Nolte remains endlessly readable. Even when his characters cant express themselves the effort to signal through the fog carries its own indelible eloquence. Nolte is the Eugene ONeill of actors. Advertisement Im not romanticizing addiction or suggesting that one has to be a junkie to play a junkie etc. and Im not suggesting that Noltes new sobriety isnt a sound idea. But there are wrecks and there are mythic wrecks and Nolte is like a wreck from a more fabled era of Hemingway and Bogart and John Huston and Sterling Hayden. The latters performance in Hustons The Asphalt Jungle (1950) was one of the inspirations for Jean-Pierre Melvilles existentialism-as-personal-style thriller Bob le flambeur (1955) the tale of a Montmartre gamblers doomed attempt to knock over a casino--which is in turn the inspiration for Neil Jordans magical remake The Good Thief (Fox Searchlight). As the chivalric gambler Bob Montagnet Noltes vague resemblance to Hayden (and for that matter Huston) brings this story of an incorrigible risk-taker full circle. Jordans remake isnt a major work and Im not convinced that he figured out the right way to end it. But the director finds just the right blend of buoyancy and serenity. For all the movies pixilated transitions fisticuffs and hyper-alert climaxes at the roulette table theres a kind of temperamental evenness thats perfectly in sync with the protagonist. Noltes Bob is addicted to gambling but he has an Alcoholics Anonymous-ish attitude toward the outcome--he doesnt sweat over what he cant control. He not only takes betrayals in stride he counts on other people to act in their own interest. In some ways it frees him up to live in the moment free of dependencies. That doesnt mean he isnt generous to others--he jokes about himself as a knight in shining armor. At the heart of The Good Thief is his strange semi-paternal (which means semi-incestuous) relationship with a young Eastern European prostitute named Anne played by the arresting young Georgian actress Nutsa Kukhianidze. They dont have much of a physical rapport--even when Kukhianidze who has the puttyish face of a Leelee Sobieski atop a swan neck and some of the longest limbs in the movies strips down to her lingerie and taunts him (and some of us I might add). Its on a vocal level they connect. Kukhianidze has a low almost mumbly voice--dry and free of tinkle. It makes sense that Bobs angel would be sardonically offhand as glamorous and free of illusions as he is. Early on Bob gives Anne money for a hotel and says ""Gnight kid""--and then out of the ether so perfect that you want to cheer comes the similarly diffident/romantic voice croak of Leonard Cohen from his most recent CD Ten New Songs ""The ponies run the girls are young/ the odds are there to beat. You win a while and then its done/ your little winning streak./ And summoned now to deal with your/ invincible defeat/ You live your life as if its real/ a thousand kisses deep ... Im turning tricks Im getting fixed/ Im back on Boogie Street ..."" What Cohen brings to The Good Thief is the same air of beautiful fatalism he brought to Robert Altmans McCabe amp; Mrs. Miller (1971) and Atom Egoyans Exotica (1994). The music meshes perfectly with Chris Menges cinematography the glamorous dilapidation of Bobs gambling haunts juxtaposed with the swank of Monte Carlo where the climactic heist is set. The movie is tightly plotted but you dont think about the plot. You focus on the people and the colors and the sounds. Jordan and Menges achieve the sort of orbiting lyricism that Jonathan Demme tried to capture--and in spite of the best intentions in the world missed--in last years The Truth About Charlie. The faces are the movies texture Nolte Kukhianidze Tcheky Karyo as the policeman who wants to bring Bob down more out of love than hate that old French fox Gerard Darmon as Bobs longtime henchman the film director Emir Kusturica as Bobs electrified security consultant and Ralph Fiennes in a startling cameo as a sleazy art fence. This is a movie for which you want to give an award to the casting director Susie Figgis. The Good Thief also comes at a good time for our relations with the French It reminds us that our cultures have talked back and forth to each other with more intimacy than we ever have with the British. I prefer the sneaky French affection mixed with derision to the Brits more opportunistic distance--and Id wager the Irish Neil Jordan would agree. The Good Thief is a beautiful rapprochement.

The Good Thief"" is a winning hand. Audaciously retooling Jean-Pierre Melvilles 1955 French heist thriller-cum-character study ""Bob le flambeur"" as a cluttered crowd-pleasing multinational caper movie writer-director Neil Jordan delivers easily his most satisfying work since 1992s ""The Crying Game."" Central to auds enjoyment is Nick Noltes complex mischievous perf as tarnished knight Bob Montagnet a washed-up gambler and addict who envisions one last score as redemption for his recent sins. Sure its all been done before but seldom with this degree of vigor and panache. Sold as an exotic genre thrill ride -- think the glib glossiness of Warners ""Oceans Eleven"" remake with the crackling Gallic atmosphere of MGMs ""Ronin"" -- ""The Good Thief"" stands to be a solid earner and equally active in ancillary. Though key details differ pic hews closely to the originals plot structure. In a rundown Nice nightspot the dissolute Bob (Nolte) meets 17-year-old Eastern European immigrant waitress Anne (Nutsa Kukhianidze) while shooting up in the toilet. Moments later hes forced to save the life of longtime nemesis Roger (Tcheky Karyo) a cop ambushed by desperate Algerian drug dealer Said (Ouassini Embarek) under the nose of club owner Remi (Marc Lavoine). ""I always swore Id never share a needle"" Bob growls jamming a fistful of syringes into the young tough. After Remi gets rough with Anne Bob moves her first into a hotel then into his flat the chief furnishings of which are a roulette wheel in the living room and a cherished Picasso in the bedroom. (Bob cites the painter as the best thief ever ""He stole from everybody."") Annes obviously interested in the much older man but he rebuffs her flirtations with growling grace. Subsequently she and Bobs young disciple Paulo (Said Taghmaoui) become lovers. Meanwhile with buddy Raoul (Gerard Darmon) in tow Bob loses the last of his cash at the race track and finally approves Raouls long-cherished plan to rob a casino. Target is the Riviera where copies of famous works of art by Cezanne Picasso Modigliani and others loom over the clientele with the originals stored a block or so away in an impregnable vault. Scheme sets up a bogus robbery of the casino safe while a second team tunnels into the vault and boosts the pictures. All the while Bob himself -- everyones chief subject -- will distract the management by working the tables creating the perfect alibi. Balance of pic follows the gang as they plan and execute the heists. Bob goes cold turkey by handcuffing himself to his bed and funds the operation by selling his Picasso to sweaty local fence Tony Angel (last-billed Ralph Fiennes delivering a pungent cameo). The motley crew of recruits features eccentric computer whiz Vladimir (Sarajevo-born helmer Emir Kusturica) who installed the vaults security system; transsexual and arachnaphobic weightlifter Philippa (British actress Sarah Bridges); and twin casino security guards Albert and Bertram (American directors Mark and Mike Polish) who Bob discovers have already dreamt up a heist scheme of their own. Though pics paced a good deal faster than most of Jordans previous work helmer still finds narrative room to explore his ongoing themes of honor identity and faith among the fringe-dwellers. ""The good thief"" Bob explains to Roger as they wander through a church is the man hanging on the cross next to Jesus who repented just before his death. (Pic had originally been title ""Double Down"" to tie together blackjack strategy and the double robbery.) The character of Bob has clearly energized Nolte whose transformation from lowlife junkie to strutting high-roller is nothing less than extraordinary. Jordan and vet casting director Susie Figgis have surrounded the star with a galaxy of international character faces both old and new each of whom contributes seamlessly to the ensemble. Theres a brief shot of Nolte Darmon (the dapper bad guy in ""Diva"" itself inspired by ""Bob le flambeur"") and Kusturica in tight closeup thats the human equivalent of a thousand miles of hard road. Pics chief flaws are its valentines to the genre the sheer amount of mumbling and growling renders more than a few lines unintelligible while the last-reel twists come so thick and fast that they dont bear up to scrutiny and will doubtless leave auds scratching their heads in confusion. Tech package is aces. Oscar-winning d.p. Chris Menges and production designer Anthony Pratt combine to show Nice and Monte Carlo as a gaudy nocturnal playground of vice whether among the cluttered back-alley clubs or the gambling salons of the swells. Elliot Goldenthals score is supplemented by a superbly chosen batch of fresh pop tunes including Leonard Cohens ""A Thousand Kisses Deep"" Johnny Hallydays French-lingo cover of ""Black Is Black"" and Bonos treatment of the chestnut ""Thats Life.""

Written and directed by Neil Jordan. 108 minutes. Rated R for language sexuality drug content and some violence. Harvard Exit. Every amber-lit scene of Neil Jordans ""The Good Thief"" shot by cinematographer Chris Menges looks like its dipped in butterscotch; every moment of pale-pink light has the soft prettiness of a candy box. Its a visual treat though not entirely substantial -- this stylish heist flick is like an art house ""Oceans Eleven"" full of snappy lines and angular faces. Theres not much to remember a few days later but its eye candy of a very high order. The movies a bit of a departure for Jordan (just as the ""Oceans Eleven"" remake was for Steven Soderbergh) who usually delves into more challenging fare like his exquisite Graham Greene adaptation ""The End of the Affair"" or the dark tale of Irish childhood ""The Butcher Boy."" But here like Soderbergh hes been inspired to remake a light classic ""The Good Thief"" is based on the 1955 French heist film ""Bob le Flambeur."" And even more so Jordan seems inspired by Nick Noltes weathered face and by the opportunity to have Nolte rasp out the kind of twice-bitten dialogue you go to heist movies to see. Nolte plays Bob Montagnet a worn-out gambler with a puffed-out well-leathered face and a heroin problem. Hes a self-described lost soul hanging out in dimly lit clubs in the south of France and pondering the one big win that has so far escaped him. One evening he meets up with a husky-voiced young drifter named Anne (Nutsa Kukhianidze) newly arrived from Eastern Europe. Though Anne is hardly an innocent her youth and freshness seem to invigorate Bob and she becomes instrumental in the elaborate two-level robbery hes masterminding. The details of the heist are conveyed in a series of rapid-fire scenes; its not always easy to follow exactly whats happening nor does it seem terribly important. Better to see the movie as a feast of faces the silver-haired raised-eyebrow elegance of Gerard Darmon as Bobs accomplice; the passionate dark eyes of Said Taghmaoui as Bobs young protege; Kukhianidzes gamine beauty; the long almost equine faces of twin actors Mark and Michael Polish as they sit side-by-side in matching armchairs. Not to mention the perfectly etched cheekbones of A Very Well-Known Actor who appears in a delicious unbilled cameo as a shady art dealer who hisses to Bobs crew that if things dont go as planned ""what I do to your faces will definitely be Cubist."" (If I told you who it was Id be ruining a very sweet surprise.) But its Noltes movie and he dons the character of Bob like an old tuxedo worn to softness.

Starring Nick Nolte Tcheky Karyo and Nutsa Kukhianidze. Directed by Neil Jordan. (R. 109 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) To the extent that its a rhapsody on the theme of Nick Nolte ""The Good Thief"" has considerable charm. The story of a heroin-addicted American gambler living on the fringes in Nice it makes a case for the raspy-voiced rough- looking Nolte as the heroic embodiment of some kind of uncompromised value. The value itself is indistinct but it has something to do with being a man having a good time and always treating people as if theyre all right until they prove otherwise. ""Everybody likes Bob"" says a cop whos investigating Bob (Nolte) and theres no doubting it. We like him too. Weve always liked him. We like the mischief in his voice his self-deprecation and equanimity and his cold-eyed concentration in moments of crisis. So long as the camera is pointed at Nolte we like ""The Good Thief"" too. Based on the 1955 French noir film ""Bob le Flambeur"" the picture stars Nolte as a tapped-out gambler who decides to rob a cache of priceless paintings from a heavily guarded warehouse. In the process of deciding on and devising the caper Bob opens his home to an Eastern European runaway (Nutsa Kukhianidze) and kicks heroin cold turkey. In the first 45 minutes writer- director Neil Jordan persuades us to believe that ""The Good Thief"" is intended as a character study of this strangely jovial and openhearted criminal and that the crime story will be merely incidental. But soon Jordan shifts gears focusing on the robbery and on Bobs perpetual-night world of pimps thieves drug dealers and North African informants. Jordan is attempting something worthy. He wants to strike the balance that director Julien Duvivier achieved in ""Pepe le Moko"" (1937) of equally portraying a man and his world. But Pepe was in almost every scene while Bob drops out of the movie for stretches. Though it ultimately recovers too much of ""The Good Thief"" forgets about Bob and in the process the movie loses much of its allure and vividness. -- Advisory This movie contains strong language violence and sexual situations. -- Mick LaSalle GHOSTS OF THE ABYSS Documentary. Directed by James Cameron. (G. 59 minutes. At Metreon IMAX). One of the neophyte deep-sea explorers in James Camerons 3-D IMAX movie ""Ghosts of the Abyss"" recalls that his only other trip on a submarine was at Disneyland. Thats fitting because ""Titanic"" director Camerons documentary about his favorite doomed ocean liner is a lot like a theme-park ride occasionally exciting but carefully controlled. ""Ghosts"" might be billed as a documentary but its not exactly verite given its re-enactments superimposed images and scripted sound. After descending 12000 feet to the floor of the North Atlantic with ""Titanic"" actor Bill Paxton and a team of scientists and historians Cameron apparently found the wreckage visually wanting and decided to spice things up. After 91 years at the oceans floor the ship is not especially photogenic eroded by ""rusticles"" that obscure any sense of what it looked like during its brief seaworthy phase. But Cameron offers plenty of reminders of the ships heyday. We hardly get a chance to marvel at how a piece of intricate woodwork has survived the water before the director inserts a competing image of the woodwork when it was new. Its too much. Cameron and other filmmakers have explored the wreckage before but ""Ghost of the Abyss"" features robotic cameras that enter previously unexplored regions of the ship. The robots adventures carry a truly thrilling sense of the unknown. Plus the little buggers are awfully cute. The 3-D technology provides additional excitement. Early in the movie a piece of equipment seems to leap off the screen so close that children and dorky adults will try to reach out and touch it. Turns out your hand goes right through it. -- Carla Meyer STEVIE Documentary. Directed by Steve James. (Not rated. 140 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The 1995 film ""Hoop Dreams"" was an almost perfect documentary. The filmmakers placed their cameras and let the narrative of two high school basketball players with big dreams unfold on its own terms. They avoided the errors of becoming a part of the story appearing in the film or influencing the action. Steve James the director of ""Hoop Dreams"" makes all those mistakes in his new documentary ""Stevie."" Despite good reviews at this years Sundance Film Festival this is the kind of squishy lost cause that gives liberal guilt a bad name. When he was a college student at Southern Illinois University James volunteered to become an Advocate Big Brother. James was paired with Stevie Fielding a deeply troubled 11-year-old from the small town of Pomona Ill. It was not a pleasant experience. James frankly admits that he was relieved when his ""tour of duty"" was up and he moved to Chicago. Stevie needed more than a Big Brother. He needed professional help. But 10 years later James was still feeling guilty. He went back to Pomona to contact Stevie. As we see on film Stevie has done anything but turn his life around. Tattooed bearded and owner of a lengthy rap sheet Stevie has gone straight downhill. James for some reason thinks hes been appointed to straighten everything out. And to film the process of course. He lectures Stevie about his life inserts himself into a complex and unhealthy family situation and offers advice with the camera cranking. Even James realizes hes going too far. When Stevies mother Bernice who abandoned the boy finally agrees to meet with them it is a tense moment. ""I am not here to grill Bernice"" James reminds himself. Then as an aside he adds ""And then I proceeded to do just that."" Stevie is never a sympathetic character. He makes stubborn destructive decisions drinks and threatens to kill or beat family members and friends. He is inescapably screwed up and understandably so. Placed in a series of foster homes he was abandoned and sexually abused. As James was making the film he finds out not only that Stevie has been arrested for sexually abusing a child but also that it seems almost certain that he committed the crime. James original idea was to show how the system failed Stevie and to track what has happened. But he cant keep himself from getting into the action advising Stevie on what he should do during a meeting with his lawyer and appearing on camera asking painful questions of the family. At some point they must have wondered who is this guy and how did he get in our lives? In the end Stevie continues to spiral downward the family moves away and James ends up with a film that is a good 20 minutes too long. Thats the problem with vanity projects. Its hard to know when to stop. -- C.W. Nevius UNKNOWN PLEASURES Drama. (In Mandarin with English subtitles.) Starring Zhoa Tao  Zhao Wei Wei and Wu Qiong . Written and directed by Jia Zhang-Ke . (Not rated. 113 minutes. At Opera Plaza in San Francisco Shattuck Cinemas in Berkeley.) Two slacker guys are out of work. They wander listlessly around smoking moping and hanging out at the pool hall. They have dreams but no expectations of attaining them. They fall in love but the girls are unattainable. Even an attempt to join the military is a flop. Did we mention this is in China? There is no doubting that 33-year-old director Jia Zhang-Ke has captured the listless feel and bleak tone of the northern provinces in modern China. Datong the city where ""Unknown Pleasures"" takes place looks like a seedy beach town after the ocean dried up. But too much is left unsaid. The production notes reveal that Xiao Ji and Bin Bin the protagonists are part of Chinas new ""birth control generation."" With the national emphasis on fewer children the two like thousands of other young people in China endure a lonely family life without brothers or sisters. Around them the country is in cultural upheaval. Although there are no jobs a new freeway is being laid down in the moonscape terrain near town. Televisions and radios are everywhere. In fact a disembodied electronic voice blares in the background of nearly every scene either a newscast announcing that Beijing has been selected as host city for the 2008 Olympic Games or a truck with a loudspeaker cruising the streets and suggesting that everyone should play the lottery. This is all fine as far as it goes. Jia has a wonderful eye for detail and the sense that Bin Bin and Xiao Ji are being lost between the cracks in the new world is established perfectly. Now if only something happened. The story goes nowhere. We learn that the young men are in love but they cant seem to act on it. A menacing villain seems to be an important plot device but he abruptly disappears -- off camera. We dont understand the motivation of the characters. Jia also has a fondness for long long static shots. In one scene Xiao Ji attempts to run his puttering motorcycle up a small slope. He tries and kills the engine tries and kills the engine. This goes on four five times until you want to scream ""You are in the wrong gear"" -- C.W. Nevius MARION BRIDGE Family drama. Directed by Wiebke von Carolsfeld . Written by Daniel MacIvor . (Not rated. 90 minutes. At the Roxie Cinema.) In rural Nova Scotia three sisters attend their dying mother and struggle to avoid the effects of a family incident that darkened their lives years ago. ""Marion Bridge"" which takes its name from an optimistic Canadian pop song is an impressive first feature from Wiebke von Carolsfeld a German filmmaker in Toronto. Downbeat but ultimately hopeful its a domestic tragedy that cuts clearly to the bone finding emotional nuance among the familys knotty secrets and dense layers of subterfuge. Molly Parker (""The Center of the World"") plays the main role of Agnes the family black sheep whos come home after years in Toronto. A recovering drunk and druggie -- shes sober just 65 days and bound to backslide -- Agnes is the one who likes to ""cause a ruckus"" and prick at the scabs covering the familys collective shame. Theresa (Rebecca Jenkins) emotionally withdrawn and recently dumped by her husband assumes the role of family scold and moral judge while couch potato Louise (Stacy Smith) simply checks out watching hockey on TV and avoiding the subject of her emerging lesbianism. Von Carolsfeld sets a slow deliberate pace and Daniel MacIvors script builds suspense by parceling out information slowly -- withholding for example the whereabouts of the father or the identity of the girl (Ellen Page) who works at a gift shop and holds a strange fascination for Agnes. A couple of performances are weak Smith never gets beneath Louises surly detachment and Marguerite McNeil as the dying mother plays exactly one behavioral card in scene after scene grimacing crotchety discomfort. The richest nuggets are the scenes between Parker and Jenkins who genuinely look alike and could easily be mistaken for sisters -- a rarity for screen siblings. Parker is very good at conveying Agnes wobbly mixture of instability and emotional bravery and Jenkins finds the sad lonely ache below Theresas urge to regiment the lives of everyone in the family. Film buffs with long memories may recall Hollis McLaren the Canadian actress who played opposite Craig Russell in the 1978 film ""Outrageous"" She shows up here as the teenage girls protective mother. -- Advisory This film contains raw language. -- Edward Guthmann Most Popular 1 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 2 Cops Son of billionaire former supermodel arrested after... 3 Ann Coulter Hammered by Conservatives for Smearing US War... 4 Dear Abby I dont want anyone to know that Ive retired 5 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 6 33 signs youre living in the San Francisco bubble 7 Inmate charged in 2015 quadruple slaying in S.F. 8 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed 9 Police Girl 14 slits teens throat in hope of first kill 10 San Francisco ranks surprisingly low on the list of 20 Most...

But by now this overworked genre needs a fresh angle or two to attract moviegoers begging for something grown-up in theaters. Nick Nolte and Nutsa Kukhianidze star as a junkie/gambler and his (sort of) girl in The Good Thief. For them The Good Thief offers a couple of good benefits. One is the pleasing sight of Nick Nolte in fairly robust form given how that wasted-looking photo of him spurred one of Steve Martins gags during last months Oscarcast. The other is the chance to see an erratic but talented filmmaker (The Crying Games Neil Jordan) taking a reasonably successful crack at remaking a French film classic. This would be director Jean-Pierre Melvilles Bob Le Flambeur from 1955 in which lead Roger Duchesnes silver mane suggested a continental version of the late country singer Charlie Rich. Noltes version of Bob looks more like a Grecian Formula kinda guy who has been around both in life and on the French Riviera. Hes a junkie who nonetheless knows casino protocol and is still attractive enough to maintain at least the passing interest of a much younger Eastern European immigrant (Nutsa Kukhianidze). She waitresses in a not-so-nice Nice eatery where we see Bob shooting up and she later helps handcuff him to a bed when he goes cold turkey. Movie review The Good Thief ( out of four) This is necessary because an opportunity has presented itself a decoy casino robbery to camouflage a much bigger robbery of art by several masters. To come up with the stake money Bob unloads his own Picasso to a malevolent local fence played by Ralph Fiennes in a juicy cameo. This is a movie more interesting for its atmosphere and characters especially twin brothers who set up some nifty plotting. As a distrusting but sympathetic cop theres also an appealing turn by Tcheky Karyo a familiar face from The Patriot and The Core. Fox Searchlight is giving Thief a midweek opening and then a slow national breakout just as it did with Sexy Beast almost two years ago. This isnt as edgy or as original as that caper gem but in terms of its myriad screen predecessors its still on the high side of ""heist."" For a movie that earns its R-rating for drug content and violence atop language and sexuality it leaves you with the next thing to a mellow smile.

Its like a crumbly piece of parchment a road map on which the valleys of sin threaten to blot out the rest of the landscape. That hellion mug with its furrows and hollows is creased by far too much living and so is Noltes voice a low and lilting whiskey rasp that doesnt speak the words so much as singsong them into bitter mush like Tom Waits without the piano chords. In Neil Jordans The Good Thief Nolte plays a professional burglar and gambler named Bob Montagnet who also happens to be an unapologetic heroin addict. Bob an American living in Nice is the complete gutter romantic. We know this because Nolte gets to growl out a lot of existential film-noir pensees such as ""Always play the game to the limit - damn the consequences"" At the beginning the camera prowls a strip joint the dank bar bathed in a sexy smear of blue and pink neon and Nolte stirring up trouble at the backroom card table commands authority. At the same time he has done this weary ravaged-nobility routine once too often and the dialogue is so self-conscious that watching his performance is a bit like biting into an egg thats been hard-boiled...twice. Jordan has taken ""Bob le Flambeur"" Jean-Pierre Melvilles satiny little French safecracking thriller from 1955 and remade it by frosting it with so much underworld atmosphere and ""character"" that the heist is now effectively in the background. Bob may be killing himself with junk but hes still a chivalrous old dog. It doesnt take him long to become the protector of Anne (Nutsa Kukhianidze) a slinky Russian teenage gamine with a Dorothy Hamill haircut and an attitude of ironic precocity thats not nearly as charming as its meant to be. Its partly to help Anne that Bob handcuffs himself to his bed kicks his junk habit and goes in for one last score lifting 20 priceless paintings from a Monte Carlo casino the night before the Grand Prix. How will he do it? By pretending to rob the money vault. ""The Good Thief"" is a movie rife with extravagant gestures. Bobs hands-off attitude toward Anne is a rerun of the chaste mentor relationships in Jordans far richer ""The Crying Game"" and ""Mona Lisa"" and Bob tells the tale of how he won the Picasso painting on his garret wall by betting Pablo himself on a bullfight in 1969. To bankroll the robbery hell even sell that prize painting - damn the consequences The trouble with all this is that its thin movie tinsel that while lovingly polished never becomes more than tinsel. ""The Good Thief"" has a glib stylishness (the rapid freeze-frames at the end of scenes signify...nothing) yet it lacks a blast of reality to balance its fable. Bobs crew of multiculti lackeys is weirdly colorless and the heist has been staged with such random informality that its less clever than baffling; it never generates the devious clockwork pleasures of a movie like Soderberghs ""Oceans Eleven"" or the original ""Bob le Flambeur."" Jordan may think that hes transcending the genre but theres got to be more to a haunted romantic dream than Nick Noltes aura of honorable wreckage.

Bob measures his days in heroin hits his face a blurry mask under a bad dye job his eyes two defeated slits. For a while Nolte seems to be playing Nolte or at least the crumpled unmoored unmanned Nolte hes been perfecting in front of us for years from Karel Reiszs Wholl Stop the Rain? through Alan Rudolphs Afterglow to Paul Schraders Affliction. Then deliciously Jordan pulls the rug out. Into Bobs life steps Anne (played by the Georgian actress Nutsa Kukhianidze) a young Eastern European immigrant on the verge of being sold into drugs and prostitution. Slender slim-hipped with her unfashionably short pageboy and a lazily sexy voice just this side of nasal Kukhianidze is as enchanting a find as the sultry Kathy Tyson was in Jordans Mona Lisa. Her Anne already sports a black eye and a what-the-hell readiness to tag along with any man who offers her material support. The moment she lays eyes on Bob you can see her sizing him up for father lover protector very likely all three and she offers herself to him on the spot. He gives her a bed but refuses to sleep with her for shes awakened the reluctant knight in him as well as the dormant professional crook. When Bob receives a tip-off that huge amounts of available cash will be stored in the vault of a Monte Carlo casino the night before the Grand Prix he handcuffs himself to his bed detoxes in a matter of days and -- under the watchful but sympathetic eye of Roger (Tcheky Karyo) the cop who has put him away six times and still wants to save his soul -- sets about pulling together a team of pros for a cheeky heist. Bob is an art lover whose hero is Picasso (""The cat stole from everybody"") and when he hears that the casino is hung with copies of paintings whose originals lie in the vault hes doubly hooked. The Good Thief is a remake loving and faithful to the spirit if not the letter of Jean-Pierre Melvilles 1955 film noir classic Bob le Flambeur which was restored in exquisite black and white by Rialto Pictures and re-released in 2001. Melville widely considered the founder of the French New Wave was a rotund balding Jewish egghead who yearned to be an American gangster. Bob le Flambeur was originally conceived as a drama but once Melville had seen John Hustons 1950 The Asphalt Jungle he felt unable to top Hustons masterpiece and recast Bob as a caper underpinned by the wistful subtext of honor -- and betrayal -- among thieves that informed every film he made. (Small wonder that Quentin Tarantino asked by this paper in 1993 to list his five favorite movies of all time rated Melvilles Le Doulos among them.) Shot on location and using natural light the thinly plotted Bob le Flambeur is an homage not just to the tawdry charms of Montmartre but to the classic American movies of the 1930s and 40s with their sad-faced chain-smoking gangsters in trench coats. (Its star was the world-weary Roger Duchesne who reputedly had ties to the French mob.) The Good Thief doffs its cap in return both to European moviemaking and to the radically changed milieu of the Continent. Bobs team -- among them his impulsive North African junior partner Paulo (Said Taghmaoui) the strobe-lit electric-guitar-playing techno wizard Vlad (Serbian director Emir Kusturica) and an enigmatic pair of identical twins (played by the Polish brothers Mark and Michael) -- forms a seamy microcosm of the cosmopolitan New Europe.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm Like Melville though Jordan overlays the realist grit of the city with a swooning romanticism. With its rhythmic freeze-frames and pulsing score The Good Thief has the restless motion one associates with cinematographer Chris Menges (The Mission Michael Collins) and the casual joyousness of a work made out of sheer movie love. Everything is beautiful from the pathological vermilions and blues of Nices underworld to the winking lights of Monte Carlo where the inky purple-black of night fades to the brilliant blue of a sunlit day recalling the fairy-tale atmospherics of Jordans lovely 1991 movie The Miracle. Indeed The Good Thief is a fairy tale not just in the plotted fun of the heist and counterheist or in the clever twist thrown in at the end but in the grandiloquent myth so passionately espoused by Melville of the crook as a man of honor and elegance. By the end of the movie distracted by a night at the roulette wheel with his young siren Bob has become the good thief in more ways than one a well-dressed high roller who instead of bedding a woman places his hand in the small of her back and takes her shopping; a man who will never betray or tolerate betrayal; a man who having been lost is returned to himself through a womans love and the exercise of his calling. This is bunk but it is gloriously beguiling bunk the kind that will never go away because it speaks to so many American desires -- the desire to get rich at a stroke to defang the criminal and remake him as a hero who cant harm us to believe that it is luck and style not the daily grind that will bring us success and happiness. Isnt it romantic? Among the shrinking tribe of filmmakers who still make movies about working people there is a marked tendency to define their subjects only by the problems that are thought to afflict that class -- poverty gangs violence drugs booze. However well-meaning this is a form of condescension one that the Belgian writer-directors Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardennes have largely avoided by honoring their characters with inner lives. The brothers muse is Olivier Gourmet an owlish impassive actor who starred in La Promesse and Rosetta and who last year won Best Actor at Cannes for his performance in the Dardennes brothers remarkable new film The Son (Le Fils) the story of a Herculean emotional struggle undertaken in near total silence. Gourmet -- an astonishingly physical actor -- plays Olivier a carpentry instructor who works at a vocational-training center for boys. Hes a man of few words and these are almost all concrete and functional related to the work activity that we sense may be all he has left in life. We meet him as he prowls around restless and agitated spying on a new arrival at the center a pinched expressionless lad of 16 named Francis (Morgan Marinne) who in turn becomes obsessed with his instructor. Though at first it seems that the boy might be a son long ago abandoned by Olivier when the older mans ex-wife Magali (Isabella Soupart) shows up to let him know shes pregnant and about to marry the father (""I want to start something new"" she says) we later learn that Francis whos just been released from juvenile hall is the killer of their only son. On hearing that Olivier has chosen to take a particular interest in the boy Magali is horrified. The Son makes no attempt to entertain us. Much of this extraordinarily tactful movie like Rosetta is shot in close-up focusing on the back of Oliviers neck as if inviting us to see the world as he does or to enter his head and try to understand the emotions of a man who doesnt understand them himself. Olivier and the boy circle each other draw together move apart. One waits for closure and instead there is the slowly unfolding revelation of a man torn between rage at the loss of his son and the unspoken desire welling up like a long-suppressed groan to become a father again.
