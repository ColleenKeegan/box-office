"Crank is violently preposterous fun - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MUSIC REVIEW Crank is violently preposterous fun By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  September 2 2006 ``Crank"" does the plot of the old thriller ``D.O.A."" -- in which a poisoned man has 24 hours to find his killer and an antidote -- one better. Here the hit man hero (Jason Statham) has been injected with a Chinese drug cocktail that is gradually slowing his heart down and the only way to ward off death is to keep the adrenaline constantly pumping.Thats right Its ``Speed"" in a human being.They dont screen movies like this for critics which is a shame because ``Crank"" is an efficient witty junkyard dog of an action movie for its first hour. Unfortunately the script runs out of gas before the hero does.While its cooking though its violently preposterous fun. Statham who rose out of the British gangster-movie scene to star in the slam-bam ``Transporter"" series suggests Woody Harrelsons feral brother with less hair and a dash more brains. His character here is saddled with a profoundly stupid name -- Chev Chelios -- and a big problem He wakes one smoggy L A morning to discover hes been dosed by gangster Ricky Verona (Jose Pablo Cantillo) in retaliation for a job done too well. (Dont ask its not worth explaining.)A quick call to his personal Dr. Feelgood (Dwight Yoakam ) leads to Chevs mission somehow keep pumped up while chasing down the bad guys. The accelerants are many and varied and they include over-the-counter nasal spray under-the-counter epinephrine cocaine snorted off a bathroom floor and many many cans of Red Bull. When in doubt the hero puts his hand in a waffle iron.This is deeply silly stuff and the writing-directing team of Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor knows to play it mean fast and funny. With his British growl and bulldog stance Statham seems like a man having a particularly trying day at the office -- one that involves hijacking an EMT gurney or stealing an LAPD motorcycle while dressed in a hospital gown.The fringes of the movie however consist of standard bullets-and-babes cliches and eventually they move in for the kill. The few women in ``Crank"" are merely hood ornaments and sadly that includes Amy Smart as Chevs girlfriend Eve who until recently thought he was a videogame programmer.Smart does what she can to make the character a charming ditz but by the time Eves having public sex with Chev on a crowded Chinatown sidewalk believability has been tossed out the window. The final 20 minutes of ``Crank"" are bloody and routine and the trashy high spirits turn smug. Lost in the fray is a fun little turn as Chevs transvestite friend by Efren Ramirez better known as Pedro in ``Napoleon Dynamite.""What dynamite is here goes off early. ``Crank"" works overtime to keep the metabolism juiced with manic editing and a smart soundtrack that moves from full-on punk to Harry Nilssons ``Everybodys Talking."" Only action diehards will make it to the final credits satisfied though. Me I need a nap.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

Crank keeps the blood rushing. 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Crank Action. Starring Jason Statham Amy Smart Jose Pablo Cantillo Dwight Yoakam. Directed by Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor. (R. 83 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) When ""Crank"" writer-directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor claim to suffer from attention deficit disorder they mean it. The duos feature debut is one long fragmented rush geared toward fans of shooter video games. All it needs is a joystick. ""Crank"" opens with freelance hit man Chev Chelios (Jason Statham of the ""Transporter"" movies) hearing some bad news from uber-thug Ricky Verona (Jose Pablo Cantillo) Hes been slipped a serum that will kill him in an hour if his heart rate slips below ""rabid."" With a little help from his shady friend Doc (Dwight Yoakam) Chelios vows to keep his adrenal glands in hyperdrive long enough to nail his nemesis and if hes lucky find an antidote before the movies 83 minutes run out. Now the fun begins. In a delirious cross between ""D.O.A."" (without the noir) and ""Speed"" (minus the bus) Chev rips a violent swath across Los Angeles while huffing cocaine junk food and Red Bull and littering the landscape with mutilated corpses and spent ammo. Amped up and bare-buttocked he rockets down the street on a stolen police motorcycle; he trashes multiple cars and annihilates a shopping mall; he busts up a hospital ward and has public -- very public -- sex with his bubble-brained girlfriend Eve (Amy Smart). Manic editing and visual effects underscore Chevs perpetual buzz. Drawing on their background in commercials and music videos Neveldine and Taylor fly so high over the top with visuals they go into orbit. Four-way split screens alternate with camera zooms and tracking shots keeping audience members in overdrive and reminding them theyre essentially watching a full-length video game populated by meat puppets in place of avatars. Actually Statham could pass for a pixilated antihero. All icy stare and cool deliberation hes part human hand grenade part Energizer bunny on speed and signifies machismo with a knowing scenery-chewing wink. Smart in a role that belies her name fares worse If Eve the Dumb Blonde Chick is meant to satirize an action-film stereotype it falls a hundred miles short. In the final analysis (if analysis applies here which it doesnt really) ""Crank"" is shameless. I say this with love. Self-awareness is the trademark of good trash entertainment and ""Crank"" revels in its own cartoonish and offensive excess. Looking for some kind of nuanced meaning in this movie is as absurd as pondering the hermeneutics of a roller coaster. Its all about the dumb thrill baby. Leave it alone or leave your brain and pocket change at the gate strap yourself in and just enjoy the ride. -- Advisory Contains violence profanity sexual situations and drug use.

"Crank | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; crank ) Crank (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli Theres not much of a mystery about what Crank delivers. As promised its 85 minutes of action with little in the way of encumbrances like dialogue and exposition and only skeletal fragments of a narrative to keep things moving. For the most part Crank rolls along with a tongue-in-cheek approach - the over-the-top action is delivered with a side order of cheese and theres plenty of humor to accompany the testosterone and adrenaline (emphasis on ""adrenaline"") cocktail. In fact since the only unique aspect of the action is the MTV-influenced manner in which the directors have chosen to frame their movie one could argue that Crank works best as a comedy. Its occasionally funny and some times very funny. The story is as dumb as it sounds but who cares? One doesnt attend Crank for incisive dialogue or intelligent plotting. Like Snakes on a Plane it has a niche audience and it aims to please them. (Plus it outdoes Snakes profanity by at least a factor of four.) Beware false advertising however. Commercials for this movie are comparing it to Speed and thats as unfair as it is inaccurate. Speed was a nail-biter; Crank wont damage any manicures. For those looking for something similar how about the little-seen 1994 action/comedy The Chase with Charlie Sheen and Kristy Swanson? Like Crank that offered lots of unthreatening action alongside a helping of humor. Chev Chelios (no-nonsense Jason Statham) ace hitman for mobster Carlito (Carlos Sanz) has been poisoned by punk gangster Verona (Jose Pablo Cantillo). He has less than an hour to live and his friendly doctor Doc Miles (Dwight Yoakim) is traversing the friendly skies and not close enough to provide immediate assistance. The only way for Chev to extend his life long enough to either obtain an antidote to the ""Beijing cocktail"" or kill everyone who was involved in eliminating him is to keep his adrenaline level consistently high. That means taking drugs engaging in high-speed chases with the police robbing stores fighting people and having public sex with his dumb blond girlfriend Eve (a delightfully ditzy Amy Smart). If Chev slows down he risks lapsing into a coma but how long can his heart take the adrenaline rush? There are times when Crank feels less like a movie than an opportunity for co-directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor to show off. They throw every stylistic technique imaginable at the viewer split screens distorted images first-person shots slow-motion fast-motion still photographs animated representations of the heart subtitles and more. Theres a scene in which Chev is talking to someone on a cell phone and that persons picture appears on a nearby wall. Theres no doubt the directors approach amps up the energy level but theres a sense it crosses the line into overkill. Even in a movie were never expected to take even a little seriously its too much. Crank was not screened for critics which was arguably a mistake. Stuffy overly serious writers might not like what the movie has to offer but most will take it in the intended spirit. For those who enjoy this brand of wholly mindless entertainment Crank delivers. It also cements Labor Day as Jason Statham Day. The British tough guy who can keep a straight face in the midst of carnage mayhem and ripe dialogue ruled the roost a year ago with The Transporter 2 and now hes back to try again. Fortunately as long as youre in the right mood theres nothing laborious about sitting through this breezy bloody feature.

Crank -- as showily amped up and amiably amoral an extreme action pic as the exhaust-end of summer deserves -- has him doing a heap of hurting with a sneer Statham plays the ethno-mysteriously named Chev Chelios a badass hitman in L.A. whos been seriously messed up by poison injected in his body by worseasses. Something about the deadly ""Beijing Cocktail"" (as diagnosed by his doctor played with a loony Quaalude mellow by Dwight Yoakum) will shut down Chevs heart -- if he doesnt keep the adrenaline pumping. ""You stop you die"" says the doc his dialogue distinguishable from that of Dennis Hopper in Speed by the absence of the catchphrase ""pop quiz."" On doctors orders Chev doesnt stop and neither do writer-directors Mark Neveldine (a former stuntman) and Brian Taylor (a former visual effects guy) who treat chopped-off hands blown-out brains outdoor-in-a-crowd sex (its a buzz replenisher) and Chevs joyride on a cops stolen motorcycle (in a hospital gown bare butt on cheeky display) with equal dumbass weightlessness. The movie is cranked up somewhere between stylish and proudly stupid dusted with sunniness from Amy Smart (as Chevs sleepy girlfriend) -- and guaranteed to be out of your system by the time the lights come up.

Doing the same for viewers however proves a taller order. Videogamers whove been itching for ""Grand Theft Auto The Movie"" can tide themselves over in the meantime with ""Crank"" a down-and-dirty actioner that follows a rugged antihero trying to outrun death by keeping his adrenaline flowing. Doing the same for viewers however proves a taller order and pics prescription of killings car chases and indecent exposure -- held together by a chaotic editing scheme only a crackhead could love -- doesnt add up to much more than a few bloody chuckles. Nonetheless auds with an appetite for low-budget schlock and star Jason Statham should help Lionsgate crank out respectable theatrical and homevid numbers. For their first feature writer-directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor (whose background in commercials and musicvideos is readily apparent) have cooked up a scenario that crosses the slow-down-and-you-die premise of 1994s ""Speed"" with the 1950 film noir ""D.O.A."" in which a dying man sets out to discover who poisoned him. ""Crank"" answers that question at the outset as freelance hit man Chev Chelios (Statham) doubled over in pain watches a video in which thug Ricky Verona (Jose Pablo Cantillo) taunts him with the news that hes been injected with a Chinese toxin that will kill him in an hour. On the advice of his doctor (Dwight Yoakam) Chev must stay in constant motion to slow down the poison and hopefully buy enough time to exact revenge -- or even better find an antidote. Result is a nonstop rampage through the streets of Los Angeles that more or less plays like ""Run Chev Run"" with the assassin leaving a trail of corpses hijacked vehicles and thousands of dollars worth of property damage in his wake. His heart ticking like a time bomb in his chest Chev lives each moment as if it were his last in the process learning that nothing gets the blood racing quite like public humiliation. To that end the image of Chev riding a cops motorcycle in a hospital gown serves as a mere warm-up for the rousingly funny scene where he takes his clueless girlfriend Eve (Amy Smart) for a different sort of ride smack in the middle of Chinatown. By that point its clear that pic longs to be a pulpy disreputable B movie a desire it signals with a grungy high-def palette and haphazard editing (the press materials proudly trumpet ""Crank"" as ""the ultimate A.D.D. movie""). From the very first scene pics hyperactive visual style is all over the place lurching from frenzied p.o.v. tracking shots to four-way split-screen with every shot seeming to play in fast-forward mode. Yet for all its busyness ""Crank"" never develops much momentum not least because an exploding heart doesnt carry quite the same stakes as an exploding bus. And as violent as much of it is (Neveldine and Taylor seem to have a particular fondness for mutilated hands) the film doesnt have the requisite action chops to deliver any memorable fight sequences. Statham has carried movies (""The Transporter"" franchise) and played ruthless killers (""Cellular"") in the past; here as a roguishly likeable muscleman with a 10 oclock shadow he gets to do both. Performance in which Statham did his own stunts compels interest even as one wishes the charismatic Brit thesp better vehicles in the future. Tech contributions are perhaps deliberately cruddy while the cartoonish inserts of Chevs ticker and a pixilated post-credits sequence blatantly underscore pics resemblance to a videogame.

Statham is Chev Chelios a British hitman living it up in LA - thats until hes injected with a lethal poison by gangsters and informed that he has about an hour to live. His doctor (Dwight Yoakam) informs him that in order to stay alive he has to keep the adrenaline flowing which means Americas favourite British thug is compelled to tear around LA shooting shagging and snorting as many drugs as he can get his hands on. The clock-ticking premise keeps the pace going nicely although a sympathetic hero would make this more compelling. As it is you dont care if Chelios lives or dies at the end of the film as long as he survives for long enough to keep up his yobbish antics. The supporting characters are no less stereotypical from the mincing gay lookout to the ditsy blonde girlfriend Eve (Amy Smart). Theres an offensive scene in which Chelios forces Eve into public sex only for her to submit midway and beg for more. This is the point at which many a liberal viewers sense of humour will fail. In general however the film is so jubilantly over the top and aware of its own failings its hard not to laugh. After all you dont see Jason Statham running around the streets in a hospital gown with a huge erection every day - a fact for which we should be grateful.

Is that even a name or a greeting in some language I dont know about before they smack you in the face with their fist? Is the Stath doing an American accent in this film? Anyway another enjoyable day in the life of Jason Statham film this time hes been injected with a special form of poison meaning hes not allowed to stop punching or hell die.... If thats not a great storyline I dont know what is. My only complaint is it could have done with a bit more Stath martial arts.
