Filmed during two live performances (Jan. 25-26) in Washington D.C. By turns defiant and apologetic gleefully raunchy and anxiously defensive ""Martin Lawrence Live Runteldat"" finds the popular comic actor returning to his standup roots for a one-man show that plays as much like public relations spin as profanely funny entertainment. Filmed during two live performances (Jan. 25-26) at Constitution Hall in Washington D.C. comedy concert pic should easily surpass 10.1 million domestic gross of 1994s ""You So Crazy"" Lawrences previous solo opus. Still uneven laffer isnt likely to be a long-distance runner in theatrical gigs. Ancillary biz may be something worth telling about however. ""Runteldat"" begins with brief semi-serious biodoc -- evidently prepared as curtain-raiser for Lawrences standup gigs -- that recaps career highlights (winning awards appearing opposite Will Smith in ""Bad Boys"" and Eddie Murphy in ""Life"" flying solo in ""Big Mamas House"") and public embarrassments. Latter are detailed by actors cast as fatuous ""newscasters"" who come off as impossibly smug while they spill the beans about poor put-upon Lawrence. Intro primes aud to expect a total whitewashing of Lawrences more spectacular misadventures. And indeed that impression is only reinforced when early in his standup routine he launches into a foul-mouthed preemptive strike on critics. (To be fair though tirade may be less a response to gossipmongers than a reply to scathing reviews for Lawrences work in ""Whats the Worst That Could Happen?"" and ""Black Knight."") For the first hour or so ""Runteldat"" is a sporadically funny performance of hit-and-miss banter periodically interrupted by what sound like craven appeals for sympathy. Lawrence repeatedly refers to his life philosophy (""Ride it until the fuckin wheels fall off"") and frequently reminds aud ""No one is immune to the trials and tribulations of life."" On the plus side Lawrence also offers some inspired bits about sex corporal punishment and the dangerously liberating properties of Courvoisier. Just as amusingly he proves to be rapier-sharp when dealing with a heckler ""Somebody put something in that guys mouth my zippers stuck"" It isnt until the 75-minute mark however that Lawrence gets around to admitting his own role in his bad press. After a mock-serious attempt at rationalization he cheerfully admits that yeah he really was higher than a kite that day in 1997 when he was found screaming incoherently at passing cars on a busy L.A. street. (He was subsequently apprehended and hospitalized.) And while he insists ""the other guy started it"" during a much-reported nightclub fight he concedes he was scared semi-straight when a judge threatened him with hard prison time. Lawrence is even more self-critical -- and yes much funnier -- when he describes his 1999 brush with death while jogging in 100-degree heat while wearing heavy attire. He wanted to get into shape; instead he landed in an emergency room and spent much of his long recovery period relearning how to walk and talk -- and even go to the bathroom on his own. Even during these revealing moments however theres something a mite too contrived about Lawrences insistent sincerity a tad too self-defensive about his seeming candor. Its hard to watch ""Runteldat"" without thinking of Richard Pryors 1979-83 string of comedy concert pics -- which are more or less the gold standard for this type of solo opus -- and remembering Pryors totally unapologetic frankness while describing among other things his arrest for shooting his own car (""Richard Pryor -- Live in Concert"") and his scary/funny description of his self-immolation while free-basing (""Richard Pryor Live on the Sunset Strip""). Lawrence and director David Raynr obviously studied Pryors films before mounting their own production. (Both ""Runteldat"" and ""Live in Concert"" it should be noted climax with a graphic sexual anecdote in which a woman gets the last word.) Raynrs pic has appreciably slicker production values -- savvy camera placement and sharp editing make for a smooth seamless performance -- but ""Runteldat"" is far less consistently hilarious and much less forthcoming. At the end of Lawrences performance theres a jarringly sappy touch A large photo of the star with a supposedly handwritten message ""We are one."" Judging from what precedes this greeting-card sentiment he might as well have scrawled ""Please love me"" Martin Lawrence Live RunteldatProductionA Paramount release of an MTV Pictures presentation of a Runteldat Entertainment production.

Directed by David Raynr . (Rated R. 104 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Using the stage as a launching pad for confessions finger-pointing foul- mouthed observations and deadpan imitations Martin Lawrence spares no one -- including himself -- in ""Martin Lawrence Live Runteldat"" a movie that is not only achingly funny but also full of serious and philosophical truisms. Filmed in January when Lawrence performed in Washington D.C. ""Martin Lawrence Live"" features the comedian-actor talking about race relations in a post-Sept. 11 America (""I havent seen this many black and white people coming together since Stevie Wonder and Paul McCartney did Ebony and Ivory "") sex alcoholism the PBS series on civil rights called ""Eye on the Prize"" raising kids (""whip your childs ass if they act up"") marriage and the personal crises and police incidents that almost killed him and destroyed his career. Lawrence blames the media for sensationalizing his personal life including his bizarre 1996 shouting match with motorists and police on Ventura Boulevard in Los Angeles and his 1999 coma (which happened after he jogged in blazing temperatures and collapsed). Onstage and in front of the films cameras Lawrence acknowledges he was high on ""evil weed"" during the the 1996 incident and that the 1999 coma left him so crippled in a hospital he suffered from extreme incontinence -- an embarrassing lack of control he can now make fun of especially as he recalls the beautiful nurse who wiped him off day after day. ""This woman was cleaning doo-doo off me"" Lawrence marvels. ""I started falling in love (with her)."" Sex dominates his topics. There isnt a sexual subject he ignores whether its sexual organs sexual positions sexual practices or sexual taboos. Yes there is lots of crude language in ""Martin Lawrence Live"" but it fits the tone of Lawrences frenetic performance. Lawrence who starred in ""Black Knight"" ""Big Mommas House"" and ""Whats the Worst That Could Happen?"" slows down when he has to as when he talks about his failed marriage but its his wide-eyed rapid-fire comments that are most humorous and illuminating. ""Martin Lawrence Live"" captures a brilliant performer at the top of his craft. You dont have to agree with Lawrences opinions to appreciate his unique physical and mental gifts. . This film contains crude language about sex and other topics. -- Jonathan Curiel KARMEN GEI Musical drama. Starring Djeinaba Diop Gai Magaye Niang Stephanie Biddle Thierno Ndiaye Dos Djeynaba Niang and El Hadji Ndiaye. Directed and written by Joseph Gai Ramaka. (Not rated. 82 minutes. In French and Wolof with English subtitles. At the Castro Theatre.) . Linked in the public consciousness to composer Georges Bizet ""Carmen"" is probably the most famous opera in the world. With ""Karmen Gei"" director Joseph Gai Ramaka has set the story in his native Senegal replaced the music and choreography with African beats and moves and created a bisexual Carmen who may be the most magnetic most beautiful and bravest Carmen ever to grace a stage or film set. Actress Djeinaba Diop Gai pulsates with joie de vivre as the rebellious woman who seduces the warden of her prison engineers the rescue of a jailed suitor publicly belittles Senegals police corps and leads an idealistic gang of smugglers. (Her character is named Karmen not Carmen perhaps to differentiate her from all the previous incarnations of this operatic figure.) Gais Karmen has an infectious sense of humor which she uses to diffuse the men who are incredulous that such a striking woman can overpower them. The films levity (some of the scenes are almost campy) and playful spirited musical score make this version of ""Carmen"" even more unusual. American jazz saxophonist David Murray composed the songs which feature some of Senegals great performers including singer El Hadji Ndiaye who also has a role in the film. The movie is not without its flaws among them Gais singing voice which doesnt have the pitch or power of say Ndiayes. But there is so much working for ""Karmen Gei"" -- including the scenes of Goree Island where millions of slaves were first taken centuries ago; the colorful African fabrics that are worn by the women prisoners; and the portrayal of Karmen Gei as a kind of superhero to the downtrodden -- that the film becomes an overwhelming pleasure and you find yourself rooting for Gais character to avoid the fate that has befallen every other Carmen before her. . This film contains violence nudity and sex scenes. -- Jonathan Curiel  HAPPY TIMES  Drama. Starring Zhao Benshan and Dong Jie. Directed by Zhang Yimou. Written by Giu Zi. (Rated PG. 106 minutes. In Mandarin with English subtitles. Opens today at the Lumiere and Camera in San Jose; Aug. 9 at the Shattuck in Berkeley and Aquarius in Palo Alto; Aug. 16 at the Rafael in San Rafael.) . Zhang Yimou the Chinese director of ""Raise the Red Lantern"" ""Shanghai Triad"" and ""Ju Dou"" made an international reputation with vivid turbulent tales of passion and rebellion drawn against a canvas of Chinese history. More recently in ""The Road Home"" and ""Not One Less"" and the sentimental ""Happy Times"" Zhang tends toward melodrama played in a minor key. One feels the dimming of a certain ambition but in its place a sweetness clarity and emotional openness that recalls the classics of early Italian neorealism. Walking a sometimes-shaky line between tenderness and schmaltz ""Happy Times"" introduces Zhao (Zhao Benshan) an unemployed 50-plus hustler who pretends hes a wealthy hotel owner to impress the oversize divorcee (Dong Lihua) he hopes to marry. In fact his only ""hotel"" is an abandoned bus that he rents by the hour to amorous young couples. Zhaos intended is grumpy and demanding and when she pressures him to find a job for winsome Wu (Dong Jie) her blind 18-year-old stepdaughter Zhaos flimflammery spins out of control. Recruiting his retired pals he builds a faux massage parlor in a crumbling warehouse enlists said pals as customers and thinks hes fooled both Wu and the grump. Theres a maudlin quality to the poor blind teenager despised by her stepmother -- silent tearjerkers were rife with such characters -- and even with Zhangs polished direction Zhaos humor and Dongs quiet dignity one feels the manipulative tug of a baldly sentimental tale. Melodrama has its place though and Zhangs commitment to irony-free emotion -- the bond between Zhao and Wu the steadfast hope in her search for her father the devotion of Zhaos circle of friends -- is admirable. -- Edward Guthmann THE MASTER OF DISGUISE Comedy. Starring Dana Carvey  James Brolin and Jennifer Esposito . Directed by Perry Andelin Blake . (PG. 80 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . Its a measure of this movies dreadfulness that the experience of ""The Master of Disguise"" is even worse for people who are particular fans of its star Dana Carvey. Heres a genuinely funny and engaging comedian and yet we find him pouring his energy and considerable good will into a string of not- funny not-distinct characters. At times it actually hurts to watch. Carvey plays an Italian immigrant Pistachio with a gift for complete transformation that hes inherited from his father Frabbrizio (James Brolin). But at the start of the movie hes a waiter in an Italian restaurant. He trips and several plates of spaghetti go flying landing on the heads of diners. After fumbling for a few seconds he tries to make amends by sprinkling the diners heads with Parmesan cheese. If Carvey were playing a complete idiot -- along the lines of a Jerry Lewis character -- the cheese bit might have been funny. But Pistachio inhabits a kind of dead zone between contemptible imbecile and sensitive bumbler. Hes not someone to laugh at and hes not someone to laugh with. Hes someone to endure. The story involves Pistachios coming into his birthright as a disguise master. In an effort to rescue his parents from a criminal mastermind (Brent Spiner) he assumes a number of identities -- a suave Englishman a bucktoothed Alpine and a man who inexplicably resembles a turtle. The movie is if anything an excuse for Carvey to don these personae but they all lack incisiveness and satirical punch -- as does Carveys softball imitation of George W. Bush who is seen trying to rescue an original copy of the Constitution of all things. The disguise gimmick is also an excuse for a number of celebrity cameos which culminate in a mask being pulled off to reveal Frabbrizio. The most interesting cameo is that of Bo Derek who appears in her ""10"" outfit from 1979 looking slightly better than she did 23 years ago. In a movie about transformation Derek shows that not transforming can sometimes be even more amazing. -- Mick LaSalle Most Popular 1 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 2 Cops Son of billionaire former supermodel arrested after... 3 Ann Coulter Hammered by Conservatives for Smearing US War... 4 Dear Abby I dont want anyone to know that Ive retired 5 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 6 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed 7 Police Girl 14 slits teens throat in hope of first kill 8 Inmate charged in 2015 quadruple slaying in S.F. 9 Bikini-clad Swedish cop makes arrest while sunbathing 10 33 signs youre living in the San Francisco bubble Find Showtimes Search Theaters amp; Showtimes -- County -- Alameda Contra Costa Lake Marin Napa San Francisco San Mateo Santa Clara Solano Sonoma Show Movies Now Playing | Recent Releases | Critics Favorites Rated G | PG | PG-13 | R Latest News Coast Guard searching delta region for three missing people Officials believe no survivors in Texas hot air balloon crash Outrage caution from Latino stars in critical election year Little shake 2.7-magnitude earthquake rattles Bay Area Philippine president calls off truce after rebel attack Ann Coulter slammed for calling war heros dad angry Muslim Inmate charged in 2015 quadruple slaying in S.F.

At 36 he no longer talks about women as if he were some hip-hop pasha; theres a new empathy to his raunch. That said for every routine thats fresh like the one in which Lawrence enacts what it would look like if Martin Luther King Jr. had decided just once to get some payback theres another thats facile and rote. This is confessional comedy lite from a performer who should realize by now that he only gets funnier the more he reveals.
