Hes Bobby Bowfinger a producer/director with no credits and no credit. Even the self-deluded BB knows its now or never time when his accountant gifts him a screenplay the alien invasion story Chubby Rain. Bobby rounds up the best cast and crew 2100 can buy and convinces them hes landed action superstar Kit Ramsey (Murphy) for the lead. His conceit has an oblivious Ramsey re-acting for hidden cameras in a verite action movie. Cinema nouveau Bobby calls it. Directed by Frank Oz from Martins own laugh out loud script this endows showbiz stereotypes with a hardbitten narcissism that doesnt preclude a certain innocence. The supporting turns are generous by any standards with Murphy near his best (he doubles as his own stand-in) and Graham having a ball as the worlds worst actress. Preposterous and utterly self-absorbed this has la-la land down to a tee.

Starring Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy. Written by Martin. Directed by Frank Oz. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The title character of Steve Martins ""Bowfinger"" is a never-say-die two-bit director who is as phony as his detachable Hollywood-hip ponytail. And just as oddly lovable. In his own skewed way he is his own man and true to his dream. Not as much can be said for Kit Ramsey Tinseltowns most powerful action star and also the most paranoid if that is possible. He is played by Eddie Murphy and the finale with Martin becomes a sly twist on black-and-white buddy movies. These two Mamp;Ms are a handful. Related Stories `Bowfinger Jabs Hollywood / Martin Murphy in hilarious comedy Martin also wrote the script a venomous Valentine to Hollywood sugarcoated with laughs. It melts in your mouth not in your hand. Martins setup is pure genius. If the follow-through threatens never to reach the heights of unbridled hilarity dont fret. In the last five minutes it does. Compulsive liar Bobby Bowfinger (Martin) puts up his life savings of exactly 2184 to make his first movie ""Chubby Rain"" and has leveraged the rest of his cast by convincing them that Ramsey will star in it. The only glitch is that Ramsey hasnt been told let alone agreed. Heres the beauty part. Bowfinger shoots his movie ambush-style (like ""60 Minutes"" reporters). Actors in ""Chubby Rain"" an alien-invasion slasher potboiler approach the increasingly freaked Ramsey in public and deliver their lines in sight of a hidden camera. Among the supporting cast is Murphy again double-cast as a Ramsey look-alike a goofy good-natured hash-slinger named Jiff with braces on his teeth whose response to all his good luck is ""Awesome"" Bowfinger hires him as a Ramsey stand-in and gofer. Murphy is up for both roles. As the short- fused action star he is sleek volatile and sometimes across the border of hysteria. As Jiff he has a huge but sheepish metallic grin a smile that is sometimes close to tears. Bowfinger has assembled a group of Hollywood hangers-on for the ""Chubby Rain"" cast and were close to Nathaniel Wests ""Miss Lonelyhearts"" territory here. Heather Graham (""Austin Powers The Spy Who etc."") is a standout as a faux-naive aspiring starlet who progressively sleeps her way through the company as she learns whos got the juice. She lays where the power lies. Another is Christine Baranski (""The Birdcage"") as an actress who behaves like a Hollywood legend even though nobodys ever heard of her. ""Hes brilliant"" she says of her scenes with the clueless Ramsey. ""His fear is so real. We work really well together."" Theres plenty of justification for Ramseys paranoia but hes got a leg up anyway. The African American superstar (Ramsey not Murphy himself) sees white conspiracies everywhere. He crunches the number of ks in scripts and divides them by three to tally up the KKKs and suspects that people ""speak in some secret white language."" Martin the writer plants some wicked barbs in Hollywoods rear end about creative financing of movies and hoarding of profits the art of the deal hipper-than-thou attitudes and exploitation. When Bowfinger rounds up migrant workers as his crew some viewers are going to be shocked but they need to ride it out. Martin gives it a neat spin. Another target is the embracing of faddish cults in some Hollywood quarters. Ramsey is a true believer in a form of consciousness-raising called Mind Head led by a slick guru in a 3000 suit (Terence Stamp). Ramsey uses the training as therapy and has reached the ""sixth level."" No mention is made of Scientology but it may cross the minds of some viewers. Robert Downey Jr. who has a small role as a high-powered producer had the tough luck to be sent to jail shortly before this picture was released. Its unfortunate not only for Downey but also for the audience which is now going to be distracted every time he appears. But thats showbiz.

Los Angeles - the city the myth the punchline and the nurturer of people who think big even when thinking shallow - is Martins most liberating source of inspiration. And all of his best post-wild-and-crazy-guy movie work as actor and as screenwriter has been in the service of stories that regardless of geography reflect the stubborn mixture of melancholy and hope (A Simple Twist of Faith) jerkdom and poetry (Roxanne) sham and vision (Leap of Faith) conning and dreaming (The Spanish Prisoner) with which Angelenos lead their weather-enhanced lives. L.A. Story Martins funny 1991 valentine made sharp observations about the turf that the writers less Pacifically oriented colleague Woody Allen shuns as the home of the Antichrist. But the film was also a love letter to Martins then wife and costar Victoria Tennant. And shy ardor coated the writers humor like sunscreen blocking all powerful thoughts. Bowfinger on the other hand lets the sun beat down brilliantly on a tapped-out chewed-up schlemiel of a producer-director Bobby Bowfinger as he hustles one last big project that he bets will make him rich - or else hell fail for good. Bobby has been handed an awful script he believes in called Chubby Rain about aliens who infiltrate Earth hidden in raindrops. Hes got a team of associates as marginal as he including an aging stage actress fading from a dim career (Christine Baranski wildly swathed in scarves and sunglasses). With the serendipitous appearance of Daisy (lollypoppet Heather Graham) a Midwestern girlie just off the bus who knows nothing about the movies but who catches on quickly that sex talks so she doesnt have to walk hes got a leading lady. Bobby Bowfinger is a loser; hes also a genius. A nonplussed studio biggie (Robert Downey Jr.) agrees to greenlight the project contingent on Bowfingers smoke-blowing promise to sign up Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy) a superhot action star who worships a crackpot New Age guru (Terence Stamp). Well Bowfinger cant deliver but so what? He shoots Chubby Rain guerrilla- style snaring Ramsay without the celeb ever knowing the cameras rolling. (Acting Martin suggests isnt the point; stardom is.) With the wrong simple twist of fate Bowfinger could have been little more than an amusing Ed Wood construction of balsa and Left Coast sight gags or maybe a minor-league Player. But Martins disciplined script - bitingly funny but tolerant bemused rather than bitter - and the unfogged high beams he turns on everything from Scientology-like fame-friendly creeds to the guileless guile of ambitious starlets is dramatically energized by two essential participants. Frank Oz who for my money has become the preeminent director of perfect mainstream American comedies (from Martins own Dirty Rotten Scoundrels to What About Bob? and In amp; Out) is unbeatable at conveying splintery nonmainstream comic notions (e.g. a teacher who doesnt know hes gay) in a setting Angelenos might say is supportive. Ozs L.A. is a place of real people not cartoons and he gives generous literal visual depth to Martins words. The other key ingredient of course is Eddie Murphy. The great Eddie Murphy whose outstanding comic talent requires more prudent guidance than hes sometimes given or maybe takes. Whichever guru linked Murphy to Martin and Oz then is to be high-fived. Because positioned against Martins vinegary loneliness and paced by Ozs talent for knowing just how long to let a joke go on Murphy is indeed great not only as Kit but also as nerdy hanger-on Jiff - all braces eyeglasses and tragic eagerness - who joins the Bowfinger camp as a coffee fetcher and body double. The sight of Jiff at Bowfingers ruthless command preparing to run across an L.A. freeway speaks a documentarys worth about the insanity and dumb luck involved in moviemaking.

Screenwriter Martins typically quirky and clever premise -- a down-and-out filmmaker surreptitiously shoots a feature toplining a huge star without the actor knowing it -- provides him with an ample clothesline on which to hang innumerable gags and jokes many of which are very funny indeed. But pic is limited by its sketchlike nature and a fundamental lack of grounding in reality. Still the comedy runneth over here which should spell potent late-summer B.O. for this Universal release that is helpfully rated PG-13. Several scenes of explosive hilarity punctuate ""Bowfinger"" a welcome first-time pairing of Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy. Screenwriter Martins typically quirky and clever premise -- a down-and-out filmmaker surreptitiously shoots a feature toplining a huge star without the actor knowing it -- provides him with an ample clothesline on which to hang innumerable gags and jokes many of which are very funny indeed. But pic is limited by its sketchlike nature and a fundamental lack of grounding in reality. Still the comedy runneth over here which should spell potent late-summer B.O. for this Universal release that is helpfully rated PG-13. Although nearly every character here is in the movies or wants to be ""Bowfinger"" is not really a showbiz satire or sendup unlike many looks at the industry nor is it remotely an insiders picture. Naturally the setting allows for a dramatis personae driven by the usual Hollywood traits -- avarice naked ambition unchecked ego and so on -- but the most notable element linking the characters is a sense of self-delusion so highly developed that it allows them to live in something like a state of expectant bliss no matter how desperate their current circumstances. Certainly no one is more delusional than Bobby Bowfinger (Martin) a schlock producer-director who has never made it in Hollywood but at 50 realizes that its now or never. Stimulated by a sci-fi action script called ""Chubby Rain"" penned by his cheerful Iranian accountant Afrim (Adam Alexi-Malle) Bowfinger sets out to make his fortune with this project and in a wonderful scene at Le Dome full of bluff con and bravado actually gets a commitment to the picture from a smarmy studio exec (a droll Robert Downey Jr.) -- if he can deliver the worlds biggest action star Kit Ramsey (Murphy). Bowfinger manages to sneak onto Ramseys estate to deliver the script but is almost as quickly bounced out by the egomaniacal actor who rants and raves at his hapless agent and beefy entourage and is overwhelmed by a paranoia that is partly focused on the white establishment but is mostly driven by a fear of being attacked by aliens. Its the latter that will serve Bowfinger so effectively After he implements his scheme of capturing candid shots of Ramsey in public reacting to the antics of the directors crazed actors Ramsey develops a genuine terror that his nemeses have arrived to torment him. In the slim hope that Bowfinger might yet deliver on his countless promises to them a small and seedy support group helps him out in this shot at the big time although they are kept in the dark about the unknowing nature of Ramseys involvement. Never-has-been actress Carol (Christine Baranski) melodramatically revels in her chance to act opposite such a big name even if she cant understand why her boss wont allow her to meet Ramsey; studio gofer Dave (Jamie Kennedy) keeps Bowfinger supplied with everything from ""borrowed"" equipment and fancy cars to information on Ramseys whereabouts; and handsome slacker actor Slater (Kohl Sudduth) is delighted to participate in auditions for the leading lady who turns out to be Daisy (Heather Graham) a straight-off-the-bus Midwestern waif who systematically sleeps with everyone on the production she thinks is important to her success -- which means everyone. With several ""scenes"" left to shoot the terrorized Ramsey goes into seclusion at the Celebrity Relaxation Center of Mind Head a self-actualization cult presided over by the steely Terry Stricter (Terence Stamp). Bowfinger responds by finding a Ramsey look-alike Jiff (Murphy again) a bashful terminally nerdy fellow with braces and thick glasses whos thrilled to help out. Murphy has been brilliantly brashly funny up till now as the arrogant star but he more than doubles the pleasure once he re-enters the picture as this milquetoast who performs well beyond the call of duty for his director. Most prominent example of Jiffs cooperative attitude comes in a riotous sequence in which Bowfinger asks him to run across eight lanes of speeding freeway traffic with assurances that all the cars are manned by stunt drivers who know whats going on. Superbly filmed and performed convulsive scene is arguably worth the price of admission by itself; still there are several other richly comic episodes including an unsuspecting Ramsey being stalked in a garage by Bowfingers shoe-wearing dog and in a climactic action set piece Ramsey being ""kidnapped"" by the production as a tree-enshrouded crane truck pursues his getaway car. Having collaborated with Martin on three previous occasions director Frank Oz is clearly in tune with his writer-stars sense of humor and the entire cast performs with great verve and comic energy. Weirdest element is Martins title character who seems disconnected from any known reality; unencumbered by any suggested personal history or normal emotions its as if several unsuccessful decades in Hollywood have made him a flipped-out zombie with nothing left but strangely channeled chutzpah. Script and performance impart no special feeling or poignancy to Bowfingers quixotic attempt to take on Hollywood and the way he undertakes it however funny is so lunatic that it creates as much puzzled disbelief as it does carefree delight.
