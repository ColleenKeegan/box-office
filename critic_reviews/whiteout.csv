This one will be too.  US Marshall Carrie Stetko (Kate Beckinsale) fights her way through a blizzard of cliches as she tries to unravel the mysterious death of a geologist found face down on the Antarctic ice. In adapting the graphic novel by Greg Rucka and Steve Lieber screenwriting brothers Jon and Eric Hoeber have employed every cliche in the book the cop with a past the secret buried for fifty years the red herrings that smell a bit funny and the race against time. Winter is about to set in for six months as Carrie wonders who she can trust in this hostile alien landscape - the paranoid knife-wielding geologist the amiable black pilot the handsome but evasive UN investigator? Meanwhile the ice-axe-wielding killer continues to stalk his victims his identity hidden behind dark goggles. John Frizzels over-worked soundtrack keeps telling us how exciting everything is but it feels as if were frozen in time. Not so much a white-out as wipe-out.

"Movie Review AAWhiteout With Kate Beckinsale washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movie Review AAWhiteout With Kate Beckinsale Beckinsale plays a U.S. marshal stationed in Antarctica. Naturally a dead body is found to drive the plotless plot. There is dialogue too. (Warner Bros. Pictures Via Associated Press) Enlarge Photo Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Dan Zak Washington Post Staff Writer Friday September 11 2009 ""Whiteout"" is so staggeringly bad that it achieves a kind of transcendent poetry. Its ignorant of how things are in the real world of what makes a thriller a thriller of why people seek out entertainment. Its a movie made for an irony-free world populated by impaired moviegoers who are amused simply by shapes and sounds and shiny things -- specifically the shape of Kate Beckinsales buttocks the sound of her turning on a hot shower and the gleam of a pickax slicing down at her. All of these things would be welcome in a movie that also has some sense of grace surprise timing character terror and style. ""Whiteout"" has none of these things. A chimpanzee couldve finger-painted a better movie. A chimpanzee somewhere in the world probably has. Attention chimpanzee Send your finger-painted screenplay to Tom Skerritt. Hell sign on for it. He signed up for ""Whiteout"" after all. Beckinsale is Carrie Stetko an all-business U.S. marshal stationed at a South Pole research outpost in Antarctica. Skerritt plays the stations grizzled doctor whom everyone calls (wait for it) ""Doc."" To South Pole rookies Doc dispenses priceless advice like ""never underestimate the ice"" in front of a green-screen backdrop of an Antarctic sunset that looks like it was purchased at a yard sale. Carrie and Doc are reaching the end of a two-year stint at the base but plans change when a mangled frozen body is discovered. The U.S. marshal -- and there really is one stationed there -- finally has some malfeasance to tackle. The discovery of the corpse is the starting point for a plotless bewildering meander underscored by Carries back story which consists of her shooting her crooked partner years earlier. Whenever shes faced with danger in Antarctica Carrie flashes back to that trauma which is laughably rendered in slow motion gauzy light and soft focus. Have the penguins stopped screaming Agent Stetko? All the dialogue in ""Whiteout"" serves solely at the pleasure of the ""plot."" Characters make near-psychic observations of each other to move the story along. Carries forensic abilities are superhuman; she decodes the movies central crime scene within 30 seconds. A slasher film set in Antarctica is a great idea but ""Whiteout"" doesnt count as one because the killer is quashed early on. These days most cheap thrillers however terrible at least go out with a bang. This one whimpers to a close. The only surprise is the sudden appearance of the end credits which arrive before any hint of excitement does. Whiteout (96 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for violence grisly images brief strong language and some nudity.

Comments click to enlarge Whiteout 2009 Shapely but otherwise ungifted Kate Beckinsale (Underworld) is a U.S. marshal racing to solve a series of bloody murders in Antarctica before research facilities there are locked down by six months of polar winter. The crimes have something to do with a downed Soviet cargo plane buried under the ice since the 1950s. The films slick and expensive looking but dumber than a dead penguin and director Dominic Sena fails worst where it counts most in staging intelligible action sequences set in a blinding blizzard. The tepid undermotivated cast is rounded out by Tom Skerritt (the poor mans Kris Kristofferson) Columbus Short (the younger Cuba Gooding Jr.) and Gabriel Macht (a big square-jawed lump of nothing.) 96 min.

"Whiteout movie review by Roger Moore - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Entertainment Entertainment Movie review Whiteout -- 2 out of 5 stars Whiteout Warner Bros. Graphic novel adaptation finds a U.S. marshal (Kate Beckinsale) tracking a killer in Antarctica before six months of darkness sets in. Sept. 11. Graphic novel adaptation finds a U.S. marshal (Kate Beckinsale) tracking a killer in Antarctica before six months of darkness sets in. Sept. 11. (Warner Bros.) Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Whiteout as a movie title might signify the whiter-than-white panties Kate Beckinsale treats us to about five minutes into her new thriller. But it doesnt.It suggests her English rose complexion and the milky white skin she bares in the Obligatory Kate Beckinsale Shower Scene a staple of Kates post-Underworld action films. But not really. What ""whiteout"" refers to in this indifferent thriller based on a grittier comic book is that dark wind-whipped blizzard that can blind you in the worlds snowiest places. ""An unholy set of weather conditions converge and the world falls away"" as Doc (Tom Skerritt) the South Pole vet tells his newbies during their outdoor hypothermia lecture.Its a murder mystery set in that scattering of camps ice stations and bases run by various nations doing climate-change research geology or simple post-Cold War snooping in the Antarctic. We see a Soviet transport plane crash here in the 1950s in an opening scene. Fifty years later scientists are turning up dead. Coincidence? Of course this comes just as the outer bases are about to close down for the long Antarctic night. Naturally theres a blizzard coming making any flight the potential ""last plane out."" And it doesnt need to be said that these are U.S. Marshal Carrie Stetkos last hours on the job. Years of service away from the violence of the ""real"" world -- she has flashbacks about a case that went south on her -- and now she has to figure out whos killing whom and over what. Even those there to help -- the friendly pilot Delphi (Columbus Short) and the under-foot U.N. security specialist (Gabriel Macht) -- are suspects.Director Dominic Sena (Swordfish) and his production designers and digital-image crew cook up polar bases with a crowded subway-corridor ambience -- hustle and parties and street musicians and lots of drinking games. He stages some grim life-or-death chases and fights along the lifelines the ropes that link the outdoor buildings the only things that prevent you from blowing away in a blizzard.What he doesnt do is generate much excitement or mystery. The Greg Rucka/Steve Lieber comic was a bit thin -- but it had suggestions of international intrigue a possibly incompetent cop struggling with a runaway mass-murder case and hints of bisexuality (fanboys and their girl-on-girl fetishes). All are dumped for ""the Hollywood version.""Beckinsale doesnt put a lot of effort into looking weathered wearied and wary in this role. Her character reconstructs crime scenes with unerring skill except when the plot demands that she be too thick to figure out the obvious. The film feels trimmed thanks to scenes and settings that jump about. Macht ( The Spirit) makes no impression. Only Skerritt (Alien MASH) who also seems a bit too groomed to have spent years on the Pole suggests the burden this unique setting might dump on a person. When he gives his little hypothermia speech -- ""Nature not did intend for you to survive out here"" -- the movie gains the credibility that too many scenes lack. For all its frozen blood assaults with ice axes and killer weather Whiteout turns out to be only a pale imitation of the thriller it might have been.

On the plus side she does have a shower scene.       Photo AP The severely nonthrilling thriller ""Whiteout"" moves like winter in Antarctica. Who the flake greenlit this blobby blur? Kate Beckinsale plays a US marshal who specializes in assignments that are deep in fluffy white powder (now Antarctica; previously Miami). Things begin promisingly with an imitation Copacabana-in-""GoodFellas"" tracking shot following her in from the cold at a remote polar research station populated by sprinting nudists hard-core drinkers global-warming researchers and other zanies. The shot culminates with Beckinsale stripping down to take a (chastely photographed) shower and thats a wrap for the excitement this evening folks. The rest is an achy little murder mystery involving a missing band of scientists the mysterious cargo of a Russian plane that went down in 1957 and a whole lot of weather updates. Every few minutes we get a graphic stating that it is for instance minus 55 degrees Celsius at the research station but minus 65 C at an old Russian base yet -- hang on to your hats for this one -- minus 60 C at someplace called ""Camp Delta-One One."" Hey screenwriters -- all four of you Did you skip the first day of writing class the one where they write on the blackboard ""Show dont tell""? If Id wanted weather on the ones I would have stayed home and watched Pat Kiernan. The mystery too isnt so much shown as read aloud like a bedtime story. In between flashbacks about the Really Messed-Up Thing That Happened in Miami Beckinsale keeps reciting what shes gleaned from say a splotch of blood on a locked trunk. It means that a dead dude must have cut his leg open trying to crack it. In the cargo hold of the Russian plane she glances at a corpse and asks ""Why is one of the pilots back here?"" Shes an expert on Soviet military insignia from 1957? This chick belongs on ""Jeopardy"" not Antarctica. Even clunkier than the exposition is the action. Apart from the prefatory shots of the Russian aircraft crashing which looks like it was sketched out on a Commodore 64 computer the action consists of two near-identical chase sequences in which a guy with an ice ax pursues our Beckinsale verry slooowly through a blizzard. Each bundled-up shapeless figure is clinging to a guide rope. Theyre a few feet apart and moving sluglike against the wind as one ducks and the other flails with the ax. The second time around there are three unidentifiable blobs in parkas replaying the same shtick. Another big thrill moment Everyones in a snowcat. The engine wont start Theyre going to be Popsicles So they have a drink and try again. It starts. Later for no reason an innocent guy will run madly away from Beckinsale through the research station. Where does he think hes going? Next stop is Tasmania mate. Wrapping things up with a ""big reveal"" thats as bland as a snow sandwich the bad guy turns out to have the most boring possible motivation and is too drained to even invoke his fundamental villains right to be chased around for a while. I know just how you feel buddy. By the time this thing creaked to a close the look on my face suggested Jack Nicholson at the end of ""The Shining."" kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Susan Boyle comes to US Read Next Susan Boyle comes to US Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 46924 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 19318 16 feared dead in Texas hot air balloon crash 18679 College student kills 3 in house party shooting cops Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Pictures Kate Beckinsale is on the hunt for a killer in extreme weather conditions. Whiteout  (out of four)Stars Kate Beckinsale Tom Skerritt Gabriel Macht Columbus ShortDirector Dominic SenaDistributor Warner Bros.Rating R for violence grisly images brief strong language and some nudityRunning time 1 hour 36 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Being a U.S. Marshal overseeing scientists and other adventurous sorts in Antarctica is like being the mall cop of the tundra. Not all that much happens. But in Whiteout Kate Beckinsales Marshal Carrie Stetko must contend with several grisly murders. Shes chased in bone-chilling wind by a hooded guy with a pickax in temperatures of 55 below zero trapped many feet below the icy surface with waning oxygen. Still her hair always looks perfect -- even after being stuck in a furry cap or parka hood for hours. The unusual setting is definitely the highlight; just about everything else in this action thriller feels rehashed. Fighting for ones life with a killer on the loose in a disorienting South Pole ""whiteout"" sounds like it would be edge-of-your-seat stuff. But the excitement never reaches the expected level. For one thing when visibility is that poor and everyone is in parkas and goggles its nearly impossible to tell the good guys from the bad. But the filmmakers have taken care to ensure that at least the men in the audience sit tight. An early completely gratuitous scene features slow camera pans as Beckinsale peels off heavy clothing down to her blindingly white skivvies en route to the shower. As she lathers up dreamy music swells. Did we mention the story is based on a graphic novel? After a stint of dealing with only misdemeanors Carrie is ready for a transfer back to bigger crimes and warmer climes. But just before shes about to leave a body is found on the barren landscape. As she investigates more murders occur. Antarctica begins to look like the mean streets of New York City. Meanwhile a terrible storm approaches. She is given minutes to decide whether to get on a plane and evacuate to safety and warmth or face another six months stuck in the dark and icy surroundings with only a couple of hot guys for company. One of those hunks is Robert Pryce (Gabriel Macht) a United Nations investigator. Hes been dispatched for murky reasons. Her other companion is known only as Delfy (Columbus Short) a pilot Iraq war vet and all-around good guy. And Tom Skerritt plays a doctor who has been treating frostbite for too long. Like Carrie he is wistful about going home. While the setting can be mesmerizing little else about this movie is captivating. Its a standard-issue thriller with a twist you see coming a continent away. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Reader Editor Brent Jones.

"Whiteout - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-AntarcticaMOVIE REVIEW WhiteoutSeptember 11 2009|Glenn Whipp It doesnt take long for the flashbacks to start piling up for U.S. Marshal Carrie Stetko (Kate Beckinsale) in the anti-mystery movie ""Whiteout."" Now working in Antarctica Marshal Stetko keeps climbing in the wayback machine and remembering her bad old law-enforcement days in Miami where an arrest went awry while bad salsa music played in the background.""Its like its 85 degrees and 85% humidity"" Stetko tells a colleague of the sweaty scenario which may partly explain why in the first 10 minutes of this laughably lame film Beckinsale peels off her clingy white underwear and hops into the shower. More likely though studio suits balked at the idea of Beckinsale bundled up in a parka for the duration of a 100-minute movie. How are you going to sell that?How indeed? Adding to the movies list of dubious virtues is ""Whiteouts"" unrestrained employment of exposition. In this long-gestating committee adaptation of Greg Rucka and Steve Liebers graphic novel no event occurs without a character telling us what were seeing. This unwelcome commentary is so overdone that it becomes by the end an invitation for audience participation. All together now Its a body Looks like its been shot in the headThere are plenty of corpses in ""Whiteout"" most of them belonging to a group of Russian soldiers whose cargo plane crashed in Antarctica half a century ago after an in-flight cold war. The Russkies were killing each other over the mysterious contents of a safe and 50 years later it looks like the killing is going to start all over again under Stetkos watch.Stetko is defined by her undergarments and trust issues and she has plenty of reasons to suspect that the current wave of homicides might be an inside job. Director Dominic Sena (""Swordfish"") telegraphs the culprit almost as quickly as he puts Beckinsale in the shower but Stetko must labor for the movies duration fighting flashbacks and ax-wielding bad guys.The graphic novel used the Antarctic setting to create a sense of bleak despair much like John Carpenter did in his 1982 remake of ""The Thing."" Sena jettisons that hopelessness casting Antarctica (Manitoba fills in for the film) as a winter wonderland though the CG-created southern lights look as awe-inspiring as a tub of Rite Aid rainbow sherbet.No need to worry though ""Whiteout"" helpfully employs a character to tell us just how spectacular those lights are.

Robert Pryce (Gabriel Macht) and Carrie Stetko (Kate Beckinsale) search for clues after geologists go missing at an Antarctica research station. Photo WARNER BROS. PICTURES Whiteout 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Cold climates are a great place for killing people -- have you noticed? If Ive learned anything from movies like A Simple Plan and 30 Days of Night its that blood always looks redder and tackier when it spatters against the virgin snow. Evil cuts deeper with that touch of rime around the edges. Earths polar regions are an especially fine spot for death and destruction. The isolation the extreme weather the sexually frustrated research scientists in puffy coats -- really the list goes on and on. Up at the north pole theres also the possibility of blood-sucking alien plant life (The Thing From Another World). Down at the south pole we have more or less the same thing with parasites (The Thing). In Whiteout a Soviet plane carrying a suspicious metal box and several incredibly stupid Russians (midair is good time for gunfight da?) crashes in Antarctica where it lies buried for 50-ish years until a fresh corpse pops up in its vicinity. Hmmm murder on Antarctica. Hmmm geologists missing from a distant base. Hmmm no penguins anywhere. Instead we have Kate Beckinsale as brow-crinkling U.S. Marshal Carrie Stetko a woman who owns a firearm but never uses it in situations that would seem to require one. Such as for example when shes investigating the corpse-and-geologist business and some crazy jerk comes after her with an ice pick. This prompts cheeseball flashbacks to an arrest gone bad in Miami outfitted for our benefit with overexposed film stock and bopping Cubano background music. Gabriel Macht playing a sensitive U.N. operative talks her through her pain. Director Dominic Sena (Swordfish Kalifornia) and four screenwriters (two sets of brothers Hoeber and Hayes) have adapted Greg Ruckas and Steve Liebers comic-book series with no ear for dialogue no feel for paranoia and no eye for subtlety. Were treated to many glorious vistas -- shot in Canada -- but otherwise the film is all panicky zooms and badly staged action dotted with random forensic gross-outs. And just for the fun of it an amputation scene. One would expect a whiteout in Whiteout especially when Tom Skerritt playing a kindly doc describes it as ""an unholy set of weather conditions"" that doom the unprepared. Fine. But assuming there is one at the climax and assuming everyone involved is blinded by whirling snow how the heck can they see the crazy jerk with the ice pick? How the heck does the crazy jerk see them? And assuming theyre all wearing humongous down parkas with furry hoods and goggles how the heck are we supposed to tell them apart? Or see anything at all in this weather? Or even care? I do have one itsy-bitsy nice thing to say about the movie but it involves a minor spoiler so quit reading now if youd rather not partake. Its this The black guy doesnt die. Hurray When Columbus Short materialized early on as a pilot I instantly tagged him as dead meat --African-American men dont do so well in thrillers -- but I was glad this once to be proven wrong. The black man survived Whiteout and so did I. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Banana Republic Extra 50% off sale items + free shipping w/ 50 Mainstays Sheridan Rug for 7 + pickup at Walmart PUMA Mens Tazon 6 Ripstop Sneakers for 40 + free shipping Mini Portable Washer and Spin Dryer for 90 + free shipping Powered by Contests Enter to win concert tickets airfare and hotel More Entertainment News Rolling Stones Lash Out at Donald Trump (Again) Over Song Use Daveed Diggs Renee Elise Goldsberry to Leave Hamilton Broken Social Scene Working on New Album Steve Young of M/A/R/R/S Pump Up the Volume Fame Dead Calvin Harris Taylor Swift Song Co-Write Questions We Still...

Email| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + In its early scenes ""Whiteout feels like its setting us up for an Antarctic ""Alien. Theres the scientific base far far from civilization; theres Kate Beckinsale nonsensically stripping down to her tighty-whities just like Ellen Ripley; theres something spooky in a box; theres even Tom Skerritt the interstellar captain of ""Alien as Doc sawbones of Camp Amundsen-Scott at the South Pole.At this point the parallels stop cold. Based on a much tauter graphic novel series ""Whiteout is a ham-handed murder mystery that starts out average and heads south from there falling apart under the pressures of graceless camerawork leaps of illogic and TV-movie production values.The setting is novel at least and ""Whiteout fits neatly into the new forensic-pathology chic. Beckinsale plays a US marshal named Carrie Stetko but she could just as well be Dr. ""Bones Brennan for all the ghastly dead bodies she uncovers. The first has apparently been thrown from a plane. The second has his throat cut. Carries very nearly the third.Who is killing the geologists of the Antarctic? It has something to do with the contents of that box buried under the ice in a Russian transport plane that crashed back in 1957. (If youre hoping for something supernatural dont hold your breath.) Carrie investigates with the aid of Doc a raffish pilot (Columbus Short) and a ""special UN investigator played both smugly and woodenly - no mean feat - by Gabriel Macht (""The Spirit).Beckinsale is her usual lovely and brittle self but it says something about this capable British actress that she can go slumming in the funkiest of genre films - the ""Underworld series the tatty motel horror film ""Vacancy - without ever appearing to enjoy herself. Why does Beckinsale keep taking these roles? Thats a greater mystery than anything on the screen.After some decent opening banter and a few interesting tracking shots through the base station ""Whiteout settles into a rut of barely acceptable professionalism. Director Dominic Sena (""Swordfish) fails to combine the films elements into a coherent whole which when you think about it is what directing fundamentally is. Chris Sooss camerawork is overwrought; you cant tell whos doing what to whom during the indoor scenes and forget about the snowstorms. John Frizzells score is strictly hourlong television drama.Worse the characters keep walking into crime scenes and figuring out exactly what happened based on the most tenuous physical evidence; the low point (or high point; take your pick) comes when Carrie accurately reconstructs a complicated gun battle based on a pile of frozen 50-year-old corpses. Theres insight and then theres bad screenwriting.The resolution is especially disappointing; a straight-up B-thriller like this shouldnt make audiences feel like theyve wasted their time. ""Whiteout fritters away its suspense its setting and our indulgence. You come away wishing someone had applied White-Out to the script.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

This one will be too.  US Marshall Carrie Stetko (Kate Beckinsale) fights her way through a blizzard of cliches as she tries to unravel the mysterious death of a geologist found face down on the Antarctic ice. In adapting the graphic novel by Greg Rucka and Steve Lieber screenwriting brothers Jon and Eric Hoeber have employed every cliche in the book the cop with a past the secret buried for fifty years the red herrings that smell a bit funny and the race against time. Winter is about to set in for six months as Carrie wonders who she can trust in this hostile alien landscape - the paranoid knife-wielding geologist the amiable black pilot the handsome but evasive UN investigator? Meanwhile the ice-axe-wielding killer continues to stalk his victims his identity hidden behind dark goggles. John Frizzels over-worked soundtrack keeps telling us how exciting everything is but it feels as if were frozen in time. Not so much a white-out as wipe-out.

(Warner Bros.) . <<1>>Within the first 10 minutes of the glacially paced ""Whiteout""Kate Beckinsale sheds her parka and white underthings to take one of those hilarious cinematic showers in which tufts of steam obscure naughty bits.This scene -- like many in this Antarctica-set travesty -- reveals more about the desperation of the filmmakers than the attraction of Beckinsales lithe bod. That this gratuitous bit serves as the introduction to Beckinsales U.S. Marshal Carrie Stetko hints at the depth of character development one can reasonably expect from ""Whiteout"" a total wipeout that should have been locked in the direct-to-video deep freeze.Director Dominic Sena (""Swordfish"" ""Gone in 60 Seconds"") does wring some suspense from the exotic locale -- with Canada subbing nicely for the real deal -- but he is confounded by a lame screenplay based on a decent graphic novel.On the plus side Beckinsale (of the ""Underworld"" movies) sports a really cute haircut and well thats about it on the plus side.Problems become apparent even before the opening credits with a horrendous CGI prologue in which a Russian cargo plane crashes on Antarctica in the 1940s. Of course the Russians are slugging down bottles of vodka and naturally theres a mysterious locked box aboard with somethin worth killing for inside.Predictability thy name is ""Whiteout.""Advertisement Flash-forward to today and were off to the showers on a base that is a hive of activity as everyone preps to exit for the winter before the ""big storm"" arrives. Stetko and her doctor chum John Fury (Tom Skerritt -- ""Brothers amp; Sisters"" -- who adds little) blather about wanting to return to warmer climes.The discovery of a ""popsicle"" -- a dead body -- in a remote region threatens to upend Stetkos sunny plans and triggers inept flashbacks of an assignment gone awry in Miami. Our tough heroine teams up with a pilot (""Stomp the Yards"" appealing Columbus Short) and eventually heads to a Russian base where she finds a geologist dying on a sofa from a slashed throat -- and an a ice pick-wielding killer in a black parka lurking in the corner.An attractive U.N. representative (a wooden Gabriel Macht) pops in to create some apprehension and romantic tension neither of which is mustered convincingly.But nothing about ""Whiteout"" is convincing let alone involving. Its worst offense is assuming the audience is so dumb that itll be shocked by one of the most telegraphed endings in movie history. On second thought maybe the filmmakers got their wish ""Whiteout"" is shocking shockingly bad.""Whiteout""H Rating R (violence grisly images brief strong language and some nudity)Cast Kate Beckinsale Gabriel Macht Columbus Short and Tom SkerrittDirector Dominic SenaWriter Erich and Jon HoeberRunning time 1 hour 41 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

Whiteout Credibility issues | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesWhiteout Credibility issuesOn the evidence in Whiteout mystery/thriller directors and writers clearly need to be reminded of some basic rules of the genreKate Beckinsale in Whiteout.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Greg QuillBooks ColumnistFri. Sept. 11 2009(out of 4)Starring Kate Beckinsale Tom Skerritt Gabriel Macht Columbus Short. Directed by Dominic Sena. 96 minutes. At major theatres. 18A  MEMO FROM The front officeArticle Continued BelowTO Directors and writers SUBJECT Making a Mystery 101On the evidence in Whiteout mystery/thriller directors and writers clearly need to be reminded of some basic rules of the genreWhen youre setting up your plot in a typically isolated location suited to such dramas - in the case of Whiteout its a U.S. research station near the South Pole a near-perfect location thats loaded with all kinds of potentially scary variables such as storms power failures and according to the advance publicity the remote possibility of a rampaging alien (see The Thing both versions) - its advisable to use the elements at hand to scare your audience and imperil your characters.In Whiteout the destructive forces of sub-arctic nature risibly CGI-generated contribute nothing to the thin plot other than as a looming threat and to provide snow-blown atmosphere for some badly choreographed fight scenes in which its impossible to differentiate the bad guys from the good. Worse this is peculiar weather indeed capable of freezing within seconds scotch spilled in an open doorway and the fingers off the heroine U.S. Marshall Carrie Stetko (Kate Beckinsale) but not the faces of the characters as they dash about the continent trying to solve a rash of ice-pick murders with their features fully exposed. That anomaly doesnt seem to faze even the wise and avuncular camp doctor John Fury (Tom Skerritt) whos anxious to head stateside like the other workers at the station before the onset of a six-month-long winter.Director Dominic Sena and writers Jon Hoeber Erich Hoeber Chad Hayes and Carey Hayes would have been more up on their game had they sought technical advice about extreme meteorological conditions for reasons of credibility if not plot enhancement.There are more important lessons in Whiteout for novice mystery directors however one of which is fundamental to the genres established purpose its only purpose really to keep the audience guessing.To achieve this effect with a small cast in a remote locale its absolutely necessary to give most if not all the characters - except perhaps the investigator - reasons to be guilty. You dont let the chiseled charm of a mysterious UN operative discount him as a suspect almost from the point of his unexplained and sudden appearance. You dont kill off two other likely villains - members of a scientific team who had stumbled on a Russian transport plane buried in the ice since 1957 containing several bullet-riddled bodies and a sinister metal-lined box now empty - before the third act.By eliminating so many suspects before the obligatory drawing-room denouement and final deadly confrontation its a given that the audience will feel cheated when the real bad guy turns out to be the only possible contender.Thats a big no-no. Bigger than stretching your audiences credulity by allowing your heroine - a trained police officer who remains clueless throughout the movie - to crack open sealed stainless steel canisters the missing booty from the mysterious box in the Russian plane with only a passing thought as to what they might contain. Pestilence? A bomb? Radioactive material? Aliens? Well deal with the uses and abuses of science and how to convey credible investigative procedures in the next memo.

Its stunning natural landscape notwithstanding Antarctica-set thriller ""Whiteout"" a frozen concoction of red herrings incongruous plot points and thinly developed characters will leave auds cold. Its tough enough for a female lead to sell an action thriller and not even the ""Underworld"" legions drawn by Kate Beckinsale here playing a U.S. marshal tracking a killer will be able to make up for the chilly reception likely to be afforded this Dominic Sena-helmed pic which should fade faster than a polar bear in a blizzard. Originally published in 2001 Greg Rucka and Steve Liebers taut graphic novel featured the tenacious Marshal Carrie Stetko and blonde British agent Lily Sharpe trying to solve a murder at a South Pole research outpost. The movie which changes some key players and plot points starts with a bang as a Russian plane carrying secret cargo plummets in a spectacular snowy crash. All aboard are killed. Flash forward to the American base that Stetko patrols. But the screen Stetko is far less credible than her tough-as-nails print incarnation. It doesnt help the characters credibility that our introduction to her -- after a lengthy tracking shot setting up the base -- involves a steamy shower scene whose net effect is to remind the (presumably male) audience that the actress is in fantastic shape although Beckinsales near total lack of body fat would arguably render Stetko a dubious candidate for a post in the frozen wilderness. Thats the last bit of visible skin however; Stetko and colleagues spend most of the movie buried under layers of thermals and fleece. Just days away from ending an uneventful two-year stint in Antarctica Stetko snaps into action when a body turns up. Its the first recorded murder in Antarctica and though she apparently cant eye a corpse without reliving (in color-saturated flashbacks) a painfully botched past arrest shes a woman on a mission. But whats curious about Stetkos determination to solve the mystery is that its so at odds with Beckinsales low-key interpretation. Rather than being excited by the chase or driven by an intrinsic need for justice she spouts dialogue that even she doesnt seem to believe. Her presumed motivation -- to expunge the memory of this past blunder -- never really feels authentic. Supporting cast includes Tom Skerritt as Stetkos avuncular pal Dr. John Fury Gabriel Macht as a U.N. official (replacing the graphic novels agent Sharpe) who might also be a love interest; Columbus Short as a spirited airplane pilot and Alex OLoughlin as a sassy Australian. The script credited to two pairs of brothers (Jon amp; Erich Hoeber and Chad amp; Carey Hayes) appears to have been pummeled to the point where some lines inadvertently yielded snickers and groans. Its too bad because on a technical level ""Whiteout"" has its assets. It must have been no picnic filming in tricky conditions against a white-engulfed backdrop (Manitoba convincingly stands in for Antarctica) and Chris Soos lensing makes the territory seem both menacing and beautiful. Wind-whipped action scenes in which characters cling desperately to guide lines as they fight an ice-ax wielding villain are compellingly staged -though composer John Frizzells overwrought score announces every terrifying gesture.

She plays U.S. Marshal Carrie Stetko whos turf is a secluded science base in Antarctica. Joe Neumaier Thursday September 10 2009 303 PM Title Whiteout Theres nothing like watching a half-diverting enjoyably cheesy thriller -- filled with gnawed-on bodies villains in face-obscuring parkas and a mysterious 50-year-old box -- when the terrible truth dawns on youHey this thing doesnt have a monster in it""Whiteout"" contains exactly that experience and as director Dominic Sena (""Gone in 60 Seconds"" ""Swordfish"") puts all of the elements in place the atmosphere and set-up is for a while enough to excuse the silliness and ""Scooby-Doo""-style acting. The action takes place in a secluded science base in Antarctica That box is from a Soviet fighter downed in 1957 But sadly ""Whiteout"" wimps out starting out like ""The Thing"" and winding up like ""CSI South Pole"" wasting whatever it has going for it.Kate Beckinsale is one of those things since here shes playfully bad even stripping down for a soft-core steam-shower introduction. When not enjoying showers her U.S. Marshal Carrie Stetko investigates misdemeanors in were told ""the coldest most isolated land mass on the planet."" Naturally the scientists around her are either fun-loving -- dressing up in Hawaiian garb or streaking through the 70 degree chill -- or suspicious like wizened old Doc (Tom Skerritt) and angry Australian Russell (Alex OLoughlin).When a dead geologist is found in an ice-covered no-mans-land Stetko ignores the blase conclusions of Doc to find that someone is leaving bodies in the snow to protect the contents of a plane that went down under violent circumstances. And she doesnt trust a just-arrived Fed (Gabriel Macht) who has a habit of sneaking around and smirking when he should be serious.Macht is as snowflake-thin as he was in last years ""The Spirit"" though it isnt his fault that when three people wearing parkas fight in a blizzard you cant tell whos who. Skerritt gives a Kris Kristofferson-lite performance and his appearance here is of course a nod to ""Alien."" Yet Beckinsale -- whos made an effort in recent indie dramas to be more than just a beautiful English actress with a penchant for vampire movies -- seems like she wants to let loose but chose the wrong place for it. Amongst all the unrealized claustrophobic tension she seems caught in a less-than-exciting genre switch.In a bad movie no one can hear you scream Kate.

On that watch The first-ever murder in Antarctica.By Tirdad Derakhshani Inquirer Staff WriterPosted September 11 2009Some films feel off from the get-go. They dont hang together despite the best intentions.Whiteout a singularly unsuspenseful unexciting unthrilling Arctic thriller starring Underworlds Kate Beckinsale isnt exactly one of these. Its even worse.Directed with minimal conviction by Dominic Sena (Gone in Sixty Seconds) Whiteout is a wipeout.The film opens with an exciting gunfight in a Soviet cargo plane as it speeds over Antarctica. Its 1957 and the plane is carrying some super-secret super-important and super-mysterious thing - the flicks MacGuffin. The Soviets shoot each other and the plane crashes sinking deep into the ice and snow.Thus begins a treasure hunt for the buried Thingamabob that is supposed to drive the seamlessly plotted story forward to its inexorable conclusion with speed tension and lots of thrills.At least thats whats supposed to happen.Whiteout proper (to use an oxymoron) opens in 2009 at a U.S. scientific camp near the South Pole which is watched over by Beckinsales eagle-eyed swift-acting supercop U.S. Marshal Carrie Stetko.Except that shes not so quick to act. Carrie who was once stationed in warm Miami is haunted by her past. She keeps having flashbacks of being attacked by a slimeball bad guy whom she ended up killing.The filmmakers repeat the Miami footage over and over again lest we dont get it Supercop is t-r-a-u-m-a-t-i-z-ed.Carrie who has spent two years getting over it in the frozen wasteland shares her feelings with the camps doc John Fury (Tom Skerritt in one of his trademark mellow-guy roles).But her world starts to fall apart when a badly mangled body is found in the ice. Its the first-ever murder in Antarctica says United Nations secret agent Robert Pryce (Gabriel Macht) who inexplicably pops up in the story. You know the rest Robert and Carrie team up. They find the Soviet plane. They investigate. Theyre attacked by the bad guy - in the middle of a blizzard.Itll take all day to list all the things that are wrong with Whiteout. Nothing fits. Not the score - we hear vaguely Spanish classical guitar music when Carrie and Robert are buried under 20 feet of ice. Nor the acting - theres no chemistry between Beckinsale and Macht. Nor the plot - which took four screenwriters to contrive.Sure wish someone at Warner Bros. Pictures would have taken the Wite-Out to Whiteout before it ever went into production and saved the company the flicks reported 40 million budget.If you really want some Arctic scares youd do far better renting John Carpenters beautifully gory The Thing; the vicious vampire flick 30 Days of Night; or Larry Fessendens brilliant enviro-thriller The Last Winter. Each cost a fraction of what Warner sank into this disaster.Contact staff writer Tirdad Derakhshani at 215-854-2736 or tirdadphillynews.com.

Posted September 15 2009 -- 1200 AM EDT How cold is it in Antarctica? Cold enough for hands to freeze -- but lips to remain kissing soft. Or at least thats the bad news/good news for Kate Beckinsale as a comely U.S. marshal at an ice-encrusted American research station investigating a homicide when not battling flashbacks of Something Bad that once happened to her in Miami. Whiteout is a conventionally jam-packed dutifully ludicrous action thriller based on a graphic novel which features the lithe marshal in a steamy shower and a chase scene in zero-degree visibility (the bad guy wields a scary pickax). As a bonus a team of screenwriters devised a prologue involving those sturdiest of menaces -- 1950s-style Russians swigging vodka. Ah but are they merely red herrings?

Share Tweet Throughout Whiteout--an Antarctica-based thriller based on a Greg Rucka-penned comics series--its generally pretty easy to tell when the four-man screenwriting team thinks the plot makes sense because they spell it out in vast detail not trusting their viewers to follow along. Onscreen text unnecessarily explains that Antarctica is the coldest most isolated place on earth. Characters pointedly explain things that everyone in the room can see. Flashbacks repeat events that just happened for anyone who missed them. But when the plot gets openly ridiculous--say when protagonist Kate Beckinsale glances around a complicated crime scene blurred by decades of accumulated rime and frost and instantly deduces everything that happened there in unerring detail the film whisks forward as if embarrassed and eager to sweep the story under the rug. Which is too bad because Whiteouts intriguing setting and storyline would be gripping if Beckinsales Sherlocking around wasnt so glossed-over or alternately spoon-fed to the audience. Presented with a frozen mangled corpse--Antarcticas very first murder victim--U.S. Marshal Beckinsale has to unravel the mystery before most of her suspects evacuate the continent as the long polar winter begins. Horrific weather and lethal temperatures make travel around the local outposts as hazardous as in any outer-space thriller. Bodies pile up and the arrival of suspicious-acting outsider Gabriel Macht (star of the misbegotten comics adaptation The Spirit) complicates the investigation. With Beckinsale simultaneously battling man and nature theres some serious potential for a moody psychological thriller in the vein of the original Insomnia or at least a scary environment-aided horror film like The Thing. But director Dominic Sena who normally deals in visually dynamic broad action (in Swordfish and Gone In Sixty Seconds for instance) rarely seems to know what to do with his claustrophobic interior settings and threatening darkness and he only once uses them to real advantage. The exterior sequences are vivid by comparison but while he makes whiteout conditions look terrifying they hinder viewers almost as much as the characters; the inevitable big showdown is a visual muddle of thickly blowing snow and identical-looking people in parkas battling over identical-looking safety lines. Briefly not knowing who has the upper hand is exciting but as the fight wears on it becomes irritating. Then again the way the rest of the story goes were probably lucky Beckinsale doesnt narrate the whole thing to make sure we dont misinterpret a moment.
