Coens dont hit paydirt this time around although presence of that B.O. Mr. Reliable Tom Hanks at the top of the cast will get pic off to a good commercial start. Overseas film is due to kick off Cannes. The souffle falls a little flat in ""The Ladykillers"" a Coen brothers black comedy in which the humor seems arch and narrative momentum doesnt kick in until the final third. Returning to the Deep South for the first time since ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" their biggest domestic hit the Coens dont hit paydirt this time around although presence of that B.O. Mr. Reliable Tom Hanks at the top of the cast will get pic off to a good commercial start March 26. Overseas where the Coens latest ""Intolerable Cruelty"" more than doubled its domestic haul film is due to kick off at the Cannes Film Festival in May. It wasnt necessarily a bad idea to try to remake the wry 1955 Ealing comedy written by William Rose and directed by Alexander Mackendrick about an odd gang of robbers who hole up in the home of a little old lady while executing their scheme. And there would seem to be plenty of promise in the Coens decision to transplant the yarn to small-town Mississippi and turn the lady into a not so little black Baptist widow with a strong nose for immorality. But after a nifty opening scene in which Marva Munson (Irma P. Hall) marches into the sleepy local police station to complain about the ""hippity-hop"" music a neighbor is playing on his new blaster the films tone shortly begins to feel off -- a sense setting in that in this instance the brothers stylized dialogue isnt quite hitting the accustomed high mark. Introducing himself as a classics professor with expertise in Latin and Ancient Greek Goldthwait Higginson Dorr Ph.D. (Hanks) is as eccentric and as highfalutin as his name. Goateed and bedecked with a permanent bow-tie and creamy caped suit that mark him as a man steeped in a distant age Dorr speaks in an elaborate rarified highly literary manner that gives Hanks paragraphs of dialogue to recite and is not unamusing if you follow its circumlocutions carefully. Dorr takes a room in Marvas comfortable old house but spends most of his time in the cellar with an ""ensemble"" that supposedly specializes in playing ""late Renaissance"" music. In fact this is Dorrs criminal band and the Coens (Ethan explicitly shares directorial credit with Joel here for the first time) devote considerable attention and invention to providing each member with his own mirthful intro. Gawain (Marlon Wayans) is the streetwise vulgarity-spewing ""inside man"" who takes a janitorial job aboard a floating casino; Pancake (J.K. Simmons) is a hapless technician assigned to setting the explosives for the break-in; Lump (Ryan Hurst) is the inarticulate ""muscle"" responsible for digging a tunnel from Marvas basement to the casino office and the General (Tzi Ma) is a former South Vietnamese officer whose logistical expertise supposedly makes up for his lack of words. With so much time spent on bringing the characters into the mix and covering the tracks of their project -- with time out for visits to Marvas church for no other reason than to sample the lusty gospel singing -- ""The Ladykillers"" has trouble gathering dramatic momentum reducing it to the level of a picaresque Southern curio. Gangs successful completion of its mission comes at the one-hour mark and Dorr characteristically celebrates the occasion with his own variation on a famous speech from Shakespeares ""Henry V."" From then on however its nothing but trouble for the quintet as Marva discovers the truth forcing Dorr after much verbal tap-dancing to offer her a full share of the 1.6 million haul. Its when the righteous Marva refuses the bribe that pics title comes into focus with results that backfire in a manner that will be familiar to anyone whos seen the 49-year-old British gem. The original was centered upon one of Alec Guinness most breathtakingly eccentric performances one marked physically by the characters outrageously bad teeth. In a return to comedy after a considerable sabbatical Hanks comports himself skillfully obviously relishing Dorrs distinctive oddities and rhetorical flights and putting his own trademark on the role with an irrepressible giggle that overcomes him at peak moments of enthusiasm. But like the film itself the performance doesnt take off and soar and there are moments when Dorrs long-windedness frankly becomes tiresome. Part of the films problem may stem from the characters wildly different manners of speech and from the fact that they simply dont mesh. Contrasting with Dorrs windy courtly manner are Gawains impudent obscenity-laced urbanspeak Pancakes straight-laced professionalese Lumps inexpressive grunting and the Generals loaded minimalism. Preston Sturges a Hollywood standard-bearer when it comes to creating distinctive voices for characters -- and one of the Coens heroes -- could stir this sort of stew but the brothers dont entirely manage it this time. And then theres Marva. Rightly written to be sharper and more of a stand-up character than Katie Johnsons Mrs. Wilberforce in the original she is initially presented as the sort of obstinate mama whos not about to take no guff from no one. Marva still living in the shadow of her late husband whose portrait constantly peers down at her from the living room wall recedes a bit when she allows the wool to be pulled over her eyes only to emerge again in the late-going. Hall makes the woman constantly engaging even if she only reaches the peak of comic outrage when she gives the smart-mouthed Gawain some convincing wallops upside the head. Production values are up to the Coens usual impeccable standards. Roger Deakins lensing is exquisitely composed and atmospheric especially in his shots of a statue-laden bridge that comes to play a crucial role in the proceedings. Carter Burwells original score takes a back seat to the extensive gospel selections that grace the soundtrack albeit to less decisive and organic effect than the music selections played in ""O Brother.""

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.March 26 2004 605 PM Thieves Like Us The Ladykillers a slick Southern caper from the Coen Bros. By David Edelstein A Southern romp Interviewing Joel and Ethan Coen during the making of their hilarious sophomore feature Raising Arizona (1987) I made the silly mistake of pressing the brothers on their attraction to the subject of the movie--the obsession of a young couple with having a baby even if it meant kidnapping one of a celebrated family of quintuplets on the grounds that the parents had four more. I wanted to hear them talk about ... oh I dont know infertility childrearing topsy-turvy American family values. We were sitting in a Greek coffee shop and they were smoking heavily and as they stared at me dumbly doing their best in the face of so irrelevant a question it was as if wed drifted out to sea in a thick fog. Finally Joel spoke as if to a small child ""A babys face ... is fodder right? Its movie fodder. People have certain expectations of a babys face in a movie and we wanted to play with those expectations."" Play with them as in setting that gurgly happy baby face on the center line of a blacktop with a truck bearing down on it at 70 miles an hour. Later their friend Barry Sonnenfeld put the matter in perspective. Topics and themes he explained are incredibly unimportant to the Coens. Its about movie storytelling in the abstract--i.e. fooling around with fodder. It became easier for me to love the Coens when I accepted that their films were about little except toying (brilliantly) with found objects. My favorite of their movies might be their most inconsequential the grab-bag stoner travesty of gumshoe mysteries The Big Lebowski (1998). And I had a surprisingly decent time at their big-studio remake of the 1955 Alec Guinness black comedy The Ladykillers (Touchstone) which is about nothing except transplanting a low-key British caper farce to rural Mississippi with an old African-American woman at the center instead of a middle-class English biddy. It gives the Coens a chance to stage some rousing gospel numbers that have nothing to do with the plot (and T-Bone Burnett a chance to put together another soundtrack on the order of his multiplatinum O Brother Where Art Thou?) and Tom Hanks a chance to ditch his socially-responsible-movie-star persona for a spell and attempt a full-scale comic impersonation. Advertisement He succeeds by the way--with gorgeous precision. As the would-be criminal mastermind Professor G.H. Dorr Hanks presents himself at the lodgings of Mrs. Marva Munson (Irma P. Hall) in a caped overcoat clutching a polished walking stick the image of a dapper Southern academic apart from a set of teeth a size too big for his mouth and an unfortunate snorting cackle that pegs him instantly as a ghoulish nerd. The team that the Professor assembles (posing as an antique-instruments baroque ensemble) is a perfect mixture of artistry and incompetence--guaranteed to screw up somehow but not so bumbling that the scheme to rob a riverboat casino is without suspense. Marlon Wayans is the ""inside man"" with the chip on his shoulder for having to pose as a janitor; J.K. Simmons is the demolitions expert for whom safety comes second only to holding forth on the subject of safety; Tzi Ma is the former Vietnamese general with the smoldering butt affixed permanently to his lips; and Ryan Hurst is the muscle whos a bit of a lump as suggested by his name Lump. The challenge that the Coens have clearly set for themselves is to make these guys triumph--and crash-and-burn--in ways you cant predict even if youve seen the 50s original. The brothers make Irma P. Hall--a veteran of films like Soul Food (1997)--seem like the most spectacular found object a formal elegant old woman determinedly striding through the world on bowed legs her immense body sloshing like a water balloon. But Halls timing is too masterful for a found object. The Coens clearly worship her along with her posse of old ladies who live for church in their Sunday best and the tea parties that follow. They have the kind of solidity that the stumblebum criminals cant touch. The mixture of cartoony stylization and regional realism is completely original--and a testament to the genius eye for color of the great cinematographer Roger Deakins and the designer Dennis Gassner. The Ladykillers loses its distinctive lumbering gait during the final Rube-Goldberg series of macabre catastrophes but the movie has plenty of compensations an account of a singles weekend at Grossingers for sufferers of irritable bowel syndrome; a spooky cat that keeps coming back for more grotesque punch lines; and that joyous soundtrack with live church gospels led by Rose Stone (of Sly and the Family fame). The highlight of The Ladykillers is a bit of musical trickery an amazing montage in which a baroque concerto metamorphoses into a gospel song which segues into a hip-hop number then back to the gospel and then back to baroque. During the hip-hop sections the thieves drop bags of dirt over the side of an impressive bridge onto a passing garbage barge headed out to a Mount Olympian isle of trash. The bags fall a long way and land with a satisfying pffft--like the sacks of stolen Christmas toys in Chuck Jones cartoon of How the Grinch Stole Christmas. The Ladykillers is small and compact--it doesnt kill its just a doodle--but its a very pleasant cartoon for grown-ups. Its some sweet fodder. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Ryan Hurst Tom Hanks J.K. Simmons and Tzi Ma are a goofy band of crooks in a remake of 1955s The Ladykillers. Buena Vista Pictures The setting is a sleepy Mississippi town where a quintet of hapless crooks intends to rob the vault of a riverboat casino. The heist is masterminded by Tom Hanks as Goldthwait Higginson Dorr Ph.D. an erudite Southern gent ""trained in the arts of cogitation."" The phony professor dresses more like Mark Twain -- complete with 19th-century-style three-piece suit bow tie and cape -- than a scholar. With his snuffly panting laugh and his anachronistic oratorical style Hanks creates one of the years most amusing screen characters. The professor and his motley crew assemble in the root cellar of a house belonging to kindly churchgoing Mrs. Munson (Irma P. Hall) from whom Dorr has rented a room. She is charmed when he tells her he heads an ensemble of chamber musicians who play ""church music"" on period instruments. What her cellar actually provides is a place from which to tunnel into the on-shore vault of the casino. We wont give away the denouement but Munson proves ""a more formidable antagonist than Id imagined"" Dorr laments. ABOUT THE MOVIE Ladykillers    (out of four) Stars Tom Hanks Irma P. Hall Marlon Wayans J.K. Simmons Director Joel and Ethan Coen Distributor Touchstone Pictures Rating R for language including sexual references Opens Friday nationwide Joel and Ethan Coen have fashioned a darkly funny -- though not brilliant -- update of the original 1955 Ladykillers with some of their trademark oddball touches. This is closer to the inspired offbeat humor of O Brother Where Art Thou? than to their more recent and more mediocre efforts Intolerable Cruelty or The Man Who Wasnt There. The comedy is broad but effectively carried out. Halls Mrs. Munson speaks in reverential tones about her dear departed husband and sits under his august portrait while knitting or thinking about the Lord. As the caper gets underway we see her husbands face shift to look disapproving righteous or smug depending on the turn of events. Its an obvious gag but it keeps working. Hall plays her role with robust flair and Marlon Wayans as the inside man/janitor is a hoot. But it is Hanks pitch-perfect timing and eccentric portrayal that make the movie. You cant wait to hear what sardonically archaic utterance comes out of his mouth next. ""We must all have waffles forthwith"" he remarks to a waitress at a pancake joint. ""I gather there was a premature detonation"" he says in an attempt to explain an explosion coming from the old ladys root cellar. When Mrs. Munson catches the mischief makers in the midst of their ""criminal enterprise"" and tells them shes surprised the professor counters ""No madam technically speaking we are surprised. You are taken aback."" Those seeking a quirky and clever comedy should hightail it to The Ladykillers forthwith.

Starring Tom Hanks and Irma P. Hall. Written and directed by the Coen Brothers. (R. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) To look at the people in ""The Ladykillers"" -- especially Tom Hanks who goes through the movie dressed like a Kentucky colonel talking like an Edgar Allan Poe character and cackling like Joan Cusack after five drinks -- one cant help but suspect that the actors considered this film absolutely hilarious. But factor in the audience and that becomes a minority opinion. This latest from the Coen brothers a remake of the 1955 British comedy of the same name moves the storys original setting from urban Britain to rural Mississippi. Using the original film as a loose template the filmmakers try ramping up the energy and the laughs scene by scene. And heres whats strange Though the Coens creative invention is evident in these changes the results are lackluster without unity of purpose or inspiration. The film never settles into an assured rhythm and instead the actors always seem to be pushing putting the hard sell on an audience that however distracted by the strenuousness of the sales pitch still isnt buying. Like the original which starred Alec Guinness ""The Ladykillers"" is about a gang of thieves who hide out in an old ladys boarding house planning a caper under the pretense of being a classical string ensemble. While the British film had Katie Johnson a prototypical sweet old lady the new film stars the more robust Irma P. Hall as Mrs. Munson a black Baptist church lady who detests ""hippity-hop"" music and brooks no nonsense. Hanks plays Professor Dorr a criminal mastermind whose speech is pure Southern gothic full of curlicues of tortured syntax. For the role Hanks sports the hair of an 1840s plantation dandy a Van Dyke beard and a set of goofy teeth. The professor rents a room in Mrs. Munsons home and gets permission to rehearse his quintet in the basement. In fact he plans to dig a tunnel from the basement across the silt of a river bed all the way into the locked safe inside a gambling boat. The Coens introduce each member of the professors team with fanfare -- a separate scene to show why each needs money and why each is funny at least in theory. Theres the all-but silent character of ""the General"" (Tzi Ma) and a painfully stupid football player named Lump (Ryan Hurst) the group strongman. Neither does much. But Marlon Wayans as a foul-mouthed waiter (the inside man on the gambling boat) and J.K. Simmons as Garth the demolitions expert do some comic heavy lifting. Their instant mutual antipathy is good for a few laughs. Each time the group is supposedly rehearsing the professor puts on the same recording -- Boccherinis minuet from his string quintet in E Major (a piece everyone knows even those who think they dont). As in the original ""Ladykillers"" something about the repetition of this highly refined piece in this vulgar context becomes funny. This is the one intact holdover from the 1955 version and it gives an indication of the more delicate precise tone of the earlier films humor. The Coens replace that tone with jokes about Irritable Bowel Syndrome. While Hall is steady as a rock comic but believable in her moral strength the rest of the cast seems either to be flailing or posing. Hanks is amusing as Dorr only to the extent that the phenomenon of Hanks as Dorr is amusing -- check out Hanks hair teeth giddy laugh etc. His character work looks like character work not like a person. The same could be said for the rest of the cast save Munson. Theyre flapping their arms with all their might but the comedy isnt flying. Obviously the Coen brothers could be blamed for all of this and yet some movies arent really anybodys fault. Some movies just dont need to get made -- but the only way to find out is to make them. -- Advisory This film contains strong language suggested violence and sexual references.

The Ladykillers Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2004) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-ladykillers-2004,200,theladykillers9,theladykillers,rogerebert
"Coen brothers Ladykillers is loose silly but nothing new - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Coen brothers Ladykillers is loose silly but nothing new By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  March 26 2004 Once upon a time there was a classic British heist comedy called ""The Ladykillers"" starring Alec Guinness and a very young Peter Sellers and it was good. Then there came upon the land the brothers Coen Joel and Ethan and they said yea we do not give a [expletive] for the original for it is old and our audiences are young and hip.And so they cast Tom Hanks and gave unto him a funny hairdo and said Go be our effete leader in criminal enterprise round up your motley crew stretch your character-acting skills. And they cast Irma P. Hall as the Bible-thumping landlady who becomes a monkey wrench in the gangs carefully laid plans and they cast too Marlon who is of the tribe of Wayans and other funny men and said Make for us much merriment for yea we could sorely use a hit after ""Intolerable Cruelty.""And the movie was once again called ""The Ladykillers"" and this time it was . . . OK.In point of fact ""The Ladykillers"" is the loosest silliest broadest thing the Coens have yet committed to celluloid and that includes ""Raising Arizona"" one of this critics favorites. If you set your expectations low enough there are real laughs to be had but coming to the Coens with low expectations somehow just feels wrong and the parts of the movie that feel right are the parts theyve done before.Except for the redoubtable Hall and except for Hanks who finally rips off his itchy Jimmy Stewart suit and dives into the role of Professor Goldthwait Higginson Dorr PhD a criminal mastermind who oozes fraudulent Southern gentility from every pore. Hanks gives the man a great nervous whinny of a laugh and revels in his love for Edgar Allan Poe quoting from ""To Helen"" whenever opportunity presents and wiping away a tear when he gets to the bit about ""the weary way-worn wanderer born to his native shore.""In short Dorrs not the sort to tunnel from his landladys basement to the counting house of the Bandit Queen a gambling steamship anchored in the nearby Mississippi. He needs a crew and so enlists ex-Viet Cong tunnel expert the General (Tzi Ma) demolitions ace Garth Pancake (J.K. Simmons) ""inside man"" and self-confessed booty hound Gawain MacSam (Wayans) and Lump (Ryan Hurst) whom we see taking a few too many hits to the head during football games early on (nice helmet-cam there) and who is now in Dorrs words ""a hooligan a goon an ape -- our blunt instrument.""All they have to do is dig from point A to point B while convincing Marva Munson (Hall) the sweet little old church lady who owns the house that theyre actually musicians specializing in late Renaissance chamber pieces. Later on more murderous designs are made.The plans dont go off without a hitch but if youve seen the 1955 original (and you really should someday) you already know that. The fun is or should be precisely in the way the enterprise doesnt work but this being the Coens its more amusing just watching the five men knock heads. Its not even that theyre different types -- the ludicrously refined Dorr macho Pancake and potty-mouthed homeboy Gawain seem as if theyre from different centuries.What keeps ""The Ladykillers"" from rising above the level of minor entertainment is cheap jokes and overfamiliarity (not to mention some sloppy plotting toward the end). Pancake it turns out suffers from Irritable Bowel Syndrome which bien sur burbles up when least wanted. The Coens even recycle the old portrait-with-the-changing-expression gag from ""Sullivans Travels"" -- it was cartoon humor in 1941 and feels even more inane now.But then the brothers borrowed the title of their 2000 film ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" from ""Travels"" too and meticulously planned crimes went amok in their first film ""Blood Simple"" and their best ""Fargo."" Hankss Dorr is another of their hyperarticulate loser-heroes on the order of George Clooneys Ulysses McGill in ""O Brother.""

Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; ladykillers-the ) Ladykillers The (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli The Ladykillers is an interesting concoction - a faithful update of the original Ealing comedy cooked in vat of Coen Brothers seasoning. Even though this is based on the 1955 British film of the same name those unfamiliar with The Ladykillers pedigree might mistake it for an original. Its an understandable error - The Ladykillers is at home with certain other Coen Brothers titles namely Raising Arizona The Hudsucker Proxy The Big Lebowski and Intolerable Cruelty. Although the plot closely tracks that of Alexander Mackendricks original many of the nuances not to mention the funniest jokes are pure Joel amp; Ethan Coen. With The Ladykillers as with Intolerable Cruelty the Coens flirt with mainstream acceptability without sacrificing their trademark quirkiness. The participation of Tom Hanks virtually guarantees that this will be the most widely seen of the brothers eleven features. Yet despite this theres no sense of compromise. Not only is this the darkest of comedies but it gets laughs from some unexpected sources. And as in The Hudsucker Proxy and Intolerable Cruelty theres one explosive burst-out-laughing gag. A word about the original is perhaps in order. I have a fondness for the original The Ladykillers. Like Big Deal on Madonna Street it turns the caper movie into a farce. The 1955 version is nicely written by William Rose and has lost none of its zip during the half-century that has passed since its original release. It stars Alec Guinness Cecil Parker Herbert Lom and Peter Sellers (the latter two in their pre-Pink Panther days). It was the final comedy made at Ealing Green Studios before the place was bought by the BBC and along with Kind Hearts and Coronets is viewed as one of the blackest of the Ealing comedies. The Coens admiration of the film is obvious from their treatment of it in this re-imagination. The setting has been transplanted from London to the tiny southern town of Saucier a lazy locale that plays host to a riverboat casino. Silver-tongued Poe-quoting Professor G.H. Dorr (Hanks) arrives in Saucier with the express purpose of robbing that casino. He has assembled a diverse gang that includes Garth Pancake (J.K. Simmons) an explosives expert with a bad case of Irritable Bowel Syndrome; Gawain MacSam (Marlon Wayans) the ""inside man"" who works as a janitor on the boat; The General (Tzi Ma) a cold conscienceless killer who says little; and Lump Hudson (Ryan Hurst) the ""muscle."" For their base of operation the Professor chooses the house of an elderly widow named Marva Munson (Irma P. Hall) who has a room to rent. He claims that he and his friends will be practicing sacred music in her root cellar when in fact they are digging a long tunnel. The Ladykillers is divided into three easily recognizable parts. The first introduces the characters. The Professor a living portrait of the perfect Southern gentleman moves into Marvas house. For Gawain its another day on the job. The General foils a would-be hold-up at his convenience store. Garths special effects work on a TV commercial goes awry (he kills the canine star of a dog food spot). And Lump has an unspectacular outing on the football field (all of which is shown from his point-of-view). The second act concerns the caper which is straightforward and played primarily for laughs (The Ladykillers should not be confused with a traditional crime movie). Finally the third half-hour represents the meat of the story and relates what happens after the deed has been done. Although Tom Hanks takes top billing this is an ensemble effort. Hanks work is laudable - he plays a suave genteel man with a smooth manner and a laugh that sounds like an asthmatic hyena - but he is upstaged by Irma P. Hall (probably best known as ""Big Mama"" in Soul Food) who steals the movie as Marva. This isnt by accident. Hanks recognizes his place and inhabits it gracefully. Hall has the most biting one-liners and many of the best bits of physical comedy. (Her repeated slapping of Marlon Wayans is a highlight and its not done so often that it becomes overused.) Everyone else is given a moment in the spotlight but any time Hall is on screen our attention is focused on her. Is appreciation of The Ladykillers relegated to those who enjoy the Coens non-traditional approach to movies? Perhaps - the comedy is at times too dark and edgy for multiplex viewers in search of something frothy and romantic. And Tom Hanks isnt playing the nicest guy on Earth. But perhaps because I have a somewhat warped sense of humor I laughed more heartily during The Ladykillers than during anything since the Coens last effort Intolerable Cruelty. I suspect that mainstream audiences will find plenty of things to take pleasure in even though some viewers may be bewildered by what the Coens do. But for those who share my taste in comedy this is a must-not-miss. Ladykillers The (United States 2004) Director Joel Coen amp; Ethan Coen Cast Tom Hanks Irma P. Hall Marlon Wayans J.K.

Both turn up in Millennium Mambo a ravishing bauble about la dolce vita in Taiwan but frankly the guns an afterthought. This is a movie about the girl. Set in and around Taipeis hippest nightclubs its a dreamy drift of a story about Vicky (Shu Qi) a self-absorbed party girl and hostess-bar employee who bounces between two men her doper boyfriend Hao-Hao (Tuan Chun-Hao) a petty thief and would-be DJ; and a calm older gangster named Jack (Jack Kao) who makes her feel safe. Devoted to an anomie no more purposeful for being frenzied Vicky spends her days guzzling whiskey smoking enough cigarettes to outpollute an oil refinery and obeying the rhythms of a techno beat that keeps her from hearing the fragile flutterings of her own heart. More an appendage than a full-fledged person shes caught up in a dance of attachment and loneliness intoxication and sobriety that takes her nowhere. Normally this kind of alienated-youth picture would have me bolting from the theater faster than an outbreak of Ebola. But Millennium Mambo was directed by Hou Hsiao-Hsien the great chronicler of modern Taiwan who to my mind has been the worlds greatest filmmaker for the past 20 years. His previous movie Flowers of Shanghai was a masterpiece -- as beautiful as a Vermeer as oblique as a Henry James novel -- about courtesans struggling to win whatever little freedom they could within the lethally narrow confines of the social order in 19th-century China. Although slighter Millennium Mambo can be seen as a modern companion piece to Flowers. Like those courtesans Vicky too is trapped. But shes also a prisoner of her own vacant narcissism and aimless freedom. In Hous vision shes an avatar of the new consumerist Taiwan -- radiant and enticing and only dimly aware of its own shallowness. The movie was shot by In the Mood for Loves Mark Lee Ping-Bing whose lighting most Hollywood stars would kill for. He transforms Vickys world into a symphony of dark rooms graced by swathes of orange and yellow that give her flesh a wondrous glow. Hou has the great filmmakers knack for taking the banal and then reinventing it -- he can turn his heroines romp in the snow into a moment of transcendence. Millennium Mambo begins with the camera following Vicky as she walks blithely through a seedy overpass in nighttime Taipei the taillights of passing cars tattooing the darkness. Although the setting could hardly be less glamorous or the action more ordinary Hou endows this shot with such thrilling poetry that when this carefree young woman finally bounds down the overpass stairs and away from our eager eyes we feel ourselves inexorably descending into a less buoyant emotional realm.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm While Millennium Mambos stylistic brilliance alone would make it worth seeing I cant deny that its somewhat tedious. By my reckoning Hou has made at least 10 better movies and it underscores a daunting truth about American film culture that it is only the first of his works to receive nationwide distribution. This one wouldnt have been distributed either were it not for Shu Qi. Full-lipped and luminous she isnt merely one of the worlds most beautiful actresses but an international erotic icon whose youthful nude photos have been downloaded onto many millions of computers. Its too early to tell how far she can go as an actress -- Hong Kong filmmakers have generally exploited her beauty rather than nourishing her talent -- but here as in Viva Erotica Shu hints at a core of melancholy that along with her surface fizz suggests she has it in her to be an Asian Marilyn Monroe. Hou seems to think so. From the first frame to the last he follows her movements with a lovers eye -- and finds grace in her every gesture. THE CAMERA IS ALMOST as generous to Siyabonga Melongisi Shibe the star of James Journey to Jerusalem an enjoyable sneaky-smart fable about the collision between innocence and experience. The open-faced South African actor plays James a Christian Candide who leaves his Zulu village to visit Jerusalem before becoming a minister. But upon reaching Israel hes instantly tossed in the Tel Aviv slammer and is rescued so to speak by a contractor Shimi (Simon Daw) who gets him out of jail houses him with other migrants and puts him to work doing manual labor. James soon winds up working for Shimis curmudgeonly father Sallah (Arie Elias) an old-school Israeli settler who refuses to sell his ramshackle house so that the property can be turned into one of the soulless apartment blocks that increasingly dot the Israeli landscape. Hed rather have a garden. The old man keeps warning the young African not to be a frayer -- a Hebrew word for ""patsy"" -- and James proves an apt pupil gradually learning the rules of a society where everybody has an angle. The movie is the feature debut of director Raanan Alexandrowicz who co-wrote the script with Sami Duenias. He gives us an Israel thats a ""godforsaken country"" as one soldier terms it. Dusty messy and casually racist -- James is called ""Blackie"" even by those who like him -- its a Holy Land caught up in an exploitative logic thats a far cry from the ideals that created it. Here milk and honey have become cell phones and real estate and you get them by profiting from other peoples labor. To emphasize the point Alexandrowicz gives Tel Aviv a nasty smeary look as if it had been shot on waxed paper that had once held a particularly greasy falafel. Naturally nothing about the films moral lesson is specific to Israel. On the contrary characters like James have become a staple of modern filmmaking be it the honorable Nigerian doctor caught up in an organs scam in Dirty Pretty Things the sweet Latino gigolo in Star Maps or the good-hearted small-town kids in Hou Hsiao-Hsiens earlier classics Boys From Fengkuei and Dust in the Wind. All these decent souls taste the poison apple of modernity and know that the folks back home -- like James fellow villagers in Africa -- wont understand that our present-day Jerusalems are far less holy than they used to be.

Rather than merely copy old movies theyve taken them as the starting point for jokey fractured riffs on the idea of noir romantic comedy or Capra corn. Until now. Their misshapen new movie The Ladykillers is based on the 1955 Ealing Studios classic about London thieves led by scary Alec Guinness who use a clueless old womans house as a base of operations for a robbery. Such a wicked storyline seems right up the brothers alley and at first you may think theyre pulling it off. They neatly transpose the action to the South and turn the old woman into a devout African-American church lady (Irma P. Hall). Better still they unleash Tom Hanks a terrific comic actor who -- after playing the Noble American for the past few years -- relishes the chance to ham it up. Sporting goofy fake teeth he plays the bearded white-suited Goldthwait Higginson Dorr Ph.D. a mountebank who speaks with amusingly old-fashioned grandiloquence punctuating his words with a rapid air-sucking laugh. Hes surrounded by a band of crooked brothers including a muscle-bound dolt (Ryan Hurst) a brutally efficient Asian with a Hitler mustache (Tzi Ma) and a sassy black dude who cant stop saying ""motherfucker"" (Marlon Wayans). (Having demonstrated their mastery of insensitively portraying Jews the Coens have moved on heroically to African-Americans.) Its the disease of Hollywood remakes that they nearly always lose sight of what made the original good in the first place. Where Alexander Mackendricks film offered a delicately diabolical blend of the ordinary and the brutal -- it was a character comedy about a hilariously thwarted attempt to kill a frail old woman -- the new Ladykillers bludgeons you with cartoonish gags about stupid football players irritable-bowel syndrome and (for the second Coen film in a row) somebody accidentally shooting himself in the head. For all their considerable talent the Coens have almost always had trouble telling stories and here they cram the whole biddy-bashing premise into the last few minutes where it lacks all menace and brio. Is it possible that these aficionados of black comedy dont realize that The Ladykillers is supposed to be one? --J.P.

Hall J.K. Simmons Marlon Wayans; Director Ethan Coen Joel Coen; Author Ethan Coen Joel Coen; Release Date Wide 03/26/2004; Runtime (in minutes) 104; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Touchstone Pictures Posted March 25 2004 -- 1200 AM EST Before he was anointed as the Jimmy Stewart of the New America Tom Hanks used to play jerks. Put-down artists. A-holes. He has always had a streak of the caustic and he draws on that merry misanthropy to play the Southern gothic criminal mastermind of The Ladykillers Joel and Ethan Coens enjoyably screwy mad-as-a-hatter remake of the 1955 Alec Guinness comedy. As Goldthwait Higginson Dorr a charlatan professor with curlicued highbrow airs Hanks wears a devils goatee a wedge of hair that slopes onto his forehead like the corner of a doormat and a toothy smile of pure disdain. A lot of good actors have gone to work for the Coens and ended up looking like puppets but Hanks is too clever for that. He knows that hes playing a concoction rather than a human being (the original featured Guinness in fake fangs) and he lends the movie the full devious force of his bristly spirit. Dorr who speaks in floridly complete and baroque sentences wraps the plummiest of snob-Dixie accents around lines like ""The hearse is simply a vehicle commodious enough to accommodate all the members of the ensemble."" The Coens tried a similar gambit in ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" but George Clooneys ten-dollar wordplay was arbitrary and senseless - hence obnoxious. In ""The Ladykillers"" Dorrs ornate dialogue isnt just his criminal cover. He sublimates his rage into all that creamy verbosity and Hanks who sounds like he went to sleep with tapes of William F. Buckley Jr. murmuring in his ears finds a sociopaths restraint in the fussy thickets of words. In Mississippi Dorr rents a room from the pious creaky-limbed Mrs. Munson (Irma P. Hall) telling her that he plans to use her root cellar to rehearse a Renaissance quintet. Actually the ""musicians"" are a gang of thieves who plan to tunnel from the cellar into a casino vault and the prime gag of ""The Ladykillers"" is that each one of them seems to have dropped in from a different movie. Theres Gawain (Marlon Wayans) the casino janitor with a hair-trigger temper and hip-hop vocabulary; Pancake (J.K. Simmons) the explosives expert with irritable bowel syndrome; Lump (Ryan Hurst) a brainless muscleman; and the General (Tzi Ma) a wordless chain-smoker with a Hitler mustache. The Coens work in their usual visually popping clockwork mode and though the laughs dont always hit the trip-wire plot meshes shrewdly with the Coen style. Mrs. Munson in her church-lady myopia proves a formidable adversary and that renders the films gorgeous gospel soundtrack anything but gratuitous It mocks the pretensions of sinners who should have known better.
