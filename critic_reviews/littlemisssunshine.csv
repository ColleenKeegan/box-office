Comments Little Miss Sunshine Recommended This offbeat comedy was hailed at Sundance snapped up by Fox Searchlight and given a blue-chip publicity campaign developments that seem wildly out of sync with its warm regard for the underdog. A fractious family of misfits piles into an ailing VW bus and sets off for California so the youngest (Abigail Breslin) can compete in a childrens beauty pageant; suffering each other along the way are her irascible grandfather (Alan Arkin) suicidal uncle (Steve Carell) Nietzsche-obsessed teenage brother (Paul Dano) beleaguered mom (Toni Collette) and abrasive dad (Greg Kinnear) a motivational speaker whose nine-step program for success constantly aggravates the others sense of failure. As scripted by Michael Arndt this isnt much more than a glorified sitcom but it deftly dramatizes our conflicting desires for individuality and an audience to applaud it. Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris directed. R 102 min. By J.R.

The yellow brick freeway in Little Miss Sunshine leads to a girls beauty contest for Olive (Abigail Breslin) a cutie pie whos nonetheless not quite pageant material. Because they are characters in a movie and for no other reason Olives entire family must pile into a wheezing van to deliver her to the competition for the titular crown Uncle Frank (Steve Carell) recently survived a suicide attempt mum (Toni Collette) is loving but overextended dad (Greg Kinnear) is an aspiring self-help guru and therefore a nightmare brother Dwayne (Paul Dano) is a teenager and therefore mute and sulking and grandpa (Alan Arkin) is a grandpa and therefore crusty and foul-mouthed. Fox Searchlight purchased Dayton and Fariss by-the-numbers feature debut at Sundance for the astronomical sum of 10.5 million a price tag that seems all the more incongruous affixed to such a modest exploration of failures professional physical romantic financial mechanical and otherwise. The actors are uniformly fine even affecting so its too bad that the jittery camerawork and editing chops up their performances so carelessly. And while the arrhythmic incoherence of the climactic stage routine would be merely appalling from most filmmakers coming from a directing team that made their names in music videos its shall we say superfreaky.

After watching this wannabe-politically-incorrect comedy I am definitly beginning to fear the worst. Although Little Miss Sunshine aims at satire it is completely overwhelmed by perfectly acceptable clichA(c)s for the US mainstream public of today. Take for example Uncle Frank if you are gay you can either end up bashed to death (as in Brokeback Mountain) or be a poor effeminate failure attempting suicide as in Little Miss Sunshine; if youre rebellious like brother Dwayne you can take a wow of silence but of course your dream should be a correct one that of becoming an air force pilot and of course you definitely have to cry aloud that you fuck the entire world after discovering you cant. Of course like the mother you should not smoke (THE crime in the US) notice that the husband blames her for that but that nobody blames the grandfather for taking hard drugs every day no surprise since as Traffic has shown it brilliantly the Americans have long ago lost their war on drugs it has therefore become an acceptable vice. The only compassion might come from the fact that although Olive is fat she is encouraged to go to the contest again this is no surprise since America having become the fattest nation on earth you would offend about half of its 300 million citizens if you did not show this compassion. For what affects the final dance scene it is totally ridiculous with Olive being dressed almost like a prostitute. it is even bordering paedophilia which does not seem to annoy the Academy Awards that much. To sum up compared to American Beauty of 1999 for what affects social satire and family dysfunction Little Miss Sunshine definitely feels like a 1949 maccarthyst- approved satire.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map },http://www.timeout.com/film/83617.html,200,littlemisssunshine2,littlemisssunshine,timeout

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor July 28 2006 Save for later Saved Little Miss Sunshine"" is a prime example of a dysfunctional-family comedy that also doubles as a road movie. Even the vehicle of transport is dysfunctional.The Hoovers pack their dilapidated VW bus and drive from Albuquerque N.M. to Redondo Beach Calif. where 7-year-old Olive (Abigail Breslin) is entered in a preteen beauty pageant. Olive is far and away the sanest Hoover which isnt saying much. Their family name is apt - their combined neuroses vacuum up everything in sight.Along for the ride are Olives father Richard (Greg Kinnear) a motivational speaker in khaki shorts who has had no luck selling his nine-step program for success; her perpetually exasperated mother Sheryl (Toni Collette); and uncle Frank (Steve Carell) a gay Proust scholar who has recently tried to end it all. Rounding out the circus are her zombie brother Dwayne (Paul Dano) who has taken a vow of silence until he gets into the Air Force Academy and her porn-loving heroin-shooting grandpa (Alan Arkin). Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? The husband-and-wife directing team of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris known for their work in rock videos dont miss a beat. Michael Arndts screenplay has something going on almost every minute and the directors keep everything humming as if boredom was a cardinal sin. They have set out to make an audience film that hits home with all audiences - young and old - and judging from the reception the movie received at Sundance where it sold for a record 10.5 million they may well succeed. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 And in truth there is much to enjoy here starting with the performances. Kinnear has a lightweight presence but shows surprising pathos as the motivational guru who cant motivate anybody. Carell with his short bristly beard and no-blink stare is so pretentious that he seems to levitate on his own hot air. Arkin one of my favorite actors is a raunchy antidote to all those sweet codgers in the movies who go gently into that good night.The films major drawback - the reason it falls just short of terrific - is that all the family situations are contrived for maximum dysfunctionality. This gets wearying after a while. The basic formula here isnt all that different from one of those Chevy Chase National Lampoon movies and sometimes the humor potty and otherwise isnt on a much higher level either.When the film tries to be Capra-esque its even ickier Having set up the Hoovers as a gaggle of nutbrains the directors proceed to tutor us in the virtue of family togetherness. You see deep down these battlers really love each other. Blood is thicker than shtick. Dayton and Faris satirize our win-win culture but they dont miss a trick promoting ""Little Miss Sunshine"" for the winners circle. Grade B+ Rated R for language some sex and drug content.Sex/Nudity 5 scense of innuendo and frank talk about sex; 2 scenes with porn magazine covers. Violence 3 mild scenes. Profanity 58 expressions mostly strong. Drugs/Alcohol/Tobacco 2 scenes with smoking 3 scenes with heroin use.

The Hoover family (Toni Collette from left Abigail Breslin Alan Arkin Paul Dano Steve Carell and Greg Kinnear) leaves Albuquerque for a beauty pageant in Redondo Beach Calif. in Little Miss Sunshine. Photo Fox Searchlight Pictures Little Miss Sunshines dysfunctional nature glows 1 / 1 Back to Gallery In real life screwed-up malfunctioning relatives rarely take long healing drives together preferring to remain screwed up and malfunctioning until everyone cracks up or dies. But at the movies rank family dysfunction is a lovely lovely thing. It is a cause for much eccentric merrymaking. It is an opportunity for the employment of many twisted characterizations most of which cloak movieland cliches. And it is an occasion for swivel-headed moralizing on the nature of families whose fractured affections mend on a long stretch of dusty highway. Little Miss Sunshine is one such film. Its an amusing movie viciously well-written and brilliantly acted. Its cast includes four of the best character actors working today -- Steve Carell Toni Collette Greg Kinnear and Alan Arkin -- and it offers in the central role an ingenuous pixie named Abigail Breslin whose most becoming feature is her shocking dissimilarity to anything resembling a child star. With her giant plastic spectacles and trusting sweetness she looks like the ostracized nice kid on the playground -- the one whod share her Yodels if anybody asked. Breslin plays Olive daughter to Richard (Kinnear) and Sheryl (Collette) sister to Dwayne (Paul Dano). Richard is the gung-ho success guru whose nine-step self-actualization program ""Refuse to Lose"" has not yet actualized any success. Sheryl is the scattered and exhausted spouse Dwayne the teenage son who rebels by refusing to talk; hes taken a vow of silence until he gains admission to the Air Force Academy. Rounding out this crew are Arkin as Richards corrosive drug-addicted father and Carell as Frank Sheryls brother a gay Proust scholar who has just attempted suicide following a lovers break-up. When Olive gets a slot in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant the whole unlikely assemblage piles into a banana-yellow VW bus and sets out from Albuquerque to California. Along the way they encounter every manner of road block from the entrepreneurial (Richards program gets rejected) to the mechanical (the clutch of the bus goes kaput requiring everyone to push until it slides into third). At one point I wont say which the film veers toward Chevy Chase -- not in geography but in plot twist. Directed by music-video meisters Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris Little Miss Sunshine is deep down just a boiler-plate road movie kicked up with piquant asymmetric humor. It endears itself with its tragicomic performances (can one fall in love with a whole cast?) and vignettes of startling tenderness. A diner scene in which Olive orders ice cream for breakfast uses the clanking of spoons and the smacking of lips to express her familys love. But once the movie arrives in California Michael Arndts screenplay falls apart. The film becomes morally incoherent It excoriates the little-miss pageant scene with its dolled-up children in Tammy Faye makeup and yet it trades in those selfsame objectifying stereotypes when Olive gets up and does a striptease to Superfreak. Its too bad because the rest of the film has plenty to say about body image worldly success and the winning-fixated American mainstream. When Olive confesses to her grandpa that she wants to be pretty because she wants to win the pageant because she wants her father to love her (""Daddy hates losers"") the moments tearful melancholy rings true.

Starring Greg Kinnear Toni Collette Steve Carell Abigail Breslin Alan Arkin and Paul Dano. Directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris. (R. 101 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In ""Little Miss Sunshine"" the extended Hoover clan piles into a rickety yellow Volkswagen van and heads from Albuquerque to a kiddie beauty pageant in Redondo Beach so 7-year-old Olive can get a shot at a tiara. Partway there the clutch goes out and cant be repaired in time. To start the VW able family members must push and then make a dash for the moving vehicle. The first shot of three generations of Hoovers -- from Olive (the beyond-adorable Abigail Breslin) and her brother (Paul Dano) to Mom (Toni Collette) and her brother Frank (Steve Carell) to Grandpa (Alan Arkin) -- racing alongside a camper gingerly steered by Dad (Greg Kinnear) is as side-splittingly hilarious as the zaniest fix the Ricardos ever got themselves in. Remarkably the visual gag remains fresh and funny the next time. During the setup for the familys third trot however you think it cant possibly work again. But it does and from that point on you can only marvel at filmmakers Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris unerring ability to gauge just how far they -- along with the sputtering van -- can go. Their sly near-perfect comedy seems to come from nowhere. Its a first feature for Dayton and Faris as well as screenwriter Michael Arndt an awesomely original voice in a profession that rewards imitation. I like to think ""Little Miss Sunshine"" dropped from celluloid heaven as a sign that despite continual evidence to the contrary movie miracles still happen. The dysfunctional Hoover family is dysfunctional in its own way. Its a blended household (Mom is on her second marriage) with a lot of lumps. But as eccentric as everyone is youll be able to recognize something of yourself or your kin in them and its this connection that provides the movies power. Pipe dreaming is not an unusual practice but Olive is her fathers daughter in the extreme she takes it to. Hes a motivational speaker who naively believes he can spin off his prosaic nine-step program for success into books and videos -- much as Olive with her fresh-scrubbed looks and tiny potbelly thinks she has a chance to beat scary JonBenet Ramsey look-alikes. Everybody can relate to feeling jealous although hopefully not to the extent Frank does. Hes been put in his sisters care after slitting his wrists because a fellow Proust scholar whom he considers his inferior won a genius grant on top of stealing Franks boyfriend. Still on suicide watch Frank has no choice but to accompany the Hoovers to the beauty contest. Is Grandpa loony because he snorts heroin on the road -- insisting that at his age what does it matter -- or because he regrets not sleeping with lots of women when he was young and virile or is he expressing thoughts common to elderly people? He puts himself in charge of teaching Olive her dance moves which -- for a reason that doesnt become clear until the talent competition -- include growling. Truly magical moments evolve from the entire familys love for this precious little girl. Its the tie that binds them throughout a road trip from hell. Dayton and Faris husband-and-wife music video directors have the good sense not to muck around with a beguiling script by imposing distracting visual effects. Showing the vans shadow on a highway barrier is about as fancy as the pair gets. ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is the most straightforwardly told movie since ""The Straight Story."" The cast is so perfect that its impossible to imagine anyone else in the roles. Arkins spontaneity gives the impression that hes improvising. Kinnear embodies the hyped-up energy of a gambler sure his next card will beat the house. He and Collette effectively use body language to convey the frustrations of a couple trying to hold it together for the kids. The two have almost no physical contact. A scene where they verbally lash out at each other is particularly well acted. Even in such heady company Carell whose success in ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" established him as more than just a television face comes close to making this his movie. His well-honed comic instincts are evident in the way Frank intently follows the familys disjointed conversations with his eyes -- as if watching a tennis match -- and in his quickened pace to get to the pageant registration desk when the Hoovers delayed by one crisis after another arrive in Redondo Beach late. Theres no more fitting final destination than California the land of promise for generations of families seeking to improve their lot. But ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is really more about getting there. Youll be delighted if a bit breathless from laughing to be along for the ride. -- Advisory Language sexual and drug references.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post To make it to the Little Miss Sunshine pageant in Redondo Beach Calif. the Hoover family devises a way to get its dilapidated Volkswagen bus moving again and again. You may have thought the genre in which neurotic clans hit the road ran out of comedic gas after 20 years of Lampooned family vacations. But this running gag provides a fine metaphor for a hard-to-resist often riotous comedy. Co-directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris debut feature wouldnt be so darn funny poignant and occasionally naughty if not for every player pushing it toward its destination. To their credit Greg Kinnear Toni Collette Steve Carell Paul Dano Alan Arkin and Abigail Breslin all do their part as a family of disconnected misfits. Known for their music videos the husband-and-wife directing team prove theres still a way to get this type of story rolling. So what if the doors falling off? So what if the clutch doesnt pop? So what? Theres a pageant to attend a lively movie to be had. At the heart of ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is Olive. Shes the reason the Hoovers pile into that beat-up bus. The bespectacled 7-year-old has made it to the finals of the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. Olive what a perfect name. She is like the treat in a martini. Come to think of it ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is a dirty martini in which Olives spirit infuses what could have been too bracing a cocktail. Wee charmer Breslin has been here before. In 2004s ""Keane"" Lodge Kerrigans hurting story of a man whose daughter went missing on his watch her character was a balm. And this family needs a salve. Richard (Kinnear) and Sheryl (Collette) sit atop a pile of worries. Richards a motivational speaker just waiting to be called to the management-circuit big leagues. Hes an adherent of ""can-do"" theorizing in a family that is barely making do. Richards motto - ""Refuse to Lose"" - sounds more like denial than positive thinking. Although it features a beauty pageant ""Little Miss Sunshine"" trains a spotlight on guys in crises. Whether they are dads or sons gay or straight it doesnt seem to matter. Sulky teen son Dwayne (Dano) has taken a vow of silence. Hell speak again when hes accepted into the Air Force Academy. Steve Carell plays Frank. Jilted and depressed the Proust scholar was released into sister Sheryls care after a suicide attempt. Olives truest champion is Grandpa. Played with ""couldnt be bothered"" attitude by Alan Arkin the hipster codger coaches her rehearses her and at the end of the day slips into the bathroom and snorts a few lines of heroin. Unlike the similarly edgy ""Bad Santa"" which dived into nastiness then tried to pull up for unearned uplift ""Little Miss Sunshine"" never strays far from its optimistic soul which resides in the perfectly normal body of Olive. The competition of the title says a lot about where screenwriter Michael Arndt finds real depravity. Yet as freakish as the Little Miss Sunshine showdown is - tiny-tot ethnic girls twirl in cowboy get-ups towheaded lasses vamping in all the approved ways - the film cant bring itself to indulge in mean-spiritedness. From Kalina Ivanovs spot-on interiors to the scores sad- clown strains featuring the work of Denvers DeVotchKa ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is a bright beam. Jokes about the MacArthur genius prizes and Friedrich Nietzsche never become so rarefied that you cant appreciate what ails Frank and the whole Hoover tribe. Turns out brainy oddballs and slightly embittered smarty-pantses crave triumphant tales too. This one happens to be unabashedly R-rated and unapologetically pro-family.

Little Miss Sunshine Movie Review (2006) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/little-miss-sunshine-2006,200,littlemisssunshine12,littlemisssunshine,rogerebert
"Sunshine warms with dark laughs - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Sunshine warms with dark laughs By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  August 4 2006 ``Little Miss Sunshine"" was this years audience hit at the Sundance Film Festival that arbiter of indie film coolness and it floats into movie theaters today as a small-scale tonic after most of the summers big bruisers have had their way with us. That said can any film that stars Greg Kinnear and Steve Carell and that sticks to the time-honored rules of dysfunctional-family-road-trip movies really be called independent?Only a fool would say yes just as only a churl would be able to say no to this sunny prefabricated charmer of a comedy.Written by Michael Arndt and directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris ``Little Miss Sunshine"" dabbles in such ``sensitive"" subjects as homosexuality suicide child beauty pageants drug abuse among the elderly and Proust scholarship. It looks at the all-American obsession with winning and chortles darkly. You still come out of the movie wanting to give your family a hug.You want to hug the Hoover family anyway which is surprising given how cranky and ill-fitting they seem at the start. Theyre middle - class suburbanites hanging on by split fingernails dad Richard (Kinnear) is an unemployed motivational speaker desperately trying to turn his nine-step ``Refuse to Lose"" program into a book deal and a national brand. Mom Sheryl (Toni Collette) is the breadwinner ready to relegate her patience and understanding to the back of the crisper drawer. Teenage son Dwayne (Paul Dano from ``L.I.E."") is a sullen ghost who reads Nietzsche and has taken a vow of silence until hes old enough to escape to flight school.The films most sitcom-ready invention is Grandpa a heroin-snorting scoundrel living with the family only because he was kicked out of Sunset Manor; if the character were played by anyone other than Alan Arkin hed be unbearable but he is played by Arkin so hes bluntly hilarious.The Hoovers twin poles of lightness and gloom are embodied by 7-year-old Olive (Abigail Breslin) lumpy yet eternally optimistic that she can win the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant and Sheryls brother Frank (Carell) a suicidal gay academic who sucks joy out of the air like a sponge. If his brother-in-law Richard is the sort of man who gets antsy at the mention of anything negative Frank has come to accept total defeat as a welcome even necessary development. The two cancel each other out deliciously.Still how much studied wackiness can a moviegoer stand? ``Little Miss Sunshine"" answers a lot. When Olive unexpectedly gets a shot at the nationals -- the regional winner turned out to be using diet pills -- the clan piles en masse into a VW bus that itself is a rapturous parody of ruined middle-class hopes. The journey from New Mexico to California may be familiar from films ranging from ``National Lampoons Vacation"" to this years ``RV"" but the movie aims a little higher (if not as high as 1996s ``The Daytrippers"" arguably the genre champ). Contrived as it is ``Sunshine"" has the edge to open small wounds and the grace to heal them.I wont spoil the particulars -- suffice to say the litany of comic disasters is complete -- and anyway the pleasure is in the company the movie keeps. Of the cast Kinnear is the most tedious Colette -- the changeling of modern movies -- the most deep-souled Breslin the most unsinkable and Carell the most sublimely funny. This marks the comedians step up into semi-dramatic roles and he comes through; ironically the one time ``40-Year-Old Virgin"" seems the most genuine human being in this movie.A word too in praise of Danos Dwayne who says more with muteness than most actors do with dialogue. Dano 23 has the face of a dejected old lady whose feet are killing her and he turns his silence into a devastating commentary on the idiocy of ones own family. Dwayne knows and isnt saying what the rest of his clan has to find out on their own that trying to win will only make you a loser and that being yourself is the only way out of the box.``Little Miss Sunshine"" finds its own way out of the box with a beauty pageant finale that cheerfully trashes everything such events hold dear. Thats an awfully easy target but you dont mind because by then the film has earned its fellow feeling. Maybe the filmmakers pull their punches because theyre not interested in crafting a dark uncompromising ``indie movie."" Maybe this is the sort of mainstream entertainment -- with just enough nutrients to make it stick -- the big studios have forgotten how to make. At the very least its a situation comedy that rescues the very meaning of the phrase.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

All dysfunctional families at least in the movies are unhappy -- and unhilarious -- in different ways. If youre going to get on the wavelength of Little Miss Sunshine youve got to be able to enjoy a comedy in which the characters fit into hermetically cute predetermined sitcom slots. The members of the Hoover clan include the ineffectual boob of a father (Greg Kinnear) whos desperate to market his annoyingly unoriginal ""9 Steps"" motivational program; a saintly sourpuss mom (Toni Collette); her gay brother a suicidal Proust scholar (Steve Carell); the teen son (Paul Dano) who hates his family so much that he hasnt spoken in a year; and Grandpa (Alan Arkin) a grouch who stokes his X-rated I got nothin to lose commentary by snorting heroin. Sorry folks but these are not organic characters; theyre walking talking catalogs of screenwriter index-card data. One cant deny though that theres an idiosyncratic plastic cleverness to Little Miss Sunshine. As the family drives to Redondo Beach so that 7-year-old Olive (the charming Abigail Breslin) can compete in the Little Miss Sunshine preteen pageant the movie shrouds its synthetic soul in a patina of ""indie"" realism the leisurely rhythms the lovely desert road-movie vistas the terrific actors doing what they can to alchemize schlock into gold. The beauty-pageant climax is pure hypocrisy as the movie mocks the freakish baby-whore contestants yet celebrates Olive for doing in essence just what they do. Smarmy? Yes but more than that not funny.

"The sun doesnt shine on delusion - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEW The sun doesnt shine on delusionAnd it never will for the Hoover family whose dreams are crushed in the funny subversive `Little Miss Sunshine.July 26 2006|Carina Chocano | Times Staff Writer ""When all professions are open to all and when one can reach the summit of each of them by oneself"" Alexis de Tocqueville wrote about American democracy in the 1830s foreshadowing the massive crisis in status anxiety that would eventually compel us to buy Hummers and use phrases like ""new paradigm"" with a straight face ""an immense and easy course seems to open before the ambition of men and they willingly fancy that they have been called to great destinies. But that is an erroneous view corrected by experience every day.""In ""Little Miss Sunshine"" an ordinary middle-class family has erroneous views corrected by experience the hard way. Over the course of three harrowing days on a road trip reluctantly embarked on so that their daughter may compete in a childrens beauty pageant the Hoovers come face to face with the cruel limits of their dreams opportunities and possibilities. One by one they fail despite their best efforts their sincere desire to succeed and their many merits as people. In this way the rambunctiously modest and unassuming comedy which was acquired by Fox Searchlight at Sundance for a record 10.5 million (though you almost hate to mention the amount given the moral of the story) is as ambitious honest and subversive as any American movie since ""Election.""The Hoovers live in Albuquerque in a modest wood-paneled tract house where dinner means chicken from a bucket. But they are consumed by fantasies of success that keep them locked in their separate worlds struggling to measure up to impossibly high standards. Even their name is aspirational -- they effortlessly hoover every message put out by a monolithic inherently antihumanist mass culture.Having devised a nine-step motivational program called ""Refuse to Lose"" Richard Hoover (Greg Kinnear) dreams of Tony Robbins-esque success but has so far only succeeded in burying his personality under a heap of irritating catch-phrases and driving his family crazy. His Nietzsche-reading stepson Dwayne (Paul Dano) has fashioned himself into a do-or-die superman by taking a vow of silence until he can fulfill his dream of getting accepted into the Air Force Academy. Grandpa (Alan Arkin) using what experience has taught him about winning and losing has embraced hedonism late in life and gotten himself kicked out of his beloved retirement home for snorting heroin. Seven-year-old Olive (Abigail Breslin) who is chubby awkward and unself-consciously weird spends her time rehearsing her Little Miss Sunshine talent routine and practicing her victorious meltdown in front of the television.Uncle Frank (Steve Carell) the foremost Proust scholar in the United States has been sent to stay with the Hoover family following a suicide attempt after the graduate student he loves runs off with the second-most-renowned Proust scholar in the nation.Meanwhile his sister Sheryl (Toni Collette) who is married to Richard keeps the family afloat financially but is at a loss as to how to keep them from falling apart.Given the precariousness of their financial situation and the shaky emotional states of Dwayne and Frank the Hoovers find themselves with no other choice but to travel to California together in their old VW bus. Before theyve made it out of New Mexico the clutch gives out making it impossible for them to keep going without pushing the car chasing it and hopping aboard like freight-hopping hobos as it barrels forward at full speed. Needless to say the bus is a speeding ramshackle symbol of you name it -- the reckless endangerment demanded of average people by a winner-takes-all culture a society coming apart at the wheels and of course the rickety ethos of a generation that forever cemented rule-breaking individualism with ostentatious material success. What keeps the characters -- and the vehicle -- from feeling as arbitrarily schematic as characters in a sitcom is that writer Michael Arndt and directors Valerie Faris and Jonathan Dayton understand how all of the characters have carefully constructed their identities from noncompatible mass-produced kits. Consumed with becoming the Hoovers are literally not themselves.Told as a picaresque road trip ""Little Miss Sunshine"" employs razor-sharp humor and a deceptively realistic style to satirize a corrupt society that heroes of low status must navigate by their wits alone. The movie is exceptionally well cast with actors whose faces betray their humanity with every indignity they suffer (and there are lots of them each funnier than the last).Carell gives a wonderfully wry and sensitive performance as a defrocked and humiliated eminence who ultimately learns to find solace in his subject -- the epically morose but insightful Marcel Proust -- rather than the external symbols of academic achievement. (Those will be handed in a neat and tidy bundle to his smarmy competitor Larry Sugarman.)1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESLittle Miss Sunshine musical heading off-BroadwayMay 23 2013Little Miss Sunshine infoMarch 2 2011Directors note teamworkJanuary 10 2007`Sunshine With A Few CloudsNovember 1 2006Early pageant hopefulOctober 13 2006Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword",http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jul/26/entertainment/et-little26,200,littlemisssunshine19,littlemisssunshine,latimes

This wonderful debut feature which also qualifies as a road movie was directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris from an original screenplay by Michael Arndt. It has a top-notch cast that includes a VW bus with a terminal transmission problem In a clutch there is no clutch. Nevertheless the whole thing turns on the seven-year-old child at the storys center and sweet chubby Olive is absolutely perfect. Fairly vibrating with hope as she peers out at the world from behind big round specs Olive who is played by Abigail Breslin knows almost nothing of what awaits her at the end of a bumpy road that winds from Albuquerque to L.A. but shes determined to prevail. While the film itself isnt perfect who cares about perfection in the face of abundant life authentic screwiness and lovely surprises by the busload? The pretext for the plot pops up early. Olive learns that shes eligible by virtue of a fateful fluke to compete for the title of Little Miss Sunshine in the California contest of the same name. To do so however she must mobilize her family a quarrelsome group of depressives who are happily not depressing at all because theyre really funny. ENLARGE This family comedy doubles as a road movie and the road is a bumpy one for this dysfunctional crew as they head west. Olives father Richard Hoover (Greg Kinnear) is a motivational speaker whose own will to win is following his career down the drain; hes a younger handsome Willy Loman. Her mother Sheryl (Toni Collette) claims to be ""pro-truth"" but shes a passive accessory to her husbands self-deception. Sheryls brother Frank (Steve Carell) was a pre-eminent Proust scholar; now hes flirting with suicide having been jilted by his gay lover. Olives brother Dwayne (Paul Dano) was inspired by reading Nietzsche to take a vow of silence ""Welcome to hell"" he writes on a tablet by way of welcoming Frank to the familys bosom. And the heroines grandfather played with inspired scabrousness by Alan Arkin is currently a blight on that bosom because his fondness for sniffing coke got him evicted from his retirement home. As stay-at-homes spinning in their own eccentric orbits the Hoovers are entertaining if slightly oppressive. Once they decide to hit the road for California though the movie turns into an adventure with a convincing sense of urgency and not just because of the tight deadline for registering Olive as a contestant. The dramatic engine is her heart-melting mixture of anxiety expectancy and joy at the prospect of competing and in the spirit of fatuous lectures from the father she heedlessly loves winning. (The production also benefits from an evocative sound track and from Tim Suhrstedts cinematography which makes a low-budget film look stylish.) In the spirit of classic road movies ""Little Miss Sunshine"" takes unforeseen detours into outlandish situations with consistent verve. The co-directors who are husband and wife have extensive experience in TV comedy commercials and music videos so their fluent technique is no surprise. What I found remarkable however was their unerring feel for the scripts unusual range -- its about death as well as life -- and for its quicksilver tone. As one of many examples a scene involving Olives brother starts with an outburst that promises to be tragic turns almost instantly to farce then becomes a quick study in suspense with a payoff thats as satisfying as it is affecting. Such a string of small tossed-off epiphanies can take your breath away; its whats missing from todays big-budget studio films which sell their scenes doggedly one emotion at a time. Another example can be found studied and savored in the online trailer. Its the moment when Olive asks her grandfather if shes pretty and the scruffy old guy says ""You are the most beautiful girl in the whole world."" Abigail Breslin plays at least four emotions -- belief disbelief desperation and love -- almost simultaneously while she replies ""Ah youre just saying that."" How one gets that kind of complexity in a very young persons performance is mysterious to say the least but there it is on screen. Olives fate as a beauty contestant isnt the only thing that hangs in the balance while the Hoovers lurch westward -- their fate as a family is being worked out too. Its the main thing though and the contest as a piece of garish Americana doesnt disappoint -- imagine a whole stageful of JonBenet Ramseys strutting their ghastly stuff. (Its all the more chilling to think that Olives rivals were played by real-life veterans of these pre-pubescent pageants.) Yet the outcome for all its humor and surprise feels ambiguous in ways that may not have been intended. Olive isnt changed by her experience on stage since shes too young to put it in perspective and Im not sure I understand any better than she does what she or we should take away from it. Still thats far from a fatal flaw. What we take away from the movie as a whole is the prize of steady pleasure.

"Sunshine beams but darkly - USATODAY.com SearchHow do I find it?Subscribe to paper Home News Travel Money Sports Life Tech Weather Movies Cars  Event tickets   Jobs Real estate  Shop   Online degrees Sunshine beams but darkly Updated 7/26/2006 625 PM ET E-mail | Print | By Claudia Puig USA TODAY There is nothing inherently sunny about Little Miss Sunshine (   1/2 out of four) and thats part of the fresh and clever lunacy of this deliciously dark comedy. Video Watch a preview of the movie Most of the humor comes out of the sharply written script and arises naturally from the actions and motivations of the offbeat characters as opposed to the forced hilarity and formulaic tendencies of the bigger-budgeted summer comedies. Directors Valerie Faris and Jonathan Dayton and screenwriter Michael Arndt have fashioned a hilarious screwball comedy in the tradition of Frank Capra films with a contemporary dark quality. A big hit on the film-festival circuit Sunshine recalls the zany cross-country trek of 1996s quirky Flirting with Disaster. Its wit is leavened by physical humor that borders on the slapstick but its one of the rare comedies that is consistently funny for most of its 101 minutes which is no small feat. The story centers on a journey undertaken by a fracturing family who seem to have more than their fair share of problems. The teenage son (Paul Dano) is so alienated that he has decided to stop speaking. Dano manages to be believably brooding oddly endearing and funny. His scholarly gay uncle (Steve Carell in one of his best performances yet) is grappling with a suicidal depression and the grandfather (Alan Arkin) is a heroin user and porn aficionado. Though these seem like extreme roles they are played with considerable subtlety. Greg Kinnear is spot-on as the control-freak dad a failed motivational speaker ""Sarcasm is the refuge of losers"" he smarmily informs those who mock him. His wife Toni Collette is trying wanly to hold the family together. At the heart of the film is Olive a plucky little girl played to perfection by Abigail Breslin. Her portrayal is not only adorable but also intelligent and surprisingly nuanced for a 9-year-old actress. Olive yearns to be a child beauty queen and the family undertakes a trip to a pageant several states away so she can fulfill her dreams. Her worn-out parents gain strength from her hope determination and enthusiastic innocence. Arkins grandfather has his faults but he is devoted to Olive. The familys bizarre experiences en route to the contest culminating with the ultra-weird pageant atmosphere somehow strengthen their ties. It has been a while since weve seen such a consistently funny and entertaining road movie. Its not a classic summer comedy -- its dark themes might have played better during the fall and winter months -- but it is definitely a refreshing alternative in a season filled with hot air and predictability.

"Little Miss Sunshine reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Little Miss Sunshine reviewed. Little Miss Sunshine reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 25 2006 711 PM Little Miss Cant Be Wrong Finally a summer movie worth watching. By Dana Stevens The cast of Little Miss Sunshine Last year everybody was talking about why Americans didnt want to go to the movies anymore despite the dreary elephantine spectacles being rolled out for their enjoyment. This summer in an arguably even more depressing development people are flocking in record numbers to the dreary elephantine spectacles. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Little Miss Sunshine (Fox Searchlight)is a breezy goodbye to all that a sweet-natured throwback to an era when once in a while someone made a movie just for the hell of it. It wont crush any box-office records or sell any tie-in toys and it couldnt give less of a damn. When I saw that this was the first feature film from Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris the husband-and-wife commercial directors who used the haunting Nick Drake song ""Pink Moon"" as a ditty to sell Volkswagens I feared the worst. But Little Miss Sunshine has not a hint of exploitation about it and its sentimental only in the best sense of the word. Like its heroine Olive Hoover it wears its heart on its sleeve and assumes the best about everyone even when they dont seem to deserve it. Advertisement Olive (played by Abigail Breslin) is a quiet little girl from Albuquerque N.M. with giant eyeglasses a slight potbelly and only one dream--to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant which shes just qualified for in a last-minute fluke. But to get to Redondo Beach Calif. in time for the pageant shell need the help of her whole family and this is a family that could use some help itself. Olives father Richard (Greg Kinnear) is an unsuccessful motivational speaker--a career description thats a joke in itself and that perfectly epitomizes  this movies mix of hopelessness and pluck. His wife Sheryl (Toni Collette) holds the family together with upbeat platitudes and buckets of takeout chicken but shes clearly reaching the end of her rope. Their older son  teenager Dwayne (Paul Dano) is a Nietzsche fanatic whos taken a vow of silence until hes old enough to become a fighter pilot; his communication with the family has dwindled to scrawling the words ""I hate everybody"" on a notepad. If possible the extended Hoover clan is even more miserable than the immediate family. Alan Arkin plays Richards father an oversexed misanthrope who defends his heroin-snorting habit with the cogent argument ""Im old"" and deflects further criticism by snarling ""I still got Nazi bullets in my ass."" And Frank (Steve Carell) Sheryls brother is a total wreck a suicidal gay academic whos just lost his boyfriend to the second-greatest Proust scholar in the country. (Asked who the greatest is he deadpans ""That would be me."") With his wrists still bandaged from his latest attempt to kill himself Frank can hardly be left alone so he piles into the Hoovers ancient yellow VW bus and they all set out for California. I am fully aware that this sounds like the setup for an overly cute family road picture something heartwarming involving Robin Williams poop jokes and roadkill. But Little Miss Sunshine is not that kind of movie. If anything the recent film it most recalls is You Can Count on Me (2000) another small treasure about a fractured family that managed to be moving without troweling on the sap. Little Miss Sunshine has some elements of farce including extended sequences of physical comedy and an unlikely exuberant finale. But it takes its characters very seriously indeed and affords them a measure of dignity even at their most ridiculous. Steve Carell is exquisitely cast in his first serious role as the melancholic literature professor with a taste for Buns magazine. He even looks a little like Proust with his hollow eyes and well-kempt beard and hes invented a special running gait for his character--you can see it on the movies poster--thats both hilarious and telling. Alan Arkin is especially so as the genially filthy-minded grandfather and Abigail Breslin who nearly stole the movie Signs in a tiny part as Mel Gibsons daughter is an acting career waiting to happen. Shes not ""cute"" in the usual Hollywood sense like those terrifying children in the Welchs grape juice commercials. Shes cute the way real kids are unpredictable vulnerable resilient and tender. The movies portrait of the world of juvenile beauty pageants while frighteningly accurate in some ways underestimates how hermetic and exclusionary these events must actually be--theres not a chance in the world an amateur like Olive could ascend as high as she does here. And at least one of the movies subplots having to do with Dwaynes dream of a fighter-pilot career pops out of nowhere only to be resolved much too quickly and facilely. But it feels churlish to lodge too many complaints against Little Miss Sunshine. Like the broken-down VW bus that ferries the Hoovers cross-country this film may be a ramshackle vehicle but it gets you where you want to go.

"Little Miss Sunshine | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; little-miss-sunshine ) Little Miss Sunshine (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli It takes a deft hand to fashion a feel-good movie with plenty of laughs and an upbeat ending out of a story that includes drug addiction a suicide attempt a death Nietzsche and Proust. Despite treading through a minefield of tone shifts co-directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris and writer Michael Arndt reach the other side unscathed. Little Miss Sunshine is a small gem - or considering the inclusion of hot star Steve Carell and the 10 million price tag paid by Fox Searchlight to acquire the distribution rights perhaps not so ""small."" Smiles will be in evidence of the faces of audience members exiting a showing of this movie. The husband-and-wife team of Dayton and Faris are making their feature debut after directing countless music videos and TV commercials. Thankfully the pair takes a traditional approach in bringing first-time screenwriter Arndts vision to the screen. We are not inundated by the sorts of camera tricks and flash edits that often accompany music video directors into multiplexes. Instead Dayton and Faris give their characters opportunities to come to life which is all one can ask in a situation like this. Additionally they are apt at mixing comedy and drama. Little Miss Sunshine achieves a middle ground that many movies miss. The average viewer will laugh many times but the underlying seriousness of the films messages is not lost in the comedy. The motley group at the center of Little Miss Sunshine might not win the top award at the Dysfunctional Family Film competition but they would capture a runners-up position. Richard (Greg Kinnear) the dad is a motivational speaker whose nine-step plan proves to be his guiding principle in business and life. Sheryl (Toni Collette) the mom is using every ounce of energy to keep her family from blowing apart. Dwayne (Paul Dano) the teenage son is a fan of Nietzsche and has taken a vow of silence. Olive (Abigail Breslin) the daughter is a beauty pageant addict and has recently placed second in a local under-10 contest. Uncle Frank (Steve Carell) is living with his sisters family because he recently attempted suicide after losing his lover his job and his reputation in a scandal. Then theres heroin-snorting grandpa (Alan Arkin) whos too controversial for a retirement community. When the abdication of the beauty contest winner gives Olive the top spot the family boards the old VW bus for a road trip to California where she has a chance to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. The road trip is a mix of highs and lows comedy and tragedy and revelations. But nothing on the journey prepares the family for what they encounter in Redondo Beach when they come face to face with the travesty of little girls tarted up to look like glamour queens. Over the course of 100 minutes Little Miss Sunshine covers a lot of ground. The bulk of the film encapsulates the road trip. Similarities to the recent R.V. exist but this production is fresher funnier and less artificial. There are some solid comedic moments Grandpas words of wisdom to his mute grandson practical advice on starting a car with a broken clutch an encounter with a highway patrolman and a bit that would be at home in Weekend at Bernies. The climactic segment which ventures into near-horror movie territory with its depiction of seven-year old ""beauty queens"" is enough to make any sane viewer uncomfortable. Little Miss Sunshine condemns this abusive culture with a mixture of satire and pathos. The ending despite devolving into an absurdity appropriate for the setting is note-perfect. Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette form the backbone of Little Miss Sunshines skeleton but their workmanlike performances are the least notable. Paul Dano does a lot with a role that robs him of dialogue and Abigail Breslin (who made her debut in Signs) shows herself to be more capable than about 95% of the performers in her age group. Shes talented understands her part and avoids the terminal cuteness that afflicts too many portrayals by young actors. Steve Carell surprises by playing it straight. Unlike Will Farrell who was awkward in his non-comedic turn in Winter Passing Carells performance is unaffected. He gets some laughs but not by doing anything outrageous or extreme. Finally theres veteran Alan Arkin who steals every scene hes in. Over the years Arkin has honed his timing and means of delivery and they serve him well here. If properly marketed Little Miss Sunshine could prove to be a sleeper hit. Its the kind of picture audiences enjoy because theres substance to go with the humor and movie-goers will leave the theater feeling uplifted. Ultimately despite flirting with some darker subjects Little Miss Sunshine lives up to its name.

By Christie Lemire updated 7/26/2006 81010 PM ET 2006-07-27T001010 Print Font + - REVIEW Back in the day Public Enemy urged us ""Dont believe the hype."" With ""Little Miss Sunshine"" you should just ignore the hype entirely tune out the buzz thats been building steadily for this movie since it was picked up at the Sundance Film Festival in January for a record 10.5 million. Instead just buckle up and go along for the ride. This small gem is a road trip comedy that subverts the genre -- a welcome change a few months after the lame ""RV"" -- and instead offers a surprising mix of dark humor and heart with rich performances from a strong cast. Whats even more amazing is that this is the first feature from husband-and-wife directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris as well as screenwriter Michael Arndt. In crafting their story about a family of losers struggling to survive in a society obsessed with winning theyve come up with no stereotypes no self-consciously quirky indie-movie cliches. Rather these are real people who are all hiding behind something all trying to be someone theyre not until they realize after being crammed together for 48 hours that theyre fine just the way they are. Which sounds painfully feel-good -- but mercifully its not. Advertise Advertise Advertise The title alone suggests the possibility of preachy affirmation but Little Miss Sunshine is actually the name of a garishly oversexualized Southern California beauty pageant where sweetly awkward 7-year-old Olive Hoover (the irresistible Abigail Breslin) plans to compete. For various reasons that we wont disclose here (but they do make sense we promise) the entire Hoover family must pack up the VW bus in Albuquerque N.M. to help her get there. Dad Richard (Greg Kinnear with high-energy desperation) has been furiously trying to sell his nine-step ""Refuse to Lose"" self-help program. Nobody is buying. His own brash dad (Alan Arkin) is stuck living with the Hoovers after being kicked out of his retirement home. He copes through porn and snorting lines of heroin.

Cranston Hamm more Toy Story toys burn up in prank on mom Richards scrawny teenage son Dwayne (Paul Dano) has taken a vow of silence as he rigorously trains himself hoping to get into the Air Force Academy. He reads Nietzsche and sulks all day. Richards brother-in-law (Steve Carell) a Proust scholar also has come to live with them after trying to kill himself. His suicide attempt -- prompted by being rejected by a male graduate student -- becomes the stuff of matter-of-fact dinner table discussion. And finally there is the harried matriarch Sheryl (Toni Collette) who strives in vain for suburban normalcy. She holds it all together with the help of cigarettes she swears she isnt smoking. Longtime music video directors Dayton and Faris play all of this straight with simple intimate camerawork and without jaunty music to punctuate the weirdness. Instead they opt for a tone of slowly percolating absurdity -- and there would have been a lot to laugh about here even if the Hoovers had never gotten into the car and headed for Redondo Beach. But this is one of those films where the journey is of course the destination. (Youve gotta love the fact that they actually travel on highways and stop at chain restaurants to eat like ordinary people do and defy the road trip movie conventions of two-lane roads and out-of-the-way eateries.) Small moments reveal how brutally honest and observant the script can be including a scene in which the slightly tubby Olive ponders ordering waffles and ice cream for breakfast with varying responses from the male family members whove shaped her young life. Each character undergoes a personal crisis during this weekend excursion which does seem a bit contrived but it also offers the actors some stand-out moments. Dano who previously co-starred as the self-loathing Klitz in ""The Girl Next Door"" is especially remarkable because he has to do more with less. Carell is the most fantastic surprise of all though; after making his name with deadpan comedy on TVs ""The Daily Show"" and ""The Office"" and in movies including ""Anchorman"" and ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" here hes deadly serious and shows an unexpected depth. Through all of these misadventures Breslin remains steady the youngest of all but also the most reliable. Bespectacled and beaming with excitement shes a joy to watch as warm and bright as the pageant title her character covets. (c) 2013 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Pics distinguished by a flawless cast a gentle spirit of rebellion and a smart script by first-time screenwriter Michael Arndt that knows never to push its character quirks too hard. Its humanity and heart make it a natural to transcend the indie niche to a broader audience. Within hours of its premiere at Sundance Fox Searchlight swooped in to close a worldwide distribution deal on the film snagging the specialty division a release that stands a chance of being molded into another crossover hit on the order of its Park City pickups ""Garden State"" and ""Napoleon Dynamite."" Like the broken-down VW bus that transports the Hoovers from their home in Albuquerque N.M. on a foolhardy but determined mission to Redondo Beach Calif. the filmmakers have an astute understanding that a family is a wildly imperfect machine made up of ill-fitting components and prone to malfunctions minor and major. A sharply cut opening sequence of quick character-establishing scenes underlines that this is an especially problematic clan. Richard (Greg Kinnear) is a motivational speaker on a career downslide yet stubbornly committed to his ""Refuse to lose"" philosophy. His wife Sheryl (Toni Collette) barely disguises her impatience with his canned claptrap hinting at deeper marital disharmony. Their teenage son Dwayne (Paul Dano) is a Nietzsche devotee maintaining a vow of silence until hes old enough to become a fighter pilot while Grandpa (Alan Arkin) is a profane old horndog with a heroin habit. Newest addition to the household is Sheryls suicidal brother Frank (Steve Carell) a renowned Proust scholar who lost both the male grad student he loved and a MacArthur Foundation genius grant to a rival academic. The familys sole oasis of serenity and self-possession is Olive (Abigail Breslin) a slightly chubby bespectacled 7-year-old with a questioning nature and a fixation on beauty pageants. Having been taught to pursue her dreams Olive has been privately rehearsing her talent routine with Grandpa; her shot at the Little Miss Sunshine crown is the engine that drives the comedy. There are probably few more obvious emblems of soulless success than a childrens beauty contest. And the notion that Olive would somehow get onstage without her parents having any knowledge of the act she was preparing -- or any misgivings until the last minute about the potential humiliation shes being subjected to -- seems implausible. But as a chaotic cathartic bonding experience it works in part because the family members are so caught up in their individual frustrations and insecurities. During the interstate trip punctuated by hilarious setbacks and disasters the directors nurture the melancholy strain in Arndts script while subtly coaxing small signs of love and support within the Hoover family. The eccentric comic tone is deftly channeled by a cast with no weak element. As a guy who seemingly buys into the most trite prefab pop-psych blather but gradually reveals his deeper sensitivity Kinnear has never been better while Collette does lovely understated work as an emotionally burdened abraded woman whose caring nature is never in doubt. Following ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""The Office"" Carell shows further evidence hes the real deal with his morosely deadpan characterization. Arkin gets the best lines as the irascible oldster with no politeness filter. Dano plays an introspective teen different from his character in ""L.I.E."" Communicating only with terse notes such as ""I hate everyone"" for much of the movie hes both funny and affecting. Gracefully sidestepping all the usual traps of too-cute screen tykes Breslin is a delight anchoring the comedy with a balance of guilelessness and innate wisdom as a kid who marches to her own drummer. The directors light uncalculated touch with the material is echoed in the modest productions fresh appealingly unslick feel. Tim Suhrstedts widescreen lensing is notable for its agitated movement and quirky but unforced visual compositions while the score by Mychael Danna and performers DeVotchka supplies warm animated rhythms.
