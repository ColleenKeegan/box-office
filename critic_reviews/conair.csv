If Simpson were to get a special afterlife screening of Con Air I have no doubt that hed give it the big thumbs-up. For Con Air a headache in the form of a movie is like an homage to everything Simpson stood for as a producer noise testosterone the glory of wretched excess. This renegade action fantasy which pretends to be about a hijacked plane full of vicious criminals but is really about proving that a movie can pin an audience to the wall with entertainment (call it the cattle-prod school of higher zapping) comes at you as a series of nonstop climaxes. Its so shameless so psychotically nervous about keeping you ""thrilled"" that the phrase over the top wont do it justice. Its like a drug designed for people whove done every drug and now want to be jet-propelled into numbness. The picture is being marketed as a de facto sequel to The Rock the final Simpson-Bruckheimer collaboration (a joke in which the lead villain played by John Malkovich knocks a rock out of the way is featured prominently in the television ads). The Rock in essence was a remake of Die Hard and what gave it its distinctive overwrought garishness was the incoherent splatter- editing technique of director Michael Bay; it was like two hours of confetti exploding in your face. Con Air is a cleaner piece of overkill (at least you can tell whats going on) but it crowds you in a different way. The movie is all sweaty close-ups -- the actors playing goateed sociopaths are framed like mug shots -- and the script by Scott Rosenberg master of the embarrassingly ""hip"" one-liner (hes the one who inflicted the baroque preciousness of Things to Do in Denver When Youre Dead on us) is a knotty pileup of clever-dumb Eastwood/Willis/Arnold aphorisms most of which are too tortured to be funny. (Malkovich to rapist ""If your d-- jumps out of your pants you jump out of this plane"") Nicolas Cage gets right into the you-wont-believe-this- but-then-neither-do-we spirit of it all. As Cameron Poe a decorated Army ranger who has spent eight years in prison on an involuntary manslaughter charge (he was protecting his wife from a barroom bully) and is now flying to freedom on a plane thats carrying nearly a dozen specimens of criminal scum he sports long hippie locks that give him a saintly Christ-gone-Rambo look and he speaks in a noble overdeliberate drawl that makes him even more of a walking put-on than he was as the Elvis-in-snakeskin hipster of Wild at Heart. (He kills but only because he loves.) Cameron doesnt want any trouble but Cyrus ""The Virus"" Grissom (Malkovich) a brilliant mass murderer has engineered an escape. For a while as were introduced to the various convicts the movie is fun in a slick degenerate way; its like a nihilist retread of The Dirty Dozen. But Malkovichs master plan turns out to be an unwieldy bummer. It involves landing the plane in Carson City letting off six men as decoys taking off landing the plane again standing around in the desert and then spending half an hour firing rocket launchers at federal agents. Some of the actors are appealing -- I liked the way Ving Rhames could seem warm and murderous at the same time -- but theyre all playing cliches. Malkovich looking like the late punk-rock ghoul GG Allin does his hostile whining and Steve Buscemi as a serial killer who comes on board in a Hannibal Lecter mask is like a parody of a parody -- hes so calm almost catatonic that its as if the film couldnt be bothered to make him remotely threatening. John Cusack as the U.S. marshal tracking the convicts is as boyish as Cage is ersatz macho. In Con Air all that matters is the next cataclysm the execution-style killings the bomb that goes off in someones face the preposterous climax set aboard a fire truck speeding through Las Vegas the fact that there are not one but two shots of men running toward us in slow motion as the world explodes behind them. Con Air may be the closest thing yet to pure action-thriller pornography. Ultimately theres nothing to it but thrust.

"Con Air (R) Critics Corner Desson Howe - Weekend section ""Nicolas Cage is one of our most enjoyable screen heroes."" Rita Kempley - Style section ""Proposterous predictable but excessively entertaining."" Go to Video Finder Con Air One night U.S. Ranger Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) and his pregnant wife Tricia face three thugs who intend to beat Cameron and rape his wife. When Cameron kills one of them hes sent to the slammer for seven to 10 years. Finally the day comes when Cameron is to be paroled. He gets into a prisoner-transport plane carrying his precious letters and a bunny he intends to give his girl on her 8th birthday. The plane is full of the most ornery criminals in the United States. These Bad Boys intend to hijack the plane and make their escape. When the in-flight security is overpowered Cameron groans inwardly. Accepting his heroic destiny like the Ranger he is Cameron pretends to be one of the Wild Bunch so he can eventually outwit them maintain secret contact with U.S. Marshall Vince Larkin and still help little Casey blow out her candles. -- Desson Howe Director Simon West Cast John Cusack; Nicolas Cage; John Malkovich; Steve Buscemi; Nick Chinlund; Rachel Ticotin; Ving Rhames; Mykelti Williamson; David Chappelle; Danny Trejo; Colm Meaney; M.C.

Hiply written and cast and shrewdly positioned dramatically to exploit both the allure of lawlessness and the appeal of virtue this first official solo effort by producer Jerry Bruckheimer is as sure-fire commercial and just as elaborate as anything he did with his late partner Don Simpson. Apart from not knowing to quit while its ahead ""Con Air"" provides quite an exciting flight prior to its crash and burn. Hiply written and cast and shrewdly positioned dramatically to exploit both the allure of lawlessness and the appeal of virtue this first official solo effort by producer Jerry Bruckheimer is as sure-fire commercial and just as elaborate as anything he did with his late partner Don Simpson. High-octane actioner will fly the distance at dizzying B.O. altitudes. Scott Rosenbergs insidiously clever script draws upon any number of time-tested dramatic conventions most importantly the ""Dirty Dozen"" collection of hardened criminals who have nothing to lose and the stalwart loner hero on an arduous odyssey home to his family a man who walks the thin line between good and bad and can play one off the other not unlike Clint Eastwoods Man With No Name. Viewers can thus have it both ways reveling in the baddies crazed antics while remaining certain that their surrogate will pull them as well as himself through in the end. And pic has the further disarming quality of knowing how to kid itself. British commercials and musicvid director Simon West making his feature bow literally races through the exposition. In a matter of minutes he disposes of the information that Army ranger Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) unjustly imprisoned for eight years for a killing that was basically self-defense is a man of honor and righteous values and that the plane on which he catches a ride home to see his wife and little daughter the latter for the first time is a U.S. Marshals Service transport on an ""all-star flight"" with a passenger list consisting of ""every creep and freak in the universe"" being delivered to a new facility. Chief among them is Cyrus (The Virus) Grissom (John Malkovich) a certifiably insane but brilliant master criminal commanding enough to lead such other three-time losers as murderous black militant Diamond Dog (Ving Rhames) the violence-prone Billy Bedlam (Nick Chinlund) and fearsome career rapist Johnny 23 (Danny Trejo). Almost at once the prisoners are able to take over the plane a slow bulky C-123K prop that first heads for Carson City where it unloads three men but takes on several more including legendary serial killer Garland Greene (Steve Buscemi) and a good ol boy pilot (M.C. Gainey) who may or may not know how to fly this crate. Moving things along with tremendous velocity and great verbal and thespian punch pic keeps any number of levels of tension going during the course of the flight Will Cameron whose resourcefulness and smarts the ever-observant Cyrus quickly comes to admire be found out as a parolee and not a hardened criminal? Will Diamond Dog remain subservient long enough for everyone to reach their destination? Will anyone be able to prevent Johnny 23 from raping the female guard (Rachel Ticotin) whos cuffed inside the plane? Will Cameron find a way to give his diabetic prison buddy Baby-O (Mykelti Williamson) the insulin he needs? And will drag queen inmate Sally Cant Dance (Renoly) ever find a dress he can change into? On the ground U.S. Marshal Vince Larkin (John Cusack) does his best to keep up with whats going on in the air and to prevent short-tempered DEA agent Duncan Malloy (Colm Meaney) from blowing the hijacked plane out of the sky. When Cameron in one of the films show-stopping scenes manages to get a message to Larkin by dropping a body out of the sky over downtown Fresno the agent races to a remote desert airfield where Cyrus has arranged to rendezvous with a south-of-the-border drug lord who will supposedly jet them out of the country. Film begins shifting into overdrive at this point as a fierce battle between the cons and authorities at this airplane graveyard yields a surfeit of fiery explosions and hurtling bodies. Remarkably the surviving desperadoes manage to get the plane aloft once again this time to land it -- where else -- right on the Vegas Strip. One can see the picture deflating right before ones eyes during this utterly overdone and needless climax-upon-a-climax as it saps the high spirits it has maintained through most of the flight; big scene of the plane crashing into a casino is the worst in the film with furious overcutting unable to disguise bad continuity varying special effects techniques and inconsistent airplane speeds. Protracting things even further with the groan-inducing villain-who-wont-die gambit and finally with a cornball reunion scene of Cameron with his family merely makes matters worse. But the good stuff is strong enough to carry the day. Rosenbergs sarcastic tough-guy dialogue is full of lean-and-mean one-liners and the superbly cast actors know how to milk them for all theyre worth. Unlikely action star Cage very buff walks the fine line between self-preservation and selfless heroics with great aplomb keeping the audience with him at all times. Malkovich and Buscemi both playing characters apparently vying to join the Hannibal Lecter ranks of mad genius killers stand out among a stellar lineup of baddies portrayed by the formidable Rhames Gainey Trejo Chinlund Jesse Borrego and Dave Chappelle among others. Stylistically film becomes more frenetic as it goes and Wests compositions lack the strength and definition of the best action directors. Taken individually such important elements as the score editing and sound work are quite over-the-top but production values are huge overall and one can scarcely argue that before the plane gets to Vegas everything doesnt jell in a very effective way.

(R. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In the future all movies will be ""Con Air."" The new action thriller which crash- lands today at Bay Area theaters has all the modern virtues violence volume stupidity spectacle for its own sake and supposedly sincere moments that ring so false an audience can only gasp in mockery. But ""Con Air"" anticipates the mockery too and mocks itself. From scene to scene the tone shifts from supposed sincerity to arch and amused until the picture begins to seem like some mad desperate scattershot attempt to hold an audiences attention from moment to moment by any means. Heres the good news/sickening part It kinda sorta succeeds. Viewers might hate themselves in the morning but to hate every moment of ""Con Air"" would take more work than its worth. The picture has its crude charm. Take for example the scene when a corpse is thrown from an airplane and slams down into downtown traffic. No one will mis take it for a scene written by Noel Coward but it is funny folks. ""Con Air"" also has Nicolas Cage going for it. He plays Poe a newly paroled convict who gets on a prison transport plane on his last flight to freedom. This picture has been touted as the one that will determine if Cage can carry a big action picture without Sean Connery. But in fact he has strong support here from John Cusack as a U.S. marshal and John Malkovich as your usual Malkovich maniac. ""Con Air"" is another film that finds its source in a writer stumbling upon some heretofore unexploited aspect of the criminal justice system. Screenwriter Scott Rosenberg (""Things to Do in Denver When Youre Dead"") reportedly read about the prison transport planes and the resulting film plays like one might expect -- a teensy-weensy idea stuffed with two hours of bombast. So the prisoners here are not just prisoners but criminal masterminds. Malkovich plays a killer who also holds a doctorate in jurisprudence. Ving Rhames plays an urban terrorist who is also the author of a book on black nationalism. Best of all theres the heavily shackled and masked child killer who when his face is uncovered turns out to be played by character actor Steve Buscemi. BLASTING SOUNDTRACK When the criminals take over the plane the soundtrack kicks into loud obtrusive gear with a solo guitar singing in the background. The soundtrack by Mark Mancina and rock star Trevor Rabin (Yes) remains so loud throughout the picture that it practically functions as a distancing device. But then theres a lot of distancing in the ""Con Air"" experience. The dialogue for example between Cusack and a hard-nosed government agent played by Colm Meaney is so wretched and sophomoric that it seems less like dialogue than a stand-in for dialogue. Likewise there are the tender moments between Poe and his diabetic buddy (Mykelti Williamson). Its not as if the movie expects us to believe that Poes loyalty to this fellow would keep him from leaving the plane. The friendship isnt vivid enough. These scenes function more as a kind of concession to an action movie audience that has come to expect certain bases to be covered. Before he can go and kill everybody Poe like Rambo needs an all-purpose higher purpose. HARBINGER OF FUTURE FILMS Thats why ""Con Air"" really might be the dismal future of movies. With a unique lack of pretense the picture just goes through the motions laying down its arbitrary context for the big orgasm at the end twenty minutes of nearly nonstop mayhem -- crashes explosions fireballs. Director Simon West making his feature debut films the action as a spectacle of explosions. Its hard to know who is exploding what is exploding or why theyre exploding. Its all noise and fire and madness. And yet however inept the technique has a kind of purity. Someday soon when movies are made up entirely of explosions ""Con Air"" will be remembered as a great step forward. Against this background talking about the acting seems absurd except to say that certain actors blowed up; they blowed up good. Cage is fine. Sometimes his slow somber quality seems out of step with the films madness but his irony helps him keep pace. Whether ""Con Air"" will determine if Cage can make it as an action star isnt the interesting question here. The real question is Why on earth should Cage want to be Sylvester Stallone?

"Con Air | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; con-air ) Con Air (United States 1997) A movie review by James Berardinelli Con Air producer Jerry Bruckheimers generic follow-up to 1996s blockbuster The Rock is the kind of motion picture that critics refer to when they moan about the ""dumbing down"" of American cinema. This movie is a perfect example of whats wrong with many big-budget films today no characters no intelligence and worst of all little fun. Although director Simon West intends for Con Air to be a comic book come to life it lacks the visual flair and imagination of all but the most trite comics. The film relies on impressive pyrotechnic displays but it has been a long time since a well-executed explosion enraptured an audience. Con Air is noisy and flashy but that can be said about any of the numerous same-genre pictures that reach screens every year. What the movie lacks are tension and excitement to go along with all the bangs. The action sequences are presented in a pedestrian fashion and there are too few instances when we feel that the protagonist is in any real danger. Our hero is Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) an ex-Army Ranger and Desert Storm veteran who has spent the last eight years in prison serving a sentence for manslaughter (he accidentally killed a man who was threatening his pregnant wife). Now he has been paroled and hes on his way home to be reunited with his wife and meet his daughter for the first time. One problem the flight hes on is carrying a load of vicious criminals bound for detention at a new prison in Alabama. They get loose and take over the plane and suddenly Cameron finds himself taking orders from Cyrus ""The Virus"" Grissom (John Malkovich) the self-proclaimed ""poster child for the criminally insane."" Meanwhile on the ground a U.S. Marshal named Vince Larkin (John Cusack) is trying to bring the situation to a peaceful conclusion despite interference from a Federal agent (Colm Meaney) who wants to shoot down the plane. At least Con Air isnt as obviously bad as Turbulence. For starters this film has a couple of assets that the earlier ""terror in the sky"" film lacked Nicolas Cage and John Cusack. While the actors are far from their career best here (in fact Cage often looks bored) mediocre acting from these two is preferable to what we got from Ray Liotta and Lauren Holly. Actually the really colorful performances belong to the actors playing the criminals. In addition to Malkovichs predatory Cyrus (a role he could probably do in his sleep) Ving Rhames gives us a nasty black militant named Diamond Dog Jones Steve Buscemi is at his creepy best as The Marietta Mangler and Danny Trejo is a serial rapist with a tattoo on his arm for each of his victims. (Incidentally the movies ambiguous attitude towards Buscemis character a child murderer is disturbing.) Con Air divides the characters into clearly-defined groups of good and bad (with the members of the latter category vastly outnumbering those of the former). Predictably with no shades of gray there isnt one interesting character. Cameron a candidate for sainthood has a spotless record -- even the murder that sent him to prison was justifiable. Hes too clean to be anything but bland and worse still Scott Rosenbergs script doesnt give him any of the one-liners that weve come to expect from action heroes in this sort of movie. Hes like John McLane of Die Hard without the wisecracking charisma. Another thing thats noteworthy about Con Air is how poorly its patched together. In his recent review of the movie Rough Magic film critic Roger Ebert made the observation that ""Its a clichA(c) to talk about great visuals since if you point a camera in the right direction you can make almost anything look good."" Somehow the cinematographer of Con Air (with an assist from the editor) manages to disprove this theory. With the exception of a few nicely composed shots the films look is uniformly stale. Action movies are typically lauded for their tremendous special effects and their ability to keep viewers on the edge of their seats. Con Air falls short in both categories. In fact beyond some scenery-chewing by several over-the-top actors and a couple of mildly engaging chase sequences theres little here to justify the seemingly endless two hour length. Sitting through this movie is like watching a dog running in circles chasing its tail -- the amusement factor dies quickly as the situation become repetitive. Unless youre desperate for a way to kill time Con Air is one flight you can afford to miss.

If Simpson were to get a special afterlife screening of Con Air I have no doubt that hed give it the big thumbs-up. For Con Air a headache in the form of a movie is like an homage to everything Simpson stood for as a producer noise testosterone the glory of wretched excess. This renegade action fantasy which pretends to be about a hijacked plane full of vicious criminals but is really about proving that a movie can pin an audience to the wall with entertainment (call it the cattle-prod school of higher zapping) comes at you as a series of nonstop climaxes. Its so shameless so psychotically nervous about keeping you ""thrilled"" that the phrase over the top wont do it justice. Its like a drug designed for people whove done every drug and now want to be jet-propelled into numbness. The picture is being marketed as a de facto sequel to The Rock the final Simpson-Bruckheimer collaboration (a joke in which the lead villain played by John Malkovich knocks a rock out of the way is featured prominently in the television ads). The Rock in essence was a remake of Die Hard and what gave it its distinctive overwrought garishness was the incoherent splatter- editing technique of director Michael Bay; it was like two hours of confetti exploding in your face. Con Air is a cleaner piece of overkill (at least you can tell whats going on) but it crowds you in a different way. The movie is all sweaty close-ups -- the actors playing goateed sociopaths are framed like mug shots -- and the script by Scott Rosenberg master of the embarrassingly ""hip"" one-liner (hes the one who inflicted the baroque preciousness of Things to Do in Denver When Youre Dead on us) is a knotty pileup of clever-dumb Eastwood/Willis/Arnold aphorisms most of which are too tortured to be funny. (Malkovich to rapist ""If your d-- jumps out of your pants you jump out of this plane"") Nicolas Cage gets right into the you-wont-believe-this- but-then-neither-do-we spirit of it all. As Cameron Poe a decorated Army ranger who has spent eight years in prison on an involuntary manslaughter charge (he was protecting his wife from a barroom bully) and is now flying to freedom on a plane thats carrying nearly a dozen specimens of criminal scum he sports long hippie locks that give him a saintly Christ-gone-Rambo look and he speaks in a noble overdeliberate drawl that makes him even more of a walking put-on than he was as the Elvis-in-snakeskin hipster of Wild at Heart. (He kills but only because he loves.) Cameron doesnt want any trouble but Cyrus ""The Virus"" Grissom (Malkovich) a brilliant mass murderer has engineered an escape. For a while as were introduced to the various convicts the movie is fun in a slick degenerate way; its like a nihilist retread of The Dirty Dozen. But Malkovichs master plan turns out to be an unwieldy bummer. It involves landing the plane in Carson City letting off six men as decoys taking off landing the plane again standing around in the desert and then spending half an hour firing rocket launchers at federal agents. Some of the actors are appealing -- I liked the way Ving Rhames could seem warm and murderous at the same time -- but theyre all playing cliches. Malkovich looking like the late punk-rock ghoul GG Allin does his hostile whining and Steve Buscemi as a serial killer who comes on board in a Hannibal Lecter mask is like a parody of a parody -- hes so calm almost catatonic that its as if the film couldnt be bothered to make him remotely threatening. John Cusack as the U.S. marshal tracking the convicts is as boyish as Cage is ersatz macho. In Con Air all that matters is the next cataclysm the execution-style killings the bomb that goes off in someones face the preposterous climax set aboard a fire truck speeding through Las Vegas the fact that there are not one but two shots of men running toward us in slow motion as the world explodes behind them. Con Air may be the closest thing yet to pure action-thriller pornography. Ultimately theres nothing to it but thrust.
