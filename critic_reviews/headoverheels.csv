Comments Head Over Heels Through a rear window in her Manhattan apartment art restorer Monica Potter spies on neighbor Freddie Prinze Jr. who literally makes her weak in the knees--pratfalls are a big part of this comedy. With the help of her roommates four fashion models Potter keeps an eye on Prinze hoping to learn everything shell need to know about him before an upcoming date. Shes worried about being two-timed or dumped again but this time it seems she may have fallen for a man whose crimes are punishable by law. Though more of the abundant sight gags and slips of the tongue originate in bathrooms and bedrooms than are actually set there the best jokes are on the models and the men who pursue them and Shalom Harlow Ivana Milicevic Sarah OHare and Tomiko Fraser--the real models who play Potters roommates--are very good sports. Mark Waters (The House of Yes) directed a screenplay by Ron Burch and David Kidd; with China Chow. 91 min.

Though the films strenuous play for laughs tends to overshadow its assets it does offer a pair of appealing leads in Monica Potter and Freddie Prinze Jr. Romantic comedy madcap farce and suspense thriller collide in ""Head Over Heels"" a mildly amusing trifle set in Gothams high fashion world. Though the films strenuous play for laughs tends to overshadow its assets it does offer a pair of appealing leads in Monica Potter and Freddie Prinze Jr. attractive eye candy in a quartet of models and a pleasant romantic diversion that should make it easy for Universal to recoup its relatively modest budget. Pic reps the sophomore effort of helmer Mark Waters whose ""House of Yes"" was a Sundance favorite in 1997. But those who appreciated the darkly funny sensibility of his tyro feature will be disappointed by the unabashedly commercial nature of Waters second ""Head Over Heels"" has all the edge and density of a Nerf ball. New pic reteams him with Prinze who in the interim has built a resume as a teen heartthrob in films including ""Shes All That"" and ""Down to You."" Often better than his material Prinze graduates here to an adult role playing Jim Winston the suave and charming fashion consultant who catches the eye of an improbably unlucky-in-love art restorer Amanda Pierce winningly played by Monica Potter. Having taken up residence with four out-of-work models and sworn off men after discovering her boyfriends cheating ways Amanda is duly shocked at her instant attraction to Jim a fellow so fetching that shes weak at the knees whenever they meet; their first encounter is a standard screwball riff in which she stammers and equivocates incessantly. Hes equally smitten with her though a good deal more articulate. So its mighty convenient that Jims apartment is in full view of the one occupied by Amanda and the models who begin to track his rituals document his social life and count his chin-ups. But when Amanda thinks shes seen Jim commit a murder she reports him to the police who find her claim groundless. Drawn to Jim but emotionally conflicted Amanda enlists her model chums to help investigate Jims apartment. That makes for a funny if mostly predictable scene in which Jim returns unexpectedly and the fashion divas hide in his shower after being alerted (from across the courtyard) to his presence. Hitchcock might not be amused at the unapologetic homage to ""Rear Window"" but contempo audiences most certainly will particularly by an off-color ""Dumb and Dumber""-like sequence that finds Jim defecating noisily while the hidden models cringe in horror. Theres even more Farrelly brothers-style scatological humor where that came from as in a superfluous gross-out bit that finds the glamorous gals hiding in a filthy restaurant bathroom stall after spying on Amanda and Jim. The final act resolves -- oh so neatly -- the questions of Jims identity Amandas feelings the alleged murder and the fate of the models careers. The statuesque quartet of Shalom Harlow Ivana Milicevic Sarah OHare and Tomiko Fraser -- supermodels all -- are great sports throughout particularly given that ""Head Over Heels"" paints them as bubbleheaded Amazons. Harlow who revealed a surprising comic sensibility in ""In and Out"" and developed her acting chops in ""Cherry"" is ready for bigger things. As the couple who fall -- yes -- head over heels for each other Potter and Prinze anchor the picture credibly and exchange banter effectively but their courtship suffers from an inordinate number of distracting and redundant pratfalls. Tech values are generally fine throughout though locations are minimal and coverage sometimes feels compromised. The wardrobe which fittingly evokes Seventh Avenue chic couldnt be more flatteringly displayed. Music by Randy Edelman and Steve Porcaro plays a key role in evoking the pics mood shifts; it helps guides the viewer along the precarious transitions from comedy to thriller and back.

(Universal) Occasionally a humorous line or funny sight gag surfaces in ""Head Over Heels"" a romantic comedy starring Freddie Prinze Jr. and Monica Potter. The jokes usually have something to do with anorexia narcissism or obsessive-compulsive desire for cleanliness among the four models who figure as comic relief in the story. There are some other positive things to identify Prinze and Potter are likable and good-natured performers for instance. And heres my favorite part Its only 87 minutes long. But for the most part this movie is just another bland fair-to-middling vehicle for two emerging fledgling stars. Potter plays Amanda a single girl whos shy a little goofy and who just got betrayed by her boyfriend. She moves into an East Side apartment in New York City with four fabulous willowy models (Shalom Harlow Ivana Milicevic Sarah OHare and Tomiko Fraser) who seem to be umbilically connected to one another switching skimpy T-shirts avoiding food and dirty rooms listening to the slavering admiration of male admirers and exchanging airhead pitter-patter. Amanda falls in love with a handsome kinda cross-eyed fella named Jim Winston (Prinze) whos always walking a Great Dane that always knocks her over. The filmmakers find this idea so adorable poor Amanda gets knocked over a good three or four times during the movie. They also make Amanda collapse - literally go weak in the knees - whenever she sets eyes on Jim (usually after picking herself up from the dog attack). Another adorable touch. Amanda who enlists the help of her vacuous roommates becomes convinced that Jims a killer when she apparently witnesses Jim (in silhouette) killing a woman with a baseball bat. The rest of the movie is consumed with her half-believing hes a killer but being unable to resist his charm while those models pursue their own investigation. For cheap measure the movie throws in some pretty gross stuff involving the models crowded into the stall of a mens room two plumbers and a disgusting explosion. Im going to stop now in order to anticipate this conversation at Blockbuster Video in the not-too-distant future as two teenage renters come upon . . . ""Hey Head over Heels. Whats this?"" ""Thats the one with Freddie Prinze Jr."" ""Whos he?"" ""Remember? He was in I Know What You Did Last Summer and Shes All That and Boys and Girls. And remember People magazine voted him . . ."" ""Oh yeah one of the Most Beautiful Whatever. Yeah hes cute. Wait isnt he dating Sarah Michelle Gellar?"" ""That was like a year ago or something. No way would they be dating still."" ""And what about Monica Potter?"" ""Well she was in Patch Adams and she puts like castor oil on her eyelashes and eyebrows to make them thicker."" ""Gross."" ""And Freddie Prinze like plucks his eyebrows every day he says."" ""No way."" ""For sure. I read it on the Internet."" ""Okay lets get it. I want to see if thats really true about her eyebrows."" That would be as good a reason as any. ""Head Over Heels"" (PG-13 87 minutes) - Contains gross-out humor sexual scenes and nudity.

(Universal) Meeting cute takes on a whole new meaning in ""Head Over Heels"" a moronic romantic comedy that gets underway when the heros Great Dane topples the heroine Amanda (appealing Monica Potter) and thereupon demonstrates his mounting interest in her. ""Ive got the runs"" says the gaga Monica who meant to say ""Ive gotta run."" Oopsy. One look at Jim Wilson (fatuous Freddie Prinze Jr.) and shes weak in the knees and mangling her sentences. Though its love at first sight Amanda has been unlucky in love - she caught her previous beau in the act of cheating - and is reluctant to risk another affair. But since Jim lives in the high-rise next door the two - three if you count the dog and we really should - are thrown together again and again. Amanda who restores Renaissance paintings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art has just moved in with four fabulous supermodels (Shalom Harlow Sarah OHare Ivana Milicevic and Tomiko Fraser) whose palatial pad comes with a view of Jims apartment. Amanda is crushed when she glances out the window and thinks she sees Jim commit murder. Now she and her friends must find out the truth. It took four writers to come up with the story which was no doubt pitched as ""Rear Window"" with clothes hangers. With each rewrite it seems things grew fouler duller and more idiotic. The moviemakers go out of their way to parody the leggy ladies but the models stand tall no matter what these brutes throw at them . . . including sewage. (Theyre hiding out in a mens room when a toilet explodes hardy-har-har.) The models good sports to say the least spend a lot of time in toilets. In another instance theyre cowering behind Jims shower curtain gagging and holding their noses as the leading man ascends the throne and breaks the wind barrier. Amanda not privy to the aforementioned scene therefore remains subject to Jims charms. At present she is working on a Titian that is missing a face in the background. She fills the space with a portrait of Jim which the curator deems just perfect. Just when you think this movie couldnt get more ridiculous . . . ""Head Over Heels"" (a blessedly short 87 minutes) is rated PG-13 for bad language horny hounds and off-color humor.

"USATODAY.com - Romance slapped silly Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 02/01/2001 - Updated 0701 PM ET Romance slapped silly By Mike Clark USA TODAY Head Over Heels out of four Stars Monica Potter Freddie Prinze Jr. Sarah OHare Shalom Harlow Ivana Milicevic Director Mark Waters Distributor Universal Rating PG-13 for sexual content crude humor and language With an epic number of knockdowns pratfalls and amorous knee swoons throughout its 87 minutes Head Over Heels is as good a title as any for this Monica Potter comedy. But it feels like a movie some other actress rejected -- you can almost see Sandra Bullock using the screenplay manuscript as a coffee coaster and not caring if she left a brown ring on the title page. The story actually operates on two comic levels and the subsidiary one involving four fashion-model roommates has its moments. Unfortunately the head that flips most of the time belongs to Potter who looks mighty uncomfortable in slapstick situations. Then again if you or I had been the co-star of Patch Adams we probably would have lost our sense of humor too. Potter plays an Iowa transplant who restores museum art in New York City where (as weve been told in so many other movies) there are no available men. She finally thinks she has found one in a fashion-exec neighbor (Freddie Prinze Jr.) whose Great Dane repeatedly attacks her as if hes interested in more than just kissing. But as Potter and her glitzy/ditzy roomies spy on him from their across-the-way apartment they become convinced theyve seen Prinze commit a murder. Whats then attempted according to the films press release is North by Northwest as if Preston Sturges had directed it. (In other words mixing edge-of-your-seat suspense with breathless knockabout farce.) Its an iffy proposition not remotely realized though probably no iffier than having four screenwriters on a movie in the first place (including Ed Decter and John Strauss of Theres Something About Mary). The story sprays in some strange directions and some dark comic stuff about one of the models having been sexually abused by an Australian ""Uncle Pete"" really does sound like the Mary guys. And speaking of spraying one dreadful bathroom scene offers proof that scatological screen humor wont be any less crude in 2001 than it was in 2000 -- though in truth Heels was bumped from last Augusts release schedule. At least the models avarice and teasing provide a chuckle or two as their dates line up panting at the door. Purely by default their contribution makes this a slightly better working-woman romance than The Wedding Planner.

But to see it happen ... to see an actor in his 20s plausibly play a man ... is such a rare occurrence these days that its gratifying. Prinze has charm. He has ease. Women like his looks and men dont find him irritating. Its a pleasure almost to watch him in ""Head Over Heels"" and a pleasure almost to watch Monica Potter play Amanda an insecure art restorer who goes for him in a big way. Its also a pleasure to hear the Go-Gos song ""Head Over Heels"" play over the theater sound system. But now were scraping the bottom of the pleasure barrel. ""Head Over Heels"" is light stuff the cinematic equivalent of the airy wax paper that separates cold cuts on a delicatessen scale. Its as close to nothing as anything could be while still being something. Poor Amanda just cant get lucky with men. She comes home and finds her boyfriend in bed with another woman. ""This is not what it looks like"" he says. So she moves out and moves into an apartment with four models -- ""the last four nonsmoking models in New York"" -- who are all very tall very thin and very self-involved. From its opening moments there is something off about ""Head Over Heels"" something tin-eared in its humor and disjointed in its structure. In the movies first moments we find out that Amandas sexy co-worker (China Chow) is a lesbian. Theres no reason for her to be a lesbian except that all movies are supposed to have one these days. She appears in two scenes and then disappears for about an hour. The models are played by real-life models Sarah OHare Shalom Harlow Ivana Milicevic and Tomiko Fraser and the picture seems in part to be a satire of the modeling world. Certainly the models are there and so are the modeling jokes. Yet the real concerns of the picture lie in another direction entirely. The most disconcerting thing about ""Head Over Heels"" is no fault of the filmmakers and yet its such an unavoidable part of the experience that it has to be noted. A running joke throughout the film involves Amandas getting repeatedly pounced on and knocked flat by a huge dog. With the tragedy of the Pacific Heights dog attack fresh in the minds of Bay Area audiences these moments dont produce a laugh but a collective shudder. Thats how Amanda meets Jim (Prinze) -- the dog he is walking gets loose and knocks her down. Its love at first sight. Its also love at second and third sight when Amanda realizes that she can see right into Jims apartment from her living-room window. Like everyone else in the history of motion pictures Jim doesnt own curtains and almost never pulls down the shades. The one time he does it looks from the shadows as if he is committing a murder. So Amanda is kind of iffy about whether she should keep their date. Director Mark Waters walked a fine line in his directorial debut the superb but largely ignored ""House of Yes."" He found the right balance between naturalism and surrealism comedy and drama seriousness and absurdity and he made a movie that will last (if anyone ever bothers to see it). In ""Head Over Heels"" the challenge was to make a thriller that was also a farce that was also a romantic comedy. Perhaps Preston Sturges could have managed it -- but only with a Preston Sturges script. In ""Head Over Heels"" Waters is working with nothing with air with an all- over-the-place screenplay by Ron Burch and David Kidd. Amanda is presented as a klutz banging into things and falling down. The model played by OHare is also a klutz banging into things and falling down. These screenwriters have only so many personality types to go around. This isnt to say ""Head Over Heels"" is without its moments; its just that moments are all it has. When a flustered Amanda says ""I got the runs"" when she means to say ""I gotta run"" thats funny. Or at least Potter makes it funny. Sort of. Advisory This film contains violence.

Waters; Author Ron Burch Ed Decker David Kidd John J. Strauss; Producer (group) Universal; Release Date Wide 02/02/2001; Runtime (in minutes) 127; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Universal Posted February 9 2001 -- 1200 AM EST Head Over Heels is the sort of movie in which two people make love in front of a fire thats roaring away on a television screen and the prefab video blaze isnt even meant to be ironic. Amanda (Monica Potter) a lovelorn art restorer moves in with four obnoxious fashion models who give her a makeover not because she isnt pretty enough but because she has to learn to view life through the glam mask of a gold-digging power babe. Even under the excess blush and powder though her sweetness shines through -- at least it does to Jim (Freddie Prinze Jr.) the fashion executive who lives across the way. Jim is a sweet guy himself or so it appears until Amanda gazes through the window and catches what looks like her new crush doing something more unsavory than shed counted on. The notion of an actor as innocuous as Prinze playing a possible bad guy is a paper-thin gimmick but its all there is to Head Over Heels. By the time his nature is revealed the film has gone from bland to dismal. Potter however who has a moonstruck glow deserves a romantic comedy less fake than that fire.
