What if one of the Saddams of the world got their hands on this? asks a concerned official. But this being a comedy fantasy levelled at tweenies the watch falls into the hands of adolescent Zak (Bradford) who uses it to impress Venezuelan exchange student Francesca before the pair are tracked down by Earls malevolent bosses. Contemporary references include internet auctions a punk pop soundtrack DJ battles and innovative paintball techniques but although the flow motion SFX are fun the film directed by an old Star Trek hand seems resolutely stuck in the 80s.

Starring Arliss Howard Paul Le Mat Debra Winger. (R. 111 minutes. At the Lumiere and Rafael). Debra Winger in her first film role in six years doesnt appear all that often in ""Big Bad Love."" But when she does her no-nonsense presence provides a break from the parade of Southern eccentrics and disjointed images in the admirably ambitious but self-indulgent directing debut of her husband Arliss Howard. Winger plays the nurse ex-wife of Howards failed writer character a hard- drinkin Virgil-quotin deadbeat dad avoiding his ex and his slightly crazy mama played by Angie Dickinson. Its all too precious especially Rosanna Arquettes debauched debutante doing her gardening in a satin dress and bouffant. But Howard who co-wrote the script based on the stories of Mississippi writer Larry Brown is a good enough actor and director to keep the film afloat for long stretches. Hes an appealing presence even if hes overly reliant on a slouch and cigarette dangling from his lips. His face shows real torment and frustration making an irresponsible lout into a sympathetic character. The guy is supposed to be a Vietnam vet but its hard to attach an era to the pictures wastrel elegance of hick intellectuals driving dirt roads in beat-up pickup trucks. Howard also seems a little young to have fought in Vietnam. As a director he produces a string of evocative images from a wide shot of a dog lazing on a porch to Dickinsons face in an extreme close-up. The activity of writing is not very cinematic but he makes it so with voice-over readings and shots of pages flying in the wind. Howard eventually goes overboard muddling the narrative with a mishmash of fantasy and flashback sequences. Curiously all the showiness comes to a alt when Winger comes onscreen. Her husband seems to know that with a face like hers no trickery is required. . This film contains raw language sexual situations and nudity. -- Carla Meyer BAY OF ANGELS . Romance. Starring Jeanne Moreau and Claude Mann. Directed and written by Jacques Demy. (Not rated. 79 minutes. In French with English subtitles. Today through Thursday at the Castro April 16-18 at the Rafael Film Center in San Rafael.) . In his 1963 film ""Bay of Angels"" French filmmaker Jacques Demy took the light piquant romanticism of his first film ""Lola"" and gave it an edge by casting Jeanne Moreau in the lead role. Playing Jackie a peroxided hustler and gambling addict who loses and wins millions at the roulette table Moreau is one of the most watchable of screen goddesses. Pretty mercurial and perverse Jackie is a smooth operator exuding ersatz glamour and I-dont-give-a-damn sophistication. Like any great object of desire Moreau has a gift for drawing us in and then keeping us at a safe distance wondering whats percolating beneath the surface. Demy shot ""Bay of Angels"" in dreamy black and white and set his simple pared-down tale in the casinos of Nice and St. Tropez. Jean (Claude Mann) a young bank employee and gambling neophyte falls into Jackies perfumed trap and mistakes the adrenaline of chance for the rumblings of love. Blessed with one of the great cinematic faces Moreau can sparkle and entice in one instant and then with a downward turn of that quarter-moon mouth transform herself into a cold surly caution. Her character is a grifter -- an actress on the stage of her own life -- and Moreau does a brilliant job of capturing her vain self-awareness. Its in the toss of her platinum mane the way she exhales cigarette smoke with theatrical elan and the arrogant queenly roll of her hips as she enters a casino. There are great pleasures as well in Michel Legrands score and Jean Rabiers fluid evocative photography of the Cote dAzur but nothing to compare with Moreaus magnificent insolence. -- Edward Guthmann CLOCKSTOPPERS Action comedy. Starring Jesse Bradford and Paula Garces. Directed by Jonathan Frakes. (PG. 92 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . The fun of ""Clockstoppers"" is that it has a catchy sci-fi gimmick and the special effects to back it up. The disadvantage is that the gimmick is contained within a sour story that never quite engages the viewer. The result is mixed bag an intermittently pleasing but mostly routine effort. The movie revolves around a wristwatch capable of stopping time or so it seems. The wearer -- and anyone touching him -- enter ""hypertime"" in which their molecules speed up to such a degree that people stuck in regular time seem almost as though theyre standing still. The only memorable scene in ""Clockstoppers"" is the one in which young Zak (Jesse Bradford) and his girlfriend (Paula Garces) realize the watchs capabilities. They look at a bee and see its wings slowly flapping. They touch the still beads of water flowing out from a sprinkler. Then wonder gives way to mischief and they go to the town square and pull pranks on people such as the meter maid. These scenes are amusing and nicely realized. The shot of the young woman brushing her hand through the beads of water even has a poetry to it. But sooner or later in every movie a plot must kick in and when it happens in ""Clockstoppers"" the mood is spoiled. An evil government contractor (Michael Biehn) wants the watch and hes willing to kill anyone to get it. The result Our young hero spends half the movie getting chased and the other half chasing the contractors. Director Jonathan Frakes found himself in a box with this one. Since the movie is in essence a teen romp he couldnt portray the threat to the kids with anything like harsh realism. At the same time there could be no disguising the essential grimness of the story. ""Clockstoppers"" might have been a much more jolly ride had the two teenagers not had to spend so much time talking about how they might be murdered any second. -- Mick LaSalle NO SUCH THING Horror-comedy. Starring Sarah Polly Robert John Burke Helen Mirren and Julie Christie. Directed and written by Hal Hartley. (Rated R. 102 minutes. At the Opera Plaza.) . Pert and pigtailed and open to new experience Beatrice (Sarah Polley) is the sacrificial lamb in Hal Hartleys ""No Such Thing"" a contemporary fairy tale that ponders the possibility of demons in our world. When her journalist boyfriend disappears in Iceland and Beatrice volunteers to find him were clearly in Red Riding Hood/Big Bad Wolf territory. An uneasy mixture of tragedy satire monster yarn and David Cronenberg creepiness ""No Such Thing"" cant decide what it wants to be or how it needs to get there. The tone is chilly and depersonalized and the metaphors and genre pricks dont mesh but theres redemptive value in performances by Polley Helen Mirren as a soulless tabloid-TV producer and Julie Christie as a sympathetic doctor. The Monster (Robert John Burke) is a bitter indestructible creature with long horns billy-goat chin and scaly ""Creature From the Black Lagoon"" skin. He speaks perfect English kills everyone he meets and wants to die. Every beast needs a beauty to tame his ravaged soul so when Mirren looks for a staff member to fly to Iceland and seek out the Monster its perky Beatrice who comes forward. First she survives a mid-Atlantic plane crash and is saved by Christie (who emanates such kindness that one can only mourn her scant screen time). Hartley never gets a firm grasp on this material and when he references ""King Kong"" by bringing the Monster back to New York where hes abused and treated as a freak"" the film loses its tragic edge. It becomes a goofy lampoon of predatory journalism -- one in which Mirren the most impeccable of actresses seems to overact because of the vague direction shes been given. . This movie contains violence and raw language. -- Edward Guthmann.

"Clockstoppers Out of Sync washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Clockstoppers Out of Sync Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday March 29 2002 ""CLOCKSTOPPERS"" is a benign but forgettable sci-fi diversion about a kid named Zak (Jesse Bradford) who stumbles on a wristwatch with the power to stop time. Actually what the device co-developed by his college professor/mad scientist father (Robin Thomas) really does is accelerate the molecular activity of the wearer to such a degree that everything and everyone else only appear to be motionless. Theyre still moving just verrry slowly relative to the speed of the person who entered whats known as ""hypertime."" What this means is that the main attraction of the film is the admittedly rather cool special effect known as ""stereoscopic freeze"" in which the camera and in this case the characters who have entered hypertime appear to be able to walk among and around the sluggish occupants of an unmoving world. Although its given a workout here the effect is nothing we havent seen in countless other films and television commercials over the last four years or so and its precious little to base a feature film on. Still the concept fleshed out by screenwriters Rob Hedden J. David Stem and David N. Weiss is an entertaining one and the direction by Jonathan Frakes (Will Riker on ""Star Trek The Next Generation"" and director of a couple of ""Star Trek"" films) is brisk. Complicating matters in the initially rather confusing plot are two things. First is the fact that the technology also happens to have fallen into the hands of the evil QT Corporation whose minions (led by the glibly despicable Michael Biehn) are reluctant to hand over the hardware to the National Security Agency. The NSA it seems justifiably fears that the watches could enable terrorists to plant bombs undetected. The other little difficulty is something refered to as the ""aging glitch."" In short if you wear the watch for two weeks of real time around 20 years of hypertime can elapse messing up your retirement plan considerably. Needless to say the baddies at QT are eager to fix this snag kidnapping Zaks dad and his student Doppler (an antic French Stewart) and forcing them to find a solution before the feds confiscate their equipment. In rides Zak as the cavalry accompanied by a Venezuelan transfer-student hottie played by Paula Garces and mounted on mountain bike instead of horse. As our teenage hero Bradford has a slack and nonthreatening charm and his sidelong smirksmile is sure to appeal to the target audience of this Nickelodeon Movies production which seems aimed toward everyone from the Happy Meal demographic to the early teenage crowd. And if the 22-year-old actors heavy 5 oclock shadow visible in several shots belies his characters adolescence maybe were meant to chalk that up to the um ""aging glitch"" - even though Zak only enters hypertime for a few minutes at a time. Consistency and internal logic - normally so important in sci-fi films in which the manipulation of time plays a major role - are pretty much out the window here. I spotted numerous instances in which things just dont add up such as the first scene where Zak meets Doppler. Although both appear to be moving in hypertime only one is wearing the wristwatch. But the only people who will care about that technical stuff (like making sense) are boring old you-know-whats like me. CLOCKSTOPPERS (PG 94 MINUTES) - Contains car-chase violence and unsafe mountain biking. Area theaters.

USATODAY.com - Clockstoppers spins a pleasant tale of time Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 03/29/2002 - Updated 0853 AM ET Clockstoppers spins a pleasant tale of time By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Clockstoppers (out of four) Stars Jesse Bradford Paula Garces French Stewart Julia Sweeney Rating PG for action violence and mild language Clockstoppers trailer Time travel is a tried-and-true movie conceit. Filmmakers who decide to go that route need to come up with an original twist on the genre if they want to keep us interested. Clockstoppers tries and winds up with a pleasant if forgettable romp of a film. The predictable plot is aided by the films enthusiastic and attractive lead Jesse Bradford (the young boy in the wonderful Steven Soderbergh film King of the Hill now grown up). Zak (Bradford) is a good young man if a bit of an underachiever. His biggest concern has been saving up to buy a car. His father (Robin Thomas) is a workaholic science professor who thinks Zak should spend more time on his schoolwork. In his haste before a conference the absent-minded professor leaves a scientific invention that looks like an ordinary wristwatch lying on his desk. The watch allows the wearer to experience hypertime a speedier version of real life but of course its not perfected. Zak innocently puts it on and begins a time-traveling adventure accompanied by a foreign exchange student Francesca (Paula Garces). We learn that people in normal time cant see people in hypertime because their molecules are moving too fast. And people in hypertime regard people in normal time as virtually standing still because their molecules are moving at such a slower rate. Fortunately thats about it for the science lesson. Still the movie doesnt take full advantage of the inventions potential. Zak and Francesca use the watch to exact creative revenge on a bully a too-punctual meter maid and a graffiti tagger. But they quickly get diverted when the movie devolves into a formulaic story Boy and girl must fight a mysterious evil syndicate that could destroy the world. The villains nab the science prof and his son must save him. In the process father and son settle their differences and grow closer. Clockstoppers rises above movies with similarly familiar plots. Even though romance buds between Zak and Francesca the movie remains mindful of its family-friendly rating and the goings-on are pretty innocent. And even when the movie veers off in a junior James Bond direction the action generally is violence-free. Its fairly refreshing to see a movie starring teens that avoids gross-out humor unlike Sorority Boys or American Pie. And at only 94 minutes Clockstoppers wont make parents who arent riveted by the film feel that time has come to a crashing halt.

The trouble is the characters get virtually nothing to do with their newfound power. Before long the chintzy miracle of hypertime all but drops out of the movie until it feels like were watching a super-early rough cut of Spy Kids in which they havent yet gotten around to adding the special effects. Clockstoppers stops time all right--it stretches 94 minutes into something that feels like infinity.
