By David Edelstein You can read a longer review (if one is available) by clicking the title of the movie or by searching our archives. Advertisement Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones. It opens with a scary act of sabotage and an aerial-hot-rod chase amid futuristic skyscrapers a happy reminder of the Saturday-matinee serials out of which this saga was born. Mostly though the giddiness of the first Star Wars trilogy is gone replaced by turgid pageantry tricked to life with gargantuan amounts of computer-generated busyness. Apart from campy interjections during action sequences the tone throughout is solemnly portentous the diction public even in private the characters aquiver with a patrician sense of duty. George Lucas is attempting nothing less than an epic saga of the corruption of Anakin Skywalker (the future Darth Vader)--a project more ambitious in its way than Lawrence ofArabia (1963). But his grasp of character politics and for that matter filmmaking remains on the level of Flash Gordon. The Triumph of Love. Clare Peploes adaptation of Marivauxs 1732 comedy juggles the language of theater and cinema more buoyantly than anything since Ingmar Bergmans The Magic Flute. The play itself isnt the thing but it will do A midsummer romantic cross-dressing romp its satiric target is fear of feeling its aim the conciliation of reason and emotion its most obvious antecedent As You Like It. Employing a hand-held 16-millimeter camera Peploe finds the perfect perspective for every scene Now she pulls back and the actors play it big so you can feel their relish for showy theatrical artifice; now she comes in close using jump cuts creating a nervous intimacy possible only in movies. As a self-serious philosopher and his spinster sister Ben Kingsley and Fiona Shaw are the most perfect commedia stooges imaginable. And who would have thought that Mira Sorvino could look like a classically trained actress? Changing Lanes.Taut morality play about two men who after a fender bender that leaves each of them compromised engage in a compulsive tit-for-tat revenge scenario. The point of view is deeply liberal-humanist with the sort of social conscience you rarely encounter in a modern American thriller It could be the cornerstone of a Vigilantes Anonymous. Director Roger Michells tight framing reinforces the high psychological stakes and the performances are smart and focused. Even Ben Affleck comes through butting up against his own limitations to convey his characters sudden helplessness. Human Nature. The title suggests that the picture is going to be a little generic and there isnt really a plot per se--just a setup and a lot of jokes. But the French-financed film from a script by Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malkovich) is often a riot and the psycho-farce sensibility is all there. The struggle here is nominally between civilization and animal instinct neither entirely hospitable to human nature; but the central characters have been so thoroughly screwed up by parents that its hard to imagine them comfortable in any realm human or wild. Dull performances by Tim Robbins and Patricia Arquette but a star-making turn by Rhys Ifans. Advertisement Frailty. Bill Paxtons directorial debut is a weird but unnerving little horror stunt a piece of Grand Guignol religiosity thats like a blend of The TexasChainsaw Massacre and Breaking the Waves. On the proverbial dark and stormy night a man (Matthew McConaughey) shows up at the Dallas office of the FBI agent (Powers Boothe) in charge of a serial-killer hunt to announce that his brother--who has just committed suicide--is the culprit. He goes on recount the story of his loving dad (Paxton) an auto mechanic who regarded himself as Gods executioner and the tortured relationship between the son who thought his father was nuts and the son who believed with all his heart. Spider-Man. At its best Sam Raimis adaptation of the 60s Marvel Comic (from a script by David Koepp) takes the adolescent yearning at the heart of most superhero sagas and gives it a lovely swing. In part this is thanks to Tobey Maguire who has a wary uninsistent presence. He internalizes everything which is perfect for a character who doesnt have any awareness of his body until a genetically altered spider sinks its fangs into him and he delights in his new muscles and sticky excretions. Maguire has a shy delicate rapport with Kirsten Dunst as the sexy girl-next-door but less chemistry with Willem Dafoe whos awful as the jet-surfing Green Goblin. At key intervals the movie gives way to a video game in which a cartoon man in a spider suit swings along the avenues. This is the rare comic-book blockbuster thats better in the scenes without special effects. Y Tu Mama Tambien. Alfonso Cuarons terrific new film is a teen sex comedy astride a grave. Whats marvelous isnt its uninhibited carnal gropings its narrators persistently sociopolitical interjections or even its storyline in which two horny teen-age boys embark on a road trip to a beach paradise with a 30ish woman who ends up teaching them a lesson about the impermanence of life. Its all of the above. Its the weave. Its the way Cuaron demonstrates how a simple love triangle can suddenly blossom into a study of sexual mores a political allegory a song of lamentation--and still be breezy and funny and sexy as hell. Blade II. Just when you thought that televisions wonderful Buffy the Vampire Slayer had used up all the martial-arts ways of vaporizing vampires heres Guillermo del Toros savagely kinetic splatterfest to open your eyes. Blade is back and this time hes helping the vampires fend off an even more demonic race--bald eastern-European types whose heads spit open to reveal ... some gunky sucking stuff. An allegory of blacks and Jews? Hope not. Theres no script to speak of but del Toro devises every battle to wow even the most jaded martial-arts mavens; the dissolutions and implosions are beautiful. Monsoon Wedding. Director Mira Nair shot this teeming ensemble comedy (set in Delhi) cheaply and fast but the gorgeous colors and music and swirling silks leave you with a feeling of riches. There is a theme--how an elaborate Punjabi wedding ceremony seems out of sync with the societys increasingly Westernized mores. But dont let that scare you off; its mostly pitched at the level of Fiddler on the Roof with lots of singing dancing and other conventions imported from the effervescent ""Bollywood"" genre.

With Wesley Snipes Kris Kristofferson Ron Perlman. Directed by Guillermo del Toro. Running time 108 mins. Rated R Strong pervasive violence; language drug use. 1/2 Star. The most interesting thing about Guillermo del Toros ""Blade II"" - a slaughterthon involving one human one half-human/half-vampire hordes of purebred vampires and emerging swarms of super-leeches called Reapers - is the way the villains die. When Blade (Wesley Snipes) the half-human vampire hero from the Marvel comic kills a vampire the poor creature lights up like a jack-o-lantern explodes then disappears in a cloud of sparks. Its no wonder Blade spends every waking minute hunting them down and bumping them off. Their screaming deaths are more colorful than a box of cheap fireworks. Id be hard-pressed to estimate the number of vampires and Reapers who make these spectacular exits. More than 100 less than a million. There are at least enough to get you over the thrill of destruction past that nagging sense of revulsion and into a zone of shocked indifference. Though the plot hinges on a threat against all mankind theres only one significant human being in the movie and hes perpetually stoned a condition we come to envy. Dark ugly and delirious describes the esthetic of ""Blade II"" in which Blade his human sidekick Scud (Norman Reedus) and his mentor-turned-vampire Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) form a partnership with a team of vampire commandos to destroy the mutant Reapers. Key among the vampire allies are Reinhardt (Ron Perlman) a sadistic killer with Blade in his sights and Nyssa (Leonor Varela) the agreeable daughter of evil vampire ruler Damaskinos (Thomas Kretschmann). The character development doesnt get in the way of the comic-book mandate which is constant violence. If youll permit me a logical challenge if there are no visible people in the world inhabited by these armies of vampires and Reapers whose blood are they drinking? And what keeps Blades corpuscles in shape? He doesnt consume so much as a chicken sandwich and yet he can leap and kick like the girls of ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" and is otherwise invincible. Del Toro (""Cronos"") is a stylish horrormeister and he has created an evocative foreboding atmosphere. But only a fan of this kind of mayhem could find a way into the story. And only a critic sworn to serve could stick it out to the end. Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

The most chilling thing about this wildly violent and life-draining sequel is the prospect of millions of moviegoers watching it in a state of stupefaction. Or worse still since theres always an audience for such stuff in a state of satisfied stupefaction. You may wonder why Im giving it space on the front page of this august section but its one of those weeks that point up the vast imbalance between mass-market junk and movies of quality that can barely be found. ""Blade II"" is rolling out today on 2700 screens across the nation while the only other opening of significance a superb film from Argentina called ""Son of the Bride"" is starting on a total of six screens two in New York and four in Los Angeles (though it will wend its way to more cities in the coming weeks). The original ""Blade"" released in 1998 was bloody and lurid but entertaining on its own terms as a stylized and stylish vehicle for the Marvel Comics character one of the first African-American comic-book superheroes. Blade played then and now by Wesley Snipes is half human and half vampire. A conflicted creature to say the least he Jekylls around without fear of sunlight or garlic but Hydes an unslakable thirst for the fruit of the vein. Back then Mr. Snipes was a glowering scourge of vampires trying to take over the country. Now still sporting a bulletproof leather version of a doormans greatcoat he has become a pouty grump who gets recruited or co-opted by the vampires themselves. They want him to take on a threat to them and to humankind alike -- a race of super-vampires the Reapers with ravenous appetites and hideous jaws that make Jaws look like a vegan. ""Blade II"" was shot in Prague and was directed by Guillermo del Toro a filmmaker who brought real distinction to the horror genre last year with ""The Devils Backbone."" (He also played unsettling vampire games in the 1993 feature ""Cronos."") Mr. del Toro makes as much as one can of all the slaughter and mastication and the movie looks like something dramatic is going on thanks in large part to the cinematographer Gabriel Beristain and the production designer Carol Spier. But no one seems to be having much fun with the possible exception of Kris Kristofferson who is back as Blades venerable human sidekick Whistler. The film finds few variations on the themes of run kick chomp and gulp. The most memorable joke in the joyless script is when Blade asks someone if hes human and the guy replies ""Barely. Im a lawyer."" The most memorable surprise comes midway through the story when the action descends into Pragues sewers. I thought wed been there all the time. Son of the Bride Dont be fooled by the sitcommy title of ""Son of the Bride."" Argentinas Academy Award nominee for best foreign language film is a drama of rare distinction and wonderfully funny in the bargain. The son of the title Rafa is a middle-aged restaurant owner whos literally killing himself with work and anxiety. Hes played by Ricardo Darin and if theres a stronger braver performance in any recent film I havent come across it. The bride is Rafas aged mother Norma whose memory is being spirited away by Alzheimers; shes played by the magnificent Norma Aleandro. Rafas story is intertwined with that of his mother and his father Nino (Hector Alterio who was also Ms. Aleandros husband in the 1985 Oscar winner ""The Official Story""). After 40 years of marriage Nino decides that its time to fulfill Normas dream of a church wedding and the old man enlists Rafas help in what proves to be a spiritual journey with interludes of inspired farce. Rafas self-inflicted torment gives the story its spine but the wedding plans -- along with another signal event youll discover for yourself -- bring him around to making peace with his parents and with himself. If this sounds formulaic be assured that the director Juan Jose Campanella and his co-writer Fernando Castets have a fondness for sly anarchy and a gift for turning solid seemingly straightforward scenes into brilliant explosions of language and feeling. One of those scenes begins with a fatuous priest telling Nino that God is neither black nor white. ""No thats Michael Jackson"" he replies and then rages against the church with glorious eloquence when the priest dismisses Ninos marriage request. In another scene Rafa makes a furious speech of beseechment to -- or rather through -- an apartment buildings security camera. And if ""Son of the Bride"" is starting to sound like a star vehicle be assured that its a movie with a fine ensemble cast. Rafas lovely and vulnerable girlfriend Nati is played by Natalia Verbeke whose spirit and grace I praised in a review of last years American independent comedy ""Jump Tomorrow."" His old friend Juan Carlos a charming eccentric who shows up out of the blue like a good fairy or guardian angel is played by Eduardo Blanco a dead ringer for Roberto Benigni. For a while I thought Mr. Blanco was Roberto Benigni whose work I generally abhor and I couldnt imagine how hed mustered such subtlety and restraint. Its surprising to find subtlety in a film that flies off in so many unexpected directions but Mr. Campanella and his colleagues are masters of tender moments and small gestures as well as comic flamboyance. Its been a long while since weve been treated to an encounter like the one between mute Norma and her son who still needs his mothers approval still wants to be known by a woman who may no longer know of herself. Or a wedding ceremony as quietly wacky and at the same time mysteriously beautiful. Heaven only knows what the bride is thinking when she looks at her groom and gently caresses his wizened face. VIDEO TIP When you think of ""Five Easy Pieces"" the 1970 drama that Bob Rafelson directed from Carole Eastmans screenplay one of the first things that comes to mind is Jack Nicholsons hilarious chicken-salad-sandwich speech. But Mr. Nicholsons Bobby Dupea also has a wrenching encounter with a mute parent -- his father a stroke victim who can only listen to Bobbys apology for his misspent life.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet A good example of a cant-miss proposition that missed by a wide margin 1998s Blade had all the makings of a terrific B-movie from its comic-book pedigree to its elaborate vampire mythology to Wesley Snipes Shaft-meets-Blacula protagonist. A surprise hit it was nowhere near as much fun as it should have been mainly because it took itself way too seriously a problem epitomized by Snipes humorless lead performance. Snipes returns to vampire-slaying duty in Blade II and while he still cuts a grim figure hes surrounded by a film thats everything Blade should have been but wasnt stylish fast-paced and comfortable with its own ridiculousness. Taking place two years after the original Blade II finds Snipes half-human half-vampire warrior fighting a new enemy a vampiric super-sect so dangerous and feared that even the malevolent vampire establishment wants it destroyed. Having devoted his life to fighting vampires Snipes is understandably reluctant to aid his hated foes but agrees to help destroy the new breed before it can take over the earth. Kris Kristofferson returns to play gruff-old-coot mentor to Snipes semi-undead cowboy and theyre joined by a scene-stealing Norman Reedus as Snipes stoner sidekick and Ron Perlman as an arrogant vampire who battles with Snipes for alpha-vampire status. Blade IIs dialogue tends toward the arbitrary but its spiked with occasional bursts of wit. The combative relationship between Perlman and Snipes likewise gives the film a much-needed injection of droll humor while Kristofferson and Reedus make striking impressions with minimal screen time. The films plot functions as little more than a loose framework for impressive setpieces and energetically choreographed martial-arts sequences but director Guillermo del Toro (The Devils Backbone Mimic) keeps things moving so quickly and looking so good that it barely matters. The world can always use another entertainingly trashy B-movie and Blade II fits the bill.

Whatever the reason vampires are among the movie industrys boogeymen of choice leaving many a multiplex littered with the rotting corpses of bad horror flicks. ""Blade II"" is a better vampire movie than recent entries such as ""Queen of the Damned"" or ""Dracula 2000."" That said Wesley Snipes return as slayer of the undead still is fairly anemic relying on blood glossy effects high-kicking combat and a head-banging soundtrack rather than authentic chills and scares. Advertisement If you liked the original ""Blade"" based on the Marvel comic book youll probably like the sequel which director Guillermo del Toro injects with a similar quotient of action and gore and an even higher body count. If the idea behind the first movie -- a half-man half-vampire hero waging a blood feud against a race of full-blooded vampires -- made you want to giggle then its best to whistle on past ""Blade II."" As with the first film the only way to get through ""Blade II"" is if theres complete disconnection of that part of the brain that determines when something is really really silly. Give the premise the slightest critical thought while watching Snipes disintegrate vampires with his bottomless pistol of silver bullets (or stare too long at Snipes manicured-hedgerow hair) and youll likely suffer a demonic fit of the snickers. The sequel opens explosively with Blade rampaging through legions of bloodsuckers in a mission to rescue his mentor Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) who seemingly died in the first movie after being infected with the ""vampire virus."" Turns out Whistlers being kept alive by Blades vampire enemies. Reunited Blade and Whistler return to their he-man vampire-haters club headquarters manned by Blades high-tech geek ally Scud (Norman Reedus). Theyre reluctantly drawn into an alliance with the vampire overlord (Thomas Kretschmann) his daughter Nyssa (Leonor Varela) and their crack assassination unit the Bloodpack to fight a new breed of super-vampires that threatens humans and regular bloodsuckers. What follows is a series of overlong setups where Blade and his confederates skulk around dank halls waiting to be attacked by the mega-vampires called Reapers. The visual effects are a big advancement over the original ""Blade"" though while watching vampires dissolve in showers of sparks is cool the first four or five times its deadly dull the 20th. Snipes Kristofferson and Perlman manage as much charisma as they can from a story that leaves little room for anything but alpha-vampire posturing.

Genre fans likely will respond in sanguine fashion to the literal and figurative overkill in ""Blade II"" an aggressively over-the-top followup to the hit 1998 comicbook adaptation toplining Wesley Snipes as an eponymous anti-hero whos half-human half-vampire and all business when it comes to battling bloodsuckers. Director Guillermo del Toro evokes the lurid pulpiness of his ""Mimic"" rather than the understated spookiness of his ""The Devils Backbone"" as he injects fresh blood into the franchise. But pic may be too grisly to extend its appeal beyond its fan base and it could fade faster than Dracula at daybreak after posting solid opening-week numbers. But it likely will stake out immortality as a cult-fave homevid. Snipes once again provides the proper amount of ultracool gravitas as he slices dices shoots and scores in the title role. For the benefit of those who tuned in late scripter David S. Goyer (also returning from the original) provides a brisk precis of characters backstory. Years ago Blades pregnant mother was bitten by a vampire shortly before giving birth to him. The mix of human and vampire blood resulted in a hybrid offspring -- or to use vampire parlance a ""daywalker"" -- who has all of the powers and none of the weaknesses associated with the undead. Blade has devoted his life to ridding the world of suck-heads (his epithet of choice) like the monster that claimed his mama. Trouble is sooner or later he may develop a resistance to the serum that stifles his sanguinary cravings. Del Toro fashions ""Blade II"" as a neo-noir adventure that combines the bold visual style of comicbook storytelling with the frenetically acrobatic mayhem of a Hong Kong action film. Blade himself is a Batmanly figure in cool shades and black-on-black bulletproof attire armed with devices more lethal than anything in the Caped Crusaders utility belt In addition to silver spikes and silver-tipped bullets his arsenal includes a booby-trapped samurai sword hypodermics filled with liquid garlic -- and most prominently knife-edged boomerangs. But wait theres more Del Toro ups the action quotient by employing Hong Kong fight master Donnie Yen (""Iron Monkey"") as co-star and fight choreographer and occasionally increases the film speed to give some scenes the look and feel of Japanese anime. Probably the smartest move is resuscitating Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) Blades grizzled mentor and weapons designer who appeared to be seriously dead at the end of the first ""Blade."" Kristoffersons drawling sass provides a nicely sarcastic counterpoint to the fast-and-furious action. In ""Blade II"" Blade is pitted against undead overlord Damaskinos (Thomas Kretschmann). But Damaskinos proposes a temporary alliance with Blade to defeat a common enemy a super-race of vampires known as Reapers who feast on suck-heads and humans. The forces of darkness are led by Nomak (Luke Goss) a ghastly nightcrawler who resembles the title bogeyman of F.W. Murnaus ""Nosferatu"" and whose lower jaw easily expands into insectlike mandibles. (All the better to bite you with my dear.) To nip the Reapers in the bud Blade reluctantly joins forces with a Blood Pack soldier-vampires originally trained to hunt and destroy him. Reinhardt (Ron Perlman) leader of the pack obviously shouldnt be trusted. Theres only slightly more doubt about the sincerity of Nyssa (Leonor Varela) another of Blades temporary allies who just happens to be Damaskinos daughter. Filmed on appropriately spooky and/or decrepit locations in and around Prague in the Czech Republic ""Blade II"" proceeds at the pace of a silver bullet sometimes at the expense of narrative clarity. The borderline-chaotic fight scenes set to a deafeningly loud rap-rock/heavy metal score are directed and edited for maximum kinetic impact. A few extend way past the point of comfort but the overall effect is more exhilarating than exhausting. Special effects -- including of course the depiction of disintegrating vampires -- are uninspired but effective. Snipes acquits himself with unforced authority and a smidgen of self-mockery as he reprises his guns-and-poses performance of ""Blade."" Supporting players of note include Kristofferson Perlman Varela and Norman Reedus as a grungy weapons designer. Funniest exchange occurs when Blade asks if one of Damaskinos minions is human ""Barely"" the underling replies. ""Im a lawyer.""

Comments Blade II In this sequel to the 1998 thriller featuring the Marvel Comics character thats half vampire and half human the action moves to a dank netherworld where vicious uber-vampires are being bred in a plot to dominate the world. To wipe them out Blade (Wesley Snipes) works out a truce with his nemesis a vampire ruler who lends him a motley crew of soldiers. Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) returns too as a cynical father substitute for Blade--part of the films underdeveloped subtext involving untrustworthy authority figures. Scriptwriter David S. Goyer also plays with the notion of genetic engineering and with tired analogies to AIDS and coke addiction and he piles on the laughable dialogue. Director Guillermo del Toro (The Devils Backbone) tries to cover up using kinetic editing chiaroscuro cinematography and a spooky sound design but everything gets bogged down in one spectacularly gory action sequence after another. 108 min.

Tuesday March 26 2002 at 4 a.m. By Mark Holcomb Returning to pulp territory after The Devils Backbone Mexican director Guillermo del Toro cribs from his earlier work in an attempt to breathe life into Blade II a sequel to the 1998 Marvel Comics-inspired potboiler. The results rely more on Backbones gothic pulchritude and Mimics patent silliness than the whip-smart revisionism of Cronos and whereas that 1992 film slyly steered the vampire genre into new terrain the appallingly violent Blade II only wrestles it to the ground and sits on its head. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The titular vampire-hunting hybrid (Wesley Snipes who still delivers his lines like hes chewing a mouthful of Old Testament) is now living in Prague with a new sidekick and eventually the resurrected old one (Kris Kristofferson). The trio forms an uneasy alliance with an elite vampire militia to track down and exterminate a mutant strain of bloodsuckers called Reapers who are as conveniently adept at kung fu acrobatics as their more evolved brethren. The team infiltrates the undead subculture--which looks like a Pepsi commercial shot in an samp;m club--and confronts the mosquito-like creatures in their subterranean lair. There are several double crosses a few telegraphed plot twists and a dozen changes of fetish-wear before the final confrontation. Screenwriter David S. Goyers wan Omega Man-on-steroids premise inflates every well-worn trope of the genre and even drags in a few contemporary hot buttons mutating viruses drug addiction genetic engineering and (fleetingly) race hatred. But effective horror as del Toro seems to have grasped elsewhere tends to rely on the abasement of deeply held values not the antics of cardboard-cutout ghouls or vague headline-inspired jitters. The only thing Blade II values is its ability to deliver a staggering body count. Del Toros overripe style may fit the films comic-book milieu to a T but the only dread it inspires is in the possibility that its director prefers turning human flesh into CGI-enhanced mush over exploring genuinely frightening material. Hal Hartleys own take on monster movies No Such Thing is just as frustrating a cinematic renovation. Feeding on the same artist-parasite/beauty-beast dichotomies as Henry Fool but with none of its seedy warmth this dour solipsistic lark concerns an indestructible beast (Robert John Burke) with a raging death wish. Aided by sweet-natured journalist Beatrice (Sarah Polley) the monster dodges meddling government agents and a cynical TV news producer (an overreaching Helen Mirren) to achieve his suicidal goal. Too intensely focused on the travails of being Hal Hartley to function as pastiche No Such Thing is Hartleys least accessible screed yet. He tosses out ideas and obscure references (the monster-meets-kindly-newswoman setup is straight out of a Toho movie) like confetti with no apparent concern over whether or not theyll stick. Thematic muddle aside the films appeal lies in Burkes ranting charisma Julie Christies thankless turn as a sympathetic doctor and Michael Spillers radiant cinematography which frequently captures the mythic grandeur that eludes Hartleys narrative grasp.

By Paul ClintonCNN Reviewer (CNN) -- In 1998 Wesley Snipes walked the walk and talked the talk as Blade a half-man half-vampire walking arsenal of high-tech weapons. The character had one all-consuming mission to save the human race from blood-hungry vampires. (Apparently vampires are everywhere killing us silly humans left and right -- who knew?) ""Blade"" made more than 70 million at the box office and both Snipes and New Line Cinema smelled bloo ... er ... franchise. So it was only a matter of time until ""Blade II"" came along. (And get ready for ""Blade III"" likely coming soon to a theater near you.) Both ""Blade"" films feature vampires that are nothing like Anne Rices elegant sophisticated Lestat and company. These guys wear more leather than the attendees at a bikers convention. And while Rices vampires like to play head games with their victims the guys in the ""Blade"" movies love to play with their food -- literally. This film is not for the faint-of-heart.

Starring Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristofferson. Directed by Guillermo del Toro. (VHS and DVD. R. 106 minutes.) ""Blade II"" takes what might have been a continuing action series and leaves it for undead the victim of a script that probably doomed it and a director whose only contribution was to make things worse. Its a bad action movie because theres no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring. It didnt have to be that way. The first ""Blade"" which introduced Wesley Snipes as the sword-wielding vampire slayer was more than a style piece or a wallow in sensation. ""Blade"" may have been big outsize entertainment but it had a psychological sophistication and strangeness that marked it as more than junk. Audiences got inside the minds of Blade and his vampire prey and saw the world through their eyes. By contrast Guillermo del Toro director of ""Blade II"" stays strictly on the surface of the story from the filming of action to the casting of Leonor Varela as the love interest. Varela is beautiful but she is so lacking in confidence that she cant say two lines without looking as if she expects somebody to hit her over the head with a rolled-up newspaper. ""Blade II"" is all visual flourishes none of which is surprising or delightful. Watching it is like looking at a great big computer screen. The movie introduces a third element in the war between the vampires and humans Now theres a new kind of vampire out there so powerful it cant be stopped by silver and so hungry it needs to eat hourly and especially likes dining on . . . vampires. These super-vampires pose such a threat that the orthodox vampire community joins forces with Blade to rid the world of the new scourge. Action movies thrive on clear-cut heroes and villains and an audiences understanding that the struggle between good and evil has consequences. ""Blade II"" cuts itself from those conventional lifelines without finding any vivifying substitute. Who cares if the bad vampires triumph over the really bad vampires? With contempt for either the story or the audience -- or at least a perverse exuberance -- del Toro threw in every excess explosions shots of vampires dining on a spinal column and laughably gratuitous martial-arts sequences. He couldnt make things worse and then he did. . This film contains graphic violence.

Laura Miller Follow Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News Who could forget the fabulous vampire discotheque scene from Stephen Norringtons 1998 film ""Blade"" with its dance-floor crowd of downtown-chic bloodsuckers waving their pale yet shapely arms in the air and gyrating faster and faster to the soundtracks thudding beat until at the peak of their orgiastic frenzy the overhead sprinkler system opens up and douses them all in a shower of blood? Alas such extravagant days are over for the undead as well as the rest of us and while there is another vampire nightclub in the new sequel ""Blade II"" (directed by Guillermo del Toro) the club is really a kind of safe house. Its windows are blacked out the entrance is concealed and the habitues are forced to make do with simpler pleasures like French kissing with razor blades in their mouths. The fiends are lying low because theyre under a double-pronged assault from our hero the impassive saber-toting half-vampire Blade (Wesley Snipes whose mother was attacked by a vampire as she was giving birth to him) and from a new breed of super-vampires a rabid pack of skittering ultrapredators who prefer ordinary vampires to humans as prey. Times have changed but you can still count on a few things in this B-movie netherworld. The first is that if you are in a van trying desperately to escape from a pack of super-vampires crawling all over the vehicles exterior the engine simply will not start -- or certainly not on the first try. The second is that someone at some point will say ""Cmon kid Dont you even think about dying on me"" First off we should get the cosmology squared away. In ""Blade"" and ""Blade II"" (which are based on a Marvel comic created by Marv Wolfman) vampirism is caused by a virus that infects those bitten by a host. The infection brings on ""the Thirst"" and an acute vulnerability to silver garlic and sunlight along with superhuman agility relative imperviousness to conventional weapons and a wardrobe made entirely out of leather. (Vampirism is curable but only through a withdrawal-like process that few can endure.) Blade explains in the films opening voice-over that being a half-breed he has all the vampires strengths ""and none of their weaknesses"" which is why they call him Daywalker. If youre the kind of person who wonders how somebody can be only half-infected with a virus you wont have much time to dwell on such puzzles. After a brief and bloody prologue ""Blade II"" comes out of the gate at full speed with Blade charging down a corridor picking off vampires left and right with his silver bullet-loaded automatic weapons. (The vamps torch up from the inside and then turn to person-shaped cinders in a nice special effect.) This is the most video game-like sequence in a film that suffers from way too many fight scenes that last way too long and look way too computer-generated. Of course a movie like this does need a goodly portion of ass-kicking and no one does it better than Snipes but enough is enough. Why spend 9 on the same stuff you can get for a buck or so in that greasy little vidgame pit in the theater lobby? Blade rescues his old mentor Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) from a pack of vampires whove infected him and are keeping him hooked up to blood-dispensing IVs and suspended in a giant vial of serum. One appealing thing about horror movies is the way that their psychosexual undertones are so blatant that they can hardly be called ""under"" anything; this one is a Freudian playground. Del Toro (whose previous films include the giant cockroach thriller ""Mimic"" the village gothic ""The Devils Backbone"" and the arthouse curio ""Chronos"") works in the icky-bodily vein lingering over oozing fluids gaping wounds that expose weirdly pulsating organs and various nightmarish visions of pregnancy gestation and birth including in this particular case Kristofferson as an oversized gray-bearded pseudofetus in -- yes -- leather pants. You Might Also Like Despite Blades sworn enmity to their kind the Vampire Nation (not to be confused with Janet Jacksons Rhythm Nation but what with all those discotheques definitely under a groove) sends emissaries to his warehouse lair to engage in a protracted session of kickboxing and to ask for his help in destroying the super-vampire menace. This new breed of bloodsucker can make hash out of the standard model and the virus that creates them spreads particularly quickly. If you catch it you lose all your hair your flesh takes on the veiny coloration of gray quartz your eye sockets look like someones been grinding charcoal briquettes into them and instead of a leather outfit you have to wear a raggedy homespun-looking overcoat and muffler like a member of the chorus in ""Les Miserables."" Or maybe you have to dress that way just because youre from Prague where this movie inexplicably is set. Anyway no wonder these guys are pissed. Super-vamp anatomy is a psychoanalysts wet dream and the occasion for some of the best parts of ""Blade II"" at least for those who relish gruesome special effects. These beasties have a seam that runs down their chin and when one of them is closing in on its undead prey the whole lower half of its face splits open to reveal a Chinese puzzle of phallic/vulval organs that latch onto to the victims neck. Later on were treated to a dissection scene in a vampire lab where the super-vamps are discovered to have an enormous anus right about where their hearts should be. And what more honestly can be said about that? To battle these unsavory characters the Nosferatu-like vampire overlord Damaskinos (Thomas Kretschmann) hooks Blade up with naturally an elite yet rebellious ""tactical unit"" of vampire operatives called the Bloodpack (really). Led by Reinhardt (the inimitable Ron Perlman) they possess an exceptionally dopey collection of nicknames Chupa Priest Snowman Verlaine and Lighthammer (hes the hulking Wagnerian/heavy-metal guy). And so it goes Lots of jostling for alpha-male supremacy between Blade and Reinhardt; proud displays of gleaming weaponry (""Thats a pneumatic syringe delivery system""); tense stealthy expeditions into the citys sewers; fight scenes on elevated platforms; a smidgen of love interest with the vampire overlords daughter; set pieces of florid carnage; lines like ""Youre about one cunt hair away from hillbilly heaven"" and the predictable double cross. ""Blade II"" doesnt have quite as much of the wit that enlivened its predecessor though two wonderfully disgusting toss-away gags involve the vampire overlord snorting pink cocaine and eating blood Jell-O. A potentially promising scene involving a vat of blood falls flat because the liquid looks much more like Hawaiian Punch. Still ""Blade II"" does have Snipes whose Easter Island cool comes just shy of crossing the line into camp. His Blade is a man who cant head upstairs for bed without a little flourish of his floor-length leather trench coat. The only downside of watching him stand there glaring sternly at his opponent of the moment while his arms and sword windmill frenetically all over the place is that theres a little too much of it. That and the running up the walls and the flipping over and the flying through the air -- all symptoms of the craze for ""Matrix""-style martial arts that will only pass with time. Maybe by the time ""Blade III"" comes out the vampires will have reopened their disco in SoHo. Laura Miller is a senior writer for Salon.

"Gore Blunts Sharp Edge Of `Blade Ii - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Blade Gore Blunts Sharp Edge Of `Blade IiMovies - REVIEW - Blade IIThe Action Scenes Are Coherent And Exciting But Violence Makes Them Hard To Enjoy.March 22 2002|By Jay Boyar Sentinel Movie CriticBlade II has one obvious advantage over most exploitation flicks.Its action scenes are coherent. Unlike say the action scenes in the recent Resident Evil these allow you to actually follow what happens -- even when it happens very quickly.In fact these scenes are often exciting. Theres one early on in which Blade our vampire-hunting hero leaps into the air does a sort of back flip and comes down squarely on a motorcycle that is roaring along beneath him.Buffy for all her vampire-slaying skill never managed anything quite like that.A sequel to the 1998 original Blade II follows the further adventures of the Marvel Comics-inspired avenger a half-human half-vampire anomaly who hates vampires and injects himself with a special garlic serum to keep his own blood-sucking tendencies in check.This time Blade (Wesley Snipes) teams up with a gang of vampires called the Bloodpack to defeat the Reapers a race of super-vampires who suck the life out of humans and vampires alike. These Reapers have mouths that open so widely that their jaws temporarily split in two.Not a pretty sight.David S. Goyer who wrote the first Blade is back for the sequel which opens today. It takes a while for things to get going because Goyer must spend a lot of time resurrecting Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) Blades grizzled mentor who appeared to die in the first installment.Whistler is the Alfred-the-butler figure to Blades Batman. And Blade even has a Robin this time a pot-smoking slacker named Scud who actually refers to Blade by Batmans nickname ""the Dark Knight.""Theres even some wit here as in the scene in which Blade confronts a businesslike figure who works with the vampires. When Blade sizing him up says ""Youre human"" his reply is priceless.""Barely"" he says. ""Im a lawyer.""Snipes looks great in his leather get-up with its floor-sweeping overcoat. And he seems to be having a wonderful time playing superhero. He moves with such power and speed that the motion of his body tells you more about his character than anything he says.Crackly-voiced Kristofferson too seems to be having a grand old time. He snuggles down into the cranky character of Whistler as if it were his favorite old pair of shoes.Also in the cast are Norman Reedus as sidekick Scud Leonor Varela as Nyssa a sexy vampire who warms up to Blade and Ron Perlman as Reinhardt the merciless leader of the Bloodpack.This movies greatest strengths and weaknesses are in its action scenes.As mentioned theyre coherent and even exciting. You might even call them stylish. Director Guillermo Del Toro (The Devils Backbone Mimic) has a terrific eye for this sort of thing.But in the long run the exploitation elements completely take over. The blood and guts and gore and violence come to dominate the movie so thoroughly that finally the film cant be enough fun for anyone who isnt into dehumanization for its own grisly sake.Because Blade II has so much going for it thats a bloody shame.

In ""Blade II"" a second entertaining foray into the underworld of power-vampires hes the man with the plan the feet the weapons and the attitude. Its great to watch. In a world of bloodthirsty bruisers hes Mr. Slick. Thats because hes half-human half-vampire which gives him the best of both worlds. Ever since vampires attacked his mom (and infected the in-vitro Blade) hes been hell-bent on revenge. And thanks to his semi-humanity he can strut around in daylight without going poof In ""Blade II"" he learns that his beloved mentor fellow vampire-killer and weapons master Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) is still alive in Prague. (Whistler ""shot himself"" off-screen at the close of the last movie - that should have clued ya.) Whistler joins Blade and his new weapons specialist Scud (Norman Reedus) to tackle the latest world problem a plague of ""Reapers"" super-vampires who intend to destroy the worlds existing vampires and build a more powerful vampire. The Reapers have mandibles that can extend and superhuman power. They dont just drink blood from vampires they drain them dry then turn them into Reapers. The Vampire Nation technically Blades enemies appeal to Blade asking him to lead an elite team known as the Bloodpack to pulverize the Reapers. No problem. Of course the allegiance is only temporary. Blade has to watch his new teammates who were originally trained to kill him. They include Reinhardt (Ron Perlman) who takes special pride in his ability to beat any adversary and the mysterious attractive Nyssa (Leonor Varela). A little trash talking and a little love in the room never hurt anyone. To appreciate the movie you have to be okay with vampire violence. I dont mean subtle little nips at the neck and ooooh its directed by Werner Herzog. No I mean vamp-on-vamp smash-mouth ""Any Given Sunday""-meets-""The Matrix"" neck-puncturing. The Reapers dont bite or fight quiet. And the Bloodpack arent exactly sissies either. At the center of all this gymnastic gore-mongering is Blade pirouetting somersaulting high-kicking and twirling those killer blades with the real nasty edges. But its not just Snipess cool that propels this movie. Its the behind-the-camera combination of scriptwriter David S. Goyer (who wrote the 1998 film) and director Guillermo del Toro the Mexican maestro who made the atmospheric ""Cronos"" ""Mimic"" and ""The Devils Backbone."" Together they make ""Blade"" exactly what it ought to be fluid fast and fun. And its a cinch - given the care precision and almost-guaranteed success (in video rentals as much as theatrical box office) of this movie - that we havent seen the last of Blade yet. BLADE II (R 108 minutes) - Contains intense violence obscenity and neck abuse. Area theaters.

"Blade II A-Positive washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Movies Blade II A-Positive Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday March 22 2002 I like to think of the great humanist French film critic Andre Bazin. I like to think of his belief in the truth of cinema his conviction that through cinema could the world be healed. Then I like to think of him seeing ""Blade II."" I think it would go something like this ""AIEEEEEEEEEEEEE-AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"" There is no possible adult justification for the picture. It is pure pagan glee a raptors flesh fest a zesty paprika of cannibal stew stylized toward almost total abstraction beyond describing beyond imagining except by its makers. And that is why its so good. Enter here ye who dare. All others turn back. What ""Blade II"" has that so few others of its ilk or any ilk do is an actual director. He has a worldview. You may not agree with that worldview but its there all the same and it commands respect for the consistency with which he adheres to it and how its organizing principle permits his oeuvre to cohere. Heres his worldview ""Lets eat the weak."" No not exactly Christian or progressive but you cant have everything. Hes Guillermo del Toro who achieved his breakthrough in 1993 with ""Chronos"" and then went American less successfully with 1997s ""Mimic."" His last film was ""The Devils Backbone"" a brooding ghost story set during the Spanish Civil War. This time freed by a large budget a major star who gets it and uncountable gallons of fake blood hes created something ghastly yet wonderful at the same time. Derived from Marvel comic books the movie continues the tale of the half-man half-vampire Blade (Wesley Snipes) who has become the human champion in the war between the races. But in vampire movies as everywhere politics intrude; a third subspecies has mutated and it feasts on vampires themselves quite effectively. Thus a truce is established Blade helped by a vampire special-operations team that looks like a punk garage band that has just looted a National Guard armory heads out to take down this bad form of vampire. The setting is Eastern Europe the production standards high the violence kinetic and stylized the acting surprisingly good (with one drab exception); and the plot while nonsensical if you dont believe in vampires has a truly intriguing force and subtext. If youre going to make a movie about vampires fighting with automatic weapons in crowded Eastern European go-go joints this is the way to do it. Its also amazing how much an actor can contribute even to an overabundantly effects-driven piece like this. I speak yes of Snipes who is already so stylized he seems to have stepped from an Egyptian sarcophagus and then gotten a makeover from Aubrey Beardsley but also of Ron Perlman. Hes Blades primary antagonist on the ops team and what a great performance Really everyone in the movie looks like a Droog or a Druid yet Perlman manages to give his fellow an extreme individuality. That you even notice him among the sets and the slaughter and the too many guys in leather jackets with bald veiny heads and automatic shotguns is a miracle; that you like him (even though hes the bad guy) goes beyond the miraculous. The bald guys are fun too one being the master vampire Damaskinos (Thomas Kretschmann) and the other his mutant enemy Nomak (rocker Luke Goss). Alas the weak link is Leonor Varela who plays a vampire with complex family ties; while beautiful she never seems animated. Okay so shes dead. Still . . . Well anyway This movie is for a variety of segmented audiences children whose souls have been leeched by MTV folks with IQs under 100 and geniuses with IQs over 150. You normal people stay away You wont get it you wont like it and youll feel violated by it. BLADE II (R 115 minutes) - Contains extreme vampire violence. At area theaters.

"USATODAY.com - Blade II slices dices ultimately disappoints Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 03/21/2002 - Updated 0955 PM ET Blade II slices dices ultimately disappoints By Mike Clark USA TODAY Blade II (out of four) Stars Wesley Snipes Kris Kristofferson Leonor Varela Ron Perlman Director Guillermo Del Toro Distributor New Line Rating R for pervasive violence language some drug use and sexual content Opens Friday in the USA Credit Wesley Snipes for keeping his sunglasses on while pulling off Matrix-like moves throughout Blade II. Its the best such move since John Davidson kept every sprayed hair strand in place when the passenger jet flew upside down in The Concorde Airport 79. Because Snipes character is half-man/half-vampire as in 1998s Blade original he must need an ocular assist for his light sensitivity. So too must Ron Perlmans elite-guard vampire protector a pop-off villain whos also busy protecting his peepers. As a prelude to the Men in Black sequel this is ""Undeads in Shades."" Read more below Video View the Blade II trailer Early on theres a quick recap of the original the kind of pregame primer sportscasters give nightly during the NBA Finals. Novices will learn that Blades mother was attacked by vampires before his birth leaving him susceptible to their influence. And that mentor Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) lost his parents to vampires spurring his own vengeful agenda. Audiences left the first Blade thinking that Whistler had died but it turns out he was merely infected by a vampire virus. It must have craggy side effects because more than ever Kristofferson looks like he had mixed too much scotch and peppermint schnapps the night before. The heroes now must forge an alliance akin to the one in Fritz Langs 1931 classic M in which the police and underworld team up to nab a common enemy. The usual Blade-Whistler adversaries (standard vampires) need help in whipping a race of super suckers (Reapers) who arent even in the profession for erotic thrills. Its like when Richard Dreyfuss calls the devourer of Marthas Vineyard ""an eating machine"" in Jaws. These guys are that impersonal. This leads to one graphic open-mouthed interlude that showcases one Reapers sophisticated jaw tongue and glandular gunk -- a combo that threatens to create thousands of carriers within a month. We get this gruesome spectacle on a makeshift coroners slab and it makes the autopsy in The Silence of the Lambs seem like a country doc tapping your knee with a hammer. It wont likely spur a run on dental schools. Action-packed but ugly the movie hasnt a shred of dead or undead humanity aside from a few funny insults. The rest from director Guillermo Del Toro (Cronos Mimic) is desperate gouging kicking flying stabbing riding on an opponents back and other stuff Mike Tyson would probably try if he gets to fight Lennox Lewis. Snipes gives a looser cooler performance this time around though emotionally its closer to dead than undead. Blade II is for the horror faithful only; others will be grasping their crucifixes.

They used to wear tuxedos and capes and they spoke with such sexy Old World accents. When Dracula looked a woman in the eyes you knew he had something on his mind besides a hasty evening repast something the weak-kneed lass couldnt resist. And the vampires of old could turn into bats. How cool was that? Nowadays theyre just leather-clad bruisers who know kung fu. Blade II the sequel to the 1998 Wesley Snipes movie about a fanged half-human vampire hunter has so much martial arts youd almost think it came from Hong Kong. This time out Blade (Snipes) is living in Prague working out of a warehouse fortress with a young assistant Scud (Norman Reedus). At the end of the first Blade movie you will recall Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) Blades father-figure sidekick apparently commits suicide to keep from turning into a vampire. Now it turns out Whistler didnt die. He has been kept alive for two years by vampires and moved all over the world to keep Blade from finding him. This scenario and the inevitable rescue couldve made a movie all by itself. And since that film would have had an emotion-driven plot we might have cared about the proceedings. The filmmakers decided instead to get all this out of the way early. First Blade recaps his history in cheesy off-screen narration explaining how he is half-vampire and half-human and telling us how he met Whistler (though he doesnt explain how he can afford to travel all over the world and to have such high-tech gadgets). Then before you can say ""I vant to drink your blood"" three times Blade kicks vampire butt and he and Whistler are reunited. Presto Blade is adapted from a Marvel comic book so the pulpy bluntness of the filmmakers approach is appropriate but Snipes has talked of how he worked with screenwriter David Goyer to invest the first film with an element of ""King Lear-like"" tragedy. Goyer returns for Blade II which is directed by talented Mexican director Guillermo del Toro but this time the story forgoes feeling choosing instead to dwell on gore and present a compendium of late-20th-century horror and science-fantasy movie cliches. The vampires appeal to Blade for help. A new race of supervampires called reapers is threatening the vampire nation and soon will turn its attention to humans. Blade unites with the Blood Pack a nasty team of vampire assassins (initially formed to kill him) to hunt down the lead reaper. Every 20 minutes or so the story pauses so Blade and some foe or foes can swing swords and high-kick each other Matrix-style. When the reapers tire of kung fu they get down to bloodsucking business. But they dont just bite people in the neck. The lower portion of reapers faces open up and a tentacled leechlike appendage that looks like the creatures from Aliens comes out. It all is quite gruesome. But other than that the only thing to say is that these vampires sure are different from any weve seen before which surely is the point. Theres nothing wrong with reinventing vampires. The original Dracula movie deviated from Bram Stokers book making the vampire more debonair and less beastly. And Stokers vampire bore little resemblance to the Balkan vampire legends from which it grew. Vampires have been among the most enduring of monsters precisely because the myth is so adaptable to their times. Stokers 1897 novel was about transgressive sexuality and Victorian Englands fear of outsiders. Since the 1970s Anne Rice among others has portrayed vampires ambivalently showing them as brooding conflicted figures. Some people see the more recent portrayals of vampires as purely evil creatures as a reflection of more conservative times. What then do the vampires of Blade and Blade II tell us about our time? The original Blade portrayed young vampires as spoiled party animals rebelling against elders who made weighty decisions in corporate boardrooms. The medical metaphors treating vampirism as a virulent AIDS-like disease also were apparent. This time out the story seems oddly divorced from the recognizable world. There are references to drugs but mostly this film seems interested only in wowing us with stunts makeup special effects and plot twists that we see coming for miles. The leader of the Blood Pack is an attractive woman (Leonor Varela) the daughter of the head of the vampire nation. Oddly though while shes a babe he is as hideous as Nosferatu pale with a bald misshapen head and pointy ears. The reapers all look like this too. It isnt clear at first if Blade and Varelas character Nyssa really like each other or if theyre only pretending for tactical advantage. Its obvious from the beginning though that the other members of the Blood Pack want Blade and Whistler dead. Speaking of death one of the perplexing things about Blade II is how hard it is to kill anyone. Vampires of course are notoriously hard to kill. But vampire enemies who could give the superhuman Blade a run for his money beat the dickens out of Whistler and only scratch him up a bit. Apparently the filmmakers didnt want to have to go to the trouble of resurrecting the old coot for Blade III.

"Blade II Pumps New Blood Into Comic Book Series - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMovie Review Blade II Pumps New Blood Into Comic Book SeriesWesley Snipes returns as a more mature Daywalker taking on a super race of vampires in a sequel that tops the original.March 22 2002|KEVIN THOMAS | TIMES STAFF WRITER ""Blade II"" brings back Wesley Snipes in the title role as the Marvel Comics half-human half-vampire who wears a long flowing black coat and who has all the strengths of vampires but none of their weaknesses--save a craving for blood. However Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) who lost his own family to vampires is a scientific genius who took in Blade when he was a kid living on the streets and developed a serum to keep his thirst for blood in check. Cultivating a father-son relationship over the years Whistler and Blade have dedicated themselves to making war on vampires who they assure us ""are everywhere.""The first time out they took on Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) a cocky young vampire intent on world rule. Now in ""Blade II"" the current vampire overlord Damaskinos (Thomas Kretschmann) has asked his sworn enemy Blade to join forces with him to combat the Reapers a super race of vampires intent on destroying all vampires and then all humans. Silver bullets and garlic mean nothing to them.While it helps to have seen the original ""Blade"" for a full understanding of this so-called ""Daywalker"" (Snipes) and his character and the nature of his relationship with Whistler ""Blade II"" is more enjoyable than the original. Bloodbath that it is it is largely free of the extreme lingering sadism that characterized the first film and threatened to overwhelm Snipes iconic presence. Interestingly Blade has matured in the four years since we first met him on the screen. He has accepted the ultimately inescapable duality of his nature and the isolation that goes with it From the outset he accepts that the mutual attraction between him and Damaskinos beautiful daughter Nyssa (Leonor Varela) cannot go anywhere.With ""Blade II"" Guillermo del Toro takes over the directing chores from Stephen Norrington and this is frankly a plus. Del Toro the celebrated maker of ""Cronos"" and the recent ""The Devils Backbone"" brings to the films nonstop action a mastery of moods. This time the film is set in Prague and the ancient city and its buildings provide an invaluable portentous shadowy atmosphere.This is where Blade has relocated his elaborate laboratory and he has acquired a new scientific sidekick Scud (Norman Reedus) a brilliant but frequently obnoxious slacker dude who immediately clashes with Whistler once Blade has rescued him from the clutches of the vampires who had ostensibly killed him at the end of the first film. In going after the Reapers Blade and Whistler will have the services of the Bloodpack a crack unit of vampires. Not surprisingly relations between Blade and Bloodpack leader Reinhardt (Ron Perlman) are edgy at best.Like the original ""Blade II"" has superior production values and visual and special effects. Snipes and Kristofferson build on the resonance of their original portrayals. Snipes again combines a formidable physical presence with a depth of feeling and capacity for reflection unusual for an incarnation of a comic book hero. Hes larger than life though never lacking a human dimension. Not surprisingly the makers have left the doors open for yet another sequel.MPAA rating R for strong pervasive violence language some drug use and sexual content. Times guidelines not as grisly as the original but still fairly intense action.Blade IIWesley Snipes...BladeKris Kristofferson...WhistlerRon Perlman...ReinhardtLeonor Varela...NyssaA New Line Cinema presentation of an Amen Ra Films production in association with Imaginary Forces.

"`Blade II not as sharp as `Blade - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs `Blade II not as sharp as `BladeMarch 22 2002|By Robert K. Elder Tribune staff reporter.Over time comic book characters tend to sag under the weight of their soap operatic narratives.As Superman aged the cosmic Boy Scout was reinvented for each era so new readers didnt have to keep track of complex and conflicting story lines and an ever-changing cast of characters. Marvel Comics recently did the same with a Spider-Man reboot making Peter Parker a teenager again in ""Ultimate Spider-Man.""""Blade II"" starring Wesley Snipes as Marvel Comics mercenary half-breed vampire moves in the opposite direction alienating its potential audience -- new viewers or fans of the original ""Blade"" -- with its convoluted plot vapid supplementary characters and overwrought computer graphics.The first stake in ""Blade 2s"" heart is the return of Kris Kristofferson as Whistler Blades partner and weapons guru who killed himself after being bitten by vampires in the first film. Kristofferson is fine as the crusty mentor but too much time gets wasted on bringing him back into the fold and explaining his return. A cure for vampirism comes into play (the one discovered and discarded in ""Blade"") and then is tossed aside again further complicating Blades modus operandi. .The whiz-bang martial arts and exploding vampires in ""Blade"" were fresh visual eye-candy consumed by a pre-""Matrix"" public. A sequel under auteur fright-meister Guillermo Del Toro (""The Devils Backbone"" ""Cronos"") seemed like it might be promising.Instead Snipes continues to pose like a GQ cover model blowing kisses to his hot rod (literally) and killing foes when the lighting is juuust right. This time however he teams up with his sworn enemies -- the pervasive corporate culture of vampires -- to bring down the Reapers a new strain of crackhead bloodsuckers feeding on vampires and humans alike.He gets a crew of special ops vampires to lead -- the Blood Pack (actors Ron Perlman Leonor Varela and others) an elite unit originally trained to kill him. An arsenal of shiny new anti-vamp toys are also laid at his feet. In other words special effects get heavy play in ""Blade 2"" especially computer graphics (CG).Digital graphics are most effective when they blend into the films production design and narrative. As someone once said of cosmetics ""The trick is not to look like youre wearing makeup."" And ""Blade 2"" is the Tammy Faye Bakker of action movies.Del Toro repeats the same mistake made in the comic book movie ""Spawn"" by trying to pass off clumsy CG characters as fully articulate humans. Several sequences including Blades introductory tussle with love interest Nyssa (Varela) look like scenes out of high-end video games but resemble nothing committed to celluloid. Plus characters get laugh-inducing regal lines like ""The true power of the vampire nation lies here"" and ""You have been our most feared enemy."" Vampires are unnatural beings but not this unnatural.When Blade isnt a badly lit CG mannequin Snipes brings his undead superhero to snarling life with as much realism as can be expected. Instead of more kung fu however he steals moves straight out of ""WWF Smackdown"" from the German suplex to the elbow drop. And Snipes doesnt stop there He quotes ""The Godfather"" and walks in slow motion a la ""Reservoir Dogs."" Against the rest of his dramatically flimsy crew Snipes sunglasses-at-midnight strut conveys an almost lifelike sheen. Almost.Hes more alive than the movie which is dead on arrival.""Blade II""(star)1/2Directed by Guillermo del Toro; written by David Goyer; produced by Michael De Luca Wesley Snipes and Peter Frankfurt; photographed by Gabriel Beristain; edited by Peter Amundson; production design by Carol Spier. A New Line Cinema release; opens Friday. Running time 148. Rated ""R"" by the MPAA for strong sci-fi/horror violence and language.Blade .................... Wesley SnipesWhistler .................

"Blade II | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; blade-ii ) Blade II (United States 2002) A movie review by James Berardinelli Those regarding Blade II as a travelogue will not be planning their next vacation to Prague where the bulk of the motion picture takes place. (Economic considerations caused it to be filmed there.) The Eastern European city is portrayed as a shadowy hellhole thats crawling with vampires. Like the recent Queen of the Damned Blade II postulates that todays society is in part populated by the creatures of the night. Theyre everywhere. In fact the ratio of the undead to the living in Prague appears to be ridiculously high. As the Roman numeral indicates Blade II is the sequel to the 1998 would-be first-in-a-franchise outing Blade. The film stays true to its unpretentious origins - its like a comic book come to life with an undeniable visual flair a lot of kinetic action sequences minimal character development and a plot that could charitably be called ""uneven"". In actuality significant chunks of the movie dont make a lot of sense but logic was plainly not a top priority on the filmmakers agenda. Blade II takes place two years after the original Blade and opens with the title character half-vampire/half-human vampire killer Blade (Wesley Snipes) looking for his partner Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) who is in the clutches of the dastardly undead. Supposedly Whistler died in the first movie but the lack of a body gave writer David S. Goyer some wiggle room. In the time since Whistlers capture Blade has gained a new assistant Scud (Norman Reedus) whos just along for the ride. Shortly after rescuing Whistler Blade receives two visitors - Nyssa (Leonor Varela) and Asad (Dannny John Jules) envoys from the vampire king Damaskinos (Thomas Kretschmann) who is seeking a temporary alliance. It seems that a new breed of rogue vampires called the Reapers is terrorizing both the human and vampire communities. While these ghoulish creatures are allergic to light they are not affected by silver bullets or garlic and they possess an appetite that makes the traditional vampires seem anorexic by comparison. Damaskinos would like Blade to take command of a unique squad of crack vampire warriors - the Bloodpack - and lead them against the Reapers and their first-born Nomak (Luke Goss). Thus is born an unholy alliance. Blade II is essentially a series of stylish violent battles between Blade and his various enemies. The flavor of the conflicts is heavily influenced by the martial arts genre but its a more in-your-face less elegant form of combat than the one offered by Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Director Guillermo Del Toro (whose previous south-of-the-border vampire tale Cronos put him on the international map) steeps everything in darkness and gothic imagery. Blade II may be seriously lacking in the substance arena but its never boring. Those in search of a film that offers wall-to-wall samplings of gory kick-ass action will find it here. Those looking for something creepy or frightening are encouraged to look elsewhere. And thinking is not welcome - you can check your brain at the theater door. Why for example do the members of the Bloodpack fail to use the UV flashlights on their guns to kill the Reapers (who dissolve in a puff of CGI dust when exposed to such illumination) and instead persist in firing away at them with conventional bullets? Not because it makes sense but because it extends the decibel range and the running length. As Blade Wesley Snipes radiates even more attitude than he did in the previous outing. This man is cooler than cool has more gadgets than James Bond and Batman combined and could outduel Jackie Chan and Jet Li with one hand tied behind his back. Unlike Superman hes not allergic to Kryptonite and a quick bath in blood will revive him more fully than a nights sleep and a back rub. Snipes is perfect for the role and knows how to play the character without taking things too seriously or turning the production into an overly campy affair. Meanwhile Kris Kristofferson has the thankless job of portraying Blades sidekick which means he spends most of the film in Snipes shadow. Relative unknown Leonor Varela is sultry and sexy in a leather-outfitted bamp;d sort of way. And reliable Ron Perlman (who previously appeared in Del Toros Cronos and spent a lot of time hunting nasty creatures in dark places in Alien Resurrection) plays Reinhardt the captain of the Bloodpack. Like Aliens (and the numerous films that inspired it) Blade II is about an antagonistic group of grunts (the vampire Dirty Dozen) thrown into dark enclosed spaces to fight an enemy against which they are undermanned. Plus theres a double-cross involved (the reason for which when it is revealed makes no more sense than the rest of the film). Blade II is for those undiscriminating movie-goers who want nothing more from a trip to the multiplex than loud raucous mindless entertainment.

Goyer; Producer (person) Avi Arad; Release Date Wide 03/22/2002; Runtime (in minutes) 120; MPAA Rating R; Distributor New Line Cinema Posted March 20 2002 -- 1200 AM EST There are two ways to kill people in Blade II. You can be elaborately technical in your combat which is how Blade (Wesley Snipes) - half human half vampire and all sulky - tends to go about it; at various points he wields a samurai sword phosphorous bombs and his own acrobatic kicking-off-the-walls body. (In a nice touch the camera sometimes twirls right along with him.) Or you can be elaborately slurpy in your flesh-eating which is the mode preferred by the villains. Theyre a crew of deluxe vampires who look like Nosferatu with skin made entirely of blue cheese. These supersuckers have mouths that split open into...much bigger mouths the cavities adorned with a gelatinous thrusting thingy that unfurls like calamari with genitals. (Hey I just report this stuff.) Directed by Guillermo del Toro ""Blade II"" is less obsessed with its hero as a fashion statement of new-millennium demon chic than the first ""Blade"" was. The new film seems equally influenced by videogames and open-heart surgery. Del Toro lays on the operatic head-trip gore but his heavy-handed embrace of the ""Blade"" mythology allows Wesley Snipes to give more of a performance than he did in the first film. He taps a note of stylized pathos in his portrayal of a hero caught between worlds. Could it be that Snipes a good actor who became an action star got caught between worlds himself?
