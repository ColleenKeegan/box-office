Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Somewhere amid an ocean of self-help dating tomes like the ubiquitous ""Hes Just Not That Into You"" and ""Men Are From Mars Women Are From Venus"" the battle of the sexes rages on. Women think with their hearts men think with their -- well you know. And thats the gist of the latest edition in the rom-com canon the surprisingly snarky and smart ""The Ugly Truth."" Abby (Katherine Heigl) is a control-freak TV producer in Sacramento and because shes a professional woman she wears her hair pulled back tightly (see Sandra Bullock in ""The Proposal"") and she never ever goes on dates. Or if she does theyre blind ones set up by her assistant producer who helpfully prints out a profile background check and even a set of talking points. She lives alone with her cat and therefore shes hopelessly lonely waiting for the perfect man. Enter Mike (Scot Gerard Butler as an American playboy) the complete opposite of everything Abbys so carefully plotted on her ""dream man checklist."" Hes crass hes misogynistic and hes just been hired to shake things up on Abbys floundering daytime variety show. Mike immediately discovers that his new boss is hot but a total dork who also needs serious help in the bedroom. Abby detests everything Mike stands for but agrees to let him help her out to snag that perfect man swoony Dr. Colin who inspires some very dorky Elaine-from-""Seinfeld"" sort of dancing on Abbys part. Slowly Abby learns that perhaps her Prince Charming isnt that checklist but the rogue right in front of her -- can the control-freak woman tame the wild man and vice versa? Ah but thats the debate of the ages. Despite the fact that it swims in a veritable ocean of romantic comedy cliches (girl pretends to be someone shes not to catch a man ladies man realizes he has a heart the clash of the uptight and the laid-back etc.) ""The Ugly Truth"" should manage to captivate and charm men and women alike. The dialogue is snappy and sexy Heigl and Butler spar with zingy chemistry and though the ending is as predictable as youd assume its a sexy sort of popcorn flick. This is a romantic comedy for the Cosmopolitan set. A gag on par with Meg Ryans fake-orgasm tutorial in ""When Harry Met Sally"" may win Heigl the crown as the new queen of the chick flick and she deserves it -- shes gonna go there and go there she definitely does with panache to spare. Where other rom-com vets such as Ryan tended to veer toward the cuddly and adorable Heigl plays her heroines with a flinty prettiness an intelligent-girl spine and a sassy mouth. She has a future in these sorts of movies and that seems to suit her just fine; you dont see her reaching for the title of serious actress and that makes her likable. THE UGLY TRUTH  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for sexual content and language. Butler of course is in fine form as a lady-shagging devil with a soft spot or two and the supporting cast particularly Cheryl Hines and John Michael Higgins as the bickering newscasters increases the laugh factor. But dont bring Grandma to ""The Ugly Truth"" because its a sex comedy through and through as upfront and honest as advice from your wise-ass best friend. And thats whats so charming about it; neither writers nor actors nor director Robert Luketic shy away from the truth about the complicated state of affairs between men and women.

(Columbia Pictures) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday July 23 2009 359 PM Title The Ugly Truth Ugly is indeed the word for any comedy that manages to insult both its cast and audience with nearly every scene. Proudly coarse and painfully contrived Robert Luketics desperate date-night flick doesnt even give us anyone to root for. Theres certainly no telling why Katherine Heigl would agree to dim her natural confidence to play a character as pathetically insecure as Sacramento TV producer Abby Richter. Brittle and uptight Abby is completely appalled when  her boss hires boorish Mike (Gerard Butler) to boost the ratings of their morning news show. You cant fault her A warrior in the battle of the sexes Mike revels in his caveman status. After he has offended every woman within range (including a wasted Cheryl Hines) and brought Jell-O-wrestling twins into his first broadcast Abby wants to fire him. But they make a deal If he can help her snag a cute doctor named Colin (ultrabland Eric Winter) Mike gets to stay. The only catch is that she has to do exactly as he says.As a result Abby learns to flirt manipulate keep her opinions to herself and embrace the wonders of the pushup bra. Naturally Colin responds and -- youll never guess -- Mike does too. It would help at least a little if there was a single spark of chemistry between the equally distracted stars. But how could there be? Theyre too busy grappling with the sort of crass aggressively adolescent dialogue that ought to render any screenwriter permanently unemployable. Luketic is also to blame given that every element from the cinematography to the sets feels as fake as the script. Theres not even enough cheesy fun in these dreary proceedings to call ""The Ugly Truth"" a guilty pleasure -- all the guilt in fact lies with the filmmakers whove created a movie without a moment of truth to be found.

Gerard Butler and Katherine Heigl star in The Ugly Truth. Photo COLUMBIA PICTURES/SONY The Ugly Truth 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Gerard Butler doesnt actually grunt spit and scratch his bitsies in The Ugly Truth but he might as well. Playing a sexist he-man of the old order -- Macho Sapiens Neanderthalensis a type unseen since Burt Reynolds heyday -- Butler puts on the growl-y line readings and smirking charisma of a man with no patience for the foolishness of dames. What Women Want matters nothing to this guy. What he wants is plain skinny bod perky breasts and two hot babes in a vat of Jell-O. As Mike a bawdy morning commentator for a Sacramento television station he crawls in with them to demonstrate live on-camera the masculine aversion to candlelit dinners. This is presented as an either/or proposition gelatinous bimbos over here serenading violin over there. Not exactly subtle is it? Then again The Ugly Truth doesnt waste much time on subtlety mining its biggest laughs -- and there are several -- from rude crude verbal combat and a pair of vibrating panties. Astute film goers will note similarities to previous tales of love and woe including in no particular order Hes Just Not That Into You Cyrano de Bergerac When Harry Met Sally and The Taming of the Shrew. Directed by Robert Luketic (21) and penned by The House Bunny screenwriters Kirsten Smith and Karen McCullah Lutz (along with newcomer Nicole Eastman) The Ugly Truth is about as predictable as youd expect. Meaning plenty. Mikes producer is Abby (Katherine Heigl) a proud and beautiful control freak who cant land a man to save her life. Mike mocks Abby. Abby loathes Mike. But when some convoluted slapstick causes Abby to drop from a tree beside the naked loin of a hunky neighbor (Eric Winter) Mike offers to coach her through the dating process until the hunk is snared. If the ploy works she has to lay off hating on Mike. If it doesnt hell quit the show. Soon the game is on and Mike floods her with advice. Rule One Never criticize your man. Rule Two Always laugh at his jokes. Rule Three Dress for success (select the right bra). Rule Four Never ever talk about your problems. He offers several more directives most of them too fixated on primary and secondary sex characteristics to repeat here. Butler barks them out gamely in a somewhat tortured faux-American accent and Heigl responds with fine-tuned klutziness and outrage the Spartan warrior of 300 and the embattled Izzie of Greys Anatomy throw off some genuine heat. Despite the R-rated raunch The Ugly Truth has all the tidiness and bounce of Luketics usual PG-13 output (Legally Blonde Win a Date With Tad Hamilton). Of course in the real world a pig like Mike would never make it on morning television; hes too much to stomach over a bowl of Cheerios. And speaking of the real world Id like to speak in defense of the average man a much-maligned creature in romantic comedy these days. ""Men are simple"" Mike says at the start. And while he gets more risibly complicated as the plot unfolds the ugly truth about The Ugly Truth is the fact that -- funny though it is -- it could have been a whole lot funnier. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals PUMA at eBay for Deals from 2 + free shipping 10x30-Foot Gazebo Tent Canopy for 75 + free shipping Sinwood Indoor Electric UV Insect Zapper for 29 + free shipping Original Penguin Mens Leather Wallet for 15 + free shipping Powered by Contests Enter to win concert tickets airfare and hotel More Entertainment News Rolling Stones Lash Out at Donald Trump (Again) Over Song Use Daveed Diggs Renee Elise Goldsberry to Leave Hamilton Broken Social Scene Working on New Album Steve Young of M/A/R/R/S Pump Up the Volume Fame Dead Calvin Harris Taylor Swift Song Co-Write Questions We Still...

Romantic comedies are an increasingly debased genre but few recent Hollywood products have been anywhere near as crass and contrived as ""The Ugly Truth."" This is the sort of comedy that requires you not only to suspend disbelief but your sanity as well. PHOTOS Makeover Movies PHOTOS 50 Romantic Comedy Couples We Love For starters you have to accept that a control-freak TV producer would accept romantic advice from a sexist shock jock whom she loathes.

It doesnt help that the producer is played by Katherine Heigl (""Knocked Up"") in a manner so over-the-top that her character resembles no actual human being Ive ever met. Or that her macho love-hate interest -- with whom she has exactly zero on-screen chemistry -- is lazily portrayed by Gerard Butler (""300"") who spends much of the movie struggling to disguise his Scottish brogue under one of Mel Gibsons old American accents. Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith -- who wrote the vastly funnier ""Legally Blonde"" for director Robert Luketic -- along with credited co-writer Nicole Eastman seem to have drawn their uh inspiration from ""Someone Like You"" (2001). In that forgotten and hardly original comedy Ashley Judd is the TV producer who turns to womanizing co-worker (Hugh Jackman) for romantic counsel. I could be wrong but both movies climax with the heroine improbably being allowed to seize control of the airwaves -- though in fairness ""The Ugly Truth"" sets this scene in a hot-air balloon amid special effects that wouldnt pass muster on Saturday-morning television. But credibility isnt a consideration in a movie in which everyone behaves in an arbitrary manner. Butlers salty tirades against women wouldnt be allowed by the FCC even in these more permissive days. And when he turns dating-coach for Heigl -- who claims she hasnt had sex in 11 months because her stridency scares men away -- his advice runs to eating a hot dog really slowly in front of her latest victim. Butlers ostensible romantic rival is a hunky orthopedic surgeon blandly played by Eric Winter who accidentally drops his towel when she falls out of a tree into his arms. Not that anything actually happens in ""The Ugly Truth"" which is all blue talk and absolutely no action. For all the discussion of oral sex masturbation and faking orgasms as well as a level of F-bombs more usually heard in films by Martin Scorsese Heigl doesnt even take off her bra when she goes to bed. Considering shes one of the producers Heigl allows herself (and the film) to be photographed in a shockingly poor manner. She does relentlessly hog the camera allowing very little screen time to the far more comically competent John Michael Higgins and Cheryl Hines as a husband-and-wife anchor team. The comic high point of ""The Ugly Truth"" involves a pair of vibrating panties that Heigl unbelievably dons before a business meeting. They are remotely controlled by a prepubescent boy as Heigl delivers a very poor imitation of Meg Ryan in ""When Harry Met Sally."" Some in the audience with me howled at this. Other ashen-faced survivors leaving the sub-Farrellyesque romp looked like they agreed with Heigls character who at one point says ""I feel dirty."" lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next CRONKITE EULOGIZED AS NEWSMAN FRIEND FATHER Read Next CRONKITE EULOGIZED AS NEWSMAN FRIEND FATHER Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 44527 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 21107 16 feared dead in Texas hot air balloon crash 17704 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post The ""Ugly Truth"" stars Katherine Heigl as one of those highly capable-incapable women that movies love to sell us. You know the type As a morning news producer Abby Richter stares down the chaos caused by anchor egos gone batty and logistical snafus. But as a single gal shes dim when she isnt coming off as desperate. We all know ""Sex and the Citys"" Carrie Bradshaw -- and lady youre no Carrie Bradshaw. (Although Gerard Butlers Mike Chadway does resembles the ""Sex"" character Samantha once his new and infuriating TV personality starts asking whether Abby ""flicks her bean."") The movies title refers to Chadways shock-cocky cable-access show. Abbys ratings are in the basement naturally. So hes hired. The calls come in. Women love him. Guys learn from him. Or so the film insists. ""The Ugly Truth"" hasnt an honest bone in its body. Rating share goes through the roof. Abbys scale is rattled by her new Cro-Magnon commentator and not in a good way. Screenwriters Nicole Eastman Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith make sure that we dont share her sense of gall letting us in on a secret early on. Psst Mikes a bit of a fake. Hes got a nephew whom he adores and a sister who has his number. With the ease of a network sitcom (but not the tight one-liners) ""The Ugly Truth"" leaps over hurdles in a hurry. Cheryl Hines and John Michael Higgins are wasted as co-anchors married to and chilly toward each other. A few words about manhood from Mike and voila (Of course the demand to ""Let me be a man"" sounds more like a bleat.) Abby winds up taking advice from Mike about Colin a neighbor who on paper (and yes she has a checklist) is close to perfect. Earlier in the year the better but far from perfect ""Hes Just Not That Into you"" also had a cad who clues a woman in on the simplicity of men. But Colin is that into Abby. Only is it the real Abby or the woman with the hidden earpiece taking cues from Mike? Besides his six-pack abs and a rather divine mouth theres not a lot to the good-looking doc. It isnt fair to fault Eric Winter for his bland daytime-soap handsomeness. Colins flawlessness is part of the point. But in a movie that telegraphs its outcome hes a straw man of a romantic rival. Directed in a seeming rush by Robert Luketic ""The Ugly Truth"" is rated R. With its blue language it appears calculated to compete in the marketplace with ""bromances"" and Judd Apatow Inc. comedies. It comes by its rating almost entirely by sexual innuendo some f-bombs and a scene at a restauratnt that evokes the one between Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal in ""When Harry Met Sally."" What that movie had that this doesnt chemistry. Butler and Heigl are lookers which doesnt guarantee magic (phew mere mortals sigh). With his stubble and an onscreen comfort zone as wide as a gridiron the Scotsman is especially appealing. Meanwhile she evokes a young finer-boned Ellen Burstyn. If only she proved as gritty or gifted. Heigl along with her mother Nancy executive-produced this comedy. Kudos to actresses taking the reins of their careers. But dont undersell audiences. With its set em up knock em down series of cliches ""The Ugly Truth"" marks off the romantic comedy checklist. But theres a lesson offered by the movie that it doesnt heed Just because it gets the boxes checked doesnt mean itll rock your world. ""THE UGLY TRUTH.""

(SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Jason AndersonSPECIAL TO THE STARFri. July 24 2009(out of 4)Starring Katherine Heigl Gerard Butler John Michael Higgins. Directed by Robert Luketic. 95 minutes. At major theatres. 14AOpposites attract but youll really wish they hadnt by the time The Ugly Truth is through. Knocked Ups Katherine Heigl and Scottish beefcake Gerard Butler should make for an appealing pairing but this romantic comedy is too inane and incoherent to pass muster even as a piece of late-summer fluff. Largely exuding the same joyless air she does whenever shes on the outs with her bosses on Greys Anatomy Heigl plays Abby the producer of a low-rated Sacramento TV morning show hosted by a husband-and-wife team (played by an underused John Michael Higgins and Cheryl Hines). As we see when she goes on a brief date Abby drives away any romantic prospects with her control-freak tendencies. That dooms her to being alone at least according to Mike (Butler) the loudmouth Neanderthal who berates her when she calls into his late-night cable show. In his snarky rants about men and women Mike combines the laid-back charm of Mad Money host Jim Cramer with the emotional sensitivity of comedian-turned-author Steve Harvey. ""All this men-are-from-Venus crap is a waste of time and money"" he declares in a braying tone. Article Continued BelowAbby is appalled when this ""uber-moron misogynist"" gets a regular spot on her show. Though its hard to see how much longer he can milk this schtick when his thoughts on romance could fit on a napkin and still leave room for phone numbers his antics win ratings.These reluctant co-workers declare a truce when a hunky surgeon (Eric Winter) moves into Abbys apartment complex and she solicits Mikes advice on how to land him. Imagine what follows as George Bernard Shaws Pygmalion except with a potty-mouthed Henry Higgins instructing Eliza Doolittle on how to dress more like a stripper. Indeed theres plenty of raunchy talk in The Ugly Truth along with one lengthy comedic setpiece involving a pair of vibrating panties and a misplaced remote control. While the adult content elicits most of the movies laughs its often a poor fit with the characters adolescent behaviour. The films own take on sexual politics is so primitive that Mike seems almost wise. But the real ugly truth about The Ugly Truth is how starkly it illustrates the decline for Hollywood comedies about battles between the sexes not just in the 62 years since Cary Grant and Irene Dunne had at it in The Awful Truth but also in the 14 months since the release of Sex and the City The Movie. Given the state of the rom-com its easy to understand the recent success of The Proposal - which boasts genuine chemistry between its leads some decent physical comedy and a semblance of a plot none of which can be found here.

Aint that The Ugly Truth Updated  | Review  | Recommend E-mail | Print | Enlarge By Saeed Adyani Columbia Pictures Its a familiar dance as opposites Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler discover they are meant for each other. ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Ugly Truth  Stars Gerard Butler Katherine Heigl Cheryl Hines John Michael HigginsDirector Robert LuketicDistributor Columbia PicturesRating R for sexual content and languageRunning time 1 hour 36 minutesOpens Friday nationwide  WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Despite its appealing stars The Ugly Truth is a charmless romantic comedy. The film is so predictable that it might as well have been written as a test classroom exercise in RomCom 101. The notion that opposites attract is a staple of the genre. But that doesnt mean the well-worn concept couldnt have been approached from a fresh angle. Theres nothing new or remotely inventive about this battle-of-the-sexes romp. The most notable aspects are its coarser-than-usual language and the flashes of chemistry between Gerard Butler and Katherine Heigl. Heigl plays Abby the ultra-capable producer of a morning news show. Though she prides herself on finding solutions to any problem her competence does not extend to relationships. A control freak her businesslike approach to dating hasnt panned out. Butler is Mike a brash TV ""shock broadcaster."" Abbys morning show hosted by a vapid married couple (Cheryl Hines and John Michael Higgins) is plagued by plummeting ratings so her boss brings in Mike hoping his ""Ugly Truth"" segments will juice things up. Abby is instantly repelled by the boorish Mike and he finds her cute but uptight. Things go from predictable to contrived as Abby takes dating advice from Mike. Along the way we learn hes not as one-dimensional and sexist as he seems and shes more playful than expected. Their banter is occasionally fun thanks to Heigl and Butlers lively delivery. But their best scene together is a wordless one on the dance floor. Butler clearly has the looks and personality for a romantic comedy leading role. Heigl widely known for her role as Izzie in TVs Greys Anatomy plays a part that is not so different from her characters in Knocked Up or 27 Dresses. Higgins and Hines are given little to do but react to Mikes antics. The Ugly Truth offers decent performances by attractive actors hampered by a bland script. If youre looking for a witty original romance see (500) Days of Summer. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Reader Editor Brent Jones.

The book purportedly a series of intense conversations between Arlen and the Almighty (no mention of the royalty split) became the last word in spiritual uplift for seekers around the globe and begat countless brand extension titles like ""Me and God for Teens"" ""Me and God for Atheists"" and ""The Me and God Diet."" Were talking a bedazzling 10% of the God market. So boasts Fabers literary agent (Nora Dunn) in the bland comedy-drama ""The Answer Man."" ENLARGE Jeff Daniels stars in The Answer Man also featuring Lauren Graham. Magnolia Pictures Apparently fame and fortune werent the answer to Arlens prayers. A curmudgeon (but not really not underneath it all) he rattles miserably around his Philadelphia townhouse. Too bad; the city of brotherly love here is bathed in the same rosy glow that burnishes Manhattan in a Woody Allen movie. The cascade of packages and fan mail delivered to Arlen each day goes mostly unopened; the doorbell goes mostly unanswered; pleas to appear on ""Oprah"" ignored. The worshipful UPS man and a needy just-out-of-rehab bookstore owner (Lou Taylor Pucci) would get a friendlier reception from a rabid dog. Arlens bad attitude is matched only by his bad back. The cure for the former is complicated; the cure for the latter is Elizabeth (Lauren Graham) a chiropractor and anxiety-riven single mother who conveniently has just opened an office in the neighborhood. She can straighten Arlen up but can she straighten him out? And what of Elizabeth herself whos lost and foundering? As the movie makes clear the road to enlightenment like the road to romance demands patience fortitude and a GPS. Mr. Daniels and the appealing Ms. Graham are perfectly fun to watch; ""The Answer Man"" which owes a tidy debt to ""As Good as It Gets"" rather less so. Its crackly sarcasm and smart talk turn out to be simply coating for a soft icky center. In keeping with the conventions of contemporary romantic comedies director-screenwriter John Hindman burdens his stars with a collection of quirks that will do nothing to define character or push along the plot. (Arlen is obsessed with a collection of action figures; Elizabeth with the restraints on her sons car seat). Mr. Hindman also relies on such shopworn tropes as a strictly-by-the-book character being shown the light by a free-thinker--who of course has all the answers. In the Loop Simon Foster (Tom Hollander) a blunderbuss of a British government minister veers dangerously off course during a television interview in the first moments of ""In the Loop"" a cynical look at geopolitics and its practitioners. The war on diarrhea in the third world a topic about which Simon can wax logorrheic suddenly becomes a discussion exploring the possibility of a U.S. war in the Middle East a topic about which Simon knows less than nothing. ""Unforeseeable"" he burbles gamely to the sulfurous rage of the prime ministers asp-tongued communication director Malcolm Tucker (Peter Capaldi). Simons subsequent clarification to eager reporters works just exactly like gasoline on a bonfire. ""To walk the road of peace"" he says ""people have to be prepared to climb the mountain of conflict."" A poor choice of words is what starts all the trouble in ""In the Loop"" an outgrowth of the BBC series ""The Thick of It"" with Mr. Capaldi reprising his television role. Its words ill-chosen ill-advised misconstrued and misinterpreted its words stretched twisted and changed in the name of expediency that must claim responsibility for the ensuing chaos in the corridors of power on both sides of the Atlantic. ENLARGE James Gandolfini is a general in In the Loop. IFC Films/Everett Collection And its the hilarious tumble of words--the sly cultural references astonishingly creative invective the veritable arias of profanity--that gives the film an unexpected heft. Words yes and a subplot that involves a collapsing garden wall a hapless government minister--you take it from there. Otherwise ""In the Loop"" is a confusingly plotted satire--plan on being out of the loop--that starts off at such a frantic pace and at so high a pitch that it really doesnt have anywhere to go. And its filled with characters--your choices are dim scheming or hyperventilating--whose presence grows wearying. One exception James Gandolfini in a terrific turn as a U.S. general. Salute him before he heads off to war. The Ugly Truth Audiences never seem to weary of watching opposites attract and an ever-growing number of them pay not the slightest mind to reviews. Lucky for Hollywood. Otherwise romantic comedies like say ""The Ugly Truth"" a particularly coarse sniggering representative of the breed would be flat out of luck. Abby (a less than compelling Katherine Heigl) is the Sacramento-based producer of a morning TV show whose ratings are in the tank. Abby we are meant to understand is earnest (she wants more serious hard-hitting features on the program). And Abby as we quickly observe is clueless (she wants more serious hard-hitting features on the program). Her personal life is no better than her audience share She brandishes sheets of talking points at her hapless blind dates. In a Hail Mary play the station manager hires Mike Chadway (Gerard Butler) the crude scruffy star of a late-night public-access cable show who has attracted attention for his straight-from-the-crotch observations about men and women. ENLARGE Gerard Butler and Katherine Heigl deal with The Ugly Truth. Columbia Pictures Abby is horrified by this new addition to the show; macho Mike is everything she hates in a guy. The segments she produces with him scantily clothed women cavorting in a pool of strawberry (or is it cherry?) Jell-O--are everything she hates in TV. But her revulsion becomes grudging respect then something more when Mike successfully coaches her through the pursuit of the cute orthopedist next door. ""The Ugly Truth"" wants to have it both ways reveling in a misogyny it claims to deplore. A scene in a restaurant that features vibrating underpants and a 10-year-old boy inadvertently working the remote-control device (dont ask) is particularly offensive. Perhaps none of this would matter or wouldnt matter as much if the movie had even a moment of freshness or wit one honest laugh. It doesnt--and thats the ugly truth. DVD Focus As Good as It Gets (1997) ENLARGE Jack Nicholson is a misanthropic novelist with obsessive-compulsive disorder who gets reluctantly involved in the lives of a gay neighbor (Greg Kinnear) and a beleaguered waitress (Helen Hunt) in James L. Brookss sharply observed comedy ""As Good as It Gets."" (Oscars went to both Mr. Nicholson and Ms. Hunt.) Its hard to swallow the ill-fitting conventional happy ending but if the movie pulls some punches Mr. Nicholson never does. Hes in clover as his character Melvin Udall gleefully tosses off racist homophobic and sexist insults. How does he write women so well a fan wants to know. ""I think of a man"" he replies with poisonous good cheer ""and I take away reason and accountability."" Wag the Dog (1997) ENLARGE The president of the United States is caught alone with a Girl Scout a few weeks before Election Day in Barry Levinsons deft satire ""Wag the Dog."" The spinmeister (Robert De Niro) whos recruited to do damage control decides to stage a war with Albania as a way of diverting attention from the scandal. Reluctant to start shooting without a script he hires a Hollywood producer (Dustin Hoffman) to give it the old razzle dazzle. After all whats a war without a theme song? So just how credulous is the electorate? How pliable are the media? Guess. Pillow Talk (1959) ENLARGE In the classic comedy ""Pillow Talk"" interior decorator Jan Morrow (Doris Day) is forced to share a party line with Brad Allen (Rock Hudson) a song-writing Lothario who keeps the phone tied up day and night wooing his myriad girlfriends and leaving Jan no opportunity to make calls of her own. Dial A for Animosity. Then Brad gets a load of Jan at a nightclub and decides to add her to his trophy case. Thelma Ritter is indispensable as a dipsomaniac housekeeper who gets her thrills listening in. -- Joanne Kaufman Find television listings at LocateTV.

Liam Lacey From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Thursday Jul. 23 2009 214PM EDT Last updated Friday Jul. 24 2009 316AM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The Ugly Truth Directed by Robert Luketic Written by Nicole Eastman Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith Starring Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler Classification 14A If Doris Day and Rock Hudson had made jokes about vibrating panties and fellatio at the ballpark just think how much funnier their romantic comedies would have been. That appears to have been the brainwave behind The Ugly Truth  the latest Katherine Heigl comedy from the director and two-thirds of the writing team of Legally Blonde . Contrived as a crossover between a female-friendly romantic comedy and a male-targeted anti-political correctness jab The Ugly Truth veers between crude and cloying. Heigl ( Knocked Up  27 Dresses ) stars in her third comedy in a similar role as an overachiever careerist with no time for romance in her life. Here she plays Abby Richter a television producer at a Sacramento Calif. morning show. To boost the shows ratings her boss hires a sexist local-cable host Mike Chadaway (Gerard Butler). Hes a former salesman who argues that men want lust not love and women should learn to accommodate them. On his first day he solves the marital woes of the shows bickering co-anchors Larry (a very funny John Michael Higgins) and Georgia (Cheryl Hines) by encouraging Larry to assert his inner caveman. Abby despite a few years in the news business is infuriated by this or at least for two or three scenes until she makes a deal with Mike Shell take his advice on how to land her waxworks-handsome doctor neighbour Colin (Eric Winter). If his advice fails he agrees to quit the show. This is the setup for a progressively more improbable series of gags that sees Mike guiding Abby through dates via an earpiece like a modern-day Cyrano de Bergerac while she endures various humiliations before she recognizes which man she really wants. The script for The Ugly Truth was written by three women Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith ( Legally Blonde  The House Bunny ) and Nicole Eastman. They try desperately to copy Judd Apatows recipe for romantic raunch but succeed only in reversing his snigger-to-flinch ratio. Certainly the script is not helped by director Robert Lukatic who directs this like an episode of Two and a Half Men  right down to the nudge-nudge musical cues and flat visual style. Heigl is obviously not at ease with the physical slapstick the role demands; she puts far too much effort and calculation into her characters every reaction. In spite of the cameras rapt attention to Heigls blondness full lips and tight clothes her performance never really feels like anything more than a series of wardrobe changes and disconnected outbursts. The best one can say for the performances here is that you cant possibly imagine stars Heigl and Butler are as obnoxious as the characters they play. Thats particularly true of Butler whose shambling puppyish manner belies his characters hostile edge. Long before Mike shows his true romantic colours his soft side is a foregone conclusion. The minimum you ask of a romantic comedy is that it leaves you with a mildly pleasant sense that deserving pretty people can find true love. Yet right down to the final scene with its grating soundtrack and cheap computer-generated imagery The Ugly Truth feels more ugly than true and predictable in everything except its level of crassness.

Heigl a large pretty actress of farm-girl robustness and pale orange skin and hair tones had emerged from the cast of Greys Anatomy to serve as Seth Rogens femme foil in the surprise hit Knocked Up then scored on her own as the perpetual bridesmaid in 27 Dresses. More than Reese Witherspoon and Kate Hudson her prime rivals among early-30s contenders for the Roberts ring Heigl radiated a pensive solidity that if properly exploited could have spurred the return of a warmer less dizzy brand of romantic comedy. (See TIMEs review of Heigl in Knocked Up.) I speak in the past tense since Heigl comes near to emptying her reserves of goodwill with a disastrous new concoction called The Ugly Truth. In its wan attempt to be raunchy the picture fails where Judd Apatow has usually succeeded; written by three women this is a girls mistaken idea of an R-rated comedy. Heigl as star and executive producer doesnt do herself any favors either. She spends virtually the entire movie getting mocked up and knocked out. (See TIMEs review of (500) Days of Summer.) Here as in her two earlier starring roles Heigl is an efficient professional who has no luck finding men. Her Abby is the producer of a Sacramento TV news show whose ratings skyrocket when the on-air team is joined by Mike (Gerard Butler) the host of a late-night cable program called The Ugly Truth. Mike is a macho man with a Cro-Magnon spin on sex telling his female listeners ""We fall in love with your tits and your ass. And we stick around for what youre gonna do with them."" Desperate to get a man -- any man but Mike -- she takes his advice on landing the hunky surgeon (Eric Winter) whos moved in across the way. Mike will play a burly Cyrano to the doctors winsome Roxane until Abby realizes that Mr. Wrong is right for her. The screenwriters -- Nicole Eastman Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith -- had one sharp idea to explore the polar-opposite rules of guy comedies and gal comedies. Guy comedy revels in the blithe display of unruly behavior; a Rogen or Jason Segel character doesnt do or say crude things for shocks sake but as an expression of his unhousebroken personality. Its not what he does; its what he is. Gal comedy plays on these same embarrassing words or situations to test the heroines decorum and destroy her dignity. In both kinds of movies the activities and attitudes that men are proud or unaware of are exactly the ones that women try desperately to suppress. The dichotomy is both reductive and profound the male brutes let-it-all-hang-out vs. the civilized females try-to-pretend-it-didnt-happen. (See an audio slideshow of Sandra Bullocks film roles.) So The Ugly Truths plot is a series of humiliations for Abby. At a restaurant meeting with network clients she happens to be wearing a pair of sexually vibrating panties that Mike gave her and in a gloss on Meg Ryans fake orgasm in When Harry Met Sally... she writhes way too long in ecstasy and mortification. At a ball game with the doctor she follows Mikes advice and fellates a hot dog then is seen on the scoreboard Kiss-Cam bending over and I cant even type what happens its so demeaning and annoying. Yet Abby deserves all this public grief because at heart shes a pill and a pain. Beneath her cheery demeanor is the iron will of a control freak who is bossy both to her staff and to the men she might get it on with; for one blind date she prepared a series of mutual talking points. Were led to understand that her need to dominate comes from a lack of erotic pleasure in her life. What the movie doesnt address is the root problem of Abbys character. Its not that shes this way because she hasnt gone to bed with a guy. Its that no guy would go to bed with her because shes this way. (See TIMEs movie covers.) Mike meanwhile for all his rough edges is not a predator or a bully but for his and the movies perspective a truth teller. More important hes comfortable in his own skin like the Rogen and Segel guys. The Ugly Truth thus establishes its agenda as a rehab process for Abby not a comeuppance for Mike. What a romantic comedy should be doing is showing whats attractive and limiting in two people then bringing these plausible opposites together at the middle. Something is very wrong when the beast is instantly more appealing than the beauty and when a comedy becomes an essay in misogyny. (Read more about quirky love stories.) The director Robert Luketic who did the very agreeable Legally Blonde (written by two of this movies screenwriters) falls down big time here. He gets no connection let alone chemistry between the two leads and he botches that obligatory romantic-comedy trope the falling-in-love-on-the-dance-floor scene. (The films one decent moment an elevator kiss.) And as long as hes doing an R-rated comedy shouldnt he observe one off the genres cardinal rules and have someone go topless? If not Heigl then Butler whose magnificently bulked-up chest was one of the attractions of 300. Im not saying that The Ugly Truth is a career ender for Heigl. Indeed as the first romantic comedy in wide release since Sandra Bullocks The Proposal five weeks ago the movie will attract its share of dating couples and single women. But if youre looking for a rom-com with a higher IQ and an almost obsessive aim to charm its audience youd do better with (500) Days of Summer which should soon get to a theater near you than this (500) ways of abasing Katherine Heigl.

Starring Katherine Heigl Gerard Butler Cheryl Hines Director Robert Luketic Running time 136  Editorial Review A Rom-Com So Ugly Its DelightfulRuth McCannWashington Post Staff WriterJuly 24 2009""The Ugly Truth"" takes everything that is romantic comedy to the manic max. This Mars-Venus skirmish set in a TV newsroom is a self-conscious glut of creamy skin magazine-ready homes misogyny man-hatred predictable romance and incessant banter. Its rom-com writ large -- so blown up that its faintly ridiculous and what with the knowing irony and all somehow new again. And how delightful it is.At a floundering Sacramento TV station Abby (Katherine Heigl) is a workaholic producer who cant seem to keep her Nielsen ratings or her dating life steady. She lives alone in a well-appointed condo with only her tabby dArtagnan to lend a sympathetic ear. Abby is halfheartedly hoping to land The Perfect Man with a symmetrical face and you know morals. But shes way too Type A to rope anyone (Caveat lector Suspend serious amounts of disbelief here as Heigl is a godlike creature).But whats this? Egad Abbys TV station desperate for viewers starts airing a relationship-advice spot hosted by the rakish unshaven Mike (Gerard Butler). Hes a modern-day libertine a connoisseur of coarser pleasures a dispenser of hard-hitting un-PC ""truths."" Viewers eat him up.You know the story Mike uses naughty words on air; Abby hates Mike; Mike doesnt believe in love; Abby doesnt believe in lust; Abby wants to date some upstanding doctor; Mike helps Abby date upstanding doctor; vibrating lingerie is purchased. The whole makeover fantasy is indulged -- Mike sex-kitten-ifies Abby gives her the lowdown on how to snag a man (keep him waiting and never take control -- duh) and coaches her through a first date Cyrano-style via a hidden earpiece. Unlikely friendship and -- surprise -- something more ensue.Credit where credit is due ""The Ugly Truth"" might be the first film in which a womans yanking out of her hair extensions signals a true emotional climax. And its just this sort of off-kilter quality that makes this script more impressive than its fluffier cousins. One senses a gleefully dark sensibility lurking in the minds of the films three female screenwriters who have no qualms about dialogue that might be tooquicktokeepupwith. Where run-of-the-mill rom-coms dodge pessimism and prurience and body-fluid jokes ""The Ugly Truth"" excels poking indiscreetly into the genres every corner with more clear-eyed force than say ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" would ever dare.Under the direction of Robert Luketic (""Legally Blonde"") ""The Ugly Truth"" is indulgently glossy refreshingly snarky and legitimately sexy. Its no art film (obvi) no soulful indie flick and no ""When Harry Met Sally . . . "" for that matter. But when Mike advises Abby to be ""the saint and the sinner the librarian and the stripper"" how can the hardened rom-com-hating Thinking Woman not bark a gruff and hearty ""Ha""? The film is shallow and fleeting candylike and summery. But there is no shame in that. And if you refuse to see it now youll see it on some airplane someday. And youll watch it. And thats the ugly truth.Contains sexual content and language.

The advertising for ""The Ugly Truth"" will undoubtedly mention that its from the same team that gave you ""Legally Blonde."" What it probably wont mention is that its also from the same people who brought you such classics as ""Monster-in-Law"" and ""The House Bunny."" The Ugly Truth (R) Columbia (95 min.) Directed by Robert Luketic. With Katherine Heigl Gerard Butler. Now playing in New Jersey. Stephen Whittys rating Two Stars Ratings note The film contains sexual situations graphic language and brief nudity. And thats the real ugly truth. Another slick but by-the-numbers romantic comedy ""The Ugly Truth"" offers the old chestnut about opposites attracting. Shes a sleek sophisticated journalist; hes a shot-and-a-beer kind of mans-man commentator and although they absolutely hate each other at first sight before too long . Do I really have to go through it? Cant we all just rewatch ""Woman of the Year"" instead? Well no not really because Tracy and Hepburn didnt do vibrator jokes. Nor did they make movies that thought it was the height of wit to have people talking graphically about genitalia show women wrestling in Jell-O or cut to ""nature footage"" of copulating monkeys. ""The Ugly Truth"" boasts all that. And less. I like an occasional dirty joke but the operative word there is ""joke""; the reason ""The Hangover"" was such a success wasnt because it was raunchy. Its because it was funny. It had actual setups situations and punch lines. ""The Ugly Truth"" has Katherine Heigl cursing and Gerard Butler scratching himself. It also has a plot -- he coaches her in what men really like so she can find a boyfriend but he ends up falling for her along the way -- that feels like something Id seen before. Then I realized I had. It was called ""Hes Just Not That Into You."" ""The Ugly Truth"" is easy to be not that into too. Dont fault the apple-cheeked Heigl whom the camera loves (and who does an adorably geeky dance). Butler is suitably rugged and even charming in a grizzled Cro-Magnon kind of way. (As a Scot hes also proof of my growing conviction that America now needs to import its legitimately macho movie stars; his competition for Heigls heart is buffed and beautiful and looks like he stepped out of a shampoo ad in Glamour.) No the real problem here isnt the stars but the script. It makes Butler spout lunky ""commentaries"" that wouldnt have passed muster on ""The Man Show."" It thinks just having Heigl say dirty words is somehow funny. Its best gag is -- well the nicest term is ""borrowed."" Want a good date movie? Go see ""(500) Days of Summer."" Want a great raunchy comedy? Wait for ""Funny People"" coming out next week. Want a smart woman-centric comedy? Wait for ""Julie and Julia"" coming out next month. The ""Truth"" hurts.

After so many screen waifs and wraiths its invigorating to see the womanly Katherine Heigl and the manly Gerard Butler together on screen.Still I have to ask Why did these most convivial of actors the very definition of va-va-voom and hubba-hubba commit themselves to a throwback battle-of-the-sexes comedy that wasnt so funny in the 1950s and is even less so now?Not to put too fine a point on it though the actors flaunt their formidable biology they dont exhibit much chemistry in this one about the career woman and the caveman who falls for her while giving her dating advice.The Ugly Truth is Heigls third feature film in a row as a career woman whose personal life is a casualty of her professional ambition. She plays Abby Richter A1/4ber-efficient producer of a morning show in Sacramento where she conducts full background checks on the shows guests and her own blind dates. No fewer than three times does a fellow character describe Abby whose hair is as tightly wound as her personality as a ""control freak.""No surprise then that the station manager hires a superfreak to shake things up. That would be Mike Chadway (Butler) host of the cable-access program The Awful Truth where he purveys tough-love sex advice to women.""If you want a relationship get on a StairMaster"" exhorts Mike. Men may know everything about lust and manipulation he says but they are incapable of growth or progress. He counsels his listeners that getting hitched isnt on the to-do list of most men because all marriage is about is social pressure and status.To the surprise of no one who has been force-fed the opposites-attract plotline since infancy Abby and Mike are mutually intrigued. But Abby hides it because she needs to prove to Mike that the surgeon next door is an evolved male who wants more from a woman than the full Lewinsky. And Mike hides it because he has bet Abby his job that if she follows his advice the surgeon will be smitten.Mikes counsel is pretty much the sort given by Justin Long in Hes Just Not That Into You only blunter. In essence Dress like a slut think like a man and play hard-to-get.Director Robert Luketic (Legally Blonde) directs with the subtlety of a mallet. Screenwriters Nicole Eastman and the Blonde team of Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith provide dialogue that has the propriety of the locker room.The obligatory scene where the control freak loses control is indicative of the movies how-low-can-you-go bid for laughs.It involves a pair of vibrator-embedded panties inadvertently worn to a business dinner. As I watched Heigl womanfully clowning her way through this sequence I sank in my seat in a defensive crouch.Heres hoping that Heigls next movie script unlike the last three will not involve her characters humiliation by (future) boyfriend and bosses. Heres hoping that Butler who has a sure comic touch can find better material than this and P.S. I Love You.And heres hoping that this unfunny comedy doesnt set both sexes back by 50 years.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Email| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Like most women in movies right now Katherine Heigl was born in the wrong decade. She has the misfortune to work in a time when her business values women either as something else for the camera to do (apparently Megan Fox is all the transformer certain men need) or as a device to confuse gaydars. Sixty years ago she might have been a biggish deal in minor comedies the way she is now. But she might also have had taller more charismatic men to star with and better things to be and represent than she does at the start of the 21st century where shes stuck playing professionally capable socially retarded women.Heigl plies her trade in so-called chick flicks the Lean Cuisine of romantic comedy and her latest contribution ""The Ugly Truth - or as I fondly came to think of it the Baja-style chicken quesadilla (only five Weight Watchers points) - casts her as an undersexed television news producer named Abby Richter. This is a promotion from being an aspiring TV personality (""Knocked Up) and a smitten eco-magazine drone (""27 Dresses).Why is Abby undersexed? Not simply because shes overworked (she loves her job) but because shes so good at what she does that she does it during dates. For one rendezvous with Kevin Connolly of ""Entourage she arrives armed with a background check talking points and a checklist of desired personality traits likes red wine and classical music has a symmetrical face never gets up first on a Sunday morning (whatever that means).This is not a woman. This is a walking Facebook profile.Thank goodness her Sacramento morning show has just brought in Mike Chadway (Gerard Butler) a barking chauvinist to lift the ratings and consequently educate Abby on how to conduct herself with the boringly handsome surgeon neighbor (Eric Winter) shes just started seeing. She produces Mikes segments. He produces her dates. Even though theres no reason for Abby with her principles and integrity to like this (admittedly appealing) lout little time is wasted foreshadowing the love Jacuzzi that awaits them.The people responsible for ""The Ugly Truth - director Robert Luketic and screenwriters Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith sharing a credit with Nicole Eastman - were also responsible for ""Legally Blonde. That must have been a once-in-a-lifetime thing since this new movie is only half as entertaining as the other one. Abby is not a terribly surprising or dynamic character. Shes a cliche. In ""Legally Blonde Elle Woodss dumbness was a neat rubber toy - pull on it and it snaps. Abbys intelligence is like stale Play-Doh. No ones building a Broadway musical around that. Her sense of fun is doused with professionalism. In name only ""The Ugly Truth echoes Leo McCareys exuberantly well-oiled 1937 screwball comedy ""The Awful Truth with Irene Dunne and Cary Grant as a divorcing couple who are still in love despite themselves. (Although Eric Winter is as perfect a hapless stooge as Ralph Bellamy in McCareys movie.)Otherwise ""The Ugly Truth draws from a different well. Many women in romantic comedies in the last few years have been modeled on either Liz Lemon from NBCs ""30 Rock Sally Albright from ""When Harry Met Sally or Jane Craig in ""Broadcast News three of the most important female TV or movie comedy characters in the last two-and-a-half decades.Abby has a combination of their professional seriousness and their high-strung temperament. But those women are funny true and humanly neurotic. The screenwriters picked over their obvious traits (Lizs unlimited capacity for humiliation Sallys finicky ways Janes prickly righteousness) without attaching anything emotional to them. Its hard to see any of those women climbing a tree to fetch a cat only to fall out of it and into a mans crotch. Abby does that.The movie has embarrassingly limited ideas about both the sexes and sex. Like Sandra Bullocks career woman in ""The Proposal Abby appears to have never heard of intercourse much less experienced it.""The Ugly Truth does stand admirably by its R rating. All the best dialogue is unprintable (so is most of the worst) and a pair of vibrating panties affords Abby the opportunity to loosen up in a manner that would put a smile on Sally Albrights face.Heigl and Butler make more sense together than most of their peers. He has creases in his face and a swashbuckling unapologetic manliness that suits romantic comedies since theyre about taming wild impulses. Its fun watching the genres corset squeeze in on him.And yet its unfair that Heigl is laced up from the start. Her most believable moments come when shes in complete control over her seductive powers. That happens twice and on both occasions the joke is that shes faking it. American movies continue to damn the control freak for not being a super freak and the super freak for having no control. Ill marry the filmmaker who gives us a complete woman who splits the difference.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation.

Share Tweet Women are from Heart men are from Penis in The Ugly Truth one of those romantic comedies that vows to cut through all the usual relationship bullshit while serving it up in heaping spoonfuls. Though tarted up with the R-rated vulgarity of a genre thats usually PG-13 the film grafts setpieces from popular favorites like When Harry Met Sally... (the orgasm scene) and Roxanne (the balcony scene) onto an opposites-attract scenario about an uptight control freak looking for love and an alpha-male cretin who represents everything she hates about men. Will these two bickering ninnies turn their friction into romantic sparks? Or will she wind up with the abs-sculpting white-wine-sipping metrosexual orthopedist of her dreams? With teeth gleaming like a sun-dappled spring Katherine Heigl stars as the high-strung producer on a low-rated morning news show in Sacramento. Desperate to please their new corporate masters the station hires mans man Gerard Butler for a segment called ""The Ugly Truth"" in which he dishes out bracingly misogynist relationship advice. Heigl doesnt initially appreciate Butlers brazenness but she eventually turns to him for pointers on how to land the handsome doctor (Eric Winter) who just moved into her building. (Cue a typically labored sequence where Butler feeds her advice via earphone at a baseball game.) But as Butler gets Heigl to loosen up and she knocks the chip off his shoulder... well to quote the studio executive in Barton Fink ""Whaddya need a roadmap?"" Making good on the raunch factor The Ugly Truth will likely be remembered for an agonizing setpiece in which Heigl wears remote-controlled vibrating panties to a fancy company dinner. Never mind that the filmmakers are hoping audiences will forget about Meg Ryan; just the logistics of the thing (Heigl slipping them on just before her boss unexpectedly shows up to whisk her to dinner the remote being mistaken for a compact the dumb kid at the restaurant picking it up after it rolls out of her purse et al.) require so much exertion that no payoff is worth it. Heigl and Butler have real chemistry together--Butler in particular can be charming when he isnt stalking Hilary Swank from beyond the grave--but The Ugly Truth is the sort of rom-com apparatus that no relationship can overcome.

Photo Credit AP Photo/Columbia advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT An uptight television producer clashes with her crass new star. BOTTOM LINE Poorly written and exceptionally crude though Heigls natural charm shines through. CAST Katherine Heigl Gerard Butler Eric Winter LENGTH 132 A romantic comedy written by three women and directed by a man ""The Ugly Truth"" does a disservice to both genders. Its crass sex jokes feel like chum for mentally stunted males while its dimwitted storyline seems aimed at females who find paperback romances overly nuanced. Its doubtful these demographics even exist outside the filmmakers cynical imaginations. But they are represented in ""The Ugly Truth"" by Abby Richter (Katherine Heigl) the high-minded producer of a Sacramento television program and Mike Chadway (Gerard Butler) a cable-channel commentator who believes women are good for only one thing. Were meant to believe these two will throw sparks but instead they produce the acrid smoke of a grease fire. advertisement | advertise on newsday The dull plot involves Abbys desire for Colin (Eric Winter) her bland but hunky neighbor. Socially inept and insecure Abby allows Mike to shape her into an attractive ditz which sends Colin head over heels. Meanwhile Mike mopes in the background. But wait Is Mike a sex-crazed Howard Stern or a sensitive Phil Donahue? The screenwriters - including two who wrote ""The House Bunny"" - cant decide which leaves Butler adrift. And director Robert Luketic efficient enough with ""Legally Blonde"" isnt much help dutifully shooting each contradictory scene. As a result the films central romance flips and flops like a dying fish. Only Heigl who seems game for anything manages to overcome the crude material. At one point the movie puts her in a pair of vibrating panties then switches them on during a business dinner. To Heigls credit its the funniest scene in the film.

The Ugly Truth Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2009) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-ugly-truth-2009,200,theuglytruth23,theuglytruth,rogerebert
"Ugly Truth The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; ugly-truth-the ) Ugly Truth The (United States 2009) July 22 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Hollywood it seems has lost the knack of how to make a good romantic comedy. The best two such films of 2009 Adventureland and (500) Days of Summer have come down the indie trail. The major studios are unwilling to fund any production that doesnt adhere to a rom-com formula that is becoming tired more as a result of misuse than overuse. These movies still sell a fantasy but it has become more a case of putting together two attractive individuals and telling the audience theyre falling in love than taking the time to develop interesting characters and build the romance. The Ugly Truth is a perfect example of the former approach. The only thing that differentiates it from far too many other uninspired rom-coms is that some of the material is funny and there is an occasional edge to the repartee. Beyond that however its a cookie-cutter movie and the cookies are pretty stale. A couple of years ago the pairing of Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler in a mainstream romantic comedy would have been deemed ""daring."" Since then however King Leonidas and Izzie Stevens have been bulking up their credibility in the genre with Butler appearing opposite Hilary Swank in P.S. I Love You and Heigl headlining Knocked Up and 27 Dresses. With those titles under their belts theyre as safe choices as Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey. Theyre both photogenic and if Butlers American accent slips from time-to-time who really cares? Their chemistry is hit-and-miss but I cant help wonder if this is more symptomatic of problems with the direction of Robert Luketic (Legally Blonde) and the weaknesses in the screenplay. When theyre given a full scene in which to interact theres something there but those moments are few and far between. Since this is a romantic comedy and they are the leads its a given they will fall in love so why bother showing it? Abby Richter (Heigl) is the uptight anal retentive producer for a Sacremento morning TV show thats on the verge of being canceled due to poor ratings. Desperate for anything that will get viewers interested the station manager (Nick Searcy) hires Mike Chadway (Butler) the crass un-PC host of the cable access ""advice show"" The Ugly Truth. Abby thinks Mike is full of B.S. and makes her opinion clear but hes an immediate sensation. Meanwhile shes obsessing about how to capture the attention of her hunky new neighbor Colin (Eric Winter). Mike proposes a deal hell offer his insights into the male psyche and teach her how to catch Colin if shell agree to work with him. If he fails in helping Abby to hook her ""perfect man"" hell quit. She agrees and the courtship begins. Of course it quickly becomes clear that Abby is really attracted to Mike and Mike is re-thinking his lust-over-love philosophy as a result of Abby. You dont need to see the movie to know how it ends. One thing The Ugly Truth has going for it is that unlike many romantic comedies this one is actually funny - not consistently but there are enough laughter-inducing scenes to keep things from becoming too tedious. Much of the humor is of the sex farce variety with some of it (like a sequence involving vibrating underwear) falling into the Benny Hill school of funny bone tickling. For the most part The Ugly Truth is PG-13 material (with the only nudity being a male butt) but some profanity and a few descriptive sex terms push it over the line into the realm of the soft R which makes no sense from a marketing standpoint. (But thats another story.) The Ugly Truth feels like it started as a tame romantic comedy before someone decided to graft a few Sex and the City elements onto it. The Ugly Truth is as review-proof in its own way as any teen-oriented summer blockbuster. Its a neatly packaged product that comes with all the consumer friendly safety labels. The comedy as sophomoric as it often is relieves some of the boredom of the generic love story which might have been more interesting if it had followed up on the bits of The Taming of the Shrew Pygmalion and Cyrano De Bergerac that it toys with. Admittedly mentioning those three titles makes The Ugly Truth sound more interesting than it is because theyre ultimately little more than window dressing. The movie is more like a re-make than something new but many viewers find comfort in the familiar and this is for them. For my part if I want to re-visit this formula Ill head for the DVD shelf where better interpretations of the same basic story exist.

Today anyone eager for tips on how to find and woo the perfect mate hardly needs to look to Hollywood. Amorous instruction is everywhere -- on reality shows; in hipper-than-thou mens and womens magazines; in music videos and stand-up comedy; in ruthless-as-you-gotta-be advice bibles like The Rules (guys are dogs who must be tamed) and The Game (girls are princesses who must be knocked down); in that big pink Sex and the City boxed set; in the endless massed shelves of chick lit... Given all that its hardly a surprise to see a romantic comedy in which the two main characters arent so much human beings as walking talking extremes of he said/she said psychobabble. In The Ugly Truth Mike Chadway (Gerard Butler) a ranting Neanderthal philosopher-lout rises out of the swamp of public-access TV to land a segment titled ""The Ugly Truth"" on a local news show in Sacramento. Mikes idea of how to make a relationship work sounds like the braying of Andrew Dice Clay spiced with the hormonal sensitivity of Joe (Girls Gone Wild) Francis. He thinks that men want women to look hot and act hotter and that women who think theyre meant to do anything more are delusional. When Mike on his new TV gig leaps into a vat of Jell-O with a pair of wrestling bimbos its not because he doesnt believe in ?romance -- its because he thinks thats all romance is. Mikes producer Abby Richter (Katherine Heigl) finds Mike and his stripper-pole view of the world abhorrent (as well she should). That of course is because shes ?his opposite number a control-freak prude who treats her prospective boyfriends as job applicants. Shes also obsessed with ""class"" (you know bistros and galleries). As Mike and Abby bicker and claw they sound like dueling magazines When Maxim Met Cosmo. But then assuming that youve spun past the implausible notion that a local news station would ever hire a horndog firecracker like Mike (or that the viewers would give ?him a 93 percent positive rating) a second contrivance kicks in He tries to win Abby over by coaching her on tactics to nail her ?latest prospect (eat hot dogs suggestively) even giving her a makeover (more jiggle shorter skirts). At around this point the movie turns into When Clueless Met Porkys. Seriously can you feel the love? The Ugly Truth was directed by Robert Luketic (Legally Blonde) from a script by Nicole Eastman and the team of Kirsten Smith and Karen McCullah Lutz the duo who wrote Legally Blonde and The House Bunny. Perhaps because its less stylized than those films The Ugly Truth isnt fizzy and fun -- its vacuously snappy. Butler the gruffly bearded Scottish-born hunk hasnt done much since leading the Spartans in the semi-digitized war epic 300 (2007); this is the first chance anyone who didnt catch RocknRolla or P.S. I Love You has had to see what hes like in an ""ordinary"" role. To judge from The Ugly Truth Id say hes a potato-faced Russell Crowe with a lot less charm. Butler has a jovial twinkle but because hes working so hard to nail an American accent he doesnt so much enunciate his words as masticate them. He tears into every scene as if he were devouring a 20-ounce steak. Heigl who has mastered the art of acting insecure in order to make her porcelain-?doll sexiness seem more offhand has energy problems of her own. Shes not just nervous shes skittish; she cant relax for long enough to let the audience fall for her. She and Butler certainly generate sexual chemistry Theyre both so tightly wired and attractive in such outsize opposite ways (When Gladiator Met Barbie? Okay Ill stop) that when they kiss on an elevator they look as if they can hardly wait to go to bed. But does that mean theyre right for each other? Or just ripe for an ? empty hot fling? Mike thinks that a ""refined"" woman like Abby needs a caveman to shake her up. He also thinks thats a finger in the eye of conventional wisdom. The ugly truth is that its the ultimate chick-flick cliche. C+ See all of this weeks reviews Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

The Ugly Truth Director Robert Luketic. Cast Katherine Heigl Gerard Butler Eric Winter. Rating Rated R for sexual content and language. Related Chick flicks So goes the mantra of Mike the Cro-Magnon like host of a cable-access show played by Gerard Butler in ""The Ugly Truth."" An ironic role for a guy who got famous for being ripped and running around causing mayhem in ""300"" but can now put this effort beside ""P.S. I Love You"" on the list of lame romantic comedies hes starred in. Then again its a role that allows him to wrestle beautiful women in bikinis in vats of Jell-O so maybe thats something. If Mike goes with his gut claiming to speak the (sometimes ugly) truth Abby (Katherine Heigl) does anything but. She is a producer of a local morning show in Sacramento who is so uptight she brings talking points to first dates (after first running background checks). We can stop now and you can predict everything that happens for the rest of the movie. If only the filmmakers had. But no like them we soldier on. Abby happens upon Mikes show one night then learns to her horror the next day that her boss has hired Mike to goose ratings. She cannot stand for this lowering of standards this affront to women this . . . huh. He is sort of endearing in a caveman sort of way come to think of it. Mike helps coach Abby through a relationship with Colin (Eric Winter) a perfect-man sort - sensitive a surgeon likes dogs but is really a cat person. Of course this adventure involves Mike and Abby getting to know each other better finding out that each isnt exactly who the other thought and so forth. Hi-jinks abound like the ill-timed misplacing of the remote control for a pair of vibrating panties. Its not a matter of wondering where this will all lead. Its a matter of wondering if theyll go so far to employ the use of a hot-air balloon to get there. And the answer is a resounding yes Butler sleepwalks his way through the film losing whatever momentum he has at the start when hes telling women their best self-help tool is a StairMaster as he dissipates into a puddle of romantic goo. Heigl is a lot more believable as a control freak than when she starts to loosen up a bit. So strong is the quicksand of mediocrity that it sucks down great comic talent like John Michael Higgins and Cheryl Hines who play a husband-and-wife anchor team. Too bad. ""The Ugly Truth?""

Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review The Ugly Truth -- 2 out of 5 stars The Ugly Truth Columbia Pictures Even as she searches for Mr. Right a morning show producer is teamed with a handsome outspoken TV personality. July 24 Even as she searches for Mr. Right a morning show producer is teamed with a handsome outspoken TV personality. July 24 (Columbia Pictures) Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic For an actress trying to escape her Greys Anatomy rut and carve out a movie career Katherine Heigl has been awfully quick to dive into another rut this one on the big screen. Just three romantic comedies into her leading-lady status shes displayed a range that ventures from A as far as B done two movies in which shes played TV producers and claimed that potty-mouthed-girl-next-door title all to herself.What she hasnt done not often enough anyway is charm. The Ugly Truth gives us Heigl as Abby a lonely producer in Sacramento who collides with her struggling morning shows desperate new feature -- a swarthy crude and blunt advice-to-the-lovelorn caveman whose segments promise to tell ""The Ugly Truth"" about men and woman. Gerard Butler is Mike the boorish lout who tells women that ""men are simple."" His advice? ""Its called a Stairmaster. Get on it"" The obvious direction this obvious Robert Luketic film (with script by Nicole Eastman Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith) is to pair up the ""misogynists misogynist"" with a boss who loathes him and let the sparks fly. Instead Abby a control freak who brings ""talking points"" on dates inexplicably turns her love life over to this creep in an effort to attract the pretty-boy doctor who has moved in next door. Mikes giving her advice through an earpiece; she for reasons the movie ignores takes it.Butler has a funny way with a line and a natural comic virility something Heigls previous leads ( Seth Rogen and James Marsdan) lacked. But they dont click as a couple perhaps because theyre kept apart by a wordy script overloaded with blue banter.Ugly Truths money moment is a variation on the When Harry Met Sally orgasm scene involving electrically wired underwear and Heigl plays the heck out of it. Plainly she has identified her niche (Knocked-Up not Sex and the City) and seems intent on pandering to her crowd.But the ugly truth is she still isnt a Sally anyone will cry over no matter who plays her Harry.

""The Ugly Truth"" is an arch contrived entirely predictable romantic comedy assembled with sufficient audience-friendly elements to put it over as both a good girls night attraction and a date-night lure raunchy enough to leave couples in the right mood afterward. As such and with the easy-to-watch Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler as cat and dog who initially hate each other so much that love is the only possible result Sony should expect to reap some far-from-ugly midsummer B.O. returns from this commercially calculated cocktail. Trying like mad to lay claim to a secure place in the sparsely populated realm of bankable comedically oriented leading ladies Heigl rather overplays her hand here as a beauteous control freak whos so domineering with dates she needs advice from a mans man on how to get laid. Its an odd far-fetched twist on the Pygmalion story with the modern angle of poking holes in political correctness one that might have been made marginally convincing by a dollop of backstory or psychology that pretended to explain the womans cluelessness with guys. As it is the strenuous outrage exhibited by Heigls TV producer Abby Richter at being forced to work with Butlers macho-pig shock jock Mike Chadway registers as cartoonish overreaction. Faced with dwindling ratings for her Sacramento-based morning show Abby is saddled with the outwardly rude and crude Chadway when a guest shot by the hitherto obscure public-access TV host provokes strong audience reaction to his rants about how women have to accept the male species basic caveman nature. Bossy and indomitable at work Abby misguidedly applies those same attributes to her personal life which means she has none. When she falls (literally from a tree) into the life of dreamboat neighbor Colin (Eric Winter) she dithers so terribly that she accepts help from Mike who guarantees that if she follows his advice to the letter shell snag her man. Youd think a woman who looks like Heigl wouldnt need to do anything to attract male attention but then again in ""Knocked Up"" she resorted to a tryst with the then-grubby Seth Rogen so perhaps screenwriters Nicole Eastman (a first-timer) and Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith (""Legally Blonde"") know better. In the event Mike supervises Abbys makeover via a shopping spree and new haircut followed by a ballgame date at which Mike like a modern Cyrano instructs Abby over an earphone what to do and say to Colin with mildly disastrous results. Mike prepares his charge for a subsequent date with a gift of some vibrator-equipped undies resulting in another would-be hilarious setpiece in which Abby becomes inadvertently vibrated during a very public business dinner. A director truly adept at carefully constructed slow-burn comedy and a star with disciplined comic gifts could have had a field day with such a scene but what helmer Robert Luketic serves up feels more like a rehearsal than the polished gem it could have been; Heigl doesnt even break a sweat. Wrap-up is inevitable but needlessly hokey and undercut by awfully artificial process photography and visual effects and a cloying musical score. Handicapped by flat makeup plastered-down hair and overly bright lighting Heigl doesnt look too great at the outset which may or may not have been intentional given the storyline. But beyond what the script calls for the thesp comes off as strident and overbearing; she overemphasizes everything in a way that suggests every beat was thought out leaving little room for comic spontaneity. As cracks in Abbys self-assurance show themselves and the character relaxes to Mikes natural charm Heigls appeal emerges but she might advisedly seek projects with more heart. Butler gives Mike an affable lived-in quality that quickly takes the edge off the characters deliberate abrasiveness and encourages the viewer to imagine hes had abundant and varied life experience. Supporting turns are highly caricatured.
