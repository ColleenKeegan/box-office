"Bitchery in Geisha. A splendidly intimate Narnia. Slate Sign In Sign Up Bitchery in Geisha. A splendidly intimate Narnia. Bitchery in Geisha. A splendidly intimate Narnia. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateReel TimeRunning thoughts on movies and their makings.Dec. 9 2005 622 PM Kimono Dragons Only the bitchery clicks in Memoirs of a Geisha. Plus a splendidly intimate Narnia. By David Edelstein Small is beautiful Having little to add to Meghan ORourkes eloquent and persuasive examination of C.S. Lewis Narnia books and the authors allegedly overriding Christianity it falls to this resident film critic to say that The Chronicles of Narnia The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe (Touchstone) has been turned into an entertaining emotional and surprisingly intimate movie--an epic saga of fauns and talking (Cockney) beavers and evil sorceresses and triumphal resurrections and massive sweeping battles that nonetheless feels ... small. Advertisement I dont mean that slightingly. The Lion the Witch etc. begins and ends in the imagination of children experiencing a profound loss--in this case a rain of German bombs on London after which the four Pevensie children (Georgie Henley Skander Keynes William Moseley and Anna Popplewell) are exiled (for their own protection) to the country manse of a distant relative. In the absence of a mother and a father (or of any supportive parental figure) in a universe turned upside down the Pevensies enter a world in which--with the aid of a gravely resplendent lion Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson)--they overcome their earthly fears and desires and fight to vanquish an evil (and vaguely Aryan-Fascist) witch (Tilda Swinton). Theres plenty of busy Lord of the Rings-like sprawl but its the fleeting images that matter most. When little Lucy (Georgie Henley is the most endearing and expressive child actor of the millennium) enters the formidable wardrobe and emerges on the other side of some fur coats into a snow-covered forest its less the setting that captures your imagination. (This isnt one of those fancy Tim Burton-like Expressionist dazzlers.) Its the snowflake on the little girls eyelash. Its Lucys wonder at this place and at the faun (James McAvoy) who befriends her betrays her and then--his conscience getting the best of him--helps her to escape. As directed by Andrew Adamson whose previous directorial credits are for movies that were computer-generated (Shrek and Shrek 2) this is a surprisingly tender and unshowy piece of work. The pacing is leisurely and the atmosphere terribly English--until the big lion-sacrifice scene which has a touch of Mel Gibson-esque cruelty. But then it should shouldnt it? There isnt a trace of humanity in the albino Queen Elizabeth I (or is she Star TreksBorg Queen?) who encases her enemies in ice and smothers the spirit of the land of Narnia with an endless winter--while simultaneously casting out Christmas. (Fascist Liberal) The wrong kind of people (you know who they are) could project a lot of different messages on this fantasy-allegory--right wing left wing fundamentalist (anything but atheist). But like Meghan I prefer to leave its archetypes--well archetypal. For kids and kids-at-heart the best thing about The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe is that in spite of its horrific flourishes and occasional brutalities it depicts a fundamentally safe and reassuring universe in which the fallen are healed and no human sin is terrible enough to go unforgiven. And while Darwinism and Christianity have been torn asunder lately by our more obnoxious elements (you know who you are) it is a vision that is profoundly adaptive ... 325 p.m. PST Fasten your obi ... The tale of an orphaned Japanese girl sold into a house of geishas-in-training (it features nasty-taskmaster crones and a reigning--wildly jealous--diva) Arthur Goldens bestselling novel Memoirs of a Geisha should have yielded a transporting movie Dickens in silk kimonos. But as directed by Rob Marshall (Chicago) its barely there. Memoirs of a Geisha (Columbia) isnt completely clueless like Alan Parkers cinematic nonevent Angelas Ashes. But like Parkers dud it skips lightly over the surface of its rich material more preoccupied with making pretty pictures than dipping below the surface so that you can experience the world through the eyes of its traumatized yet increasingly savvy heroine. It has been something of a scandal in Asia that the principal actresses are Chinese and Malaysian the idea being that theyre better box-office in international (white) markets than Japanese women and that really Wholl know the difference? And everyone speaks (rather mushy) English anyway. Why look Its the lovely Zhang Ziyi from Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and House of Flying Daggers as the grown Sayuri who works her way up from chambermaid to be one of Japans most renowned geishas. In this world of element-based horoscopes Sayuri is supposed to be something of a water spirit (she has blue milky eyes) but Zhang has always struck me as a fire spirit in waifish form. Even with the trickle of water on the soundtrack she seems miscast and so does her sometime co-star the earthy Michelle Yeoh in the role of Sayuris allegedly ethereal geisha tutor. In Goldens book you constantly register the irony that Sayuris rise to power depends on her skill at appearing servile. But with its lickety-split pacing (no image lingers) and romantic John Williams score (what big-budget movie set in Asia is complete without Yo-Yo Ma?) this Memoirs of a Geisha has neither overtones nor undertones. Marshall is a theater guy with a taste for backstage bitchery and the only thing that clicks is the Japanese All About Eve motif--Gong Lis Hatsumomo hissing witchily at poor Sayuri. Rumor has it that Gong learned a lot of her English dialogue phonetically but shes the one member of the cast who speaks with any musicality. That makes sense in a movie that could only have been saved by singing and dancing. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air.

Starring Georgie Henley Skandar Keynes William Moseley Anna Popplewell and Tilda Swinton. Directed by Andrew Adamson. (PG. 140 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Like ""The Lord of the Rings"" C.S. Lewis  ""The Chronicles of Narnia The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"" was the product of a Great Britain that had just been through a war of survival. The story neither was about World War II nor was it an allegory for it and yet it was informed by the moral absolutes and challenges of the wartime period Theres the presence of darkest evil which cant be avoided but must be faced head-on. Theres the grim understanding that sacrifice is necessary that whole worlds are riding on the actions of a handful of individuals. And in the presence of a wickedness so complete as to be supernatural theres faith in absolute goodness. Its a work of profound ambition and in adapting it for the screen the makers of ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" dont shy away from its demands. Rather than reduce the novel to a fairy tale they take up Lewis challenge and make a film that deals with the spiritual underpinnings of existence i.e. the meaning of life. Except for ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy theres no philosophical precedent for this kind of film in recent cinema The idea that life might even have an ultimate meaning goes against the modern trend. Yet this film in no way stands in the trilogys shadow. It may lack the scale of ""The Lord of the Rings"" but it matches it in emotional impact and unlike its big brother it never once gets lost in its special effects. Its a movie of intelligence and power of beauty universality and largeness of spirit. That ""Narnia"" is as good as it is -- its wonderful -- comes almost as a surprise. Director Andrew Adamsons previous films were ""Shrek"" and ""Shrek 2"" crowd-pleasers that neither hinted at his depths nor suggested what he could do with real actors in a live action film. Similarly the screenwriters (Ann Peacock Christopher Markus Stephen McFeely and Adamson) went in with resumes that were short respectable but not particularly promising. And the main actors with the exception of Tilda Swinton as the White Witch are either unknowns or kids. Yet all including and especially those kids do brilliant work. From the start the world is at war. Its Britain during the blitz and everyone is diving for cover including a mother Mrs. Pevensie (Judy McIntosh) and her four children. Following an air raid the mother sends her children into the countryside where they will be safe. And so Lucy Edmund Susan and Peter go to the home of an old professor where they amuse themselves while waiting for the war to end. Within minutes the audience knows its in good hands. The kids personalities and their interrelationships are defined with economy and detail. We know for example that Edmund (Skandar Keynes) is a bad seed troubled sarcastic and disobedient but we also know from what he tries to save in an air raid -- a picture of his father whos away fighting the war -- that he has tender impulses. This good side is no guarantee that he wont ultimately become evil. Lewis is too sophisticated a moral thinker to believe that. But it does mean he could go either way. Lucy the youngest is the first to discover that an armoire or ""wardrobe"" in a spare room is a doorway to an enchanted land. The land is Narnia which exists in perpetual winter ever since a wicked witch (Swinton) put her spell on it. Lucy who is about 9 is played by first-time actress Georgie Henley an auburn-haired girl with a witty character face that can only be English. Shes adorable and a fine instinctive actress. Lucy meets a diffident faun (James McAvoy) and theres something charming almost magical in their interaction. Soon all four children including the two eldest Susan (Anna Popplewell) and Peter (William Moseley) have landed in Narnia and all get dragged into the conflict between the witch and the forces of good led by Aslan a talking lion (voiced by Liam Neeson). That the film is a Christian allegory is beyond dispute. This element is in no way disguised nor should it be as its a major source of the storys power. It functions in two distinct ways. The allegory elevates the tale to the monumental scale of salvation and damnation. And it shows the eternal application of the Christian metaphor working in the Miltonian sense to ""justify the ways of God to man."" Thus despite its enormous secular appeal ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" could also be called the most effective and moving religious picture since Nick Rays ""King of Kings."" Swintons witch is no caricature but a sophisticated portrait of evil as cold as the Narnia climate and remorseless. Her early scene with Edmund in which she charms the boy with sweets is especially fascinating in that her cruelty is conveyed even as she impersonates benevolence. But shes not the only actor in the scene. Keynes has his own complexities and mixed impulses. When everyone even the child actors give extraordinary performances thats no accident. Thats direction. Among the many things we take from ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" -- Lucys wonder as she walks through the snowy forest the Lions sad dignity as he climbs the Scala Santa -- is one thing more The understanding that in Adamson were seeing the emergence of a major talent. -- Advisory This film contains battle scenes.

The tale beloved by many has been ever-so-slightly tweaked not always for the better. Its tone is too emphatic too swoon-y not the work of a reserved British don but animators with blue-screen technology. And Tilda Swintons hair does things unseen since the birth of Whitesnake. But its a sturdy adaptation and if The Chronicles of Narnia the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe doesnt capture the magic of C.S. Lewis books it comes a fair sight close to catching it. Some elements are exactly right the four intrepid Pevensie children the musty wardrobe that opens on the kingdom of Narnia Tumnus the faun (James McAvoy). Aslan the Lion is voiced with thunder (by Liam Neeson) and animated with grace the deft realization of a quadrupedal moral paragon. Some consider him a Jesus figure others not but however you address him hes the rumbling heart of the film. The story goes as follows One day whilst playing hide-and-seek in a country manse little Lucy (Georgie Henley) discovers a wardrobe filled with furs. At the back she finds the entrance to a snowy wood -- and the genial parcel-laden Mr. Tumnus who invites her back for tea. She partakes not realizing Mr. Tumnus plans on handing her over to the ashen and evil White Witch (Swinton) who has reigned over 100 years of winter in the land of Narnia. In a fit of conscience he instead sends Lucy home to her sister Susan (Anna Popplewell) and her brothers Edmund (Skandar Keynes) and Peter (William Moseley). Next through the wardrobe is Edmund who betrays his siblings to the White Witch for a tin of Turkish Delight. When the four Pevensies arrive in Narnia they meet Mr. and Mrs. Beaver (Ray Winstone and Dawn French) who speak of Aslan and repeat an ancient prophesy that ""two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve"" will defeat the Witch and rule Narnia as kings and queens. Meaning of course Peter Susan Lucy and Edmund. Director Andrew Adamson (Shrek and Shrek 2) and a busy stable of screenwriters have taken a confident hand to their source material preserving many of its most charming conceits while cranking up the drama. Things barely or not at all detailed by Lewis are given full treatment here from the childrens wartime evacuation of London (in the film their home gets bombed) to Edmunds eventual imprisonment by the White Witch. In this the age of digitized Tolkien its too much to ask for a sword-and-sorcery film to eschew hyper-produced battle sequences but all the same A few items should have been left to the imagination. Im not sure we needed to see every last Cruel and Hag and Incubus (""whom I wont describe because if I did the grown-ups probably would not let you read this book"") but there they are rubbing elbows with steroidal cyclopean Neanderthals and revolting flying things. And I wish the film had retained a narrator; Adamsons version sorely misses the unruffled compassionate voice that guides the reader through Narnia. The movie could have used a dose of calm. But the kids are stalwart their upper lips stiff plucky Lucy defiant Edmund valiant Peter cautious Susan. Adamsons young leads never succumb to the sentimentality that surges elsewhere in Narnia particularly Harry Gregson-Williams score. ""Were not heroes"" Peter explains. Adds Susan ""Were from Finchley.""

And one need not be of a particular monotheistic bent to see -better stillbe moved - by that notion. The youngest of four war refugees sent from bomb-blitzed London to the safety of the British countryside during World War II Lucy makes a winning guide in director Andrew Adamsons loving adaptation of C.S. Lewis book written in 1950. Many of you are well aware that Lucy and her siblings - in ascending birth order Edmund Susan and Peter - become our human surrogates once they travel to Narnia a magical realm where fauns centaurs and chatty animals have been enduring a 100-year cold snap. But when they arrive in Coombe Halt station the estate of professor Kirke (Jim Broadbent) with its stairwells and myriad rooms is mostly a good place to get lost. Policed by a high-handed housekeeper the children come to call The MacReady there are reasons aplenty for the four to make themselves scarce. A game of indoor hide-and- seek leads Lucy to a sheet-covered armoire. In she goes. When the closet crowded with furs gives way to a snowy forest of firs the magic begins. In the woods Lucy meets a faun named Tumnus. His ears extend horizontally. His lower half is covered with a rough pelt and theres the matter of his cloven hooves. Over tea Tumnus tells Lucy the history of frostbitten Narnia. Played with sweet tentativeness by James McAvoy Tumnus turns melancholy then guilt-ridden. Why? Because hes bound to deliver Lucy a human to the White Witch (Tilda Swinton). But he just cant Georgie Henleys Lucy is so open that her wee humanity transforms others. When Lucy returns from Narnia Peter is still counting Susan and Edmund are still hiding. Time too is a different animal in Narnia. Lucy has returned with a story to tell. One alas her oldest siblings dont believe. Soon enough troublesome Edmund (Skandar Keynes) trails Lucy into Narnia where he meets the White Witch. Its a meeting bound to make most of us queasy and not because Edmund keeps demanding Turkish delight. The witch is more imperious than imperial but her icy beauty has a certain heat. Belief and its relationship to rationality is a theme here - and the lesson Kirke gives Peter (William Moseley) and Susan (Anna Popplewell) about their sisters maiden sojourn offers a fine rebuttal to too hasty doubt in the face of the inexplicable. Eventually all four Pevensies travel through the wardrobe - and when they do they begin to fulfill a prophecy about the two daughters of Eve and two sons of Adam arriving to help Aslan end the White Witchs rule. Tumnus is but one of the fabulously rendered beasts of Narnia. Some will become allies others foes. Regardless one of the cinematic gifts of Adamsons movie (which he adapted ever so gently with Ann Peacock Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) is that every beast every mythical creature beguiles. From Tumnus (prosthetically enhanced) to the lupine chief of the White Witchs not-so-secret police the yammering Mr. and Mrs. Beaver and the Christ-like lion Aslan (all CGI-tweaked) Adamson delivers the magic of cinema. These moments more than make up for occasionally jarring images of the kids against a screened vista. Adamson and company have made a tender improvement on Lewis text by making headstrong Edmund more responsible for his betrayals. Edmund doesnt need bewitched candy to be jealous of Lucy or resentful of golden bro Peter; he doesnt need candy to fall hook line and sinker over some adults wicked come-ons. And one of the sublime images in ""Chronicles"" comes when Edmund has a moment of reckoning with Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson). Forgiveness transforms. Trusting in the impossible has its own deep and magical logic. Death is not always what it seems. All these notions of course have roots in C.S. Lewis Christian faith. But to its credit and power the film allows them a reach that exceeds any one religions grasp.

"Chronicles of Narnia The The Voyage of the Dawn Treader | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; chronicles-of-narnia-the-the-voyage-of-the-dawn-treader ) Chronicles of Narnia The The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (United States 2010) December 07 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli The Chronicles of Narnia The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is fantasy-lite. With its PG rating and aversion to anything shocking or overly grotesque its the bastard stepchild of The Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter. A dull meandering storyline and visuals all-but destroyed by a second-rate 3-D conversion make this movie inferior to its predecessors The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe and Prince Caspian. The ""quest"" element a common fantasy staple is uninspired and perfunctory and theres a growing sense throughout the movie that theres no real point to any of what is occurring. This isnt much a problem in C.S. Lewis source novel an allegorical childrens fable about faith and the fantastical but it does not translate well to a motion picture. In 2005 following the success of The Lord of the Rings and the early Harry Potter films Disney decided they wanted their own fantasy franchise. Instead of choosing something newer and edgier they went with C.S. Lewis The Chronicles of Narnia a lightweight in the genre but one that could deliver two key demographics younger children and church-going Christians. The latter group was specifically targeted because of Lewis religious reputation and his admission that his beloved books were Christian allegories. However after the success of The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe enthusiasm dried up for Prince Caspian. Disney disappointed by the box office returns of the second installment and concerned that the lack of a narrative drive in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader could make it unpopular bailed on the series. 20th Century Fox replaced Disney as Walden Medias partner in the venture but this could be a one-film deal. Unless The Voyage of the Dawn Treader does better in multiplexes than is currently predicted Narnias live-action feature films will stall at three. (The series contains seven books although two are outside the main chronology.) The Last Battle will probably never reach the screen which is disappointing since it would have been interesting to see how the filmmakers might have handled an apocalyptic story that is essentially unfilmable. The Voyage of the Dawn Treader begins as the previous installments did in our world with England enmeshed in World War II. The two younger Pevensie children Lucy (Georgie Henley) and Edmund (Skandar Keynes) have gone to live with their cousin Eustace Scrubb (Will Poulter). Its at the Scrubb house while gazing at a painting of a ship that the three children are magically transported to Narnia. For Lucy and Edmund this is their third visit. For the skeptical and self-centered Eustace its his inaugural journey to the fantasy world so beloved by his relatives. Caspian (Ben Barnes) once prince and now king is on hand to pull the three children from the sea. They find themselves voyaging on The Dawn Treader the pride of Narnias fleet. The king is on a mission to discover the whereabouts of seven lords and seven swords that have gone missing. The ship has set off to explore the Eastern Seas beyond the Lone Islands and possibly even discover Aslans Country. In an attempt to bring some structure to the narrative the movie occasionally departs in significant ways from the book. In fact arguably the most energetic element of the movie - a lengthy battle with a gigantic sea serpent - has been contrived for the screen. Still even with the quest sharpened (the seven swords when gathered and placed on Aslans Table can shift the balance from evil to good and free the prisoners of The Dark Island) The Voyage of the Dawn Treader meanders. The trek demands nearly two hours but its hard to argue that the destination is worth the time investment. Character development is perfunctory. Theres an irony here; director Michael Apted is best known for his Up Series of movies cinematic records of the lives of a group of British men and women over 42 years (and counting). As such Apted is the author of arguably the greatest documentary character study ever committed to film. One would expect more vivid - or at least interesting - personalities to emerge even from a fictional endeavor. However despite this being the third time viewers have traveled alongside Lucy and Edmund they fail to stand out as memorable or remarkable. A similar complaint can be made about Caspian although this is only his second movie. Eustace is a generic brat. The two most compelling individuals are brought to life by special effects the swashbuckling mouse Reepicheep (whose voice is provided by Simon Pegg) and Eustace the Dragon. Once the boy has become a monster he carries the tragedy of his circumstances like a mantle and its touching to see the dragons tears. More than in either of the previous movies Lewis Christian philosophy is evident. The main theme is about faith and Aslans role as a Christ figure is brought out of the subtext when the Lion acknowledges that he exists in the real world but is called by another name. Lucy and Edmund he advises should come to know him there in his other guise. Excepting The Last Battle its possible to read the books and not think of the theology as being heavy-handed. Yet thats precisely how it feels in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. The productions special effects are generally strong and some shots have the potential to be quite beautiful. The dragon for example is impressive as is the giant sea serpent that harries the ship during the climax. Unfortunately the 3-D is so bad that it muddies a lot of whats on screen. Having experienced the first ten minutes in both 2-D and 3-D I can comment with authority that the 2-D version is superior in every way sharper brighter and more colorful. The 3-D adds little except a surcharge while detracting from the experience as a whole. Its not quite as bad as Clash of the Titans and The Last Airbender but its close. The Voyage of the Dawn Treader features some odd shifts in tone. A sequence involving a group of invisible creatures feels like it was lifted from an unproduced Monty Python movie. Eustaces character arc contains elements of pathos. And theres sadness at the end when the finality of certain farewells is made clear. Throughout the movie many common fantasy elements are present including a dungeon and a dragon but the essential simplicity and lack of ambition make The Voyage of the Dawn Treader an unremarkable and somewhat boring trip.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor December 9 2005 Save for later Saved In a recently discovered note by C.S. Lewis from 1959 he wrote ""Anthropomorphic animals when taken out of narrative into actual visibility always turn into buffoonery and nightmare.""Which is exactly what doesnt happen in ""The Chronicles of Narnia The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe"" - at least not the buffoonery part. (Despite the films PG rating the mayhem is probably too intense for small children.) Andrew Adamson the director of the two ""Shrek"" films has done a highly creditable job of visualizing the first of Lewiss seven books about four children in the mythical land of Narnia where the animals do indeed talk.The film which is much closer in look to the books original illustrations by Pauline Baynes than might have been predicted works surprisingly well both as a boisterous fantasia and as the Christian fable that Lewis intended. (The films prologue in blitzed London is the only serious departure from Lewiss text.) Having dutifully made my way through ""The Matrix"" movies ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy and the ""Harry Potter"" series I wasnt sure I was up for another full-scale franchise. But ""Chronicles of Narnia"" is no machine-tooled commercial enterprise. Beneath all the special effects (many of which are actually special) you can detect something recognizably and cherishably human. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? One of the reasons why childrens films are rightly held in such disrepute these days is because they dont look as if they were made by people who were ever children themselves. Adamson successfully makes the transition to live-action filmmaking because for him as for C.S. Lewis there is no clear aesthetic demarcation between fantasy and reality. The nymphs and fauns and minotaurs are of a piece with the children who are blessedly un-Disneyfied. They have the eccentricities of actual children - which in this case means the valiant English variety that appreciates good manners and sardines on toast. I particularly liked Georgie Henleys Lucy with her querulous big eyes and overbite who discovers Narnia. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 She does so of course by walking into the wardrobe closet in the country estate where she and her brothers and sisters are being sheltered from the war. But Narnia introduces them to a wider and more elemental war with Tilda Swintons White Witch holding sway over a land in perpetual winter. (One look at her will freeze you too.) The messianic lion Aslan the storys Christ figure if one chooses to see him that way is on the side of the good. As these two battle it out you wont be thinking of ""Shrek."" Spiritual redemption is a big theme of ""Narnia"" but on a purely entertainment level the movie also goes a long way in redeeming the current sad state of childrens fantasy filmmaking. Grade A- Rated PG for battle sequences and frightening moments.

Walt Disney Pictures/Walden Based on the classic childrens series by C.S. Lewis Narnia is an adventure in a fantasy world filled with talking animals unicorns and centaurs who join in a climactic battle between good and evil. Its epic scope and elaborate battles will raise comparisons with Peter Jacksons adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkiens trilogy though the clashes are much less violent. Shrek director Andrew Adamson makes an impressive live-action film debut with this energetic adaptation of the 1950 novel. Although much has been made of the films Christian subtext Narnia is first and foremost an action-packed fairy tale. Lewis a British scholar created Aslan the kindly lion who sacrifices himself as a Christ-like figure. The religious references (children are referred to as ""sons of Adam and daughters of Eve"") may go unnoticed by children but they will be noted by their parents. The movie begins powerfully with a World War II bombing of London. The following scene of a crowded train station with legions of children being sent out of the beleaguered city is poignant and explains the wars context for younger audiences. The four Pevensie children are sent off by their mother (Judy McIntosh) to live in the countryside out of harms way. Once they arrive at the artifact-filled mansion of Professor Kirke (Jim Broadbent) they play hide-and-seek at the urging of young Lucy (Georgie Hensley). She hides in a closet where behind a collection of fur coats she stumbles into the enchanted world of Narnia. Once there she makes the acquaintance of a troubled faun Mr. Tumnus (James McAvoy). He laments that in icy Narnia ""Its always winter but never Christmas."" Lucys older brothers (Skandar Keynes and William Moseley) and sister (Anna Popplewell) venture with her into the alternate universe and become embroiled in extricating the faun and other woodland creatures from the evil clutches of the White Witch (a terrifyingly cold Tilda Swinton). The children do a fine job in inhabiting their characters but the cinematography and special effects are the most noteworthy. The computer-generated characters are beautifully realized and enhanced by the actors lending their voices. Liam Neeson is commanding as Aslan who created Narnia and counsels the children. Though it drags in parts particularly in the protracted clashes between odd-looking creatures The Chronicles of Narnia is a faithful rendering of a magical tale that should hold adults attention and delight young moviegoers. (Rated PG for battle sequences and frightening moments. Running time 2 hours 20 minutes.)

Tolkiens reign as box-office king has run its course old colleague C. S. Lewis is being nominated as his successor with ""The Chronicles of Narnia The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe."" While ""Rings""-level B.O. totals wont be matched theres little doubt Disneys massive marketing push will be banking money from this one for the indefinite future. Now that J.R.R. Tolkiens reign as box-office king among dead Oxford fantasy authors has run its course old colleague C. S. Lewis is being nominated as his successor with ""The Chronicles of Narnia The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe."" Not nearly as imposing as ""The Lord of the Rings"" as mythology drama or literature Lewis series of seven modest-length books has nevertheless been popular since ""Lion"" first appeared in 1950. Just coincidentally it also provides the opportunity for the sorts of extravagant computerized effects that create tentpole movie attractions these days. While ""Rings""-level B.O. totals wont be matched theres little doubt Disneys massive marketing push in the service of a competently made film that appeals to all demographics will be banking money from this one for the indefinite future. Unlike the much more demanding and young-adult-oriented ""Rings"" cycle Lewis tomes are geared toward children. To many adults they can seem simplistic somewhat derivative and downright odd if analyzed as Christian fable or metaphor. ""Lion"" functions best as a ""Wizard of Oz""-like trip an expression of innocent parent-deprived childrens imaginative escape from dreary reality into an exquisite but perilous world of starkly personified good and evil dominated by animals human-like characters and a witch. Like ""Oz"" it similarly ends with the leads confounding decision to return to that dull reality rather than to stay in a wondrous land where they are regarded as heroes and royalty. Like Peter Jacksons ""Rings"" trilogy ""The Lion"" is presented -- by famously family-friendly producer Mark Johnson along with Philip Steuer -- on a gargantuan scale and to a great extent on New Zealand locations. What it lacks in complexity distinguished Anglo-Aussie-Yank thespians and transcendent screen magic it somewhat compensates for by way of the strong casting of mostly unfamiliar faces a convincing family feeling among the four kids solid storytelling and fluid interplay between the humans and four-legged creatures; as in ""Shrek"" director Andrew Adamson displays an equal opportunity attitude toward all critters human or otherwise. Escaping one war zone merely to find another siblings Peter Susan Edmund and little Lucy are spirited out of London during the blitz by their mother to the calm of a distant country estate inhabited by the Professor (Jim Broadbent). During a game of hide-and-seek Lucy (Georgie Henley) ducks into a large wardrobe only to find herself transported into a wintery forest where she meets a faun Mr. Tumnus (James McAvoy) a half-man half-goat who expresses wonder at the arrival of a girl he calls the ""daughter of Eve"" and invites her to his cozy abode. Big-eyed snub-nosed and pleasantly plump Henley conveys a contagious curiosity that makes her an ideal conduit for the wonderment one is meant to feel in this new world. It falls to the faun to explain that Narnia is ruled by a terrible queen the White Witch who keeps the land in eternal winter and has prevented Christmas from coming for 100 years. Although the queen has decreed that any human found in Narnia must be delivered straight to her Mr. Tumnus lets her go. On Lucys second trip through the wardrobe she is followed by doubting brother Edmund (Skandar Keynes very good at skepticism and incipient mischief) who is promptly found by the queen (the ideally cast Tilda Swinton) and seduced into believing he will be made a prince and eventually the king of Narnia if he brings his siblings back with him. Pics central adventure starts at the 40-minute mark as Lucy and Edmund are joined by older Peter (William Moseley) and Susan (Anna Popplewell) to wander around the forest until being taken in by Mr. and Mrs. Beaver Cockney-accented computer animated critters who regale them with news of the imminent arrival of the great leonine savior Aslan. And a savior they will need as disgruntled Edmund has slipped away to see the queen only to be thrown into a frigid cell along with the faun. Informed of the interlopers arrival the witch dispatches her flying monkeys ... errr marauding wolves ... to intercept them. The films most brilliantly animated creatures the wolves feature in two or three scary scenes that along with some violent battle moments push the film to and perhaps beyond the invisible line between PG and PG-13 territory; simply put unprepared smallfry may get more than they can handle. With the entrance of the Lion King ... errr Aslan ... the enterprise is endowed with a gravitas that lends the drama moral purpose and inspires the hitherto peaceable and arguably wimpy English kids to advanced levels militaristic determinism. As voiced with ringingly noble Irish-Anglo clarity by Liam Neeson Aslan is prone -- as a well-known wizard once said -- to think deep thoughts. His uncanny ability to say and do the right thing extends to realms that mortal men and beasts cant comprehend when he makes a private deal with the queen that entails sacrificing himself for the greater good. This scene staged as an act of ancient ritual that Mel Gibson would appreciate is another that the impressionable may find tough to watch as it is for Susan and Lucy who have accompanied Aslan on his fateful journey. The lions eventual resurrection is crucial to the Christian overlay in Lewis work and while this element may help ""Lion"" lure Gibsons passionate audience to untold upward B.O. effect the film does not stress its religious parallels. Pics credibility hinges as much on the visualization of the lion as on anything else. Compared with the wolves the imposing Aslan looks somewhat less lifelike at first; his expressions seem a bit posed and the waviness of his mane and other hair isnt entirely naturalistic. But one soon accepts him as his movements carry a deliberate composure and Neesons sonorous readings convey a steady dignity. Climactic battle the scale of which has rather more to do with ""The Lord of the Rings"" than with anything in Lewis text is marked not only by its spectacle but by its unique constituency; both sides are populated not only by recognizable members of the animal kingdom but by creatures of unfathomable origin combination man-beasts divided by the beautiful (on Aslans side) and the repugnant (the queens minions). Good triumphs of course and an end-credits insert leaves the wardrobe door wide open for a sequel as Lucy asks the Professor ""Will we ever go back?"" to which he replies ""I expect so."" Although there are a few obvious process shots and telltale painted backdrops the films design elements and special and visual effects are mostly impressive; seemingly the only thing the tech maestros couldnt pull off is making the characters breath visible in the mostly winter settings. Combined efforts of production designer Roger Ford costume designer Isis Mussenden visual effects supervisor Dean Wright creature and visual concept designer Richard Taylor special makeup and creatures creators Howard Berger and Gregory Nicotero and an array of supporting craftspeople pull the viewer into a credible alternative world even if the film itself is more prosaic than inspiring. The kids work well together although the more upright personalities of the older siblings prevent Moseley and Popplewell from being as entertaining as are Henley and Keynes. As white as a vampire Swinton leavens her icy queen with nary a whit of vulnerability while McAvoy invests the faun with welcome nuances of character. James Cosmo brings a robust humanity to his cameo as Father Christmas whose arrival in Narnia portends the end of the queens rule. Harry Gregson-Williams score brings helpful vigor to the enterprise which in addition to New Zealand was partially shot in Poland the Czech Republic England and Guatemala.

Lewis ageless tales of Narnia are too Christian or not Christian enough or the wrong kind of Christian children the world over will yawn politely and read on. I must have devoured The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe at least 10 times while growing up in an aggressively Anglican culture and it never once occurred to me that Aslan the super-lion died the death of Christ and was similarly resurrected. Nor would it have bothered my little Jewish soul had someone set me straight. The thrill of Narnia is all about a fusty old closet that turns out to be full of frostbitten foliage and possibility in which your drab brown life with all its vague fears and longings gives way to a sparkling white alternate universe where kids just like you take tea with those of cloven hoof and warm brown pelt; where good and evil (give or take the odd Judas within your midst) are more cleanly defined and divided than ever they are in life; and where freshly minted heroes do battle to defrost the world for freedom.Lewis may never have mastered fantasy like his friend and rival J.R.R. Tolkien whose Lord of the Rings was a special-effects bonanza waiting to happen. But Lewis understood far more clearly that character drives even the most supernatural of stories and Shreks Andrew Adamson who has never made a live-action movie until now honors that old-fashioned insight while proving himself a fine director of flesh-and-blood kids to boot. Except for Tilda Swintons razzle-dazzle White Witch who gets her own computer-generated polar-bear sleigh drivers and freezes adversaries at will with her long shapely fingers the special effects in The Chronicles of Narnia arent exactly to die for. The fauns hooves look glued-on; the bickering beavers (cutely voiced by Ray Winstone and Dawn French) are straight out of Disney; the battle scenes no more than capable. More problematically Aslan (Liam Neeson) a photo-realist creation with a touch of stuffed toy about him is a sight cuddlier than Lewis -- who favored roaring vengeful deities -- would have approved of.But the four young actors who play the children (especially Georgie Henley a poised munchkin who brings a warm brio to the pivotal role of little Lucy whose innocence drives the story) make a gratifyingly solidary ensemble and it doesnt hurt that William Moseleys Peter the once and future king of a free Narnia is quite the ringer for Britains bonnie Prince William. By staying focused on the children -- frightened evacuees from the London Blitz whose parallel war in Narnia both taps into and finally quiets their unspoken terrors -- Adamson keeps faith with the humanity of Lewsis tale. And if Narnia according to Adamson is more a democratic war on crypto-fascist totalitarianism than a holy war against the non-Christian barbarian I for one wont be filing a complaint.

Spot the telltale signs a central cast of well-spoken British schoolkids with a penchant for fighting dark forces; a strange and distant land (ie New Zealand); the seamless interaction of man and creature; the triumph of good over evil via an epic battle; the promise of endless sequels and cereal box tie-ins...Fans of CS Lewiss book can rest easy. Disney - in cahoots with Republican US oil tycoon Philip Anschutzs production company Walden Media - has preserved the substance and flavour of the first instalment of Lewiss seven-book Narnia cycle. As in the novel the oh-so-prim-and-proper Pevensie siblings - Peter Edmund Susan and Lucy - are evacuated from Blitz-stricken suburban Finchley to the large rural home of a mysterious academic (Jim Broadbent). One by one they fall through the back of a wardrobe and discover Narnia a snowy expanse where the White Witch (a sinister Tilda Swinton) has decreed that it should always be winter and Aslan a big-hearted lion (voiced by Liam Neeson) calls on the same four children to assume political leadership and steer Narnia back to stability and happiness.Its a very British very twee fantasy and for discerning adults an odd cocktail of the New Testament ideals of medieval kingship and 1940s family values. (Some modern suburban snobberies persist too the beavers as voiced by Ray Winstone and Dawn French are petit-bourgeois Essex homeowners.) And how big is the Jesus factor? Director Andrew Adamson (Shrek) doesnt ignore the Christian allegory in Lewiss story. There are clear scenes of crucifixion resurrection and ascension (the last involving Aslan walking along a beach at sunset is unfortunately comic; in a more pious scene Lucy and Susan bow their heads like two Marys beneath the cross). Its also made clear that good humans owe their political inheritance to God as newly-crowned King of Narnia Peter (William Moseley) resembles Oliviers Henry V.These subtleties will of course be lost on children and the film is no more explicitly preachy than the book. Judged kindly Adamson and his team have created a film that is charming fun and carefully realised even if it loses steam and magic when it succumbs to an overlong battle-scene towards the end and never matches either Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings for visual excitement. Still the idea of religion colluding with flagrant commercialism a la The Passion of the Christ remains unpalatable. At least we dont have to deal with Aslans bloody weeping wounds.

Lewis Ann Peacock; Release Date Wide 12/09/2005; Runtime (in minutes) 140; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor Walt Disney Productions Posted July 31 2012 -- 1200 AM EDT Alice down the rabbit hole tumbled into a Wonderland of vanity and vice -- the real world etched in satirical acid -- and her early-20th-century American counterpart Dorothy found Oz with its surreal yokels and charlatans to be just as crackpot a place. But when C.S. Lewis wrote his own variation on rabbit hole metaphysics The Chronicles of Narnia The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe in which he dispatched four very proper British children into the haunted and mystical winterland of Narnia he wasnt fooling around or even cracking a smile. You can read the seven volumes of The Chronicles of Narnia as a Christian allegory or as an ornate book of wonder (or both) but either way its marked by the devout almost pristine earnestness of Lewis sincerity and gravitas. Narnia a land of fauns talking beavers a dastardly White Witch and a solemn savior of a lion may sound like the stuff of filigreed fairy tales but its really a place of holy war where the imagination darkens the more it expands. In the lavish spirited at times naggingly literal-minded movie version of the hugely popular first Narnia tale youre often aware that youre watching child actors romp through a land of concocted creatures and special effects. The snow is too studio-set frosty and Mr. and Mrs. Beaver voiced by Ray Winstone and Dawn French as an engaging pair of fussbudgets come a little too close to the goofy polar bears in Coke commercials; you can see the digital seams. The centaurs satyrs and assorted other magic folk of the wood often look as if theyd just stepped out of a makeup trailer. Director Andrew Adamson in his live-action debut (after Shrek and Shrek 2) stages The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe with a wide-eyed prosaic eagerness that reminds me a little of the Hollywood fantasy films of the late 60s. Even when Adamson brings off a lovely touch such as the White Witch (Tilda Swinton) tempting young Edmund (Skandar Keynes) by creating ice sculptures that turn into fruit-filled Turkish Delight we dont quite feel how the devilish dessert has corrupted the boys heart. Yet the movie for all its half-baked visual marvels remains remarkably faithful to Lewis story and the innocence of his passion begins to shine through. Its there most spectacularly in Aslan the lion-king messiah. For once a computerized beast looks like hes talking and hes voiced by Liam Neeson in velvet seductive tones of lordly compassion. Swinton as the White Witch makes a worthy enemy rearing up during the climactic battle like a rock star of cold self-love. The war itself with its digital tumult will look familiar to anyone who saw the Lord of the Rings films but if Peter Jackson did it better The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe by summoning C.S. Lewis spirit creates a different kind of spectacle -- a starry-eyed crusade. Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.
