In what sounds like the worst sitcom pilot of 1977 George (Eugene Levy) a disgraced CFO is placed in Witness Protection -- which means that he and his spoiled family have to hide out in Madeas house. But the culture clash fizzles. Georges son asks for Wi-Fi and Madea says ""Sure I can make you a waffle."" Thats one of the good jokes.

(My Blue Heaven written by the late Nora Ephron came close while the Larry the Cable Guy opus Witless Protection and the Hugh Grant travesty Did You Hear about the Morgans? uh didnt.) It would be a fools errand to think Tyler Perry might have been the one to finally pull it off. But still Madeas Witness Protection holds some initial promise what with Eugene Levy playing a disingenuous Wall Street type who becomes the fall guy for his companys just-exposed Ponzi scheme and has to go South with his beautifully dysfunctional family. Of course Levy amp; Co. have to live with the grotesque Madea (Perry cross-dressing as usual in the role thats made him a gazillionaire) and one hopes for a brief instant that in imagining this culture clash Perry might be trying to break out of his comfort zone maybe even taking on some of the assumptions made about his comedy -- that it appeals mainly to African-American audiences that its vulgar theatricality is an acquired taste etc. Alas there may be some ambition to the concept but theres none to the execution. Instead what we get are typical fish-out-of-water cliches and blandly packaged life lessons with Levy and the rest of the cast phoning it all in. But Witness Protection is so wan and dispiriting that it might make you yearn for the uncomfortable tonal hodgepodge of earlier Tyler Perry movies. Unlike other Madea films Witness Protection wasnt a play before it became a movie but it still feels strangely stagebound The story unfolds as a series of exchanges in a series of rooms often between two people. For all the communal boisterousness one might expect from this sort of thing (and there is one pretty funny scene involving Levy starting to speak in tongues at church) it feels internalized claustrophobic. Thats not necessarily a bad thing but Perry as a director not only has no visual style he seems uninterested in one. His governing aesthetic is point-and-shoot functionality which might have worked if there were any energy to the proceedings. When I first saw Madea in Diary of a Mad Black Woman she had such a crazy unreal vitality that for all the broad unpleasant comedy on display I couldnt take my eyes off her. The movie was bad but you werent about to forget this creation. This time around Madea just seems spent. Perrys delivery barely registers above a mutter and the jokes which have always been obvious lack conviction. Hes still a young guy but all throughout Witness Protection I imagined Perry sitting glumly at a dressing-room mirror like the aging Chaplin in Limelight forlornly rubbing makeup in his face -- a tired old clown stuck in a tired old routine. Ive never cared for the mans shtick but I kind of hope he regains his mojo someday.

The films best gags--such as Madeas elderly brother Joe (Perry again) trying to determine if Levys character is his illegitimate son--stem from the resulting culture clash. The writer-director-star still hasnt learned to smoothly blend broad comedy and family-values sermonizing. His out-of-costume supporting performance as an FBI agent (a foil who gets about as much screen time as the title character) suggests he may be tiring of his own drag routine even if audiences arent.

Tyler Perrys Madeas Witness Protection Bad Director Tyler Perry. Cast Perry Eugene Levy Denise Richards Doris Roberts. Rating PG-13 for some crude sexual remarks and brief drug references. Instead shes the one doing the protecting after she opens her Atlanta home to hide a family of rich New Yorkers caught up in a Bernie Madoff-like Ponzi scheme. Chief suspect George Needleman played by archetypical schlub Eugene Levy is a patsy but that wont matter to the feds if he cant prove it. And that of course is far more plot than anybody needs to know about the latest outing by Perry the playwright turned filmmaker whose lowbrow comedies rake in millions of dollars. In a Tyler Perry movie the plot is just an excuse to milk cheap laughs out of his stereotypical characters. For proof consider how little mileage ""Witness Protection"" gets out of its fish-out-of-water premise. ""I wanna know how Im gonna hide five White folks in a neighborhood that dont even have any white cats or white cars"" Madea complains but the only ethnic conflicts that arise are inside the house mostly thanks to Georges senile mother (Doris Roberts of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"") whos convinced that her hostess is the maid. Madea takes this with surprisingly good humor perhaps because the arrival of the Needlemans gives her a source of inspiration for her signature malapropisms mishearing WiFi as ""waffle"" and yoga as ""Yoda."" She also gets to play the notorious role of Magic Negro fixing the strained relationship between Georges angry teenage daughter and his inexplicably hot second wife (played by Denise Richards the former Mrs. Charlie Sheen). Madeas tactic? She gives the ingrate a guilt trip by telling her that her family has been murdered by the Mob. (""It worked didnt it?"") How much of this is actually funny is a question of taste but even a confirmed Perry hater might get caught laughing once or twice. Cross-dressing may be one of the oldest comic gambits in the book but Perry knows how to work it as when he chicken-struts with oh-no-you-didnt indignation at the back-talking teenager. On the other hand as a comedy writer Perry contents himself with low-hanging fruit. Advising George on how to survive prison for example Madea warns him ""Just dont drop the soap."" Equally crass are the insults she exchanges with her brother Joe also played by Perry. (One particularly distasteful laugh line ""Shut up rectum"") Furthermore when it comes to constructing a compelling believable story well lets just say its a good bet that Perry didnt spent a lot of time researching investment banking assets investigation or witness protection. But theres no point in asking whether a federal prosecutor would really put up a suspect at his aunts house. Tyler Perry doesnt have to make sense or a have a point. Hes laughing all the way to the bank. Reach the reviewer at kerry.lengelarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4896.

Without neglecting his base prolific multihyphenate Tyler Perry makes a fair bid for crossover success with ""Madeas Witness Protection"" another rowdy comedy constructed around the trash-talking quick-tempered materfamilias of an extended African-American family. This time Madea (Perry in drag) must open her home to a conspicuously Caucasian dysfunctional family at the request of her nephew (Perry in a business suit) a federal prosecutor who must hide the clan from mob killers. The interaction among opposites inspires an abundance of predictable race-based jokes many of which have the saving grace of actually being funny. Eugene Levy hits all the right notes as George Needleman a Wall Street investment bank exec whos been set up as a fall guy for one of his companys shadier sidelines a mob-backed Ponzi operation that has bilked charities for millions. Desperate to avoid a long-term prison sentence the oblivious bean-counter agrees to relocate with his family -- trophy second wife Kate (Denise Richards) sullen teen daughter Cindy (Danielle Campbell) overweight son Howie (Devan Leos) and borderline-senile mom Barbara (Doris Roberts) -- to Madeas quiet little corner of Atlanta. The Needlemans expect to stay with Madea and her grumpy brother Uncle Joe (Perry in old-age makeup and overalls) until George finds a way to help prosecutors track down the millions diverted by the mob. But thats just long enough for Madea to share with George and Kate her distinctive tough-love methods for rearing troublesome children and for George and Madea to launch a bold plan to retrieve the missing money on their own. ""Witness Protection"" is something less than waterproof when it comes to adhering to its own inner logic. Although much is made of the need for the Needlemans to maintain a low profile -- and to avoid sticking out as white folks in a neighborhood where as Madea warns ""nothin aint white"" -- Madea insists on enrolling both Cindy and Howie in a local school. (Perry wisely refrains from showing the siblings intermingling with classmates.) Late in the story Madea appears to pull off a profitable scam but theres no pay-off narrative-wise for this plot twist. Even so pic features enough raucous humor to please longtime fans of the Madea franchise while soft-pedaling the spiritual uplift that Perry typically oversells in his comedies. Better still Perry has almost entirely eschewed the soap-operatics that have weighed heavily in his previous efforts. Here hes playing almost entirely for laughs and its a winning game plan more often than not. Special credit must go to Roberts for finding a fresh way to play a cliched character -- and for the amusement she and Perry generate during a deftly sustained scene in which Barbara and Uncle Joe remember a decades-earlier close encounter. Richards also gets a few laughs when she channels her inner Madea to deal with her misbehaved kids. As usual Madea tends to dominate the proceedings through sheer force of her unrestrained bluster and it must be noted that Perrys over-the-top shtick in this role is wearing thin. On the other hand Madeas fish-out-of-water antics during a third-act trip to New York prove funny enough to suggest that if he wants to sustain this franchise Perry would do well to take his act on the road more often. Tech values are adequate. Tyler Perrys Madeas Witness ProtectionProductionA Lionsgate release presented with Tyler Perry Studios of a Tyler Perry Studios/Lionsgate production.

"Review Tyler Perrys Madeas Witness Protection a sloppy effort - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesReview Tyler Perrys Madeas Witness Protection a sloppy effortTyler Perrys feisty Madea is back in guardian mode with Witness Protection but a slapdash Madoff-like storyline makes it hard to go along with the zany fun.June 29 2012|By Mark Olsen Special to the Los Angeles Times Tyler Perry right as Madea with Romeo Miller left and Eugene Levy in... (KC Bailey / Lionsgate )Supposedly a bid for a summer-months crossover hit ""Tyler PerrysMadeas Witness Protection"" is a spectacularly slapdash and wearingly half-hearted effort from the prolific writer-director-actor lacking energy structure or common sense.Perry returns to his signature character of Madea a the sassy say-anything elderly aunt with a penchant for handguns and stern moralizing a who here is tasked with sheltering the family of accountant George Needleman (Eugene Levy) who is caught up in the federal investigation of a Ponzi scheme.Perry has said the idea for the film came from a dinner-table conversation about what might happen if Bernie Madoff was under house arrest with Madea but the setup is undermined by Perrys decision to make Levys character a hapless fall guy who was not in on any wrong-doing.And though ""Witness Protection"" is being sold partly on the premise that Madea goes to New York City this occupies only a few minutes of the Georgia-set (and shot) story. A long sequence of Madea going through airport security feels like the equivalent of a stand-up comedian pandering to an audience with jokes along the lines of ""Airports am I right?""Equally problematic the witness protection storyline a that Levys family is being hunted by a mob family named Malone a is ultimately abandoned. And why are prosecutors in Atlanta pursuing a Wall Street case and a New York crime syndicate anyway?With an accountant named Needleman and a banker named Goldberg one might assume the film would explore relations between African Americans and Jews but that subject is apparently too potentially fraught for Perry.The films general sloppiness is a sign that Perrys hectic production schedule a his previous film ""Tyler Perrys Good Deeds"" was released just this past February a may simply have gotten the better of him.Tom Arnold appears early on as Levys crooked boss and then never returns for his comeuppance. Marla Gibbs is likewise disappeared from the story. An implication that one of Perrys recurring characters is actually Levys biological father is left unresolved readdressed only briefly in the films end-credit outtakes. (Jokes from the trailer appear only in the final gag reel as well.)For anyone entering the filmmakers comedic world for the first time ""Witness Protection"" would make a terrible introduction.

In Witness Protection Madeas wisdom is applied to no less a matter than the global financial crisis. CPO George Needleman (Eugene Levy) is greeted at the office one day by the sound of shredding documents and the news that he has been made the fall guy in a giant Ponzi scheme with Mob ties. Taken into custody by the FBI patsy George and his already imploding family are brought down to Atlanta by one Agent Simmons (Perry) where the white folks are conspicuously housed with Simmonss Aunt Madea (Perry) and father Joe (guess who?). A pleasingly heedless use of extravagant narrative contrivances teaches a lesson in miscegenation--were all family in America--and offers George an opportunity for redemption at a Sunday service. An agent of spiritual regeneration and showman Perrys dramaturgy is as subtle as a Bible-thump but until a logy last act that has Levy disguised as a faux-Frenchman his instincts are on-target here.Film Details Tyler Perrys Madeas Witness Protection RatingPG-13 GenreComedy Running Time114 More Info Trailer Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Nick Pinkerton Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Since 2005s Diary Of A Mad Black Woman brought Tyler Perrys popular stage plays into the feature realm Tyler Perry has been turning out movies with Takashi Miike-esque speed. But the secret is that Perry never really changes. When youve struck oil why move the well? Yet Perry still makes the weirdest movies in the business with a tone lurching between broader-than-broad cross-dressing comedy and equally hyperbolic Christian morality plays. It doesnt stop there. For his latest Madeas Witness Protection Perry casts Denise Richards as Eugene Levys spouse letting audiences assume shes a vicious gold-digging trophy wife. But by defying expectations and making Richards a good partner Perry suggests the far stranger scenario that Levy and Richards overcoming a 24-year age difference met fell in love and may well resume their vigorous sex lives when their legal troubles are over. Yet their romantic pairing makes about as much sense as the rest of Madeas Witness Protection which finally brings Perrys Madea character wholly into Big Mommas House territory with a plot that has her protecting people from the mob. Levy plays a corporate executive set up as the fall guy for a Ponzi scheme that bilked various charity organizations out of their investment money while doubling as a money-laundering service for a crime family. The FBI offers Levy a chance to avoid jail by cooperating in a case against the mob but he Richards and their family--including two children and Levys dementia-addled mother (Doris Roberts)--need protection until after the trial. For that the agent calls on his aunt the loveable bruiser Madea to take in the family and fend off any pesky gangsters. (Another weird thing about the movie Not a single one shows up.) Staying mostly on the comedy side of the equation Madeas Witness Protection leans on Madeas usual brassy monologues which fuse no-nonsense belligerence with a grandmotherly wisdom that keeps her flock in line. Yet the plotting goes pleasantly far afield at times for instance by having Levy and Madea go incognito as respectively a beret-wearing Frenchman with a burgundy suit and curly mustache and an extravagantly wealthy member of the Jackson Family. There arent many laughs in this vaudevillian gambit and fewer still in the fish-out-of-water comedy of Madea hosting a rich white family thats chiefly concerned with yoga wi-fi and their carb intakes. Still Perry remains a true outsider artist--nobody makes movies like his. (And please dont try.)

Behold the slippery slope that has brought us from the best one so far last years ""Madeas Big Happy Family"" to the very worst ""Madeas Witness Protection."" Despite his love of possessory credits Tyler Perry is not what one might call the most disciplined filmmaker working today. But even by his standards this is a slipshod lazy and seemingly thrown-together piece of work. It wastes the talents of not just Eugene Levy and Doris Roberts but of Perry himself whose cross-dressing creation Madea has often been the saving comedic grace of Perrys films. The Atlanta-based auteur has gone on record saying that because Madea has become so popular with young viewers that he has toned her down -- no more weed-smoking or gun-toting. But here shes been rendered so inert that she goes from outrageous to by the end of the movies seemingly interminable running time fairly annoying and repetitive. Worst of all shes still the best thing this film has to offer. Levy stars as George Needleman a nebbishy accountant who discovers that hes been the patsy for a corporation thats been running a Ponzi scheme and laundering money for organized crime. To testify against his former employers and against the mob he and his family have to go into hiding so lawyer Brian (Perry) -- whos either a district attorney or a federal one (the movies never quite clear) -- brings the Needlemans to Atlanta to camp out with Brians aged father Joe (Perry) and aunt Madea (Perry). Also read Alex Cross Trailer Watch Tyler Perry on Matthew Foxs Trail (Video) If you thought the business talk in Perrys ""Good Deeds"" was maddeningly vague just wait until Brian and George push a bunch of papers back and forth and exchange gibberish about Swiss bank accounts and wire transfers. While George tries to unravel his boss chicanery Madea and Joe dispense life lessons to Georges young second wife Kate (Denise Richards) and their children (Danielle Campbell and Devan Leos). Georges bratty argumentative daughter is exactly the kind of character that Madea would have traditionally smacked around and berated until she learned to respect her elders. But whether its because of the kinder gentler Madea or because Perry was uncomfortable having the character exercise her violent shtick on white characters Madea instead fixes this snotty teen over the course of one conversation where the old lady even keeps her hands hidden under the table. For a movie about witness protection youd think thered be the teensiest amount of tension regarding George and his family being discovered by the bad guys but Perry clearly isnt interested. So we get a bunch of white suburbanites hiding out in what were told repeatedly is an all-black neighborhood and no one seems to notice not even nosey neighbor Marla Gibbs who is introduced in one scene only to disappear for the rest of the movie. Gibbs character is only one of many plot threads to be raised and discarded over the course of the film -- theres a go-nowhere joke about Joe and Georges mother (Roberts) having had a fling decades earlier -- and if the ""hilarious"" outtakes over the closing credits are any indication there was apparently a huge amount of improvisation going on during shooting. Many excellent films have been made that way but Perry never structures things enough here so that we get any kind of character payoffs or interesting plot. Ultimately whether written in advance or made up on the spot what we get on screen is sorely lacking in laughs. The midnight audience (with the exception of his would-be Oscar-bait ""For Colored Girls"" Perry refuses to pre-screen his films for critics) got some of the evenings biggest laughs at the ""Alex Cross"" trailer. If Perry winds up not cutting it as an action star heres hoping he can get the formerly funny Madeas groove back. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

TWITTER The franchises seventh installment features Eugene Levy the fall guy in a Bernie Madoff-style Ponzi scheme whose family is sent into hiding with the oversized matriarch. Madea is starting to look a little tired. No wonder considering that shes now starring in her seventh film iteration for her alter ego the alarmingly prolific actor-filmmaker Tyler Perry. But in the (as usual) self-branding titled Tyler Perrys Madeas Witness Protection this prototypical angry black woman seems content to merely roll her eyes or mutter to herself as commit physical mayhem. PHOTOS Teflon Actor Awards 6 Stars Immune to Bad Reviews Primarily notable for its adding numerous Caucasian characters into the mix this tired installment of the ongoing Madea saga has her playing nursemaid to a white family headed by a CFO of a Wall Street investment bank who has been set up as the fall guy for a Bernie Madoff-style Ponzi scheme. The hapless George Needleman (Eugene Levy) is in danger of being rubbed out for his cooperation with the authorities so federal agent Brian (Perry playing it straight) decides to squirrel him and his family away in what he laughably sees as the most inconspicuous place possible -- the Atlanta home of his irascible Aunt Madea (also Perry) and his crotchety father Brian (Perry yet again) in an all-black neighborhood. Needless to say culture clash ensues with the uptight family -- including Georges trophy wife (Denise Richards) his spoiled teen children (Danielle Campbell Devan Leos) and his dementia-addled mother (Doris Roberts in a fright wig) -- quickly set straight by their no-nonsense hostess. Other than an early scene in which Madea violently takes an armed carjacker to task the oversized matron is largely restrained this time around. Her principal foil is the rebellious daughter whom she not-so-hilariously teaches a life lesson by falsely telling her that her family has been killed. PHOTOS NAACP Awards Red Carpet Maintaining a consistent tone has never been one of the filmmakers strengths but this effort -- veering wildly from broad comedy to sensitive drama -- feels even more ungainly than most. And as usual the proceedings are interminably stretched out in this case to a snail-paced 114 minutes. Even such potentially amusing comic set pieces as when Madea goes through airport security with predictably chaotic results feel awfully half-hearted. Still any criticism seems useless as Perrys loyal legions of fans likely will eat it all up. Others will enjoy the antics of the ever-reliable Levy -- who spends most of the film in a state of amusing semi-hysteria -- and the presence of such familiar faces as Roberts John Amos and Tom Arnold. Speaking of familiar faces another one shows up in the obligatory end-credits outtakes. The surprise wont be spoiled here other than to say that he doesnt appear to be ""winning.""

Photo Tyler Perry as Madea in ""Tyler Perrys Madeas Witness Protection."" Credit KC Bailey/Lionsgate A prosecutor (Mr. Perry) needs a safe place to stash George while he turns him into a star witness so he sends George and his family to live with his Aunt Madea.Madea alas doesnt seem as if her heart were in this one letting a lot of opportunities to tear into something go by.For instance George has a disrespectful daughter (Danielle Campbell) who would benefit from a Madea beat down but when it comes its uncharacteristically tame. And when Mr. Perry finds an excuse to send Madea through airport security her reaction to the intrusiveness is tamer than what youd see in an average real-life airport screening. This time around the old gal just seems to be mailing it in.""Tyler Perrys Madeas Witness Protection"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for suggestive and occasionally salty language.
