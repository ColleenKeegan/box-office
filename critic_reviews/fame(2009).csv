Comments (1) click to enlarge Fame Free Rated PG  107 minutes  2009 This slick remake of Alan Parkers 1980 musical follows a diverse group of teens through four years at LaGuardia Arts the famous performing arts high school in Manhattan. Director Kevin Tancharoen once a choreographer for Madonna and Jennifer Lopez knows how to showcase dancers but few of his young actors transcend their stereotypical roles (only Collins Pennie as a Harlem rapper and Naturi Naughton as a pianist and emerging singer register any real emotions).The high school is so sanitized that there are no drugs cutthroat competition or--inconceivably for a theatrical milieu--no gay students.

A similar constitution is required to endure the misery pileup in Alejandro Chomskis film about saucer-eyed abused teenage runaway Maggie (Angela Sarafyan) who roams the streets of Los Angeles quickly finding kind protectors in David (Jesse Garcia) an illegal immigrant from El Salvador who tries to teach her the right way to love and Esther (Bai Ling) a stripper who instructs her new charge to recite the Post-it affirmations that adorn her dressing room (""All things are possible for the ones who believe""). Based on the play Jersey City by Wendy Hammond who co-wrote the screenplay with Deborah Calla A Beautiful Life dispenses with continuity and credibility (when your career as a pot dealer is thwarted try selling handmade beaded jewelry) to become the latest risible City of Angels-set sudser about broken souls and crossed paths destined for the trash heap. Scream smash slap cry repeat. The only respite fleeting scenes of Debi Mazar as a librarian rocking a cardigan and reading glasses. (Sunset 5) (Melissa Anderson) A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - BRIEF INTERVIEWS WITH HIDEOUS MEN ""Everything I write ends up being about loneliness"" said the late writer David Foster Wallace in a 1999 interview. Wallace was trying to get at the core of his Brief Interviews With Hideous Men a four-part short story he wrote as a series of monologues which in turn are presented as a transcription of interviews that an unnamed woman conducted with dozens of men. In a dizzying whirl of language Wallaces fictional men explain how they feel about the women theyve loved or more often than not have failed to love. Actor John Krasinski deeply affected by Wallaces work has been developing the stories as a feature for years. All of which makes it even more painful to say that as a film Brief Interviews With Hideous Men is a disaster. Wallaces monologues are funny profane intense and at all times deeply emotional. The plot specifics of each mans story -- the who what and where -- are secondary to the clutter of language. Wallace used language as a kind of protective padding for his interviewees and the reader at his own pace must dig deep to find the essential truths. Filmmakers even great ones are always battling the clock a dilemma that left Krasinski little choice but to cut each monologue down to its bone. The stilted storytelling that results often rings false and the monologues -- delivered by some very good actors (Timothy Hutton Bobby Cannavale) who come across as first-year theater students -- no longer add up to much. (Sunset 5) (Chuck Wilson)GO  IN SEARCH OF BEETHOVEN In Search of Beethoven plays like a good if necessarily condensed critical biography. Drawing from archival letters interviews with contemporary musicians and historians and a generous selection of live music Phil Grabskys film takes us through the life and work of its imposing subject moving from Beethovens days as the ""piano virtuoso of Vienna"" in the 1790s through his establishment as that citys leading composer and his subsequent personal troubles and declining production. Whats interesting about the film is not so much its re-creation of the mans life or its presentation of his character -- which hew closely to romantic notions of the stubborn increasingly erratic genius -- but its consideration of just how revolutionary his body of music was compared to that of his predecessors. The films real resource is its impressive array of talking heads their intimate familiarity with the music and their ability to impart graspable insight as when two subjects offer different readings of the Ninth Symphonys seemingly incongruous ending. Only the angry outburst of one expert who uses Beethovens genius to deride contemporary art and ""video clips"" as comparative trash imparts a sour elitist whiff to the proceedings. (Music Hall) (Andrew Schenker)THE INVENTION OF LYING The Invention of Lyings plot hook sounds like a pileup of Jim Carrey-Tom Shadyac concept comedies. Ricky Gervais fuzzy parable exists in an alternate universe where nobody has made a word for ""truth"" because nobody tells anything but -- until one man discovers how to say ""things that arent."" That man is The Offices auteur also co-writer/co-director here. As in that calling-card work Lying is interested in self-deception as a survival technique. Basically a good sort Gervais Mark uses his gift to ameliorate the sting of the matter-of-fact on the meek -- nobody here has heard the old ""Everythings going to be all right"" before and its a revelation. In a moment of unction Mark improvises the comforting idea of heaven along with a Man in the Sky making up the guest list. Playing to a more credulous public than Jesus he doesnt need miracles and the viral spread of TV news makes him an overnight prophet. At times it feels as if Gervais has made a film as two-dimensional in its smug secularism as Bruce Almighty was in its vacation Bible-school pandering. When the jokes based on universal social ineptitude wear with use the film remembers unrequited love. Gervais plays schlub beautifully testing and discarding a dozen ineffective inflections sweetly suppliant in hurt. But though Lying brushes more big ideas than commonplace comedies it hasnt taken those ideas through enough drafts to work out their implications or -- harder still -- make them killingly funny.

Gone are Leroys cornrows short shorts and leg warmers The anodyne adolescents in 25-year-old Kevin Tancharoens directorial debut (written by Allison Burnett) suggest not the charismatic street-smart pupils at Performing Arts but the Up With People squares. Dont you know who I am? Like all good drama queens the students in Alan Parkers 1980 original which unfolded during an unmistakably Koch-era New York took up space (blocking traffic on West 46th Street) and disrespected authority (dropping f-bombs in class smashing school property). They also did drugs had sex (and abortions if necessary) and stayed up past midnight. The new class at P.A. is strictly PG sharing a chummy coffee with the vocal instructor (Megan Mullally) who takes them on a karaoke field trip to Lucky Chengs where not one drag queen is visible. Light up the sky like a flame. Though his gayness was awkwardly shoehorned in carrot-topped Montgomery was at least undeniably out in Parkers film. His closest analogue -- many of the kids in the remake are race and/or gender inversions of the original characters -- merely alludes to homo leanings through emo Efronesque bangs and a slightly swish carriage. Members of the class of 80 struggled to stay in school despite homelessness and crime; the greatest crisis in 09 finds a students Sesame Street work schedule affecting her GPA. The sanitized moppets in the new Fame sing the body generic. (Citywide) (Melissa Anderson)MORE THAN A GAME More Than a Game follows Akrons Fab Four (later Five) kids on the basketball court from their ""Shooting Stars"" traveling youth team into high school and a run of championships. The reason this documentary tells their story -- instead of that of the team that miraculously upsets the by-then-nationally-recognized starters in junior-year playoffs -- is because one of the Fab was LeBron James. Ignored in the films discussion of LeBrons transition to premature fame is his attempt to swing early NBA eligibility after the loss which wouldnt jive with the ""all for one"" ethic among the films many pep-talk lessons. The ostensible director here is Kristopher Belman an Akronite who played court videographer to King James St. Vincent-St. Mary team but final cut belongs to LeBron Inc. The recent PR flub of Nike henchmen confiscating footage of James getting gently dunked on in a pickup game testifies to the powerful trust authoring James legacy. The film could be a tie-in to the recent ghostwritten autobiography Shooting Stars. Most obtrusive though is the contribution of Harvey Mason Jr. producing and soundtracking who sets Game adrift on an endless sea of crashing crescendos. Good game footage a few clear looks at the kids behind it but mostly as processed as Space Jam. (ArcLight Hollywood; The Grove; The Landmark; The Bridge; AMC Magic Johnson Crenshaw 15) (Nick Pinkerton)PANDORUM Despite too many cheap sound-cue scares and a slow-boil plot that veers between tension and tedium Pandorum -- a dead-serious horror/sci-fi pastiche that unimaginatively borrows from everything from Alien to WALL-E -- gets sort of interesting. Flight engineers Corporal Bower (Ben Foster) and Colonel Payton (Dennis Quaid) awake from a years-long ""hypersleep"" aboard the Elysium a massive spacecraft launched from the increasingly uninhabitable planet Earth in 2174. With no memory of their mission they find themselves in an abandoned wing of the craft a predicament they discuss at great and scintillating length (""Its cold in here"" Payton declares. ""Its fucking dark in here"" Bower retorts.) Eventually Bower ventures out to get the 411 encountering mummified corpses of his fellow crew members and then the gooey writhing mutants marauding through the craft in search of human flesh. A team slowly materializes out of the terrorized survivors Bower meets on his way to try and reset the craft on its course to Tanis an Earth-like planet. Much slimy mutant battle ensues. Director Christian Alvart clearly attended horrors new paint-shaker school of direction (motto shaky = scary) but the scripts twisty end-of-the-world intrigue saves this otherwise leaden film from total self-destruction. (Citywide) (Michelle Orange)GO  PARANORMAL ACTIVITY For Katie (Katie Featherston) a San Diego college student things have been going bump in the night since she was 8 years old and a ghost attached itself to her. The unseen being that has been benignly haunting her for years thrills Katies loving but skeptical boyfriend Micah (Micah Sloat) who sets up a video camera to capture any supernatural goings-on. For his debut feature reportedly shot in seven days at a cost of 15 grand writer-director Oren Peli works wonders with stationary camera footage of the sleeping couple The bedroom door moves slightly; lights in the hallway go on and off; a shadow passes the bed. As the nights go by the presence seemingly annoyed at being recorded begins upping the ante and soon it appears that poor Katie is on the verge of channeling her inner Linda Blair. Grounded by strong performances by newcomers Featherston and Sloat who pretty much have the movie to themselves Paranormal Activity which demands to be seen in a crowded theater is refreshingly blood-free -- the fact that its old-school scares caused seemingly jaded 20-somethings at a recent midnight screening to squirm in their seats suggests that theres hope for the world after all. (ArcLight Hollywood) (Chuck Wilson) THE PROVIDENCE EFFECT Tucked in the closing credits for Rollin Binzers documentary The Providence Effect is a line noting that all proceeds from the film will be donated to Providence St. Mel the school that the film celebrates -- which might explain why so much of it plays like an infomercial. Located on Chicagos East side in the midst of a drug- and gang-infested neighborhood Providence is one of the best performing schools in the country thanks to what we are told is the revolutionary approach to education set in place by the schools founder and president Paul J. Adams III a former civil rights activist who has made education his battlefield. The first half of Providence is filled with platitudes and the repetition of buzzwords like ""poverty"" and ""achievement"" but nothing that explains Adams policy in nuts-and-bolts terms. Just past the halfway mark though the camera follows the school principal on her daily rounds and we finally see what all the fuss is about a robust music program teachers given the freedom to innovate their approach and school initiatives that send students around the world for study. The film never completely shakes the feel of being more an advertisement than a documentary but once it settles into a concrete illustration of Adams philosophy (""Youve got to believe and expect that the children can achieve"") it becomes riveting. (Monica 4-Plex; AMC Magic Johnson Crenshaw 15) (Ernest Hardy)GO  RASHOMON Akira Kurosawas ritualistic exotic philosophical action flick effectively invented Japanese cinema for non-Japanese filmgoers despite the movies global-village synthesis. A samurai crime story with an investigative Citizen Kane flashback structure Rashomon is a mesmerizing play on the mechanisms of fiction which not only contributed a concept to courtroom journalism but counts among its descendents movies as varied as JFK and The Usual Suspects. Presented in a new 35mm restoration produced by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. (Nuart) (J. Hoberman)A SERIOUS MAN The shtetl shtick that opens Joel and Ethan Coens new movie -- Jewish peasant stumbles on an old Hasid who may or may not be a Dybbuk -- tips its hat to the great existential comedy that A Serious Man might have become if it wasnt buried beneath an avalanche of Ugly Jew iconography. Set in 1967 in a Midwestern Jewish neighborhood like the one the Coens grew up in A Serious Man is crowded with fat Jews aggressive Jews passive-aggressive Jews traitor Jews loser Jews shyster Jews emo-Jews Jews who slurp their chicken soup and -- passing as sages -- a clutch of yellow-toothed know-nothing rabbis. At their center is the beleaguered academic Larry Gopnik (played by the excellent stage actor Michael Stuhlbarg) a decent geek clinging desperately to his rapidly shredding status quo as his family and his job threaten to fall apart. By way of plot Larry suffers buckets of abuse from this crew then seeks spiritual guidance where none is forthcoming until either by accident or grand design his life seems to get better all by itself. If this were it the movie would be no more than another dreary exercise in Coen Brothers sadism. But the visual impact of all these warty unappetizing Jews carries A Serious Man into the realm of the truly vicious -- and God help the rube who cant take the joke.

(ArcLight Hollywood The Landmark) (Ella Taylor)GO  SURROGATES A montage of news footage crisply introduces the not-too-distant future where the worlds white-collar professionals live vicariously through plastic-smooth swimsuit-cut surrogate bodies psychically remote-controlled by flesh-and-blood selves abandoned to storage and pallid vegetation. These superdurable avatars are free to live in (somewhat timidly imagined) consequence-free hedonism. No real victims means no crimes hence not much work for our FBI agent (Bruce Willis) until an unheard-of murder draws him to the ghettos of the offline human minority. As he investigates director Jonathan Mostow takes the tired anti-authoritarian formula of dreadlocked granola resistance against well-equipped state thugs and knots it in noirish contortions. Surrogates are played by human actors with the slightest emotional attenuation recalling all-CGI movies that spend untold millions reinventing life. Willis is fine as both his blond action figure (Zack Morris hair) and his actual self in trusty bruised-palooka mode. Mostow does good meat-and-potatoes genre work coherent even when reckless -- which is why you probably dont know his name. His Internet-era smash-up Fahrenheit 451 comes in nice and lean with room for a couple of cherry action pieces -- that surrogate bodies can be guiltlessly plowed over liberates his car chase and Radha Mitchell does fine acrobatics in high heels. (Citywide) (Nick Pinkerton) WHIP IT Drew Barrymore making her directorial debut is blunt onscreen and off- about her inspirations for this tale of an anguished debutante-turned-roller grrrl Take a little bit of Peter Yates Breaking Away (a teen townie trying to escape his humdrum existence and dad on a 10-speed) toss in Adrian Lynes Foxes (bored suburban girls screwing and drinking to Boston and Donna Summer) and add John Hughes Pretty in Pink (good girl makes bad choice in boy) and a bit of George Roy Hills Slap Shot (sports violence as metaphor for outsiders struggle). The only thing that keeps Barrymores effort from playing like an American Movie Classics rerun is the soundtrack an alterna-rock all-skate to which Junos Ellen Page goes round and round an Austin Texas roller-derby rink during her rather sudden rise from klutz-on-wheels to girl-power poster child. Pages beauty queen Bliss Cavendar is ultimately the least interesting character in the film -- a more-good-than-bad youth in revolt clashing with an overbearing but well-meaning Mom (Marcia Gay Harden) a sweet but disinterested Dad (Breaking Aways Daniel Stern) the best friend with big plans (Alia Shawkat) and the mopey-dopey indie rocker who fucks her over (Landon Pigg a singer-songwriter making his um acting debut). Highlights Andrew Wilson as the roller girls coach (ah so theres the Wilson brother who can act) and the roller-derby vets (played especially well by Juliette Lewis and Kristen Wiig) about whom we learn just enough to wish the movie was focused on them instead. (Citywide) (Robert Wilonsky)ZOMBIELAND The zombie movie -- that evergreen vessel for all manner of social and political allegory -- gets stripped down to its ""Holy shit Zombies Run"" chassis in this fitfully amusing romp directed with little ambition and even less distinction by first-timer Ruben Fleischer. Set in a not-too-distant future (Roland Emmerichs apocalyptic 2012 due for release in November is on the marquee at Graumans Chinese) where most of mankind has gone flesh-eating crazy from a Mad Cow-style pandemic Zombieland follows the requisite hardy band of uninfected survivors as they like the Griswolds before them make their way to the promised land of a Southern California amusement park. Woody Harrelson leads the charge as a leathery urban roughneck in the Snake Plissken mold with Jesse Eisenberg (typecast yet again as a virginal neurotic) Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin (playing a couple of scam-artist sisters) riding shotgun. Ho-hum zombie mayhem lurks around every bend but the movies comic tone becomes increasingly strained (as does Eisenbergs logorrheic voice-over) up to and including an indulgent movie-star cameo by a certain deadpan genius usually more discerning in his choice of projects. Who ya gonna call? How about John Carpenter. (Citywide) (Scott Foundas) Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke? NEXT Contact LA Weekly Follow LA Weekly laweekly L.A.

Stephen Cole From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Thursday Sep. 24 2009 347PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 318PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Fame Directed by Kevin Tancharoen Written by Allison Burnett Starring Naturi Naughton Kay Panabaker Asher Book Paul Iacono Kherington Payne Debbie Allen Kelsey Grammer and Charles S. Dutton Classification PG Fame is being promoted as a remake of the 1980 film where to paraphrase its most famous song performing-arts students learned how to live forever. No they didnt turn into vampires. They became dancers actors musicians and singers - a brazen gang of tough and tender little showstoppers. Of course since then there have been so many young-adult theatrical movies and TV shows - Rent High School Musical (1-3) Garth Drabinskys recent Triple Sensation - that it feels like student shows have never really stopped. Even if youre weary of plucky little showstoppers you wont mind the first half hour of the Fame do-over. The youngsters are familiar types the kid from Iowa lost in New York an angry poet hiding from himself and a downy innocent who needs to have her goody two shoes scuffed a bit. Still theyre a talented bunch and director Kevin Tancharoen a former dancer indulges himself (and them) in a fast furious opening montage that allows the dozen or so cast members to sing dance and mess around. Its all choreographed but many of the numbers have the loose improvisational feel of a good jazz jam session. Or maybe a cast party where everyone lets down their hair. Perhaps the young performers are in such a good mood because theyre liberated from having to play straight-as-a-ruler teen melodrama. If so give them credit for not letting their disappointment show through the rest of the movie a wearying pile-up of conventional backstage dramas up to and including the scene where the kid who cant talk to her parents learns in her big production number to communicate with them in song. Particularly gruelling are the scenes where parents have the audacity to question their kids showbiz ambitions - scenes with italicized dialogue that invariably go like ""Who in the world told you that you were so special?"" ""You did Mom."" Theatrical revues end up being audition tapes for young would-be stars. And the new Fame serves up some interesting new faces. Kherington Payne a former contestant on So You Think You Can Dance kills in a couple of numbers. And surely some boy band can use a tenor like Asher Book who offers a lovely off-hand reading of the Gershwins cotton-candy ballad Someone to Watch Over Me . Showbiz tales are also good showcases for venerable warhorses. Maybe the best music performance here belongs to former Will and Grace co-star Megan Mullally who completes a likable turn as a voice teacher by burning down a karaoke house with Rodgers and Harts You Took Advantage of Me . Which brings us to the final complaint about Fame . Rodgers and Hart and the Gershwin brothers are hardly up-and-coming tunesmiths. There are six new songs in the remake but not one makes any impact or is likely to end up as the ring tone of 2010.

In fact this film makes even the most gaudy of Saturday night TV talent contests look like Dostoyevsky in comparison. Fame 2.0 ditches the shackles of character story realism surprise and logic to deliver a flavourless paste of a movie - one which offers a sample of student life in a tastefully shabby New York performing arts academy. Were introduced to a sprawling ensemble of jazz-handing go-getters - played largely by wide-eyed newcomers - in a flashy opening montage theres the insular hip-hop thesp who scowls and says shee-it a lot; theres the timorous emo waif who needs to come out of her shell; theres the classical pianist who discovers a talent for soul singing (much - for reasons unexplained - to the chagrin of her father); and theres the zany fast-talking film buff who whenever hes on screen you pray the filmmakers would have the good grace to kill off in a some kind of wacky prescription mix-up. The one big name here is Kelsey Grammer who dons his best tweed waistcoat as the world-weary classical music tutor charged with drumming the joys of Bach into a class of students weened on the Black Eyed Peas. With his omnipresent rictus grin and lacklustre dialogue delivery Grammer gives a performance that looks like hes just repeating the word pay cheque over and over in his head whenever hes on screen. The one sequence in the entire film that rings true is when a lantern-jawed hopeful is being told that he hasnt got what it takes to be a professional ballet dancer and may have to seek other employment while at the same time a troupe of lithe suspender-clad strumpets are trotting out a brassy pole-dancing routine. The irony you feel has been lost on the filmmakers.Indeed while the film is completely devoid of humour the thing that irritates the most is the its shameful attitude towards the classical arts. In this world you cant perform a piece on the cello unless it segues into heart-on-sleeve MOR pop. Nor can you recite Shakespeare unless someone is beat-boxing in the background. Theres also no sense of the genuine competitiveness in the showbiz industry. By the end it feels like one big light entertainment indoctrination video and if Id heard the words smile dream hope or success just one more time I might have been inclined to two-step right off a suspension bridge.

Photo FINANCIALLY ailing MGM calls its new edition of Alan Parkers classic 1980 movie ""Fame"" a ""reinvention."" I call it a desperate cynical -- and most likely unsuccessful -- attempt by a dying studio to stave off oblivion by jumping on the ""High School Musical"" bandwagon exploiting one of its legacy titles in ways that dishonor the original. Yes the new ""Fame"" is still set at the High School of Performing Arts and there are some Manhattan street scenes (interiors were shot in Los Angeles) though there apparently wasnt enough money to restage the famous dancing-on-taxicabs climax in Times Square. Like the original it follows a group of students from their auditions to (for most of them anyway) their graduation four years later. But the cowardly producers have banished the grit and darkness of Parkers original which conveyed life in a New York City where ghetto dwellers rubbed shoulders with the comfortably middle class in a way seen in few popular entertainments. In Christopher Gores original Oscar-nominated script students struggled with poverty unwanted pregnancy racism illiteracy and homosexuality in ways that earned the movie a well-deserved R rating. In pursuit of a PG-rating (primarily for underage drinking) the ""reinvention"" will have none of that. There are generic love stories (all strictly heterosexual rather surprisingly for a performing arts school in the 21st century) worries about grades and an aspiring filmmaker ripped off by shady producers. Oh and perhaps the lamest subway suicide attempt ever committed to celluloid. The most telling comparison is with one of the best-remembered episodes from the 1980 original in which one of the aspiring performers takes her clothes off for a pornographer. Nearly 30 years later this has been watered down to an apple-cheeked girl fighting off a pass during a phony video audition. Handicapped by exceedingly lame direction (the inauspicious feature debut of Kevin Tancharoen) a script (Alison Burnett) that resembles a failed TV pilot a nondescript score (Mark Isham) replacing the Oscar-winning original confused editing fuzzy cinematography vulgar choreography and eyeball-gougingly ugly costumes and sets it seems needlessly cruel to single out the young actors inadequate performances. The best of the lot is probably Naturi Naughton a Broadway veteran with a huge voice who makes an impression despite being trapped in a corny cliched subplot about her desire to escape her fathers ambitions for her to be a classical pianist. (What Dad hasnt watched ""American Idol""?) You know a ""Fame"" reworking is in real trouble when Naughton is nearly upstaged by Megan Mullally as a faculty member who knocks a Rodgers and Hart number out of the park. The staff also includes Bebe Neuwirth (whose best scene is sabotaged by clumsy cutaways) Charles S. Dutton a subdued Kelsey Grammer and the lone returnee from the original Debbie Allen whos been promoted from teacher to principal. ""Fame"" is the sole 2009 release from MGM which is in such bad shape it has fallen into the hands of its creditors. Hopefully theyll put this once-great studio which is not quite celebrating its 85th birthday out of its misery soon.

Id have been pleased if Fame the updated version of the 1980s hit movie about a New York high school for the performing arts that spawned the long-running television series had just been one long string of good bad and ugly auditions. Anything to prolong the pleasure of watching disapproval spread like an ink stain across the face of Lynn Kraft the dance teacher played by Bebe Neuwirth as she spies another inadequate jete. The movie opens with dozens of kids trying out for spots in the freshman class at Performing Arts (the real school it is based on is named Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music amp; Art and the Perfoming Arts but thats a mouthful). Because they are mostly unfamiliar faces we cant tell who is going to make it and its good fun trying to pick the winners -- although the boy who shimmied his hips through ""All That Jazz"" was robbed. The schools motto as delivered by Debbie Allen in the role of Principal Simms -- no word on what happened to Lydia Grant -- is dedication to the craft. ""We dont care about your head shot"" she admonishes the incoming freshmen. ""Or your dreams of being in OK magazine."" (See the Top 10 Teen Idols.) I appreciated Principal Simms laying down the law thereby letting us know that this Fame would be a direct descendant of the original rather than something more in tune with what the pursuit of youthful fame actually looks like in 2009 i.e. aspiring to be the next Miley Cyrus or playing the kind of miniature version of despicable grown-ups you see on Gossip Girl or worst of all starring in a reality show. The kids in this Fame are sexy cool smart and wholesome; they may mislead their parents into thinking they are dutifully honing their classical music skills rather than singing hip hop but theyre good kids. Moreover the talents theyre supposed to have match the skills they actually do have also in keeping with both 1980s versions of Fame. Take the schools best dancer Alice played by Kherington Payne who was a contestant on So You Think You Can Dance and has enormous slinky appeal. Youre just starting to see her as the perfect girl to cast in the remake of Flashdance (how far away can that be?) when you realize that Paynes acting talents stop with her smile. But she can sure dance. Marco played by Asher Book has the dopey grin of Andrew Shue and sings like a dream. Denise (Naturi Naughton a petite Jennifer Hudson type) is the classical pianist with the urge to sing -- when she does so the first time in the movie her eyes well up with tears and the preview audience burst into applause -- but her uptight parents want her to walk the straight and narrow. They by the way are referred to in the cast credits only as Denises Mother and Denises Father which is exactly the way you want parents dealt with in a movie like this. Other notables include Malik (Collins Pennie) who broods and sweet Jenny (Kay Panabaker) who looks as though she just wandered in from the set of a Jane Austen movie. Both of them are studying acting with Alvin Dowd (Charles S. Dutton) equal parts teddy bear and therapist. ""This is the theater Malik"" Mr. Dowd says interrupting a passionate monologue in which Malik is overacting even more than Pennie. ""Not the street."" Its such a cheesy line but Dutton delivers it gently enough that you want to run away to Manhattan and perch at his knee. As the avuncular piano teacher Joel Cranston Kelsey Grammer is just right he cocks his head and gives fond smiles to the good students and occasional exasperated lectures to the more challenging ones like Victor (Walter Perez) who thinks Bach is lame. More of a surprise is Megan Mullally who finally sheds her Will amp; Grace persona with the character of voice teacher Fran Rowan. In one of the most compelling scenes in the film she takes her kids out to sing karaoke wows them with her own skills and then tries to explain why she never ""made it."" Ms. Rowans self-confident shell falls away and you see the kids absorbing the fact that all the promise in the world can be worn down by the grind of just trying to be noticed. Its a nice dose of reality in a slick prettily photographed highly produced cinematic world. The movies main flaw is its brisk pacing which limits how much we engage with the cast. Parents always complain that their kids grow up too fast; well these kids are in and out of this four-year program in under two hours. Why not have more faith in what could have been a fresh franchise? Start this group off as freshmen and keep them that way for the duration of the film? Then youve got Fame 2 and maybe in Fame 3 wed get to see Frasier and Lilith reunite and bingo first-time feature director Kevin Tancharoen making his crossover from the world of choreography has a whole new career. As it is the years whip by far too quickly. ""Already?"" the woman behind me said plaintively when the words ""Sophomore Year"" flashed up on the screen. Thats the joy of this Fame. Like the old ones it convinces you that high school if not life should go on forever. See TIMEs Pictures of the Week.

Fame Without hard work? That wont fly | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesFame Without hard work? That wont flyThe abysmal failure of the hip-hop/ Rent/Stomp hybrid remake of Alan Parkers gritty 1980 hit Fame has less to do with a bad script and poor narrative skills than with a radical shift in understanding - thanks to the plethora of Idol -type TV shows in recent years - the realities of pursuing a life in the performing arts.Sure they can jump but students in the Fame remake also have an irritating sense of entitlement writes Greg Quill.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Greg QuillBooks ColumnistFri. Sept. 25 2009 (out of 4)Starring Naturi Naughton Asher Book Kay Panabaker Paul McGill Charles S. Dutton Kelsey Grammer Debbie Allen Bebe Neuwirth Megan Mullally. Directed by Kevin Tancharoen. 107 minutes. At major theatres. PGThe abysmal failure of the hip-hop/Rent/Stomp hybrid remake of Alan Parkers gritty 1980 hit Fame has less to do with a bad script and poor narrative skills than with a radical shift in understanding - thanks to the plethora of Idol-type TV shows in recent years - the realities of pursuing a life in the performing arts.The characters in Parkers movie coped with racism illiteracy poverty sexuality drugs and unwanted pregnancy during their four years of struggling to become top-notch musicians dancers actors and singers at New Yorks High School for the Performing Arts. But the kids in dancer/video director Kevin Tancharoens first feature are vapid and vain ciphers - character development is just one key element sacrificed for song-and-dance numbers that have nothing to do with what we see the students actually learning - who are imbued with an irritating sense of entitlement.Article Continued BelowSure they have problems. Classically trained pianist Denise (Naturi Naughton) has an overbearing father who refuses to let her indulge her passion for singing. Wannabe film maker Neil (Paul Iacono) loses 5000 of his butcher dads hard-earned cash to a scam artist producer. Singing/acting hopeful Jenny (Kay Panabaker) who displays no real talent at all during class almost becomes the co-star in a sex video when she takes a shortcut to land a part in a TV show.Pianist Victor (Walter Perez) learns a hard lesson when his girlfriend gifted dancer Alice (Kherington Payne) quits school and dumps him to join a top-notch dance company. Kevin (Paul McGill) goes into a suicidal funk when told hell make a better teacher than a dancer. Wannabe actor Malik (Collins Pennie) inhibited by anger over the death of his young sister gets to pout a lot.Though meaningful dollops of sage advice from teachers - stage veterans and TV sitcom/drama stars Charles Dutton Kelsey Grammer Bebe Neuwirth Megan Mullally and Debbie Allen (she played the dance instructor in the original Fame movie and starred in the subsequent TV series) - go uncomprehended by these dull students they nevertheless get to complete their education and to star in a killer graduation number that showcases their inexplicably well-developed talents and implies theyre all on their way to enviable fame.That fame seems assured to those who merely crave it - without sacrifice or spiritual and physical effort - emerges as the underlying message in this sanitized and unrewarding production. Simon Cowell has much to answer for.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Fame"" set in New York Citys public high school for the performing arts is as eager to please as an ingenue and as endearingly inept. The charming happy bouncy young cast members sing and dance their hearts out but fledgling director Kevin Tancharoen is really into smoke-filtered backlighting mildly erotic modern-dance writhing and snappy cinematography. The picture is fitfully effective but the story disappears in the editing bay. The movie has about as much heft as watching jesters and fire eaters at a village fair. This remake abandons the abrasive wised-up attitude of Alan Parkers 1980 original. Parker paid attention to the sweat suffering and sacrifice that precede a solo in the spotlight. Streamlined and sanitized for an era of shiny happy ""American Idol"" wish-fulfillment the 2009 ""Fame"" endorses the myth that a pinch of gumption and a couple of breaks are all thats needed to launch a performing career. Its a moldy sentimental view of show business. The notion that many people who make a living from fantasy are narcissistic screw-ups is scarcely hinted at. Next to this movie ""Hannah Montana"" looks like a backstage documentary. The film focuses on a dozen classmates -- musicians singers actors dancers -- honing their skills and hoping for the chance to one day make it to Broadway Carnegie Hall or Hollywood. Snippets from rehearsals and recitals make up about 60 percent of the film. The rest of the time we follow the kids taking refuge in friendship and romance and the underdeveloped characters never take flight. Kherington Payne a stunning young hoofer from ""So You Think You Can Dance"" is a jazz-movement dynamo. Put her in a standard teen-angst breakup scene however and she plods. The movie doesnt get started -- to the degree that it does get started -- until a handful of old TV stars arrive. ""Cheers"" co-stars Kelsey Grammer and Bebe Neuwirth cameo as demanding teachers. Grammer trots out his usual high-flown accent and pouty snobbish stare. Neuwirth a disciple of Bob Fosse is entirely credible as a steely dance instructor. She grinds the dreams of a would-be ballet star beneath her toe shoes with a cool steeliness that Lady Macbeth would admire. Also on hand is magnetic Charles S. Dutton as a drama teacher who dabbles in student psychotherapy and Megan Mullally playing a vocal coach standing in for all the women who got into what they once thought were glamorous occupations and find themselves faded and passe. The amateurish story trots out antique showbiz situations as if it had just thought of them. Theres the virtuous actress shocked to find herself pinned down on the casting couch the classical pianist whose parents oppose her aspirations as a pop singer the young doofus filmmaker who makes the rookie mistake of trusting a smiling producer. Two freshmen sing ""Someone to Watch Over Me"" to each other in class and guess what? They fall in love. FAME  out of 4 stars Rating PG for thematic material including teen drinking a sexual situation and language. Tancharoen does what he can to dress up the hopeless aiming for a visual romanticism that would pull us along. But he lacks what makes all the best performance-based movies come alive. ""Singin in the Rain"" ""All That Jazz"" and ""School of Rock"" had rock-solid characters we cared about. Without compelling personalities ""Fame"" has a good dance beat but no pulse.

ABOUT THE MOVIEFame  out of four Stars Asher Book Naturi Naughton Kay Panabaker Walter Perez  Kelsey Grammer Megan Mullally Charles Dutton Bebe NeuwirthDirector Kevin TancharoenDistributor MGMRating PG for thematic material including teen drinking a sexual situation and languageRunning time 1 hour 47 minutesOpens Friday nationwide WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY ""You have talent"" Kelsey Grammer playing a music teacher at New York City High School of Performing Arts says to incoming students. ""Now lets see what you can do with it."" Clearly the actors playing artsy students at the elite high school have talent. But the filmmakers behind this musical redux dont do much with those skills. THEN AND NOW Do you remember their names? Fame offers slick entertainment with some exuberance but its devoid of soul or heart. The 1980 original feature and the 1982 TV series were mostly musical soap opera. But the film rated R was grittier and focused on a broader range of aspirations and human struggles than this version. The remake features more polished performances and elaborate music and dance segments. But director Kevin Tancharoen puts more energy into showcasing the talent and on exuberant choreography and catchy tunes than on the challenges facing these students. The bland and predictable story seems almost incidental to the showbiz angle not unlike Disneys High School Musical movies. The musical numbers often are infectious as we follow select students through their four years. One particular musical sequence during a lunch break seems particularly preposterous even within the fantasy world of musicals as virtually the entire student body cant resist joining the jam session. Grammer plays the exacting music maestro Megan Mullally teaches singing Charles Dutton is an acting instructor and Bebe Neuwirth is the dance teacher. Debbie Allen who co-starred in the original has a small part as the school principal. Mullally has an extended scene belting out a song at a karaoke bar. It seems to exist only to remind students of the gritty reality that their dreams of stardom may not pan out. They might end up like Mullallys character teaching and nurturing the talents of others. Or worse teaching ballet at a dance school in Iowa as one of the students is consigned to do. But that is about as tough as the disappointments get. The luckiest ones get small parts on TV or a recording contract or a spot in a dance ensemble. Marco (Asher Book) is easygoing and grew up singing in his fathers Italian restaurant while Jenny (Kay Panabaker) is a more uptight fledgling actress. The two embark on a romance. Denise (Naturi Naughton) defies her strict parents who want her to be a concert pianist to pursue a career singing Ramp;B. Though the musical numbers are engaging the human stories are lacking. We get only a superficial sense of these students and a cursory idea about their development over the four years from auditions to Graduation Day.

""Fame"" Movie Review -- They are the girls who are wearing boas at 3. The tween boys who secretly lip-synch to CDs. The kids who direct the neighbors kids in backyard plays. If you are a parent of one you already know this. And I know what movie youre going to this weekend. ""Fame"" is a remake of the 1980 hit and its a pleasant undemanding entertainment for drama-club kids and the people who love them -- a family-friendly salute to young performing artists. Like the original picture it follows a group of students through their education at Manhattans LaGuardia High School of Music amp; Art and Performing Arts. And they all have their stories. Fame (PG) MGM (107 min.) Directed by Kevin Tancharoen. With Naturi Naughton Kherington Payne Bebe Neuwirth. Now playing in New Jersey. STEPHEN WHITTYS RATING TWO AND A HALF STARS Rating note The film contains underage drinking and mild language and sensuality. One is a classical pianist who yearns to sing hip-hop. Another is a ballet lover who cant quite make the grade. A long-legged dancer angry actor and budding music producer help fill out the ranks. In between crises they put on big production numbers. Its corny true but still several cuts above the mind-numbing ""High School Musical"" series. And its helped by an excellent cast particularly the vets playing the faculty -- including Debbie Allen from the first film now here as a principal and the always-wonderful Bebe Neuwirth as a no-nonsense dance teacher. The young performers are a bit more hit-or-miss. Kay Panabaker is far too wishy-washy as Jenny a naive young acting student; Paul Iacono is a trifle grating as Neil a would-be director. But Kherington Payne a former ""So You Think You Can Dance"" contestant has legs from here to the ceiling. And East Oranges own Naturi Naughton is so marvelous as a preppy pianist-turned-vocalist that audiences at a recent screening broke into applause after every number. Saeed Adyani East Orange native Naturi Naughton performs in a scene from ""Fame."" Remember that Naughtons last movie part was playing the very different Lil Kim in ""Notorious"" and you get an idea of how big her achievement is here. Can someone please give this young actress a big Broadway role? Now? Unfortunately the script by Allison Burnett (who already has ""Autumn in New York"" ""Resurrecting the Champ"" and ""Untraceable"" to answer for) is a little fuzzy on facts -- like fudging the curriculum and misplacing the school by more than 20 blocks. Worse its a little backward with the female characters. Its seen as a good thing when Jennys boyfriend forbids her to talk to another older boy (and when she does she not only gets groped -- see -- but has to beg forgiveness from that angry boyfriend twice). Another student a could-be hip-hop star turns down a major-label offer because it would hurt the feelings of the boys who produced her demo tape and whom the label doesnt want. Endorsing smarter more ambitious young females wouldnt be a bad thing. Neither would acknowledging that a school devoted to theater might actually have a few out-and-proud students (although yes there is that ""sensitive"" ballet lover). But then you wouldnt have that PG rating. Director Kevin Tancharoen making his debut at only 24 mostly papers over the problems and moves things along. Ironically hes bad at what he clearly thinks are his set pieces -- an early Halloween party and the concluding dance number seem to be made up of leftovers from Britneys ""Circus"" tour. (Yes Tancharoen used to work with Spears). But when he actually stops and lets Naughton sing an entire song or Payne do a routine the movie comes alive. And when Neuwirth (or Megan Mullally as a vocal coach or Kelsey Grammer as a music instructor) gets a juicy line or two things perk up even more. No this movies not going to ""live forever."" But for anyone with a budding Bernhardt or potential Pavlova in the family itll definitely last several years on repeated DVD rotation.

Photo Credit MGM 2009 advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Talented teens try to make it yet again at New Yorks arts high school. Rated PG BOTTOM LINE Stay home and watch real high-school creativity on Foxs ""Glee."" CAST Newcomers who play 14-18 but look 25 plus star cameos as teachers. LENGTH 147 The attempt to live forever may finally have stuck a stake in the ambition of ""Fame."" After Alan Parkers 1980 hit movie which won Oscars for the score and the gonna-live-forever title song the tale of hopeful kids at the New York High School of the Performing Arts has dwindled into an 80s TV series and at least three way-Off-Broadway touring shows. Now we have a big bland and bogus clone of a movie update which runs a half-hour less than the original and only feels like forever. The remake has the same general plot outline and the steadying presence of Bebe Neuwirth Megan Mullally Charles S. Dutton Kelsey Grammer and Debbie Allen as supportive faculty. advertisement | advertise on newsday But the kids look awfully mature for high school. And though there are halfhearted efforts to acknowledge the digital generation these are teens without sex drugs or more than a wink of gayness. All they care about is getting a recording contract getting a movie deal getting - you know - famous. Whatever the moviemakers care about it isnt what we used to define as reality. The set for the update is not the modern LaGuardia Performing Arts High School behind Lincoln Center. Instead they filmed in the old Times Square building that hasnt been used for performing arts since 1984 - and of course in L.A. The choreography is tarted-up and the new songs are mostly hip-hop generics. Most upsetting is the attitude toward the arts dismissed as prisons from which creative children must escape to find their real selves in pop. Now that the entire world is a talent contest the competition theme feels even more old and desperate than the kids.

Photo Saeed Adyani MGM Fame Song dance retooled for new generation 1 / 5 Back to Gallery Fame Musical. Starring Naturi Naughton Kelsey Grammer Bebe Neuwirth and Debbie Allen. Directed by Kevin Tancharoen. (PG. 107 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Years from now - no six months from now - when people talk about the movie ""Fame"" they wont be referring to the modern-day remake that opens today. ""Fame"" will remain the 1980 movie that spawned the hit song and the subsequent TV series. Yet there are good things about this remake that shouldnt be ignored. Like the original film this one tells the story of high school students at New Yorks School of Performing Arts a highly competitive trade school for performers that kids from all over New York City attend to become professional dancers actors and musicians. Its a place where either dreams are killed in the crib or start to become true where kids find out if they have what it takes - and ""having what it takes"" isnt always fair. Some are naturally gifted and things come easy to them. And some can work hard and never succeed. Much of the movie has a structureless documentary feeling to it which is good and should have been pushed further. The opening sequence shows the students auditioning. The auditions are rendered in brief snippets with a handheld camera and this time the handheld footage conveys the subjective excitement of a make-or-break event. This hyperreal documentary quality is combined with a borderline fantasy feeling which will probably drive some literal-minded viewers up the wall but which is actually the movies best element and its one claim to distinction. Theres a scene for example in which the students are all hanging out either in a lunchroom or a study room. Theyre all in their individual groups. And then one kid starts banging on a table. And another starts rapping. And then the horn players guitarists and come in. And then the violins get into it. Dancers leap up and all of a sudden we have - you guessed it - a supposedly impromptu highly polished production number. For those who need a psychological analogue to justify onscreen exuberance think of it this way The scene is not showing you a real event. Its showing you the way such an event might be recorded in youthful memory. Leave em wanting more But then just as that scene is about to take off completely and become even more glorious and wonderful the movie cuts to a mundane conversation between two students about what they really want out of life. OK fine. Thats the strategy of ""Fame"" at least in its first hour Leave the audience wanting more. Were shown little tantalizing classroom scenes with next-to-no follow-up A would-be actress who needs to loosen up physically a would-be actor who needs to loosen up emotionally and a would-be Nureyev who cant lift his partner to save his life. Debbie Allen who appeared in the 1980 ""Fame"" is back this time as the hard-as-nails principal. The teachers played by Charles Dutton (acting) Kelsey Grammer (music) and Bebe Neuwirth (ballet) lend the film gravity the sense of people who know all about performer aspiration and who are very conscious whenever theyre doling out encouragement or necessary pain. Particularly strong is Megan Mullally as the singing teacher whose blithe manner conceals her own professional disappointment. A ghastly finale The movie has two major flaws that come close to taking it down a notch. The first is that the kids arent terribly interesting possibly because 16- and 17-year-olds tend not to be all that interesting in real life except to each other. And the big musical finale - the students final project that in this loosely structured film stands in for a climax - is ghastly Bad song bad orchestration and bad choreography. But the singing ... the singing is good. Which leads us to Naturi Naughton the one star who might come out of ""Fame."" She has a voice that gives goose bumps and makes your hair stand up before you even have time to think ""Hey shes good."" Today is going to be a very busy day at her agents office. -- Advisory This is a fairly wholesome movie.

Why settle for this dull safe production -- at once airbrushed in plot and undisciplined in execution -- when you can watch Glee? The teachers (including original cast member Debbie Allen as school principal) turn out to be the best part of the show. The kids try hard but mostly look grim while pretending to smile.

Wright Screenwriter Allison Burnett / Christopher Gore We can trace the vacuous quest for fame of todays Paris Hiltons back to the original 1980s film called Fame but there is no comparing the talent and dedication required by the world of classic show biz with the empty preening of the talent-free 21st century wannabe. Fortunately the cast of Fame and all its imitators as well as this remake are super-gifted and brim with enough confidence and promise to carry you through the predictable narrative. But as a reinvention of the original you may be disappointed in director Kevin Tancharoens update. Theres an oddly retro feel to the film and a preponderance of rap and African-American diva vocals which smack of the 80s and 90s regurgitated. The most moving moments are definitely the singing performances with most of the acting set-pieces nowhere near as effective. As a masterclass for starry-eyed teenagers aspiring to enter a performing arts high school like New Yorks Julliard the film delivers. There is strong support from showbiz alumni Kelsey Grammer and Bebe Neuwirth but the dark side of so much ambition and talent is not delved into with enough depth to create a realistic picture of what it really takes to succeed -- the stamina of a superhero and the hide of a rhinoceros Facebook Twitter Delicious Reddit Digg what are these?

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Hogwarts has nothing on New Yorks High School Of Performing Arts. The idea of a school where hundreds of supremely talented intense kids are packed together to pursue any and every artistic discipline regardless of class race gender beliefs or background is practically magical. Its a guaranteed breeding ground for vast personal drama heavily imbued with the sense of boundless potential being recognized then either rewarded or rejected. The setting proved so richly successful in Alan Parkers 1980 movie musical Fame that it spawned a six-season spin-off TV series a series of records and performance tours a reality-TV competition and a stage musical. Its no wonder the idea is back via a 2009 remake helmed by first-timer Kevin Tancharoen. The big surprise is how much the remake respects the original. Like its predecessor the 2009 Fame is a scattershot series of portraits with no clear protagonist. The film breaks up into five sections first 10000 teenagers audition to fill 200 slots at ""P.A."" as they call the school and then the film checks in with them briefly over each of the four years til graduation. Their personal stories are naked cliches pianist Naturi Naughton suffers under her fathers oppressive expectations actor/rapper Collins Pennie represses his deepest emotions dancer Paul McGill shares his peers desire but not their talent and so on. Each plot plays out via at most a couple of scenes of setup and one of resolution. Its like a full season of The Wire edited down to a brisk season recap. But by not wallowing in any of these stories Tancharoen and screenwriter Allison Burnett focus on the vivid emotions rather than the trite details. Thats a bit of a cheat but it works fine as a mere minor background to the joyous performances from a wild interdisciplinary cafeteria jam inspired by the first Fame to a strikingly dramatic Bob Fosse-esque dance piece to Naughtons heartbreaking cover of the first films Oscar-nominated hit ""Out Here On My Own."" (The only other musical reprise from the 1980 movie is Naughtons take on the title song.) The music leans more toward hip-hop and Ramp;B than in the original but theres still room for a soupcon of everything in Tancharoens world from ballet to tap to camcorder filmmaking to Chicago showtunes. The creators instincts only fail when they push too far in the direction of High School Musical with one too many pretty Zac Efron types and too much radio polish When singer Asher Book mic-and-music-free for his audition opens his mouth and produces a processed-to-the-max radio-ready ballad the moment is disingenuous artificial and cloying. But there are few such wrong moves in a film thats largely a raw uplifting love letter to creativity in every possible form.

"Fame | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; fame ) Fame (United States 2009) September 24 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli The 2009 version of Fame which represents the feature debut of director Kevin Tancharoen (who has a few TV credits to his name including the series ""Dancelife"" and was involved in a Britney Spears tour) uses the 1980 movie of the same name as its template. Its not a remake in the strictest sense of the word; although the storys progression follows the same format the characters are all different - only echoes of their predecessors remain. In keeping with modern cultures inexplicable affinity for musical variety shows this movie de-emphasizes the characters in order to devote more time to singing and dancing. As a result there are instances when it strays dangerously close to programs like American Idol and its dance compatriots. This is not necessarily a good thing; it results in a cheesy production with underdeveloped characters that feels more like a TV pilot than a self-contained motion picture. The 1980 Fame ended up spawning a successful TV show and the small-screen version is probably better remembered than the movie. Although Debbie Allens association with Fame began with the film in which she had a minor role she became synonymous with it during its years on television. Her involvement continues with the 2009 edition although her character has changed. Here she plays the schools principal. Irene Cara who is also heavily identified with Fame primarily because of her musical contributions was not involved in the remake. Two of the songs she sang are used - ""Out Here on My Own"" (with Naturi Naughton providing vocals) and the title track which is not employed until the closing credits. One of the key problems with the 1980 Fame which is exacerbated here is that there are too many characters and too long a time span for any story to achieve critical mass. Worsening the situation is that most of the individuals the screenplay focuses on are walking clichA(c)s and theres little opportunity for any of them to break free from their carefully plotted orbits. The setting is the same a competitive New York City arts high school. The framework is identical with the movie broken into five chapters ""Audition Day"" ""Freshman Year"" ""Sophomore Year"" ""Junior Year"" and ""Senior Year."" The individual stories are culled from the stereotyped teenager bargain bin of the script-writers convenience store. Theres the shy insecure girl whos trying to find herself; the angry rebel whos getting in touch with his inner artist; the classical pianist who defies her parents expectations when she starts singing hip-hop; the dancer who finds her dreams fulfilled; and the one who has his hopes dashed. In the skinny span of 100 minutes Fame covers four years in the lives of these people (and others) as they move from admission to graduation. Time is so compressed that most of the characters hardly seem to change (emotionally or physically) from year-to-year. And not since Grease have so many actors in their mid-20s been asked to play high school freshman. (At the tender age of 19 Kay Penabaker comes the closest to being credible.) Of the ""teenagers"" the only one who could be considered a standout is Naturi Naughton who has skill both as an actor and a singer. (She was recently featured as Lil Kim in Notorious.) Most of the other young performers appear to have been chosen more for their physicality than for their acting ability. Theyre good singers and dancers but even the best are merely adequate as thespians. Some of them are embarrassing. Not surprisingly (Naughton aside) the most credible performances come from the adults playing the teachers Kelsey Grammer (as the musical coach) Bebe Neuwirth (dancing) Megan Mullaly (singing) and Charles S. Dutton (acting). Of these four only Mullalys alter-ego has anything resembling a backstory and thats revealed in a clumsy five-minute scene that features her singing on karaoke night. Fame is a mash-up of disparate elements that dont blend well. Since it is dramatically inert due to its inability to develop even one character into a living breathing individual it relies almost solely on the musical elements to keep the audience involved. Its more successful in that regard than in its attempt to flesh-out a story but some of the production numbers are too ostentatious and are awkwardly shoehorned into the cinematic tapestry. (This was also true of the 1980 movie where the performance of ""Fame"" was included in a laughably absurd manner.) Some of the numbers like the lunchroom jam radiate an offbeat kinetic energy. Others like Naughtons powerful rendering of ""Out There on My Own"" evoke an emotional response. Most however are disposable and forgettable - candy for the eyes and ears that attempt to distract from the movies distressing inability to tell a coherent or compelling story. The original Fame had its share of problems but authenticity was not one of them. It felt real. The characters while mostly underdeveloped were believable.

Almost three decades since ""Fame"" -- a legacy that included a TV series a musical even a reality show -- the original template re-emerges again focusing on fresh-faced yet hungry kids at New Yorks High School for the Performing Arts. The real motivator here though is Disneys ""High School Musical"" franchise (and perhaps a dollop of ""American Idol"") resulting in a watered-down tone that causes the movie to drift dramatically between its musical and dance sequences. This PG-rated offering thus dances along a fine line -- one that suggests a shelf-life well short of its ""I wanna live forever"" anthem. Mostly ""Fame"" tries to galvanize a new generation while offering a bland reboot of the recipe to anyone old enough to remember it. Following only the broadest outline of Christopher Gores edgy original screenplay -- which captured the passion within these kids and how that can be exploited -- first-time director Kevin Tancharoen and writer Allison Burnett hew closer to ""after-school special"" territory in the drama. Yes theres a ravenous hunger for success and the occasional disappointment but the kids and their stories have been homogenized in such a way that nothing all that bad -- or good for that matter -- really happens to any of them. Opening with the auditions and then continuing year by year through the high school experience the movie is almost inescapably episodic which isnt necessarily a bad thing. Its only that the kids stories lack much bite and their caring teachers -- a virtual sitcom honor roll that includes Kelsey Grammer Megan Mullally Bebe Neuwirth and Charles S. Dutton (Debbie Allen provides the one link to the first movie) -- dont have enough screen time to make much of a difference. (The credits nevertheless have an egalitarian streak listing both the older and younger contingents alphabetically.) The sharp corners of issues such as ethnicity class and sexuality have been rounded leading to more mundane conflicts. Denise (Naturi Naughton perhaps the one breakout player here) yearns to sing but her parents insist she stick to classical piano. Jenny (Kay Panabaker) burns to bust out creating tension with her more laid-back but vocally gifted boyfriend Marco (Asher Book). And Malik (Collins Pennie) struggles to channel anger and pain from a personal loss into his acting and rapping. Alas these pieces however attractive dont add up to much dramatically. And even when they flirt with insights into the toil that goes into honing ones craft and the distance between talent and stardom they tend to pull up short -- such as a promising but finally unrealized moment in which first Jenny and then Marco sings Gershwins ""Someone to Watch Over Me."" A choreographer by training Tancharoen fares better in bringing an exuberance to the performance sequences but those frequent interludes -- the best being Naughton belting out a song from the original ""Out Here on My Own"" -- dont so much advance the story as provide a welcome respite from it. For MGM -- which could certainly use a hit on its thin release slate -- all this has the feel of a missed opportunity. Yes ""Fame"" was there in the library but this revival manages to feel like a ""me-too"" response to all the singing and dancing reality-based and otherwise bursting out all over primetime seeking to tap into the lucrative niche of teen and preteen girls. The irony is that several of these talented young performers might very well wind up becoming famous. It just likely wont be for this.

(Lakeshore Ent) Joe Neumaier Thursday September 24 2009 254 PM Title Fame Even 29 years after the first ""Fame"" movie the logo and setting are known to viewers too young to remember even the 1982 - 1987 TV series. But thats not what makes this amiable musical drama such a natural choice for a remake.The new movie filled with unknown soda-commercial-sweet faces is a fictional extension of the endless reality shows from ""American Idol"" on that showcase sweat and competition in pursuit of stardom. Yet built into the world of ""Fame"" -- and which can be seen as an antidote to those TV programs get-famous-fast mentality -- is the notion that success requires hard work and that not everyone will as the song goes light up the sky like a flame.The ones trying for it this time at the High School of the Performing Arts -- in a screenplay fashioned after the first movies though not actually filmed at Manhattans Fiorello H. LaGuardia high -- are Marco (Asher Brook) a singer and his soon-to-be-girlfriend Jenny (Kay Panabaker) a shy actress; Denise (Naturi Naughton) who switches from classical piano to singing helped by wannabe composer Victor (Walter Perez) and rapper-actor Malik (Collins Pennie); actress Joy (Anna Maria Perez De Tagle) dancer Alice (Kherington Payne) and filmmaker Neil (Paul Iacono).From first audition to graduation we see some get a taste of the real world and others find their true talent. Mixed in are performance sequences -- some enjoyable some not -- and a New York backdrop that may not be as intimidating as in 1980 but is still the perfect backdrop for all this striving.The grown-ups playing the faculty fit to a T as well Kelsey Grammer (music) Bebe Neuwirth (dance) Charles S. Dutton (drama) Megan Mullally (voice) with ""Fame"" vet Debbie Allen playing the school principal. Mullally has the most poignant moment admitting to her students that the reason she teaches is because fame for her just wasnt in the cards. (Stardom more than in the first film is golden here.)Whether the young ensemble attains it remains to be seen. The standouts though are Naughton Pennie and Perez De Tagle. Considering that none of the young stars of the original movie became big -- not even Irene Cara whose Oscar-winning still-catchy title song is remixed over a fun credits sequence -- they have nowhere to go but up.

But ""Fame"" devotes little time to developing characters.By Carrie Rickey Inquirer Movie CriticPosted September 25 2009Fame the 1980 musical about students at New York Citys High School for the Performing Arts surfaced in the era of A Chorus Line and boom boxes. Equal parts confessional aspirational and audition the film followed a handful of students who devoutly believed that performing is transforming. And they made us believe too.Fame the 2009 remake emerges in the era of American Idol and karaoke. As a demo reel showcasing seven promising young talents from their freshman through senior years its pleasant enough. As a movie dramatizing the talent and dedication required to make it the Fame reboot has fleet feet but lacks heart.The focus of Allison Burnetts choppy script is not the inspirational tale of how students turn self-doubt into self-expression but the cautionary one of how vulnerable performers get suckered by casting couch and predatory producers.So little time is devoted to developing characters that its hard to share their hopes and fears. They include Marco (Asher Book) the happy-go-lucky singer from Queens Jenny (Kay Panabaker) the timid actress from Long Island and Denise (Naturi Naughton) the classical pianist who longs to be a pop singer. Laidback Book and standout Naughton almost certainly will be seen and heard from again.The focus of director Kevin Tancharoen is on performances not performers. A dancer/choreographer/director who has worked with Britney Spears and the Pussycat Dolls Tancharoen exhibits little interest in his characters inner lives or milieu. (Mostly shot in Los Angeles the film lacks a New York flavor and rhythm.)Of the seven intersecting storylines only one that of Malik (Collins Pennie) an angry rapper/actor shows him retooling the emotional baggage weighing him down into wings that help him fly.From auditions where only one in 500 applicants is admitted to the freshman class through graduation the story hopscotches among classrooms anchored by Kelsey Grammer Megan Mullally and Bebe Neuwirth. Debbie Allen a dance instructor in the original has been promoted to principal.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Its not a good sign when the first few minutes of a movie about singing dancing rapping video-camera-wielding teenagers reminds you of a certain grimy horror franchise. But from the minute the camera drifts toward a series of light bulbs arrayed around a single word -- ""Fame done up in the iconic font of the 1980 film -- you could be forgiven for asking yourself how you wound up in a ""Saw movie. We hear only the imperative lyrics of the original movies title song (""Re-mem-ba Re-mem-ba Re-mem-ba) and the famous taunts made by Debbie Allen who played the dance instructor ""Right here is where you start paying in sweat. This is usually how the serial killer in ""Saw introduces his death games.Lives are spared in this sugarless new version of Alan Parkers movie and the TV show it spawned. But innocent songs and unsuspecting dance routines are hacked to bits. Like its predecessors (there was also a season of ""Fame L.A. and an NBC reality contest inspired by all of this) the 2009 edition is also set at the New York High School of Performing Arts or ""the P.A. where a clan of fresh young faces descend for four years of - well thats part of the problem.In Parkers movie and on the TV series we were handed a batch of talented New York kids with wild energy neon personalities and just enough self-belief for you to believe in them. And over the course of the school year and a television cycle we watched the schools staff hone skill into art. In the film especially you could see the work. You could see the skill. Parker really showcased them sometimes to ridiculous but memorable effect. I dont know what were supposed to admire about this new cast of enrollees. Theyre all camera-ready but mostly unremarkable. Written by Allison Bennett and directed as a music video by Kevin Tancharoen the movie sees something in them in that I cant.Were told that of the 10000 people who apply to P.A. only 200 are accepted. Frankly Id like to see the other 9800. Kay Panabaker who plays an uptight drama student named Jenny is nice and all but the object of a movie like this is to show us how four years of intensive training can turn this meek little girl into a great actor. Her stammering line delivery and timid demeanor promise only the next Neve Campbell. Forget P.A. Jennys attending the ""Party of Five Academy.Shes locked into a romantic story line with Marco (Asher Book) a squeaky-clean singing student with a strong Ralph Macchio haircut. His interest in her is baffling since shes dull and he seems just as likely to chase Neil (Paul Iacono) an aggravating acting student desperate to make movies or Kevin (Paul McGill) a dancer struggling to make an impression. The movie just isnt that interesting. The big surprise is meant to be that Denise (Naturi Naughton) the gifted pianist might be an even better singer of sappy ballads and hip-hop hooks. But having seen Naughton raunch it up as Lil Kim in last winters ""Notorious this more wholesome version of herself is underwhelming. Frankly one Ashanti is plenty. Denise defies her parents and teams up with a music classmate (Walter Perez) and rapper classmate (Collins Pennie) who is having trouble emoting in acting class (show me a rapper who doesnt?). The tune they create together sounds like a retro dance-house number. They debut it at a costume party which is about right since the song suggests that 2009 has clearly gone dressed as 1992. Does P.A. even offer a class in Camp;C Music Factory?A lot has changed in the three decades since ""Fame namely fame itself. The original kids really believed however naively in their talent that it would win out over everything. This time the students at P.A. seem entitled to success and with so many avenues to other peoples laptops or living rooms theres some truth in that. But the casting directors dont seem to appreciate that entitlement is not a means to entertainment. Its exasperating. Whenever Panabaker sings or Pennie raps I found myself longing for the blunt assessments of Simon Cowell.Allen makes a few appearances here as P.A.s principal and the electric feeling you got from ""Fame in the 1980s was seeing her and the other adults spot talent in these kids. Watching Gene Anthony Ray perform in the movie Allen looked like shed caught the vapors. I spent this movie searching for that awed reaction in the faces of the actors playing the teachers - Charles S. Dutton (drama) Megan Mullally (singing) Kelsey Grammar (classical music) and Bebe Neuwirth (dance). There are no teachers lounge discussions here. And I think its because theyd be brutal.What you really want though is a wow moment. And there isnt one. Theres no Susan Boyle or Jennifer Hudson or disarmingly fun number to be found amid all telegenic faces. Theres more to savor in any installment of ""High School Musical. No one here has any funk soul charisma or spontaneity. Its true that not many of the actors of the original movie and show became big names but ""Fame made them all seem like stars. Now the glorious threat of the title song seems like a joke. Im gonna live forever? Not this time.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2009 Globe Newspaper Company.

"Fame Movie review of Fame by Roger Moore - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Entertainment Entertainment Movie review Fame -- 2 out of 5 stars A scene from Fame MGM MGM Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Fame the original ""high school musical"" earns a sometimes toe-tapping remake that borrows scenes situations and character ""types"" from its 1980 original. But in filtering that gritty edgy drama about the true costs of pursuing a life in the performing arts through a Disney-fied HSM lens MGM has rubbed the edges off and scrubbed away all the grit. This Fame is a film without the guts to show Idolized America that as Debbie Allen so memorably said way back when ""Fame costs and right heres where you start paying.""Theres no hint of the first Fames struggles with substance abuse and sexuality struggles that included abortion. Even the darker themes repeated in this film -- eager talented and beautiful young people preyed upon by would be ""producers"" record execs and older acting peers -- are tidied up. OK fine. New York isnt the town it was back when Alan Parker was making his movie about the hyper-competitive New York High School for the Performing Arts. Times have changed interracial romance isnt a big deal nor is ""coming out."" But youd think if one was moved to include the stereotypical fey dancer and singer in the mix that youd differentiate yourself from the bland High School Musical by at least admitting that yeah some gay people go into the performing arts and theres no way you go to a performing arts high school without meeting them. A LOT of them.Heres what is perfect about this film from a guy who used to do Britney Spears videos (Kevin Tancharoen). The teachers were cast on the nose. Kelsey Grammer? Hed make a perfect music teacher pushing would-be hip-hop producer Victor (Walter Perez) to stop trying to jazz up the masters. ""The only thing of value you can bring to Bach is your respect.""The great Broadway singer/dancer Bebe Neuwirth (Grammers Cheers and Frasier co-star) is aptly cast as a dance teacher and Charles S. Dutton a great choice as the acting teacher trying to instill bravery and ""discipline"" in his colorless (Kay Panabaker) pupils. Megan Mullally tries to make the thin-voiced teens ""feel"" ""Someone to Watch Over Me"" and Debbie Allen has been promoted to principal presiding over this mob.""The cafeteria improv scene"" in which lunch turns into an anarchic jam session still thrills. But other scenes replicated dont come off at all.And the young actors are to a one dull. Naturi Naughton of Notorious is an underwritten pianist who really wants to sing Paul Iacano has the hat and the camcorder but little spark as the would-be filmmaker. Kherington Payne doesnt suggest the passion and focus of a dancer with ""tick off mommy and daddy"" issues. Collins Pennie makes an impression as the ""angry young black man"" who needs to learn theres more to acting than pouting. Fame gives us all four years of lessons learned careers begun and hopes dashed and thats just too much to cover with too many characters for this to gel. Quick sketches of characters quicker sketches of their homelife dont add to a complete portrait.And if youre going to censor this material in imitation of The Disney Channels greatest hit youd better fill in the holes with fun. Fame forgets that.I could totally see this cast of teachers starring in a new TV version of Fame. But if youre just trying to reprise High School Musical I dont think Id bother watching it.
