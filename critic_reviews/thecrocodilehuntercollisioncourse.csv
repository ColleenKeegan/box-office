Aussie daredevil conservationist Steve Irwin and his wife Terri work with all manner of wild animals. The Animal Planets most popular human star makes the transition to the bigscreen without having to act at all in ""Crocodile Hunter Collision Course"" a lightweight confection that delivers exactly what it promises. While primarily chasing down a rogue croc to move it out of harms way Aussie daredevil conservationist Steve Irwin and his wife Terri otherwise do what seems to come naturally -- working at close quarters with all manner of wild animals the more threatening looking the better -- while being pursued by some silly CIA agents who think theyre international spies. MGM has a perfectly respectable kid-friendly family offering here and all other things being equal should be able to launch it to decent theatrical returns before chomping down on a full meal in the home entertainment market. Having appeared over the past decade in an assortment of personalized wildlife TV docu series and specials notably ""The Crocodile Hunter"" ""Croc Files"" and ""The Crocodile Hunter Diaries"" the irrepressibly antic Irwin and his more even-keeled Yank mate are highly familiar to young tube viewers. Theres a relentless advocacy compulsion behind Irwins endeavors befitting the head of the Australia Zoo wildlife reserve which was founded by his parents that is amped up even further by what onscreen appear to be absolute tirelessness and fearlessness with a dash of corny humor thrown in for good measure. Far from being hidden the Irwins TV roots are freely brandished as their adventures are presented in standard screen size and with Irwin talking direct to camera docu style while surrounding action that does not involve the couple is shot more ""cinematically"" in widescreen (Irwin was reportedly never shown Holly Goldberg Sloans full script for the movie proper by first-time feature helmer John Stainton who directed all of the animal rescue heros TV shows -- better to let the blond and brawny bloke just be himself). Looking for some kind of frame that would permit the Irwins to go about their business without requiring them to interact with other thesps until the end Stainton and Sloan have come up with some nonsense about a U.S. satellite that crashes to Earth in Far North Queensland where the remaining metal capsule smaller than a football is promptly swallowed by an imposing 12-foot croc. Natch the object contains top-secret info on which the future of the world depends so the CIA dispatches two of its most bumbling and clueless agents Wheeler (Lachy Hulme) and Vaughan (Kenneth Ransom) to retrieve it. But the croc actually has much more to fear from the loony outsized rancher Brozzie (Magda Szubanski Mrs. Hoggett of the ""Babe"" films) whos got her shotgun ready if it dares open its mouth to consume another of her cows. The Irwins mission which they readily accept to rescue the croc and relocate it to a distant river where as Steve Irwin likes to put it the reptile wont have to ""come into conflict"" with humans. As they drive through the sparsely populated desert and jungle regions Steve and Terri come upon numerous animals they load onto their truck for ultimate delivery to their zoo -- a large lizard an intensely venomous snake a mate-eating fanged spider and even a baby kangaroo in need of mothering. Action highlight is Steve Irwins capture of the croc which involves him jumping on top of the critter straddling it like a wrestler and gradually with his wifes help getting a rope around its upper jaw before muzzling it with lots more cord (cutting it free is equally precarious). The CIA boys transition from hapless to ludicrous as events progress and even the truculent Brozzie is pacified by the Irwins steamroller passion for all things wild and scary looking. Irwins over-the-top personality accentuated by his broad Aussie accent at first seems to threaten a human volcanic eruption so hyperenthused is he for his cause and what he does. But the uniqueness of his self-appointed role in life and the unquestionable sincerity and enthusiasm that he brings to it ultimately prove winning. Terri who before meeting Steve started an animal rehab center called Cougar Country in her native Oregon comfortably pulls her weight in their joint endeavors but without the manic gung-ho showmanship of her hubbie. Szubanski has fun laying on the old cowgirls cantankerousness while other perfs are perfunctory at best. The Irwins aside the animals are the show and they have been very well cast.

"USATODAY.com - Crocodile Hunter enjoyable for kids Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 07/12/2002 - Updated 1217 PM ET Crocodile Hunter enjoyable for kids By Mike Clark USA TODAY Crocodile Hunter Collision Course (out of four) Rating PG for action violence/peril and mild language Australian Steve Irwin makes the transition from TV host to kiddie-pic hero despite a screen that can barely contain him. Whenever its story isnt bogged down by idiocy involving the CIA and a lost U.S. satellite Hunter -- starring Irwin and his American wife/colleague Terri -- is a movie children should enjoy. There are some scary creatures here -- and not all of them snakes crocs or so-called bird-eating spiders. Actress Magda Szubanski (Babe) intimidates as a shotgun-toting rancher in pursuit of a stock-threatening crocodile -- the same one that has consumed remains of a fallen satellite that agents are trying to locate. Irwin tries to transport the creature to a better habitat. The scaly co-star may have you wincing in your seat but no more so than the king brown snake and ""fierce snake"" whose bites afford you about 10 seconds to get your affairs in order. For reasons unclear Irwin picks them up by the tail and dangles them perilously near a delicate body part. The loopiness of these and other scenes helps you to tolerate the raggedness of this movie.

Starring Steve Irwin. Directed by John Stainton. Written by Holly Goldberg Sloan. (PG. 89 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Steve Irwin the popular Aussie star of the Animal Planet cable network is a live cartoon Outrageous and fearless he handles spiders wrestles crocs dangles cobras just inches from his face and issues his own cranked-up on-the- spot narration. ""Crikey"" Irwin yelps with the goony animation of a pro wrestler. ""Have a go at this whopper"" In his first movie a patched-together espionage yarn Irwin and his American wife Terri are traversing the Outback when the CIA gets the idea that theyre secret agents. Seems a croc has swallowed the black box from a top-secret satellite prompting the feds to suspect the Irwins of data theft. The feds dispatch two agents to the Outback the Irwins mistake them for poachers and madness ensues. Thats not a dreadful premise to hang a movie on but ""Crocodile Hunter"" has a weirdly divided structure that alternates Irwins nature segments with clumsy dramatic footage set in the CIA. The nature stuff is identical to what we see each week on Animal Planet Irwin in the bush sunburned hyped up mugging for the camera handling wild creatures and squawking in wonderment at their magnificent deadliness (""This snake has enough venom to kill me and 100 other blokes""). The dramatic scenes with second-rate actors playing the CIA suits are pure time wasters. Director John Stainton who introduced Irwin to 200 million TV viewers worldwide emphasizes the difference between these two parts by shooting the nature scenes documentary-style with handheld cameras and apparently no script and the dramatic stuff in Super 35mm at a different screen ratio. The result is that Irwins scenes have a freshness and spontaneity -- and a certain charm if you happen to like the guy -- while the CIA stuff just whimpers wheezes and limps along until it dies a wretched death right in front of us. The disparity between the two halves is so wide that one can only marvel that MGM the films distributor didnt order an amputation. As it stands ""Crocodile Hunter"" has the hurried badly cobbled look of the 1959 ""Godzilla"" which combined scenes of a Japanese monster flick with canned shots of Raymond Burr commenting on the monsters path of destruction. Theres another big problem with ""Crocodile Hunter"" and thats Terri Irwins abysmal acting. If her husband is one of the most natural if overenthusiastic of camera subjects Ms. Irwin is one of the most awkward. Toward the end of the film when she and Stevo are required to perform some scripted material her woodenness makes impossible any suspension of disbelief. ""Crocodile Hunter"" also features Magda Szubanski the pumpkin-shaped actress from ""Babe"" as a gun-toting flatulent cattle rancher who hates the crocs and roos that endanger her livestock. Shes a suitable foil for Irwin and a springboard to his frequent pleas for environmental protection. Crocs we learn are essential to the ecosystem and arent the ""mean evil creatures"" that mythology says they are. The perentie a lizard indigenous to Australia and similar to the Komodo dragon grows to 6 feet in length. And the enormous bird-eating spider as big as a newborn kitten makes a barking or whistling sound when alarmed. Learning those facts and seeing Irwin encounter his creatures many of whom he addresses as ""sweetheart"" are the only reason to see ""Crocodile Hunter."" Showing off aside the preservation of wildlife is the motivation behind Irwins work and the reason he takes such ridiculous risks.
