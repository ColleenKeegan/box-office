So declares the phlegmatic leader Jeanine Matthews (Kate Winslet) in the dystopian film Insurgent after ordering a mob of armored meatheads to hunt down Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley). Tris is a teenager whose preternatural talents make her a danger to a society where everyone is sorted into skill-based factions named after a GRE vocabulary word Dauntless Amity Candor Abnegation Erudite and Factionless. Insurgent is rife with bloodshed and high-adrenaline chases and Jeanines line aims to convey the supposedly immense stakes of capturing and killing non-conforming individuals like Tris. But instead her words land like the thinly veiled cliche they are. (You can almost hear the unspoken sarcastic ""DUN DUN DUN"" that follows.)Related Story The Glorious Incoherence of Divergent Perhaps not much should be expected from the follow-up to a widely-panned film based on a derivative-of-a-derivative hit YA novel trilogy by Veronica Roth. But Insurgent isnt a bad film because its a sequel or because its based on a YA novel or because its not particularly original. The Hunger Games Catching Fire and its successor Mockingjay Pt. 1 were all of those things but managed to tell a complex story with a riveting heroine and cast of supporting characters. Even after all the detailed world-building that took place in the first film Insurgent still feels like a pale universe desperately trying to manufacture chaos and emotion for the sake of chaos and emotion. But the movies disregard for cause-and-effect (dei ex machina abound) meaningful relationships and plot hamstrings its efforts to gather narrative momentum for the trilogys two-part finale despite the major twist and cliffhanger at Insurgents close.A brief recap of the events of Divergent Tris conceals her identity as a Divergent and joins the Dauntless faction where she meets an instructor named Four (Theo James) whos also a secret Divergent. During Tris training the two fall in love but they learn of a plot by the Erudite faction to overthrow the ruling Abnegation faction by pulling Dauntless into a war. The pairs identities are discovered and Tris parents die trying to protect her. Tris and Four escape but the Erudite leader Jeanine obtains a special box (protected by Tris parents) whose mysterious contents are rumored to be able to destroy Divergents. The only thing is Jeanine needs a pure Divergent to pass all the simulation tests for each faction in order to open the box. Hence the bounty on Tris head.Insurgent picks up shortly after Divergent ended Tris Four and some other Dauntless are on the lam but have taken refuge in Amitys hippie commune. Traumatized by the death of her parents Tris cuts her hair short because that is what tormented women on screen do (its okay though her boyfriend reluctantly approves). Tris and Four spend most of the film running away from Jeanines henchmen getting caught and then slipping away again a cycle that continues on and on until the last moments. The pair is so often rescued by the auspicious arrival of allies that any suspense concerning their survival feels coerced Clap right in front of someones face once and theyll jolt. Keep doing it and theyll still flinch but more out of instinct or habit than genuine surprise.Its the job of a sequel to complicate themes and problems laid out in the first film but Insurgents plot holes raise questions that distract more than they stimulate. Why does Jeanine think the box holds the key to eradicating all Divergents when she doesnt even know whats inside? How does the much-discussed issue of ""jurisdiction"" work in the justice system of Divergents post-apocalyptic Chicago? Why has no one ventured beyond the wall that surrounds the city to see if theres any life left? In what world could people with too many talents (Divergents) possibly be seen as more dangerous and worthy of derision than people with minimal to no talents (Factionless)?Insurgent had the potential to be a perfectly decent spring-time blockbuster.As Noah Berlatsky has pointed out the illogical nature of the Divergent world has its roots in the works of the science-fiction author Philip K. Dick who created self-aware discontinuous universes forcing the audience to fill in the gaps. Its maybe a more generous reading than Insurgent deserves Roth herself has acknowledged that the narrative disjunction between the first and second novels was due to overlapping drafts. The film tries to smooth over this laziness with white-knuckle chase scenes dramatic confrontations and mind-spinning simulation sequences. Sometimes the action (especially when viewed in IMAX 3-D) floods the senses to the point where the bigger clunky themes of the movie blissfully vanish and all that matters is that the protagonists outrun the latest wall of bullets.If its cast is any indication Insurgent had the potential to be a perfectly decent spring-time blockbuster. Woodley is already a darling of the teen crowd (The Fault in Our Stars The Secret Life of the American Teenager) and shes been praised for her acting in the past (The Spectacular Now The Descendants). But while Jennifer Lawrence proved she could keep pace with the ever-darker ever-more-grim Hunger Games movies Woodley wobbles a bit under the weight of her own less elegantly realized franchise. Shes surrounded by an impressive (largely female) supporting cast--Winslet Octavia Spencer as the Amity leader Naomi Watts as Fours mother and Factionless leader--that is sadly underused. Perhaps the brightest spot of the entire film is Miles Teller (Whiplash) as Tris Dauntless frenemy Peter. Tellers delightful scene-stealing presence would feel unfair to the rest of the cast if he werent such a welcome respite.In all Insurgent may work as a deafening frivolous diversion for viewers who can ignore the flimsiness of its universe plot and characters. Admittedly it doesnt look very good for the franchise that the film is actually a significantly abridged version of the novel If the writers took creative liberties in order to simplify the source material why couldnt they have done so to create a more consistent story? Of course Insurgent didnt need an airtight plot infinitely layered characters or Mad Men-esque dialogue to work. But it also didnt need to be good at all to recoup its roughly 120 million budget and then some which it most certainly will. After all this is a film based on a trilogy whose author sold the movie rights to her work mere months after she wrote it. The Divergent series is the kind of elaborate moody pabulum that was always destined to become a massive (if clumsy) tentpole beast; Insurgent is for all its flaws keeping air in the lungs of that legacy.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

Do our Facebook posts reflect our true personalities? Incrementally probably not. But in aggregate the things we say on social media paint a fairly accurate portrait of our inner selves. A team of University of Pennsylvania scientists is using Facebook status updates to find commonalities in the words used by different ages genders and even psyches. The so-called ""World Well-Being Project"" started as an effort to gauge happiness across various states and communities. ""Governments have an increased interest in measuring not just economic outcomes but other aspects of well-being"" said Andrew Schwartz a UPenn computer scientist who works on the project. ""But its very difficult to study well-being at a large scale. It costs a lot of money to administer surveys to see how people are doing in certain areas. Social media can help with that.""

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Entertainment ""Insurgent"" Is Annoyingly Contradictory If this is a franchise about fighting for equality why is its heroines specialness all about the way she was born? Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Theo James and Shailene Woodley in Insurgent Andrew Cooper / Lionsgate ID 5301030 Like most dystopian YA protagonists Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley) the heroine of the Divergent film franchise is fighting to save her world. Its a world that as outlined out in Veronica Roths trilogy of books on which the movies are based is highly regimented but conceptually fuzzy. Everyone has been divvied up into five factions -- Abnegation Amity Candor Dauntless and Erudite -- based on their personality types but also maybe on biological factors as well? Children are shuffled off for testing to determine their faction/personality type when they turn 16 though theyre allowed to pick whichever faction most appeals to them at the big Choosing Ceremony -- its a huge decision given that factional allegiance takes precedent over family ties. And by the sequel Insurgent which is now in theaters people are able to whip out a scanner to read someones makeup which makes you wonder about the point of the whole simulation/ceremony aspect to begin with. So the faction system despite helping maintain peace clearly sucks placing the surviving members of society into one of five improbable virtuous boxes with the remnants consigned to the outcast Factionless. Divergent and Insurgent have revolution on their mind though it bubbles up indirectly as Tris and her boyfriend Four (Theo James) discover a scheme in which some evil Erudites try to overthrow Abnegation in order to take control of the government. In Insurgent Tris now on the run is initially only focused on revenge though its clear there are larger changes in the works. Meeting with Evelyn (Naomi Watts) the Factionless head (and Fours estranged mother) Tris is entreated to help ""put an end to a system that says one group is more deserving than another."" ID 5298132 Andrew Cooper / Lionsgate Andrew Cooper / Lionsgate ID 5301067 Its a nice message even if Evelyns motivations are a bit questionable. The problem and the most frustrating thing about the Divergent series -- more than the preposterousness of its world building more than its humorlessness more than the general sense that its just making things up as it goes along -- is that it doesnt believe Evelyns message at all. Tris is undeniably the most special person in her post-apocalyptic Chicago universe entirely because of qualities she was born with. By Insurgent everyone is trying to find her because of her unique qualities. Tris is Divergent meaning her personality cannot be confined to just one faction and she feels terrible about it (""I never wanted any of this"" she tearily confesses) because it makes her stand out as the only person apparently capable of being brave and forgiving and honest and smart and nice all at once. Even the nefarious Jeanine (Kate Winslet) ends up admitting ""this girl is extraordinary."" The exceptional qualities overtly assigned to Tris rarely come through in her actions -- though the bars low in a world where its a rarity for someone to be kind AND courageous. She makes some terrible strategic decisions in Insurgent her main personality traits involve wallowing in unfounded guilt and so few of her choices are active or part of any thought-out plan. Theres even a dashing rescue sequence that turns out to be needless because Tris realizes shes actually where she needed to be all along. It doesnt even matter. Insurgents convenient scanners affirm its heroine to be 100% Divergent the most out of everyone and thats good enough for the story. But it doesnt have to be good enough for the audience.

"Armed and Tedious Sean Penn Bulks Up for The Gunman and Shailene Woodley Gets Stuck in Insurgent << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Armed and Tedious Sean Penn Bulks Up for The Gunman and Shailene Woodley Gets Stuck in Insurgent Open Road Films Movies March 20 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Sean Penn now has a body that invites scientific study. The veins in his arms are the size of fire hoses. His pecs and abs converge to form a diamond in the upper middle of his trunk. These are the things you tend to notice in The Gunman because the frequency with which Penn is half-naked is not unnoticeable. You notice not because his shirtlessness is sexy but because it feels pathologically vain. Hes playing an American operative named Jimmy Terrier whose assassination of a Congolese mining minister sets off a series of international calamities -- for him. Penn moves from scene to scene almost solely to find new excuses to wear nothing. Hes 54 and the prominence of his body is a matter of prerogative. At that age when youve still got it flaunt it. But Penn doesnt simply flaunt it. He Stallones it. The opening minutes put you in a hopeful place. Broadcast news footage establishes that the Democratic Republic of the Congo is under siege. Civilians are caught in a cross fire featuring the government rebel militiamen and private contractors battling for control over the countrys coveted western-bound natural resources. Thousands have been killed injured and displaced. Members of NGOs are risking their lives to save lives. The ground is laid for a decent political thriller. More The Gunman Armed and Tedious Sean Penn Bulks Up For The Gunman Qamp;A Director Pierre Morel on The Gunman Taken and Inventing the Vengeance-of-Liam-Neeson Genre Peaks and Valleys The Career of Sean Penn But within five minutes the movie declares its true priorities. Jimmy saunters into a Kinshasa bar toting a mustache looking for his lady love -- Annie (Jasmine Trinca) a doctor at a camp -- the very lady for whom his pal Felix (Javier Bardem) has the hots. You cant believe war-torn Congo is being used as the backdrop for the love triangle scene in Tequila Sunrise but here we are with Jimmy making out with and waking up beside Annie who rises from bed and proceeds in sunlit splendor to do the beautiful-woman-stands-on-a-balcony-wearing-only-a-mans-dress-shirt thing. After the assassination Jimmy has to vanish on Annie and the contracting company which eight years later has spread -- cancerously one presumes -- around the globe. He resurfaces off the coast of Africa topless on a surfboard (wetsuits are for pussies; so apparently are mustaches since Jimmys is gone). He rises from the water like Botticellis Spicoli. Now Jimmy is do-gooding for a well-digging NGO breaking all the rules (catching waves is a security risk). One afternoon mid-dig a quartet of rebels comes after him and he obliterates three of them (his shell-shocked assistant shoots the fourth). What do they want? Whoever sent them needed a vial of Jimmys blood for confirmation of his death. Worried he flies to Europe for answers from his old colleagues. One guy (Mark Rylance) is near the top of the company and knows nothing. Felix is in Barcelona shacked up with Annie and refuses to let Jimmy have her back. These alas are the stakes for a movie titled The Gunman and gratuitously featuring an actual humanitarian crisis as a backdrop The girl is mine. So we get a fancy-restaurant scene with these three in which Jimmy surprises Annie by showing up and Bardem surprises us by being terrible. His acting here is so gassy that each of his scenes ought to end with ""excuse me."" Hes bad with gusto of course. ""Youre humiliating me"" says Annie to Felix. ""The way you stare at him humiliates you"" he replies with a hiss. She flees Jimmy chases after her gives her his address to give to Felix and a scene later opens the door and finds her standing before him ready to lock mouths and genitalia. Kinshasas burning but who cares? This sex is on fire too. Annie is a musty Marion Cotillard-Penelope Cruz part. Trincas from Italy and in Italian (and with actual writing) she can act. Here shes somewhere between Isabella Rossellini and a bulbless lamp. Trincas here for the movies villain to kidnap and drag to the climax at a Barcelona bullring where an almost enjoyably stupid kitchen-sink finale awaits. Before that Annie and Felixs country villa is so extravagantly demolished that you hope theyve got action-movie insurance. Ray Winstone and Idris Elba turn up for cruelly brief bits and Rylance proves he cant think of a reason not to go to town on any acting assignment. Has there been a movie to span such a gamut of sleazy-sexy men? In Spain youd call it morbo. Penns rendition thinks it warrants ambassadorship. I object to The Gunman because its unconvincing and incoherent. It gives Jimmy post-concussive head trauma which causes him excruciating blackouts and reflects the state of mind in which this movie appears to have been concocted. Director Pierre Morel also did the original District B13 the first Taken and the fragrant stink bomb From Paris With Love each of which rocketed off Luc Bessons assembly line. This is a Joel Silver production so it prioritizes ""boom"" over ""LOL."" Without Bessons sense of the consciously absurd Morel is left to conjure his own version. Thats how you wind up with that bullring sequence. But the whole movie feels commissioned as if Penn saw Liam Neeson and John Travolta and thought Stunt doubles are also for pussies. Stab me Dislocate my shoulder Im gonna win the scene. And Ill smoke many cigarettes as I do (Anton Corbijns The American with George Clooney as an assassin in Europe was a sleepier artier less steroidal trot over similar terrain.) Penn takes a screenplay credit on The Gunman shared with Don Macpherson and Pete Travis. Its a puffed-up misapprehension of the pure pulp of Jean-Patrick Manchettes The Prone Gunman from 1981. That puffing up leads to my second objection. Why bother with all of this international intrigue just to treat Penns body as a tourist attraction? By the time hes running around that stadium wearing only a bulletproof vest above the waist youre certain youre seeing a parody of vanity except Penns acting in the last 20 years has become so generally joyless that he makes you feel blasphemous for laughing at him. This is the problem with his inside joke at last months Academy Awards to Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (""Who gave this guy a green card?""). You dont know how to laugh with Sean Penn because he doesnt seem to find himself funny. When Tom Cruise is half-dressed in a film you can cheer his ridiculousness -- he practically turns himself on. What turns Penn on about himself often seems to have little to do with the movies. Hes among the cause-iest of stars having dipped a steel-toed boot into one political quagmire after the next. A Hollywood activist like Angelia Jolie survives this disjunction between being an action figure and a humanitarian because she works mostly in the realms of melodrama science fiction and fantasy. But touristic self-importance pollutes The Gunman. Penns preening obstructs your view of atrocity. He doesnt care that like the ""Jimmy"" Neesons currently playing in Run All Night and the ""Jimmy"" Penn played in Mystic River these are immoral heroes given heroizing plots. Stardom is its own morality. Now its as if Penn cant do a lousy action movie without even a patina of world betterment. But the world hes trying to better here feels pitifully tiny -- its his own.  Andrew Cooper/LionsgateI feel bad for these Divergent movies. Theyre a mess mostly because the Veronica Roth books theyre based on are a mess too. I appreciate the attempt to try to make this world -- an obliterated totalitarian Chicago -- as watchable as possible. But theres too much to keep straight. The first movie explained that the citys been carved into five factional camps determined by aptitude and personality type Abnegation Amity Candor Dauntless and Erudite. Some are Factionless. The seriess hero Tris (Shailene Woodley) is most rare a multi-factional called a Divergent. The second movie -- Insurgent -- keeps explaining. Tris has joined with members of Dauntless who are now in pursuit of taking out the corporate oppressor a hard-faced Erudite named Jeanine Matthews (Kate Winslet leaning all the way in). Sensing a coup Jeanine needs to open a mysterious box that she believes will restore order. But only a Divergent can unlock it and this can be done only by luring one in and jacking into her nervous system. Six human lab rats have died trying. But Jeanine deduces that Tris is The One and must be captured. Costumes are supposed to help tell whos who. The gang over at Amity for instance all seem like cashiers at an Amish food market outfitted all in dark synthetic-looking fabrics and a cheery demeanor; Dauntless looks ready for Mad Max Turn Off the Dark. But everything about these movies seems substandard. The effects are probably state-of-the-art. They just dont look that way. (All 3-D ever enhances is a sense of cheapness.) In movies there are action sequences that defy physics and action sequences like the ones in Insurgent that defy coherence. Forced to open that box for Jeanine Tris must hang from coaxial cables while in a virtual world she swings on metal rods and crashes into rubble and fire. Its painfully off-brand sci-fi The Nay-trix. Through it all Triss macho-emo Dauntless boyfriend Four (Theo James) comes to her rescue. (Every time someone says his name I hear a baby trying to say ""Thor."") When Divergent opened last year I joined the chorus of yawners who complained of Roths intellectual opportunism -- you think George Orwell; you think The Hunger Games; you think ""Somebody call a lawyer."" Naturally that holds for Part 2. Roth pilfers but fails to dramatize and so the movies (Brian Duffield Akiva Goldsman and Mark Bomback are Insurgents credited screenwriters; Robert Schwentke directed) have no higher idea to point toward not one that aroused any excitement for the remaining two installments. It should help that head-turning actors keep turning up -- Octavia Spencer Janet McTeer Daniel Dae Kim and Naomi Watts are new; Miles Teller Ansel Elgort Zoe Kravitz Mekhi Phifer Maggie Q and Ashley Judd are not. But they show up to advance more of the plot. No one has anything to play. Not only does the movie have no real drama it lacks an emotional center like the one Jennifer Lawrence supplies for The Hunger Games. You miss the a la carte funk and spunk that Elizabeth Banks and Jena Malone give to those movies and the seasoning Donald Sutherland passes along. Insurgent too easily reverts to violence -- and in a neutralizing manner too. Ive never shrugged at this many massacres suicide attempts and point-blank murders. Its startling how not startling all of the grisliness is. This leaves Woodley with only conventional displays of toughness head smashing gun toting glass shattering none of which she executes with any conviction. She has no rousing speeches or memorable lines just haircuts marksmanship agility and tears all of which sound like the very last thing these movies need more factions.

Its set in a future American dystopia thats divided into personality-based ""factions"" oppressed by a government headed by the tyrannical Jeanine (Kate Winslet). Tris (Shailene Woodley) is among the ""divergent""--those with too much moxie for any one slot who are considered enemies of the state. Facing arrest Tris her boyfriend Four (Theo James) and her brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) escape to urban ruins where Jeanine catches her and subjects her to a series of ""sims""--death-defying A.I. adventures that test both character and survival skills in order to open a mystic box of secrets that will save Jeanines decadent and shaky regime. These imaginary adventures--which can truly get Tris killed--are the core of the film and theyre wild rides starting with the snakelike cables that connect and suspend Tris. Many of her acrobatic ordeals take place high above the ravaged skyline and theyre not for acrophobes; the dissolution of her simulated victims into digital detritus is among the films more memorable gimmicks. Theres little substance and little depth but Woodley with her preternatural poise offers a worthy simulation of drama.

"Insurgent | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; insurgent ) Insurgent (United States 2015) March 19 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli In my review of Divergent the opening installment of the four-movie series of which Insurgent is the second part I wrote the following ""As an entry point into a new world Divergent provides a worthwhile portal. This is the kind of reality and society that upon closer examination could become compulsively watchable."" Indeed Divergent seemed like set-up for a big bold story that I expected to be told (at least in part) in Insurgent. Unfortunately instead of forming the backbone of the series narrative trajectory Insurgent feels like filler. Not a lot happens during the course of the movies 119-minute running time and much of what does happen is disappointingly generic. Insurgent is far too long for the minimal plot it encapsulates features little in the way of meaningful character development and is riddled with instances of poorly conceived contrived developments. The films focal point is this worlds equivalent of a Chinese puzzle box an impervious container that can only be opened by a so-called Divergent who is strong in all five disciplines (Erudite Dauntless Abnegation Amity and Candor) and can prove it by succeeding at various cyber challenges. Its a silly concept and Insurgents clumsy execution does little to convince us that its not merely a McGuffin. Former Erudite leader-cum-Evil Dictator Jeanine (Kate Winslet) is in possession of the box and believes its secrets will validate her strong-arm tactics. So she locates and captures Tris (Shailene Woodley) the only Divergent with a ""100% Divergence"" rating. This leads to series of drawn-out virtual reality games in which Tris plays second fiddle to special effects. These sequences resemble levels in a video game and are devoid of any sort of suspense or tension (dramatic or otherwise). They pad the length and bore the viewer. Theres other stuff going on as well. The fugitives who fled the city at the end of Divergent are searching for a way to return to overthrow Jeanine. To that end Four (Theo James) is forced into an uneasy alliance with his previously-thought-to-be-dead mother Evelyn (Naomi Watts). The love story between Tris and Four is thrown onto the back burner although the two canoodle a little before engaging in PG-13 sex. Whatever chemistry may have existed between lead actress Shailene Woodley and hunky Theo James has vanished between films. Theyre about as connected as the miscast leads in 50 Shades of Grey. Tris must also deal with betrayal - her brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) and the duplicitous Peter (Miles Teller) align with Jeanine. (Both actors incidentally have played Woodleys lovers in previous films - Teller in The Spectacular Now and Elgort in The Fault in Our Stars.) One of many disappointments in Insurgent is the way the screenplay treats Tris. Although some may feel it unfair to compare Woodleys character to Jennifer Lawrences Katniss in The Hunger Games series its fitting because the two have much in common. However whereas Katniss evolved to command the screen in the second chapter of her saga Tris regresses. At times she feels like a secondary character in Insurgent and theres little evidence of growth or forward momentum. Woodley is a fine actress and the character remains sympathetic but Tris fails to leave an indelible mark. Many of the other cast members including Kate Winslet and Naomi Watts are on hand for reasons other than satisfying a creative urge leaving it to Miles Teller to steal scenes with his smirking morally ambiguous performance. The movies post-apocalyptic depiction of Chicago looks fine although it can be difficult to tell through the haze of poor post-conversion 3D. Director Robert Schwentkes vision has been compromised. Those who see this in IMAX 3D will be more distracted. The IMAX 3D introduction (""10...9...8...etc."") is one of the best uses of 3D to-date in a movie theater and to follow it with the lame blurry film that follows shows how horrifically bad the Insurgent conversion is. Unwatchable comes to mind and thats not an exaggeration. If you choose to see this movie dont do it in any non-2D format. On a positive note the film has a refreshingly straightforward attitude toward killing and violence. When it comes to executing their enemies these characters dont hesitate. There are a couple of unexpected deaths in Insurgent and when they come they occur with unusual haste. No waiting around for the climax of the third or fourth film. Then again to balance the scales theres a ""fake death"" that could be seen as either an ""homage"" to or a ""steal"" from Star Treks ""Amok Time"" (depending on how charitably youre disposed toward the makers of Insurgent). Insurgent is more clumsy than bad but it disappoints because it wastes the world-building of Divergent which set the stage for something more momentous than what the sequel delivers. In the tradition of other Young Adult series the final book of this trilogy Allegiant has been broken into two films; it remains to be seen whether those chapters can fulfill the promise of the first installment or like this one will exist for little purpose beyond separating devoted fans from their hard-earned dollars.

Of course the real adventure here is in the Divergent (read complicated) soul belonging to pixie-hero Tris (Shailene Woodley alternatingly adorable and sullen). Shes got some things to work out mostly having to do with the way her friends and loved ones keep dying all around her. But theres a reason Platos Republic is a work of philosophy not drama. To use the term of the times there is something problematic in reducing your worlds characters to a single trait. For instance when you have someone from Dauntless say that hes not a meathead doesnt that mean hes also an Erudite? And doesnt that make him one of the problematic Divergents? Theres also something problematic in those Divergents at least from a story standpoint its hard to make a compelling action story out of someone full of Abnegation and Amity. Its all a bit of an unengaging muddle covered over with concrete grunge clean white labs and stagy special effects. 2015. -- Matthew Lickona This movie is not currently in theaters.

Running time 1 hour 58 minutes  The rebellious women of Insurgent break the action mold Given that conformity is the scourge of the ""Divergent"" series and much of its young-adult ilk its a shame that the films including the new ""Insurgent"" do so little to stray from well-worn YA paths.For a series that waves the banner of individualism they make a poor case for it. Instead of throbbing with a teenage spirit of rebellion  or things like youthful wildness humor or sex  the two ""Divergent"" movies are curiously content to eke out a rigid lifeless fable in drab futuristic environs.The answer here to the question of what are you rebelling against isnt ""Whaddya got?"" but the slightly less visceral ""An elaborate highly metaphorical dystopian system of militaristic control.""But even faint fantastical whiffs of teen insurrection carry enough potency to drive feverish young audiences. Why? Much of it has to do with the stars.Say what you will about YA movies but theyve been an efficient star-making machine thats produced Jennifer Lawrence Kristen Stewart and Shailene Woodley. We should be happy to have them good actresses all who easily lead their respective films over their male counterparts.The YA men arent as fine a bunch but here include the hunky Theo James and the excellent Miles Teller. Predictably providing ""Insurgent"" with its only lively comedic moments Teller looks as if he didnt get the note that all must be sullen and serious.A quick summary. Based on Veronica Roths trilogy of best-selling novels the ""Divergent"" films are set in a walled post-apocalyptic Chicago where survivors are ritualistically sorted into five factions. Every 16-year-old is tested for which faction suits them and then must choose one and remain there forever.Tris (Woodley) chose Dauntless who are known for their bravery and it seems their proclivity for train hopping. But her test revealed her to be ""divergent""  someone who has no dominant characteristic but a plethora  and this makes her uncontrollable. In ""Divergent"" Tris came to embrace her fate find a boyfriend in Dauntless leader Four (James who has a natural chemistry with Woodley) and stop a plot by the citys overlord Janine (Kate Winslet) to make zombies of its citizens.""Insurgent"" the full name of which is the suitably clunky ""The Divergent Series Insurgent"" finds the tale largely spinning its wheels and features many redundant confrontations. Along with an underground revolutionary leader played by an underused Naomi Watts Tris and Four organize a revolt against Janine.Allegiances are in constant flux; Tellers sarcastic operator switches sides with the wind. The plot (which includes Tris brother played by Ansel Elgort and Jai Courtneys burly enforcer) progresses less in a forward motion than in a repetitive cycle of escapes surrenders and rescues often taking place in the same hallways.Executions at gunpoint and frequently threatened suicide add to the cheery atmosphere.Much of the drama of ""Insurgent"" takes place in a virtual reality in which Tris frequently faces various simulation challenges forcing her to reconcile her guilt in the death of her parents as seen in the first installment.These ""sims"" are where ""Insurgent"" flashes its fanciest effects but this dream state just further removes the film from any tangible reality. ""Insurgent"" is already an allegorical fantasy.The way of many YA adaptations is to make the first film cheaply and then once its popularity has been proven boost the production value in subsequent sequels.Thats the case with the 3-D ""Insurgent"" where director Robert Schwentke (""R.I.P.D."") takes over for ""Divergent"" helmer Neil Burger. The result is a bigger glossier and better made action film with less embarrassing fight choreography. But any appeal still depends entirely on the talent of its cast.The final ""Divergent"" book will be split into two movies a future that is indeed a little dystopian. Much brighter though are the blossoming careers of Woodley and Teller who were best together in the indie ""The Spectacular Now."" Movies thankfully come in factions too.

Photo Andrew Cooper/Lionsgate The best things in the secondA DivergentA picture rhymingly titledA InsurgentA (I believe the third in which the rebels clean house will be calledA Detergent) are the dreams and visions of its heroine Tris (Shailene Woodley). Dreams and visions tend to be the dopiest parts of thrillers especially when theyre fake-outs -- i.e. the hero or heroine dies violently and then wakes up with a start. But in this case those interludes areA beautiful. The divergent Tris hurtles over sides of buildings and swings from ledge to ledge with the kind of speed and lyricism that would leave Spider-Man panting in his web. She reaches out to loved ones who slowly agonizingly disintegrate reduced to shards that scatter in the cosmic wind. Director Robert Schwentke stages the climactic vaguely Samp;M setpiece -- in which Trish hangs suspended from multiple electrodes plugged into her body -- so sensationally that you can almost forget the silly plodding script which is likeA Flash GordonA with dystopian pretensions and creepy politics.A InsurgentA is not a very good movie but its better than it needs to be. That said if you come to it not having seen Divergent youre fucked. No attempt is made to bring you up to speed -- that would endanger the download revenue stream. Youll just have to resign yourself to watching chases in a vacuum The good guys run away get caught and tied up get freed by other good guys bursting in with guns then run away and get caught and tied up again. The non-dream action scenes are reasonably well-choreographed but theres nothing memorable about them. I did on the other hand have a memorable evening in the theater having been invited to the New York premiere at the Ziegfeld -- where the entrances of most major characters were met with variations of yaaaahhhhhhh. Ansel Elgort (sitting about five rows behind me) was especially beloved perhaps because hes still so charmingly abashed by his celebrity. (In interviews he has grooved on how easy it is to get laid.) Lost idol Daniel Dae Kim -- leader of the Candor sect -- sat a row behind me and was gracious about posing for selfies. My affections are easily purchased. But I cant extend that goodwill to the Divergent novels. The author Veronica Roth isnt a tenth as talented as The Hunger Games Suzanne Collins but she has a more powerful agenda. In this bleak future humans are divided into factions which I now can write from memory Abnegation Candor Dauntless Erudite and -- uh er as Rick Perry would say oops gotta look it up -- Amity (the Amish). The only ones you need to worry about are the Erudites the scholars who enslave the Dauntless grunts with high-tech drugs and direct them to massacre threats to the state. Its a matter of record that the 20th centurys nefarious mass murderers -- from Stalin to Hitler to Mao to Pol Pot -- eliminated the intellectuals first because (the thinking went) educated people were equipped to resist deprogramming. But the ultrareligious Roth has evidently bought into the right-wing view of education as a dangerous thing. (Former senator Rick Santorum has openly questioned the wisdom of underwriting leftist indoctrination while Wisconsin governorA Scott Walker a college dropout has proposed redirecting education money to provide property-tax relief for Pennsylvanias wealthiest.) Those who think Divergent is just a dumb ""franchise"" with no political agenda need to think a tad harder about why an author would target people who actually know things (and are not ideologues). The first half of Insurgent is diffuse and uninvolving but Shailene keeps us watching with her cool unshowy thoughtful acting which lifts even the stupidest plot turns above the Flash Gordon level. Shes not especially fun though. I dont dare criticize the inhumanly hunky Theo James for fear of being shunned by my older daughter. Nor can I ridicule Elgort who earned enough points from his noble death inA The Fault in Our Stars to make Triss vacillating brother halfway compelling. (Its odd though that this Erudite doesnt have the intellectual equipment to make moral decisions.) As the smug opportunistic Peter the reliable Miles Teller is tripped up by the poor screenplay His pivots in the novel made some sense but in the film hes just a cheap device. Erudite Kate Winslet is Insurgents Ming the Merciless who seeks the key to a sacred box that can only be opened by a divergent -- preferably a 100 percent super-duper divergent able to run the neurological gauntlet without her synapses being fried. The character is a one-dimensional fanatic but my heart goes out to Winslet -- another middle-aged A-lister who takes roles in ""franchises"" to be able to sustain her celebrity lifestyle. Naomi Watts -- who plays Jamess devious mom -- is obviously onboard for the same reasons and if her fee enables her to bless a few indie directors with her presence who am I to grouse? There are many reasons to give Insurgent a pass but none of them is pure. Correction A previous version of this piece misidentified Rick Santorum as the governor of Wisconsin. The governor ofA Wisconsin is Scott Walker.

Theres less exposition more action and a discernible spark in the acting that was missing before. But lets face it the trilogy of young-adult novels that Veronica Roth cooked up to rival The Hunger Games never loses the stale odor of also-ran. The Divergent Series to be completed by carving two films out of Allegiant the third novel isnt being goosed by inspiration -- try box-office gold.

Shailene Woodley who never gives less than her all again plays Tris Prior the films Joan of Arc. Tris is a divergent meaning she doesnt fit the molds set up by Jeanine (Kate Winslet) who rules the dystopian futuristic society that is a walled-in Chicago. You know Jeanines the boss because shes the only one in skyscraper heels. As Insurgent begins Tris foments rebellion in the company of Tobias Eaton (Theo James) a fellow divergent who goes by the name of Four because he fears only four things sequels not among them. James a solid actor mostly glowered in the first movie. Here he busts loose shows his vulnerability and runs afoul of a new enemy Evelyn (Naomi Watts) the mother who abandoned him as a child. Yikes. Dont want spoilers for those not among the 32 million who bought the novels. It seems odd that a movie that celebrates divergence would conform so rigidly to formula. Theres a new director Robert Schwentke in for Neil Burger and a whole new army of screenwriters but everyones still connecting the dots. The film peaks with a series of tests for Tris that play like a gamers fantasy of virtual reality. Surprise is lacking. Ditto humor though Miles Teller (Whiplash) as a thorn in Fours side gets in a few fun licks by not staying on the films draggy tempo. Otherwise Insurgent stubbornly fails to surge.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 20 2015 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Mar. 20 2015 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Robert Schwentke Written by Brian Duffield Akiva Goldsman and Mark Bomback Starring Shailene Woodley Theo James Miles Teller Ansel Elgort Kate Winslet Naomi Watts Classification PG Country USA Language English In the battle between dystopian science-fiction movies about butt-kicking young heroines the new Divergent movie Insurgent is actually slightly more believably glum than the third Hunger Games movie The Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 1.Of course Divergent and Hunger Games are pitched at different registers. The Hunger Games which plays like campy opera is future-medieval with forests and courts monitored on high-tech surveillance. Divergent is set in the Chicago of the future where despite the governments assurances that everything is perfect the city looks like a forest of dead high-rises surrounded by collapsed parking garages. The Divergent series which is aimed at a slightly younger crowd than The Hunger Games is a protest against conformity and social streaming subjects that are a big deal when youre getting ready for college applications. But the movies premise drawn from Veronica Roths books is its weakest part a gimmicky device that never makes much sense. Society as we learned at length in the first movie is divided into five ""factions"" based on different ""virtues"" - Abnegation Amity Candor Dauntless and Erudite. The Erudites rule though oddly theyre not bothered that the names are an awkward mix of nouns and adjectives.Tris (Shailene Woodley) born in the selfless Abnegation caste turns out to be genetically ""divergent"" meaning she shares qualities from other groups. In practical terms that means shes smart compassionate ready to kill and bound to feel badly about it.As we begin the second movie the power struggle is already under way between Triss cohort and the evil leader Jeanine (Kate Winslet with fierce Joan Crawford eyebrows) and her storm troopers who race around carrying guns the size of vacuum cleaners.Proving shes ready for action Tris cuts her hair in a stylish punk warrior bob while hiding out on an Amity hippie commune. Shes accompanied by her handsome but dull bodyguard-boyfriend Four (Theo James) her milquetoast brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) and the double-dealing Peter played by Whiplashs Miles Teller who looks like a sneering young Elvis and has a bad habit of stealing the movie whenever hes onscreen.Soon Tris and Four are chased back to the downtown and meet the various punky hordes of the ""Factionless"" who hang around warehouses like theyre waiting for a rave to happen. In this female-centric film theres a new player - Naomi Watts as Fours estranged mother now a revolutionary leader who wants to help topple Jeanine and is bound to get more screen time in the next two movies.Most of the best stuff is saved for Insurgents last half-hour in which the movie goes ""lysergic"" as on an acid trip. Tris in a self-sacrificing gesture goes to Jeanines headquarters and allows herself to be subjected to a series of ""sims"" or virtual reality simulations. All this is thanks to a MacGuffin of a magic box (invented by the screenwriters) that was left behind by the citys founders to send a message to the future.Finally director Robert Schwentke (Flightplan) opens things up with a series of Matrix/Inception-style journeys into Triss inner world. As her body lies on a hammock of tentacles attached to electrodes (reminiscent of Jane Fonda in Barbarella) Triss mind sends her chasing a floating burning house across the sky and engaging in a rooftop battle with her own double.What any of this has to do with social conformity is unclear but if they ever make a Divergent theme park this ride should be worth the lineup.

USA TODAYOctavia Spencer in a scene from The Divergent Series Insurgent.(Photo Andrew Cooper Lionsgate)""I know this doesnt make any sense insists Shailene Woodleys Tris at a key moment in The Divergent Series Insurgent.That sentiment pretty much sums up this listless sequel ( 1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide). This second installment based on Veronica Roths series of YA novels feels cobbled together and less focused than 2014s Divergent and lacks tension and excitement.Tris and Four (Theo James) the post-apocalyptic lovebirds are fugitives from the confining -- and ungrammatical -- social system that sorts citizens into five factions based on human virtues Amity Abnegation Candor Erudite and Dauntless.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Now on the run from Jeanine and the rest of the power-hungry Erudites Tris and Four search for allies and answers in the ruins of Chicago. VPCThey must hide out because theyve been exposed as divergent which means they dont fit precisely into any one category. Divergents are seen as treacherous members to be destroyed by megalomaniacal leader Jeanine (Kate Winslet). But its clear shes threatened by these advanced and liberated folks.Pursued by the icy Jeanine who is a staunch member of the Erudite group Tris and Four barely elude her henchmen. Along their escape path the couple endures a painful truth serum a perilous train ride and plenty of chases and fights. Tris whose parents (Ashley Judd and Tony Goldwyn) died in the first movie is obsessed by thoughts that shes dangerous because everyone around her dies. Her haunted mental state surely accounts for her grim expression throughout most of the movie. But everybody else looks miserable as well -- even the kindly sorts who make up Amity overseen by the ever-patient Johanna (Octavia Spencer).From left Shailene Woodley Theo James and Ansel Elgort are on the run in ""Insurgent."" (Photo Andrew Cooper Lionsgate)Where other dystopian sci-fi movies are mired in exposition this one could have used a bit more explanation and logic. How does Tris brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) become a minion of the evil Jeanine overnight? And why? How can ambitious Peter (Miles Teller) work his way into Jeanines inner sanctum so quickly?Tris must take part in a variety of virtual reality simulations including one self-loathing exercise in which she fights herself with no sense of tension whatsoever.At least the dashing Four has Tris back. They hole up in the underground quarters of the rebellious but impoverished Factionless and meet up with the conniving Evelyn (Naomi Watts). Four professes his love for Tris repeatedly but their chemistry is less apparent than in the first film.Woodley and James seem merely to be going through the motions. Their ultra-seriousness combined with lackluster performances add up to a dreary experience for viewers. 36 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/03/19/insurgent-review/25005725/",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/03/19/insurgent-review/25005725/,200,thedivergentseriesinsurgent11,thedivergentseriesinsurgent,usatoday

What I still dont get is how it would benefit a dictatorship to segregate its population into ""factions"" based on genetically-dictated labels like nerd/brainiac jock hippie good-guys and compulsive truth-tellers. So second time around I still dont buy whats happening in the ruins of what used to be Chicago (although Im guessing Armageddon took place shortly after the Cubs won the World Series). But I will say that in lieu of exposition or character development Insurgent - part two of what will be four Divergent movies - hits the ground literally running and ends up with an entire last act of expensive FX purportedly taking place inside a characters head. This last was really amazing when the movie I saw it in was called Inception. Mobile users click this link But leave your doubts and critical facilities at the door and Insurgent is two hours of the best FX filler money can buy punctuated by young people hitting and shooting each other. When we last saw the Divergent Tris (Shailene Woodley) shed been passing herself off as a member of the paramilitary faction Dauntless had fallen in love with the young leader Four (Theo James) and thwarted the plan of the evil Erudite leader Jeanine (Kate Winslet) to take over the city with an army of brainwashed Dauntless. As Insurgent begins Tris Four Triss wussy Erudite brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) and the obnoxious Dauntless soldier Peter (Miles Teller) are on the run having been framed by Jeanine for the abortive coup. Like Dorothy touring Oz one step ahead of the Witch Triss travels introduce us to the other faction leaders including Octavia Spencer leader of the hippie faction Amity Losts Daniel Dae Kim leader of the truthtelling Candor and Naomi Watts leader of the Factionless faction (which is the one I would have belonged to in high school). Oddly the Factionless faction is a fairly paramilitary bunch - sort of like Dauntlesss B-team. This is what passes for exposition in the Divergent movies a quickie tourist jaunt; a snapshot if you will of post-bad-stuff Chicago. Mobile users click this link And then Insurgent goes literally mental. Seems theres a box with a secret message from the Founders that Jeanine rescued from Triss parents. She seems to think the message will be a game-changer and when she discovers that only a Divergent will be able to open the box she sets out to find them and perform lethal brain experiments on them to open the thing. Why is she convinced this message is important enough to warrant becoming Dr. Mengele? Who knows? But what this ahem plot divergence does do is provide a new template for the FX team - inside Triss brain. Buildings become mobile glass flies everywhere hallucinations abound. On the acting front its impressive how the likes of Winslet Spencer and Watts can spout their required gobbledygook and still maintain conviction. But if Insurgent is simply Divergent with more violence and a few extra terabytes of computer-generated mayhem at least the denouement does hint that the plot will change course in the third instalment. Or maybe the fourth. Twitter jimslotek jim.sloteksunmedia.ca Readers comments >> By adding a comment on the site you accept our terms and conditions.

"Insurgent is slightly more urgent than Divergent review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesInsurgent is slightly more urgent than Divergent reviewIts best not to think too much about the dystopian youth sci-fi franchise The Divergent Series which in second chapter Insurgent feels slightly more urgent with its emphasis on action and familiar characters.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. March 19 2015The Divergent Series InsurgentStarring Shailene Woodley Theo James Kate Winslet Miles Teller Ansel Elgort Naomi Watts and Ashley Judd. Directed by Robert Schwentke. At GTA theatres. 119 minutes. PGThe Scrabble-champ names for the five fractious factions of The Divergent Series seem needlessly burdened.Erudite Dauntless Candor Abnegation and Amity -- who talks like this unless theyre looking for a triple word score? Lets just call the factions what they really are Brainiacs Bruisers Blowhards Big Hearts and Beatniks.Article Continued BelowBut its best not to think too much about this dystopian youth sci-fi franchise which in the second chapter Insurgent feels slightly more urgent.Theo James and Shailene Woodley star in The Divergent Series InsurgentFreed of the dull necessity of introducing main characters the film pushes its best assets rising stars Shailene Woodley Miles Teller Theo James and Ansel Elgort in that order. They all act their talented little hearts out which aint easy when youve got a committee-written script that is expressly designed to milk this overwrought story for all its worth.As rebel inhabitants of a fenced-in and fascistic Chicago of a postapocalyptic future theyre on the hoof from the genocidal power plays of Kate Winslets scheming Erudite leader Jeanine who has great fashion sense for a despot. She wants to rub out a small but influential band of nonconforming Divergents -- which here means ""dangerous free thinkers"" -- for fear they might upset the carefully controlled social order.Under the businesslike direction of franchise newcomer Robert Schwentke (Flightplan RED) and filmed in non-glorious UP3D (Utterly Pointless 3D) Insurgent has more action than last years debut film which was modestly titled just Divergent. Action is what you want in a picture such as this especially when you dont really have a lot on your mind.But lets not get carried away. The Divergent Series based on Veronica Roths trilogy of young adult novels still comes across as The Hunger Games lite although its considerable more verbose than that superior franchise -- yet paradoxically with less to say.When we last left our band of youthful renegades led by guilt-ridden Divergent poster girl Tris (Woodley) and her macho love interest Four (Theo James) they were on a train bound for something that looked like freedom. Insurgent soon reveals they got as far as Woodstock or rather an Amity hippie haven on the outskirts of Chicago. There Tris Four and fellow escapees Peter (Teller) and Caleb (Elgort) find something less than peace love and understanding from Amity leader Johanna (Octavia Spencer).Before they have time say ""Thats not very Amity of you"" theyre all in motion again. Jeanines stooges led by smirking Dauntless psychopath Eric (Jai Courtney) arrive bent on urban renewal by way of body removal.And so it goes on and off through the film. There are some great action set pieces especially a wild CG sequence -- is it real or fantasy? -- where Tris chases an airborne burning house containing a person of major significance. Theres also a tease of complications to come in the introduction not only of Spencers character but that of another newcomer Naomi Watts who is almost unrecognizable with brunette-dyed hair. Shes Evelyn kin to a key character and also a highly motivated member of the Factionless another band of upstarts who might be considered yet another faction if they werent er Factionless.The best addition to this saga though is a groovy glowing and glittering box of hidden knowledge that everybody is suddenly fighting over. It looks like something Apple is going to unveil at its next dog-and-pony show. I dont even know exactly what it does but I want one just like the iWatch.But for the most part Insurgent is built on staredowns takedowns and breakdowns with the various players talk talk talking about their situation like Scrabble players arguing over whether ""abnegation"" is really a word (it is I looked it up).Some of these yakkers are under the influence of a truth serum so they get a pass. Still with two more chapters of this story to come via the greedily split Allegiant the makers of this franchise had better up the ante considerably or even Scrabble fans might plead for deferment from Divergent.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Review Insurgent smartly gives the Divergent Tris room to run - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Insurgent smartly gives the Divergent Tris room to run Insurgent Andrew Cooper / Lionsgate ""Insurgent"" is set inside a future post-apocalypse Chicago where a new society has been formed by using personality traits to divide individuals into factions. Four (Theo James left) Peter (Miles Teller center) and Tris (Shailene Woodley right) star in the film. ""Insurgent"" is set inside a future post-apocalypse Chicago where a new society has been formed by using personality traits to divide individuals into factions. Four (Theo James left) Peter (Miles Teller center) and Tris (Shailene Woodley right) star in the film. (Andrew Cooper / Lionsgate) Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter Robert Schwentke takes over Insurgent and delivers a satisfyingly action-heavy grown-up sci-fi story When superhero franchises falter studios often reboot them starting over from a different perspective with a different cast. Whats happened with ""The Divergent Series Insurgent"" is less drastic but similar A successful series has kept its cast but been revamped in the middle of its run.That run began with ""Divergent"" director Neil Burgers respectful but tepid version of the first book in Veronica Roths hugely successful YA trilogy about a dystopian future where only teenagers in love have the moxie to challenge the establishment and reconstitute the world. Returning for the second film are Shailene Woodley and Theo James expertly cast as Tris and Four the trilogys indispensable couple. But director Burger has been replaced by Robert Schwentke and he has changed almost everything else.Gone are ""Divergents"" pair of screenwriters who stuck closely to the original book. In their place a new trio (Brian Duffield Akiva Goldsman Mark Bomback) has done serious surgery to ""Insurgent"" streamlining the story line changing key plot points inventing critical elements and in general improving the narrative flow. Though he did the romantic ""The Time Travelers Wife"" Schwentke is best-known for the geriatric secret agent movie ""RED"" and hes brought with him to ""Insurgent"" the key visual members of his ""RED"" team including cinematographer Florian Ballhaus production designer Alex Hammond and second unit director and visual effects supervisor James Madigan. Insurgent Naomi Watts on Evelyn and the universal themes in Divergent Tracy Brown Tracy Brown Together theyve made ""Insurgent"" into less of a youthful romance and more of an action-heavy science fiction story the kind of rat-a-tat tale that used to star grown-ups before teens ruled the box office. The result -- though admittedly its a low bar to clear -- is a more effective adult-friendly film than its predecessor.In case youre new to the series or have just plain forgotten ""Insurgent"" is set inside a future post-apocalypse Chicago where a new society has been formed by using personality traits to divide individuals into factions named Abnegation Amity Candor Dauntless and Erudite. Those who fit nowhere like our Tris are Divergent and much feared. Video Trailer The Divergent Series Insurgent Watch the trailer for ""The Divergent Series Insurgent."" Watch the trailer for ""The Divergent Series Insurgent."" See more videos The last film ended with Jeanine (Kate Winslet) the ruthless leader of Erudite masterminding a plan to take control of society by murdering all the Abnegation individuals. Tris and her allies are blamed and the new film opens with them on the run. The group which includes snarky Peter (Miles Teller) takes refuge with the kindly Amity folks led by Johanna (Octavia Spencer). This faction is so genial the food servers tell everyone to ""Go with happiness"" making the whole place seem like a very large branch of the Cafe Gratitude franchise.Haunted by nightmares and guilt-ridden about deaths she feels responsible for Tris impulsively cuts off her hair giving herself a Jean Seberg look in preparation for the Joan of Arc-type battles that are to come.For though ""Insurgent"" cant quite do without its pro forma personal moments between characters (the film even includes a sex scene so chaste it wouldnt have disturbed Doris Day in her prime) its heart is not there but in its action sequences.Crisply conceived of and executed by Schwentke and his team of ""RED"" veterans these scenes are nothing if not traditional B-movie material. Tris and friends are chased through the forest by bad guys like partisans being pursued by Nazis attack squads deftly rappel down high walls and a brutal fight erupts on a wide-open railroad boxcar with heads dangling dangerously close to moving rails.But when those familiar exploits are combined with the rejiggered aspects of ""Insurgents"" plot effective pulp storytelling is the surprising result.For one thing it turns out that Fours mother Evelyn kind of like Hiccups mother Valka in ""How to Train Your Dragon 2"" is not dead but merely gone. As played by the protean Naomi Watts Evelyn reemerges as the leader of a powerful group of outcasts called the Factionless. Evelyn wants Jeanine dead but Four who has issues with his mother (who doesnt in these films?) is not sure she can be trusted.Meanwhile since evil never sleeps nefarious Jeanine has plans of her own. She has come into the possession of an ancient and mysterious pentagon (not in the book) which she assumes is some kind of weapon system that will help keep her in power. The only trouble is no one but a Divergent can figure out how to crack the code and open it up.A key part of ""Insurgents"" plot is a disturbing series of SIMs or simulations that Tris has to survive. More elaborate than the ones in the book -- and created by a combination of live-action stunts and post-production wizardry -- they are more fun to watch than to read about which come to think of it is the secret of this films success.------------------------The Divergent Series InsurgentMPAA rating PG-13 for intense violence and action throughout some sensuality thematic elements and brief languageRunning time 1 hour 59 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Reviews Entertainment Insurgent Mekhi Phifer on Maxs leadership in Divergent sequel Can Insurgent spark a male rebellion too?

Close Join the conversation... With Nancy Churnin Share This Story Share Discuss Meh The second film in a series poses challenges. You have to figure out how to bring fans up to speed without replaying the first part and decide whether youre even going to try to make it work for newcomers.Director Robert Schwentke makes smart choices that can work for both groups in Insurgent the second film adapted from Veronica Roths popular Divergent trilogy.Some fans may object to substantial plot alterations but the rejiggering streamlines and intensifies the story as it powers to the same destination.Others may feel a little Hunger Games fatigue about the vulnerable young woman warrior who is the only one who can save her post-apocalyptic world from totalitarian forces.Still Shailene Woodley is an eloquent young actress and her penetrating look at Tris inner world makes for compelling viewing. The use of nightmares and simulations sprinkled throughout the story reflects Tris ambivalence about herself as she struggles with guilt over whether theres something innate that causes the carnage around her.As we learn from the first book and film Tris lives in a world where everyone is separated into one of five factions Erudite for the intellectuals Candor for the honest Abnegation for the selfless Amity for the kind Dauntless for the brave. She is one of the suspect few who overlap with more than one group making her divergent. In this image released by Lionsgate Theo James from left Shailene Woodley and Miles Teller appear in a scene from ""The Divergent Series Insurgent."" Andrew Cooper/AP In the books divergence makes her dangerous to Jeanine the leader of the Erudite chillingly played in the films by Kate Winslet.In this variation from the book that also makes her Jeanines desired tool as only someone who is divergent can open a box she stole that contains a record of their founders true intentions.Taking over for Neil Burger who directed the first film Schwentke evokes a city with different looks for each faction from rural Amity to futuristic Erudite and ravaged Dauntless. His focus however is less on physical surroundings than on Tris and the suggestion of twists yet to turn with Four and his mother Evelyn played by Naomi Watts as the secretive leader of the factionless who may have her own agenda.Miles Teller provides the closest thing to comic relief as Peter a peer with fluid allegiances although he does veer close to breaking suspension of disbelief by lifting a questioning eyebrow at some of the characters less than logical choices. Ansel Elgort fares less well as Tris brother Caleb who comes off as unlikably opaque.The film however belongs to Tris and her struggles with accepting herself. On that level it satisfies while opening the door to the third of the four films scheduled to complete the series. INSURGENT (B)Directed by Robert Schwentke.

By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com March 19 2015 202 p.m. ET Its tempting to say that ""Insurgent"" the long-unawaited--at least by me--sequel to ""Divergent"" is less resurgent than regurgent which may not be a proper word but still suggests throwing up more of the same. Yet this sci-fi action adventure the second screen adaptation of Veronica Roths ""Divergent"" series goes beyond the same-old lame-old tedium of the first film. ""Insurgent"" opens new horizons of repetitiveness dramatic shapelessness self-seriousness and a generalized oppressiveness that flows from all of the above as well as from visual clutter cheerless color 3-D dimness and plain old bad acting. ...

Who gets to measure the greater good? How many trippy visual effects can be stuffed into one movie?These and other weighty questions are at the center of ""Insurgent"" the perilously convenient second film in the ""Divergent"" franchise which while far from perfect has a crackling energy that cant be denied. Most of the credit for that has to go to star Shailene Woodley who has a wonderful knack for making even the most unreal moments seem real.""Insurgent"" is the second installment in the ""Divergent"" franchise which can easily and rightfully be seen as a poorer cousin of ""The Hunger Games."" Both series center on young women bringing an unjust future society to its knees while dealing with young love family and the question of whats next.But the scrambled busy convolutions of ""Divergent"" make ""The Hunger Games"" look downright elegant. Woodley stars as Tris a young woman growing up in the ruins of Chicago where society has been broken into a handful of factions each serving a specific purpose and balancing the others.In the first film Tris opted to join the quasi-military Dauntless faction even though she knew she was actually a Divergent - a rare person with traits from all factions. When the leader of the brainy Erudite faction Jeanine (Kate Winslet) tried to wipe out Dauntless and take over all the factions Tris got in the way.As ""Insurgent"" opens Tris her boyfriend Four (Theo James) her reticent Erudite brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) and a weaselly tag-along Peter (Miles Teller) have all taken refuge outside the city with the pacifist agrarian faction. But Jeanine has uncovered some sort of magic box - this is the sort of series where magic boxes suddenly show up - that only a Divergent can open. So she sends her storm troopers out to find one.This gets Triss group running again. Miraculously they meet up with Fours long-thought-to-be-dead mother Evelyn (Naomi Watts) the leader of an underground movement of misfits. Eventually Tris realizes she needs to have a showdown with Jeanine because well Jeanine is just plain evil.All of which sounds terribly awkward but somehow isnt a lot of the time. Director Robert Schwentke keeps the visuals mostly dazzling - as in the first film Tris has a number of induced hallucinations - but hes wise enough to realize the movie is all on Woodley (the camera rarely leaves her) and shes more than capable especially with her new can-do short haircut of pulling it off.It helps that shes surrounded by talent. Watts - joining the club of Great Actors in young adult fantasies that includes Winslet Julianne Moore Philip Seymour Hoffman and others - doesnt have much to do but she does it very well. Winslet is icy perfection. And the producers must be thrilled they signed up meteoric talents Teller and Elgort before they caught fire.Most of the storys weaknesses and clumsy turns come from the original novels written by Veronica Roth although a trio of screenwriters have smoothed many of the ragged edges. Schwentke has to rely on a fairly relentless pace to run right over some of the silliness although the films just-in-the-nick-of-time climax is fairly laughable.Still the action sequences are well done some of the visuals are spectacular and at its heart ""Insurgent"" is wrestling with some very basic questions about ambition and human interaction. In the long run this franchise will always play second fiddle to ""The Hunger Games"" but at least it has a fiddle to play.TLongdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/toomuchTomLongInsurgentGRADE B-Rated PG-13 for intense violence and action throughout some sensuality thematic elements and brief languageRunning time119 minutesCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1MLXtAX MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/columnists/tom-long/2015/03/18/uneven-energetic-insurgent-relies-woodley/25003073/,200,thedivergentseriesinsurgent18,thedivergentseriesinsurgent,detroitnews

The rules of the world--which are jammed into the first five minutes like Kate Winslets broadcast announcement here--have been established in the first film and theres really no point in complaining about them. The rules are the rules even if the tenets of that post-apocalyptic society like in Veronica Roths Divergent series happen to be kind of dumb. Yes the so-simple-its-confusing social structure of future Chicago has returned for Insurgent along with its five personality-based factions Dauntless (tough) Erudite (smart but mostly evil) Amity (peaceful earth-tone-loving) Candor (honest and stylish) and Abnegation (selfless). Just to make matters more confusing there are the people who fit into too many factions Divergents and the people who dont fit into any the Factionless. Thankfully with this system already explained (ad nauseam) in Divergent the sequel doesnt spend too much time worried about the specifics of why Tris (Shailene Woodley) and Four (Theo James) are on the run from Jeanine (Winslet) or why they want to kill her. Thats just whats happening. Taken for what it is Insurgent is a vast improvement over the franchises first installment mostly thanks to expansion in two arenas budget and scope. Often the two are one and the same as the action moves from the handful of cheap-looking Dauntless sets to the rather complex built-out worlds of the other factions. The straightforward dialogue scenes never last too long explicitly laying out everyones motivations and carrying us through to the next action sequence--each of which gets some serious help from Robert Schewentke whose direction feels downright masterful compared to the fights in Divergent. But most of the credit belongs to Woodley. She is undoubtedly one of the finest young actors working right now and appears to be much more comfortable here than in the first movie. One scene in particular forces Tris to publicly and emotionally expose herself and the entirety of the sequences weight rests squarely on Woodleys shoulders (or her face I guess). Its an amazing feat of acting. In a single take she makes the audience believe--even if just for a moment--that hidden beneath the silly faction system and the ridiculous things Kate Winslet is forced to say there is at least one real person in this story.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert The Young Adult dystopia derby races on. This week ""Insurgent"" moves ahead as the front-runner in action sequences while ""Mockingjay"" retains its lead in spoken romantic interludes. Will Tris and her five divided ""factions"" soon seize bomb-scarred postwar Chicago? Or can Katniss cross the finish line first with her District 13 rebellion against the power elite in glamorous Panem? Will those lioness roars from Katniss top Tris Tinkerbell whispers? At this point the adaptations of Veronica Roths adolescent ""Divergent"" novels and Suzanne Collins ""Hunger Games"" are near-duplicates in all but the smallest details. Oppressive governments forced the heroines of each series to enter a homogeneous social cult. (Tris hardly fits as shes a ""Divergent"" a rare mixed breed with equal amounts of intelligence bravery compassion honesty and sacrifice.) Each is a defiant girl who has broken free from her bloc joining a fearsome rebellion against the ruling class. Both fight a bit through arguments and a whole lot with science fiction weaponry. Each pursues romance with someone facing difficulties like their own. At least Tris (played by the eternally watchable Shailene Woodley) gets hunkier eye candy and hotter kisses. When the fighting pauses she and warlike love interest Four (Theo James) cross into more interesting territory. In private. Wearing much less combat gear. No wonder Woodley and James won the Favorite Movie Duo award at this years teenage Peoples Choice Awards. To many teenage viewers their kissing and cuddling will top the series repeated views of its characters jumping aboard speeding trains. Woodley was also nominated for the same prize with her other ""Divergent"" co-star Ansel Elgort. Girl has skills. In this chapter totalitarian leader Jeanine Matthews (Kate Winslet meaner than the Nazi war criminal she played in ""The Reader"") aims to force Tris to open an impenetrable trunk concealing information about their societys future. In her second outing as Tris Woodley proves she can work her way through plausible fight scenes yet maintain control of the familiar character. At 23 she passes perfectly for a 17- or 18-year-old not just with her porcelain features but through a sense of emotional sincerity most futuristic kid-oriented genre films lack. Whether she is hiding peacefully alongside Amish-style vegetarians at the beginning feeling heartbreaking personal loss or falling to earth from rocket-scarred Chicago skyscrapers she stays sharply focused. Director Robert Schwentke delivers all the storys loud heavy glass-smashing fight scenes with the force of a gut-slammed buzz saw. Woodleys plentiful action scenes grow until near the climax she leaps through giant windows and across the skyline like Spider-Mans big sister. Despite such ludicrous moments she helps give the film a fine artistic sheen. The Divergent Series Insurgent 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for intense violence and action some sensuality thematic elements and brief language. Shes not the only skilled actress in the cast. Naomi Watts steps in as a dangerous frenemy but Woodley is hard to steal a scene from. In long handsomely framed close-ups Schwentke recognizes her ability to raise the bar in every shot translating random dialogue into tidbits of poetry. Whether shes furious for revenge or pensively melancholy about her late familys suffering you feel for her too. Woodley understands how to be heroic and tough at the same time. Near the climax where shes pushed into a rock-em-sock-em fight with her identical equal I liked her so much in each role I hoped both would win. Watch out Katniss your competition is hard as nails.

The story takes place in a postapocalyptic Chicago where society has been divided into five tribes based on personality type; the teenage protagonist (Shailene Woodley) is unclassifiable which makes her an outlaw (and a hero to any adolescent reader). Having led an insurrection against the rigid social order in the first movie she spends much of the second captured by the societys merciless overlord (Kate Winslet) and locked into a psychoactive contraption that subjects her to various traumatic hallucinations. Any movie critic can relate to that. Robert Schwentke (R.I.P.D.) directed; with Theo James Miles Teller and Naomi Watts. By J.R.

VPCShailene Woodley again shines as Tris now on the run from a power-mad leader (Kate Winslet). Not a great movie but an improvement upon the first.Tris (Shailene Woodley) must keep a step ahead of the Erudites who are out to kill her in ""Insurgent.""(Photo Lionsgate)Story HighlightsYet another young-adult tale of a dystopian future the second film improves upon the first.Teller is outstanding in a small role. Woodley is always good.Critics rating 3 starsHeres an interesting premise for a movie Imagine a dystopian near-future where humanitys greed and violence and general inability to get along has finally overtaken reason and good sense -- no this is not a session of Congress -- and the world lies in ruins.Various methods are tried to turn things around most of them brutal and ultimately lethal but in the end a young man or woman must lead mankind to a better future.Oh. Wait. We already have ""The Hunger Games"" and ""The Maze Runner"" and coming to a theater near you the second installment in the ""Divergent"" series.Its called ""Insurgent"" and though its better than the first movie theres still a sameness to these stories. Theyre based on best-selling young-adult novels and although the books come in threes the movies tend to come in fours splitting the last book into two films to double the box-office take.Interview Keiynan Lonsdale dances into ""Insurgent""Luckily for ""Insurgent"" Shailene Woodley is on board for the duration (much as Jennifer Lawrence is for ""The Hunger Games"" franchise). This makes the movies vastly more appealing than they otherwise would or should be.We met Tris (Woodley) in the first film. In this version of the future post-war Chicago is a walled-off city whose residents are split into five factions Erudite (smart) Amity (chummy agrarians) Candor (brutally honest) Dauntless (reckless and brave) and Abnegation (self-sacrificing).Tris is the rare Divergent -- a person who doesnt fit into any of the categories. She and her trainer and eventual boyfriend Four (Theo James) who also is Divergent fought against an Erudite takeover of the government (Abnegation was running things) led by the scheming Jeanine (Kate Winslet); Tris parents and other Abnegation members are killed.But hey She got a boyfriend.When the second film begins Tris Four Tris brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) and her competitor Peter (Miles Teller) are hiding out among Amity folks led by Johanna (Octavia Spencer). Tris shears her hair and she hopes some of the crushing guilt she feels for the death of her parents and others but its obvious its going to take more to absolve her of that.Jeanine is now fully in control of the city and she is hunting down Divergents in part because she thinks they pose a threat but also because she has found a box that only a Divergent can unlock. She thinks it contains a message that will explain and justify her brutal methods to the cowering citizenry.As with ""The Hunger Games"" the hows and whys are a little muddled. We also meet Evelyn (Naomi Watts) who leads the Factionless a band of misfits kind of like Divergents but meaner. Its all building up to the enormous set piece in which in order to open the box Tris must endure five simulations or sims in virtual reality. Heres where director Robert Schwentke earns his keep. The trippy scenes leave reality behind even as the consequences for Tris are real and dangerous.Such is the state of young-adult pop culture that Woodley has played the young lover of both Teller (""The Spectacular Now"") and Elgort (""The Fault in Our Stars""). Its like a traveling company of attractive young people. And although Woodley is again good the smarmy smirking Teller -- who has said he does these as a cash grab -- is outstanding in a small role. More of him would have made a better movie.Oh well. At least his presence along with Woodleys makes ""Insurgent"" good if not great. And its not too late to keep improving. Theres always next time. And the time after that. And if it doesnt work out in the ""Divergent"" series we can all take comfort in the fact that someone somewhere is writing another series of novels about a bleak future with swoon-worthy characters saving the day. Lets hope Teller and Woodley dont age out of these kinds of roles before its done.Insurgent3 stars (out of 5) Director Robert SchwentkleCast Shailene Woodley Ansel Elgort Theo James.Rating PG-13 for intense violence and action throughout some sensuality thematic elements and brief language.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Updated July 30 2016  253 pm Full Forecast News Sports Business Go Life Buy/Sell Movie reviews Zero stars The Divergent Series Insurgent is incoherent drivel By Joe Williams / film critic / joewilliamspost-dispatch.com Joe Williams Mar 19 2015 (...) Consider the numeral zero. Its not exactly a number which measures a finite amount but a concept that means nothingness.For the past decade the movie reviews in these pages have used a scale of one to four stars. A one-star rating is supposed to represent the lowest of the low. But after suffering and then sleeping through ""The Divergent Series Insurgent"" your humble correspondent had an awakening There is such a thing as an infinitely bad movie and this is it.Many movies are inept yet some of them are entertaining. From ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" to ""Showgirls"" badly scripted poorly acted and sloppily directed movies can be forgiven if they have compensatory virtues like Bela Lugosi or bare boobs. Or a story. Almost every mainstream Hollywood release has the pretense of a plot. Granted a lot of them are cliched but when were eating popcorn in the dark many sins can be forgiven if the people on the screen seem committed to what theyre doing.Theres no forgiving ""Insurgent"" a ransom note written in gibberish and delivered to a captive audience of pre-teen girls. Many of them have already read the book series by Veronica Roth so in the spirit of Amity they might give this misbegotten middle child the benefit of the doubt. But your humble correspondent belongs to a faction called Candor and from his middle-age male perspective this is the most crassly contrived movie he has ever seen.In episode one which was a shameless imitation of ""The Hunger Games"" without all that annoying social-commentary stuff a mousy girl named Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley) discovered that she wasnt just another rat in the maze of post-apocalyptic Chicago but a ""divergent"" with special powers. So she broke from her genetically prescribed role and joined with a brigade of freedom-fighting daredevils. God help you if you dont know the backstory entering this second installment. Even when uttered by an authority figure played by Kate Winslet all the malarkey about personality-based factions boils down to a stink-face feud between specialists (Abnegation Erudite Dauntless) and multi-taskers (Divergents). Why should anyone who doesnt belong to the faction Consumer care about a struggle between various tribes of tattooed teens?Should we be terrified when Tris is captured and forced to endure computer-simulated hardships from the ""Martix""/""Inception"" playbook? Why shouldnt we laugh when she does the Marx Bros. mirror routine with her own dark side before realizing like Whitney Houston that the greatest love of all is narcissism? And must we really endure a third move to learn that shes the Chosen One? Woodley who was so lively in ""The Descendents"" eschews emotion as if she were the cancer patient in ""The Fault in Our Stars."" Her co-conspirator in that bathetic movie Ansel Elgort plays her brother here (ick) and some cardboard hunk named Theo James plays the token love interest. Were it not for the five lines of recognizably human dialogue spoken by Miles Teller this whole thing would implode into a black hole.Which is the only thing less than zero.What ""The Divergent Series Insurgent""  No stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 159  Content Intense violence and action throughout some sensuality thematic elements and brief language Joe Williams  314-340-8344Film criticjoethecritic on Twitterjoewilliamspost-dispatch.com Divergent movie doesnt disappoint Movie should satisfy fans of the Veronica Roth book.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it ""Insurgent"" is a sequel to the 2014 film ""Divergent"" starring Kate Winslet and Shailene Woodley. It raises the stakes for Tris (Woodley) as she is on the run and searches for answers in the ruins of a futuristic Chicago. (Lionsgate) By Michael OSullivan March 19 2015 ""Tell me Do you appreciate irony?"" Thats the question put to Tris (Shailene Woodley) the heroine of the latest installment in the ""Divergent"" film saga ""Insurgent"" by the films villain Jeanine. Rendered by Kate Winslet as a caricature of such steely intelligence that she looks like the product of a sheet-metal plant Jeanine doesnt mean it this way but her question highlights a central irony of the film. Its one thats even more prominent in this second chapter of the sci-fi trilogy -- which is set in a dystopian Chicago where people have been sorted like machine parts into five personality-based ""factions"" -- than it was in the first. The irony is this It is the Erudite the brainiac faction of which Jeanine is supreme leader that administers and defends this harebrained scheme. There Ive said it. The very foundation of the ""Divergent"" world is built upon the stupidest organizing principle ever. Whose cockamamie idea was it that all people can be classified by a narrow predilection for brains (Erudite) or heart (Amity) or bravery (Dauntless) or honesty (Candor) or self-sacrifice (Abnegation)? (And why no Comedy faction? Where do all the class clowns go?) Dont expect an answer in this movie; series author Veronica Roth didnt get around to figuring one out until the third book ""Allegiant"" which is being released as two separate films in 2016 and 2017. [Is ""Divergent"" better than the book? Believe it.] Four (Theo James) Peter (Miles Teller) and Tris (Shailene Woodley) return for the second movie in the ""Divergent"" series. (Andrew Cooper/Lionsgate) The mere presence of Divergents (people like Tris with affinity for more than one faction) not to mention the sizable underclass known as the Factionless (misfits who for one reason or another have flunked out of their designated cliques) should serve as a red flag that something isnt working. But never mind. The Kafkaesque absurdity of the situation is at least recognized by Tris if not by Jeanine. In response to a rebellion led by Tris and her boyfriend a fellow Divergent known as Four (Theo James) Jeanine has come to believe that the solution to what she calls the ""Divergent crisis"" is contained in a locked time capsule that has been left by the founders of this kooky world. Ironically the box can only be opened by a Divergent who is capable of completing a series of virtual-reality tests or simulations utilizing skills from each of the five factions. Paging Tris to the white courtesy phone. The most cinematic of these sims calling on Triss derring-do involves rescuing her mother (Ashley Judd) from a burning building that is flying through the air. And yes ""Divergent"" fans Mom did die in the last movie. The simulation is not real. (It is however the one and only reason to see this movie in Imax 3-D. The special effects in this scene look particularly good on a screen the size of my house.) Less effective is the films ability to make us care about any of this. Although Woodley is adequate at emoting -- Tris being something of a basket case of guilt self-loathing and teenage hormones -- many of the other characters here are by definition one-dimensional. ""Thank you for your candor"" chant the members of Candor like robots after administering a truth serum that forces Tris to confess to killing a friend in the first film. Talk about irony. ""Go with happiness"" is the mantra of the back-to-nature Amity faction whose members shuffle around morosely like members of an agrarian therapy group for depressives. There is however a certain urgency to the action that will prevent most people from noticing the films flaws. And there are several nice performances especially by Miles Teller returning as Triss Dauntless nemesis Peter and new cast member Naomi Watts playing Fours Machiavellian (and factionless) mother. Shifting loyalties and ambiguous motives keep the viewer off balance in a good way. Not so great is the way the film ends delivering a frustrating resolution -- yes the one contained in that lockbox -- that only deepens the mystery behind the crazy faction system. Rather than offering a teaser to the next film this lack of closure left me feeling like the waiter had whisked my plate away before I was finished. ""What now?"" Tris wonders aloud as ""Insurgent"" grinds to a premature halt. You know what sister? Ive been running alongside you for two movies now waiting for an answer to that question. But with two more years to the finish line Im running out of patience not to mention breath. PG-13. At area theaters.

Yet theres no escaping what it is and what it is ... is silly. The best thing to say for the film and this is no small thing is that ""Insurgent"" moves the story forward significantly. Even ""The Two Towers"" in Peter Jacksons ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy suffered from middle-book-itis a condition in which a story neither begins nor ends and thus leaves audiences unsatisfied. But ""Insurgent"" lands with a real sense of completion with one grand movement concluded and another about to begin. That dystopian visions of the future keep turning up onscreen these days probably says something about how people feel about the present but the ""Divergent"" series seems less like a futuristic nightmare than a metaphor for high school. The central idea is that 200 years from now in the blasted-out ruin of Chicago -- at least they left New York alone for once -- humanity has devised a rigid but functional way to keep the peace. It divides human beings into five groups based on personality type and each group lives in a separate enclave. The groups are Erudite (intellectuals) Abnegation (selfless individuals) Dauntless (warriors) Amity (peace lovers) and Candor (honest people). People who are Divergent have elements of all types and are considered dangerous. Others who fail to pass entrance training for one of the factions are the Factionless who live miserable lives of poverty and violence and are led by Naomi Watts whose role is a major plot point. Related Stories Quick evolution for Theo James of Insurgent Shailene Woodley shares bone broth breakfast drink recipe As a high school metaphor this makes some kind of sense the notion that there are jocks and nerds and hippies and people into student government but that some of the most promising kids dont fit in anywhere. But to extrapolate from this some grand vision of a future society is absurd on its face. For one thing dividing people into self-contained factions is a recipe for conflict not cooperation. Furthermore the idea that people with similar personalities will get along harmoniously contradicts what we all know. People with similar personalities often bang heads. Finally nobody is one thing. Everybody is ""divergent"" so the idea repeated again and again that divergent people are a special breed is a little ridiculous. In fact just about everything in ""Insurgent"" is ridiculous and the more the movie expands to show how the Candor people live and how the hippie-dippy Amity dwellers get along the harder it is to keep from groaning. Faced with this the actors and filmmakers do the one thing they can do. They commit to this world vision with religious intensity. ""Insurgent"" begins where ""Divergent"" left off. Tris (Shailene Woodley) her handsome boyfriend and fellow warrior Four (Theo James) and a group of their associates are on the run from the power-mad Erudite ruler (Kate Winslet) who wants to restore order by killing all the Divergents. But Tris wants to do more than survive. She wants to lead the revolution. If you want to make a million dollars write a teen novel in which a seemingly unremarkable teenage girl becomes the romantic obsession of an insanely handsome young man. (If you want to make a billion dollars give her two insanely handsome young men as in the ""Twilight"" series.) Like Bella Tris is just awesome but at least Woodley makes you half believe it with her unclouded aura. Looking at her is like looking into clear water. Much of the screen time in ""Insurgent"" is taken up with politics the efforts of Tris and Four to forge alliances and launch a coup but this makes for flat viewing. The world of the film is so far-fetched that the mechanics of its functioning are of no interest. Whats worse the behavior of the characters often goes against the movies own internal logic which is flimsy to begin with. Robert Schwentke brings a kind of brain-dead intensity to the calmer scenes a passionate fervor that admits no variety of humor except the unintentional. But he does much better in the big virtual sequences in which we see what Tris imagines as she is hooked up to a simulator. These are the best scenes in the movie its one claim to if not originality idiosyncrasy and it really helps ""Insurgent"" that the climactic sequence leans heavily in this virtual direction. ""Insurgent"" would be a much worse movie if the good parts were all at the beginning. But they are saved for the end and they leave the viewer with a feeling of ""Well that was OK"" even though most of it wasnt. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Were two films in to the kiddie-dystopia Divergent franchise and its still unclear if the sequels director three screenwriters eight producers and especially original novelist Veronica Roth have bothered to double-check a dictionary. Divergent and now this new sequel Insurgent tracks the monotone mishaps of Tris (Shailene Woodley) a very special girl. (Arent they all.) Tris continues to flail against a postapocalyptic city-state where all residents are divided at maturation into one of five biologically based clans Amity Abnegation Dauntless Candor and Erudite. Each group is assigned a job that kinda-sorta relates to their inborn personality The brave Dauntless make up the militia the peaceful Amity are er farmers. They are expected to marry their own and more often than not produce children like them.Outside of the system there is a sixth class made up of the homeless rather politely called ""Factionless"" who act indistinguishably from the Dauntless except that theyre allowed to dress like The Ramones. And then theres a seventh furtive faction who register positive for the traits of all five tribes classifying them as Divergent. One would think that people who combine the separate traits would be called Convergent but then one would be expecting the source material to exert the barest minimum effort.Film Details The Divergent Series Insurgent RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time119 min. More Info Trailer To amplify the confusion Abnegation means ""selfless"" according to the logic of the film except when it means ""forgiving"" and Amity means ""forgiving"" except when it means ""hippie."" Ignore that these five branches of career dont seem to add up to a functioning economy unless you believe that 20 percent of the world should be composed of lawyers aka clan Candor who are lauded for their honesty despite the fact that everyone else in the film also speaks in straightforward declaratives.Its all so muddled that when we experience a simulation test for all five groups half the time we cant even tell what the category is (even when you know the point of the film hinges on it).

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm The nicest thing you can say about Insurgent is that no one involved in the making of it would test positive for the intelligent Erudites but then author Roth has perhaps out of spite reframed smart as evil. Headed by the wicked Jeanine (Kate Winslet) the Erudites launch a witch hunt to ID and ghettoize -- or worse -- every hidden Divergent as she believes theyre responsible for the nuclear war that wiped out all life outside the citys gates. This allows new-to-the-series German director Robert Schwentke (Red R.I.P.D.) to hammer chords of Berlin 1938 with Winslets hair bleached an overdetermined shade of platinum. Meanwhile despite Jeanines quest to capture those slippery Divergents characters such as Tris brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) somehow switch castes three times without any bureaucrats raising an eyebrow.The previous film buried its incoherence in an athletic tale wherein Tris a girl born of Abnegation chooses to train with those Dauntless jocks and soon after discovers that shes Divergent -- and perhaps the only one who can bring down Jeanine. (Hooray for inborn exceptionalism? But uh isnt that the opposite of the films message that people should be equal?) Luckily Tris mentor and boyfriend Four (Theo James) is secretly Divergent too even though despite his supposed wisdom he has a giant back tattoo proclaiming his Divergence. The first film was dumb but Tris gym-mat tumbles with Four provided some distraction. Here their relationship consists of clenching one another by the forearm and grunting two portentous sentences without blinking. Theyre gray heroes in a gray world. For excitement occasionally a flock of black birds flies across the screen.Woodley favors serious and forthright roles which she performs as though shes trying to earn Employee of the Month. Shes more relaxed in movies such as The Descendants and The Spectacular Now which force her to take a break from saving the world and crack open a beer. Though shes damp with tears and sweat poor Woodley is shown no kindness by Insurgents script which refuses to let her display any of the positive traits her character is said to possess intelligence in particular. Tris simply charges ahead toward every telegraphed trap like a bull chasing a cape. ""Meathead"" characters such as Dauntless Peter (Miles Teller the only actor carving out moments of fun) outwit her time after time finally tsk-tsking ""I knew you were dumb but....""Even the plot throws up its hands. At several points in the script Terrible Things happen that threaten to destroy everything. Later these fears are tidily resolved off-screen or proven not to be threats at all. In the final act one character has a change of heart that leads to a twist -- which winds up changing absolutely nothing.Insurgent is so vapid it seems impossible that theres enough story left for another sequel yet the filmmakers have already budgeted the first movies 288.7 million haul for a third and fourth installment.

"Insurgent (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Insurgent (PG-13) The second chapter in the ""Divergent"" saga is a plodding run-up to the big finale. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle cogleMiamiHerald.com3/19/2015 Editor rating 2 Judging by its latest installment the Divergent movie franchise seems to be heading in the opposite direction of its dystopian cousin The Hunger Games. While both films deal with the adventures of a bold independent-minded heroine navigating the dangers of a post-apocalyptic future The Hunger Games films have improved steadily since the first in the series thanks to smart scripts solid direction and well-plotted source material. The same cant be said for the second film in the Divergent series which imagines a world carved into five distinct factions (those who dont fit into a group are outcasts doomed to scrounge for survival amid the ruins of the fenced-in city). Divergent presented this scenario with flair introducing us to Tris (Shailene Woodley) the girl from Abnegation who chose to be Dauntless but must hide the truth -- shes really Divergent harboring the talents of all five factions. Unfortunately Insurgent cant quite live up to its intriguing set up. Even if youre curious about it the movie is often plodding and frequently nonsensical with action that never feels novel or exciting. Theres a been-there done-that feel as well as the sense that were in a bit of a holding pattern at times awaiting the trippy surprise ending which sets the course for the rest of the series. In Insurgent which picks up a few days after the final events of Divergent Tris and her Dauntless tutor/dreamboat boyfriend Four (Theo James) have escaped the brutal forces led by Jeanine (a chilly forbidding Kate Winslet). Jeanine is the leader of Erudite faction which has decided to wrest control of the government from Abnegation (charged with leadership because theyre selfless). Novelist Veronica Roth may or may not be aware that shes equating intelligence with evil by portraying the smartest people in this society as cold-hearted violent villains but never mind that. Erudite wants to rule and rule it shall. So Tris and Four and a handful of others -- including Tris brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort of The Fault In Our Stars) and her Dauntless nemesis Peter (Miles Teller of Whiplash) -- go on the run (but first Tris gives herself a four-star makeover despite the lack of hair product or decent lighting). They try hiding with the hippie-like peace-loving farmers of Amity then move on to the sleek Candor faction where the rest of their Dauntless pals are hanging out. Why Tris and Four think hiding with Candor -- known for always telling the truth -- is a good idea is not explained. But then again theyre Dauntless which means theyre reckless and brave but maybe not particularly logical. Of course Tris isnt really Dauntless; shes Divergent and a deadly threat to this way of life. Like it did in the first film this concept remains murky at the films start -- why would people with multiple talents be so dangerous you wonder? Wouldnt they actually be useful in a such a bombed-out limited society? Fear not. Insurgent addresses this question in a satisfying way but youll have to wade through some unnecessary fights and chases and psychological mumbo jumbo to get to the answer. In the meantime Jeanine is determined to force Tris to turn herself in so she can perform a deadly experiment. Tris is tormented by the deaths in the first film but mostly by the fact that her true self seems more violent than she would like. Understandable sure but did this inner struggle have to be framed as a physical confrontation with herself part of a series of tests she must pass? Part of the problem with such sequences is that theyre presented as simulations. We know it and Tris knows it. Insurgent makes a stab at trickery to create a bit more drama but what Tris must do to pass each test is so obvious you have to wonder how she could possibly fail knowing full well the scenario is a simulation. Fortunately Insurgent ends on a mysterious and intriguing note. If you dont know where Roth is headed and what lies in store for Tris Four and the rest youll be interested in Allegiant Parts 1 and 2. Yes the final novel will be split in two parts a strategy that worked so well for The Hunger Games and Harry Potter. Heres hoping it can inject more energy and creativity into this series.

EntertainmentMovies Insurgent Heroine gets tangled up in plot lines Originally published March 19 2015 at 1205 am A movie review of ""Insurgent"" Shailene Woodley Theo James and Kate Winslet return in this second installment of the dystopian series which picks up right where ""Divergent"" left off. Rating 2 stars out of 4. Share story By Soren AndersenSpecial to The Seattle Times ""Insurgent"" is like a private communication between fans of Veronica Roths best-selling series of young-adult novels and the filmmakers who have adapted the second book in that series to the big screen. By that I mean if you havent read ""Insurgent"" and more importantly havent seen ""Divergent"" -- the 2014 picture that preceded it (or read the book from which its derived) -- you wont have the faintest idea whats going on in this movie. Thats because ""Insurgent"" picks up right where ""Divergent"" left off and without knowledge of the backstory -- and ""Divergent"" is all backstory -- youll be lost lost lost. As the novels (there are three) have sold multiple millions of copies and as ""Divergent"" earned close to 289 million worldwide last year clearly theres a big audience for Roths tales of a dystopian future set in a ruined Chicago. But for moviegoers who dont belong to its core constituency its as if a big sign proclaiming ""Outsiders Not Welcome"" has been posted at the gates of this particular dystopia. Movie Review    Insurgent with Shailene Woodley Theo James Kate Winslet Octavia Spencer. Directed by Robert Schwentke from a screenplay by Brian Duffield Akiva Goldsman and Mark Bomback based on a novel by Veronica Roth. 118 minutes. Rated PG-13 for intense violence and action throughout some sensuality thematic elements and brief language. Several theaters. As it happens I have read the novel and seen ""Divergent"" -- twice -- and yet still found ""Insurgent"" barely comprehensible. Most Read StoriesThinking of voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson?

In the rigidly segmented society imagined by Roth the populace is divvied up into Amity folks (think crunchy-granola hippie peaceniks) Candor (honest to a fault) Abnegation (caring self-sacrificing souls) Dauntless (warriors) and Erudite (brainiacs/overlords). Tris fits no set mold. Shes Divergent evincing the personality traits of several of the so-called factions. Think of her as a free thinker. Think of her as a rebel. Jeanine thinks of her as a threat to the futures social order and wants her and others of her ilk eliminated. Alliances are formed. Erudite Jeanine joins forces with evil Dauntless elements. Meanwhile Tris (herself trained as a Dauntless) amp; Co. seek sanctuary with the Amityites and later try to ally with the Candors and also those who have fallen through societys cracks called Factionless and good-guy Dauntless elements. Got all that? Seemingly the hope of the future Tris is a basket case wracked by guilt over the violent deaths of loved ones (mother father good friend) for which she feels responsible. Woodley does the best she can with the role but the woe-is-me aspects of the character overwhelm everything else and make her not particularly sympathetic. Betrayals and double-crosses and nick-of-time rescues abound. Bizarre psychological tortures are enthusiastically inflicted by Jeanine balefully played by Winslet in a performance thats as constricted as the tight blue dress she wears throughout the picture. ""Will someone please tell me whats going on?"" Tris cries at one point and she could be speaking for the audience as the plot becomes ever more muddled. Bottom line for hard-core fans only.

CAST Shailene Woodley Theo James Kate Winslet LENGTH 158 It was bound to happen Tris the misfit girl who battled a post-apocalyptic regime in ""Divergent"" has developed survivors guilt. Played once again by Shailene Woodley Tris is haunted by dead loved ones in her dreams. As one ghost puts it ""You killed us all."" Thats the internalized theme of ""The Divergent Series Insurgent"" the second in a four-film franchise based on Veronica Roths novels. It doesnt ring true but it serves two purposes. Its a narcissistic fantasy that allows Tris to play the reluctant messiah and it adds the illusion of gravitas to a movie whose plot is purely mechanical. advertisement | advertise on newsday ""Insurgent"" finds former military elites Tris and Four (Theo James) bouncing between their societys ""factions."" Chased by the Dauntless army (led by an excellent Jai Courtney as Eric) they hide with the peaceful Amity farmers (Octavia Spencer plays their leader Johanna) argue with the honest Candor attorneys and finally join the Factionless renegades led by a slippery Naomi Watts as Evelyn. Their common enemy is Jeanine an Erudite usurper played by Kate Winslet with ice-cold eyes and a knowing smile. With its calculated script and clunky direction by Robert Schwentke (replacing Neil Burger) ""Insurgent"" feels like a prime-time soap full of big reveals character kill-offs and some unzippered bodily contact between Tris and Four. James continues to shine in a shallow role though the show-stealer is Miles Teller (""Whiplash"") as the swaggering turncoat Peter. Ansel Elgort returns as Tris wimpy brother Caleb. Despite some fine performances from an appealing cast ""Insurgent"" wont help this series escape the shadow of ""The Hunger Games."" Woodley has everygirl appeal but lacks the magnetism of that franchises star Jennifer Lawrence. The overall production also seems smaller less ambitious. The costumes are standard-issue gear and the futuristic technology doesnt impress (though in fairness thats getting harder to do these days). The climactic set pieces in which Tris runs a gauntlet of virtual-reality scenarios are created largely with CGI. 224 MoviesInsurgent trailer Although the ""Hunger Games"" movies havent lived up to their potential as political allegory the ""Divergent"" series hardly bothers with such ideas. Tris Four and their brethren exist in what is basically a giant sci-fi high-school where the final exams are deadly. This franchise may be more honest about its intention to entertain but its also far less interesting.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Shailene Woodleys open empathetic screen presence has served her well as Hollywoods go-to embodiment of the young-adult-novel heroine. From the more grounded likes of The Spectacular Now and The Fault In Our Stars to dystopian sci-fi like Divergent and its new sequel Insurgent the twentysomething Woodley wears the now-standard half-decade playing 18-year-olds better than most. One of the few new wrinkles Insurgent adds to Woodleys career is the chance to see her embody someone whos become radicalized--and at times almost bloodthirsty. Steeliness comes naturally to say Jennifer Lawrence but when Woodley unleashes the occasional voice-cracking battle cry it generates tension between her desire for revolution and her utter believability as a teenager with more earnest ideals than ruthless training. The movie picks up shortly after Divergent with Tris and company on the run from nefarious leader Jeanine (Kate Winslet) hiding out in Amity one of the five personality-based factions--along with Dauntless Candor Abnegation and leading class Erudite--that Tris has transcended with her divergence (which is not the same as being factionless yet another group in this classification-heavy future). The brief pause for plot regrouping also serves as a crash course in Woodleys IMDB listing as she shares a few scenes with all three of her major on-screen love interests at once. Ansel Elgort from The Fault In Our Stars plays Tris brother Caleb; Miles Teller from The Spectacular Now plays her frenemy Peter; and Theo James from Divergent plays Four whose continued romance with Tris makes the lukewarm wartime flirtations between Katniss Everdeen and Gale look positively simmering. (Fours big emotional moment admitting that hes fallen for her after the Candor faction administers a dose of truth serum.)Insurgent cant make any strategic adjustments for the better chemistry Woodley shares with her other co-stars especially in an adaptation climate that prizes fidelity to popular books above all else. So her dull pairing with James sticks while Teller and Elgort get stuck too more or less repeating their characters arcs from the first movie with minor variations. Its a particular shame for Teller who cant suppress his natural charisma even (or especially) when hes in jerk mode. Most of the movies too-few intentional laughs come from Teller appearing in the edge or background of the frame poking at the movies seriousness and stealing focus even when hes out of it. There are plenty more overqualified supporting cast members alongside Teller including Winslet Naomi Watts and Octavia Spencer. Their grounding presence has promise as do the loopy sci-fi conceits on display when Tris and Four try to rally other factions to their rebellious cause jumping from the smugness of Candor to the rail-riding hobo scrappiness of the Factionless. The personality-based factions barely make sense even as fable but they contain faint glimmers of the cheerful ridiculousness of comic sci-fi like Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy or Futurama. They remain only glimmers because this is a beloved YA property. The material cant simply be mined for parts; it must be respected.Just keeping a straight face though cant turn a divergent into a mockingjay. Despite its overtures toward thought-provoking sci-fi The Divergent Series as Insurgent is prefaced in the advertisements is actually more akin to Screen Gems franchises like Resident Evil or Underworld only not as stylish. ""Not as stylish"" is more or less the calling card of director Robert Schwentke (taking over for the similarly semi-slick Neil Burger) whose camera makes the occasional swoop or track but never takes any sustained technical or narrative risks. Insurgent has more action than Divergent but not much more excitement. Perhaps a more mercenary blockbuster mentality could have at least shaped that action into stronger set pieces.Theres certainly room for more trippiness than the movies constant shattered-glass and scattering-crows imagery allow because around a quarter of the running time consists of dream sequences and virtual-reality ""sims"" that test (and after the first movie re-test) Tris and her magical ability to have multiple personality traits. In its back half Insurgent becomes sort of a poor mans Matrix Reloaded including its indulgence in bloodless gun battles and mythology-changing revelations but jettisoning any passion conviction and striking visuals. The Wachowskis may overreach but they do so with commitment. Despite Woodleys best efforts Insurgent stays as bloodless as its violence.

"Insurgent review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review Insurgent Trailer The Divergent Series Insurgent Watch the trailer for ""The Divergent Series Insurgent."" Watch the trailer for ""The Divergent Series Insurgent."" Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune A slight improvement over the first ""Divergent"" movie. The futures grim by the way. Chicago has never looked less toddlin than it does in ""Insurgent"" the second of four planned movies to be pulled taffylike out of the hugely popular Veronica Roth trilogy. At one point our fierce yet humble dystopian world saver Tris Prior played by the fierce but humble franchise saver Shailene Woodley strolls beneath rusted bridges along the dried-up remains of the Chicago River. I knew that St. Patricks Day dye wasnt safeI kid. I kid the post-apocalypse. It is no laughing matter and very little in ""Insurgent"" beyond Miles Tellers and Ansel Elgorts subtle covetousness of the leading male role taken by Theo James is at all humorous. When Teller and Elgort signed on to ""Divergent"" their careers held great promise. Since then theyve both headlined various films of their own Elgort co-starring with Woodley in ""The Fault in Our Stars"" and Teller lately of ""Whiplash"" acting opposite Woodley in ""The Spectacular Now."" To see these guys in ""Insurgent"" doing what they can largely by way of a series of shifty reaction shots while the stars carry the ball is to see probable professional envy put to crafty use. From the spectacular now weve landed once again in the miserable future and a world where everyones divided up into rigid subsocieties based on personality and temperament. Its like a flash-mob remake of ""The Breakfast Club."" Kate Winslet returns as the icy blond authority figure crucial to every dystopian young adult story. Martial law rules the day and the characters played by Woodley James Elgort and Teller are on the run wondering how to start the revolution as effectively as possible.Winslets Jeanine needs a Divergent to unlock a mysterious box (not the Tesseract; thats another story) containing a message from the founders of the ""faction system"" that has brought us to where we are now Chicago centuries hence when things are rotten but theres plenty of free parking. At last. Director Robert Schwentke who has made some entertaining hokum (""Flightplan"") and some duds (""R.I.P.D."") proves simpatico with the increased levels of on-screen violence in this second installment of the ""Divergent"" series. A rooftop ambush sequence rates as more urgent and exciting than anything in the first picture and although absolutely nothing original occurs in the storytelling the chase scenarios and virtual-reality simulation scenes are plentiful and confidently realized.Woodleys Tris struggles with her guilt regarding the death of her parents; the consequences of her mad killing skills; and her love (doomed? not doomed?) for the daring young man with the flying tattoos played by James. Woodleys diffident insolent air has an intriguing way of filling out the lungs of her character. Teller whose presence you also appreciate has the benefit of playing a two-faced weasel established as such in the first movie. Naomi Watts shows up as the estranged insurrectionist mother of our heroines boyfriend. Latest movies reviewedOpen link Octavia Spencer gets a scene or two too portraying the benevolent leader of the peace-loving Amity faction. These early scenes are the only ones in ""Insurgent"" that are unintentionally funny; the way the agrarian vaguely Amish compounds laid out far from the city and the way these people are costumed it resembles a summer stock barn theater rehearsing back-to-back productions of ""Plain and Fancy"" and ""Godspell.""To recap The actors are more or less saving this franchises bacon. ""Insurgent"" is a tick or two livelier than the first one. Director Schwentke has already begun work on the forthcoming ""Allegiant Part One"" due next March.

After three Hunger Games movies plus a bunch of Twilight forestry escapades one Maze Runner (with more to come) and that dawdling sylvan interlude in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 the yawning YA genre packs its young audiences off to another Teen Boot Camp. Tris Prior the flinty heroine played by Shailene Woodley goes rural in Insurgent the second episode in the inevitable four-part trilogy now called The Divergent Series. (Four-part because no matter how fashions change in semi-blockbuster franchises the one unyielding Hollywood principle is greed.) Given the modest surprise of last years Divergent -- whod have guessed that the nth YA retread could be so ... O.K.? -- Insurgent has two hurdles to scale building on the promise of the first film and permanently anointing Woodley as the industrys ferocious deadpan goddess. The picture comes up short in both categories. Its wandering not urgent while indicating that all-Shailene-all-the-time can be too much of a pretty good thing. Sign up for THE BRIEF and more view example Divergent directed by Neil Burger displayed an admirable seriousness and some grim verve in laying out the boundaries of novelist Veronica Roths dystopia -- six segregated but ostensibly harmonious regions defined by their inhabitants skills. Latecomers can apply the mnemonic device FACADE Factionless for the outsiders Amity for the famers Candor for the truthsayers Abnegation for the selfless Dauntless for the daring and Erudite for the smarties. The first film had the benefit of being new -- newish given the familiarity of movies about kids getting hazed by ruthless adults -- in picturing Tris emergence through those worlds into her own unique entity. She is not just a Divergent the blending of several factions but The Divergent. Neo from The Matrix. The Redeemer. The One. In pop-culture terms Michael Jackson at his ""Billie Jean"" apogee. In liberal politics sort of Obama 2008. Insurgent directed by Robert Schwentke has Tris grappling with her superstar status and battling the powerful forces who might well be rid of her -- all women in Roths full-fledged matriarchy. (Has any modern or ancient trilogy been so bereft of father figures?) Among the adversaries and potential allies are the queens of three other realms Erudites Jeanine (Kate Winslet) Amitys Johanna (Octavia Spencer) and Evelyn (Naomi Watts) rebel warrior of the Factionless. In her own generation Tris also has to gauge the shifting loyalties of her brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) her Candor pal Christina (Zoe Kravitz) and the snide mercurial Peter (Miles Teller) while relying on her studly protector Four (Theo James). Having to arch up with all these characters propels Tris on a grand tour of her old haunts; with its repeat itinerary Insurgent is less a sequel than a remake. The movie has an ordinary middle-chapter scenario less The Empire Strikes Back than Attack of the Clones. It does provide a few high-tech flourishes. The trio of new screenwriters -- first-timer Brian Duffield action specialist Mark Bomback (Live Free or Die Hard Unstoppable) and designated Ron Howard scripture Akiva Goldsman (A Beautiful Mind Cinderella Man The Da Vinci Code) -- has junked reams of plot from Roths second novel and added a magic box a gift from the elders that will suss out the one true Divergent and I dont know either save or ruin the land. (Theres also a scene in which if I correctly read my Wikipedia synopsis of the book one of the major characters is given a different murderer.) Strapped into a Clockwork Orange apparatus with some Christian Grey leather Tris endures a bunch of simulations that vault her across the Chicago skyline and into netherspace. These are moderately cool but they simply underline the paucity of nuance and suspense in the people parts of the movie. Winslet and Watts though never more gorgeous or glowering mostly just strike attitudes as if referencing Madonnas old ""Vogue"" video. The younger actors have even less luck. James who made for a solid stolid prince consort in the first film turns whiny here. The only connection with more sizzle than fizzle is the enmity between Tris and Jeanines henchman and all-time rotter Eric (Jai Courtney). During the ample downtime watching Insurgent you can amuse yourself by gleefully imagining dreadful ways to kill off Eric. In the middling Divergent or the water-treading Insurgent through the series thickets and longueurs the one shining constant has been Woodley the 23-year-old graduate from indie fare (The Spectacular Now White Bird in a Blizzard The Fault in Our Stars) to franchise savior. Without a touch of movie glamour she wowed critics and forged identities with her young fans through her quiet intensity. I confess Ive been guilty of committing such rhapsodies writing of Woodley as Hazel in The Fault in Our Stars that she has the gift of acting internally she makes you watch her watch something lets you read the mind of her character like a good book. Often photographed in dermatological closeup Woodleys face is its own engrossing movie -- an autumnal symphony of darker and lighter browns. She makes Hazel the ideal narrator and receptive audience to Augustus agreeable showmanship. But Schwentke seems to think that the way to bring epic heft to this 3-D franchise is to wallpaper the whole movie with intimate images of his young star. Over and over her visage fills the giant IMAX screen like a sign painters view of a Hollywood Boulevard billboard during a two-hour traffic jam. One face even Woodleys can endure only so much rapt attention. So for the last two chapters in the series everyone is hereby ordered to step back a few paces. In the Allegiant movies Woodley has to be ready for her medium shot. Read next Shailene Woodley Calls Edward Snowden a Hero Listen to the most important stories of the day.

Photo Andrew Cooper MOVIE REVIEW Insurgent Running time 119 minutes. Rated PG-13 (absurdly sanitized violence). You know youre in for a long haul when Kate Winslets clipboard-wielding Jeanine leader of the Erudite faction comes off less like a Hillary Clinton than a weary Applebees supervisor at the end of a 14-hour shift in this plodding sequel to ""Divergent."" With the notable exception of the gifted Shailene Woodley -- who continues to give this increasingly pointless knockoff of the ""Hunger Games franchise better than it deserves as its cut-rate Katniss -- practically everyone youre watching seems to be wishing they were somewhere else. So you might want to take the hint. ""Insurgent"" descends into a valley of ennui not generally reached until the penultimate film of a young-adult-novel series where the studio is milking the final book for box-office hauls by splitting it into two films (as Summit will for ""Allegiant"" the final chapter of Veronica Roths ""Divergent"" trilogy in 2016 and 2017). Kate Winslet as Jeanine in ""Insurgent.""Photo Andrew Cooper Possibly for budgetary reasons ""Insurgent"" seems only mildly interested in the civil war that Woodleys Tris is trying to launch in a post-apocalyptic Chicago which for some reason is still surrounded by a giant electric fence separating it from what may be left of humanity. While Tris and her hunky pal Four (Theo James with whom she has zero chemistry) are trying to line up allies Jeanine has been given a plot (not in Roths book) involving a five-sided box she is convinced (how?) contains 200-year-old message from ""the founders"" she believes (why?) will enable her to become capo di tutti capi of the five families er factions. But Jeanine needs a special Divergent (an outcast with the attributes of all five factions) to open the box and you really have to wonder why it takes someone as bright as Jeanine forever to figure out that only Tris has the moxie to survive the five virtual-reality simulations needed to accomplish this task (which may put some viewers to sleep). When this occurs in what feels like the films fourth hour it provides an excuse to bring back Tris mom (Ashley Judd) who perished saving Tris the last time around. Tris who still feels guilty about this gets to return the favor -- at least in the simulation -- by trying to rescue Mom from a burning building thats flying through the air. Naomi Watts as Evelyn.Photo Andrew Cooper Theres a surfeit of mother figures in ""Insurgent"" which is much longer on heart-to-heart talks than action compared to its (slightly) superior predecessor which was directed by Neil Burger instead of the more prosaic Robert Schwentke. Besides the tantrum-throwing Jeanine Naomi Watts makes her first appearance as Jeanines old rival and Fours long-presumed-dead mother Evelyn. ""Do you do want to tuck him in or shall I? she hisses at Tris referring to the petulant son who wants nothing to do with her but is at least theoretically doing the nasty with Tris. I had to take off my 3-D glasses to make out the face of Octavia Spencer picking up a paycheck as a schoolmarmish Amity leader who reluctantly provides sanctuary to Tris and Four. The film is very dimly lit (the better to disguise the less-than-great effects) and the further light loss in 3-D tends to swallow up its African-American characters including a returning Zoe Kravitz in a blink-and-youll-miss-her role. Another new character (played by Daniel Dae Kim as a sort of extended ""Star Trek"" audition) is a Candor leader who conducts a game-show-like interrogation of our heroine and hero while theyre under the influence of truth serum. He and the audience repeatedly chant ""Thank you for your Candor which is funny. At least the first time. Theres sarcasm aplenty from Miles Teller as the weaselly Peter who gets a pistol pointed at his temples roughly once every 10 minutes. Judging by the expression on the ""Whiplash"" stars face he seems to be thinking ""Please pull the trigger and get me out of two more of these."" ""Insurgent"" finally reaches a mind-bogglingly ridiculous climax. ""I know this doesnt make any sense"" says Tris. ""But you have to trust me."" Dont.

Highly contagious and serious it is my duty to alert you about this affliction. Its called Young Adult Dystopian Fatigue Syndrome. PHOTOS Shailenes red carpet style You or someone you love may have already been afflicted with YADFS. A few symptoms an emotional detachment to watching humorless teens shooting each other with guns while the heroes somehow manage to dodge every bullet; boredom and weariness as the characters form armies and plot rebellions against the heartless enemy; and frustration with the ambiguous cliffhanger -- though anyone who read the popular best seller source material already knows the end game. I was immune after two Hunger Games films The Maze Runner The Giver and Divergent. I believe I contacted YADFS after The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 1 in November. But it didnt turn into a stage-five problem until I restlessly sat through the Divergent sequel Insurgent. While neither a disastrous nor an astounding effort this film stands out because it doesnt stand out at all. Its merely Frankenstein-ed from its elders. Oh no hold on I feel a familiar plot summary coming on . . . Theo James Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley in Insurgent Andrew Cooper PHOTOS Celebs and their stunt doubles Were still in a futuristic Chicago society where people are divided into five factions based on skill and aptitude. (Abnegation = selfless; Erudite = intelligent; Candor = honest; Dauntless = brave; Amity = peaceful). Tris (Shailene Woodley) is a unique ""divergent"" who does not conform into any category -- and therefore extremely dangerous. At the end of Divergent she and her sexy boyfriend/mentor Four (Theo James) along with her brother (Ansel Elgort) and semi-ally Peter (Miles Teller) are on the lam from sinister ambitious Erudite leader Jeanine (Kate Winslet). The sequel picks up three days later with the crew hiding out in the Amity faction. The harmony doesnt last long Jeanine is out to get Tris and she has summoned up her own personal brute squad -- former members of Dauntless -- to search and destroy. But then Jeanine puts a bounty on her Seems the special Tris is the only person capable of opening up a magical box that may or may not help Erudites rule the world and get rid of the Divergents once and for all. That said if Jeanine is so uniformly feared and the other factions want to help Tris amp; Co. doesnt that make everyone divergent in some way? (No wonder the audience chuckled after Tris tells Four ""I know this doesnt make any sense"") PHOTOS Movies that make male stars cry Trainloads of action abound (literally) but its essentially generic combat. Punch point shoot kill get out of the way in the nick of time depending on your billing in the closing credits. Still like Divergent the film shows off some truly nifty special effects when it delves into Tris subconscious. Deep into the narrative she must decipher whether her visions of her loved are legit or just faux ""SIMs"" planted by Jeanine. Its a breathtaking 3-D-enhanced virtual world. PHOTOS Best and worst movie remakes Ansel Elgort in Insurgent Andrew Cooper Woodley excels in these sequences as well. The former TV dramedy star was palpably uncomfortable in the no-BS heroine role in the first go-round. Here shes a true muscular sneering force. (Maybe its the short hair? That old ponytail screamed ""poor girls Katniss.""). Its mystifying that Woodley flails when she attempts to drum up tears revealing her deepest darkest secrets to the Candor tribe. Its shockingly unconvincing. And this same actress after all turned in her most moving work in last years Kleenex-fest The Fault in Our Stars. All that screen time with her Stars soul mate Elgort only serve as a wistful reminder of Woodleys more-impressive film resume. For that matter so do her scenes with The Spectacular Now love Teller. Now that was daring original filmmaking. But then (arms stretched. . . .yawn. . . . .) So far there is no cure for YADFS. In fact two more Divergent films are in the pipeline through 2017. Lets just hope the health of these installments -- and its counterparts -- shows marked improvement. Because ultimately no matter how rough these people have it in the future were the ones who really suffer.

Neither actually - ""Insurgent"" is part of the young-adult dystopian series about teenagers divided into factions - but I wouldnt be surprised if were all a little confused by now. I mean how many hells can one future hold? A lot apparently. The whole glum genre has made millions and that in itself is a little dispiriting; unlike the old-time sci-fi of Asimov Silverberg and Clarke which were rich with possibility these new tales all forecast a bleak future ruined by adults. The ""Divergent"" series though is at least better written than ""The Hunger Games"" books and the movies are a bit more complex; they do without the over-the-top satirical figures and feature an even more flawed and reluctant heroine. Shes Tris and shes played by Shailene Woodley. In the first film we found out she was a ""divergent"" - someone whose complex personality kept her from being slotted into one of societys ready-made castes (""Dauntless"" for example is for soldiers and police; ""Candor"" for lawgivers). That made her dangerous for some reason and the target of the lands ruler Jeanine. By now Tris is on the run along with her boyfriend Four and a definitely not to be trusted ex-Dauntless cadet Peter. And Jeanine wants her back - even if she has to kill everyone else to do it. Woodley gives Tris her all which is considerable - as an actress her emotions are always vibrating just below the surface like a plucked guitar string - while Kate Winslet tamps down all of her own very emotional openness to play the ice-queen Jeanine. As for the supporting male characters (because this is very much a female-centric saga and one happily free of any Which Boy Should I Choose soap opera) Cape Mays Miles Teller gets all the snarky lines as Peter while Theo James dutifully does his hunky boyfriend duties as Four. Director Robert Schwentke meanwhile makes good use of 3D particularly in the specially engineered lucid dreams - called ""sims"" - in which Tris has to pass certain tests as she jumps in and out of floating buildings or confronts her most hated enemy. Yet the sims dont provide much suspense -- both we and Tris know theyre fake -- and the plot is problematic. Even if you saw the first installment it takes a while to pick up the threads again particularly as to what this crunchy-granola Amity commune is or why mere ""divergence"" alone poses such an existential threat. And although the novels necessarily been condensed some important things seem to have been lost; threats appear and disappear arbitrarily and while the ending is meant to build up anticipation for the inevitable parts three and four it plays as mostly resolved; you dont walk out of the theater thinking I cant wait til the next one. But of course there will be a next one. And when this YA series ends another. Because as long as writers keep making millions by scaring teens with stories of mean adults and nasty technology there will be producers making even more millions by using smart adults and new technology to turn them into movies. Ratings note The film contains violence and sexuality. Insurgent (PG-13) Summit/Lionsgate (119 min.) Directed by Robert Schwentke. With Shailene Woodley Theo James Miles Teller Kate Winslet.

"Review Insurgent finds its footing - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Insurgent finds its footingBy Randy MyersSan Jose Mercury News CorrespondentPosted 03/18/2015 120000 AM PDTUpdated 03/18/2015 044148 PM PDT Talk about bad timing.When the first film in ""The Divergent Series"" hit theaters in 2014 critics and even some audiences were growing tired of young adult dystopian novel adaptations that feature feisty female protagonists. But now the YA-based film deluge has receded a bit and that might be part of why ""Insurgent"" the second outing in the series based on Veronica Roths best-selling trilogy seems better than its predecessor.Even though whiffs of ""The Hunger Games"" linger with ""Insurgent"" the series -- starring Shailene Woodley -- is coming into its own. A slimmed-down running time and a dynamo cast made up of todays brightest young actors paired up with accomplished adult actresses enrich the franchise. The head-tripping visuals help too reminding us of the world-building construction and deconstruction Christopher Nolans exceptional ""Inception"" dreamed up.Does that mean director Robert Schwentke and screenwriters Brian Duffield Akiva Goldsman and Mark Bomback borrow cups of inspiration from other sources? Of course they do as do many in the genre.But when you have Woodley flying the plane and Theo James as her unbelievably handsome yet conflicted wingman Four who cares? OK dystopian fatigue sets in every now and then but this is a worthwhile confident entry in the YA genre. That said be forewarned Should you wander into ""Insurgent"" having not seen the first film or read the books good luck Youll be completely lost.Advertisement ""Insurgent"" picks up right after 2014s ""Divergent"" with Tris (Woodley) on the lam and plagued by nightmares after the death of her parents and her friend. Tris is a thorn in the side of the severe cunning and powerful Jeanine (Kate Winslet at her chilly best) who took it on the chin at the end of the first film.Played appealingly and believably by Woodley Tris wont be hemmed in by a society that demands each teenager get plunked into a particular group after a series of tests. The future Roth has created is cruel bleak and finds order is best maintained in a walled-in Chicago by lumping people into five distinct groups. Abnegation embraces altruism Amity is made up of what resembles peace-loving hippies Candor speaks honestly Dauntless takes pride in being athletic and tough and Erudite is made up of intellectuals.In the first film Tris landed in Dauntless but soon reveals she is Divergent -- someone who has all traits and is thus seen as dangerous. She ends up hanging out with the Factionless those who like her have no official place in society and are shunned. (L-R) Shailene Woodley as Tris Theo James as Four and Ansel Ford as Caleb in The Divergent Series Insurgent. (Andrew Cooper/Lionsgate) Thats a lot of back story to wade through and at times the expository world-building weighs heavy here too. But in ""Insurgent"" twists and developments bulk up the story and help further define the characters.Tris and Four along with Tris Erudite-labeled brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) and the cagey Peter (Miles Teller) are hiding out in a meadow in a communelike setting with the Amity group. The gracious leader here is Johanna played by Academy Award-winning actress Octavia Spencer who is wasted here. I imagine her role was bigger in the book.Cut to evil Jeanine who now has a magical box that when unlocked will reveal a powerful message. The problem is that it requires the skills of a Divergent to get to that message. Tris of course is the mighty one and soon Jeanine wants to get her polished nails into her. Tris and Four dodge muscular bad guys and wind up hanging with the Factionless where they meet Evelyn (Naomi Watts) a revolutionary. The exchanges between Theo and Evelyn are well done and give both actors a chance to shine. In fact all the actors are top-notch and at least two have worked closely with Woodley before. Elgort who was Woodleys romantic co-star in the lovely ""The Fault in Our Stars"" handles one of the toughest roles well. Teller who co-starred with her in the indie gem ""The Spectacular Now"" is perfectly cast as the shady Peter. The production values are high with surreal visual effects that serve to enhance the story. The 3-D though is unnecessary so save your money.All these positive factors point to a promising future for this familiar but slightly different series. But the studios decision to divide the final book into two films is risky. Just ask Katniss who after two terrific films went way off target with the last years talk-heavy ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 1."" insurgent    Rating PG-13 (intense violence and action throughout some sensuality thematic elements and brief language)Cast Shailene Woodley Theo James Kate Winslet Octavia Spencer Naomi Watts Miles Teller Ansel Elgort Director Robert Schwentke Running time 1 hour 58 minutes Print Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Curb Your Enthusiasm The long wait for new episodes is almost overGame of Thrones Season 8 definitely the lastReview Holocaust haunts family in The Gathering Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

(Andrew cooper) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Tuesday March 17 2015 324 PM Title ""The Divergent Series Insurgent"" Film Info A girl fights in a sci-fi future. Director Robert Schwentke (158). PG-13 Violence sexuality. Area theaters; 3-D Imax where available. ""Insurgent"" is a starving persons ""Hunger Games."" It may fill up the multiplex moments when Katniss is between bouts but this absurd action-drama saga is below even its anemic debut last years hit ""Divergent."" Along with a catch-as-catch-can dystopian mythology -- courtesy of Veronica Roths YA novels -- ""Insurgent"" has a glib way with violence and retribution something the ""Hunger Games"" films with their stronger metaphor avoid. Yes its crucial for girls to have superheroines to look up to but this stuff gets nasty. Over 200 years in the future Chicago is split into ""factions"" with various personality types having a zone. Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley) and her boyfriend Four (Theo James) -- both ""Divergent"" -- are out to take down Jeanine (Kate Winslet) the bitchy overlord of their gated-in world. How bitchy? Jeanine zombified the ""Dauntless"" faction so the smarty ""Erudites"" could rule all. Now she wants to wipe out Divergents. Sounds great right? Unfortunately director Robert Schwentkes big set piece is a silly-looking talent-extraction device that sticks cords into Tris inducing ""simulation scenarios."" In fact every scene is entwined in clunkiness. Theo James and Shailene Woodley get a closeup in ""The Divergent Series Insurgent."" Woodley great in ""The Spectacular Now"" and ""The Fault in Our Stars"" is a humdrum action star. Her amiable yet laid-back style turns the films key moments from do-or-die into OK-whatever. James with a giant tattoo on his back that gets its own closeup in a sex scene too intimate for young fans is all snarls. Too bad Roths story gives him the heavy lifting. Miles Teller at least provides fun as this movies version of ""Star Wars "" Lando Calrissian charming even when hes conniving. Naomi Watts is mysterious as the leader of ""factionless"" fighters perhaps because she looks like 1980s-era Stevie Nicks. As for Winslet shes efficient but hasnt much to do. Hollywoods female roles were once reduced to merely ""ingenue girlfriend wife then mother."" Now thanks to Winslet Meryl Streep (""The Giver"") Julianne Moore (""Hunger Games"") and Jodie Foster (""Elysium"") theres one more ""sci-fi villainess."" Thats no great improvement. And ""Insurgent"" is just a cinematic irritant.

As butt-kicking Tris the The Fault in Our Stars actress is the best thing about this second film of Veronica Roths monster-selling YA novels (basically The Hunger Games with tattoos). After the lifeless first film Insurgent finds a pulse but its far-fetched post-apocalyptic world still feels invented solely to make room for a copy-Katniss lethally-tough heroine. She is Tris a rare Divergent in a future world in which people are divided neatly into factions according to personality Abnegation (selfless) Amity (peaceful) Candor (honest) Dauntless (brave) and Erudite (intelligent). Insurgent kicks off where the first film left off. Which means we get to see more of Kate Winslet as ice-cold Jeanine the leader of Erudite who is pinning on Tris and Dauntless the attack she masterminded last time around. Enter Naomi Watts as Jeanines nemesis a Faction-less rebel whose black eyeliner tells us she spells trouble. The plot makes zero sense and Woodleys on-screen chemistry with scowling hunk Four (Theo James) is non-existent. Terrible things happen but betrayals and twists pass without emotional impact. Still with muscles rippling down her back and terror and heartbreak passing over her face Tris is a character you cant take your eyes off. No film with Shailene Woodley can be that bland.

Fairy Tales Invade Theaters Hollywoods New Superheroes? Snazzy effects and slumming Oscar-winners aside not much makes this film stand out from its many competitors So I saw the new Shailene Woodley movie the one with Miles Teller. No thats ""The Spectacular Now."" This one has Ansel Elgort. Uh no youre thinking of ""The Fault in Our Stars."" This is the one based on the popular YA novels about the special girl who fights back against a totalitarian government. Not ""The Hunger Games"" no; this is the one where everyones in a walled city. Yeah no that would be ""The Maze Runner."" See Video Insurgent Final Trailer Dark Times Call for Extreme Measures (Video) Im talking about the movie where a slumming Academy Award winner plays the evil ruler like shes a cross between Hillary Clinton and Frau Blucher from ""Young Frankenstein."" I see where youre confused; that would be Meryl Streep in ""The Giver."" This is actually the movie where mankinds hope for the future is hiding out in caves. Seriously? ""The Host""? You saw that one? I just checked This movie is called ""Insurgent."" No ""Insurgent."" Its the sequel to ""Divergent."" Its the one where -- look never mind. So yes take everything annoying about a cobbled-together overly familiar YA adaptation add the built-in wheel-spinning of a sequel and youve got ""Insurgent"" a film that works best when it places its heroine inside virtual-reality situations -- at least then it has an excuse for eschewing logic and context. Also Read Insurgent Fans Can Join Miles Teller Kate Winslet in New Virtual Reality Experience In this future-dystopian world where a micro-society has been divided into factions Tris (Woodley) is a ""divergent"" someone whose innate abilities place her into more than one of those categories. Following the massacre of her parents and the other members of the altruistic Abnegation faction Tris -- along with boyfriend Four (Theo James) and the not-entirely-trustworthy Peter (Teller) -- are hiding out with the gentle souls of Amity. Their own faction the security-minded Dauntless has become the muscle for the brainiacs of Erudite and the trio must plot their next move with the help of Tris brother Caleb (Elgort) whos an Erudite himself. The wickedly ambitious Jeanine (Kate Winslet) wants to destroy Tris until its revealed that the young divergent is the only person around (theres that YA ""special snowflake"" trope rearing its perfect little head again) who can open a magical doohickey with a message from their societys founders one that Jeanine is convinced will bolster her campaign of wiping out all the divergents. Tris meanwhile is beating herself up for failing to save her parents in the previous movie as well as for having killed other members of Dauntless who were under Winslets mental control. Also Read Divergent Trilogy Closer Allegiant Drafts Maze Runner Writer Noah Oppenheim Woodley has proven herself to be a capable performer but ""Insurgent"" features the first instances of bad acting Ive seen her give in a film notably a scene in which Jack (Daniel Dae Kim) of the lawyerly Candor faction shoots her up with truth serum that would appear to be Ham Juice given the amount of crying and grimacing and overplaying that director Robert Schwentke (""R.I.P.D."") allows Woodley to perpetrate. ""Insurgent"" perks up a bit when seasoned vets like Winslet or Octavia Spencer (as the leader of Amity) or Naomi Watts (playing a revolutionary who has history with Four) pop up for a scene or two but for the most part this all plays out like yet another movie about pretty young people in futuristic sportswear punching or shooting each other. Where the film works best are in those moments where it frees itself from the bonds of its own world which it explains both too much and not enough and enters intentionally artificial simulations in which Tris must attempt to unlock the box by showing that she has all the best qualities of all five factions. ""Insurgent"" becomes pure eye candy at this point yes but its the only satisfying morsel this movie can serve.

TWITTER Shailene Woodley kicks butt and gets angsty in the sequel to Divergent. After a shaky opening The Divergent Series as the movie franchise based on Veronica Roths YA novel trilogy is now officially called offers a more cohesive and involving second installment with Insurgent. In part the improvement is a function of storytelling logistics Having defined the rules of its dystopian future world in last years Divergent the saga is considerably less encumbered by exposition and setup. Shailene Woodleys Tris Prior the reluctant chosen one at the center of the postapocalyptic thriller is on the run and theres narrative momentum in pure kinetics. Theres a new director at the helm too -- Robert Schwentke who brings a flair for taut and flavorful action (as demonstrated in Flightplan and RED if not R.I.P.D.). Theres no question that the feature is a leaner meaner affair than its predecessor. Thats not enough though to counterbalance the often oppressive self-seriousness (though Miles Teller gives it a welcome shot) or to plaster over the holes in the premise. Whatever its narrative deficiencies the movie opening in a variety of 2D and 3D formats precisely a year after Divergent is sure to repeat the box-office triumph of the first chapter as eager fans dig in. Read more  Lionsgate Samsung turn Divergent Sequel Insurgent into Virtual Reality Even with breathless chases strong design components and dazzling effects the storys organizing principle -- the faction system that divides society into five groups based on personality -- grows less compelling as Insurgent proceeds. The MacGuffin that spurs the action a mystery box that only Tris can unlock containing a message about said system is a handsome objet dart with blinking blue lights its big reveal dutifully setting up the next sequel while casting the storys defining metaphor in doubt. (Following YA franchise convention Summit plans a two-film adaptation of the final book Allegiant.) Beginning with a bracing race through woods the movie picks up where Divergent left off in the aftermath of a war against Abnegation the selfless faction in which Tris grew up. Targeted for her gifts as a category-defying Divergent by villainous Erudite leader Jeanine (Kate Winslet) Tris is a fugitive on the run with her boyfriend Four (Theo James) a fellow Divergent; her seemingly timid brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort); and frenemy Peter. The latter characters Machiavellian maneuvers enliven the story with something close to intrigue; playing him with a wiseass swagger Teller injects the glum doings with jolts of sarcastic energy. During a brief sanctuary at the Amity compound a sylvan commune of feel-gooders headed by the Earth-motherly Johanna (Octavia Spencer) Tris has time to take scissors to her hair for a symbolic -- and expertly stylish -- makeover before she and Four are on the lam again. The city around them Chicago is in ruins and when Tris isnt hopping trains outrunning armored tanks or going mano a mano with would-be captors shes something of a wreck herself. Having lost her parents (Ashley Judd Tony Goldwyn) in the war shes wracked by grief guilt and nightmares and feels unworthy of her role as the potential destroyer of Jeanine and liberator of an enslaved society. Her tearful hesitation grows tiring. Like Divergent director Neil Burger Schwentke somewhat understandably has a weakness for closeups of Woodley (those eyes those lashes) but a distracting preponderance of tight shots of Tris welling up as she mulls her fate does nothing to heighten the emotional impact of her situation. Even so Woodley is convincingly vulnerable and tough and James makes Fours stoic strength persuasive. The rest of the performers bring as much dimension as they can to single-note characters among them Naomi Watts as Fours estranged mother (an earthy brunette in contrast to Winslets frosty blonde). In the imaginatively reconfigured warehouse complex of the dispossessed Factionless Four confronts her along with his long-stewing abandonment issues while she presses for an alliance that would kickstart a revolution. Read more  Insurgent Director Robert Schwentke to Return for Allegiant Part 1 Streamlining Roths 500-plus-page book three credited screenwriters -- Brian Duffield Akiva Goldsman and Mark Bomback -- have reduced the number of characters and incidents while crafting dialogue that tends toward the thuddingly obvious. There are also tone-deaf moments like the use of the already somewhat dated word ""mankind"" in voiceover narration particularly jarring in a femme-centric story set in the future. Tris coming-of-age crisis finds very literal expression when in one of the drug-induced simulations that Jeanine subjects her to shes forced to go mano a mano with herself and in the process turns intended torture into a lesson in self-forgiveness. However heavy-handed that sequence its in the simulation episodes that Schwentke and cinematographer Florian Ballhaus whose work is supple throughout pull out the VFX big guns creating extraordinary hallucinatory visuals that range from abstract imagery to the suspenseful journey of a burning house floating above an imploding city. In these scenes the otherwise pointless 3D lends a subtle depth. Except for brief location work in the Windy City the production was filmed in Atlanta with Alec Hammonds rich production design bringing the various factions to vivid life from the rubble of Abnegation to the gleaming high-rise HQ of Candor whose leader (Daniel Dae Kim) conducts a trial by truth serum that shakes Tris to the core. Louise Mingenbachs faction-apt costumes never call attention to themselves. The operatically pulsing score by Joseph Trapanese likewise is a fine fit.

From the beginning women have been the heroes villains role models and leaders in Veronica Roths ""Divergent"" series so it should come as no surprise that its year-later sequel ""Insurgent"" advances the paradigm adding a formidable new character in Naomi Watts Evelyn -- albeit one with not much to do until the next installment. Just as the exposition-heavy ""Divergent"" promised big things to come director Robert Schwentkes like-minded follow-up remains squarely forward-focused but lacks the moment-to-moment thrill of puzzling out versatile protagonist Tris Priors place in a society designed to categorize its citizens into one of five rigidly defined factions. Here Tris knows her role and instead spends most of the movie coming to terms with the casualties already on her conscience making this entire deja vu episode feel like a hurdle the franchise must clear before moving on to its two-part finale. Though marketed as a kid sister to ""The Hunger Games"" franchise right down to its optimistic four-film release strategy (which suddenly feels a bit riskier after the slight dip ""Mockingjay"" experienced at the B.O.) Summits ""Divergent"" series boasts a significantly different narrative arc from that of Suzanne Collins girl-power trilogy. Rather than building up to a massive insurrection Roth compresses the overthrow of her dystopian police state -- what remains of Chicago now encircled by a high-powered electric fence -- into book two while laying the groundwork for a whole new set of secrets and surprises to follow. At this point the series big mystery seems to be just how divergent the next two pics will be from Roths vision especially considering a certain permeability in the way ""Insurgent"" redefines the protective barrier surrounding the city. Tris (the wonderfully relatable Shailene Woodley) and her b.f./bodyguard Four (Theo James whos more man than the ""Twilight"" and ""Hunger Games"" hunks combined) appeared to be riding a train directly toward that wall as the credits rolled on ""Divergent"" and yet the sequel takes place entirely within its confines ending with a revelation that could allow the forthcoming ""Allegiant"" movies to go in an entirely unexpected direction if the producers were so inclined. Meanwhile true to its source ""Insurgent"" opens in Amity where the peace-and-love faction is sheltering those on the run from the power-hungry Jeanine (Kate Winslet) whose intelligent Erudite class has ousted the selfless members of Abnegation and seized control of the city mobilizing the brave Dauntless faction as her private police force. Ostensibly the most cunning human being alive Jeanine makes several grave miscalculations in her plans for how to control the perceived threat -- starting with her faulty assumption that Divergent citizens (those like Tris who dont fit into any one group) necessarily represent a threat in the first place. More foolish still is her conviction that a locked box hidden by Tris now-deceased mom (Ashley Judd resurfacing in dreams and flashbacks) contains a message from the citys founders that will somehow justify Jeanines ruthless dictatorial control. The box which was invented by the screenwriters to provide a handful of cinematic sequences for the movie can only be opened by a Divergent strong enough to pass five ""sims"" -- tests calibrated to the skills of each faction. Packed into the films last half-hour these setpieces represent ""Insurgents"" best effort at re-creating the surreal excitement of the first movie allowing Tris to perform such superhuman feats as chasing a burning building across the sky and crashing through a bulletproof control-booth window. But that misses the point since it wasnt merely the visual effects that made ""Divergent"" exciting but the vicarious way director Neil Burger and his screenwriters (all of whom have been replaced for the sequel) invited audiences to discover the rules of this unfamiliar sci-fi world alongside their lead character. To an extent that earlier film was as much like ""The Matrix"" as it was ""The Hunger Games"" teasing the imagination with virtual-reality training environments nested dream-within-dream illusions and talents that defy physical constraints. But instead of pushing deeper down the rabbit hole as the Wachowskis did with their sequels ""Insurgent"" actually backtracks and opts to build out the ""real world"" in which it takes place. Instead of adding layers to the ensemble (such young talents as Miles Teller Ansel Elgort Jai Courtney and Zoe Kravitz are all but wasted providing one-dimensional opposition) this strategy offers a chance for Schwentkes below-the-line crew to excel as they seamlessly expand upon what Burger and his team established. Whereas ""Divergent"" split its time between Abnegation and Dauntless the new film attempts to give equal time to the other classes including the aforementioned Amity (which looks like a hippie farming cult overseen by Octavia Spencer) honesty-loving Candor (whose chief justice played by Daniel Dae Kim subjects Tris and Four to a trial by truth serum) and those who simply dont fit in -- the factionless overseen by Watts duplicitous queen Evelyn. Dangerous and feral the factionless pose a far greater threat to Jeanines regime than the Divergents do as the ruthless despot will realize too late. Although her villain has genocidal intentions Roth demonstrates a far different attitude toward violence than Collins did in ""The Hunger Games"" which encouraged a certain bloodlust with its ""Battle Royale""-style premise. By contrast Roths characters must deal primarily with the emotional consequences of their actions Tris is haunted by the three deaths she carries on her conscience and somewhere along the way one of the films three writers (Brian Duffield Akiva Goldsman and Mark Bomback) came up with a rather poignant scene in which she finally manages to forgive herself. While it doesnt necessarily excuse gun battles so brutal you cant always keep up with the body count this attitude lends a certain sense of responsibility to the action which still feels clumsier than a franchise of this caliber deserves. On multiple occasions Tris opts to spare her adversaries outright suggesting that perhaps she truly does represent a more evolved form of the violent humans from whom she descends. And then theres the matter of how the film handles a major characters ""death"" -- one of those possum feints that fools no one in the audience but somehow dupes the films smartest character. Suffice to say theres nothing Erudite in the way that whole situation plays out. Considering that ""Insurgent"" is meant to represent the series great civil war it all comes across feeling like a tempest in a teapot a glorified rehash of what came before garnished with the promise of what lies in store. Evelyn has been introduced but barely used; Tris got to confront her guilt while redemonstrating her Divergent skills; and the central couple has inched just a little bit closer to crossing that mysterious wall. Perhaps instead of splitting the third book into two movies they should have considered combining the first two into one.

Reply shan says March 18 2015 at 1228 pm Why did you trash The Hunger Games so much? Reply Clydes Stuff (clydesMP) says March 13 2015 at 211 am Honestly if most viewers knew how this series was going to end theyd be as ticked off as at least half probably more of those who invested in the books and absolutely hated Allegiant. I would love to know how much of the audience read the book and how many havent. I can only tell you that if my girlfriend knew where this was going she wouldnt invest another minute. Try googling Allegiant backlash or muddling through the Amazon Reviews. Talk about backlash. It would seem the only ones who really like the idea are the actors and crew making these movies. So Im left scratching my head as to why they thought it was a good idea to split that travesty known as Allegiant into two parts. It was the worst received worst reviews of the series. Well see what happens. Reply Adam says March 12 2015 at 425 am Meh the movie is still going to make a ton of money at the box office irrespective of any reviews. Reply Lex says March 12 2015 at 1254 pm I dont think it will make a lot of money considering the first one didnt. This could be another example of a franchise ending before it is starting like The Percy Jackson series. Reply Judy says March 12 2015 at 948 am True. This franchise has a large and fervent enough fanbase where the business is almost review-proof. At most negative reviews would affect just the portion of the general audience who didnt necessarily like the first movie all that much and might not bother to check out the second if they hear its not any better. Reply irwinator1992 says March 12 2015 at 347 am I guess all the potential the first Divergent had just flew out the window. I was in the minority that liked the first film. Veronica Roth needs to take lessons from the likes of Christopher amp; Jonathan Nolan on how to write a good story and Zack Snyder on how to make good action. Reply IT 2 IT says March 12 2015 at 219 am They say people DONT read much anymore. It shows. . . . Reply Clydes Stuff (clydesMP) says March 12 2015 at 118 am This is nonsense ""which suddenly feels a bit riskier after the slight dip ""Mockingjay"" experienced at the B.O."" Slight dip? It was the second highest grossing film from 2014 (and not by much) and yet you guys keep trying to push the narrative that it was a failure. Ridiculous. There may be problems ahead but it has nothing to do with The Hunger Games. Really get over it. You couldnt bring The Hunger Game Series down so just give up. Reply Judy says March 12 2015 at 944 am Mockingjay had a 20% drop from Catching Fire which sounds like a lot in general terms but in the context of how much money those movies bring in that 20% decline really doesnt mean anything. Oh boo hoo it only made 120 million opening weekend when it used to open to 150M Yeah. They can afford to drop that much. The Divergent movies not so much. Thats the articles point. These movies dont bring in the kind of money where they can have a 20 25% decline in the later installments and it likely will simply because that seems to be the pattern with these kinds of movies - even a powerhouse like Hunger Games. And that would be problematic in this case because their ROI cant really support that. You dont spend over 100M (Im only guessing that Insurgent cost more than Divergent as will Allegiant) on a movie to have it open at 30-something million. Reply Cris says March 12 2015 at 1042 am exactly. and Mockingjay was also only released in 2D and it still managed to be the highest grossing film in 2014 (yeah yeah American Sniper technically but only by a hair) . Insurgent might get a bump from its 3d and imax tickets but its still currently tracking to make the same as it did in its opening weekend for Divergent and usually these projections are ballooned. divergent was projected to make 80m same time last year but only managed a mid-50s intake. Plus March/April is more competitive this year than it was last year. NotTris says March 11 2015 at 924 pm this review is confusing to follow on what the movie is really about so i guess thats a reflection of the quality of this film. Definitely not Catching Fire. Reply Non-Divergent says March 16 2015 at 653 pm I found it confusing too then read the premise on another site amp; fully understood it. I think it may be this reviewer who is struggling to paraphrase the plot. Reply Hannah says March 11 2015 at 523 pm Unless its different in the Insurgent film which is unlikely seeing as it was said in the Divergent film the Amity fields and compound are located outside of the fence (not wall) and that was where they were heading on the train at the end of the first film. Reply Judy says March 12 2015 at 945 am Which never made any sense to me. If people arent supposed to leave why is the one group located outside? Poorly thought out worldbuilding. Reply MN says March 11 2015 at 521 pm Drag this low-rent franchise Reply equipmentguy says March 11 2015 at 509 pm Wow. This movie sounds like too much work Give me LOTR movies any day. Reply Ken says March 11 2015 at 807 pm Totally agree with ya. Whew Reply See All 18 Comments More Film News from Variety The Power of Content Divorce Marks Sarah Jessica Parkers Return To HBO But...
