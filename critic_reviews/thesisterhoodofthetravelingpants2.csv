By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor August 9 2008 Save for later Saved I forget which stand-up comic once said that he would never see a movie that had ""traveling pants"" in the title. Whoever it was I feel his pain. Having recently sat through ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2"" I am here to say that it doesnt measure up to ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants."" Which is sort of like saying ""Rocky V"" wasnt as good as ""Rocky IV."" Sort of.Based as was the first film on the ""Sisterhood"" novels of Ann Brashares - no I have not read them - ""Pants 2"" boasts the same sporty cast from three years ago. Its nice to see that sisterhood works in real life too - no contract hold-outs. Maybe the specter of ""Sex and the City"" acted as a goad. Why should that movie be the only one to mine the chick-flick motherlode?In case youre not up on ""Pants"" lore heres a mini-tutorial. In the first film the four fast friends from childhood found a pair of dungarees that magically fit all of them despite their varying shapes and sizes and diets and binges. As a way of staying in touch the girls FedExed the pants back and forth. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? In ""Pants 2"" one of the girls discovers she may be pregnant - no alterations please - and the FedExing continues. All four have moved on Lena (Alexis Bledel) is attending the Rhode Island School of Design Bridget (Blake Lively) plays soccer at Brown; Tibby (Amber Tamblyn) is studying at the NYU film school where no doubt she is learning to make movies completely unlike ""Pants 2."" Carmen (America Ferrera) whose life journey is easily the most interesting among the quartet is toiling backstage at the Yale School of Drama. Instead of lugging costumes around shed rather be acting. But shes just so shy a liability in the performing profession. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 Carmen tries to engineer a summer reunion but Tibby is in Manhattan for summer school Bridget is on an archaeological dig in Turkey and Lena is enrolled in a life drawing class where she falls for the male model (Jesse Williams) while still in thrall to her Greek boyfriend Kostos (Michael Rady) (who has inopportunely gotten married without informing her).With her friends scattered - in more ways than one - Carmen accepts an invitation to a Vermont theater camp accompanied by a Yale classmate (Rachel Nichols) whose porcelain prettiness is a dead giveaway that she is not to be trusted. No sisterhood for her. No pants either. (Shes more of a skirts person).The only one of these criss-crossing plots with any compelling interest is Carmens. This is mainly because she ends up winning the part of Perdita in a production of ""The Winters Tale"" and so we occasionally get to hear Shakespeares dialogue which is a full stratosphere above the lines supplied by screenwriter Elizabeth Chandler. Also Ferrera is charming as always. She even makes a creditable Perdita.The only genuine moments of emotion come not from the lead actresses but from that great trouper Blythe Danner playing Bridgets estranged grandmother. Its only a cameo but in a few deft strokes she brings this embittered woman to life. I am always in awe of actors who give it their all even when the giving is not worth the all. I have long maintained that Danner is one of the three or four greatest actresses in America. If you dont feel comfortable seeing her in ""Pants 2"" I must remind you that her movie appearances alas are few. Support ""Pants 2."" Maybe theyll bring her back for ""Pants 3."" Grade C (Rated PG-13 for mature material and sensuality.)

(117 min.) Directed by Sanaa Hamri. With Alexis Bledel America Ferrera Blake Lively Amber Tamblyn. Opens today at theaters in New Jersey. TWO STARS Their friendships are fracturing their bonds growing ever more tenuous. The more they struggle with their lives the more they seem to battle alone. ""Maybe the pants"" muses America Ferrera ""had done all a pair of pants could do."" You think? The original ""Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" -- a series of books and a sweet 2005 film -- was an endearing fantasy about a magical pair of blue jeans that fit everybody -- and every body -- perfectly. As I mentioned it was a fantasy. What was real though was the emotional connection these girls shared too as this unlikely quartet -- WASP goddess and uncertain Latina reserved artist and brash bohemian -- went through life. And what was charming three years ago was seeing these young actresses on the brink of something. They all return in this film and their impact remains the same. Amber Tamblyn is still the best actress Alexis Bledel the most sincere Blake Lively the most magazine-cover-ready and Ferrera probably the luckiest. (Of course talent not being everything its Lively and Ferrera whove become the biggest stars.) All four slip back into their old characters even as they pursue a summer of new adventures. Ferrera takes a summer-stock job and Lively reconnects with an estranged relative. Tamblyn and Bledel have romances and learn something about disappointment and second chances. Yet its this series that seems to have used up our forgiveness. Maybe Ferreras right -- maybe the pants have done all a pair of pants can do. But in any case what had once seemed like a fresh alternative to the usual tween-girl movie has begun to fray. Its not that they havent tried to patch it up a bit. Director Sanaa Hamri previously helmed the interracial romance ""Something New"" and shes jazzed this up too with some quietly diverse dating. There are also a couple of classy guest stars including Shohreh Aghdashloo and Blythe Danner. Neither veteran sticks around very long though and too much of the film feels like ""Sex and the City"" lite only with brand-name colleges substituting for brand-name clothes. Admitted that kind of campus chic is an improvement over Carries label mania and like the best of the ""Sex"" episodes ""Sisterhood"" is about well sisterhood. (And its also nice that Ferrera and Tamblyn -- the not conventionally pretty stars who had to settle for ""life lessons"" the last time around -- get boyfriends in this installment.) But after the first hour things pall. Ferreras story has some juice but Bledels romantic adventure feels like a leftover from part one. Livelys reconnection with Grandma isnt particularly moving (despite the appearance of the terrific Danner) and although Tamblyn is a winning comic actress her love story is sketchy at best. By the time they all end up in Greece all you can do is check your watch again and check the background nervously for signs of the ""Mamma Mia"" cast. The last half hour is a true crawl but -- as expected -- all ends happily. The romantic types who were looking for love find it. The damaged ones who needed closure find that too. All four girls reconnect with each other and vow never to grow so far apart again. And then they make an even better if bittersweet vow to us. No more sequels.

"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 stars America Ferrera Amber Tamblyn Blake Lively Alexis Bledel - Chicago Tribune Life amp; Style Life amp; Style The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 stars America Ferrera Amber Tamblyn Blake Lively Alexis Bledel Jessica ReavesChicago Tribune reporter In the current popular culture female friendships--at any age--are generally considered secondary to lifes ""important"" relationships the romantic bonds between men and women.Nowhere is this depressing trend more evident than in Hollywood where story lines putatively about womens friendships tend toward the saccharine (""Mona Lisa Smile"") the malicious (""Mean Girls"") or the boy-crazy (take your pick). Which is why its such a pleasure (and a relief) to encounter movies such as "" The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2."" Like the first ""Pants"" movie it presents its heroines relationships as complicated challenging and particularly rewarding and not simply as a vehicle for finding the perfect boyfriend.The four stars of ""Sisterhood"" are back for this smart confident second act based on novels by Anne Brashares. Theyre reprising their roles as best friends who share a remarkable pair of blue jeans--which youll remember mysteriously transforms to fit each of them whenever she needs its powers most. Whether the jeans actually perform miracles or simply boost the wearers self-confidence is a moot point; for teenage girls the latter is akin to the former.As the movie opens we find the friends (Carmen Bridget Tibby and Lena) at the end of their first year in college; Carmen ( America Ferrera appealing as always) still the groups emotional center is looking forward to a summer at home surrounded by her best friends but the others have different plans. Tibby (the enormously talented Amber Tamblyn) is staying in New York to work on her screenplay and Lena ( Alexis Bledel formerly of ""Gilmore Girls"") has signed up for summer classes at the Rhode Island School of Design. Meanwhile Bridget ("" Gossip Girl"" Blake Lively) is off to Turkey on an archeological dig. Stung by the abandonment Carmen joins a high-profile summer stock theater program in Vermont where she is quickly recruited from behind the scenes into the spotlight.Screenwriter Elizabeth Chandler who also penned the first ""Sisterhood"" installment wisely hews close to the formula that made the previous movie a success and director Sanaa Hamri (""Something New"") keeps things moving at a good clip.This is an ensemble piece but the young stars are each entrusted with a complete largely individual story arc a challenge they handle with various degrees of success Tamblyn whose Tibby is sarcastic and very funny is the clear standout imbuing her most brittle exchanges with humor and a tentative warmth. Ferrera taking a break from the relentless cheeriness of "" Ugly Betty"" has become a mature highly nuanced performer. Meanwhile Livelys Bridget is like a sunny day threatened by storm clouds; her slightly manic high spirits feel a bit dangerous. Hers is by far the most dramatic story line and Lively seems a bit overwhelmed at times but she turns in several very nice scenes with Blythe Danner who plays her estranged grandmother. As for Bledel I cant decide if shes an incredibly subtle actor or if shes only capable of two facial expressions (vague confusion and vague happiness). Watching the adventures unfold I was reminded of the "" Sex and the City"" movie--not only because ""Sisterhood also features four independent pointedly distinct characters who arent perfect as friends or as people but who make brave attempts at being the best possible versions of both--but because both films belong to that rare breed movies whose sole focus is a largely realistic iteration of evolving empowering female friendships.Thats not to say there arent boys on the scene; in fact there are plenty of exceptionally cute smart kind guys to be had--in the life drawing class onstage in Vermont and even in Manhattans West Village. But while the romances are great fun to watch they never take over the movie even in their most dramatic angst-ridden moments.And while theres an element of fantasy to much of the movie serious issues including teen pregnancy and mental illness lurk beneath the cinematic sheen.Nothing about this movie feels revolutionary but dont let its easy charm fool you. Like its predecessor ""Sisterhood 2"" is based on two radical ideas namely that young womens stories are about more than the pursuit of men and that happiness isnt something someone else gives you--its something you have to find for yourself.jreavestribune.comMPAA rating PG-13 (for mature material and sensuality).

Alexis Bledel America Ferrera Amber Tamblyn and Blake Lively are shown in a scene from The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. Photo Phil Caruso. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald The magical pants are back on the big screen but is their power fading? Thats the crucial question at the heart of this engaging for-girls-only sequel. The film based on Ann Brashares popular series of novels gets off to a slow start -- its less confusing if youve recently seen the first film -- but turns out to be a lot less tiresome than it sounds aided by a wonderfully appealing cast and a strong message. That fantastical bit about the jeans that fit four BFFs perfectly reflects a real dilemma How to nurture close bonds after graduating high school heading off to different colleges and replacing hands-on friendship with e-mails and occasional phone calls. Narrator Carmen (America Ferrera Ugly Betty) has hopes that the summer after her first year at Yale will be spent with her pals but shes cruelly shocked to learn they have other plans. Athletic Bridget (Blake Lively Gossip Girl) will travel to Turkey to work on an archaeological dig. Artistic Lena (Alexis Bledel Gilmore Girls) and punky Tibby (Amber Tamblyn Joan of Arcadia) will be in New York City the former taking a life-drawing course the latter toiling in a video store and on an assignment to write a romantic-comedy screenplay. Defeated Carmen accepts an invitation to work backstage at an actors colony in Vermont. Mailing the pants to each other throughout the summer will have to take the place of hanging out. Sisterhood follows the usual path of youthful drama Theres a pregnancy scare a tearful family reunion a new brother and a bratty sister. And there are boys fabulous boys boys we all wish had existed when we were 18. One young man is a soulful Greek; another a cheeky Brit who can spout Shakespeare. Two other potential beaus look as though theyve closely followed Mario Lopezs work-out advice. If Sisterhood is but a fantasy at least its a pleasant one. But despite the romantic entanglements which mostly end happily the film is really about the value of friendship. Sex and the City tried to hammer home this message for an older audience earlier this summer but ended up merely touting the joys of unrestrained brand-name shopping. Sisterhood happily for its fans is all about the girl power.

Comments The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 Recommended This sequel improves on the 2005 original about four friends (Alexis Bledel America Ferrera Blake Lively and Amber Tamblyn) who share a lucky pair of faded jeans. Reunited the summer after their freshman year of college the young women find their bond tested by competing interests and a growing seriousness about men. Screenwriter Elizabeth Chandler gracefully condenses three of Ann Brasharess best-selling teen novels striking the right balance between humor and pathos as the characters cope with jealousy heartbreak family conflicts and a pregnancy scare. Sanaa Hamri (Something New) directed; with Rachel Nichols Blythe Danner and Shohreh Aghdashloo. PG-13 117 min.

"Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; sisterhood-of-the-traveling-pants-2-the ) Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 The (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli The strength of The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 like its unnumbered predecessor lies in the appeal and complexity of the characters. The four friends who form the backbone of the narrative are warm believable individuals. We like them. We care about them. Those things are enough to trump the various weaknesses and contrivances associated with their storylines. Part 2 opens by re-introducing us to the main characters and bringing us up to date about what has happened in their lives since we last encountered them. At that time they were between their junior and senior years in high school; now theyre in college. Theyre headed home for the summer but their time together is destined to be short as plans for the break are pulling them in different directions. They are learning the hard way that childhood friendships dont always survive the transition to adulthood and when they do they are changed. The traveling magical pants that somehow fit them all are still being shipped from one girl to the next but their relevance is diminished. (And one wonders after so much time without washing what they smell like.) Lena (Alexis Bledel) is studying painting and after the collapse of her romance with her Greek boyfriend Kostas (Michael Rady) she is exploring the possibility of entering into a new relationship. Carmen (America Ferrera) enters the summer as a stagehand for a theatrical production of Shakespeares ""The Winters Tale"" and ends up auditioning for one of the leads. Tibby (Amber Tamblyn) loses her virginity to her boyfriend and faces the possibility of an unplanned pregnancy (the condom breaks). And Bridget (Blake Lively) goes on an archeological dig in Turkey and ends up discovering some skeletons in her own closet. As with the first film this is more a story of the characters being apart than together. What director Sanaa Hamri and screenwriter Elizabeth Chandler (adapting from the popular series by Ann Brashares) have captured are the changes in young adulthood that mold us into the people we become. One character must confront death another must consider the possibility of being a mother and the others must face romance - all critical elements to the formation of ones personality. The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 is about girls becoming women. Its about four young females discovering where they want to go in life and entering that phase with a mixture of excitement and trepidation. While theres nothing special about any of the mini-dramas that play out during the course of the movie these characters make them compelling and interesting. Credit the actors as much as the screenplay. Since the first The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants only one cast member has experienced a huge rise in profile but her newfound fame as Ugly Betty hasnt impacted America Ferreras portrayal of Carmen. In fact the four returning leads all slip easily into their alter-egos skins. Blake Lively is perhaps a little softer and Alexis Bledel a little flintier but all-in-all the actors provide satisfying versions of the characters they brought to life in 2005 - a little older and wiser perhaps but with the same hearts and souls. Its curious that two of this summers female-oriented movies have featured quartets of best friends. Other than that (and the obvious gender gap in the audience) theres little alike between The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 and Sex and the City. This film has real characters doesnt rely on vulgar humor and doesnt wallow in superficiality. Im not a member of the target demographic for either film but where Sex and the City left me cold and irritated The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 won me over (much as its predecessor did). As chick flicks go this is one men can attend with the expectation that they might just enjoy experiencing two hours alongside these down-to-earth appealing characters.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (Phil Caruso) B+ Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 Genre Comedy Drama; Starring Alexis Bledel America Ferrera Blake Lively Amber Tamblyn; Director Sanaa Hamri; Author Elizabeth Chandler; Release Date Wide 08/06/2008; Runtime (in minutes) 111; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted August 15 2008 -- 1200 AM EDT The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants and its sequel the less elegantly titled Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 both make a good-natured case not only for equality among women but for equality among a far cattier subset up-and-coming starlets. In each film the story -- easily shorthandable as a young-adult version of Sex and the City -- follows the separate adventures of four best teen gal pals as they compulsively mail each other the same pair of ""magic"" vintage jeans. But three years ago in Sisterhood 1 half the cast were way more famous than the other. Back then TV stars Alexis Bledel (Gilmore Girls) and Amber Tamblyn (Joan of Arcadia) were the well-known pair of actresses although youd never know it from the movie which smoothly offered all four performers equal time to be cute freak out about something and literally wear the pants. Perhaps its no shocker given the way Hollywood likes to turn em over but now its the other two members of the sisterhood -- Blake Lively of Gossip Girl and America Ferrera of Ugly Betty -- who are a lot bigger deals outside the multiplex. Once again much to the sequels credit the story doesnt seem to care. The movie keeps moving quickly (but not sloppily) among the heroines so that if youre overloaded say on one sisters sugary plotline it only comes around every fourth scene or so and never sticks around too long. Even at 111 minutes Pants mostly sprints. This time the summer after our heroines first year of college Carmen (Ferrera) arrives at theater camp a backstage tech and -- whaddaya know -- discovers shes a leading lady; Bridget (Lively) ditches an archaeological dig in Turkey to learn more about her dead mother; Tibby (Tamblyn) almost has a breakdown after a bad experience with a two-year-old condom; and Lena (Bledel) wastes time with a fella who (oh no) doesnt believe in the idea of one true love. As with the first movie only two of these plots (this time Tamblyns and Livelys) transcend being kinda silly; the other two are harder to take if youre over the age of 15 and old enough to know how the world really works. But even cynics might concede that again four capable actresses have pulled off a relatively rare thing Theyve convinced us theyre an honest-to-God movie sisterhood.

Pictures The sisterhood Amber Tamblyn left Alexis Bledel America Ferrera and Blake Lively are in college now. SUMMER MOVIE GUIDE By Claudia Puig USA TODAY The saga of the well-worn jeans on the move continues to be a warm and pleasantly diverting tale. With the quartet of girls now in their first year of college The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 (  1/2 out of four) is more of a coming-of-age story than its 2005 predecessor tackling more mature subjects. However for all its moments of believable dialogue and persuasive emotional truths it also has some fairy-tale scenarios. But thats almost a textbook definition of a chick flick so it doesnt interfere much with the films appeal. And the performances of the four young women particularly plucky America Ferrera and sardonic Amber Tamblyn are likable and often charming. Lifting the story a notch are the additions of serious actresses in key roles such as Blythe Danner as Bridgets (Blake Lively) grandmother and Shohreh Aghdashloo as her mentor on an archaeological dig. Family plays a major role. Ferreras character Carmen is coping with her mother having a baby. Tamblyns Tibby has her own trauma revolving around motherhood and Lenas (Alexis Bledels) story is expanded to include her younger sisters feelings of exclusion from the jeans-wearing club. The girls all are embarking on their chosen paths -- filmmaking art theater and archaeology -- and attending prestigious colleges. The movie alternates between their professional pursuits and the girls yearning for romantic connections. In other words the film has lots of cute guys another requirement for a satisfying chick flick. Lena who attends the Rhode Island School of Design strikes up a romance with a handsome fellow student (Jesse Williams). Carmen attending Yale takes a theater job in Vermont and meets a young witty British actor (Tom Wisdom). Tibby at NYU takes her friendship with Brian (Leonardo Nam) in a new direction and writes a screenplay. Bridget on a soccer scholarship to Brown takes a trip to Turkey where she stumbles on personal revelations along with relics. Their friendship feels authentic but the finale doesnt ring true. It seems little more than a crazy moped montage with sun-bleached Greek isle Santorini as a backdrop. Still watching the sequel is like stumbling on a pair of jeans and realizing they still fit comfortably. (Rated PG-13 for mature material and sensuality. Running time 1 hour 51 minutes.

Review Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 Teen drama. Starring Amber Tamblyn America Ferrera Blake Lively Alexis Bledel Blythe Danner and Leonardo Nam. Directed by Sanaa Hamri. (PG-13. 117 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) A pair of secondhand jeans inset with rhinestones plays a major role in ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2."" Anyone who saw the first movie or read the novels that inspired the films will be familiar with these well-worn bottoms. They serve as a bond among four girlfriends. Each can magically squeeze into them although the pals are different sizes and shapes. Their lives already starting to pull apart in the first ""Pants"" diverge further in this thoroughly engaging sequel which has some wisdom to impart but does so softly. With one year of college behind them the girls are on the cusp of becoming adults. Holding on to the past is difficult when the future keeps intruding. To remind themselves of what they had together as best friends they mail the gritty jeans to one another at various summer ports of call. Most exotic is Bridgets (Blake Lively now famous as the star of ""Gossip Girl""). Shes off on an archeological dig in Turkey where she comes to appreciate that the skulls they dig up were once people too. Carmen (Emmy-award winner America Ferrera of ""Ugly Betty"") starts out working backstage at a theater festival in Vermont but is elevated to lead actress. Lena (Alexis Bledel) is an art student whose eyes flutter before they can focus on male nude models and Tibby (Amber Tamblyn) is in Manhattan attempting to finish her first film while clerking at a video store. What elevates ""Pants"" to must-see status for teenage girls is that the opposite sex is peripheral to the foursomes adventures. Theyre terrific role models because they like boys but arent boy crazy the way most Hollywood movies would have portrayed them. Take away the men from ""Sex and the City"" and all thats left are designer shoes and finery. The writer (Elizabeth Chandler whose credits include ""A Little Princess"") and director (newcomer Sanaa Hamri) keep four different but very feminine stories running with no clunky transitions. The girls escapades artfully blend into one another and youre not aware until later of how few scenes the actresses share. Given the juiciest plotline Tamblyn goes for it turning in a hard-boiled performance thats a needed contrast to her co-stars tendency to go for sweet. Tamblyn has that slightly seedy appeal of a film noir heroine. Watch her reaction when Tibbys boyfriend (Leonardo Nam) comes out of the john and tentatively tells her his condom malfunctioned. She seems determined not to let him see how his news devastates her potentially quashing all her plans. Tibby begins dressing like a Goth with deep purple hair and black lace gloves and terrifying customers renting videos. Asked for a romance she suggests the ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" The pants arrive just as Tibby is losing it. She slips into them and practices yoga moves while praying to the jeans for a miracle. They mainly act as a reminder for her to reach out to her buddies which she does with surprising results. Chandlers multilayered script unusually thoughtful for a teen flick returns again and again to the notion that friends are there to offer support. So when Carmen cant get to the hospital to watch her mother give birth because its opening night of her show she calls Tibby who arrives in time to hold Moms hand through the labor and videotape the delivery. And when Lena rejects her Greek boyfriend Tibby Bridget and Carmen descend on a Greek island to make his case for him. ""Pants 2"" feels long for this kind of movie. It would have been tighter and better without a segment about Bridget discovering the Alabama grandmother (Blythe Danner) she thought had deserted her after the suicide of Bridgets mom. This part strays from the main theme of how the residuals of longtime friendships keep paying like a pair of pants that arrive in the mail just when theyre needed. -- Advisory Mild sexuality.

In the three years since the first ""Traveling Pants"" was adapted from one of Anne Brashears novels two of its little-known ensemble of four have become TV stars - America Ferrara on ""Ugly Betty"" and Blake Lively on ""Gossip Girl."" PHOTO GALLERY The Sisterhood Of The Traveling Pants 2 PHOTO GALLERY The Sisterhood Of The Traveling Pants 2 Premiere Surprisingly theyre not rewarded with the juiciest of the four intersecting story lines drawn from three other Brashears novels. After a difficult freshman year at Yale Ferraras perennial outsider Carmen is looking forward to a reunion with her buddies. But all three have other summer plans though they pledge to continue mailing the same pair of jeans back and forth between each other. So Carmen accompanies a pal from the Yale drama school to a Vermont theater camp where she expects to work backstage. But thanks to a hunky Brit named Ian (Tom Wisdom) the insecure Carmen ends up auditioning for the director (Kyle MacLachlan) and playing opposite the hunk in a production of ""A Winters Tale"" - much to the annoyance of her WASPy roommate (Rachel Nicols). Livelys Bridget a student at Brown is on an archaeological dig in Turkey overseen by a professor (Shoreh Agdashloo) who helps Bridget understand that shes still shaken by her moms suicide - and needs to reconnect with her moms mom (Blythe Danner) in Georgia. Libby (Amber Tamblyn) meanwhile is a struggling NYU student working at the Two Boots video store - and her relationship with a classmate (Leonardo Tam) is threatened by a possible pregnancy. Lena (Alexis Bledel) studying figure drawing at the Rhode Island School of Design has a crush on a hunky model (Jesse Williams) - while still carrying a torch for the boyfriend who married someone else in Greece. The girls bicker bond bicker - but their bonds are inevitably as indestructible as those jeans and as inevitable as the movie seasons second big romantic climax on a Greek island. No singing this time though. Sensitively directed by Sanaa Hamri ""The Sister of the Traveling Pants 2"" demonstrates that not only is sisterhood powerful it can be awfully entertaining. THE SISTERHOOD OF THE TRAVELING PANTS 2 You go girls Running time 111 minutes. Rated PG-13 (mature material and sensuality). At the Empire the Kips Bay the Battery Park City others.

Elizabeth Weitzman Tuesday August 5 2008 614 PM What a difference a few years make. When ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" came out in 2005 Alexis Bledel (""Gilmore Girls"") and Amber Tamblyn (""Joan of Arcadia"") had to fit the film into their schedules while Blake Lively and America Ferrera were lucky to get the gig. Now thanks to ""Gossip Girl"" and ""Ugly Betty"" the latter two are bound to be the bigger draws. Fortunately this unexpected shift hasnt affected the stars chemistry; if anything it only makes their story of a tumultuous but enduring friendship feel a little sweeter.While the actresses are busy trading power their characters are still doing the same with a pair of jeans that magically fits each girl. But when the sequel begins theyre scattered at various colleges and can barely even remember why they bother passing around an old pair of pants. Only Ferreras Carmen seems upset by their growing distance especially when no one else wants to reunite come summer vacation. Of course she doesnt yet know that individual crises will bring them back together. The reason this franchise has been so successful - both on film and in Ann Brashares original novels - is that just like the jeans it suits the needs of vastly different girls. Whether theyre looking for romance struggling through family issues or simply trying on different identities theyll find their own experiences reflected onscreen. Then again no matter how serious the subject matter this is an unabashed fantasy for tweens and teens. The boys are cute the parents learn to be supportive the mean girl gets her due. But unlike most so-called ""chick flicks"" ""Sisterhood"" never talks down to its heroines or reduces them to dismissive cliches. Every woman - regardless of her age - has a favorite pair of jeans she wishes would last forever. Its still easy to see why ""Sisterhoods"" young fans feel the same about this series. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Hello sisters Alexis Bledel America Ferrera Amber Tamblyn and Blake Lively. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Its been three summers since we first met the foursome of friends in the film version of ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants."" The sequel finds the girls a bit older now in college. But sadly theyre no wiser -- in fact they seem to have regressed. Based on Ann Brashares series of young-adult books the story is bound by a pair of jeans that mysteriously fit all four friends -- were told but never shown that they even flatter the zaftig Carmen (America Ferrera). As in the original film the girls keep in touch throughout their respective summer adventures by mailing the supposedly magical pants to each other. Also the drama continues to revolve around the friends inability to talk about their problems. However unlike the sparkly first film (directed by Ken Kwapis) this version (by Sanaa Hamri better known for making music videos) socks the young women with a series of problems that may leave viewers scratching their heads. The film certainly looks contemporary -- characters come readily equipped with cell phones and some of the friends indulge in the au courant practice of interracial dating. Why then doesnt Tibby (Amber Tamblyn) by now a funky seemingly street-smart film student at NYU seek emergency contraception the moment her boyfriends condom breaks? And whats the deal with Carmens disdain for e-mail? The first installment was as watchable as any warm-hearted teen drama Carmen was reunited with her deadbeat dad while Tibby befriended a spunky 12-year-old dying of leukemia. But the only meat to this second helping involves Bridget (""Gossip Girl"" superstar Blake Lively) who continues to wrestle with her mothers suicide. Other than this the sequel coasts on flimsy and/or benign narratives that involve postponed adulthood cute boys who speak with deadened unvarying inflections and ignorance of modern conveniences. All the while a cloying musical score tries to enlist the empathy of viewers who should know better. Members of the sisterhood are often getting upset for one baffling reason or another. Ferreras jittery character in particular -- in this film shes cast as Perdita in a summer-stock production of ""The Winters Tale"" -- makes mountains out of molehills. Shes not likable whatsoever. After an hour or so of watching her moan pout and otherwise get irritated by trivial matters (including the fact that her best girlfriends lack ESP) the viewer might rather stick pins in her eyes than feel affection for such a tedious self-pitying young woman. THE SISTERHOOD OF THE TRAVELING PANTS 2  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for mature material and sensuality. Christy DeSmith is a Minneapolis freelance writer.

By  Lisa Kennedy PUBLISHED August 4 2008 at 1257 pm | UPDATED May 7 2016 at 919 am Sign up for newsletters and alerts Submit your news tips or photos Most Popular Donald Trump stumps in Colorado promises ""No more Mr. Nice Guy"" Chris Harris INT injuries and 8 other observations from Day 2 of Broncos training camp Broncos offensive line can live with the blame game. Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post A younger different fab foursome is back. No they didnt leap from the small screen to the big but from Ann Brashares young adult novels about Tibby Carmen Lena and Bridget. In 2005s ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" nonreaders of the popular books learned the girls were linked first by their mothers (who met in an aerobics class for pregnant women) and then by an usual pair of blue jeans. The embroidered sequined denim fit each girl perfectly. Over the course of a summer the pants were passed from character to character with powerful effect. This sequel finds the quartet half-heartedly committed to the ritual of the pants and pursuing new goals after their first year of college. Their are no slackers here Tibby attends New York University artist Lena goes to Rhode Island School of Design Blake is studying at Brown and Carmen is a Yalie. Youve got to admire a franchise targeted to adolescent girls that is hiply aware of its characters humor and hankerings and isnt the least bit embarrassed by their smarts and achievements. Although they may be. For instance Carmen (America Ferrera) is far too content to work backstage at a summer-stock theater. Its handsome Ian (Tom Wisdom) who insists she play his leading lady. Long before she arrives in Vermont with classmate Julia (Rachel Nichols) Carmen sets the tone for the lifelong friends adventures with a voice-over ""We had to learn on our own how to become ourselves . . . without losing each other."" The filmmakers give the characters relatable quandaries without sacrificing gloss. Its just plain impossible to make Greek isles anything but storybook-beckoning. There are a lot of balls to keep in the air in this follow-up. And not just for the young women who face the challenges of lost love and new attraction (Lena) parental death (Bridget) finding a sense of place (Carmen) and unexpected consequences (Tibby). Director Sanaa Hamri (who charmed with the romantic comedy ""Something New"") and writer Elizabeth Chandler remain devoted to tracing the arc of each character which as their lives become even more complex can make for crammed storytelling and hurried resolution. On a trip back to Santorini Lena (Alexis Bledel) runs into Kostas (Michael Rady) who is no longer available. She returns to summer classes and discovers with sweet tentativeness kind hazel-eyed Leo (Jesse Williams in a promising film debut). Blakes time with her estranged grandmother and a would-be mentor on an archaeological dig feel mildly truncated. But its good Blythe Danner and Shohreh Aghdashloo play those forces of nurture. Amber Tamblyn provides an anti-""Juno"" moment many parents have been craving since the teen- pregnancy comedy. The 19-year- olds plans and sense of independence are turned upside down after a latex malfunction. What happens to Tibby and devoted boyfriend Brian (Leonardo Lam) although cautionary unfolds with anguished heart and agile humor. Tamblyn and Ferrera are especially appealing here. But in a film that depends as much on chemistry as individual effort the sisterhood of the pants remains strong. ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2"" Young Chick Flick  Rating PG for mature material and sensuality. 1 hour 51 minutes. Directed by Sanaa Hamri; written by Elizabeth Chandler; from the book by Ann Brashares; photography by Jim Denault; starring Amber Tamblyn Alexis Bledel America Ferrera Blake Lively Rachel Nichols Tom Wisdom Rachel Ticotin Leonardo Lam Michael Rady Jesse Williams Blythe Danner.

I foresee a similar fate for its blandly engaging sequel moms daughters and faux-ironic twentysomethings filling the theaters the rest of us filling our jammies and DVD players in six months. New director Sanaa Hamri reunites the cast who keep the more trepidatious viewers shame-o-meter in check with genuinely appealing performances Back are Alexis Bledel and her primly knitted brow; Amber Tamblyns delightfully transparent hardass rap; America Ferreras earnest wounded mother hen; and Blake Livelys thoroughbred lope. A year at Ivy League colleges has forged some cracks among the foursome and the theme of that first painful breach among formative cronies is surprisingly acute despite the soapy flourishes (multiple false pregnancies a grandma resurrection courtly confusions) that its target audience will eat up with a spoon. The conceit of the magical denim conduit quickly fades into the background as the girls--apart now not just for the summer but the foreseeable future--grapple with the implications of losing touch and growing up and whether those might be the same thing.

Sisterhood 2 tracks the lonely summer after freshman year that challenging season when you no longer fit in your parents home. When you struggle to find your place without the friends who sustained you through high school. And when you know that though you have to go it alone its easier with a little help from your friends - in the form of those charmed denims that serendipitously fit all of you. Director Sanaa Hamri (Something New) gets appealing performances from Alexis Bledel America Ferrera Blake Lively and Ambler Tamblyn (respectively TVs Gilmore Girl Ugly Betty Gossip Girl and Joan of Arcadia) more nuanced actresses than they were in 2005. Hamri and returning screenwriter Elizabeth Chandler skillfully juggle multiple locations and story lines each of which shows a sister wrestling her primal fear. Shy Lena (Bledel) at Rhode Island School of Design is drawn to a male model who poses in her life-drawing class. Insecure Carmen (Ferrera) one year in at Yale is toiling backstage in summer stock when she gets pushed in front of the curtain. In-denial Bridget (Lively) a Brown student working on an archaeological dig in Turkey excavates her grief about her mothers death. Noncommital Tibby (Tamblyn) NYU aspiring filmmaker shrinks from a beau (Leonardo Nam) who wants commitment. As each hogs the spotlight in her own personal melodrama she forgets to take her turn in the ensemble of the sisterhood. The resulting drama is more deeply felt than it is deep. But I cant think of another film so frankly dealing with what we expect from friendship so tenderly showing how friends can fail in one area yet be there in another. This isnt Mean Girls; its Keen Girls with standout performances from Ferrera and Tamblyn each of whom expresses more with an arched eyebrow than most actresses can with their entire bodies. Given the general thrust of movies about teenage girls its refreshing that in this one the prize isnt the Boy or the Ring. Sisterhood 2s four-girls-four configuration naturally invites comparison with Sex and the City. But despite Sisterhoods PG-13 rating (for discreet discussion of pregnancy and mental illness - and discreet pans across the male form) its closer to Second Base and the City appropriate for 11-year-olds and their grandmothers.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

(Phil CARUSO/warner bros.) Email|Print|Single Page| Text size - + By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / August 6 2008 The only title more unlikely than ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" is ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2."" Wait you mean those faded jeans are still out there with all the customized doodads and the magical ability to fit Ugly Betty the former Joan of Arcadia and two CW girls (one Gossip one ex-Gilmore)? Arent these ladies too old for this? They are and in this crowded borderline epic sequel to the 2005 hit theyre thinking about folding the pants for good.The jeans were an authentic unifying device in the first film equalizing and harmonizing four very different women. In a bitchy mean-girls era these four seemed like sincere friends. The second installment which like the first is based on Ann Brasharess book series is watchable despite its tedious weave of stock plots. The movie finds the sisterhood in that awkward summer between college freshman and sophomore years when high school relationships suffer neglect at the prospect of an expanded socio-extracurricular universe. Youd think a Facebook account might solve some of that angst but this is a world where people are lackadaisical about sending and reading e-mails. The movie is old-fashioned that way - very 2005.Tibby (Amber Tamblyn) has a pregnancy scare with her boyfriend (Leonardo Nam) while taking an NYU screenwriting course (will she use her experience to write ""Juno 2""?). Bridget (Blake Lively) goes on an archaeological dig discovers letters her father has hidden from her and heads from Turkey to Alabama. Lena (Alexis Bledel) is caught between the advances of the nude model (Jesse Williams) in her RISD drawing class and the remorse of her first love Kostos (Michael Rady) now like a walking episode of ""Guiding Light."" Poor Carmen (America Ferrera) is woebegone that her pals dont want to spend the summer together and heads to drama camp where shes embroiled in a Disney Channel version of ""All About Eve"" opposite the Yale classmate (Rachel Nichols) who invited her.Directing from Elizabeth Chandlers script Sanaa Hamri takes over from Ken Kwapis and she generates familiar human warmth. Shes also raised the number of interracial relationships and without the fuss of her previous interracial romance ""Something New."" But in oscillating among all these plots arguments fantasies and pratfalls (""I just fell off a donkey"") the movie drags something awful. The films climax takes us with hilarious ease to a seaside village in Greece and its disappointing to say the least; you come all this way and not one ABBA song.The adults who show up to guide and inspire are distinguished enough Kyle MacLachlan swishing it up at drama camp Blythe Danner regal in Alabama Shohreh Aghdashloo wise and glamorous in archeological safari wear Rachel Ticotin underused again as Carmens mom. The real trouble is that Tamblyn Lively Bledel and Ferrera while lovely in their respective sections on ""Traveling Pants 2"" make the greatest sense together the hugging the fighting the sitting around staring out at the sea. What they have goes beyond basic chemistry. They seem spiritually fused and at this point exceedingly womanly. In the intervening years theyve become pretty good actors too. Now wheres the filmmaker wholl give them more to do than pregnancy scares and falls off donkeys? (c) Copyright 2008 Globe Newspaper Company.

And they still travel _ to New York and Vermont Turkey and Greece and various points in between. But the magic in those jeans and in the bond that linked the friends whove shared them over the years seems to have faded in ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2."" The sequel to 2005s surprisingly tolerable ""Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" finds our eclectic group of heroines a little bit older and wiser and a lot less connected despite the promise they made to ship the jeans to each other along with a note containing the juicy details of their latest adventures. Now they barely have time to dash off an e-mail saying hi. Makes sense that theyd go off to college and begin forming separate lives but the film from director Sanaa Hamri (""Something New"") taking over for Ken Kwapis feels disjointed too. It bounces from one girls story line to anothers without much tonal cohesion and it doesnt help that the situations the characters find themselves in are often soapy and contrived. (The script from Elizabeth Chandler is based on the second third and fourth books of Ann Brashares series of novels.) And because they spend so little time talking laughing and bonding it depletes the sequel of much of the originals spark. Part of the allure of the first film came from watching these women support each other no matter what in a way that was real and believable without feeling too treacly. Imagine how ""Sex and the City"" would play if its four stars never got together to dish. One consistency remains though America Ferrera pretty much steals the whole movie out from under her co-stars as the quick-witted Carmen whos now studying drama at Yale. Ferrera is an actress with a likable accessible presence who always makes her performances look effortless _ thats something we knew even before she became the Emmy-winning star of TVs ""Ugly Betty"" but her charms only seem to strengthen as she grows older and more seasoned. Carmen who also serves as our narrator again had hoped to spend the summer after her freshman year back home in Bethesda Md. with her three best girlfriends. Instead she ends up working backstage at a Vermont theater company when it becomes obvious that everyone else has made other plans _ and she finds herself making an unexpected star turn much to the annoyance of the WASPy drama queen (Rachel Nichols) whod invited her there. Tragic Tibby (Amber Tamblyn) is at NYU film school and somewhere along the way transformed herself into a goth version of Liza Minnelli. She doles out snarky unsolicited advice to customers at the video store where she works (and gets a few amusing lines in there) but her relationship with nice-guy Brian (Leonardo Nam returning from the first film) has turned suddenly serious. (Her plot line is the one that veers the most drastically all over the place.) Gorgeous tomboy Bridget (Blake Lively who has some fresh clout of her own as the star of ""Gossip Girl"") is playing soccer at Brown and still struggling to heal from her mothers suicide. As she continues to run from herself in painfully symbolic fashion she jets off to Turkey to volunteer at an archaeological dig. There she receives some insightful advice from a professor (Shohreh Aghdashloo) which inspires her to seek out the grandmother (Blythe Danner) she barely knows in hopes of learning about her own past. And quiet Lena (Alexis Bledel) is an art student at the Rhode Island School of Design. (Wait a second. All four of them got into selective top-notch schools? No one ended up at community college or waiting tables? This really is a fantasy.) Lenas still heartbroken over the way things ended with her first love Kostos (Michael Rady) on the Greek island of Santorini. Or at least shes supposed to be heartbroken _ Bledel is so ethereally placid its hard to tell. But she does get a second chance at romance with the sexy model from her drawing class (newcomer Jesse Williams). Stuff happens feelings are hurt boys dramatically enter and leave their lives and major problems wrap up a bit too neatly especially at the picturesque ending. That ""Traveling Pants 2"" offers material thats tailored to an underserved audience _ girls and women who like films that allow them to think and feel _ is of course a solid start. You just wish it were a more comfortable fit. ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2"" a Warner Bros. release is rated PG-13 for mature material and sensuality. Running time 111 minutes. Two stars out of four. ___ Motion Picture Association of America rating definitions G _ General audiences. All ages admitted. PG _ Parental guidance suggested.

In this sequel to the charming 2005 flick the four young women from the first film are now college age. Their lives are moving in different directions and they are spending the summer apart. Spunky sensitive Carmen (America Ferrera) lands a gig working at a Vermont theater where she develops a budding relationship with a charming British actor (played by not-as-charming-as-he-thinks Tom Wisdom). Resilient Lena (Alexis Bledel) is bouncing back from a broken heart by studying art in Rhode Island. She has a romance with a handsome student who moonlights as nude model (Jesse Williams); dont worry parents the movie stays firmly in PG-13 territory. Tibby (Amber Tamblyn) an edgy artistic type moves her relationship with a male pal to the next level which creates some amusing complications once she thinks she is pregnant. The only one of the Pants crew without man trouble is Bridget (Blake Lively from TVs Gossip Girl). She starts out in Turkey working on an archaeological dig before heading back to the States to reunite with a grandmother (Blythe Danner) she hasnt seen since childhood. It seems like thered be enough meat from all these story lines to mine some genuine emotion. Instead the movie drifts along in a rather aimless and haphazard fashion. At one point you even expect the credits to roll but the film carries on for another 20 minutes as the women jaunt off to Greece to search for the blue jeans featured in the title. The multiple story lines arent helped along by the clumsy direction by Sanaa Hamri (Something New) or the Elizabeth Chandler screenplay which blends events from different books in the popular young-adult series by Ann Brashares. That could be why Bridgets summer is so overstuffed while Lenas adventures are rather skimpy. Lenas romance with the model also is resolved in a puzzling fashion as if a page from the script was missing but the actors simply kept on going. Despite the flaws the movie is reasonably pleasant most of the time. Some of that is leftover goodwill from the first film but it is also a tribute to the four starring actresses. They manage to be quite appealing even when theyre not given a lot to work with. Reach the reporter at randy .cordovaarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849.

With very little sex and very little city ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2"" still seems a good bet to grab a sizable chunk of the underserved chick-flick demographic boosted by its young stars blossoming profiles (particularly ""Gossip Girls"" Blake Lively) and a blithely shallow approach to story. A likable quartet of players a surfeit of male bimbos and an appetite for quick-cooked emotion should make the Aug. 6 Warner Bros. release a bigger hit than its 2005 predecessor which grossed 39 million domestically. Adapted (like the first film) by Elizabeth Chandler from the novels by Ann Brashares pic finds our girls no longer girls Bridget (Lively) is playing soccer at Brown; Tibby (Amber Tamblyn) is at NYU film school; Lena (Alexis Bledel) is attending the Rhode Island School of Design; and Carmen (America Ferrera) is miserable at Yale. ""I was lost without them"" Carmen says of her friends during the treacly recap of events since the last movie. Carmen is expecting them all to reunite for the summer but her pals have other plans. Tibby has summer school in Manhattan. Lena is taking a drawing class where she meets hunky model Leo (Jesse Williams) who may help her forget her true love Kostos (Michael Rady). Bridget is going on an archeological dig in Turkey where she meets the inspiring Professor Mehani (Shohreh Aghdashloo) gets to dress herself from Barneys Antiquities Excavation Collection and thinks about how much she misses her grandmother (Blythe Danner). So Carmen accepts an invitation to a Vermont theater camp from a Yale classmate Julia (Rachel Nichols) whos far too blonde and Waspy not to eventually turn evil. (Along with sisterhood pic isnt afraid to embrace galloping cliche.) There Carmen assumes the backstage role she was playing at Yale until shes brought out of the wings by the hunky Brit-accented Ian (Tom Wisdom). Cast as Perdita in ""A Winters Tale"" Carmen blooms like a Shakespearean rose. Ferrera gives by far the best performance in the film -- Lively is all mannerism and smoky looks Tamblyn is doing shtick inspired by Liza Minnelli and Joan Blondell and Bledel is fine if prettily unengaging. But as great as she is Ferrera is not a classical actress and the enthusiasm that greets her every Elizabethan utterance is a bit hard to swallow. But ""Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2"" is about pleasability not plausibility. Meanwhile the pants keep traveling In the original the girls found a pair of dungarees that mysteriously fit their disparate physiques (through it must be assumed jean-etic mutation) and stay in touch with each others rapidly changing worlds by FedExing the garment back and forth. What the pants will do when confronted by a pregnant member of the sisterhood becomes an issue -- in fact its the issue since every other crisis in the film is basically much ado about nothing. Eventually the pants bring them all to a gloriously shot Greece where Lena will have to resolve things with Kostos whos either married or not (its hard to say). Helmer Sanaa Hamri (""Something New"") exposes her musicvideo roots in the glib way she and d.p. Jim Denault use the four young stars as props and arrange the storys emotionally wrenching moments as if they were peaks in a bowl of whipped cream. Its all largely eye candy especially the men although this can be forgiven Women have a long enough history of being superficial in the movies and a little payback is perfectly understandable.
