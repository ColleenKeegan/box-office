When his handler is killed in a Taliban ambush Max the Belgian Malinois (nope me neither but apparently its similar to an Alsatian) is shipped home and adopted by the dead mans family in North Carolina. Younger brother Justin (Josh Wiggins) is a teenage delinquent in the making fighting with his dad (Thomas Haden Church) and hacking video games on the sly for a gang of local hoodlums. Will Maxs arrival help to knit the family together and teach this troubled kid what it means to be a man? What do you think? Chucking in Mexican gun-runners BMX chases Rottweiler attacks and the least convincing teenage romance in film history this is a busy moderately entertaining slice of family-friendly fluff. Its flatly directed and functionally acted - as just Justin Wiggins is just this side of obnoxious while Church is outperformed by his own moustache as the dad - and the story never really goes anywhere interesting. For British audiences however therell be one striking moment of cultural disconnect as a Fourth of July parade sequence features a military marching band playing a stirring brassy version of Tubthumping by anarchist crusties Chumbawamba.

It isnt very original but they worked hard to make it a great movie and they succeeded.  The bind shown between dog and handler is what I believe to be true especially after reading ""Sergeant Rex"" by Lance Corporal Mike Dowling (USMC Ret.) and having a dog of my own.  You become emotionally attached to this dog and if anything happens to him that lovable doggie smile draws you into the movie even more hoping that he will be okay and what will happen next.  Although this movie does use that adorable smile as a crutch sometimes it is otherwise an amazing movie and is one of the best I have seen.

"Max - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Max Posted by Christy Lemire on June 29 2015 19 Comments Warner Bros. Pictures Rated PG for action violence peril brief language and some thematic elements. Running time 111 minutes. One and a half stars out of four. ""Max"" is a strange beast. It is in theory a family-friendly movie about courage and friendship with a brave and handsome military search dog at its center. Who doesnt like dogs? What could possibly go wrong? In reality though ""Max"" is an absurdly violent PG-rated movie in which kids and dogs are repeatedly in peril -- and often the potential targets for gunfire. Theres also death in the line of duty a familys mourning a weapons-smuggling ring involving bad guys from both sides of the Mexican border a kidnapping a near drowning and some massive explosions. At one point my 5 1/2-year-old son Nicolas -- who loves dogs and goes out of his way to say hi to every single one he sees in our neighborhood -- turned to me during the screening and said ""This movie is too violent."" He was right -- and in retrospect Nic was too young for ""Max."" But beyond the potentially frightening material director and co-writer Boaz Yakins film is just a weird hodgepodge of themes and plot threads. Its an earnestly patriotic movie about sacrifice for ones country clearly aimed at conservative Christian audiences. But it also features a character whos way too willing to share classified information with a teenager. It has its heartwarming moments and even some thrilling ones as that teenager and the dog learn to work together trust each other and share spirited adventures. But its also about overcoming racial prejudices and owning up to oft-repeated untruths. Its also just not very good -- and no amount of swelling inspiring music can convince you otherwise. Yakin (""Remember the Titans"") working from a script he co-wrote with Sheldon Lettich veers between all these heavy ideas in ungainly fashion for the films nearly-two-hour running time. But he begins with the wholesome image of Kyle Wincott (Robbie Amell from ""The DUFF"") a good-looking Marine and dog handler whos been deployed to Afghanistan enjoying a Skype chat with his parents back home in small-town East Texas. His father Ray (a glum and gruff Thomas Haden Church) is a Marine veteran himself who suffered a debilitating leg injury during Desert Storm. (Strangely despite the frequent mention of the leg we dont see it a single time.) His mother Pamela (a sadly understated and underused Lauren Graham) is the familys dutiful and God-fearing matriarch. But Kyles younger brother Justin (Josh Wiggins) has no interest in chatting. Hed rather play video games about war then bootleg them for his friends for profit. Hes so sick of being compared to his superstar older brother that hes gone out of his way to be as different -- and underachieving -- as possible. Surely some life lessons are in store for this wayward young man. They come early in one of the movies many multi-hanky moments when Kyle is killed under mysterious circumstances in battle. At his funeral Max -- the brave and highly trained Belgian Malinois whod been his constant trusty companion -- bursts through the back door of the church stands on his hind legs to whimper over Kyles American flag-draped coffin then lies down loyally on the ground in front of it. But as Maxs trainer at the base (Jay Hernandez) informs the family this brilliant dog refuses to respond to anyone anymore and might have to be euthanized. Cosmically though he has a connection with Justin. At first the disaffected teen has zero interest in helping until the all-night barking and whimpering become too much to bear. Justin learns to retrain Max with the aid of his good friend the sassy Chuy (Dejon LaQuake) and Chuys brash and beautiful cousin Carmen (Mia Xilali) whos been around dogs all her life. This is the section in which ""Max"" really hits its stride with the three kids working together and forming a heartwarming bond with a beautiful creature. But soon the movie veers off course into some strange and dangerous territory as Justin and his pals suspect Kyles longtime friend and fellow Marine Tyler (Luke Kleintank) is up to no good. Tylers secret meetings in the woods with leather-clad baddies are a sure sign as are the drooling growling Rottweilers accompanying these men. (Max finds himself brawling with these muscular canines a couple times to protect Justin and his friends which is extremely hard to watch.) Suddenly this warmly old-fashioned kid-adventure movie has turned into something much colder and darker. If theres any useful lesson to come out of ""Max"" its that dogs can suffer fron post-traumatic stress disorder too. In one of the films more artful and emotionally effective sequences Max paces about nervously in his backyard crate as multicolored July 4th fireworks explode overhead. In one of many sensitive moments from Wiggins Justin finds the heart to climb inside and soothe him. Its a rare and cutting bit of truth in a movie thats too-often smothered in nostalgic Americana.

Really? You are a horrible critic. I bet ya wouldnt know what a meaningful story was if it bit ya in the face. It was a VERY good movie. Yes. A little too violent but not enough to make it PG-13. It is a PG meaning ""Parental Guidance"". You being a mother to your 5.5 yr old are His Parental Guidance. I give this a 9/10. Never gonna consider your so called ""critic"" review for all future movie goings. Reply July 3 2015  by  Accipiter     Did you bother reading the review at all or did you simply stop when you saw ""its also not very good""? The reviewer explains why she felt the film wasnt good and theyre all very accurate observations. Just because she disliked a movie you enjoyed doesnt make her a horrible critic. Reply July 16 2015  by  Chris     yes it is Reply July 6 2015  by  lea     I agree with you Reply July 12 2015  by  More than just Merica     I just finished watching this movie and I agree. Its really bad writing and the best actor in the whole thing were the dogs that played Max. Get through the gross Merica-ness and actually watch it next time if you want to pay to see it again. Reply June 29 2015  by  Paula     I thought it was an awful movie. It was full of punk kids guns fighting dogs a so-called marine who gives marines a bad name liars violent Mexicans who only want guns and contraband and bad acting. I took my 11-year-old daughter and we should have left halfway through. We wanted Homeward bound to come up on the screen Felt sorry for the Rotties who were hurt then poor Max got pretty beat up too. It was a dark movie a waste of money IMHO. Reply July 3 2015  by  Accipiter     Im glad Im not the only one who noticed the awful acting. Whenever the main character was sad he had this glowering expression that looked like he was going to murder someone. The banter between the friend and cousin was painfully out of touch as if some middle-aged writer tried to imagine how kids these days talk. The mediocre plot could have been salvaged if theyd simply hired some better actors. Reply July 6 2015  by  lea     what. I disagree Reply October 11 2015  by  Terri     I have a Rottie and I was very disappointed how they showed them as the typical stereotype and not at all pleased to watch this poor dog either chained to the backyard or forced to live in a small crate in the backyard. Reply July 2 2015  by  Memo     why Hunger Games is PG-13? honestly is not that violent compare to what teens are playing in video games in our days. From my point of view it is a movie to highly recommend. True life story and meaningful teachings out of it. Reply July 3 2015  by  Sid Blackwelder     You said its a patriotic movie clearly aimed at Conservative and Christians. So now the leftists are ADMITTING they arent patriotic. Reply July 3 2015  by  Accipiter     ...huh? What does that have to do with anything? I consider myself mostly liberal and I didnt like the movie because of poor acting and Hallmark-channel level production and script not because of the subject matter. I was really looking forward to seeing a movie about a military dog. I went into the movie hoping to enjoy it. Just because a movie disappoints you doesnt mean its because of your political leaning. Reply July 11 2015  by  D     This critic did not understand this wonderful captivating movie. That showed a heroic military dog that was loyal not only to his handler but to his kid brother a troubled teed that the dog rescues. This wonderful dog not only saves the kid brother but the whole family and also saves a cache of stolen weapons from falling into the hands of the cartel. People erupted into applause at the conclusion of this movie. I think this movie critic needs to get a new job because she failed horrible on this one. Yes I read the entirety of her dribble before I went to the movie. Reply July 13 2015  by  M     I also do not agree with this critic I thought it was a wonderful movie and my family really enjoyed it As far as being too violent I guess thats the parents call but we live in what seems to be an increasingly violent world and sheltering children to the real dangers and evils of it will not do them any favors in the long run. Im glad I didnt base my decision to watch this on critics opinions because I might have missed out on a great movie Reply July 16 2015  by  Matt     I havent seen this film but I have seen the trailer. The trailer makes it obvious that this film is not appropriate for a 5 year old. Bringing a 5 year old to this film shows an extreme lack of judgement. Reply July 16 2015  by  Chris     I dont take people like you seriously... violet? its as violet as a fucking cartoon your child watch and you dont see the ""death"" of the solider at all you brought you almost six year old son to watch a movie.... and you were inspecting a Disney movie Hack even airbud had its moments dog being drop of its turck? being tied up with over drunk clown who abuses his down with the papers and what more not? a dog who seriously.... didnt trust humans and you whine about this movie? its blockbuster movie? No its good movie? yes Reply September 18 2015  by  Jenn     I havent seen the movie yet - but who would let a 5 1/2 year-old go to see a movie like that anyway? It says PG-13 not G. Wow. Reply September 18 2015  by  Christy Lemire     Well every kid is different right? And different kids can handle different kinds of material. My son happens to have seen a lot more movies -- and a wider variety of movies -- than most kids his age and so he has the perspective to notice when something seems especially scary or intense. It looked like a heartwarming movie about a dog (and he loves dogs). I wanted to help other folks by letting them know whats in store for them. But thanks for your concern about my parenting abilities. Reply November 1 2015  by  Quinley     This movie was about dogs used through history in wartime situations - well thats the message I got anyway. But as it was not a documentary it needed some type of plot. A hero some villains children a family crises and a love of a country. Now where do you find all of those and put them together. My wife asked me if this was a Disney movie. I told her I didnt think Disney would produce such a waste of two hours. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

MANORI RAVINDRAN Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 26 2015 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Jun. 26 2015 843AM EDT Comments AA Directed by Boaz Yakin Written by Boaz Yakin and Sheldon Lettich Starring Thomas Haden Church Josh Wiggins Lauren Graham Classification PG Country USA Language English For a certain generation of filmgoers 1957s Old Yeller was an agonizing step into adulthood. The Disney film about an ill-fated Mastiff-Labrador in post-Civil War Texas was in a word cataclysmal. But it was also an essential lesson in life and death (and pet vaccinations) and bluntly challenged young audiences with a universal truth. The fourth film in the Mad Max franchise starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron lands in theatres on May 15. Movie Preview Summer movie preview From Fantastic Four to Poltergeist 19 flicks coming your way Arent you a lilttle short to be a storm trooper? Cosplayers take part in a Star Wars Day fan event in Tokyo on May 4 celebrated as Star Wars Day by fans of the film franchise. REUTERS Multimedia Star Wars Day Whats going on today in a galaxy not so far far away Decades on the success of My Dog Skip Shiloh and Marley amp; Me signals an enduring appeal in a film about a boy and his oft-in-peril dog. Max the canine offering from Remember the Titans director Boaz Yakin is no different. Nudging the genre along with mixed results Yakin gives us the expected animal hijinks adventure and pure blissed-out Americana filmgoers expect of the subgenre alongside a contemporary edge that attempts to examine the effects of war.We first meet Max a smart-looking Belgian Malinois in Kandahar where he works as a precision-trained military dog alongside his handler U.S. Marine Kyle Wincott (Robbie Amell). An introductory sequence tells us that Max is one of 3000 dogs working for American troops across Iraq and Afghanistan.Shortly after while the troop is out on manoeuvres Kyles childhood friend and fellow Marine Tyler (Luke Kleintank) fails to heed the dogs warning to hold back and an ensuing enemy attack kills Kyle. Suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder Max returns stateside where he is in danger of being put down until Kyles mother - played by small-screen adolescent-whisperer Lauren Graham - insists the family adopt him during a kennel visit after the dog instantly bonds with the Marines surviving brother Justin (Josh Wiggins).Although at first Justin would rather play Mortal Kombat it is an historic fact that not even mercurial teenagers are impervious to the affections of a pointy-eared dog and the pair grow predictably close. Harmony is shortlived however when Tyler returns home and prompts Justin to question what happened to his brother overseas throwing the family into danger with local arms dealers (yes) and culminating in an improbable action-packed third act that serves up heroic antics across the board.While the structural shortcomings in family-friendly films about animals are often discounted for what is often a purely emotional connection sought by viewers Yakin doesnt condescend to his audience and infuses his plot with a surprisingly ambitious and revealing commentary about the experience of war.Tyler for instance is heavily disillusioned by Afghanistan upon his return - an anger that ultimately motivates criminal behaviour - while Justin clashes with his ex-Marine father over the latters unquestioning nationalism. Although its dubious how much of the political subtext the films target demographic will take away it adds another level to what would otherwise be a rote animal saga. Also noteworthy is Yakins gracious treatment of his star canine forgoing the meme-generating cute overload for a serious portrait of a lifesaving companion.Considering its myriad strengths though its a shame Max is treated to an exhaustive adventure sequence in its third act that quashes the delicate nuances Yakin nurtured throughout the film. Heavy ridiculous and interminable action rings false and feels incongruous to Maxs toned-down sensibilities ultimately forcing a pat ending for a film that could have served to further challenge its audience. Instead it falls back on whats expected of the genres revered canine heroes - and just in time for the Fourth of July.

What better time for a heartwarming caper movie about a troubled but noble Texas teen his troubled but noble dog and those crazy mean gun smugglers they tangle with?Yes we said crazy mean gun smugglers. Mexican cartels too. If that doesnt sound like normal PG-rated fare to you well youre right theres nothing too normal about ""Max."" Billed as a family adventure this movie is probably best described as a mix of ""Lassie"" and ""No Country for Old Men."" Its like they invited the Coen brothers -- or maybe Quentin Tarantino -- to script a few scenes of a ""Dora the Explorer"" episode.We could go on with the analogies but lets just say that there are still some people wholl appreciate ""Max"" directed and co-written by Boaz Yakin because they love dogs and thus any film about a good dog is a worthwhile endeavor. And the dog IS good. But beware This is No Movie for Little Kids.We begin in Afghanistan where Max (a Belgian Malinois actually played by four pooches) is a highly trained military dog performing risky searches alongside his devoted handler U.S. Marine Kyle Wincott. We see Max singlehandedly locate a Taliban weapons cache in a secret compartment in a home. But then tragedy strikes and Kyle is killed.Back in Texas the Wincott family -- Mom Pamela (Lauren Graham totally underused) Dad Ray (Thomas Haden Church) and teenager Justin (Josh Wiggins) -- are grieving at the funeral when they meet Max who heartbreakingly knows his boss is in the coffin. Max understandably is suffering from trauma and is hard to handle. He only seems calm around Justin; he senses the boy is Kyles brother. The family brings the dog home.At first Justin sensitively portrayed by the sweet-faced soulful Wiggins wants no part of training a dog. Hes obsessed with video games and resentful of his father who he feels has always favored hero Kyle. Hed rather stay in his room than manage a growling canine. But the movie dispenses with all that pretty quickly. Soon Justin and Max are fast friends nursing each other through tough times. Spicing things up a bit is a love interest for Justin the plucky Carmen (Mia Xitlali) cousin of Justins buddy Chuy (Dejon LaQuake) a typical movie best bud whose every line is like yo more cliched than the next.And then things get really strange.Trouble comes in the form of Tyler Harne (Luke Kleintank) Kyles childhood buddy and fellow Marine back from Afghanistan. We already knew that Tyler was up to some nefarious activity in the war zone involving disappearing guns but we learn the true nature of his troublesome dealings when hes back home and hitting up Ray for a job. As in many kid movies the kid understands whats going on a lot quicker than the parents. Ray thinks Tylers a good guy. Justin knows otherwise.Soon Justin Max Carmen and Chuy are off on a mystery-solving adventure in the woods -- just three kids a couple bikes and a dog. Its just that a bunch of guys with serious firepower are after them -- and as the Wicked Witch of the West would say their little dog too (actually hes not so little but still.) Its indeed heartwarming to watch Maxs heroics and Wiggins is appealing. Still as youre saying ""Aw"" and even tearing up a few times -- a heroic military dog? How could you not? -- you may also be saying something else out loud too as this plot goes haywire""Really? What were they thinking?""MaxGRADE D-Rated PG for action violence peril brief language and some thematic elementsRunning time 111 minutes 5 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECopyright 2015 The Associated Press.

One such example is the director Boaz Yakin who following a pair of personal indies (1994s Fresh and 1998s A Price Above Rubies both based on his own original screenplays) has turned into a kind of low-key journeyman. Since 2000 his work has run the gamut Theres been an uplifting star-driven football drama (Remember the Titans) a female-led comedy (Uptown Girls) a little-seen Night Porter-influenced psychosexual odyssey (Death in Love) and a New York City-set Jason Statham vehicle (Safe). Yakins new movie Max adds yet another genre to the fold -- its a canine sort-of-weepie with war-movie coating -- and Yakin executes the touching material with the expected serviceability.Max begins in Kandahar Province with golden boy Kyle Wincott (Robbie Amell) spearheading a unit alongside his MWD (Military Working Dog) partner a Belgian malinois named Max. With his nose to the ground and his tongue hanging out of his mouth Max leads the troops through small villages peering into windows and alleyways for hints of dangerous objects. Inside one residence Max pauses over a specific region of the floor; Kyle investigates and uncovers a deep pit stocked with firearms. But after reporting the finding to his superiors Kyle learns that some of the weapons from the pit are missing and he suspects that Tyler (Luke Kleintank) his wild-card best friend may have pocketed them for his own eventual financial benefit.Film Details Max RatingPG GenreAction/Adventure Running Time111 min. More Info Trailer Things turn worse during the units next mission when a miscommunication with Tyler results in Kyles death. Back home in Lufkin Texas Kyles family -- father Ray (Thomas Haden Church) mother Pamela (Lauren Graham) and little brother Justin (Hellions Josh Wiggins) -- is informed of the tragedy. On top of this with Max suffering from hazardous PTSD in Kyles absence the Wincotts are faced with a choice take Max into their home or consent to his being put down. With Max showing signs of responsiveness in the company of Justin the parents agree to care for him -- with the caveat that Justin heretofore a shut-in closed-off introvert with a video-game-heavy summer regimen take primary responsibility for conditioning the dog.Maxs presence initially proves a reprieve from grief and familial hostility. Ray himself a wounded military veteran who runs his own storage business (the uniforms are bland and the fridge is stocked with Coors) is pleased to see his youngest son apply himself in the task of taming Max. Justin for his part is helped in no small measure by animal-friendly Carmen (Mia Xitlali) the assertive cousin of Justins closest pal (Dejon LaQuake). (Carmen has a neck tattoo and wears My Chemical Romance T-shirts -- needless to say Justin is smitten.) But when Tyler comes knocking to pay his respects Maxs instant hostility prompts Justin to look deeper into the cause of his brothers death.Most of Max edited with predictable efficiency by Bill Pankow (a Brian De Palma collaborator dating back to 1984s Body Double) consists of no-surprises narrative delivery. However the unsavory character of Tyler -- who has brought those stolen weapons home with him from Afghanistan -- brings out the most in Yakins visual imagination. In one stunning totally unexpected shot as Ray soberly questions Tyler about the circumstances of his sons death Yakin shoots the conversation through a large whirring fan. Later as Tyler has a sinister heart-to-heart with Justin (""Im a realist. I know which way the world turns"" he says) Yakin uses a similarly suspenseful ploy with the desk lamps in Justins bedroom. Were touches like this more consistent Max might have transcended its generic template; as it stands its another modest functional success from a director who used to work on the margins.Max Directed by Boaz Yakin Warner Bros.

Print Email Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on June 26 2015 at 802 AM updated July 27 2015 at 538 PM comments OK a straight-up confession Although I pride myself on my critical acumen crystalline logic and reluctance to give into unexamined emotions when it comes to dogs I am suddenly... Oh whos a good boy? Yes you are. Yes you are So an advisory if thats not you subtract half-a-star from my review of ""Max"" right now. If you are also resistant to squeaky-clean family movies take off another half-a-star. But for those of us who arent sad jaded cold-hearted villains - kidding - ""Max"" deserves a reward. Its about a dog - a Belgian Malinois to be precise - whos survived the death of its human handler in Afghanistan. The animal itself has PTSD and is scheduled to be euthanized until the parents and kid brother of the dead Marine agree to take him in. At first the films conflicts are predictable - the kid isnt sure he wants the responsibility the dad is opposed and the dog howls a lot. But then just when weve gotten past that comes the Hardy Boys/Scooby-Doo twist - Oh no bad guys in town are smuggling guns Smugglers. Sheesh. Why is it always smugglers? OK go ahead and smirk. Im sure plenty will. The film is full of tired plot devices (and an old-fashioned faith-flag-and-family message) works awfully hard to hold onto its PG rating and yes I know doesnt offer a nuanced examination of foreign policy. Are we done? Because director Boaz Yakin directs the action sequences very well (some of them full of dogs-eye-view shots) and the cast is charming including Thomas Haden Church as the angry dad Lauren Graham as the understanding mom and Josh Wiggins (who looks disconcertingly like Hilary Swank) as our adolescent hero. True the writing isnt always deft. And theres at least one plot point - when Mia Xitali Wiggins kinda-girlfriend is sent off to get the police even though one of our heroes has a cell phone - which is stupid at best if not clearly sexist.But still you know -- the dog. His name is Carlos and hes terrific. He scales high fences he leaps over treacherous obstacles he runs like a rocket. Hes as handsome as Rin Tin Tin and as smart as Lassie as brave as any soldier and as empathetic as any therapist. And although the movie surrounding him is as corny and cheesy as junk food still -- dont you sometimes want Cheetos? Well ""Max"" is like a big bowl of them with a dog to share them with. Whos such a good boy. Such a good boy. Ratings note The film contains some human violence and a couple of scary dogfights. Max (PG) Warner Bros. (111 min.) Directed by Boaz Yakin.

"Review Are there Oscars for dogs? Carlos is the evocative star of Max - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Are there Oscars for dogs? Carlos is the evocative star of Max Max Warner Bros. Josh Wiggins in ""Max."" Josh Wiggins in ""Max."" (Warner Bros.) Katie Walsh Co-writer and director Boaz Yakins ""Max"" pulls the Lassie story out of the 1950s and plants it squarely in post-9/11 America.Marine Kyle Wincott (Robbie Amell) is a specialist working in the Middle East with Max a German shepherd sniffing out weapons caches and other threats. When Kyle dies attempting to rescue Max in a firefight the dog is so badly traumatized that he is unable to be handled by anyone -- except Kyles teenage brother brooding gamer Justin (Josh Wiggins). As the two bond Justin discovers that Kyles Marine buddy Tyler (Luke Kleintank) is lying about Maxs role in Kyles death to cover up his own cowardice and Tyler has gotten himself into shady illegal arms deals.It might seem as though ""Max"" got its premise from heartstring-tugging YouTube videos of dogs at Army funerals but the film is better than one might assume. A restrained performance from Wiggins keeps it from dipping too far into sentimentality tempering the Rockwell-esque caricatures of his parents played by Thomas Haden Church and Lauren Graham. Grahams sharp wit is wasted on a role that is essentially maternal wallpaper. The performance of Carlos as Max however is worthy of mention as the dog compellingly conveys different emotions. There are legitimately nail-biting action sequences and dog-on-dog combat fight scenes.

As co-written and directed by New Yorker Boaz Yakin (Now You See Me) Max is a movie that mythologizes an heroic American ""war dog"" while making the humans around him look like simpering and (in some cases) sleazy idiots. The premise is simple and often simple-minded Max the war dog returns from a tragic tour of duty Iraq where his handler (Robbie Amell) is killed in action; suffering from battle trauma our canine hero bonds with the dead soldiers surly younger brother (Josh Wiggins); chaos betrayal and hijinks ensue followed by transformation and redemption for the dog and the teenage boy. Yakins tear-jerking movie also spends a lot of screen time waving the stars-and-stripes indulging in an insufferable amount of U.S. military propaganda and shovelling in enough sentimental bullroar to choke a horse. A lot of that crap is handled by Thomas Haden Church who plays the proud papa of the dead soldier and the equally frustrated dad of the surviving boy. Lauren Graham plays the mom Churchs long-suffering wife. Her husband is a war-mongering bully. Meanwhile Wiggins hangs out with his own posse especially best friend Chuy (Dejon LaQuake) and Chuys cousin (Mia Xitlali). She becomes Wiggins object of affection while mentoring him in the handling of difficult dogs. In addition to the family and friends circle there is a requisite villain (Luke Kleintank) who served with Amell in the U.S. Marines and is now doing dirty deeds back home at Churchs expense. Mobile users please view here. None of the stories involving the humans is the least bit involving interesting or even well-acted. The characters are all shallow. Everything they do is painfully predictable. The tedium is unbearable Yakin used to make better movies than this paint-by-numbers job such as A Price Above Rubies (1998) and Remembers the Titans (2000). But he does have that dog in this movie. Maxs breed is fascinating. The Malinois or Belgian shepherd dog is a handsome and intelligent black-faced energetic working dog that is already famous in America as the guard dogs used around the White House. In war zones it is trained to detect danger and/or armaments making them extremely useful in saving human lives in places such as Iraq. The movie is dedicated to the history of war dogs of several breeds with photos dating back more than 100 years documenting their extraordinary service record. Bluntly speaking Max the movie would have been far more interesting if it was entirely about a K-9 unit in a theatre of war. Going home after a few scenes and making Max deal with civilian life reduces this movie to mindless mediocrity.

(You might sulk too if your big brother was a virtuous hunk who became a Marine just like war-hero Dad leaving you with little choice but to rebel in sullen stupid ways.) Its hard to criticize because for starters its about a dog with PTSD. Maybe the critic should kick some puppies as a warm-up or at least grind some flowers underfoot? Plus storywise its a solid attempt at a Boys Adventure movie -- slightly fantastical but with one sneaker still on the ground -- and that genre could use some modern updates besides the marvelous Mud. Plus it does some things really well particularly in the departments of atrophied virtue familial repair and yes moral complication. But for every good thing there is something else thats just plain bad -- distractingly so. Pacing. Delivery of dialogue (hard to tell whether to blame actors or director here). Audience-baiting sass. Surely sincerity doesnt have to feel this amateurish. 2015. -- Matthew Lickona This movie is not currently in theaters.

"Max | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; max ) Max (United States 2015) June 25 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli The live-action family film once a cinema staple has been made all-but-extinct by a surge in the availability of animated fare. Max is a throwback of sorts - a movie about the relationship between a boy and his dog. Lassie springs to mind as the genre classic but this has a closer kinship to Rin Tin Tin. Although its sensibilities are old-fashioned the movie offers a modern look and feel. It counterbalances sentimentality with a dose of cynicism and although the films second half is considerably weaker than the first hour it offers better entertainment than several big budget films clogging multiplex auditoriums. Maxs setup takes us to Kandahar where Marine Kyle Wincott (Robbie Amell) and his dog Max are searching for insurgents illegal weapons and explosives. Following one successful mission Kyle skypes home and has a pleasant chat with his mom Pamela (Lauren Graham) and dad Ray (Thomas Haden Church). His teenage brother Justin (Josh Wiggins) cant be bothered to stop playing video games long enough to converse with Kyle. Justin isnt just a game addict; he makes some cash by pirating software and selling copies to a local gang leader. Its an ordinary June afternoon when the Wincotts get the visit dreaded by every military family. Kyle has been killed and Max suffering from extreme PTSD is scheduled to be put down. In an act of mercy the Wincotts agree to care for the dog after Max shows an unmistakable affinity for Justin. Thus begins a story of mutual healing. As Max learns to again become comfortable around people Justin gains a new appreciation of responsibility and friendship. All that is threatened however with the arrival of Kyles friend and ex-Marine compatriot Tyler (Luke Kleintank) who hides a dark secret. Although little about Max is exceptional the film is adept at developing the relationship between Justin and Max and showing how the boys character shifts from extreme self-absorption to putting the needs of others before his own. The movie is strongest when it focuses on the bonding between teenager and dog and how Maxs intrusion into the Wincotts life changes the family dynamic. There are elements of subtlety here that might be lost on a younger viewer. The second half offers standard family adventure movie material with Max and Justin teaming up to foil a nefarious plan. This section isnt badly written but its straightforward and predictable. Everything happens the way the viewer expects although there is a surprisingly dense conversation between Justin and Tyler that questions the culpability of the government in criminal activities within the military. Its a bold and unexpected statement in an otherwise lightweight piece of entertainment. Although none of the actors in Max are going to win Oscars for their efforts here the leads are solid. Thomas Hayden Church brings a mix of gruffness competence and (repressed) affection to the role of an ex-Marine who has trouble relating to his surviving son. Josh Wiggins is effective getting us to dislike Justin at the beginning before gradually warming to him as his character loses his self-centeredness. Lauren Graham is wasted in the cliched part of the supportive mother. Of course the big star is the dog  a well-trained Belgian Malinois whose actions and obedience seem unfeigned. The co-writer and director is Boaz Yakin who debuted with the highly successful 1994 indie film Fresh and went on to make Remember the Titans. Yakin hasnt done much in recent years and while Max wont put him near the top of the box office heap it is a reminder that an ""old fashioned"" movie can be affecting and effective when the filmmaker understands the value of understatement. Warner Brothers has modest expectations for the films success and its being released into a crowded field.

Photo Credit Kent Smith/Warner Bros. Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A wayward teen adopts the military dog that belonged to his brother a fallen soldier. Rated PG (action violence and brief language). BOTTOM LINE A post-9/11 ""Benji"" enlivened by a solid cast and slightly edgy action. CAST Josh Wiggins Thomas Haden Church Lauren Graham Robbie Amell. A wholesome family-film with just a hint of edginess ""Max"" is named for its hero a U.S. military dog who served in Afghanistan. It may or may not be coincidence that Maxs handler was a Marine named Kyle (Robbie Amell of ""The DUFF"") which brings to mind Chris Kyle the battle-hardened Navy SEAL of ""American Sniper."" In this movie however its Max who returns home with post-traumatic stress syndrome after his master is killed. Initially ""Max"" seems like a calculated bid to capture a certain kind of Middle American audience. Its set in a small Texas town where Kyles younger brother Justin Wincott (Josh Wiggins) is heading down the wrong path. He scoffs at his God-fearing mother (Lauren Graham) and his ex-Marine father (Thomas Haden Church). Hes also dealing on the side -- not drugs but pirated video games. When Max is given to the Wincott family the troubled dog and the wayward boy may be just what the other needs. advertisement | advertise on newsday ""Max"" can be corny but writer-director Boaz Yakin makes it mostly work. For starters the core cast is quite good. Wiggins a young newcomer (""Max"" is his third feature) plays Justin with the right balance of snark and sensitivity; Church himself a former Texas-raised Marine is unimpeachable; and Graham never overdoes the waterworks. Max is capably played by several Belgian malinois. StoryMax goes to the dogs in a really good way ""Max"" is essentially a post-9/11 ""Benji"" driven by a fairly hokey plot in which Justin discovers that a corrupt Marine (Luke Kleintank ""Gossip Girl"") is selling firearms stolen from Afghanistan. Along for the ride are Justins love interest Carmen (Mia Xitlali) and his friend Chuy (Dejon LaQuake). Yakin livens up even this material by giving some extra urgency to the chase scenes. ""Max"" deserves credit for indulging in sentiment without laying it on too thick. Though we know the movie will end with hugs and reconciliations Justins anger doesnt dissipate easily. Any kid who openly sasses the war in small-town Texas has got to be a tough case.

"Max is no War Horse review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesMax is no War Horse reviewMax a family drama about a traumatized military dog who returns home from Afghanistan to face challenges in civilian life opens Friday.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. June 25 2015MaxStarring Josh Wiggins Thomas Haden Church Lauren Graham Mia Xitlali Luke Kleintank and Robbie Amell. Directed by Boaz Yakin. 111 minutes. Opening Friday at major theatres. PGAmerica loves its movie war heroes four-footed ones included.Enter Max a family drama about a traumatized military dog who returns stateside to face challenges in civilian life leaning heavily on stars-and-stripes schmaltz before settling into an uninspired boy-and-his-dog adventure.Article Continued BelowDogged by plot holes and one-dimensional characters there will doubtless be audiences that will lap up Max anyway.Max comes home from the war a changed canine in this drama.Like American Snipers Navy SEAL Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) who returned from Iraq with a host of emotional problems Max comes home with a grieving heart and a bad case of post-traumatic stress.First seen clad in a protective vest handsome Belgian Malinois Max is a paws-on-the ground arms-sniffing member of a Marine unit in Afghanistan working with handler and best friend Kyle Wincott (Torontos Robbie Amell of The Duff).Back home in Texas Kyles mom (Lauren Graham of TVs Parenthood) and Iraq War ""he-ro"" dad (a scowling Thomas Haden Church of Sideways) are proud of their son and his canine support. Not so younger brother Justin (Hellions Josh Wiggins) who clutches his video game controller and makes cynical asides.When Kyle is killed in action Max ends up back in the Wincotts hometown. Cue the waterworks at Kyles funeral as the whimpering pooch lunges for his buddys flag-draped casket. Its the only authentic heartstrings moment in Max which misses multiple chances to be a more genuinely rendered drama.Made unpredictable by trauma the dog cant work with a new handler and Maxs failings seem to have him headed for the kennel in the sky. Since this is Texas that may not include a trip to the vet.Yet Max seems to calm around Justin instantly bonding with the teen who rebuffs him until his best friend Chuys (Dejon LaQuake) pretty dog-whisperer cousin Carmen (Mia Xitlali) shows up. Max is no Warhorse. And director Boaz Yakin isnt able to replicate the huge heart of a previous film he helmed Denzel Washington starrer Remember the Titans.Theres a decent chase scene involving Max bikes and charging slobbering Rottweilers but kids may find the ensuing dogfight scenes unsettling. Worse the silly story involving an ex-Marine from Kyles unit (Luke Kleintank) and a cartel of Mexican gun dealers is ridiculous. However the dogs that play Max are completely engaging free of the howlingly bad dialogue from Boaz and ex-Marine Sheldon Lettich (Rambo III).If only Max had played fetch with a better and less manipulative story.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Daily Edition Login to download Max Film Review 1000 AM PDT 6/25/2015 by Sheri Linden FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS Anyone expecting complex stirring drama is barking up the wrong tree. TWITTER After his Marine partner is killed in action a military working dog is adopted by the soldieras Texas family. The handsome Belgian Malinois who plays the title character in Max (with the help of a few trusty stunt doubles) is an action star par excellence. Hes also the only involving character in this blunt instrument of a family drama. The canine trouper fares best not just because of that expressive face and athletic body but because hes spared the embarrassment of speaking the hokey dialogue. Emotional nuance never has been the forte of director Boaz Yakin (Remember the Titans) or his co-scripter Sheldon Lettich (Rambo III) but here even the broad-stroke storytelling falls short of its intended impact -- not helped by the desperate bombast of Trevor Rabins score. The tale of a war-traumatized military working dog or MWD who helps a teen boy and his family overcome their own war-related grief Max puts a YA slant on an intriguing setup. But the screenplay muddles its emotional core with a clunky cross between old-fashioned Hardy Boys mystery and a far-fetched weapons-trafficking subplot. Families who have already seen Inside Out might be enticed along with moviegoers who are eager to root for a heroic hound and are not put off by the military angle. Though the movies good guys and bad guys couldnt be more clearly drawn that military angle is far from flag-wavingly simplistic (though not exactly complex) with Yakin and Lettich foregrounding PTSD and other devastating effects of frontline battle. Maxs post-traumatic stress makes him unable to work with anyone else after his Marine handler Kyle Wincott (Robbie Amell) is killed in Afghanistan. The sight of Max running to Kyles coffin is wrenching. Read more Summer Movie Guide Sequels... Comedy... Action Soon after the funeral the Wincotts are alerted that Max will be put down so they decide to adopt him. The decision is spearheaded by mom Pamela (Lauren Graham lending leavening warmth) who declares in one of the films more effective lines that ""this family takes care of its own."" Dad Ray an injured Iraq vet played with overdone rigidity by Thomas Haden Church comes to blame the dog for his sons death upping the friction between him and his younger son Justin (Josh Wiggins of Hellion) who becomes Maxs caretaker. With training tips from tough-talking tomboy Carmen (Mia Xitlali) that are drawn straight from the Cesar Millan playbook Justin puts aside his video-game bootlegging enterprise and learns to handle Max and understand him. He discovers too that the dog growls around Kyles friend and fellow Marine Tyler (Luke Kleintank) for a reason. Having telegraphed Tylers bad-apple status from the get-go Yakin draws a widening circle of hard-to-buy connections involving the discharged Marine local gang leader Emilio (Joseph Julian Soria) a crooked cop (Owen Harn) a Mexican cartel and farther afield the Taliban. The baddies naturally include a couple of Rottweilers and theres some impressive dog-on-dog action as Max assists de-facto detectives Justin Carmen and her cousin Chuy (Dejon LaQuake) -- without having to partake in their ""comic"" exchanges. Animal coordinator Mark Forbes has drawn commendable performances from the dogs and the stunt sequences both canine and human are staged effectively and are shot well by Stefan Czapsky. But they never really matter. And the teens hangout a DIY bike park in the woods thats a nice element of Kalina Ivanovs production design isnt quite enough to explain Justins daring two-wheeled maneuvers. Though the lead performance would do Lassie and Rin Tin Tin proud Maxs increasingly ludicrous cliche-packed plot generates not an ounce of suspense.

In these ""everything old is new again"" times Warner Bros. resuscitates the spirit of its very first screen legend with ""Max"" which updates the myth of the canine superhero to soothe present-day anxieties. Rin Tin Tin was a four-quadrant celeb but director Boaz Yakin (""Remember the Titans"") makes no pretense at entertaining adults. When we first see Max the Belgian Malinois (a breed closely related to the German Shepherd) back from his Afghan deployment clearly suffering from PTSD the film feints at an allegory about injured veterans. But Maxs military career (and war wounds) are really just a backdrop for a tale thats preposterous and predictable -- if also frequently pleasurable -- about a dog that repays the family that gave it a second chance with superhuman devotion and loyalty. Also Read The Dog Whisperers Cesar Millan Son Calvin to Star on Sid and Marty Kroffts Mutt amp; Stuff The one genuinely heartbreaking scene in ""Max"" comes early when the canine vet drags his handler down the middle of a church toward the altar a torrent of paws scrambling to get close to the dogs fallen trainer Kyle (Robbie Amell) for the last time. Now in mourning and terrified of loud noises the newly aggressive hound is slated to be put down until hes rescued by Kyles family who are themselves desperate to hold on to something of their deceased older son. Kyles resentful and spoiled younger brother Justin (Josh Wiggins rightly cast for his perma-smirk) is tasked with rehabilitating Max by his parents (Thomas Haden Church and Lauren Graham) so that the teen doesnt waste his own summer in front of the computer. Also Read From Wags to Riches 9 of TVs Most Famous Dogs (Photos) The story beats are as obvious as the dogs wagging tail. Justin learns how to take responsibility by teaching the anxious workaholic mutt to be a pet (a little too easily) with the help of Carmen (Mia Xitlali) the tough but flirty new girl in town. Justin and his dad share a meaningful conversation about how despite Kyles sacrifice the armed forces dont have a monopoly on heroism. The family eventually trusts Max caged in the backyard to let him in the house. Carmen spouts a few facts about Latinos so that the film can pat itself on the back for being multicultural even while stereotyping almost every other Mexican-American character as a gangster or a drug lord. None of these plot points are run through with any thoughtfulness or panache. Despite a great unaffected performance by Wiggins -- the only one among the cast -- and the primal joy of seeing the dog actors sprinting leaping and maybe even emoting the film is sunk because the characters never transcend their seeming origins in a Disney Channel movie project. Also Read The Flash Star Robbie Amell in Negotiations to Join Kevin Spacey in Nine Lives (Exclusive) Written by Yakin and Sheldon Lettich the script does offer one real surprise a subplot about arms trafficking that feels too dark even for a film like this one in which the protagonists older brother is killed (bloodlessly) in the first few minutes. Justin and Max square off against Kyles villainous squad-mate Tyler (Luke Kleintank) who somehow smuggles confiscated firearms from the Taliban and sells them to Mexican cartels in the Texas border region. Tylers smooth snakish tongue and obsessive hatred of Max eventually forces Justin to (ludicrously) choose between the dogs life or those of his parents leading to a final confrontation that feels disappointingly small and slapdash. ""Max"" takes us to Afghanistan and back but somehow we end up stuck as another heroic dog of yesteryear would have it down Timmys well.

Justins folks played by the unfortunately straight-faced Lauren Graham and Thomas Haden Church have their own issues with Justin particularly Dad who seems to have preferred his older offsprings heroic brio. But things get hairy once the late soldiers best pal (Luke Kleintank) turns up in town and subsequently makes Max mad. So you get a pretty standard-fare harmless boy-meets-animal bonding flick...for about 15 minutes. Beyond that the movie incredulously introduces villains (some of whom may as well be in Breaking Baddies) as vigorously as the cliches; in fact the movie is so unsubtle Justin even calls them ""bad guys"" outright. Discovering that one of the films writers hails from the labyrinthine thoughtful world of (ahem) Jean-Claude van Damme revenge pics you get a much clearer sense of where this features priorities lie and the movie is downright laughable when it isnt merely unpleasant. (In the credibility-stretching universe here the Marines () dole out classified info to teenagers...just because.) Here you will find no truly honest emotions just trumped-up movie ones--Trevor Rabins bleating overbearing score never lets you forget it--and the saddest part is how the filmmakers assume that the innate love for our furry friends will automatically distract from the fact that it is an unredeeming routine thriller. Theres just no delicate way to put it Max is a real dog.

Director Boaz Yakin (150). PG Violence. Area theaters. UNLEASH THE dogs of bore Dullness as well as hoary preachiness neuters the family-and-their-war-dog drama ""Max."" The titular four-legged soldier is a military working dog serving in the Middle East. Hes a Belgian Malinois trained since puphood to listen to orders. He goes into dangerous areas risking getting shot or blown up. Lauren Graham Tomas Haden Church in ""Max"" (Kent Smith) Maxs handler and best friend is Kyle (Robbie Amell) a Marine who is killed while on maneuvers in Afghanistans Kandahar Province. Max next to Kyle when the enemy attacked suffers from PTSD. Kyles family in Texas adopts Max rather than have him put down especially after Kyles sullen younger brother Justin (Josh Wiggins) forms an uneasy bond with Max. The boys diversion from video games and surliness is welcomed by his stolid mom (Lauren Graham). Robbie Amell and dog in ""Max"" (Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures) But wait -- theres more plot. Kyles childhood pal and fellow soldier Tyler (Luke Kleintank) is a shifty dude who starts working at a storage garage run by Justins dad (Thomas Haden Church). Tyler secretly uses the facilities to house illegal arms shipped from Afghanistan. Max sniffs trouble. So does Justin whose crush on Carmen (Mia Xitlali) is interrupted by his personal mission to stop Tyler and his gangster buds. Putting aside whether its decent to send dogs to precheck dangerous terrain ""Max"" is a clunky flag-waver that fails its major missions. Its not a successful tear-jerker about an angry dog rehabilitated. Its not a good kids flick since the level of violence -- off the battlefield -- is excessive. (In the desert that violence is serious but morally sure.) And the movies fatally distracted by its B-movie villains. Josh Wiggins and dog in ""Max"" (Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures) The dog himself is a Rin Tin Tin-type who has only two personality traits -- angry and loyal. He wont be joining the pantheon of famous movie hero pooches no matter how many gorges he jumps across or growly mastiffs he fends off. Graham simply frets and frowns and Haden Church dials down any charm to play a GOP dream demographic. Director-cowriter Boaz Yakin (""Remember the Titans"") would seem to be the guy capable of giving this story the Americana gloss it deserves. No such luck. Wiggins who gained attention in the indie ""Hellion"" resembles the young Leonardo DiCaprio and strives to make his character more interesting than written. Maybe next time Wiggins wont be in such a dog. jneumaiernydailynews.com Tags movies movie reviews robbie amell josh wiggins lauren graham Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Justin Wincott (Josh Wiggins) and his late Marine brothers dog both troubled souls bond in ""Max."" (Kent Smith/Warner Bros. Pictures) By Michael OSullivan June 25 2015 Its hard to fault a movie for being schmaltzy when its as unabashedly virtuosic in its efforts to pluck at your heartstrings as ""Max."" The drama about the bond between a troubled youngster and his troubled dog is as nakedly sentimental as these things come and they dont come along often these days not since the Rin Tin Tin and Lassie tales of yore. But ""Max"" also is polished utterly effective moviemaking. Of course it helps if youre a sucker for the sort of clickbait videos about loyal brave and true canines that seem to clutter up certain Facebook news feeds these days. (Guilty as charged.) It also doesnt hurt if youre younger than 10. Rated PG for some bloodless war footage and shooting ""Max"" is the kind of old-fashioned family-friendly fare that some nostalgic moviegoers complain they just dont make anymore. (To which critics respond Even when they do theyre garbage.) ""Max"" is not garbage. It may be hooey but its artisanal hooey. Directed by Boaz Yakin (""Remember the Titans"") from a script written with Sheldon Lettich (""Rambo III"") the movie is the story of small-town Texas teenager Justin Wincott (Josh Wiggins) and the dog he inherits when the animals previous companion Joshs Marine brother Kyle (Robbie Amell) is killed in Afghanistan. Max a Belgian Malinois trained as a military working dog is suffering from a kind of canine PTSD and is violently unmanageable except when hes with Justin. The boy as one might expect is a bit unmanageable himself. He has a contentious relationship with his father played by a nicely low-key Thomas Haden Church who sets his characters disappointment in his younger son on simmer and leaves it there until the movies inevitable reconciliation. The rest of the cast is uniformly good with Wiggins delivering an especially nuanced performance as a boy living in the shadow of his war-hero brother. Lauren Graham brings a warm groundedness to the story as Justins mother. And Dejon LaQuake as Justins best friend Chuy and Mia Xitlali as his (eventual) girlfriend Carmen bring a bit of bickering comic relief to the proceedings. Only Luke Kleintank as Kyles war buddy Tyler -- and the movies villain who is hiding something about how Kyle died along with one or two other nefarious secrets -- could use a tighter leash. Max growls and bares his teeth every time Tyler shows up. The dog isnt the only one who can smell the characters villainy a mile off. Despite the overplaying ""Max"" gets its job done which is to celebrate the sacrifices of military dogs while warming the cockles of your heart. Sugary though it may be the movie is a spirited return to the values of 1950s Hollywood. They say that you cant teach an old dog new tricks but sometimes the old tricks are enough. PG. At area theaters. Contains violence and brief mild vulgarity. 111 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Josh Wiggins plays the brother of a Marine killed in action who must learn to handle his combat dog. Photo Warner Bros. Max tugs at the heartstrings -- hard 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Theres a lot going on in the family movie ""Max"" which is partly a redemptive story about a troubled boy and his dog but also a crime thriller with action elements and a junior detective tale. The idea isnt to challenge the audience. This is a melodrama that aims to uphold traditional values and its effective in playing to the viewers emotions. Max is a combat dog who was traumatized when his handler a Marine was killed in action in Afghanistan. Almost uncontrollable Max winds up with the handlers small-town Texas family and is made the responsibility of the dead mans younger brother Justin (Josh Wiggins). Hes a surly youngster immersed in a world of video games and extreme bike riding and is particularly at odds with his father (Thomas Haden Church) a no-nonsense but sympathetic Marine. Slowly the boy begins to bond with Max who senses Justins connection to the handler. Justin also gets some dog training lessons from a new friend (Mia Xitlali) a brash Latina who is the cousin of one of the boys biking buddies (Dejon LaQuake). For reasons I wont trouble you with the dad becomes convinced that Max was somehow responsible for his elder sons death. Before that problem gets resolved Justin the girl and his best friend -- as well as the father -- are unwillingly dragged into a nasty criminal enterprise that could have deadly consequences. The villain (Luke Kleintank) is a rogue Marine who was the handlers boyhood chum and served with him in Afghanistan and now works for the dad. Max instantly recognizes this guy as a heel. Its plenty to keep track of but you might find it touching and inspiring if you can keep your cynicism in check. The sappy music and Hallmark look of ""Max"" dont help nor does the script which is straight out of Screenwriting 101. There are one or two clunky plot turns that evoked titters from a preview audience. The filmmaker is Boaz Yakin a director and screenwriter with a decidedly cloying streak. His best previous work is probably the Denzel Washington vehicle ""Remember the Titans."" (Yakin certainly wont be remembered for writing the disastrous ""Prince of Persia The Sands of Time."") ""Max"" seems to suit the directors talent for pushing emotional buttons. The handsome and appealing Max by the way is played by five dogs. For the record he is a Belgian Malinois a breed that in real life is often used in police and military work. Walter Addiego is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Its well-meaning but dull.Max is slow to warm up to humans after he returns from duty in Afghanistan but young Justin gets through to him.(Photo Warner Bros. Pictures)Story HighlightsCritics review 2.5 stars (out of 5)Theres little pleasure in criticizing a movie about what shouldnt be criticized. The Max of the title is a gorgeous intelligent Belgian Malinois one of 3000-plus dogs that served in Iraq and Afghanistan were told at the start. The film that follows is a love letter to the troops and their sacrifice; when Maxs soldier who had raised and trained him from puppyhood is killed on the front lines the dogs anguish is as moving as that of any human.""Max"" knows you want to love it want to root for good people doing good things in the service of family and country with their doggy sidekick. And because ""Max"" knows that it also knows it doesnt have to try. Its the Walmart of feel-good family films accessible cheaply made useful in a pinch and full of American flags.After losing their eldest son in the war the Wincott family is devastated to learn that his shell-shocked soldier dog has been abandoned in a shelter as a lost cause. The Wincotts adopt the dog because ""family takes care of its own"" -- and because theyre reluctant to lose a living link to their dead son.Ray (Thomas Haden Church) is taking his sons loss particularly hard and he takes that pain out on his youngest son Justin (Josh Wiggins) a mildly troubled teen with an attitude problem -- justifiably as he lives in the shadow of his dead hero brother and in the contempt of a father who misses his favorite son.The responsibility of caring for Max and luring the four-legged vet out of his PTSD falls on Justin. Despite initially rebuffing the chore Justin quickly forms a bond of trust with Max. Enough so that when the dog takes a quick disliking to Luke (Tyler Harne) a soldier buddy of Justins dead brother who was there when tragedy struck Justin investigates.Does the dog know something nobody else knows? Of course he does.AZCENTRALMax (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsAt no point does ""Max"" deviate from the boilerplate script of family-friendly flag-waving espousing the laziest possible heartland views of patriotism Texas guns country music flag worship and T-shirts that read "" Murica."" Theres nothing wrong with those things (save for the "" Murica"" shirt because thats just wrong). But when those details are bundled together with overly familiar plot points cartoon villains halfhearted camera work an overbearing score and an insulting lack of attention to detail (like a cellphone that works just fine after being plunged into a river because its convenient to the plot) it paints a portrait of a creative team that tried just hard enough and no harder.Which all told is a pretty lousy salute to those who sacrificed their all.Reach the reporter at barbara.vandenburgharizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8371.

"Max Review Marine Dog and His Boy | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review Max Geoff Berkshire Associate Editor Features geoffberkshire 10 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr Warner Bros / MGM June 25 2015 | 1000AM PT Marine dog returns from Afghanistan finds himself in a second-rate action thriller. As far as canine hero stories go ""Max"" is a strangely mixed breed. A hodgepodge of corny coming-of-ager inspirational boy-and-his-pup pablum modern-day military tale and surprisingly violent PG-rated action thriller its an all-around odd choice to release up against the big dogs of summer. Even if Warner Bros. hopes some of that ""American Sniper"" B.O. magic rubs off on a film ostensibly about a pooch overcoming PTSD (""American Sniffer""?) woe be to the family-targeted movie competing with the likes of ""Inside Out"" and ""Jurassic World."" Expect a bigger bite in ancillary. Given the appeal of the Belgian Malinois (or technically six Belgian Malinois) playing the titular character its almost a shame the film has to rely on generic bipeds to drive the action. That begins with Texan teen Justin Wincott (Josh Wiggins) who becomes Maxs de facto master after his older brother Kyle (Robbie Amell) is killed on an Afghanistan battlefield. Kyle had been Maxs Marine Corps handler since puppyhood and there was no one the fallen soldier trusted more. That makes Max especially significant to Justin and Kyles parents Ray (Thomas Haden Church) and Pamela (Lauren Graham) who hope that family rebel Justin can develop some of his big bros nobility and responsibility by learning to care for his dog. (Justin bootlegs videogames which might be a new form of Hollywood shorthand for kids headed down the wrong path.) But the incident that claimed Kyles life also left Max emotionally scarred. Enter lovely young dog whisperer Carmen (Mia Xitlali) who happens to be the cousin of Justins best friend Chuy (Dejon LaQuake). Her mixture of animal knowledge bike skills and sassy attitude have Justin falling head over heels and in the process teaching Max some new tricks for life on the homefront. For close to an hour ""Max"" unfolds as a relatively low-key drama about a kid flirting with bad influences and bonding with a battle-weary animal -- until a left-field subplot involving Kyles bad-news military buddy Tyler (Luke Kleintank) possesses the film like the ghost of a 90s straight-to-video actioner. Tyler resurfaces to sell illegal arms to a Mexican gang with the help of Chuys thuggish cousin Emilio (Joseph Julian Soria) and a corrupt local cop (Owen Harn). When Justin and Max discover whats going on the first of several unexpectedly adrenalized action scenes finds Max duking it out with two vicious Rottweilers. (The conflict is so ferocious that more sensitive viewers will be sure to stick around during the end credits to confirm animal action was monitored by the American Humane Assn. It was.) Perhaps the key to these weird plot mechanics lies with co-writer Sheldon Lettich a former Marine himself and a veteran scribe and occasional helmer of multiple Jean-Claude Van Damme vehicles (including ""Bloodsport"" and ""Double Impact""). His resume ultimately seems more indicative of what auds should expect -- clunky dialogue cardboard characters and random action set pieces -- than the involvement of director and co-writer Boaz Yakin whose more inscrutable filmography ranges from ""Remember the Titans"" to ""Uptown Girls"" to the unsettling sexual-dysfunction indie ""Death in Love."" In any case ""Max"" isnt going to be a career high for any of its human participants but the six canines playing Max -- Carlos in closeups and Jagger Pax Dude Pilot and Chaos in various action modes -- arent likely to find a better cinematic showcase any time soon. From a daring doggie jailbreak to multiple instances of third-act heroism these four-legged stars should prove wildly popular with whatever auds the pic can garner. Its too bad the film doesnt provide a better sense of what makes the Belgian Malinois so uniquely suited to the battlefield or find a way to pay more than lip service to the deep bonds developed between military men and animals. By dispensing with Kyle in the first reel and centering the story on Justin the pic automatically becomes more conventional and less interesting long before that unnecessary swerve into action formula. Tech credits are generally fine -- and d.p. Stefan Czapsky captures one truly striking image of Justin and Max sitting together in Maxs outdoor cage watching Fourth of July fireworks -- but again the real standout goes to the dogs. Animal coordinator Mark Forbes deserves a 21-paw salute for wrangling not only six Belgian Malinois and five Rottweilers who rotate in and out of three different roles but also the six Chihuahuas playing Carmens rescue dogs who show up onscreen simultaneously.

Eleanor says March 20 2016 at 558 pm Gotta tell you I loved this movie. Nothing wrong with a family movie even if a bit corny. The Hollywood big shots who think themselves so intelligent by making over produced nonsensical films I wouldnt spend the 90 cents it once cost to go to a movie to see havent a clue. I guess you do have to be a lover of dogs and I am so perhaps that is what helps me to like this film. However a good old fashioned type story with a happy ending is why most people watch movies. We like to be entertained. When I desire real life I can live my own life or look at the lives of others or listen to our crooked politicians and the idiot celebrities who think they have something relevant to say. No this story is not true but it is dedicated to the marines and their dogs who have died in service of our country under horrific conditions. That makes the film good enough for me and one I would recommend. It is presently being shown on HBO and til it came on that channel I didnt even know the movie existed. Reply Robert Gobar says August 22 2015 at 1159 am It would have been very cool to get this paired with ""American Sniper"". Reply Terry says July 8 2015 at 1005 am I saw this movie yesterday and loved every minute It was both sad and exciting My only downside was what I considered to be the boys father who seemed to act more like a step-father than a biological one. I wonder how the dog fights were filmed which I suppose was the concern of the animal ""rights"" contingency. Reply yu says July 1 2015 at 447 pm What? Variety is surprised there is no limit as to how low Hollywood will stoop to make a buck. They have become devoid of any new ideas stories concepts and are haphazardly re-hashing old themes. Although here they failed to use the latest fad CGI to try to make a pile of old poo look fresh. Ahmmm Ahmmm Im looking in your direction Terminator Jurassic Park Mad Max Insidious.....and every time travel movie since Wells 1960 moive The Time Machine. Reply Laura says June 26 2015 at 305 pm Heres hoping this movie at least helps raise awareness of the fact that military dogs really can and do suffer from PTSD just like two-legged war veterans. Reply stevenkovacs says June 26 2015 at 208 pm Ill take Max over Mad Max anyday  Reply Karen North says June 26 2015 at 657 am ""Max"" will be the box office surprise because there has not been a great dog film of since 2006 ""Eight Below"" and 2007 ""Firehouse Dog"". There is a reason why every tv commercial seems to include a dog. Interesting to see if Maxs PTS is as bad as it was for the collie named Bill in 1946 ""Courage of Lassie"". no alien robots either Reply mace says June 25 2015 at 717 pm I just seen this movie and i disagree with the writer of this article. It was a very good movie. I enjoyed it. I give this movie five stars. Reply I Love Dogs says June 25 2015 at 1205 pm ""American Sniffer"" -- funny. Thanks Reply Jason Rodriguez (jrodfilms) says June 25 2015 at 1053 am movie looks cute but corny. id rather see max than ted 2 or terminator 5.

Pictures via AP) Hes got four paws for patriotism and a nose for trouble. In the killing fields of Kandahar they call him ... American Sniffer.If Clint Eastwood had directed a war-dog story like ""Max"" it might have been a bloody chew toy for a victory-starved public. But writer and director Boaz Yakin (""Rember the Titans"") is more interested in pulling heartstrings than waving flags. ""Max"" is an old-style adventure movie for kids with a bike-riding boy as Roy Rogers and a Belgian Shepherd as his canine companion.The boy is Justin Wincott (Josh Wiggins) a mid-teen who lives in East Texas with his doting mother Pam (Lauren Graham) and gruff battle-scarred father Ray (Thomas Haden Church). Older son Kyle (Robbie Amell) followed his dad into the Marines but a mishap in Afghanistan abruptly ends Kyles career and traumatizes his beloved dog Max whos been trained to sniff out explosives. When Max is shipped to Kyles family in Texas Ray orders Justin to pacify the barking beast or it will be euthanized. Justin would rather spend his summer playing the latest video games which he bootlegs for his best friend Chuy (Dejon Lequake). But at the local bike ramp Justin discovers that Chuy has a cute cousin named Carmen (Mia Xitlali) who knows how to train dogs.Via Carmen and Marine dog trainer Sgt. Reyes (Jay Hernandez) ""Max"" provides a thumbnail guide to obedience training and there are plenty of coo-inducing shots of the expressive pooch placing his snout within petting distance of Justin. But when the movie morphs from a story of mutual healing into a crime-fighting caper it goes off track. Max sniffs out that Chuys buyer for the bootlegged video games is also brokering an arms deal between a Mexican cartel and a disgruntled ex-Marine. With the help of his four-legged friend (and his one-legged dad) Justin finds his inner hero. In its last act ""Max"" is reminiscent of Rin Tin Tin and Lassie serials with a frosting of freshly minted multiculturalism. Theres nothing too scary or realistic in this PG-rated film -- the teenage kids even wear helmets as they bike through the woods -- but theres nothing too memorable either. Yet as a bite-size lesson in loyalty and courage its a nice alternative to the too-many movies about a dog-eat-dog world.What ""Max""  21/2 stars out of four  Run time 151  Rating PG  Content Action violence peril brief language and some thematic elements War-dog movie Max reminds us that canine lives matter Movies director and star visit St. Louis Tags Max Joe Williams Lauren Graham Thomas Haden Church Josh Wiggins Joe Williams Joe Williams is the film critic for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

Share Tweet The kid-friendly bizarre Taliban weapons are being smuggled through small-town America by Mexican drug cartels and its up to a Belgian Malinois dog and three BMX-riding teens to stop them. Like some toxic-sludge mutant grown in the racks of a mom-and-pop video store Max crosses alarmist plotting with canine hijinks and hamfisted family drama that would feel at home in the era of the white clamshell VHS case. It is dull and weird--weird in that way that it is pronounced we-ee-eird the stretched vowel signaling a weirdness that is probably unconscious on the part of the filmmakers. What to make of the character of the Afghan War veteran (Luke Klientank) who inserts himself into the life of a grieving family under false pretenses a la The Guest? Or the prosthetic leg that is continually alluded to but never shown? This is after all a movie whose star is a dog and which ends with a drawled country cover of ""Forever Young"" accompanied by a slideshow of dogs in military regalia.Here a Marine Corps dog is adopted by the family of its handler who was killed in Afghanistan. Mustachioed dad Ray (Thomas Haden Church) is a veteran of the first Gulf War and runs a storage locker facility. Youngest son Justin (Josh Wiggins) spends his time burning CDs and hanging around with Chuy (Dejon LaQuake) the kind of movie best friend who begins every sentence with ""yo"" as though it were a speech impediment. Mom Pam (Lauren Graham) doesnt do much except cook and cry. This is the American nuclear family as imagined by Boaz Yakin (Fresh Safe) a director who specializes in awkward mixtures of sentimentality and genre and co-writer Sheldon Lettich best known for his work with Jean-Claude Van Damme. It is under threat from within and without by bogeymen video games software piracy gun traffickers small-town criminals who spend an inordinate amount of time threatening high-school freshman-age kids. Perhaps this story of a boy trying to live up to the example set by his valorized older brother would be more affecting if it didnt end with a truss bridge being blown apart by a rocket launcher.Max has no shortage of characters and subplots ineffectual sheriffs deputies at least one of whom is in league with the bad guys; a Marine dog trainer who is unusually eager to provide classified materials to a teen; the aforementioned gun traffickers engaged in a nonsensical scheme that involves seizing weapons from Afghan insurgents and then re-selling them; cartel thugs who look like theyre about go perform at a wedding and seem awkward lurking around the deciduous forests of North Carolina which doubles here for a Texas border town. Yakins direction is too pedestrian to make much of the crazy-quilt plot; the best that can be said about it is that he handles a couple of dog-on-dog fight scenes with clarity and limits his appeals to the target audiences sense of patriotism to just once every five minutes. (Its unclear whether the Murica t-shirt worn by Justin is ironic or not.) The movies only occasional bright spots come from Churchs committed supporting performance (he was good in Heaven Is For Real too) and from the relationship between Justin and Carmen (Mia Xitlali)--one of the more credible teenage crush objects in recent memory--which provide Max with a handful of grace notes.

Photo Warner Bros. Pictures MOVIE REVIEW Max Running time 110 minutes. Rated PG (action violence/peril). This summers second cinematic Max is less mad than traumatized. Hes a heroic demobilized military dog in this overlong overviolent adventure that amounts to one part ""American Sniper"" for children and two parts ""Courage of Lassie"" (1946) updated to the 21st century. After Maxs Marine handler is killed in an ambush in Afghanistan the dog suffering from PTSD is adopted by the Marines grieving family back in Texas. ""Max"" is mostly about Max saving the Marines younger brother (Josh Wiggins) and father (Thomas Haden Church) from his duplicitous former service buddy (Luke Kleintank) and his gun-dealing Mexican confederates. Director Boaz Yakin (""Remember the Titans"") indulges in an awful lot of gunplay for a PG-rated family film but sure knows how to stage a dirt-bike race. The Belgian malinoises who play Max way out-act the humans.
