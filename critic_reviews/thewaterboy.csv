The formulaic mix of mirth and mayhem is aimed way down the MTV food chain members of which will lap it up for solid opening returns and ancillary action. After decent gains made with ""The Wedding Singer"" an amiable crossover vehicle Adam Sandler scrambles back to his ""SNL"" Cajun Boy persona for ""The Waterboy."" The formulaic mix of mirth and mayhem is aimed way down the MTV food chain members of which will lap it up for solid opening returns and ancillary action. But dont expect the word-of-mouth build of ""Theres Something About Mary"" This yahoos-on-the-bayou farce is neither inventive nor outrageous enough. The big laughs come from a ragtag football team thats so poor its players share a single protective cup so demoralized that the cheerleaders and mascot get tanked every game. As for Sandler he remains an acquired (lack of) taste. His stammering simp and recycled Jerry Lewis shtick would test the patience of even the French. In spots the comic steps out of character his eyes darting sideways to see if anyone is laughing. Needless to say lack of confidence in material this broad doesnt add anything to his delivery. Sandler again teamed with ""Wedding Singer"" director Frank Coraci and writer Tim Herlihy plays Bobby Boucher your proverbial water/whipping boy for Louisiana U.s football team. Though he approaches his job like a city-sewage expert always measuring the pH factor Bobby is used as tackling dummy by the coach (Jerry Reed) and players. Fired for firing back Bobby returns to the arms of Mama Boucher (Kathy Bates) and then signs on with the underdog Mud Dogs led by a hallucinating coach (Henry Winkler). Bobbys temper tantrums make him a natural as defensive tackle. He transfers his pent-up anger to the opposing team and following the formula overcomes 11th-hour adversity to lead his team to victory in the Big Game. Besides Bates who gets into the spirit of things and mugs throughout (but lapses in and out of Cajun patois) pic has cameos by Rob Schneider NFL personalities (including former New York Giant Lawrence Taylor) and -- lending cross-promotional value for Disney -- a number of ABC Sports announcers. Fairuza Balk is sexy and funny as Bobbys bad-girl girlfriend and Winkler underplays nicely as the sometimes addled sometimes cogent coach who sports a tattoo of Roy Orbison on his tush. Larry Gilliard Jr. plays the Mud Dogs nice-guy place-kicker vet Blake Clark has a running routine as an unintelligible Cajun coach and Clint Howard is the fan in the stands inspired by Bobbys gridiron glory. Tech credits are what youd expect of a low-grade genre entry. Those that are a notch above include f/x supervisor David Foggs morphing game faces (when Bobby projects his anger) and production designer Perry Andelin Blakes swamp cabin decorated in road-kill provincial. Vintage hits by Charlie Daniels Creedence Clearwater Revival and others further pics tone and should ensure consolation soundtrack biz for Hollywood Records.

Starring Adam Sandler Kathy Bates Fairuza Balk Jerry Reed Henry Winkler. Directed by Frank Coraci. (PG-13. 86 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""The Waterboy"" is an unabashed wallow in the moronic humor of Adam Sandler -- good news for his fans but most others may want to keep away. Still weve got somewhat entertaining trash here. ""The Waterboy"" which opens today is a likely candidate to grab a spot on the box-office charts pushed by Sandlers loyal following the success of his previous effort ""The Wedding Singer"" and the fact that football season is in full swagger. Related Stories `Waterboy Aims Low and Hits / Sandler comedy wallows in base humor In this gridiron comedy Sandler plays stuttering dimwit Bobby Boucher who comes from a bayou background an uneducated mamas boy who is a total wimp. He gets no respect from the snarling coaches and hulking players he serves as a water boy his only known skill. Actually he takes great pride in being an ace water boy. In his ramshackle swamp home Bobbys mother Mama Boucher (Kathy Bates) is ferociously overbearing. She has hammered two things into his limp brain -- never consort with girls and never play football. Bobbys milquetoast manner is understandable. He is the lowest life form in the pecking order. One day his fortune changes. By calling up certain inner visions Bobby taps into an awesome talent for tackling people. The coach (Henry Winkler) of an inept Louisiana college team decides to deploy him on selective tackling missions and before his astonished eyes the water boy reverses the teams losing streak. It had been the laughingstock of the region. ""The Waterboy"" is base comedy and it makes no apologies for taking cheap shots that many might construe as politically insensitive (especially Sandlers stuttering). Sandler is tedious as the dope often dressed in 70s-style polyester suits and his humor mixing baby talk and Jerry Lewis-style antics is irritating. But this low-budget film has a trashy satirical aim that overrides Sandlers feeble acting while also shoring him up. ""The Waterboy"" is a sometimes wacky send-up of the dumb-jock subculture seen in rowdy Southern style. The country-boy players are brainless grunts the cheerleaders and their dog mascot are drunks an assistant coach (Blake Clark) speaks in an unintelligible Cajun accent that is inspired silliness. Some of the fans are portrayed as inbred rural types folks thrive on barbecued gators a college professor believes he is Colonel Sanders and football fever keeps the Louisiana air thick with the promise of brutality attending the annual Bourbon Bowl. In fact football gets little respect in ""The Waterboy"" which takes aim at the games palooka mentality and never looks back. Real-life people associated with the sport -- announcers Brent Musburger Dan Fouts Lynn Swann and others -- play themselves in spirited self-mocking bits that add a refreshing irreverence. While putting down the game the film adroitly uses crisp well- staged close-up action aimed to appeal to sports fans. When water boy- turned-defensive ace Bobby tackles he really tackles. The intensity is played for antic value but it has visceral impact too. Fairuza Balk (""The Craft"") is a kick as Vicki a slinky outlaw girl who seduces Bobby and faces condemnation by the treacherous Mama Boucher (Bates riotously mocking her own role in ""Misery""). Country singer-songwriter Jerry Reed is almost frighteningly real in his portrayal of a swaggering football coach who will do anything to win.

Lord (and Lorne Michaels) knows canny Sandler has made an inexplicably bright career out of playing a sweet crude dum-dum -- an anarchic king dork with the jaw-jutting clamp-lipped Stan Laurel smile to match. And millions of college-dorm residents (along with their younger brothers) would be happy if he stayed just as infantile as he was in Billy Madison forever. The Wedding Singer retained the anti-intellectual anti-pretentious friendliness thats the comedians best asset dropped the worst of his braying theatrical idiocy and still reassured fans that it was indeed their lovably goofy Saturday Night Live grad in the lead loyal to the teachings of Peter Pan. But the movie also encouraged followers to consider growing up just a little If Sandlers character could hack marriage plans maybe they could oh make their beds once in a while? Gone. All those artistic advances are punted to hell in The Waterboy even though it was made by the Wedding Singer team including director Frank Coraci and writer Tim Herlihy. I wont say that this is the artist at his laziest because in fact hes renowned for being an entertainment Iron Man. But this is certainly Sandler at his cheapest and least focused. Also -- his unfunniest. The big joke is that Bobby Boucher (Sandler) is an uneducated emasculated socially retarded Cajun Boy whose job serving water to college football players has made him the butt of mean jokes for years. His outlandish eccentric hyper-protective mother (Kathy Bates God bless her stashing her Oscar on a shelf where it wont get broken) loves him but at the rate shes going hell end up like Norman Bates. A tough sexy local girl (Fairuza Balk dimming her high-beam eyes) loves him too but Mama has taught her boy that girls are the devil. Its only after Bobby gets a job with the worst team around coached by a broken-down father figure (Henry Winkler ouch) that his true Freud-approved talent gets discovered When he acts on the anger that can overtake a 31-year-old man when his mama is a castrating crazy and almost everyone else humiliates him he proves to be an unstoppable tackler with the power to turn the teams fortunes around. And then the other kids like him Hooray for self-expression Sandler Coraci amp; Co. throw in a lot of low and lower comedy details not that any of them stick Mama shares her swamp-side shack with a mule; the coach has a tattoo of Roy Orbison on his bum; as a local fan SNL colleague Rob Schneider screeches ""You can do eeet"" in an unplaceable accent many times. After the third quarter The Waterboy becomes yet another lame sports farce in which the underdog prevails against great odds the bullies are punished and the hero gets to kiss the girl -- and his mama. Anyone who thinks Im giving away the punchline needs to get out of the house more. D- Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

Unfortunately this film isnt the right vehicle to showcase Sandlers talents. The problem isnt the general perception that this is a moronic sophomoric movie -- that might be more enjoyable (see ""Billy Madison"" or ""Happy Gilmore""). The biggest impediment to this movie is Sandlers speech. His stammering and stuttering prevents the classic Sandler from shining through. I waited the whole movie for him to miraculously metamorphosize into his usual schtick (dont get your hopes up). Thats not to say there arent a few laugh-out-loud sight gags and a couple of good one-liners stolen by mama Kathy Bates. But they cant salvage the formulaic sports movie plot the stereotypical Louisiana characters or the lame role of Henry ""The Fonz"" Winkler as an off-kilter coach. As a whole its not so much stupid as it is boring. Rent it on video -- after you see all the stuff you really want to see. SANDLER RANKING Among Sandler films 1. ""The Wedding Singer"" 2. ""Happy Gilmore"" 3. ""Billy Madison"" 4. ""The Waterboy"" COMEDY RANKING Among other comedies Its above recent Leslie Neilsen spoof films such as ""Wrongfully Accused"" or ""Spy Hard"" but far below ""Theres Something About Mary.""

Siskel amp; Ebert -- two thumbs down USA Today -- ""As funny as it can be this underdawg comedy isnt much more than Sandlers golf-oriented ""Happy Gilmore"" with a Cajun accent."" 2 1/2 stars out of 4 All photos courtesy Touchstone Pictures.

"The Waterboy (PG-13) Related Item ""The Waterboy"" showtimes The Waterboy By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday November 6 1998 Adam Sandler plays a football waterboy who turns into the teams leading tackler. (Touchstone) Director Frank Coraci Cast Adam Sandler; Rob Schneider; Fairuza Balk; Kathy Bates; Henry Winkler Running Time 1 hour 26 minutes For some profanity a glimpse of tattooed buttocks comic gridiron violence and sexual innuendos Adam Sandlers cretinous Canteen Boy and irritating Opera Man characters (regularly featured on ""Saturday Night Live"") used to give me epileptic seizures. In his incipient film career Sandler continued to relish playing grating losers (""Happy Gilmore"" ""Billy Madison"") - that is until last winters endearing ""The Wedding Singer"" which showed him to be a genial actor capable of playing ""normal"" and still making people laugh. What went wrong? ""Wedding Singer"" director Frank Coraci writer Tim Herlihy and star Sandler have teamed up for ""The Waterboy"" to create yet another film about . . . a cretinous grating loser. They must think theres an audience for his mental-defective shtick and I suppose there is because I sat in one recently for a screening of the story of Bobby Boucher (Sandler) a dim-witted 31-year-old college football water boy who becomes the teams leading tackler. The mostly college-age crowd ate up the sophomoric humor with a spoon (actually Im not sure many of them know how to use silverware) even applauding at the formulaic come-from-behind gridiron victories - a reaction I can only attribute to Redskins Withdrawal Syndrome. Kathy Bates should fire the agent who got her the gig playing Bobbys swamp-trash mama and Fairuza Balk typecast as Bobbys girlfriend Vicki Vallencourt seems to be carving out a nice niche for herself as The Slutty Biker Chick. The rest of the cast is rounded out by such film giants as Rob Schneider and Clint Howard as moronic bumpkins and as Bobbys beleaguered coach Henry Winkler looking like a trapped and frightened animal.
