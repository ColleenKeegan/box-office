What we didnt know before is that down there amid the rubble is the billionaire Bruce Wayne trying with limited success to rescue workers at a local branch of Wayne Enterprises from the collateral destruction. Related Story The Trouble With Superman Theres the germ of an interesting idea here. The Man of Steel director Zack Snyder took a fair amount of grief for the way that movie casually depopulated an American city however fictional. In Snyders retelling here Bruce Wayne (a.k.a. obviously Batman) essentially becomes the voice of those critics. Is Superman really a hero? Or is he just some alien interloper who brought his extraterrestrial vendettas to our humble planet knocking down an entire urban skyline in the process? In the hands of another director--the Christopher Nolan of the Dark Knight movies or the Bryan Singer of the X-Men films come immediately to mind--this and other moral quandaries might have been drawn out in intriguing ways.Instead alas we have Snyder whose idea of a moral quandary is should I make this scene grim--or grimmer? Loud--or louder? Violent--or more violent still? Its thus no surprise that after all its early ostentatious handwringing Batman v Superman ends almost exactly as its predecessor did with another dull city-smashing duel between super-beings. The only surprise is that the movie recalls its animating premise vaguely enough to bother explaining that the neighborhood being leveled this time around is ""uninhabited."" No harm no foul.Such thematic carelessness is on constant display which wouldnt loom as nearly so large a problem if Snyders film didnt advertise its aspirations to Moral Seriousness in almost every plodding humorless frame. There are endless disquisitions about whether Batman is good for Gotham and Superman good for the Earth and tedious evocations of the roles of ""gods"" and ""men."" Yet the actual characters themselves never come to life as anything other than symbols to be clumsily bickered over.We know for instance that Lex Luthor (played by Jesse Eisenberg as a young tech magnate) hates Superman (Henry Cavill) primarily because we knew as much before the movie even started. And other than a kind of whiny inchoate envy thats all the motivation he evidently needs. Likewise we know that Lois Lane (a thoroughly wasted Amy Adams) loves Superman because a) she keeps saying so; and b) that is her principal plot function. (Well that and requiring the Man of Steel to rescue her from certain death at frequent intervals--there are times when its hard to believe that this movie was made in 2016.) As for Loiss heartfelt question ""I just dont know if its possible for you to love me and be you"" I would refer her to Larry Nivens dispositive 1969 essay ""Man of Steel Woman of Kleenex.""Batman v Superman ends almost exactly as its predecessor did with another dull city-smashing duel between super-beings.And when it comes to Diana Prince (a.k.a. Wonder Woman and played by Gal Gadot) over the course of two and a half hours we learn precisely nothing about her other than she fought in World War I became disillusioned with mankinds senseless cruelty and has now reappeared 100 years later with a taste for high-end couture that displays large strategically selected expanses of bare skin. (She reserves her famous red-and-blue one-piece for the final act.)Which brings us to Batman/Bruce Wayne played with grumpy intensity--and poor shaving habits--by Ben Affleck. The idea of the clash between him and Superman is loosely lifted from Frank Millers seminal 1986 comic series The Dark Knight Returns. In that telling Batman was a bitter 55-year-old super-retiree whose vigilante methods were of such concern to the U.S. government that it enlisted Superman to rein him in. This time around however the roles are mostly inverted with Superman as the potential threat to order--a U.S. Senator played by Holly Hunter pops up periodically to raise this question--and Batman the potential remedy.But following the initial loss of life at Wayne Enterprises Batmans motivations become vague bordering on incomprehensible. The closest he comes to articulating them is when he explains to his butler Alfred (now played by Jeremy Irons in a perhaps inevitable passing of the generational torch from Michael Caine) ""He has the power to wipe out the human race. And if we think that theres even a one percent chance that hes our enemy we have to treat it as an absolute certainty."" This may be the most ostentatiously shoddy logic deployed by a theoretically brilliant character in recent movie history.Make no mistake Batman doesnt want merely to limit Supermans super-prerogatives or to come up with a contingency plan in case he goes rogue or even to confine him somewhere. He wants quite explicitly to kill Superman. Again in the proper hands (such as Frank Millers 30 years ago) the idea of a quasi-insane Batman might bear interesting fruit. But Snyders Batman is all over the map suave and rational one moment and snarling belligerent threats the next. At one point he taunts Superman like an overly theatrical WWF heel ""Tell me do you bleed? You will."" What has Superman done to merit this degree of hatred? Leveled another city? Killed the president? Declared war on puppies? Nope. Alien monster that he is hes messed up the Batmobile.Snyders Batman is all over the map suave and rational one moment and snarling belligerent threats the next.I will not go further into the plot of the movie in part because Snyder has made an explicit plea that reviews avoid spoilers and in part because the screenplay by Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer is a tangled mess of awkwardly entwined storylines. Even on questions as straightforward as whether this Batman is a continuation of Nolans Dark Knight or a reboot the movie seems unable to decide. On the one hand it presents us yet again with the robbery-murder of young Bruce Waynes parents perhaps the scene in all popular cinema that least needed to be portrayed anew. (This time though his mothers pearls tumble to the ground in slow motion.) On the other it presumes that we already know all about Alfred the Bat Cave and so on.As its subtitle announces Batman v Superman is a setup for Snyders upcoming Justice League movie in conscious apery of the world-building that Marvel Studios has been undertaking for almost a decade. But whereas Marvel produced five superhero features before assembling its heroes in The Avengers Warner Bros. has no such patience with its DC properties. (Justice League Part One is due out next year.) Nowhere is this impatience more evident than in a remarkably lame narrative shortcut in which Bruce Wayne happens upon a ""metahuman"" supercut of footage that introduces Wonder Woman the Flash Aquaman and Cyborg in the course of approximately two minutes. Glad thats out of the way guysSuch shoddiness is characteristic of the entire script. Though there are several scenes illustrating the extent of Supermans super-speed he never seems to use it when its most needed--for example as he stands around watching Batman prepare to hurl what he already knows to be a deadly kryptonite grenade. One crucial plot twist depends entirely on the coincidence of two characters having relatives with the same first name. (Though the moment is intended to be one of profound emotion there was open laughter in the screening I attended.) And the biggest twist of all is one that was rendered implausible by a vision of the future that Batman had already experienced--a vision incidentally that will be utterly incomprehensible to all but the most devout DC fans.Affleck is solid as Batman at least insofar as the script allows him to be. Cavill though again fails to sell the Man of Steel persuasively and Gadot makes almost no impression at all in her underwritten role. But its Eisenberg who really stands out in the film and not in a good way. Ive been a fan of the actor dating back to 2002s Roger Dodger but his twerpy take on Lex Luthor is almost unwatchable Petulant melodramatic hyperactive and entitled he comes across like an improbable--and thoroughly unappetizing--blend of Tracy Flick and the Joker. One almost wonders whether Eisenbergs mocking sendup of film reviewers in The New Yorker last December was intended as a bit of critical inoculation.Ultimately though the central flaw of Batman v Superman is Snyders trademark tone which alternates between angry and maudlin with little in between. Almost the entire film seems to be set at night as if it were taking place in Mordor or perhaps Anchorage in December. And Hans Zimmers clamorous punishing score was still reverberating in my fillings for hours after the movie was over. In the end Batman v Superman is a tiresome ill-tempered film and one too lazy even to earn its dismal outlook.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side.

Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz.

Khizr Khan began his speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday with words I wish he didnt have to say ""Tonight we are honored to stand here as parents of Captain Humayun Khan and as patriotic American Muslims--as patriotic American Muslims with undivided loyalty to our country."" I wish he and his wife didnt have to stand there as the parents of a 27-year-old Army captain who was killed by suicide bombers while serving in the Iraq War. And I wish Khizr Khan hadnt felt the need to declare his patriotism and loyalty to the United States of America. Those truths should have been self-evident. The state of the union is not strong when an American feels compelled to clarify such things. In better times Khizr Khan who was born in Pakistan and moved to America from the United Arab Emirates might have begun his speech with what he said next ""Like many immigrants we came to this country empty-handed. We believed in American democracy--that with hard work and [the] goodness of this country we could share in and contribute to its blessings.""

James Fallows None Mark Salter former chief of staff to Sen. John McCain has written an essay for Real Clear Politics on why he cannot vote for Donald Trump. It deserves note for the long-term record because this is not how associates of a partys former nominee usually talk about the current one and because of its insistence on the importance of tax returns. Salter concludes (emphasis added) Could it be that a major party nominee for president is beholden to Russias leader and might compromise the security interests of the U.S. and our allies to maintain that relationship?  We dont know the answer.... We cant begin to answer the question until Trump releases his tax returns for the last several years. The media should make this the focus of every interview with Trump and senior Trump staff. The Republican Party chairman should urge him to release his returns. The Republican leadership in Congress should insist on it. Every American voter should demand it. There are legitimate suspicions about whether Trumps business relationships could compromise his loyalty to our country. Unless and until he puts them to rest not by dismissing them but by disproving them he should be considered unfit to hold the office of president.

Graham The State Department is reopening its investigation into Hillary Clintons emails just as she puts a Justice Department investigation behind her. Hillary Clinton is out of the frying pan and into the fire. On July 6 Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that the Justice Department would not pursue criminal charges against the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee for her use of a private email server at the State Department. But the following day with that criminal investigation closed the State Department reopened its own probe into the emails the AP reported. State Department spokesman John Kirby told the AP that it would be looking at potential mishandling of classified information by Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Former officials could face administrative sanctions including a loss of their security clearances--a step that would be both politically embarrassing for Clinton and complicate efforts to staff a national-security team should she prevail in November.

By Anthony Lane Credit Illustration by Diego Patino Were you one of those lucky viewers who were watching TV in 1987 when ""The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones"" aired? Did it give you a craving for crossovers so ravenous that not even ""Alien vs. Predator"" (2004) could sate it? Well your time has come. ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice"" is here. You could argue that the Avengers movies beat it to the punch; to the purist however those are not so much authentic crossovers as kindly support groups where people with a wide range of personality disorders can meet under the Marvel banner and exchange thumps. Batman and Superman on the other hand are ideally matched numbly heroic bulging in all the right places and bent on busting crime in the permanent hope that nobody will notice how dull they are. Unless you count the time when they went to the same dry cleaner to get soup stains out of their capes they have never been introduced. Until now. Superman is played as in ""Man of Steel"" (2013) by Henry Cavill whereas Ben Affleck is a novice in the part of Batman. A curious choice especially in the light of ""Hollywoodland"" (2006) where he excelled in the role of George Reeves who starred as Superman on TV in the early nineteen-fifties loathed the experience and died of a gunshot to the head. It was hardly a movie to brighten ones faith in comic books. Since then Affleck has become a director of steady and satisfying thrillers including ""The Town"" and ""Argo"" so why risk this backward step into the realm of beefcake? Maybe he relished the gleam of the supporting cast--Holly Hunter Diane Lane Laurence Fishburne and Kevin Costner with Amy Adams as Lois Lane Jesse Eisenberg as a jittery Lex Luthor and Jeremy Irons taking over from Michael Caine as Alfred the venerable butler-cum-weapons designer to Bruce Wayne. Its quite a lineup and not one of them goes unwasted. All are sacrificed to the plot--the usual farrago of childhood trauma lumps of kryptonite and panic in the streets--or rather to the very loud noises that the plot creates. The director is Zack Snyder who was responsible for ""300"" (2006) ""Watchmen"" (2009) ""Man of Steel"" and other Chekhovian chamber pieces and whom I suspect of having worked for NutriBullet before he joined the movie business. When in doubt he simply slings another ingredient into the mix be it an irradiated monster an explosion on government premises or the sharp smack of masonry on skull. Then theres the music. Hans Zimmer seldom the most placid of composers is joined on this occasion by Junkie XL and we should give thanks for their combined efforts which render large portions of the dialogue by Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer blessedly inaudible. The drawling Irons does now and then signal his fatigue at the whole enterprise (""Even youve got too old to die young"" Alfred says to his master) and there is one other good line but its stolen from Cole Porter so that doesnt count. When fans flock to this movie it will be not for Batman or Superman alone but for the sake of the preposition in the title. To be blunt how big is that ""v""? You cant accuse Snyder of tamping it down; his chief promoter is Luthor who calls it ""the greatest gladiatorial contest in the history of the world"" and suggests a number of suitable tags--blue vs. black dark vs. light Coke vs. Pepsi and so on. In the event the bout is like any other slugfest with Batman warned by the referee for using nasty green krypto-gas in the fourth round and his opponent hitting back strongly in the ninth. The winner on points is Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) who crashes the party and leaves them both dumbfounded not least because she has the wit and the wherewithal to confront evil while wearing a conical bustier. And that is that except that the film determined to hit the two-and-a-half-hour mark has fifteen more minutes to fill. These are jammed with peekaboo teasers for sequels since DC comics like Marvel require that movies do their own marketing. The Dawn of Justice may be over but the lunchtime of justice is still to come and after that the cocktail hour of revenge. I cant wait. If you really want Batman and Superman to settle their differences park them in front of the new Alexander Sokurov film ""Francofonia"" and invite them to hammer out the role of historiography in modern Russian cinema. Thatll shut them up. Its a challenge to pin down where and when ""Francofonia"" is set since time and space for Sokurov are there to be outwitted as much as honored. At the start we hear an orchestra tuning up the plaint of seagulls and the crackle of a ship-to-shore conversation with the captain of a container vessel. Only then are we granted something to look at a photograph of the aged Tolstoy and a nameless voice that asks as if unnerved ""Why is he staring at me like that?"" What matters at this point as Sokurov admirers can confirm is to hold your nerve and to trust that all these strands will be threaded into the weave of a larger design. Much of the movie is spent in Paris--specifically at the Louvre. Sokurovs ""Russian Ark"" (2002) was a magniloquent tribute to the Hermitage in St. Petersburg and to judge by the latest film his fascination with our need to build strongholds of art and to weatherproof them against the storms of revolution and conflict remains undimmed. ""Where would we be without museums?"" the voice inquires. (It is Sokurov himself speaking on our behalf.) His camera stops to gaze at portraits peering close enough to inspect cracks in the pigment while actors playing Marianne (the traditional figurehead of France) and Napoleon stroll through the empty galleries. ""Cest moi"" Bonaparte declares beside the vast portrayal of his coronation. Then comes the Mona Lisa. ""Cest moi"" he says again. There are jokes in Sokurov but they tend to be lugubrious muffled in the drapery of the past. In truth Im not convinced that Sokurov is at his best among well-known figures. He is certainly drawn to them ""Moloch"" (1999) is about Hitler and Goebbels ""Telets"" (2001) is about Lenin and ""The Sun"" (2005) is about Emperor Hirohito. But there is modesty and slyness in Sokurov as well as a taste for the broad sweep of history and this is where ""Francofonia"" scores guiding us into the shadowy alcoves that house the barely remembered. We are introduced for instance to Jacques Jaujard the director of French museums including the Louvre under Nazi rule and Count Franz Wolff Metternich the high-ranking German officer who oversaw the preservation of artifacts and buildings in Occupied France. Both men fought in the First World War. Neither was at ease in the Second. You would expect Sokurov to assemble the facts about these men into a documentary. Instead he embarks on a dramatic reconstruction of their meeting asking ""Were we to imagine how this took place might it have been like this?"" From here on they are played by actors--the Frenchman by Louis-Do de Lencquesaing and the German by Benjamin Utzerath. To complicate things their scenes look hazy and speckled like clips of archival footage. In a similar vein a panoramic shot of the Louvre as it exists today with I. M. Peis glass pyramid standing proud in the courtyard is made to resemble a hand-tinted vintage postcard feathery at the edges. Old and new are interlaced and the result comes as close as movies can to the books of W. G. Sebald who slipped like a spy across the borders between fiction illustration the essay form and mourning for the lost. Visual mutation is a habit with Sokurov. In the ominously beautiful ""Mother and Son"" (1997) the images of rural Russia stretched and yawned as if the director impatient with the solid shapes on which regular cinema relies felt compelled to morph them to his purpose. ""Francofonia"" is less extreme but it still refuses to settle into a period or a style. Occasionally we revert to the ship that we heard from at the outset which is bearing a cargo of museum treasures and foundering in savage seas. ""The connection is gone again"" someone says as the screen disintegrates into pixels. The symbolism of this--be careful or culture will fall overboard--is top-heavy with solemnity and when I first saw the movie at a festival it wavered on the brink of the precious. That changed on a second viewing. Most of ""Francofonia"" now seems tender stirring and imperilled from the polite and awkward pact between Jaujard and Wolff Metternich who in a happier world would have been friends to the masterpieces that were removed from the Louvre before the Germans arrived and stored in country houses. We see Gericaults ""The Raft of the Medusa"" (another vessel in trouble) stacked casually against a cellar wall and the Winged Victory of Samothrace being hoisted into the air. Thousands of years after it was carved it flies at last.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Clay Enos/Courtesy of Warner Brothers Comic books from several discrete decades get mashed up in Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice while swaths of real estate -- uninhabited swaths were repeatedly assured -- just get pulped. But no text is quoted more directly than The Dark Knight Returns Frank Millers influential 1986 tale of an over-the-hill Batman coming out of retirement to clean up a Gotham gone to hell. It was the greatest Batman story ever told and it had the unforeseen side effect of draining every particle of sunlight out of superhero stories for years to come. But it hit far beyond the normal comics readership foretelling our current era of superheroes as mainstream entertainment for grownups and it helped publisher DC Comics briefly eclipse its chief rival Marvel. Movie Reviews Fun And Entertainment Are Collateral Damage In Batman V Superman Batman V Superman Female Producer Working To Get More Women Behind Camera Listen  352 352 Toggle more options Download Embed Embed Transcript I bore you with this history because a generation later DC -- the home of Superman and Wonder Woman and the Elongated Man and Matter-Eater Lad -- is chasing Marvel once again. DC was first to box office success by decades scoring massive hits with Richard Donners Superman in 1978 and Tim Burtons Batman in 1989. But the interconnected fictive universe wherein different heroes stories overlap endlessly? Only Marvel has brought that to the movies and only after it stopped licensing out its most popular characters (Spider-Man the ever-shifting lineup of X-Men) and got into the biz itself. 2008s Iron Man was the test balloon. Now Marvel has a movie about The Inhumans on the way a group of heroes (Im guessing) that even a lapsed comic book nerd like me couldnt pick out of my Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe if the entries werent alphabetized. Knowing exactly nothing about it I have to figure The Inhumans will be more fun to sit through than Batman v Superman from Zack Snyder the same guy who brought DCs other influential 1986 comic book to the screen in Watchmen. That film was R-rated and long and grim and dark and violent averaging roughly one joke per 40 minutes. But it looks like Pee-wees Big Adventure next to BvS a ponderous smothering over-pixelated zeppelin crash of a movie scored by a choir that sounds like its being drowned in lava. This is what happens when you give a bad director a quarter-billion or so dollars while doing all you possibly can to make sure every creative decision he makes is motivated by sheer panic Catch Marvel Set up the next 10 movies BvS has no room to breathe even at 151 minutes 30 or 40 of which offer actual pleasure. Heres the good 23 percent Ben Affleck and Jeremy Irons have a nice rapport as Batman and butler/co-conspirator Alfred Pennyworth now 20 years (and one dead sidekick) into the Batmans campaign of broken-kneecaps policing. (The Bat-Signal atop police headquarters suggests detente in law enforcement-vigilante relations but a Gotham cop still shoots at Batman for some reason.) New-gal Gal Gadot makes an appealingly enigmatic Wonder Woman if only because shes not forced to speak what should remain subtext the way everyone else is. Laurence Fishburne returning from 2013s Snyder-directed reboot Man of Steel gives the film a badly needed jolt of levity in his handful of scenes as Daily Planet editor Perry White. In BvSs sole inventive flourish the chief complaint about its predecessor -- Supermans failure to prevent a civilian body count in the thousands -- is appropriated as Batmans motivation to take him down. The Battle of Metropolis is reprised from Bruce Waynes point of view and psychologically linked to the murder of his parents back in um 1981. And at last we get the montage of Superman doing super deeds that Man of Steel denied us He saves flood victims stranded atop their homes he preserves the crew of an exploding rocket he rescues a lady from a burning Mexico City high-rise. Instead of instantly blasting off to be the deus ex machina in another out-of-frame drama he hangs around long enough for the Mexican crowd many in Day of the Dead regalia to lay hands on him. This scene looks like a Renaissance painting and it conveys Supermans crisis of faith over whether he can actually inspire noble acts more eloquently than any of the movies many thudding conversations on the subject. These mostly involve Amy Adams Lois Lane or Holly Hunters Sen. Somebody. (Wait -- Finch. Sen. Finch.) Maybe they tried to cast actors whose names sound like secret identities. But Henry Cavill has been turned into a clay-footed Man of Steel scrubbed of the humility and warmth he brought to his first flight. You cant blame his Kal-El for feeling hot and cold toward our kind considering that Metropolis has erected a tacky statue in his honor at the same time he is being summoned before a Senate panel to ... explain how he saved Lois from mercenaries in the African nation of ""Nairomi."" Or something. Few films with ""versus"" in their title have ever been this hard to follow. Still I perked up when Superman walked into the Capitol because I desperately wanted to hear him say something homespun and ennobling. (""Its not an S. On my world it means hope"" was a good line.) But writers David Goyer and Chris Terrio never give him the chance. When it comes to what exactly superheroes are supposed to do -- buck up our own reserves of integrity and charity -- they let Jesse Eisenbergs twitchy Lex Luthor do all the talking. Thats a major error but not as bad as Warner Bros. DCs corporate parent made when they decided they no longer have enough confidence in their flagship character to let this latest iteration of Superman carry another film or two before making him the Aaron Burr to Batmans Hamilton. They took away Supermans second chance -- or maybe his second second chance after 2006s mopey but underappreciated Superman Returns -- and worse entrusted this film and its already announced two Justice League follow-ups to Snyder. He is to filmmaking what artists like Rob Liefeld and Todd McFarlane are to comics good at images hopeless at storytelling. BvS is confusing before it gets boring and boring before it gets bruising. But it hits all the dreary stations of the superhero cross eventually. Is it an accident the movie originally slated for last summer is coming out on Good Friday? As with last years Marvel bonanza Avengers Age of Ultron theres an out-of-nowhere dream-or-prophecy interlude that we can only infer will be explained in some other flick a year or three from now. In BvS that wacko hallucination is more intriguing than the film it interrupts. Even the things the widely reviled Man of Steel did right -- Hans Zimmers stirring score Alex McDowells otherworldly production design Cavills warm smile in the last shot of the movie -- are all buried here. And Wonder Womans feats of strength against a generic computer-generated monster in the third act arent nearly compensation enough for the sad fact that both of the women in Kals life -- Lois and his adopted ma Martha Kent (Diane Lane) -- get used as Super-bait and pushed around. Once upon a time Margot Kidders Lois contrived to prove Clark Kent was really Superman by throwing herself off a building. OK it was Niagara Falls. My point stands.

Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures hide caption toggle caption Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures Director Zack Snyder plays to his strengths laying on the moody atmospherics. Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures Its been three years since the Superman movie Man of Steel arrived in theaters -- three years in which DC Comics has released no other superhero movies. Meanwhile its rival Marvel has earned more than 9 billion from a dozen men-in-spandex films. So the Man of Steel sequel a ponderously overlong epic called Batman V Superman Dawn of Justice (that solitary ""V"" being pretty much the only thing abbreviated about it) has some serious catching up to do. Easier said than done since its freighted not so much with entertainment value as it is with enough talk of fallen gods absent parents and dissolute heroes to fuel a Greek tragedy. And for much of the films 2 1/2 hours director Zack Snyder seems convinced that thats what hes making. Or as bad guy Lex Luthor puts it in an unedited stream-of-consciousness attempt at pizazz ""A battle to the death black and blue fight night the greatest gladiator match in the history of the world God versus man day versus night son of Krypton versus Bat of Gotham."" It takes a while to pit these two iconic good guys against each other but the script gives them reasons. Straight-arrow Clark Kent goes after vigilantes both as a reporter for the Daily Planet and as a superdude in a cape because he feels guilty that whole blocks of Metropolis got wiped out along with the bad guys at the end of his last movie. i Gal Gadots Wonder Woman is the secret weapon for late in the film. Shell doubtless get to do more next time. Clay Enos/Courtesy of Warner Bros Pictures hide caption toggle caption Clay Enos/Courtesy of Warner Bros Pictures Gal Gadots Wonder Woman is the secret weapon for late in the film. Shell doubtless get to do more next time. Clay Enos/Courtesy of Warner Bros Pictures Brooding bat-suited billionaire Bruce Wayne blames Superman for that collateral damage. And worries that its just the start. ""He has the power to wipe out the entire human race"" he says. ""And if we believe theres an even 1 percent chance that hes our enemy we have to take it as an absolute certainty."" Not sure about that 1 percent/absolute certainty matchup but hey ... these guys are smart. Surely they can talk things out. Alas Lex Luthor is the one doing the introductions. Jesse Eisenberg mostly manages to make Lex Luthor an annoying villain rather than an alarming one. But Ben Afflecks graying Batman owns the alarm concession anyway -- growling prowling literally branding bad guys. Henry Cavills Superman is comparatively subdued floating down majestically from on high lips curled with what looks like indigestion. The half of the film not devoted to establishing why theyre fighting is devoted to making the fight seem plausibly even. Batman is after all a guy with gizmos ... not superpowers. Everyone acts up a storm plumbing psychological nuances that are not really what most people go to superhero epics for. But whats a poor studio to do when Marvel has pretty much cornered the jokey ironic detachment market? Director Snyder plays to what I suppose you have to call his strengths. He lays on the moody atmospherics and Hans Zimmers score while keeping the images grand enough to support the obligatory special-effects dust-up with a monster in the final reel. The filmmakers save a secret weapon for that battle Wonder Woman who shows up more or less unannounced to toss her lasso and brandish her shield. Gal Gadot will doubtless get to do more next time. And yeah there will be a next time even if this time has turned out to be a lot less fun than it should be.

Entertainment ""Batman v Superman"" Is Not The Important Movie It Wants So Badly To Be Zack Snyders new superhero movie doesnt reinvent the genre or even do anything interesting with it but boy does it try. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Henry Cavill in Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice. Warner Bros. ID 8292075 Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice turns Lex Luthor into a tech bro. Played by Jesse Eisenberg this new version of Supermans archenemy is a twitchy fast-talker in a graphic tee and blazer with shoulder-length hair (yes theyre some luxuriant locks) shooting hoops in LexCorps in-office basketball court while plotting how to disrupt superheroics using the scraps of Kryptonite hes been buying up. Hes positioned (at least at first) to be Mark Zuckerberg as a supervillain He treats government regulations as a jumping-off point for negotiations rather than as rules to be followed making grand pronouncements about superpower humans as ""the basis for our myths"" while he bargains for special access to Kryptonian tech under the table.This take on Lex is -- like the placement of Gotham and Metropolis as Oakland-San Francisco sibling cities -- provocative...or it would be were it better developed if it didnt turn out to be a surface-level reworking of your standard-issue megalomaniac. Eisenbergs performance has the trappings of a techno libertarian tweaked into exaggerated comic book nastiness with none of the follow-through. Lex ultimately plots to take down Superman due to daddy issues and something-or-other about God but mostly because taking down Superman is what Lex Luthor is supposed to do. View this image > Jesse Eisenberg Warner Bros. ID 8292100 Like so much of Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice which was directed by Man of Steels Zack Snyder the blatant millennial-fication of Lex Luthor is an intriguing tease to some grander reading that simply isnt there. The film is a lumbering glum cool-toned behemoth that labors to lay groundwork for a DC cinematic universe while setting up two famous characters on a collision course and lobs out big ideas like an underprepared undergrad sweatily pitching off-the-cuff thesis topics. Superman (Henry Cavill) the movie submits is a messianic figure a giver of hope floating beatifically midair with his cape flapping around him while supplicants reach out in tears more important as a symbol than as a man of individual actions. Superman is also a little like America in terms of international intervention He requires you to trust that his actions are all in the interest of the greater good -- because what are you going to do fight the guy? Its fine when hes saving people from a flaming building but when he crashes (in what Deadpool has dubbed the ""superhero landing"") into a tense situation in Africa involving Lois (Amy Adams given a gratifying amount to do) his interference sparks unforeseen consequences. View this image > Ben Affleck Warner Bros. ID 8292113 Batman (Ben Affleck) on the other hand takes the micro to Supermans macro as a self-appointed answer to Gothams governmental failings policing the streets in a way that doesnt have to reckon with inconvenient rights and processes. Hes rage disguised as righteousness a one-man militia in bulky Bat-armor righting the wrongs that the cops cant manage to keep up with. Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice begins by running us through young Bruce Waynes oft-documented parental trauma once more before catching up with him as an embittered incredibly ripped fortysomething whos maybe losing his grip a little living down the road from the burned remains of Wayne Manor with his butler-turned-co-conspirator Alfred (Jeremy Irons). This road-worn version of Batman is vengeful and exacting unafraid to kill and inclined to literally brand the criminals he catches with his logo a mark that (were told) dooms them when they go to prison.Batmans a vigilante and Supermans a god which is the basis of their disagreement though lord almighty does the movie take a long time laying that out. In the hour-and-a-half lead-up to the promised showdown disagreements between the two simmer and build and are partially articulated during a cocktail party encounter between Bruce and Clark Kent in which they politely snipe at each other about superhero puff pieces and ""civil liberties being trampled."" What neither arrive at (though they should) is that Batman and Superman actually both do what they want and answer to no one and that they should stop talking since incredibly they both lack self-awareness. The film doesnt find space to fill their characters out in more than broad swaths but manages to make them both unappealing having a superheroic pissing match that turns into literal grappling over the moral high ground. Its an unusual achievement in a superhero if not the one that Snyder and writers Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer were likely aiming for making two iconic characters look like political candidates in a race in which theres no desirable winner. View this image > Ben Affleck Warner Bros. ID 8292154 In an early sequence -- one of the best in the movie and definitely the most evocative -- we see the World Engine battle from the finale of Man of Steel from the ground as Bruce races through the streets of Metropolis just in time to see his own building crumble with some employees still trapped inside. From Supermans perspective it was a fight to save humanity from extinction. From Bruces point of view it was a melee unfolding with no concern for collateral damage one that costs peoples lives for whom he feels directly responsible. The mid-city havoc-wreaking brawl seems like it would tee the movie up to grapple with the notions of ""the greater good"" versus innocent lives lost versus ""Why couldnt you have fought over the goddamn ocean or something?"" But it doesnt Instead the scene is used in order to get Batman thinking that if there is even the slightest chance of Superman breaking bad hes got to go. View this image > Gal Gadot Warner Bros. ID 8292178 Its a false opposition these two points of view that have been placed counter to each other. Theyre just guys scrimmaging over whose version of saving the world is better when natch their goals are compatible. Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice is grimly self-serious; at one point it even summons Superman for a congressional hearing. But the film is not morally complex especially when it comes to the idea of self-appointed heroes -- its all for the rights and the responsibilities of the superheroic class to help out as they see fit no matter how many panic dreams (or are they visions?) Batman has of a scary Supes gone rogue. If the two superheroes want to have a fight in the middle of an urban center well thats whats going to happen and thats how Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice brings the action back around without any apparent irony. This time the battles in Gotham where the urban decay works in the combatants favor by giving them unpopulated acreage to destroy. And this time Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) is there to help the whole movie and she steals it just by virtue of looking like shes having a good time whether shes trading barbs with Bruce at a posh party or grinning at a lumpy monster inserted into the final act of the movie to enable a big calamitous finish.In 2005 Christopher Nolan whos an executive producer on this film made Batman Begins -- a very good superhero movie And in 2008 he made The Dark Knight -- a very good movie period which changed old-fashioned perceptions of what could be achieved in the genre. But it created a model of what an ""important"" superhero pic looks like with which Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice is hopelessly enamored despite the fact it doesnt come close to pulling off the same tricks in trying to pass off dourness as intelligence. Talking heads debate evolution and myth on television; the public turns on a dime from venerating Superman as though he liberated a nation to burning him in effigy. And Bruce having devoted his life to punishing wrongdoers decides his best legacy might as well be a murderous one. None of it adds up to anything except a world in which superheroes are unavoidable -- smashing through buildings and setting up sequels by watching sneak previews of future Justice League colleagues.

A clash of comic-book titans. A blockbuster decades in the making. A chance for Ben Afflecks mighty chin to one-up Henry Cavills dimpled masterpiece. (It is not alas a small-claims case winding its way through Gothams judicial system.) But more than any of those things BvS represents the hopes and dreams of its studio Warner Bros. and even the future of Hollywood itself. Video Video How Gal Gadot brought Wonder Woman to life in Batman v Superman Video Video Amy Adams explains why the world is in a vulnerable place Video Video Affleck and Cavill joke about driving the Batmobile The new film is ostensibly a sequel to Snyders 2013 epic Man of Steel in which Cavills Clark Kent tried to live a normal life when not inadvertently inflicting a massacre upon Metropolis during a fight with his Kryptonian nemesis. But instead of being another solo Supes adventure BvS ups the ante to include everyones favourite orphan vigilante and a half-dozen other DC Comics characters who Warner hopes will carry their own franchises some day soon. So soon in fact that Warner has mapped out nine DC films until the year 2020 with one (Suicide Squad) opening this summer and three others (Wonder Woman Justice League Part One and Aquaman) in various stages of production.Its all part of a bid to compete with Disneys game-changing ""Marvel Cinematic Universe"" which counts the likes of Iron Man Captain America Thor and the Avengers films as part of its ridiculously successful brand - a brand that has changed the very nature of blockbuster filmmaking. You can see the ripple effects in everything from the endless Fast and Furious franchise to the rapidly expanding Star Wars galaxy. Films cannot exist on their own any more - each must instead be a marketing plank that leads to another.To catch up Warner has bet half a decade worth of development and billions of dollars on the back of Snyders vision. Well you win some you lose some. BvS is not only an embarrassing effort to kick-start a business plan it is a shambolic ill-advised white-hot mess of a movie. During its two-and-a-half bewildering hours BvS piles bad decision upon bad decision as if Snyder decided to pull a Springtime for Hitler on Warner and turn in something so wrong-headed and offensive that it could only succeed by failing.To be clear the superhero genre is not an easy one to screw up. The Marvel films have proven time and again that even the blandest of filmmakers can succeed given a few key elements to play with humour sharp casting a sense that one story affects an entire universe of others. Maybe a talking tree were not picky. These are lessons that Snyder must have recognized taken a good look at and then thrown in a dumpster - which he then promptly set on fire.There are so many baffling elements to BvS that singling out any one is to be paralyzed by choice. Where to start? Perhaps its with Snyders approach to his title heroes who he doesnt seem to like all that much. Snyders Superman is not a paragon of virtue and selflessness so much as he is kind of a jerk. Kal-El sneers sulks and lashes out. Its a complete mishandling of the character who at his best inspires hope and courage not fear and disgust.Perhaps though Supermans shabby treatment was chosen so wed more easily identify with Bruce Waynes bizarre determination to beat the guy up. The films title promises a battle royale so theres got to be something worth tussling about. In this case Snyder torques Supermans altruistic persona by positioning him as a careless weapon of mass destruction with Afflecks Wayne as the worlds last rational man a pessimistic pragmatist who believes that the God-like Kent must be controlled. Plus Superman seems awfully smug so hey maybe Batman should just kill the guy?This is the question that the films first hour and a half sluggishly ponders adding in all sorts of pointless distractions to the mix. This includes but is not limited to a subplot about African arms dealers; the threat of a dirty bomb; the political quest of a man who lost his legs during Supermans Man of Steel shenanigans; the nonsensical machinations of Lex Luthor played with delirious Zuckerbergian glee by Jesse Eisenberg; newspaper editor Perry Whites insane budget requests; Michael Shannons magical General Zod corpse; a Kryptonian version of Siri that lives inside a crashed spaceship; and a U.S. senator played by Holly Hunter who may or may not have drank a bottle of Luthors urine.Somewhere in between all this madness - and make no mistake very little here makes any sense even in the context of a movie about aliens and caped men battling over green space rocks - Snyder completely diminishes every female character who wanders along. While the why-so-serious men bulk up brood and bleed the women are either used as props (Luthors provocatively dressed wordless assistant) bargaining chips (Amy Adamss Lois Lane and Diane Lanes Martha Kent are both damsels in the worst kind of repeated distress) or Easter Eggs (Gal Godots Wonder Woman makes a hell of an entrance but is little more than a tease for her upcoming standalone movie).Just as with Watchmen Sucker Punch and 300 Snyder occassionally reminds the audience - and perhaps Time Warner shareholders - that he can be an inspired visual madman with a few shots so fantastically designed and staged that they could be freeze-framed and drooled over for hours. A cornfield-set funeral is washed out and hyper-realized that it goes past absurdity to become something close to high art. A visit to LexCorp headquarters is a trip into the extremes of millennial office-design fetishism. And a Bruce Wayne nightmare is a captivating blend of gritty dystopia wasteland and ultra-crisp colour palette.Yet that funeral scene is devoid of emotion. Luthors whole reason for existing in the film is dubious. And Batmans dream sequence is so poorly conceived (why is Batman wearing a trench coat atop his suit? Whats with the flying insects? Why was a dream envisioned from perspectives other than the person dreaming? Was that who I think it was during that message-from-the-future bit? If so why? Why???) to be laughable. The film might be pretty to look at but narratively speaking it is a disaster.Warner wants - no needs - you to latch on to BvS s versions of Superman Batman Wonder Woman and the rest of the Justice League if the studio is going to succeed in the marketplace. By the films end you should - no must - be giddy with anticipation of what big bad threat is lurking around the corner for these super friends. But theres no purpose for this aggressive world. Instead of letting Snyders justice dawn his vision should simply shuffle off into the twilight.

Warner Bros. Pictures Batman v Superman is a solid comic-book flick By Calvin Wilson St. Louis Post-Dispatch Calvin Wilson Mar 24 2016 (...) Clay Enos Henry Cavill in ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice."" Warner Bros. Pictures In his approach to fighting crime Batman (Ben Affleck) isnt particularly fond of restraint -- and that has Gotham Citys bad guys terrified. But the Caped Crusaders zeal in meting out justice has earned him a reputation as a vigilante and attracted the attention of a reporter who happens to have some issues of his own.Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) who works for the Daily Planet in Metropolis sees Batman not as a kindred spirit but as a dark reflection. As Superman Kent strives to do the right thing even in the most difficult of circumstances.But like Batman he must deal with public scrutiny -- particularly from Senator Finch (Holly Hunter) who questions whether the Man of Steel can be trusted to use his powers responsibly. His rescue of colleague and girlfriend Lois Lane (Amy Adams) from yet another tight spot appears to strengthen Finchs argument. Observing from the sidelines with manic glee is corrupt industrialist Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg channeling both Heath Ledgers take on the Joker and his own performance as Facebook mogul Mark Zuckerberg in ""The Social Network"").Luthor is the guy Finch should really be worried about. His nefarious strategy includes pitting the crime fighters against each other. ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice"" gets points just for finding a way to make a battle between the title characters credible. But the films impact is somewhat undercut by a loud and interminable heroes-versus-scary-monster sequence that cheapens all that had come before -- and sets up a late-coming plot twist thats likely to be met with considerable skepticism. Working from a screenplay by Chris Terrio (""Argo"") and David S. Goyer (""The Dark Knight Rises"") director Zack Snyder delivers a superhero epic thats a significant improvement on his work on its predecessor ""Man of Steel."" Thats due in large part to the controversially cast Affleck who brings not only physical but psychological heft to the Dark Knight and practically steals the film.As potential blockbusters go ""Batman v Superman"" is neither as stupid nor as stupendous as it might have been.What ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice""  THREE stars out of four  Run time 231  Rating PG-13  Content Intense violence and action sensuality Calvin Wilson  314-340-8346calvinwilsonstl on Twittercalvinwilsonpost-dispatch.com Can Batman v Superman give the Man of Steel an image makeover?

Entertainment) Whatever qualities it may lack Zack Snyders superhero blockbuster ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice"" -- which officially recalibrates the summer movie season into early spring -- does not lack texture. Thats not some fancy film-critic metaphor. If this movie is about anything (which is debatable) it is about materials and fabrics about the way they look and feel. This obsession became apparent in Snyders ponderous apocalyptic Superman picture ""Man of Steel"" where I was repeatedly distracted by the close-up shots of Supermans complicated synthetic-mesh costume. Both in this movie and that one Supermans alter ego Clark Kent (both played by the cartoonishly sculpted Henry Cavill) wears suspiciously nice and alarmingly tasteful suits considering that hes an oft-derided cub reporter for the Daily Planet. Where are the pleated Dockers we saw in ""Spotlight""?Its less surprising that Ben Afflecks Bruce Wayne dresses like the guy wearing a 10000 watch in a magazine ad. First of all Afflecks entire career has been about splitting the difference between that kind of simulated masculinity and the serious filmmaking craftsman whos not quite pretentious enough to call himself an artist. I dont know whether ""Batman v Superman"" is defined as a sequel or a reboot or an alternate-universe something-something; it could at a stretch be located in the same world as the Christopher Nolan-Christian Bale ""Dark Knight"" trilogy. Batman has moved from Gotham City to Metropolis -- which are like Dallas and Fort Worth or something? Council Bluffs and Omaha? -- and has been driven increasingly psychotic by the arrival of Superman godlike drone weapon from outer space.This movie isnt nearly as terrible as I was expecting largely due to Snyders OCD-level attention to the visual details. And yes due to Wonder Woman (played by Israeli actress Gal Gadot) who brings in a badly needed dose of ""Dragon Tattoo""-style female energy and whose emergence herein cant possibly be considered a spoiler at this point. But it still represents a subtle downgrade from the Nolan films on numerous levels imperfectly concealed by doses of steroids (and amazing fabrics).First of all Affleck is a major downgrade from Bale; I dont care what anyone says. Yeah I know people like him. Hes likable But during Afflecks serious scenes as Bruce Wayne he always looks to me like hes thinking ""Im acting my ass off Matts finally gonna see what I can do"" Whereas in his serious scenes as Batman using the growly Batman voice-box and wearing the clanky armored RoboBatsuit with built in arched eyebrows -- its even more homoerotic than the suit George Clooney wore in Joel Schumachers infamous 1997 ""Batman amp; Robin"" if such a thing is possible -- well Im sorry but there arent any because you cant really take him seriously.I have long been fascinated with Zack Snyder and Im willing to defend all his films up to a certain point. (Yes even ""Watchmen."" Even ""Sucker Punch"" Which I had forgotten I had described as ""the Nietzschean Superman of action movies."") Snyder is devoted to a mannered everything-on-the-surface style that is almost surrealist almost infused with Freudian themes and 20th-century politics and almost total bullshit. Im not as horrified as I should be I guess by this weeks news that Snyder is working on an adaptation of Ayn Rand magnum-bogus ""The Fountainhead."" Of course he is. Thats totally perfect. Its gonna be amazing with or without scare quotes. So Im kind of a Snyder defender and kind of a Nolan skeptic but thats me being an ass. In reality the former is unquestionably a downgrade from the latter in terms of cinematic technique pictorial sensibility action choreography thematic complexity and a bunch of other stuff. In short I like Snyder but he seems kinda dumb which is something no one has ever said about Chris Nolan.As I wrote on Tuesday it was deeply strange to go see ""Batman v Superman"" on the day of the Brussels attacks and walk out into a world that resembles Snyders paranoid fantasy universe way too much. This movie features a disastrous suicide bombing inside an iconic American institution exactly the sort of attack Donald Trump and Ted Cruz halfway wish would happen to justify their incoherent anti-Muslim policies. It features a proxy debate on the drone wars after Superman is accused of indiscriminately killing a bunch of African villagers while rescuing Lois Lane (Amy Adams) from some al-Shabab-style militant group. It features images of destruction in Belgium. (OK in the form of a black-and-white photo from World War I depicting an oddly attired Amazon warrior type.) It features politicians collectively crapping their drawers over immigration and terrorism epitomized by Holly Hunters enjoyable performance as a folksy but hardass Kentucky senator. (Shes supposed to be a Democrat which lets you know were in a different universe.) You Might Also Like But for all the obvious attempts made by screenwriters Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer to connect ""Batman v Superman"" to real-world 21st-century issues there is still way too much of the DC Comics universe that either cant be rethought (because its considered integral to the franchise) or simply isnt rethought. Do all Batman movies forever and ever have to be set in a steady-state version of 1989 where crime is unmanageably high large tracts of urban real estate are abandoned or decrepit and the cops are incompetent and corrupt bozos with bad sideburns? Theres definitely some psychological resonance to that scenario Many Americans appear to believe all sorts of apocalyptic and impossible things including that all big cities are like the worst parts of Detroit that violent crime is out of control and gay Muslim killers are flooding across the border and that since all social institutions have failed us the only answer is to prostrate ourselves before some messianic redeemer.Hell at least the beleaguered populace of greater MetroGotham has awesome options when it comes to selecting a fascist overlord. Out here in the real world weve got C-minus alien invaders A lizard-man with a bad combover who has never actually accomplished anything and an individual of unknown species who claims to be ""Canadian"" but may be the lead singer of Stryper. In the movie they have an actual super-being from another planet who is undeniably handsome (if youre an unimaginative 11-year-old girl) who saves children from burning buildings even if they happen to be Mexican and who claims Cincinnatus style that he doesnt want the job of ruling our planet. They also have a tormented sadistic crime-fighting billionaire who dresses up in kinky costumes and lives on an isolated island with his ""butler"" (an underwritten role for Jeremy Irons who is funny anyway). Seriously guys its 2016 Arent we beyond all this dissimulation and evasion these semi-closeted Frodo-and-Sam relationships between man and master? Except its 2016 by way of 1989 so I guess were not.Compared to the cardboard character of Superman and the pseudo-dark Batman -- well as I said earlier Gadots international slinkster role as socialite Diana Prince and her warrioress alter ego is an enormous breath of fresh air. But if I had to choose between those two guys Id still go with Jesse Eisenbergs Lex Luthor an awkward zillionaire in tennis shoes and obnoxious Brooklyn-hipster outfits. It wouldnt be fair to say that Eisenberg winks at the audience or undercuts the movie; one of the features of a Zack Snyder picture is that all possible winks are winked in advance and theres nothing left to undercut. But in playing Luthor as a more severely disabled Mark Zuckerberg from ""The Social Network"" Eisenberg at least makes himself into a locus of fun in a movie otherwise devoted to po-faced comics-geek earnestness. When Luthor stammers out his announcements that power is never innocent and these costumed buffoons are peddling delusions -- and by the way theres an open bar -- Im all like finally a hero to believe in. I couldnt even tell you whether the story of ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice"" makes sense and I dont suspect it matters. Batman and Superman are gonna fight Because theyre both jerks. Anderson Cooper and Nancy Grace and Neil deGrasse Tyson are super-concerned about this because it will affect the future of the human species and because ratings. (Somewhat respectable people have got to stop ""playing themselves"" in these shameless Hollywood spectacles. Its not funny or cool anymore and whatever it hypothetically does for their brand it makes me want to splatter vomit on their expensive loafers.) Then really really suddenly Batman and Superman decide to join forces because Lex Luthor has a secret weapon and oh wow except for the Wonder Woman stuff its really boring and predictable.So ""Batman v Superman"" is kind of dopey and plays out some laborious plot twists in the DC narrative at unnecessary length but as Ive already said it largely kept me entertained for two and a half hours which is not nothing. Snyders intense obsessive artificiality yields numerous striking images and the supporting cast around the leaden central duo of Affleck and Cavill (and the dancing electricity of Eisenberg) is excellent especially Irons Hunter Laurence Fishburne as the cantankerous editor of the Daily Planet and Scoot McNairy as a disabled and disgruntled Bruce Wayne employee who believes that corporate misdeeds demand public scrutiny. In the comic-book universe such an attitude is viewed as deeply uncool Who needs bureaucrats and congressional hearings when we have Batman Gosh arent we lucky to live in the real America where democracy holds the rich and powerful to account?

"Batman v. Superman Dawn of Justice | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice ) Batman v. Superman Dawn of Justice (United States 2016) March 23 2016 A movie review by James Berardinelli For those who thought Man of Steel was dark you aint seen nothing yet. Batman v Superman the battle royale/team-up of DC Comics revered superheroes is so bleak that the sun never seems to shine the characters faces cant form smiles and the whole affair is more depressing than fun. Theres little doubt that director Zack Snyder is trying to out-Nolan Christopher Nolan (who gets an Executive Producer credit) when it comes to leeching the light out of superheroes. Nolan however understood that the internal darkness needs to be a byproduct of careful character development and narrative thrust. Snyder has a more brute force approach - he doesnt allow for the possibility of brightness or traditional heroism. Batman v Superman revels in apocalyptic visuals death destruction mayhem and brutality. Despite the title theres no ""dawn"" in this movie. Its all ""dusk"" headed into a moonless starless night. To get to the conceit advertised by the title the narrative goes through some interesting contortions. Batman v Superman figures out a way to establish the superheroes as rivals rather than buddies. Each questions the others legitimacy. Batman (Ben Affleck) watched friends die as a result of Supermans battle with Zod in Man of Steel. Hes also concerned about the future possibility of Superman turning against his adopted planet.  Meanwhile Superman (Henry Cavill) sees the Dark Knight of Gotham as a dangerous vigilante. To even the playing field when these two square off Snyder introduces Kryptonite. With Superman diminished he and Batman can pound on each other for a while. Meanwhile supergenius Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) is up to no good although (thankfully) this time hes interested in more than a real estate scam. Snyder is a visual director and Batman v Superman it at its strongest during the special effects-laden action sequences. When it comes to character development however Snyder shows his Achilles heel. None of the familiar and in some cases iconic individuals in Batman v Superman come to life. Theyre avatars. Cavills Superman looks the part but wheres the heart? Its no coincidence that the actors performance as Clark Kent is unimpressive or that his chemistry with Amy Adams Lois Lane is nonexistent. Cavill is in this film for one reason his appearance. Put him in the suit and hes perfect. Yet one could argue that Christopher Reeve and Brandon Routh (both inferior actors to Cavill) did better jobs. Afflecks Batman is poorly served. Stripped of context and dropped unceremoniously in to a new universe the Caped Crusader comes across as a bitter man who parades around in a costume. Bruce Wayne is underdeveloped and Batman is just a guy in a bulletproof suit with a gravelly voice. The change of actor isnt the problem (Batman like James Bond is flexible enough to survive a lead switch). Instead its the stripping away of everything except the bare-bones origin. We dont know who this Batman is and the filmmakers are in such a rush to get Justice League out the door that they dont bother to establish a foundation for this iteration of the superhero. Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) is shoehorned in as an example of fan service. Her introduction and incorporation are awkward and artificial and she serves no real purpose beyond helping to jump start Justice League. She has no story no character and minimal background. Shes just there. Her presence more than any other narrative cue makes it clear that Snyder views this as bridging material between Man of Steel and Justice League. Amy Adams is unconvincing as Lois Lane. I thought she was miscast in Man of Steel and nothing in Batman v Superman has prompted a change of opinion. As a love interest for Superman/Clark she doesnt work and the script too often makes this supposedly strong independent woman into a damsel in distress. Newcomer Jeremy Irons isnt a good match for Alfred although the character is strangely portrayed - his constant disapproval of ""Master Bruce"" at times verges on contempt. Its not a comfortable or appealing relationship. On the other hand Jesse Eisenbergs Lex Luthor is a breath of fresh air. Gone is the bumbling semi-comedic version essayed by Gene Hackman and the Kevin Spaceys more sinister one. Since this vision of Luthor is as a psychotic Mark Zuckerberg who better to play him than the actor who did such a phenomenal job in The Social Network? Luthors endgame is obtuse but hes brilliant and unhinged and that makes for a great supervillain. Plus hes got Kryptonite. At 154 minutes Batman v Superman runs too long. After a rousing first 15 minutes that show the Man of Steel Superman/Zod fight from another perspective the film becomes a slog for the next half-hour as it introduces Batman and re-aligns Superman. Throughout theres too much reliance on dream sequences. Aspects of the films ending feel like a cheat and the movie misses an opportunity to do something powerful and radical opting instead for the predictable climax. Were reminded of how impermanent consequences are in most superhero movies. That wasnt the case in Christopher Nolans universe. It is the case here. Once Batman v Superman hits its stride most viewers will feel equal parts pummeled and immersed. Snyder is a master of the dark spectacle and he pours it on starting around the movies midpoint. Thematic overtures - such as the role of superheroes as protectors and whether they should be ""regulated"" - are lost in the dust and debris of Batman and Supermans smackdown. Still although viewers may be riveted at times the net experience isnt much fun. The Avengers and The Force Awakens (to name just two) have illustrated that its possible to have huge stakes without turning the movie into a relentless downer. Snyder wants his film to be seen as more than a disposable ""popcorn flick."" Its too bad the only way he can think to achieve that is by singeing the popcorn and depressing the audience. Batman v.

Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill in ""Batman v. Superman Dawn of Justice."" Movie review Batman v Superman is a super-sized bore Katie Walsh Tribune News Service Mar 23 2016 0 Warner Bros. Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill in ""Batman v. Superman Dawn of Justice."" Did you ever think youd long for the horrible puns and scenery chewing of the campy 90s Batman movies? For Keaton Kilmer or even Clooney to fill out the Batsuit? The former playground of Tim Burton was drained of joy by Christopher Nolan and now Zack Snyder has taken it upon himself to flog the desiccated husk of Batman into cinematic oblivion. In ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice"" he does it by stuffing Batman into the sequel of a Superman reboot. Thats just plain wrong.While ostensibly a Superman film Snyder doesnt give human butter sculpture Henry Cavill much to do here so it feels more like a Batman movie and this is the blandest version yet. Both characters are as exciting as oatmeal and while Ben Affleck isnt terrible as the Caped Crusader he just feels miscast his usual irascibility tamped down. Jesse Eisenberg is at least working a more exciting tonal range as Lex Luthor positioned here as a wunderkind venture capitalist/tech innovator who wants to disrupt Superman. Hes got his fingers in a few pies involving human trafficking and experimental weapons manufacturing and though neither of these subplots have any impact on the story Snyder spends a fair amount of time chasing them down. Lexs disdain for government regulations is embodied by his feud with Sen. June Finch (Holly Hunter) whose hearings stand in the way of his free import of kryptonite which he hopes to weaponize.The two-and-a-half-hour film is stuffed to the gills with plot but feels very short on actual story. Its so busy - but its clear that its all just a puppet show to distract from the lack of anything original or emotionally resonant. All of the scurrying from character to character seemingly at random is profoundly dull confounding and pointless. With a surplus of characters (including Amy Adams as Lois Lane aka Superman bait and Gal Gadot bringing Wonder Woman to glorious life) the story is ultimately about just a few things 1. What good is good? Who can be good? What is good? Got it? Good. 2. Fighting over a green rock. 3. Boys who love their mothers. Experimental weapons and Senate hearings and terrorism and encrypted hard drives filled with Justice League clues are totally arbitrary to the core tale.You might even wonder why Batman is fighting Superman. Lex Luthor tells them so but the film shows that Bruce Waynes business and employees were part of the collateral damage from the destruction and carnage that Superman wrought at the end of ""Man of Steel."" Linking the climatic events of the prior film to the introduction of the world of this one is the one thing that Snyder gets right even if it exploits the opportunity to wring out every drop of 9/11 imagery.The final bludgeoning act is just as tedious and terrible to look at as the first two hours. Snyder shoots everything too close to be easily discernible on a large IMAX screen and the action scenes are at once chaotic and totally meaningless. With the arrival of Doomsday an indestructible being prone to nuclear tantrums ""Batman v. Superman"" becomes Batman Superman and Wonder Woman vs. King Kong. Unfortunately by the time we get to this point its impossible to care.

"In Batman v Superman the only winner is Marvel. Slate Sign In Sign Up In Batman v Superman the Only Winner Is Marvel In Batman v Superman the Only Winner Is Marvel Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.March 23 2016 700 PM Why So Serious? Batman v Superman spends so much time teasing later installments that it forgets to have any fun. By Jonathan L. Fischer Still of Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill in Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice. Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. For critics and fans who snagged a seat at the advance screening this week the latest Superman movie came with an unusual preamble a video message from director Zack Snyder begging the audience not to post any spoilers on Twitter or Facebook. Hey fair enough. With a title so clunky and focus-grouped it might as well be written in Kryptonian Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice isnt merely a sequel to 2013s Man of Steel. Its an Event a blockbuster showdown between two iconic superheroes--and one of the most expensive marketing vehicles of all time a sense-numbing joy-bludgeoning soul-deadening 152-minute trailer designed to kick-start for DC Comics the kind of malignant obscenely lucrative superhero empire that Iron Man Captain America and the Avengers have gifted Marvel and Disney. Pace Snyder Batman v Superman isnt packed with spoilers so much as it is stuffed with teasers the kind of cameos and set pieces clearly designed to entice customers to pay to see the next three or four Justice League films not help them enjoy this one. It might be the most teaser-dense film ever made. Jonathan L. Fischer Jonathan L. Fischer is a Slate senior editor. To put it delicately this comics fan hated Batman v Superman with the fury of a thousand red-dwarf suns. Blunt humorless and baffling it collides the brutish directorial stamp of Zack Snyder (he of 300 and Watchmen fame) with the most shameless instincts of our latter-day superhero franchise bubble. It is worse than the widely detested Joel Schumacher Batman films including the one with bat nipples. It is probably worse than the never-filmed Superman movie starring Nicolas Cage would have been. If Christopher Reeve is spinning in his grave right now its not because Snyders film so egregiously ignores what might make a Superman film special (though it does) but because the throbbing Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL score is loud enough to rattle a buried corpse. Im a lifelong comic-book reader who is generally sympathetic to comic-book movies and even liked Man of Steel. Batman v Superman made me want to yell at the Justice League to get off my lawn. Advertisement The premise if it matters Eighteen months have passed since the 9/11-esque ending of Man of Steel in which two warring Kryptonians reduced much of Metropolis to rubble. (An early flashback in Batman v Superman replays that melee from human scale acknowledging but hardly allaying the criticism that superhero films have become stunningly casual about the mass destruction they depict.) The world doesnt know what to make of the Man of Tomorrow Is he a Jesus figure or a false God? Is he above the laws of man or its last defender? While concerned-looking officials fret over these questions--and while talking-head appearances by the likes of Neil deGrasse Tyson and Andrew Sullivan strain to lend these matters some gravity--a few people have made up their minds a late-career Batman (Ben Affleck wincing) who believes a superbeing so powerful and unaccountable cant possibly be trusted (or maybe hes just jealous) and megalomaniacal industrialist Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg Jesse Eisenberging) who for reasons he never articulates in fewer than 150 words wants to bring Superman to heel (and who does things delightfully like stuffing cherry Jolly Ranchers in senators mouths). Supermans alter ego Clark Kent meanwhile has settled into domesticity with Lois Lane although both sides of the man rendered blankly by Henry Cavill remain something of a cipher. (Which is too bad because Cavill has pulled off precisely the right kind of driven slightly hammy Boy Scout this movie wouldve benefitted from--but it was last summer in The Man From U.N.C.L.E.) The movies first hour is a plot salad. Someone is framing Superman for deadly atrocities. Someone named White Portuguese is up to well something giving Batman lots of reasons to look growly. Something fell into the Indian Ocean and Lex Luthor is trying to get an import license to bring it to Metropolis. And somehow all of this unfolds both rapidly--no scene seems to last more than 90 seconds--and painstakingly because writers Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer make these strands more tangled than a superhero cape in a jet engine. Let me fix that for them Lex Luthor is framing Superman. White Portuguese is his boat. It is bringing a hunk of Kryptonite which is poisonous to Superman to Metropolis. Luthor wants Batman and Superman to fight. Was that so hard? About that Batman He shoots bullets and disfigures criminals with a bat brand a depiction that (along with many of the films designs) is inspired by The Dark Knight Returns a 1986 comic-book miniseries in which writer Frank Miller portrayed the character as a graying neofascist a vigilante boiled down to his predictable extremes. That makes this take on the character the grimmest to ever appear in the movies and the result is largely a one-note failure--all bat and no man except for a series of bat dreams and bat hallucinations that while mostly irrelevant to the plot suggest a superhero who isnt just losing his fight but is losing his grip. But Affleck doesnt do much with what little Snyder and his team give him--which is mostly Mortal Kombat-worthy lines like ""Do you bleed? You will."" Still to say Afflecks brooding interpretation has little on say Michael Keatons or Christian Bales performances in the same role is kind of like saying E.T. the ride isnt as good as E.T. the movie. Different categories different aims. Top Comment This movie is getting absolutely eviscerated on Rotten Tomatoes. Its current score is 35%. Brutal. My favorite capsule reviews ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice is basically a dumpster fire.  More... Join In The aim here--other than setting up the sequels--is the fight which like the movie itself feels closest to bare-knuckle boxing blunt technique lots of thuds no grace. Its the centerpiece fans are apparently hungry for in droves. (The movie is already Fandangos top preselling superhero movie ever.) And it makes plain everything I cant stand perhaps heretically about Snyders aesthetic from the rafter-rattling soundtrack to the overuse of grit-flecked shaky cam to the way overuse of timeline ramping his favored style of slow motion (which makes everyone look like theyre made of really angry Silly Putty). When Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) finally arrives in costume--after the heroes have teamed up to fight something even moodier than Batman--the film announces it with a processed guitar riff Im pretty sure once appeared on a Staind album. If something exciting happened during any of it I missed it while looking at my moviegoing companion to roll my eyes. Batman v Superman should be the nail in the coffin of an entire industry strategy in which each superhero films primary job is to lay breadcrumbs leading toward the next one. But as anyone who watches these movies knows nothing stays dead for long. And yet while DC seems intent on casting its emerging franchise in the doomy oh-so-serious mold of Snyders films--count me out for Batman x Aquaman Crux of Vengeance--I cant fault its competitors insistence that a movie based on a comic book might still want to be you know fun. When the dust from the titular bout was finally settled (or was it?) I walked out of Superman v Batman with an old childhood rallying cry restored Make mine Marvel.

Close Join the conversation... With Robert Wilonsky Share This Story Share Discuss Meh SPOILER WARNING If you want to go into Batman v Superman and be surprised whenever possible dont read on. Since the publications of Action Comics No. 1 in June 1938 and Detective Comics No. 27 the following May DC Comics has published untold thousands of Superman and Batman titles every single one of which is stuffed into Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice turned up to 11 and smashed to smithereens. This isnt a movie; this isnt even an experience. Its nothing more than a messily assembled revisit of the most cynically told story in Superman canon (The Death of ...) and an Easter egg hunt for fanboys wholl squeal at dream sequences featuring The Flash astride his cosmic treadmill warning of the coming Crisis on Infinite Earths and the panoramic shot of the Omega symbol heralding the some-day arrival of Darkseid the baddest baddie in the DC universe. Batman and Superman fight of course; its easily the best five minutes of the movie. Problem is the other two and a half hours () which tease and ultimately waste Wonder Woman (Gal Godot who might be great but who knows) lay waste (again) to Metropolis (or maybe its Gotham City -- who can tell?) and turn Lex Luthor into a rambling petulant ADHD-afflicted brat who looks and sounds a lot like that other social-networking wunderkind Jesse Eisenberg once played. Deafening dumbed down and drab -- another Zack Snyder DC movie in other words. Snyders movies have three shades of color dark gray darker gray and fire. Batman v Superman certainly aims for epic and aspires to be meaningful. Countless characters ramble on and on and on and on about the responsibilities of gods and the fears of humans. Repeatedly were reminded Superman (Henry Cavill) is the outsider the other -- an ""illegal alien"" per the protesters placard outside Senate hearings who could destroy the planet with some heat vision.Batman (Ben Affleck) is the paranoiac with a point As soon as Superman showed up in Snyders Man of Steel most of Metropolis wound up in ruins and many of its citizens in cemeteries -- including those who worked in the toppled offices of Wayne Financial. And we see that fight between Superman and General Zod (Michael Shannon) replayed during the opening moments of Batman v Superman this time from Bruce Waynes ground-level perspective. Its a powerful sequence watching humans watch superhumans destroy everything theyve built.From there though the glum only grows while the plot fractures into a thousand shards until finally Doomsday arrives to destroy everything rebuilt in the 18 months that have passed since Man of Steel. Snyder unlike say Jon Favreau or Joss Whedon or James Gunn or the other Marvels doesnt really seem to like the ""comic"" part of comic books. To him its all metaphor and portent Sturm und Drang. In the words of The Joker in a far better Batman movie ""Why so serious?"" A scene from Frank Millers ""Dark Knight Returns"" might as well be a still from ""Batman v Superman."" That said Afflecks Batman is the closest weve seen on screen to Frank Millers nasty Dark Knight the aged and anguished crime-fighter who when he debuted 30 years ago reinvented the comic book and provided the template for Tim Burton and Chris Nolans big-screen renditions. Writer David S. Goyer and re-writer Chris Terrio (Afflecks Argo-to man) lift whole scenes from Millers 1986 comic book for Batman v Superman -- the fight sequences of course but also the parade of talking heads on small screens commenting on the action (here they range from Anderson Cooper to Neil deGrasse Tyson).Affleck is also pretty dyn-no-Bat-mite as Bruce Wayne the booziest Bats in a bunch of otherwise stiff cowls and droopy capes. Hes the billionaire playboy who keeps wine bottles on the bedside table and women in the bed; he looks like he smells three days into a hangover. Which makes sense Superman living across the bay in Metropolis is still the relative newcomer but Batmans mid-career at this point with 20 years under his utility belt. Wayne Manors already been reduced to charred ruins and based on the Robin costume behind glass in the Batcave the Boy Wonders already been slain by the Joker. In the words of Alfred (Jeremy Irons a highlight in a movie in desperate need of them) the butler now rendered mechanic and sidekick hes grown too old to die young.Which come to think of it is exactly how youll feel after sitting through Batman v Superman.BATMAN V SUPERMAN DAWN OF JUSTICE (C-)Directed by Zack Snyder.

(Ryan Faughnder) As directed by Zack Snyder the two-hour 33-minute ""Batman v Superman"" does go on too long and lingers more than it should as Snyders ""Man of Steel"" did before it on its climactic action set pieces.But the director a strong technician whose slam-bang emphatic occasionally operatic style seems made for comic book adaptations has been well-served by an adept script co-written by Chris Terrio (an Oscar winner for Ben Afflecks ""Argo"") and David S. Goyer which raises a number of interesting issues.Goyer wrote on all three of Christopher Nolans Batman films and the spirit of that trilogy (Nolan and his partner Emma Thomas are executive producers here) is the key to its success in the creation of a despairing decaying Batman (convincingly played by a committed Affleck) who is flailing for purpose after years on the job. Batman v Superman trailer Watch the trailer for ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice."" Watch the trailer for ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice."" See more videos In this ""Batman v Superman"" consciously refers back to the Caped Crusaders modern origins the 1986 appearance of Frank Millers somber and ominous graphic novel ""Batman The Dark Knight Returns"" which repositioned Bob Kanes 1939 creation as a contemporary figure of almost existential torment. Miller is the first person thanked in this films credits and that is not an accident.Terrio and Goyers script shrewdly places this figure in a suspicious world that resents the fact that no deed however good is without its collateral damage a world that casts a cynical eye even on pure-hearted heroes like Superman (Henry Cavill once again a model of modest strength).In this world the Man of Steel is considered an unwelcome alien occasionally greeted by signs reading ""This Is Our World Not Yours"" and ""Earth Belongs to Humans."" In this world obviously there are strong echoes of our own.One of ""Batman v Supermans"" deft notions is to position Gotham Batmans home base and Metropolis Supermans headquarters as two cities facing each other across a bay a comic book universe equivalent to Oakland and San Francisco. A few of the Caped Crusaders memorable on-screen performances. With a multi-focus plot that is filled with twists ""Batman v Superman"" begins with not one but two different flashbacks the first being the classic one of a young Bruce Wayne watching in horror as his loving parents are murdered by a criminal in front of his eyes.The second flashback references the end of ""Man of Steel"" with Superman fighting off the invading Kryptonian legions of Gen. Zod (played by Michael Shannon). But its seen from the vantage point of Batmans alter ego Bruce Wayne who watches helplessly from street level as an alien weapon slices through the Wayne Enterprises building in Metropolis like an intergalactic Vegomatic and cripples loyal employee Wallace Keefe (Scoot McNairy).The films present is 18 months after that attack with the world still getting used to Supermans seemingly unstoppable presence and a big hunk of his ancestral nemesis Kryptonite discovered in the Indian Ocean.What the world doesnt know is that Supermans alter ego is mild-mannered reporter Clark Kent perennially under the thumb of Daily Planet editor Perry White (Laurence Fishburne) and still very much in love with co-worker Lois Lane (Amy Adams) the only person who is in on his secret.When a rescue of Lois leads to some of that collateral damage Superman runs afoul of the U.S. Congress specifically Sen. Finch of Kentucky (a welcome Holly Hunter) who pointedly insists ""Were so caught up with what Superman can do no one has asked what he should do."" See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story Sharing the senators distaste is perennial Superman nemesis Lex Luthor here played by Jesse Eisenberg as a twitchy tech billionaire frustrated because hes not in control of the world and sure that it is not possible for someone to be both all powerful and all good.And then there is Bruce Wayne/Batman. With Wayne Manor now a crumbling wreck he can be found in a Mies van der Rohe-ish lake house still attended by the loyal Alfred (Jeremy Irons) who waspishly reminds him hes ""too old to die young.""Decades of fighting crime have left Wayne discouraged and grizzled (cant a man this wealthy afford a decent shave?) and turned him into the kind of vigilante that straight-arrow Clark Kent finds abhorrent. And Wayne for his part still broods about all that Superman-related damage. And so it begins.The two men or at least their alter egos first come face to face at a glitzy party thrown by the conniving Lex. There Wayne meets the alluring Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) a mysterious presence who means it when she tells him ""I dont think youve ever known another woman like me.""Well be hearing more from Diana Prince later and from lots of other folks as well as Warner Bros. is deeply involved with a whole series of movies based on the DC Comics universe. While the Marvel universe now owned by Disney is glib and sunny its a nice echo of Warners past as a home to gangsters and gritty melodramas to find its DC world operating very much on the dark end of the street.------------Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice MPAA rating PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action throughout and some sensualityRunning time 2 hours 33 minutes Playing In general releasekenneth.turanlatimes.comMOREFULL COVERAGE Batman v SupermanBen Affleck Henry Cavill and Zack Snyder talk superhero smack downGal Gadot feels so good playing Wonder Woman thanks to her daughters princess obsession Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times A version of this article appeared in print on March 24 2016 in the Entertainment section of the Los Angeles Times with the headline ""Superhero showdown - `Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice revels in its dark new world - MOVIE REVIEW"" -- Todays paperTodays paper | Subscribe Entertainment Movies Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice Ben Affleck Zack Snyder Reviews Man of Steel Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined TV viewership for Hillary Clintons acceptance speech is smaller than Donald Trumps Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad78deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-batman-superman-review-20160325-column.html,200,batman16,batman,latimes
"Review Batman v Superman a spectacular idea with mixed results - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Batman v Superman a spectacular idea with mixed resultsBy Tony Hicks thicksbayreanewsgroup.comPosted 03/23/2016 120852 PM PDTUpdated 03/23/2016 043059 PM PDT Related StoriesMar 23Batman v Superman 5 things to know about Wonder Woman Gal GadotBatman versus Superman Who has the advantage?Mar 21Ben Affleck worked hard at Batman to prove haters wrongBatman needs a vacation. Superman needs some seasoning.Lex Luthor needs less caffeine.Wonder Woman needs more screen time (and shes going to get it soon). Those issues aside Zack Snyder managed to squeeze a lot into ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice."" Maybe a bit too much. He doesnt always succeed in pulling all the competing elements together but its undeniably thrilling to see the most iconic comic book heroes of the 20th century battle it out amid a flurry of dazzling special effects and chest-thumping violence.There was no easy way to make this movie considering the history of its main characters. Plus Snyder had to deal with the fact that rival Marvel and its Avengers universe has gotten off to such a big head start -- chronologically and stylistically -- on DC and its Justice League. So DC and Snyder jammed a lot into ""Batman v Superman"" to get back into the game. And it often works. Maybe it is unfair to Ben Affleck that his new Batman comes while visions of Christian Bale still haunt our memories. That said he mostly pulls it off. Most of the flaws in the role are circumstantial -- he wasnt allowed to do much more than be angry and/or brooding (if we have to watch Bruce Waynes parents die again can we at least get the condensed version? We get it. He has issues).Henry Cavills version of Superman seemed a bit more comfortable this time as his character was given more depth in questioning his role on Earth. However I would have liked to see him develop as a character in one more stand-alone movie before DC threw him into the superhero WrestleMania. This time Snyder at least allows Clark Kent and Lois Lane (Amy Adams) to have a relationship.Advertisement Given a huge challenge Snyder drops the gloves and tries going big with mixed results. ""Batman v Superman"" is a dense occasionally repetitive long almost humorless (about one chuckle per 50 minutes) film that doesnt thoroughly explain various subplots while dwelling too long on others. It needed more heart and fewer ominous overtones of men in capes grappling with their pasts. Ironically the couple of laughs we get are really well set up by the morose mood. Synder should have gone to the fun well a few more times.And we do have the terrific premise Do the benefits of Superman outweigh the damage he causes and omnipotent power he represents (echoing a familiar theme in the U.S. since 9/11). Snyder revisits the final battle of 2013s ""Man of Steel"" during which Superman and General Zod lay waste to much of Metropolis including a building full of Bruce Waynes employees. What we didnt see then was Wayne arriving in time to witness the real human cost on the ground. Wayne comes to believe we cant trust an alien wielding the power to destroy Earth. In return Superman/Clark Kent thinks Batman is a dangerous sadistic vigilante.Superman is also under fire from Congress over his tendency to be a bull in a china shop. Of course gunning for him as well is Lex Luthor who becomes the films de facto answer for unexplained circumstances. Jesse Eisenbergs Luthor is problematic. Hes not the calculating subtly threatening occasionally gentlemanly villain of old. Eisenberg goes for twitchy sociopathic freak -- a poor-mans version of The Joker. In previous incarnations Luthor usually had at least somewhat logical reasons to hate and fixate on Superman. This time Luthor seems nothing more than what happens when you mix crazy smart and rich.Orbiting around all this convolution is the mysterious breath of fresh air Diana Prince/Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) who steals every scene shes in. Her unveiling as Wonder Woman is one of the films best moments and like someone coming off the bench to energize a team she ramps up everyone elses game. She joins Batman and Superman in taking on Luthors conveniently created giant mountain of rage Doomsday. At this point asking for details is pointless. You just take the ride.But dont get the idea the ride isnt awesome at times. The final climactic battle scene is epic -- as are the two big noisy conflicts before it (yes Superman and Batman trying to kill each other really does live up to expectations).Snyder ends the film with what would have been a strong point had the movie ended 10 minutes earlier. The films last microseconds made me wince as did Bruce Waynes generic ""we have to band together and be vigilant"" declaration against an enemy that isnt even there yet. Obviously theyll find one in time for the Justice League movie DC is slated to release next year.Contact Tony Hicks at Facebook.com/BayAreaNewsGroup.TonyHicks or Twitter.com/tonyhicks67Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice    Rating PG-13 (for intense sequences of violence and action throughout and some sensuality)Cast Ben Affleck Henry Cavill Jesse Eisenberg Amy Adams Gal Gadot Diane Lane Laurence Fishburne Director Zack SnyderRunning time 2 hours 31 minutesOpens In wide release March 25Print Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Review Holocaust haunts family in The GatheringReview In Hearts of Palm bumbling corporation aims to plunder paradiseReview In Bad Moms fast food and booze spike the stress of motherhood Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

Running 153 minutes with a swollen budget of 250 million ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice"" is pure overpriced overproduced overlong pulp. It is an interesting idea of a film created by people who have no earthly idea how to do it a quasi-epic without a thimbleful of wit style or rooting interest in either of its leads. The respected Christopher Nolan is one of the producers but this film is to his ""Dark Knight"" trilogy what a black velvet Elvis is to the Mona Lisa. This dour dead-on-arrival film throws the feel-good glory days of American comic books on a funeral pyre. It is largely a follow-up to director Zack Snyders 2013 smashfest ""Man of Steel"" and you need a will of steel and a strong stomach to sit through it. The earlier film was a savage Superman demolition derby that left many fans pained by its illogical and repulsively grim body count. This rehash and reheat installment aims to clear up those unresolved issues with an even higher tally of fatalities. It also introduces Batman as his adversary and name-checks several other superfolk scheduled to quickly have their own films. All of it is offered up with feverish seriousness. If you wonder whats meant by the phrase ""deadly dull"" this is it. Hunky shallow Henry Cavill emerges as the Taylor Kitsch of the moment. He returns as the red-caped alien caroming across Metropolis and Gotham City (here set closer side by side than Minneapolis and St. Paul) in mighty leaps and bounds. Hes the sort of good guy who liquefies bad guys with laser beams from his eyes. Ben Affleck steps into the midnight black uniform of Batman his chin resembling a cinder block beneath his mask. The actor delivers a concrete performance as Bruce Wayne a vigilante billionaire so battle-weary that he retains a perpetual three-day stubble. Each despises the other as a threat to humanity and Snyder who has a knack for violence expends vast amounts of computer generated chaos and slow-motion acrobatics to drive home the point. Clay Enos Warner Bros. Ben Affleck stars as Batman left and Henry Cavill as Superman in ""Batman V. Superman Dawn Of Justice."" The opening of the film returns us to Supermans city-shattering battle in the previous film explicitly resonating to the 9/11 terror attacks on Manhattan. It rushes to horror film scenes of Batman torturing criminals and sending them to prisons where their branding iron bat tattoos are a death sentence among other evildoers. The stars launch overheated sadomasochistic duels again and again before jointly facing a computer-generated alien warrior who literally disembowels his victims just in case you skipped anatomy class. Gal Gadot joins the brawl as Wonder Woman with a smirky ""Im just warming up"" expression. Amy Adams return as Lois Lane gives the film a rare nod to humanity. Jeremy Irons acts ever so adroitly as Batmans butler Alfred. And Jesse Eisenberg is resourcefully artificial playing tech wizard Lex Luthor as a budding lunatic. Its not all terrible. The real villains here seem to be director Snyder who believes that no duke-out is worth filming unless it runs 50 rounds and the MPAA ratings board recommending this assaultive film to children with a PG-13. colincovert ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Ann Hornaday March 23 Follow AnnHornaday Zack Snyders ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice"" is in theaters March 25. (  / Warner Bros.) ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice"" begins and ends with a funeral which is fitting for a movie that plays like one long dirge. Dreary overproduced and underbaked this nominal showdown between two of comic-doms most mythic superheroes serves as a grim reminder of just how bad ""Man of Steel"" really was. That 2013 movie introduced British actor Henry Cavill as Superman in a tea-colored miasma of dutiful action sequences and sadistically over-the-top violence. Director Zack Snyder returns to those questionable core values in a film that replaces genuine intrigue and suspense with a series of confounding red herrings tossing out solemn observations about men gods martyrs and saviors while invoking such hot-button issues as terrorism drones and immigration. ""Batman v Superman"" is so desperate for the audience to take it seriously that it forgets to have any fun at all Rather than escapism and sensory exhilaration viewers get down in the mire with protagonists who grimace scowl and wince their way through heroics with the joyless determination of shift workers making the doughnuts. [Man of Steel Henry Cavill stars as Superman in this bombastic reboot] Ben Affleck stars as Batman and Henry Cavill stars as Superman in Zack Snyders ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice."" (Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures) ""Batman v Superman"" begins where ""Man of Steel"" left off -- that is with Superman laying waste to the futuristic city of Metropolis in order to save it. Appalled millionaire orphan Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) worries that the new neighborhood vigilante is accountable to no one -- unlike Bruce who at least has to answer to his lifelong factotum Alfred (a drolly amusing Jeremy Irons). The point of ""Superman v Batman"" of course is to get these two brooding saviors of humanity to the ultimate showdown and maybe launch an ""Avengers""-worthy multiverse in the bargain. Snyder with the dubious help of screenwriters Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer does all he can to put off that final confrontation keeping Bruce and Clark Kent on their separate paths only to be brought together by the unhinged entrepreneur Lex Luthor portrayed by Jesse Eisenberg in a jittery hysterically pitched performance that resembles a gnat impersonating Heath Ledger. [Batman vs. Superman Who really has the advantage?] Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne. (Clay Enos/Warner Bros. Pictures) Henry Cavill as Clark Kent. (Clay Enos/Warner Bros. Pictures) Eisenberg is one of the few weak links in the cast of ""Batman v Superman"" which actually features some terrific performances Affleck has the square jaw and resolute demeanor to convincingly channel Bruce who once he becomes Batman acquires an adenoidal speaking voice and a pair of Frankensteinian shoes that if camera placement is any indication Snyder has a fetishistic fascination with. As Superman Cavill once again wears that vaguely put-off expression of someone whos just ingested something distasteful; hes much more appealing as Clark Kent for a Warby Parker age doting on Lois Lane (Amy Adams) and wondering why his valiant efforts to save the world are seen by some as the suspect doings of an alien arriviste. Suffused with paranoia and hostility ""Batman v Superman"" engages in the kind of po-faced hyper-masculinity that can be seen as an apologia for privilege at its most unexamined and disarming Sure these guys swagger through the streets laying waste to all thats in their path but their psychic burdens are unimaginable. They hurt. (And man do they love their mothers.) [Wait why are Batman and Superman fighting? Your Dawn of Justice primer] As a wish-fulfillment fantasy of potency and unassailable moral certainty Snyders vision is understandable if not particularly distinguished or convincing. Chase scenes explosions beat-downs shootouts and the final brutalizing mano-a-mano all look cobbled together from generic elements of other movies crashing into a rock em sock em rubble of glass steel rain and polystyrene concrete. (Hans Zimmers bombastically self-important score is just as derivative in this case of all his other bombastically self-important scores.) An early callback to the fall of the World Trade Center on 9/11 manages to be both painfully timely and shamelessly opportunistic. Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. (Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures) At a punishing two and a half hours its all very turgid and unsmilingly sober -- the direct opposite of the sprightly witty visually vibrant ""Avengers"" movies -- but there are bright spots. Holly Hunter brings flinty brio to her role as a U.S. senator skeptical of Supermans motives. And Gal Gadot exudes both mystery and muscle as Wonder Woman who shows up way too late to do way too little. (The same could be said for Diane Lane here cast as Clarks Midwestern mom even though she has enough glamour and moxie to embody a superhero in her own right.) [How Batman vs. Superman represents the age-old battle between man and god] Strip away the trite character beats rote plot points random dream sequences and other narrative padding and ""Batman v Superman"" comes down to the actors their characters and whether they can sustain interest over the long haul. The answer is yes if they wind up in the hands of filmmakers blessed with authentic imagination rather than serviceable technical chops. Seen through one lens ""Batman v Superman"" embodies the exhaustion of a genre that has long since outlived the ability to invest it with new relevance and meaning. Seen through another it suggests that the slate is always blank waiting to be re-inscribed or better yet smashed altogether. We can always use another hero. In the meantime our heroes desperately need new life -- not another dirge. PG-13. At area theaters. Contains intense sequences of violence and action throughout and some sensuality. 157 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

In a few more overblown overstuffed repetitive bombastic and sometimes just dumb. (Never mind dreary to look at and punishing to hear.) Zack Snyder follows his Superman reboot Man of Steel with a muddled meditation on mans anxiety about God walking the earth. Except of course hes not God Superman (Henry Cavill) demands no sacrifice no worship and no authority over humanity. He just wants to help out and have bathtub sex with his girlfriend Lois Lane (Amy Adams). After all the love of a good woman worked for Dad But who knows? The Man from Krypton might go bad someday which is more than twitchy evil genius Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) can tolerate seeing as how his father grew up under the boot in East Germany. Bruce Waynes (Ben Affleck) father meanwhile taught him that the world only makes sense if you force it to. So he became Batman to do just that and theres no room for God in his philosophy. Lex and Bruce both decide that Superman has to go but while Batman chooses a single chemical-based plan of attack Luthor goes for a hat-trick firing up his anti-God propaganda machine while also doing a little God-play of his own. Tired yet? Too bad Theres also a bunch of sequel-bait involving ""meta-humans"" a whole bunch of speechifying (Jeremy Irons as Alfred the butler gets the best of it here) and a long simmering appearance from Wonder Woman that adds precisely nothing to the proceedings. Theres more too so much more that the strangest aspect of the film is the lingering feeling that along the way some important bits got left out. 2016. -- Matthew Lickona Related links ""Batman v.

(Courtesy of Warner Bros. Picture/Courtesy of Warner Bros. Picture) Movie review of ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice"" An unrelieved atmosphere of oppressiveness makes ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice"" a joyless slog. Rating 1.5 stars out of 4. Share story By Soren AndersenSeattle Times movie reviewer They should have left well enough alone. Its only been four years since Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale wrapped up what now seems likely to be long remembered as the definitive Batman movie trilogy of ""Batman Begins"" ""The Dark Knight"" and ""The Dark Knight Rises."" But the desire of Warner Bros. to counter the massive and growing dominance of Marvel in the realm of superhero moviemaking has brought forth ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice"" a picture specifically engineered to launch a profusion of DC-comics-derived costumed crime-fighter franchises. Movie Review 1/2   Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice"" with Ben Affleck Henry Cavill Amy Adams Jesse Eisenberg Gal Gadot. Directed by Zack Snyder from a screenplay by Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer. 151 minutes. Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action throughout and some sensuality. Several theaters. Well good luck with that.

VIEWMicrosoft says its planning to lay off 2850 by end of fiscal yearUnlimited Digital Access. 1 for 4 weeks.The powers that be at Warner gave director Zack Snyder (""Man of Steel"" ""300"") a budget of 250 million according to published reports and what he has given in return is a movie that treats the audience as an enemy a victim. For starters Snyder wields the bombastic drum-heavy orchestral score like a sledgehammer as if trying to batter the audience into submission with sonic overkill. Its a murky-looking picture filled with scenes of high-decibel violence that climaxes in a protracted slugfest between the two superheroes then segues into a seemingly longer and even more brutal special-effects-filled battle with one of the ugliest monsters ever seen on the big screen. Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) puts in a brief appearance during this fight setting the stage for her own movie due out next year. The motivation for the titular conflict arises from the desire of Batman to punish Superman for the terrible destruction wrought on Metropolis by Supes battle with Gen. Zod at the end of 2013s ""Man of Steel"" which was Snyders first foray into the world of Superman. Thousands died in that epic battle. The level of carnage enrages Batman to the point of vengeance and psychosis. The citizens of Metropolis are none too pleased with that outcome either and ""Batman v Superman"" expands on the theme central to ""Man of Steel"" that Superman the alien from another planet is a creature to be distrusted and eventually loathed. Goading the two into a fighting frame of mind is scheming business mogul/evil genius Lex Luthor played by Jesse Eisenberg with a peculiar jitteriness and a full head of hair a strange departure from a character whose most defining feature in the comics is baldness. As Batman Ben Affleck glowers and rasps and looks downright doleful all the time. Though Batman has never been a load of laughs Affleck seems to have decided to try to out-angst Bale in his portrayal. Missing in action is any sense of the characters humanity. Henry Cavill returns to the role of Superman which he first played in ""Man of Steel"" the box-office hit that opened the way for Snyder to be given the keys to ""Batman v Superman."" Hes another pained stone face but at least his character isnt a psycho. Neither is he particularly sympathetic. Many decisions -- the miscasting of Affleck and Eisenberg such misguided rejiggerings of classic story elements as making Alfred (Jeremy Irons) less of a butler and more of a stubbly electronics expert who keeps the Bat gizmos running right the decision to de-emphasize those cool gizmos (sparingly seen are the Batmobile and the Batwing) along with an unrelieved atmosphere of oppressiveness -- make ""Batman v Superman"" a joyless slog.

Share Tweet As any 10-year-old comics nut can attest pitting the biggest household names in superheroism against each other has never made much logical sense; being the worlds greatest detective doesnt count for much in a fistfight with someone faster than a speeding bullet and more powerful than a locomotive. No the showdown only works if you consider what these iconic characters the shining stars of the DC Comics stable really represent Theyre the perfect inverse of each other a beaming beacon of mankinds promise going toe-to-toe with the dank underbelly of its fears. And thats where Batman V Superman Dawn Of Justice first runs into trouble. When the Last Son Of Krypton seems every bit as anguished as edgily dark as the Dark Knight himself whats the point in bashing them together? Their conflict isnt so much ""day versus night"" to quote the bad guy as ""late evening versus slightly later evening.""Directed by Zack Snyder of faithfully butchered Watchmen fame Batman V Superman takes a title fight kids of all ages have been speculating about for decades--costumed titan from the cosmos meet costumed vigilante from the city--and invests it with all the fun of a protracted custody battle. Its a direct sequel to Snyders equally dour Man Of Steel meaning that were stuck with the same off-putting Superman (Henry Cavill) who leveled Metropolis snapped the neck of his enemy and basically made out with his sweetheart on ground zero. (Its hard to learn the value of human life when your late foster father moral compass of the previous movie suggests that protecting your secret identity may be more important than saving a busload of drowning children.) Not to be outdone BvS mangles the principles of its new principal Here we have a Batman (Ben Affleck) with a slightly more flexible stance on guns and murder; hes introduced literally branding his insignia on a sex trafficker--a mark were told that will get the criminal killed in prison.Why are the worlds finest clawing at each others capes and cowls? The smartest move made by returning screenwriter David S. Goyer and new ringer Chris Terrio (Argo) is building the movie around the collateral damage of Man Of Steels climax restaged from the ground-level perspective of Gothams playboy with a secret Bruce Wayne. While the world debates how to sanction the god that can turn their cities to rubble in the kind of senate hearings that superhero movies now use to situate their scenarios in ""reality"" an angrier-than-usual Batman stews about his alien rivals dangerous power. Of course it takes a nudge to get these two to real blows and that comes from the films cokehead millennial version of Lex Luthor (a jittery babbling Jesse Eisenberg apparently determined to out-ham both Gene Hackman and Kevin Spacey).Running the length of about seven Batman The Animated Series episodes Batman V Superman choppily races through plot as the film works in a CIA coverup a discovered lump of Kryptonite a downed UFO the body of Michael Shannons slain General Zod glib echoes of real-world terrorism and a second villain whose identity shouldnt be disclosed. Relationships have no room to blossom or even reveal themselves. Whats it like one must wonder to date a being from beyond the stars? The New Adventures Of Lois amp; Clark spent four seasons answering that question while Batman V Superman can barely spare the single scene necessary to explain that Kal-El (a.k.a. Superman a.k.a. Clark Kent) is now living with Lois Lane (Amy Adams) who the film keeps sending on strictly expository Daily Planet assignments. Far too much time has to be reserved for laying Justice League groundwork including shoehorned appearances by ageless Amazonian and future team player Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot).In Dawn Of Justice Supes and the Bat arent so different Theyre both moody dudes with responsibility complexes anxiety about their legacies and--in what becomes an amusingly pivotal plot point--mothers named Martha. Theyre also both epic bores. As played again by Cavill who has the squared-jawed look but not the heroic touch Superman comes across like a smugly sociopathic deity Faced with his chilly blank arrogance one cant help but long for the charismatic decency of a Christopher Reeve (or even the more puppyish charm of one-timer Brandon Routh). Affleck meanwhile broods and simmers but does little new with the dual rich-boy/crime-fighter role possibly because the movie counts on audiences being so familiar with the Bat mythos that it doesnt need to fill in either his interior or exterior lives--beyond of course the umpteenth flashback to the Wayne family getting gunned down in the gutter.This is an airless and humorless superhero movie but its never an anonymous one. Much more so than the Batman films of Christopher Nolan from which Snyder borrows a self-seriousness but not a sense of propulsive excitement Dawn Of Justice aims for some of the exaggerated visual grandeur of actual comics Our heroes look like Greek gods towering and massive with Superman descending from the heavens (and out of an Alex Ross painting perhaps) while Batman basically gets to slip on the boxy heavy armor he sported in Frank Millers seminal dystopian miniseries The Dark Knight Returns. There are striking images most notably in a whacked-out dream sequence (one of many actually) that feels like a lost passage from Snyders juvenile-pastiche passion project Sucker Punch. Just as often the director proves himself woefully incapable of staging the kind of big-bang spectacle his material demands. The films interminable final act for example is an eyesore of CGI combat the kind of weightless machismo rock-scored digital spectacle that the filmmaker previously mined from Millers rah-rah Spartan war saga 300.What Snyder sees in these timeless characters is raw herculean power and little else; he pushes them closer to abstract icons of fascist supremacy than theyve possibly ever been pushed either paying lip service to or outright ignoring the values theyve always stood for. Which frankly isnt the end of the world We can have a scarily remote Superman and a borderline-alcoholic Batman just as we can now have a Gotham (never properly established as nothing in this film is) that apparently lies just across the bay from Metropolis. But shouldnt all this geeky property colliding still at least be entertaining? Shouldnt it play to the cheap seats instead of wallowing in the murk? To enjoy Batman V Superman a blockbuster somehow more boring than it is strange is to cling for dear life to brief flashes of levity and lunacy--and the most reliable source of both is Eisenbergs nervous motormouth of a supervillain granted pages of halting monologue and a musical theme much more playful than the film containing it. The actors having fun. At least someone is.For thoughts on and a place to discuss plot details we cant reveal in this review visit Batman V Super Dawn Of Justices spoiler space.

Comments (1) click to enlarge Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice 3D Video Rated PG-13  151 minutes  2016 Not as bad as Bush v. Gore but close. Director Zack Snyder having revived the Superman franchise with Man of Steel (2013) tosses in the Caped Crusader (Ben Affleck) rehashes his origin story yet again (his parents being gunned down in Gotham his mothers pearls scattering) and sets him up as Supermans antagonist. Affleck makes a pretty good Batman (hes got great teeth) though his insight into the character consists mainly of having him hit the streets in a one-day stubble and a crabby mood. Jesse Eisenberg contributes arch line readings as Lex Luthor and Jeremy Irons adds the requisite touch of fake class as Alfred the butler. This is being billed as the second installment in a DC Comics ""extended universe"" franchise with two more sequels to follow and also spin-off features for Wonder Woman Aquaman and the Flash (all of whom appear here). When the DC Universe goes to war with the Marvel Universe well know the end times have arrived. With Amy Adams and Diane Lane. By J.R. Jones See our full review Batman v.

By David Edelstein most people will leave feeling drained and depressed wondering how a studio can get away with withholding so much for the sake of future profits before audiences start to rebel. 677 Shares Share 669 Tweet 0 Share 4 Share Email Print Share Photo Warner Brothers With Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice the movie division of DC Entertainment and the parent studio Warner Bros. have given the fanboys and the Nolanoids what they crave a and lo it is impressive and lo it is godawful. Those arenat mutually exclusive. The imagery is mythic otherworldly a further step away from the color-popping panels of illustrator Brian Bolland (The Killing Joke) and toward the dense doominess of Frank Miller the man-machine sci-fi fusions of H.R. Giger and the Biblical hell of William Blake. The movie is no slouch in the content department either. Director Zack Snyder (working from a screenplay by Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer) has set out to deliver a tortured disquisition on societyas various (imperfect) choices for keeping us safe in the wake of 9/11 here represented as the invasion of aKryptoniansa that killed thousands of Metropolis citizens at the close of Snyderas Man of Steel (2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne has a like so many previously sane individuals following 9/11 a gone over to the Dick Cheney-esque adark sidea while Superman/Clark Kent a an anguished alien with Christ-like underpinnings a wrestles with how and when to intervene in mankindas crises constantly undermined by a Congress questioning his aunilaterala powers. Wealthy Lex Luthor is the catalyst for catastrophe. So Bats and Supey fight and stuff blows up real good. Its a shame that Batman v Superman is also a storytelling disgrace. It has maybe six opening scenes and jumps so incessantly from subplot to subplot that a script doctor would diagnose a peculiarly modern infection ""disjunctivitis."" Said infection is the upshot of a sort of gene-splicing. For a studio to move beyond the ""franchise"" and ""tentpole"" stages to the vastly lucrative ""universe"" a comic-book movie must at every turn gesture towards sequels and spinoffs teasing out loose ends cultivating irresolution. The movie wanders into so many irrelevant byways that it comes to seem abstract. Theres enough going on to keep you watching -- and as I said to keep fanboys wowed by the scale of the production and pretension. But most people will leave feeling drained and depressed wondering how a studio can get away with withholding so much. A How is Ben Affleck? Weighty. Hes not your fathers Batman -- even the mask now resembles the face of an especially sour gargoyle and instead of dropping his voice an octave like Christian Bale he has a mechanism for altering it. If thats to hide his identity it seems pointless The bat-mask covers neither the mole on Afflecks right cheek nor his distinctive dimpled chin so its even more beyond belief that the mayor police chief and rest of Gotham City wouldnt know that Bruce Wayne is Batman. But were past all that Adam West juvenilia. Everyone seems to take for granted that Batman is Bruce Wayne (and for that matter that Clark -- with Henry Cavills even cleftier chin -- is Superman). Were in the realm of ideas people -- and near as I can tell ones somewhat similar to the upcoming Captain America picture Civil War which is evidently a battle royale over civil liberties with Captain America as Superman and Iron Man as Batman. The idea here is that Bruce Wayne witnesses firsthand (in a prologue) the partial destruction of Metropolis and the death of loved ones and blames not General Zod but ""that sonovabitch"" Superman who ""brought the war to us."" A sign in front of Congress calling Superman an ""illegal alien"" gibes pretty well with Batsos view. He tells Alfred (Jeremy Irons) that even a one percent chance of another major attack justifies extra-legal tactics -- a naked restatement of Cheney and the neocons famous ""one percent doctrine."" Alfred by the way is now the Chloe to Batsos Jack Bauer manning the monitors in the Batcave while making withering cracks about Bruces drift to the far right. Were a long way from when the butler actually buttled. Cavills Supey is hardly a bright counterpoint being the guiltiest savior imaginable Every saintly tableau in which he rescues innocents is offset by a Southern senator (Holly Hunter) calling for hearings to put some checks and balances on the aliens power. (Most of Metropoliss sheeple seem to like Superman though one woman complains that ""he answers to no one not even to God."") The parents are no help Clarks mom (Diane Lane) tells her suffering son that he has no obligation to the world while the ghost of his dad (Kevin Costner) shows up in a vision to imply that Clark has a duty to fight for those who suffer. Lois Lane (Amy Adams) insists that the Man of Steel ""gives people hope"" but wonders whether her sexual relationship with him is a distraction Must he give up love? There are also cameos by the likes of Charlie Rose Anderson Cooper Soledad OBrien Nancy Grace and Neil deGrasse Tyson who play themselves interviewing fictional characters and/or holding forth on the meaning of superheroes. You cant accuse Batman v Superman of lacking multiple points of view. The most bizarre perspective comes from Jesse Eisenbergs Lex Luthor who waves his arms and -- in manic Aspergian fashion -- cant seem to meet anyones eyes. Eisenberg is ham with a side of ham a blend of the Joker and his Mark Zuckerberg but I liked his energy. He makes a choice and goes with it at one point letting loose with a patented supervillain falsetto giggle. Amassing kryptonite to be used against the Man of Steel Luthor goads the surprisingly dim Batso into taking on Superman and then announces the fight like a demented ring announcer -- ""God versus man ... son of Krypton versus bat of Gotham"" etc. You would think that Superman should be able to take care of Batman with one mighty punch but this paramilitary Armored Crusader is so souped-up that he can take being hurled through walls with no apparent ill effects. Then again bodies in these superhero movies seem to be infinitely regenerative which means a lot of deafening crashes to no particular end. When a near-indestructible Kryptonian super-ogre arrives the fighting is even more intense and more inconsequential -- apart from the impact on poor Gotham City which gets its own 9/11. Its a howler when mother-love factors into the resolution but hey that love is the greatest superpower of all am I right? Lust is the second greatest. You know from the trailers that Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) shows up having previously loitered in the margins of the movie. The good advance word on Gadot has centered on her wowza appearance but she preens more than acts. Her best moments come when she laughs out loud in the middle of fighting. This dour bombastic movie needed an infusion of joy. Many scenes in Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice work on their own terms and Snyder has a gift for visual poetry. But he never gets to the heart of that all-important civil liberties question not because the question is unresolvable but because there can be no true endings in this superhero universe. The problem is that you cant build a coherent myth out of fragments. You can only hope that the audience will be too jolted -- and too turned on by the prospect of more jolts -- to care. This post has been corrected to show that the film came from the movie department of DC Entertainment. This post has been corrected to show that Brian Bolland was the artist on Batman The Killing Joke.

Photo Clay Enos AP Batman v Superman -- a long empty meeting 1 / 4 Back to Gallery Its all a big misunderstanding. Theyre great guys but they just dont get each other. But instead of meeting and talking about their differences and discussing what to do about the alien invasion -- oh yes theres one of those -- they get into a dispute that escalates and goes on and on and on ... ""Batman v Superman"" is an insanely long and convoluted action movie made worse by an air of importance. Its dispiriting and visually bland. A few years ago director Zack Snyder was the hope of the action genre whose films ""Watchmen"" and ""300"" were intuitive striking and psychologically penetrating. But here he settles for making something typical but in a bigger and more ponderous way. In the mood to get depressed? ""Batman v Superman"" starts with a flashback to Bruce Waynes parents getting killed because who could resist that bit of sadness? Then its off to the alien invasion of Gotham City which has Bruce so upset that he is driving around town like a lunatic while buildings are getting lasered out of existence. From there we flash forward 18 months to see Lois Lane witnessing a terrorist atrocity. Having fun yet? In the lead-up to this film the casting of Ben Affleck was a subject for controversy. But Affleck is perfect for this incarnation of Batman. The guy exudes moral inexactitude and misplaced certainty. He makes you believe he could really think that Superman is not a nice person. And he counters all expectation that he might preen and charm his way through the role by not smiling once during the entire movie. The audience doesnt smile either. In the aftermath of the alien invasion the government has turned lukewarm on Superman. Officials dont like the idea of depending on Supermans kindness. They want some leverage just in case he switches sides. Holly Hunter plays a senator heading a committee seeking to rein in Supermans activities and create some kind of oversight. Meanwhile businessman Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) reasons that the best way to control Superman is to stockpile lots of Kryptonite. As a senator Holly Hunter is completely natural and with the exception of Jeremy Irons as Alfred she is the only actor unaffected by being in a superhero movie. Everyone else tries to compensate as though thinking ""Im going to ignore this really awful material and act even more."" As Lex Luthor Jesse Eisenberg gives what will probably pass as a great performance -- he twitches raves talks slowly and then fast and he doesnt wipe his nose even when he needs to -- but its all surface calculated to impress and coming from nowhere. Hans Zimmers score matches the acting with music that is portentous and full of unearned meaning. When Superman and Batman finally meet in full costume Zimmer is practically losing his mind as though St. Paul and Plato or Lincoln and Washington or Jesus and Buddha were finally going to have a sit-down. The music is thundering and cresting and the world will never be the same. In that moment try to back up a second and perceive it from a distance. You might get a laugh. ""Batman v Superman"" -- the subtitle is ""Dawn of Justice"" -- is slow getting started setting out a number of plotlines. Basically Lex Luthor is the villain but because of press reports Superman and Batman develop a negative impression of each other. Movies based on misunderstandings tend to be more frustrating than entertaining. There are few things less interesting than watching people carry on stupidly when everything would be fine if theyd only talk for five minutes. Its even worse when the two participants are supposed to be moral paragons. Snyder sets his story in our modern world and attempts to fashion a kind of commentary on the media and the current geopolitical situation. What he has crafted instead is a grotesque expression of modern emptiness. A succession of national television journalists appear here cheapening their brand while the story itself is like meaninglessness in search of meaning. Theres an almost spiritual hunger in the hope that a meeting between Batman and Superman might amount to something but theres nothing there. And when theres nothing there what else can you do but blow things up? The scenes of destruction are interminable just a piling on as if at a certain point the right amount of violence will feel like a climax. It used to be that comparing movies to video games was more metaphorical than literal. But here theres no pretense that what were seeing onscreen is anything different from what wed see on a small screen. Its just buildings and people getting hit and disintegrating in silver bursts and its nothing but depressing. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic. Email mlasallesfchronicle.com.

Movie review Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice Article Tweet Warner Bros. Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill in Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice   (out of five) Director Zack Snyder Cast Ben Affleck Henry Cavill Gal Gadot Rating PG-13 (intense sequences of violence and action throughout sensuality) Run time 153 min. Related links Batman v Superman shows the trend of superhero films still packs a punch Batman v Superman and other epic clashes in pop culture By Preston Jonesdfw.comPosted 105pm on Wednesday Mar. 23 2016 Wednesday Mar. 23 2016 Wednesday Mar. 23 2016 By Preston Jones Fort Worth Star-Telegram In almost every measurable sense Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice is big. The level of anticipation is through the roof the amount of money invested (an estimated budget of 250 million) is staggering and the plot largely under wraps to this point is a gargantuan tangle of people places and things. But given the spoiler-phobic culture in which we exist -- so much so that the screening I attended was prefaced with a taped plea from director Zack Snyder to divulge none of the twists and turns so that other viewers may approach the film with its surprises intact -- writing about why it is such a colossal misfire becomes a delicate and difficult business. In that sense it is monumentally tricky to articulate precisely why this eagerly awaited superhero flick is the cinematic equivalent of lighting many millions of dollars ablaze with no regard for anything other than ensuring that the next decades worth of sequels prequels and other ancillary products is properly launched.So without giving anything away -- after all I would hate to disappoint Snyder someone for whom the wanton destruction of large metropolitan areas remains a clear and disturbing fetish -- I will say that Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice delivers nothing beyond CGI-enhanced spectacle.For some that will be more than enough watching Superman (Henry Cavill reprising the role) and Batman (Ben Affleck new to the cape and cowl) trade blows and snarled one-liners amid rain-soaked ruins of office buildings and abandoned mansions. Jeremy Irons turns up every now and again as the weary Alfred fretting and fixing things around the Batcave; Amy Adams returns as Lois Lane who toggles between damsel in distress and no-nonsense journalist; and Diane Lane reprises the thankless role of Martha Kent.For those who go to the movies to see coherent narratives Dawn of Justice is Hollywoods latest exercise in fan service above all else taking the usual screenplay ingredients of logic reason and character motivation tossing it all in a blender and filming the scraps. Again in dancing around the story without revealing too much suffice to say that Snyder and screenwriters Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer manage to desecrate not only Christopher Nolans ""Dark Knight"" trilogy (not that their oblivious dismantling stopped Nolan from taking a producing credit here) but also Frank Millers 1980s revisionism of Batman and one of the classic Superman story arcs involving Doomsday.Snyder and his collaborators are so busy establishing the DC Comics universe on screen with all the attendant bits of Easter-egg business that entails that they forget to make any of it worth sitting through. This is a film where the punishment isnt just shared among the stars Every second of its 153-minute run time is keenly felt. It should tell you everything about Dawn of Justice that Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) arrives in the film more or less as she does in the trailer -- hey all of a sudden there she isIt doesnt help that the films nominal villain Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) is played like some kind of half-crazed Mark Zuckerberg all grand vision and irritating tics and whose most menacing characteristic is that he might start speaking again. There is much much more including several false endings but all of it -- so much sound and fury signifying nothing -- feels like little more than a forced march through the burnishing of Warner Bros. intellectual property. There is no sense of urgency no dramatic stakes. So much of the film feels like marking time until Batman and Superman go at it but once they do even that confrontation is anticlimactic.Technically Dawn of Justice is proficient but after about an hour viewers might feel as if they have been clobbered into submission between cinematographer Larry Fongs frenzied images and Hans Zimmer and Junkie XLs thudding ham-handed score.All of it from opening credits to the final shamelessly sequel-stoking image before the cut to black is aggressively big loud intense filmmaking with all the subtlety of an elbow to the nose. Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice is not however too big to fail -- that it manages to do all too well.

""If we believe theres even a 1 percent chance that hes our enemy we have to take it as an absolute certainty."" Paranoid? Sure. But its easy to stir up fear and uncertainty in these troubled times and who better than Lex Luthor a nut-ball mogul with long hair and a penchant for quoting The Wizard of Oz to do so? Thats the dynamic at play in Zack Snyders booming brooding Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice in which the DC Comics heroes - Ben Affleck in his first venture as the Dark Knight Henry Cavill back for a second turn as the Man of Steel - are joined by Jesse Eisenberg as the jittery millennial Luthor who would like nothing better than to take Superman down. For good. For bad. For necessity. After all whats a superhero supposed to do if there isnt a megalomaniacal villain around to pester him? Clocking in at two hours and 33 minutes with maybe two jokes in the whole shebang Batman v Superman lacks the levity (forced or otherwise) of a typical Marvel Cinematic Universe entry. But Snyders superpowered epic does have a sense of import and grandeur about it. This is after all the first time these icons of pop culture have squared off on the big screen (Afflecks got the squarer jaw) and theres a gravitas here that even the most stale of comic book tropes cant diminish. Snyder who directed Man of Steel and the failed comic book adaptation Watchmen is nothing less than respectful. The effects arent bad either. And one-liners or no one-liners the Marvel brand certainly comes to mind Warner Bros. has been busy playing catch-up trying to do with its stable of DC Comics superheroes what Disney has already done in spades with the Marvel gang. Batman v Superman is designed to serve as a launching pad for a whole Justice League franchise. If you blink you might miss Aquaman and the Flash but theyre here among the ""metahumans"" that Wayne discovers when he cracks some seriously encrypted database back at Bat HQ. One of those metahumans - Diana Prince a.k.a. Wonder Woman - does get a little more screen time. As played by Gal Gadot (Gisele of the Fast amp; Furious pics) Ms. Prince shows up at several fancy-pants society events slinking about knowingly in drop-dead couture. There has been a year or so of press about Gadots casting as Wonder Woman and shes teased in the Batman v Superman trailers too. So as the clock keeps ticking (and there is a clock that keeps ticking by the way warning of the dire fate that awaits someone close to Clark Kent) you start to wonder when Wonder Woman is going to appear. She does finally slinging her magic lasso at a genetically engineered King Kong-like monster and striking a few supermodel-y superheroic poses while shes at it. But for the longest time as things go ka-boom as dockside warehouses are sprayed with gunfire as Amy Adams (Kent/Supermans newspaper reporter girlfriend) falls in and out of jeopardy as Laurence Fishburne (Daily Planet editor Perry White) worries about newsroom cutbacks as Jeremy Irons (Waynes majordomo Alfred) assists his boss in high-tech ways Wonder Woman is nowhere to be found. Which gives Affleck and Cavill and their ""freaks dressed like clowns"" characters something in common with another archetypal twosome Vladimir and Estragon those guys standing around yammering in that famous Samuel Beckett play.

Suddenly Superman -- the Man of Steel himself -- is spotted soaring in the sky. Wow There he isHe soon lands atop a skyscraper. Is he going to save a woman in peril? Help an aircraft land safely perhaps? Not exactly. He proceeds to ... testify at a Senate committee hearing about nuclear weapons. Stars As Superheroes Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures/ TM amp; (c) DC Comics Thats just one of many anticlimactic moments in the lackluster Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice (opening March 25). Though hyped for more than a year as a Clash of the Titans epic the final product is 151 minutes of gloom and doom. Not only is it the anti-Deadpool it takes itself more seriously than a Best Picture Oscar winner. Perry White (Laurence Fishburne left) and Clark Kent/Superman (Henry Cavill) Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures/ TM amp; (c) DC Comics Batman gets top billing in the title but this is essentially a sequel to 2013s equally laborious Man of Steel. Indeed this films prologue is a reprise of the final clash between Superman (Henry Cavill) and General Zod up in the clouds above Metropolis -- but from the perspective of the panicked citizens on the ground. For once the mass destruction on display in countless comic book films has real consequences. Many locals lost their lives that day while other survivors jumped into action to help. Among them billionaire businessman Bruce Wayne (a salt-and-pepper-haired Ben Affleck scowling to perfection). The new POV is quite ingenious. Costars Reunited Clark Kent/Superman (Henry Cavill) and Lois Lane (Amy Adams) Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures/ TM amp; (c) DC Comics That marks the first and last time you will be able to follow the inner workings of a convoluted screenplay. The story immediately jumps 18 months to an island in the Indian Ocean where natives stumble upon Kryptonite rocks. Elsewhere Superman helps Lois Lane (Amy Adams) escape from terrorists in Africa. This too is loosely tied to the Kryptonite. In Gotham Bruce uses his vigilante Batman alter ego to plot revenge against Superman. And tech mogul Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) figures out a way to use these events in his favor and lord over all.We havent even gotten to Gal Gadots elusive Wonder Woman yet. Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures/ TM amp; (c) DC Comics Director Zack Snyder shows no mercy in throwing a slew of disconnected scenes at the audience. Blink and Lois is persuading her Daily Planet editor (Laurence Fishburne) to travel to Washington D.C. to get answers from a congressman. Blink again and Superman is staging a rescue in Mexico during its Day of the Dead celebration. He also has time to trek to Smallville to visit his mother (Diane Lane). Over in Gotham Bruce uses handy-dandy technology to learn the identity of a beautiful woman (Gadot) eyeing him at a party. All this big-budget narrative window-dressing muddles the basics -- such as you know who exactly is mad at who and why. Celebrity Hunks Cry Movies That Make Them Sad And yet Snyder botches the only scene fans truly crave the fight between the classic superheroes. After an intriguing teaser (in which Batman snarls to Superman ""Do you bleed? You will"") the brawl is a head-scratching letdown. These are two extraordinary men plagued by tormented souls; mommy issues should not be a make-or-break factor. (This is not a spoiler I swear.) You may not even be capable of seeing the duel as its staged in pitch black in the pouring rain. The first Spider-Man movie aside is that cliche backdrop ever effective? Bruce Wayne/Batman (Ben Affleck) Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures/ TM amp; (c) DC Comics The metaphorical darkness is more problematic. If the success of the delightfully twisted Deadpool proved anything its that moviegoers prefer their comic book pics bright and loose with a side of self-knowing wit. (That winning combination also worked for Guardians of the Galaxy and the Avengers flicks.) You could even make a case that Christopher Nolans superb Batman trilogy reached its apex with The Dark Knight due to Heath Ledgers live-wire Joker. A popcorn film -- and this is a popcorn film -- should never feel like Sunday night homework. Read This is not the place to introduce a story line such as the mystery behind the delivery of arms to rebels in Africa. When real-life news personalities including Anderson Cooper and Nancy Grace pose deep existential questions about whether Superman should be viewed as a god it comes off as pontificating blather. Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures/ TM amp; (c) DC Comics Maybe a standout snarky villain would have helped the cause. But Eisenbergs Lex Luthor is terribly miscast. The actor plays him like an overcaffeinated Mark Zuckerberg all twitchy and bratty. Hes got billions and drones on and on about his thirst for power. So what? Hes a diminutive twerp. The superbuff and glowering Affleck and Cavill look like they can overtake him with one halfhearted punch to the gut. Oh boy (wonder). Dawn of Justice isnt just a movie by the way. Its also the dawn of a new high-stakes cinematic D.C. Comics universe in which characters such as Wonder Woman the Flash Aquaman and Cyborg all get their own stand-alone features. Alas as of now this franchise desperately needs saving.Cant get enough of Us?

The cost in terms both structural and human? Credit ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice"" for trying to answer those questions and other superhero-related queries besides.And then blame it for burying any such thinking in the usual clamor of explosions and battles.Yes questions regarding violence and mayhem are drowned out by violence and mayhem. Such is the superhero life as directed by Zack Snyder. There is no problem that cant be solved with a cranium-rattling explosion or two.Jesse Eisenberg plays Lex Luthor in ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice."" (Photo Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.) Seriously there is some good stuff here. Something happens at one point that is so different from whats usual in these testosterone-soaked affairs that you may find yourself cheering. Except it happens more than two hours in and lasts about five minutes.But dont worry. It portends the first of many many sequels.Thats what Snyder is really up to here -- universe building in the manner of Marvel Comics which has done so with wild success. There are billions of reasons DC would want in on this game.RELATED Michael Keatons Batman v Christopher Reeves Superman Whod win? | Top 10 comic book moviesFor now Snyder sets the stage with yet another iteration of how Bruce Wayne became Batman -- murder of innocent parents turning a kid into a vigilante is evidently irresistible to filmmakers and why wouldnt it be? He goes back and forth between the origin story and the adult Wayne (Ben Affleck thumbing his nose at doubting fanboys with a good performance) watching Superman and Zod destroy the skyline -- including his building where his employees work.Clark Kent (Henry Cavill center) has a newsroom confab with Lois Lane (Amy Adams) and Perry White (Laurence Fishburne) in ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice."" (Photo Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.)Its an intriguing idea more so than the parallel story of Superman (Henry Cavill back for more) and Lois Lane (Amy Adams ditto) down in the dumps questioning what the role of the Man of Steel should be in the world. Does he fly around willy-nilly saving people even if it means collateral damage (most of it more perception than anything else)? Or does he serve some sort of human-imposed system of justice? This too sounds like fodder for an interesting exploration but mostly they mope.Plus there are political shenanigans afoot and a senator (Holly Hunter) wants to hold hearings on the Superman matter. At one point she says ""This is how a democracy works. We talk to each other."" Given the current political climate I had to remind myself that this isnt a comedy.RELATED Beyond Batman This weeks new movies Meanwhile Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg in full-on crazy mode with a few Heath-Ledger-as-Joker tics thrown in) wants to ground Superman for good though he claims he just wants to develop a Kryptonite-based weapon to protect against future Zods. Sure. Always trust the brilliant psycho.But its all secondary to the grudge nursed by the man who saw Superman help destroy his building and inadvertently kill his friends and employees (yes in the service of saving the world but details details) Bruce Wayne. Hes been getting more violent in his vigilante role to the chagrin of ever-loyal Alfred (Jeremy Irons) and hes had about enough of this Superman character.Gal Gadot and Ben Affleck in ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice."" (Photo Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.)Yes they fight. Which is after all why they named the movie what they did. I wont say who wins but who loses is anyone who thinks the battle will be anything more than two guys in capes smashing each other into walls. (Thats not necessarily a bad thing -- in theory Snyder has bigger fish to fry.)And what of Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) whose presence has been so ballyhooed? Why havent I paid more attention to her? Because Snyder doesnt either dropping her into the story here and there with little to no character development until she can have a proper introduction in the field of battle. (Its no coincidence that ""Wonder Woman"" set for 2017 is the next film in the budding franchise. Maybe theyre saving the character development for that.)Its tempting to say that ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice"" isnt as smart as it thinks it is. But the way Snyder buries his good ideas with the superhero clutter maybe it was never really aiming that high to begin with.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Superman Is Too Weighty to Soar but It Has Its Moments Tuesday March 22 2016 at 1015 p.m. By Bilge Ebiri EXPAND Courtesy Warner Bros. Pictures/DC Comics A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Zack Snyders Batman v. Superman Dawn of Justice opens with one of those grim proclamations that the creators of modern superhero movies are so fond of ""There was a time above a time before"" intones the voice of Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) over a by now de rigueur childhood flashback to his parents death at the hands of a mugger. ""There were perfect things"" he continues as we see young Bruce fall down the shaft leading to the bats that will one day give his alter ego a name. ""But things fall apart things on Earth and what falls...is fallen."" Look the guys a masked vigilante not a philosopher-poet. Unfortunately thats just what Batman v. Superman -- thunderous ponderous occasionally exciting -- keeps trying to turn him into. He isnt alone. Nearly every character in this ultimate superhero matchup gets reams of dialogue about good and evil and man and God and virtue and sacrifice and our fallen fallen world. ""Devils dont come from the hell beneath. No they come from the sky"" ""If God is all powerful then he cant be all good. And if hes all good then he cant be all powerful"" By the time Kevin Costner shows up to relate a folksy memory about a bad flood his ""hero cake"" and some drowning horses (dont ask) you might find yourself stifling giggles. Film Details Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time151 min. More Info Trailer But laughing -- seemingly ever -- is the last thing Snyder wants you to do. The director clearly wants his film to mean something. For much of it Superman (Henry Cavill) is treated as an absolute -- more a philosophical conundrum than a man. The script draws explicit connections between him and drone warfare and there are endless discussions about whether we can trust one person to have all that power. (""He has the power to wipe out the entire human race"" Wayne insists. ""If we believe that theres even a 1 percent chance that he is our enemy we have to take it as an absolute certainty."") The film seems to spend much of its first half in both literal and figurative slow motion as characters mutter and mull and ponder these issues often in the least compelling ways. Meanwhile theres the story itself which is driven by the revelation that in the hilariously destructive climax of Man of Steel Superman and General Zod (Michael Shannon) happened to vaporize a Wayne Enterprises building filled with Bruces employees. Thats an interesting idea Batmans motive is not dissimilar to any number of Hollywood villains before him. Think of all the bombed-out villages and devastated families that helped birth the bad guys in movies like The Peacemaker and Three Kings.But amazingly for a film that practically defines overkill Batman v. Superman doesnt do much with the notion; it could have been fascinating to see Batman as a true villain but that probably wouldnt go over well with Corporate. Instead the heroes differences get egged along by young irritating tech billionaire Lex Luthor (played by Mark Zuckerberg himself Jesse Eisenberg) who has an elaborate and not at all confusing plan that involves getting a stash of deadly green Kryptonite from the wreckage of General Zods ship and then convincing Batman to use it. (He has other schemes too but best not to get into those here.)Also looking into Luthors plans is Wonder Woman a/k/a Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) a mysterious Amazon who captivates (and briefly collaborates with) Wayne but otherwise doesnt get much to do until the climax. The film uses the actresss intense gaze well but shes been given hardly any character or dialogue to work with. Even so Batman v. Superman does come to life whenever shes onscreen and not just because composers Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL have outfitted her with a rousing charging musical theme that offers a welcome contrast to the rest of the brooding soundtrack. Also not having much dialogue shes one of the few characters who doesnt have to issue pseudo-Joseph Campbellian proclamations about power and heroes and goodness and evil and the individual and oh god make it stop. The whole being a big lumbering ball of portent were left with pieces. And some of those are good. Snyder shoots Batmans exploits like a horror movie full of dashing handheld shots in shadowy corridors and looming figures on dark walls and its tremendously effective. Theres one thrillingly bizarre sequence involving Batman and Superman and their soldiers (what?) fighting in a blasted cityscape; it seems to come out of nowhere like some sort of dream projection though Im sure it has some kind of comic-book antecedent or will at the very least pay off in one of the many sequels DC and Warner have planned.There are nice smaller touches too A poster for John Boormans Excalibur in the opening scene finds a sly echo in the climax. The idea of Bruces butler/partner-in-crime Alfred (Jeremy Irons) being a bitter old man nursing a tumbler of whiskey makes savvy character sense; the years have done a number on him. And the gunshot-like sonic boom whenever Superman takes flight nicely encapsulates in a single sound effect the philosophical issues surrounding the character. But dammit all that gloom. All that slow motion. All that talk. This kind of subtext-made-text is the superhero comics bread and butter of course. But a filmmaker must make this stuff work onscreen by expressing those ideas through images and words that will linger in our minds. And for all of Batman v. Supermans chatter not once does it give us a line half as evocative and memorable as The Dark Knights ""Some men just want to watch the world burn."" The movies not bad but it doubles down on its least interesting and potent elements at the expense of those that actually work. In the end the film is as forgettable as the dime-store philosophy that fuels it.Batman v. Superman Dawn of Justice Directed by Zack Snyder Warner Bros.

Richard Roeper richardroeper | email WARNING MINOR SPOILERS TO FOLLOW. RELAX IM WITHHOLDING 90 PERCENT OF THE SURPRISES I PROMISE About a half-hour into ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice"" I was starting to feel this could be one of the best superhero movies of the last 20 years. Alas we go from spectacular to solid from great to good. That said Zack Snyders hotly anticipated showdown of two great DC Comics icons is hardly a disappointment -- and please see it on the biggest IMAX screen within 50 miles of your home if you can. ""Dawn of Justice"" is a dark-palette feast for the eyes with some memorable set pieces just the right amount of dark humor strong performances and so many inside references and hints of characters and films to come there could be an entire day of Comic-Con panels just about the spoilers and the teasers and the ""WHOA"" moments. In an opening flashback to 1982 young master Wayne and his parents are exiting a movie theater when tragedy strikes. (We must be up to a dozen movies and television shows that have depicted the brutal murders of Bruces beloved mother and father.) The scene is filled with some haunting and chilling images e.g. Bruces mothers pearls getting snagged over the barrel of a gun in her last breathing moments. Cut to present day and a title card reading ""MANKIND IS INTRODUCED TO THE SUPERMAN"" I love that. Were plunged into a breathtaking sequence in which we see the epic final battle between Superman (Henry Cavill) and Gen. Zod in which half of Metropolis was leveled -- but its from the viewpoint of none other than Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) who apparently now has headquarters in Metropolis. Snyder films the scene with gritty realism including some shots that seem deliberately to pay homage to 9/11. Even though WE know Superman was on the side of good and Zod was evil on that fateful day Bruce Wayne and nearly all of the citizens of Metropolis had no idea what was transpiring. Now heres where ""Dawn of Justice"" gets a little murky. It seems as if Metropolis (home of Clark Kent/Superman Lois Lane the Daily Planet etc.) is practically a twin city with Gotham (home of Bruce Wayne/Batman Alfred the butler et al). In a scene where Bruce Wayne shows up at a party hosted by young Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) Lex says ""You should hop over the harbor more often."" Some 18 months later Superman is well established as a good guy. Theres even a Heroes Park (built by Lexcorp) with a giant statue of Superman. When the Man of Steel performs amazing rescue missions around the globe some kneel and bow their heads or reach out to try to touch him treating him as a deity from the heavens. Others are expressing concern about Supermans limitless powers. Look at all the collateral damage that occurs whenever Superman swoops in and saves the day. (Hooray. For years Ive been wondering why the Avengers and the X-Men and Superman and Batman not to mention the mortal action heroes of the ""Die Hard"" and ""Fast and Furious"" and James Bond movies almost never even pause to consider how many innocent lives are lost how many cities are destroyed as they duke it out with the bad guys.) Holly Hunter delivers strong sharp-edged work as a Kentucky senator who wants to hold hearings to see if Superman should be held accountable for deaths that have occurred when hes swooping in to save the day. Meanwhile Bruce Wayne/Batman is angry frustrated and exhausted after 20 years of battling criminals in Gotham (and presumably Metropolis). At this point Batman is in full vigilante mode literally branding criminals with the Batman logo before serving them up to authorities. Even Bruces loyal butler Alfred (the magnificent Jeremy Irons) is in unshaven deeply cynical mode spouting out Shakespearean lines about the nature of justice and muttering about his boss never settling down and starting a family. Snyder and screenwriters Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer raise some interesting questions about humankinds love/fear/worship/hate relationship with all-powerful beings whether they are God or Allah or Buddha or Superman. At times the metaphors get a bit heavy-handed as when protesters in Washington D.C. hoist signs that read ""SUPERMAN = ILLEGAL ALIEN."" We get it we get it. Heres what rocks. We all know Batman even with all his fighting skills and his cool toys and his cunning would be no match one-on-one against Superman. ""Dawn of Justice"" figures out a way to level the playing field and then some. And though Gal Gadots Diana Prince/Wonder Woman sometimes seems crowbarred into the plot there are a couple of moments guaranteed to get the hardcore geek base well geeked. All the Internet resistance to Affleck being cast as Batman seems silly when you see him sharing the screen with Cavill as Affleck is easily the superior actor. (Cavill is solid but theres not all that much difference in his facial expressions registering anger fear pain or love. He winces quite a bit.) Theres not a moment when we dont believe Affleck as Bruce Wayne or as Batman. Amy Adams Lois Lane is a modern self-sufficient strong woman -- but she still needs rescuing by Superman every other week. Jesse Eisenbergs twitchy self-conscious mannerisms can be irritating in some performances but hes a creepy delight here as Lex Luthor. First-rate actors such as Diane Lane and Laurence Fishburne sparkle in small roles. With a running time of 2 hours 33 minutes ""Dawn of Justice"" like most superhero movies just keeps on coming and coming -- especially in the climactic battle sequence which isnt all that different from the climactic battle sequences in a dozen other superhero movies. And the final surprise will come as a surprise to just about no one. When it sings ""Dawn of Justice"" is a wonder. When it drags it still looks good and offers hints of a better scene just around the corner.  Warner Bros. presents a film directed by Zack Snyder and written by Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer based on characters from DC Comics. Running time 153 minutes. Rated PG-13 (for intense sequences of violence and action throughout and some sensuality. Opens Thursday at local theaters.

"Batman v Superman review Yawn of justice - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Batman v Superman review Yawn of justice Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice official trailer The trailer for ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice"" was released on April 17 2015. The movie is set for theaters on March 25 2016. The trailer for ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice"" was released on April 17 2015. The movie is set for theaters on March 25 2016. Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune A near-total drag ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice"" plays like a loose unofficial quarter-billion-dollar remake of ""The Odd Couple"" in which Oscar and Felix are literally trying to kill each other.I kid. A little. This certainly is not true of director Zack Snyders solemn melee. The movie does not kid. It takes the mournful death knells of the Christopher Nolan ""Batman"" trilogy and cranks up the volume while ignoring any of the visual strengths and moral provocations found in Nolans best work. Nothing I have to say about Snyders technique will mean anything to anyone at Warner Brothers if ""Batman v Superman"" does what it needs to do i.e. gross a billion or more worldwide thus setting up ready-made audiences for the chain of interrelated DC Comics movies in production and pre-production. The actors in Snyders two-and-a-half-hour lesson in jaw-jutting and awkwardly framed handheld camerawork save what they can where they can. I particularly enjoyed Jeremy Irons Alfred who clearly should be running the show rather than his boss zillionaire three-day-stubble boy Bruce Wayne aka Batman played by Ben Affleck. Amy Adams as Lois Lane remains an asset as well.Crucially theres a new headliner in town even if shes not yet playing the big room. Gal Gadots Wonder Woman helps out in one of several climactic destruction festivals featured in ""Batman v Superman."" Long before she actually suits up though youre good and sick of waiting for Gadot to hijack all the rage-y steroidal bone-crushing smackdowns setting the tone in Snyders literal blockbuster. Afflecks adversary is played by Henry Cavill who hit his green-screen marks well enough in Snyders 2013 ""Man of Steel"" (which is looking better every minute). Still in ""Batman v Superman"" hes as narcissistic a Superman as youll ever see. Cavill never shouldve taken on ""The Man From U.N.C.L.E.""; working on that project with director Guy Ritchie perhaps the only successful contemporary filmmaker whose facility with big-screen action is more assaultive and aggravating than Snyders he seems to have crossed an invisible line of smugness from which it is difficult to return. Batman v Superman Ben Affleck Henry Cavill and Zack Snyder talk superhero smack down Josh Rottenberg Forget Hillary versus the Donald. Hollywood has its own clash of the titans coming and its likely to be yuge. Comic-book fans have long debated who would win in an all-out battle between two of the superhero realms most formidable icons Batman and Superman. In director Zack Snyders ""Batman... Forget Hillary versus the Donald. Hollywood has its own clash of the titans coming and its likely to be yuge. Comic-book fans have long debated who would win in an all-out battle between two of the superhero realms most formidable icons Batman and Superman. In director Zack Snyders ""Batman... (Josh Rottenberg) Having killed thousands of innocent bystanders at the end of ""Man of Steel"" high-flying alien Superman is now considered a pariah by many. Batman meanwhile has hardened into a boozy sociopath (a ""criminal"" says Wayne himself) who wants to murder the alien invader with the ""S"" as badly as Lex Luthor played by a skittery occasionally amusing Jesse Eisenberg. Luthor wants to destroy them both.An hour into ""Batman v. Superman"" you wonder Can we just settle this little spat and move on to Gadots ""Wonder Woman"" movie?In the comic book superhero universe be it DC or Marvel or an outlier each new franchise cycle divides audiences between those who appreciate the dark nasty stuff quality issues aside and the nostalgists whod rather take it easy and have what the old folks call ""a good time."" The action in most superhero outings dives headlong Frank Miller ""Sin City""-style into the muck and depravity of the modern world whether its dramatically satisfying or not. A super-scary Jesse Eisenberg? Meet the new Lex Luthor in Batman v Superman Meredith Woerner ""I had a Mentos. Do you want one?"" Perched in a glass conference room wearing a T-shirt with the sleeves hiked up actor Jesse Eisenberg unrolls candy mints and makes polite conversation. Meet the new face of the Machiavellian comic-book supervillain Lex Luthor. Eisenberg has just finished filming... ""I had a Mentos. Do you want one?"" Perched in a glass conference room wearing a T-shirt with the sleeves hiked up actor Jesse Eisenberg unrolls candy mints and makes polite conversation. Meet the new face of the Machiavellian comic-book supervillain Lex Luthor. Eisenberg has just finished filming... (Meredith Woerner) The ""Batman v Superman"" script by Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer plows familiar ground for much of its 153 minutes revisiting the brutal murder of Bruce Waynes parents and starting off where ""Man of Steel"" ended with Superman and General Zod leveling much of Metropolis which saved our planet long-term but piled up a lot of unseen corpses in the short-term. Batman is epically miffed. And while Eisenbergs Luthor develops a precious hunk of Kryptonite for his own genocidal purposes the big boys inch closer often in Snyders preferred hackneyed slow-mo to the battle royale.Diane Lane returns as the widowed Martha Kent here abducted by Slavic dastards and threatened with blowtorch disfigurement and death. (What is this ""Taken"" or ""Saw""?) A terrorist bombing on a major D.C. landmark is just another tasteless ill-timed ""gotcha"" moment. Human trafficking intimations of child abuse (Luthor mutters about suffering his fathers ""fist and abominations"") a hollowed-out Superman resigning himself to the notion that ""no one stays good in this world"" ... the film is only slightly more pessimistic than Lars von Triers ""Antichrist."" Youd have to go back to Mel Gibsons ""Passion of the Christ"" to find this much Christian iconography wedded to this much sadism.Snyder is not without skills or ideas but when a critic finds himself at odds with almost every aspect of a directors visual approach to material like this material like this becomes pretty joyless. Compare the first big sequence in ""Batman v Superman"" featuring the Batmobile in action to the Bat Cycle/semi-trailer truck game of chicken in Nolans ""The Dark Knight."" The latter builds beautifully and shows off the toys and old-fashioned non-digital effects with serious class. The ""Batman v Superman"" equivalent is pure empty noise fireballs; the usual overdose of insane automatic gunfire; and absolutely no rhythm.""You dont owe this world a thing"" Lane tells Superman at one point. Maybe so. But at this point in the twinned mythologies of two extremely hardy DC heroes humankind deserves a better blockbuster.Michael Phillips is a Tribune Newspapers critic.mjphillipstribpub.comTwitter phillipstribune ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice"" -- 1.5 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for intense sequences of violence and action throughout and some sensuality) Running time 233Opens Thursday evening Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Christopher Nolan Henry Cavill Zack Snyder Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice Gal Gadot Jesse Eisenberg Mel Gibson Ben Affleck talks about the possibility of directing his own Batman movie The Caped Crusade details the cultural history of Batman When Batman beat Superman in the age of LBJ Batman versus Superman Who has the advantage?

The movie crams together a Batman story a Superman story and lays the groundwork for several side tales all in the space of a cluttered two-and-a-half hour collision that aims to bludgeon viewers into submission.Its a lot and yet the experience is rather empty; underneath all the smashing and crashing there isnt much there. It is so burdened by its responsibility to set up a franchise that it barely takes the time to exist in the present and Snyder is so encumbered by the idea that superhero films are supposed to be serious business that he forgets to have any fun. This is Batman and Superman not a funeral procession.DETROIT NEWSBatman v Superman puts Detroit on the big screenThe film introduces Ben Affleck as Batman and while Affleck looks good in a suit as Bruce Wayne he doesnt have the same level of sophistication as previous Batmen such as Christian Bale or Michael Keaton. His is more of a working class Bruce Wayne (he does CrossFit to train which is very 2016 of him) and the movie relies on what we already know about Batman to fill in the gaps in his character (although it opens as all Batman tales seem to do with the murder of his parents).Henry Cavill is back as Superman returning to the role he originated in Snyders similarly torturous ""Man of Steel"" which to watch was to understand what its like to be a pinball during a high score game. Mankind is struggling with what to make of the messianic figure and how to govern the Superman (Snyder would like to see the tale as a religious allegory if only it were so deep). Among those who want Superman stopped are Lex Luthor (played with devilish glee by Jesse Eisenberg) and Batman who decides the neighboring towns of Metropolis and Gotham City arent big enough for the both of them.Simple enough but the story (credited to screenwriters Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer) still manages to be convoluted and struggles to ignite fireworks the way a showdown between the two comic icons should. Once Bats and Supes do meet its all brute force which is the only language Snyder speaks. Previous ""Batman"" movies worked because they were grounded in some semblance of reality but its hard to take something seriously when the characters are being tossed through cinder block walls and shoved through concrete floors for one-third of the running time.Detroit has a starring role in much of the chaos early scenes depict downtown Detroit as Metropolis (including Fort St. between Griswold St. and Washington Blvd.); the Russell Industrial Center gets a glimpse or two; and Michigan Central Station is the backdrop for much of the big showdown between the two titans. (The building is also a favorite of Michael Bay making it a premier location for directors who confuse loud clanging as substance.)Theres plenty more including the introduction of Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) and glimpses at several other eventual Justice League members and a late-in-the-game villain who raises the level of cacophony several thousand decibels. By the end it feels what it must be like to go 12 rounds with Batman and Superman. Its a superhero-sized headache.agrahamdetroitnews.comgrahamoramaBatman v Superman Dawn of JusticeGRADE CRated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action throughout and some sensualityRunning time 151 minutes 231 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 46 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1MltHXE MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/2016/03/23/review-batman-v-superman-exhausting-showdown/82151448/,200,batman34,batman,detroitnews

Zack Snyders second Superman movie brings on Batman introduces Wonder Woman gives us a quick peek at Aquaman and works hard to set up DCs own multi-hero franchise the Justice League of America. But its all a little tired slow and confused - as if these Depression-era superheroes were finally showing their real age. The new film briefly reprises the end of 2013s Superman reboot ""Man of Steel"" to show us an eyewitness we hadnt noticed - Bruce Wayne who arrives in Metropolis just in time to see the Wayne Enterprises skyscraper knocked down. Yeah that confused me too. Maybe Metropolis offered a sweet tax rebate if hed move his corporate headquarters? Anyway Wayne now becomes convinced that Superman is a dangerous lunatic - which is kind of funny considering Batman likes to wear a rubber suit and has started branding captured criminals. But while Batmans hunting down the Krypton Kid Alexander ""Lex"" Luthor - a spoiled and brilliant brat played by Hollywoods go-to guy for annoying geniuses Jesse Eisenberg - is coming up with a plan to kill both of them and wipe out Metropolis. Or maybe Gotham. Who cares anyway at this point? Not me certainly as the film meanders along playing less like a prequel for the JLA than a greatest-hits medley of every superhero movie ever made - a little ""Dark Knight Rises"" here a bit of ""Batman Begins"" there all spiced up with some ""X-Men"" topicality. The thing is none of it convinces. No not the superhuman creatures in flowing capes. The mood. Look back at your favorite comic-book films and what youll notice first is their honesty. Christopher Nolan committed to the dark shadows of his Batman pictures; the equal-rights struggle thats at the heart of the first ""X-Men"" film was one Bryan Singer believed in. MORE Batman v Superman trailer a let-down But although director Zac Snyder is a great visualist all he has here is pretty pictures and giant (and confusing) action sequences. Nothing feels very new and its not just because we get yet another flashback to how young Bruces parents were killed. The idea of Superman-as-Jesus (which was already overdone in ""Man of Steel"") gets trotted out again and worked to death as does the character of the endlessly traumatized Dark Knight. And whenever interest flags which is often? Time for Snyder to suddenly insert another out-of-nowhere nightmare for Batman. Even Superman gets a mad hallucination. But then in an airless and artificial movie like this one maybe its from lack of oxygen. Yes both actors look great. Henry Cavill is a real superhero every time he takes off his shirt and Ben Affleck sports some very distinguished grey at his temples. (Given his last year of marital woes and tabloid adventures maybe its real.) And the introduction of Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman adds fresh interest to the proceedings - even if shes only given a few scattered scenes and is late to the finale. Shes got backstory. Shes got attitude. In fact she got me wondering what this movie would have been like if she were the star and these guys in capes her supporting players. (Shes due to get her own smaller-scale film next year.) But hey lets not get ahead of ourselves. Men flying through the air and living in high-tech caves? Thats one thing. But a big-budget high-stakes franchise-opener built around a strong female character? Thats just crazy talk. Ratings note The film contains violence and strong language. Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice (PG-13) Warner Bros. (153 min.) Directed by Zack Snyder. With Ben Affleck Henry Cavill Gal Gadot. Now playing in New Jersey.

A scene from Batman v Superman Dawn Of Justice Its so topheavy with false portent that it buckles under its own weight As superhero spectacles go Zack Snyders Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice is a grand one with a mondo-operatic climax and a final shot infused with quivering exhilarating molecules of grace. Its also not much fun Barely a minute goes by when there isnt a character or real-life talking head (Charlie Rose and Neil deGrasse Tyson both make cameos) showing up with some droning pronouncement about how humans today savvy and mistrustful as we are still need to believe in gods and heroes. The picture is thick with allusions to ""aliens"" as enemies of the people dangerous forces that will only come back stronger when we try to vanquish them. At one point a villain with some crazy ideas intones ""God is tribal. God takes sides."" All of these statements are intended to provoke thought of the political or spiritual kind but theyre simultaneously too unshaped and too obvious. Snyder floats them onscreen like ominous nighttime clouds onto which we can project our own Batsignals of meaning. Read More Heres Why the Batman v Superman Director Cast Ben Affleck Instead of Christian Bale Why oh why cant we just get what we came for? That is a good meat-and-potatoes showdown between a brooding vigilante in a pointy-eared mask (Ben Afflecks Batman a.k.a. asocial rich guy Bruce Wayne) and a simpler sunnier protector of humankind (Henry Cavills Superman who when hes not in tights struts around in criminally sexy horn-rimmed glasses as reporter Clark Kent). Batman v Superman lunges for greatness instead of building toward it Its so topheavy with false portent that it buckles under its own weight. Snyder the man behind the Thermopylae phantasm 300 as well as the flawed but raggedly affecting riot-grrrl head trip Sucker Punch is an ambitious visual stylist. And there are more than a few dazzling sequences in Batman v Superman including an apocalyptic dream battle in which spindly winged terrors imported straight from a Guillermo del Toro nightmare buzz menacingly in the margins while poor Batman gets the batstuffing kicked out of him in the foreground. Incidentally the brutality of Batman v Superman is the heavy-duty bone-crunching sort a factor you might want to consider if youre thinking of taking very small kids. Read More Superman Declared a False God in OfficialBatman v Superman Trailer But then fun isnt what were after when we venture out of the fairly jaunty Marvel Universe and into the relatively irony-free DC Comics one Snyder and screenwriters Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer work overtime to make these superheroes superserious further embroidering all the basic psychological motivations and hangups their creators -- Batmans Bob Kane and Bill Finger and Supermans Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster -- gave them in the first place. Both carry scars of childhood trauma and both are social misfits Bruce Wayne/Batman is too self-absorbed to fit in while Clark Kent/Superman is a literal alien an outsider perpetually looking into the world of humans but unable to fully join it. They certainly have a lot to talk about -- and to fight about. But the enmity between these two never jells as it should. Batman v Superman traces the source of the duos disquiet to the collateral damage Superman inflicted while saving Metropolis from General Zods giant three-toed metal spacekiller (as seen in Snyders 2013 Man of Steel). Bruce Wayne watches glowering as Superman zips through the sky saving most of the citys people but inadvertently causing harm with some errant eyefry. A U.S. Senator from Kentucky (Holly Hunters Jane Finch) also worries that Superman might have too much power and enters an ill-advised alliance with Supermans arch enemy Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) who is actually Lex Luthor Jr. LexCorp heir and all-out nutter. Read More Ben Affleck Shares Behind-the-Scenes Photos From Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice In a picture thats constantly in danger of being ground down by its own gloom the brittle lightness of Eisenbergs high-strung savant is a relief. His sentences unspool like wiry puzzles; in need of Ritalin he speaks in riddles. The stunning and aristocratic Gal Gadot shows up all too briefly as Diana Prince/Wonderwoman Its a delight to watch her laugh in the face of danger which is exactly the opposite of the demands placed on poor Cavill and Affleck. Mostly theyre called upon to act with their jaws both of which are at least quite magnificent. Read More Batman v Superman Almost Featured These Two Villains But a good jaw will get you only so far. Affleck sporting just a frizzle of gray at sideburn level brings some satisfying gravity to his performance. Even so both Batman and Bruce Wayne mostly come off as sullen brats jealous of Supermans glowing skin and saviorlike demeanor. Meanwhile Cavill just looks noble and pained. Hes best in a scene with Amy Adams as his amour Lois Lane Shes just come home from a particularly rough assignment -- one whose effects will boomerang against her boyfriend -- and finally has the chance to sink into a hot bath. Cavills Clark Kent interrupts her solitude barging in with a sack of groceries (hes going to make dinner he announces) and a bouquet of flowers. He hands the troubled Lois a random tulip and when that fails to cheer to her up he steps into the water himself fully clothed. We dont see what happens next because we dont have to. For once Clark Kent is having some fun. Someone has to be. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Abrams Made a Secret Sequel All Stories >> Related Batman and Superman Brawl in Final Dawn of Justice Trailer Wonder Woman enters the arena Lex Luthor relishes the mayhem in explosive final spot Wait. Have I said too much? The spoiler-sensitive Digiverse is ready to rain down hell on any critic who dares reveal a single plot twist in Batman v. Superman Dawn of Justice a film thats filled to bursting with them. Its a risk just to point out that Ben Affleck steps in for Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman and that Henry Cavill is back as Clark Kent/Superman. So Ill keep this review aimed at what works and what doesnt and steer clear of the surprises in the script by David S. Goyer and Chris Terrio. Lets begin with Snyder who starts at over-the-top and then rockets to the stratosphere. Too much? Always. But when youre setting up the greatest gladiator match in the history of DC Comics subtlety is not your weapon of choice. Snyder (300 Watchman) cant touch Christopher Nolans artistry in the Dark Knight trilogy but hes still a hell of a showman. Snyder tear-asses through two hours and 31 minutes of head-spinning PG-13 mayhem (an expanded R-rated Ultimate Edition will be available later on home video). Snyder the director of the reboot of Dawn of the Dead uses Dawn of Justice to set up is a new era of Justice League epics which means youll be seeing cameos from Aquaman (Jason Momoa) The Flash (Ezra Miller) and Cyborg (Ray Fisher). But the focus here is on the two big kahunas. Cavill still has the square-jawed heroism of the son of Krypton down pat maybe too pat. So the advantage goes to Affleck who plays the disillusioned son of Gotham with a welcome streak of snarky humor. (I wish he hadnt adopted Bales Tom Waits growl whenever Batman wears the cowl but Affleck otherwise makes the role his own.) Playboy Bruce Wayne has butler Alfred (Jeremy Irons) in his corner. And Daily Planet reporter Clark Kent has his intrepid colleague and love interest Lois Lane (Amy Adams) on his side. Bruce and Clark meet at a reception hosted by Lex Luthor a junior Joker manically played by Jesse Eisenberg as a spoiled brat with billions to fuel his deity complex. Its Lex who wants to set the two heroes at each others throats -- God v mortal. Related 50 Most Anticipated Movies of 2016 From superhero movies and serious dramas to a new Star Wars movie the years must-sees I will cautiously point out that both Batman and Superman have mother issues. And that a U.S. senator (Holly Hunter) is the catalyst for a declaration of war. Its the Doomsday monster partly made of Kryptonite who brings Superman down to human level for the big fight with the Bat. Its a thrill to see these two freaks go at it. (The Batmobile is involved but I wont say how.) Just know that they lock horns in a dizzying display of showstopping special effects. An explosive highlight is the entrance of Wonder Woman (if you dont applaud when she appears the comic-book-loving child in you is dead). And Gadot a combat instructor in the Israeli army is a wonder indeed a true warrior. ""Is she with you?"" asks Superman. ""I thought she was with you"" counters Batman. That kind of quippy repartee bumps against the grain of a script that takes things very seriously especially the notion of illegal aliens like Superman taking over the world and the Trump-like wall Batman would like to build around them. No matter. Snyder juiced up by Hans Zimmers caffeinated score throws everything at the screen until resistance is futile. Better than Man of Steel but below the high bar set by Nolans Dark Knight Dawn of Justice is still a colossus the stuff that DC Comics dreams are made of for that kid in all of us who yearns to  see Batman and Superman suit up and go in for the kill.

With Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor and Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman directed by Zack Snyder (""Man of Steel"" ""300""). In theaters March 25. (Credit Warner Bros. Pictures) advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Two DC superheroes duke it out while the fates of Gotham and Metropolis hang in the balanceCAST Ben Affleck Henry Cavill Amy Adams Gal GadotLENGTH 233RATED PG-13 (Intense action-violence some bloodshed)BOTTOM LINE This overlong and humorless slugfest may knock you unconscious. Critics entering an advance screening of ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice"" were asked to sign a confidentiality agreement promising not to reveal ""plot or character"" developments before the films release. At least two spoilers however are worth revealing up front. The first concerns Ben Affleck whose casting as Batman raised a caps-lock outcry back in 2013. Surprise -- hes pretty good. With silvery temples and haunted eyes Affleck brings a welcome touch of vulnerability to a traditionally ice-cold character. His altered Batman voice is a low rumble that feels almost warm compared to Christian Bales threatening hiss in the ""Dark Knight"" films. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless Comedy Central upset over use of fake Colbert? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Messing Shelton call truce after spat over Trump Matt Damon says hes taking a year-long acting break The second spoiler is that in most other respects ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice"" is not a good movie. Its problems are built into its title which promises a big battle between two DC Comics good-guys but teams them back up for a future franchise ""Justice League."" To manage this hate-love flip-flop screenwriters Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer invent some very flimsy and mercurial motivations for our two heroes. Initially they view each other as dangerous vigilantes (pot meet kettle) though its Batman whos angriest. He blames Superman (Henry Cavill) for a city-wrecking fight against General Zod (see 2013s ""Man of Steel"") that leveled Bruce Waynes financial headquarters and killed countless people. MoviesThe movies you have to see in 2016 But didnt that battle take place in Supermans Metropolis? Did Wayne commute there from Gotham? Director Zack Snyder does his best to allow two versions of New York City to co-exist but the question nags. When Batman finally visits Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg distractingly twitchy) hes cheerfully told ""You ought to hop over the harbor more often."" So theres a ferry? advertisement | advertise on newsday These and other logical quibbles - people constantly know things they shouldnt or dont know things they should - prevent the film from making sense even on its own terms. Whats more the title-card bout turns out to be mere padding before another unrelated climax. No spoilers but it involves a mysterious woman (Gal Gadot) whose first name is presumably Wonder. (Speaking of women Amy Adams returns as Lois Lane in distressed-damsel mode.) Overlong underdeveloped and almost entirely humorless ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice"" may please die-hard fans by pitting two DC icons against each other. Everyone else may want to wait for the next Marvel movie.

Photo Clay Enos MOVIE REVIEW BATMAN V SUPERMAN DAWN OF JUSTICE Running time 151 minutes. Rated PG-13 (bloodless violence sensuality). Threatened in some form or other since 2002 ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice finally arrives to kick off the ever-lengthening ""summer"" movie season -- and a long series of planned DC superhero movies that hope to compete with Marvel. Director Zack Snyder may have introduced Henry Cavill as the latest Superman in ""Man of Steel in 2013 but this bloated sequel is very heavily weighted in favor of first-time Batman Ben Affleck. The film opens with Supes climactic battle against General Zod from ""Man of Steel as seen from the point of view of Batmans alter ego Bruce Wayne -- and it looks an awful lot like 9/11 at Ground Zero. Three years later Wayne/Batman still blames Superman for ""thousands of deaths at his companys skyscraper but mostly he seems jealous that the hero of Metropolis gets better press than the Gotham City vigilante. After all Supermans alter ego Clark Kent is a newspaper reporter and its in this guise that hes introduced to Wayne by Lex Luthor (a fiendishly entertaining Jesse Eisenberg playing a slightly more evil version of his Mark Zuckerberg in ""The Social Network). Ben AffleckPhoto Clay Enos After an hour or so of buildup Luthor finally engineers ""the greatest gladiator match of all time which turns out to be not only 20 minutes of anti-climax -- but the undercard for an even bigger and more ridiculous bout that probably should have ended up on the cutting-room floor. While ""300 maestro Snyder puts together some very striking scenes -- which may be enough for many fanboys -- they never really cohere into a whole. He literally throws in the kitchen sink in a film that frantically introduces characters and concepts while never clearly establishing the rules of the DC Comics universe. More problematically even on a comic-book movie level there is no credible sense of danger like there is in the ""Batman movies directed by Christopher Nolan (who takes a producing credit this time). The demolition of an iconic landmark carries no more weight here than in ""Independence Day. Part of this is due to Affleck who tries hard to project weary gravitas like his immediate predecessor Christian Bale as an older Batman but too often comes off like a self-loathing Oscar-winning writer-director cashing a big paycheck. Cavill is stuck with a character who spends far too much time reacting to others whether its to Batmans taunts or the romantic overtures of Lois Lane (Amy Adams). Constantly threatening to collapse from self-seriousness this epic has way too much of everything including CGI and Oscar winners up the wazoo (Jeremy Irons as Alfred Holly Hunter as a senator investigating Superman and even Kevin Costner in one of many ill-advised cameos). Gal Gadot has little to do as the first big-screen Wonder Woman until the torturously protracted ending of ""Dawn of Justice which is designed strictly to set up a planned Justice League blockbuster. I wont give away the big ""surprise but rest assured that like everything else here its telegraphed well in advance.

Unfortunately the other half of Zack Snyders epic-length superhero movie is so bloated that it blunts the effect of the good stuff. This live-action comic book movie with an overwrought running time of two hours and 31 minutes gets bogged down in too much existential angst too much deadly soul-searching and too much post-9/11 fear-mongering. Not that those elements should be eliminated -- because they are part of enriching the DC Extended Universe -- but director Snyder and screenwriters Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer layer it on too thick. This dreary darkness overwhelms us even during the excessive action scenes. So my three-star rating out of five is generous. Yet that brilliant stuff goes a long way. Including towards opening up the Universe to come in Snyders two Justice League instalments the Wonder Woman standalone movie now in post-production and a total of 11 movies by the end of 2020. There may even be a 12th if rumours of a new standalone Batman -- starring and directed by Ben Affleck -- come to fruition. Snyder nearly confirmed as much to me in a recent interview. In addition to establishing a new Bruce Wayne/Batman in Affleck Dawn of Justice gives us our first big-screen Wonder Woman in Gal Gadot. Hurrah It also briefly gives us ""found-footage"" glimpses of Barry Allen/The Flash (Ezra Miller) Victor Stone/Cyborg (Ray Fisher) and Arthur Curry/Aquaman (Jason Momoa). All for future movies. The new movie also merges the worlds of Batman and Superman into one sprawling physical space. So this is a DC geography lesson not a spoiler Gotham City where the Batman serves nightly as an angry vigilante is a twin city with Metropolis where Supermans alter ego Clark Kent still works as a mild-mannered reporter for the Daily Planet. The two cities are separated by a large bay (like San Francisco and Oakland). This is critical for the plot. The death and devastation we saw in Man of Steel (2013) when Superman saved Planet Earth from the ravages of his fellow aliens from Krypton left parts of Gotham City in ruins as well as swaths of Metropolis. Bruce Wayne suffered personally and his resentment has powered up enough for him to consider killing Superman thus eliminating what he perceives as a future threat of total annihilation. Hence the title Batman v Superman. Anything more about the story would invite spoilers. Instead here are the three things I like the most ... and the three things I hate the most Love-it 1 The casting Gal Gadot is great as the 5000-year-old Amazon princess Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince when disguised as a mere mortal. This augers well for the standalone Wonder Woman. When Godot finally shows up as Wonder Woman in the climax she saves us from some of the murky mess surrounding the death-battle --welcome relief from the macho bullying of the boys. Likewise casting Jesse Eisenberg as psychotic Lex Luthor is as devastatingly clever as it was unlikely. When Eisenbergs face is twitching with madness when his character is plotting Machiavellian twists Eisenbergs Luthor becomes a classic uber-villain. Also kudos go to Holly Hunter and Jeremy Irons in support roles. Love-it 2 Afflecks Bruce Wayne Bringing depth and new complexity Afflecks version of the Gotham City playboy takes him into middle-aged ennui. It is fascinating and sometimes moving. Love-it 3 As you would expect from a project reportedly costing 250 million the special effects are first-rate and the twin worlds of Metropolis and Gotham City make visual sense. On the large scale production designer Patrick Tatopoulos and cinematographer Larry Fong both work at the top of their game. Hate-it 1 Afflecks Batman There is nothing really wrong with his performance. But when he dons the armoured version of the Batsuit to battle Superman Affleck looks like a big bad clunky RoboCop. He become impersonal. Therefore no emotional impact. Hate-it 2 Doomsday When superheroes have to fight a common foe it would be more interesting if it did not look a slobbering mutated version of King Kong. Hate-it 3 The endless repetition of convoluted plot points about B amp; S -- all leading to the obvious climax -- is tiresome.

The invitation e-mail asked that no plot secrets or surprises be revealed and statements to that effect had to be signed at the screening itself which opened with two announcements one from director Zack Snyder himself (in a filmed introduction). I mention all of this because seriously does anyone go into a movie called ""Batman v Superman"" expecting any genuine surprises? And if the film does ever stray from the trite-and-true path of a superhero adventure does anyone in the audience think that take-backs wont follow in the inevitable sequel? See Chart Batman v Superman One Hero Crushes the Other at the Box Office Genuine surprise is the rock-bottom agenda item for this latest offering from the TimeWarner-DC Comics juggernaut since its been designed to launch the companys own set of superhero team-up and solo adventures following the trail blazed so successfully by the distinguished competition over at Disney/Marvel. Subsequently we get a little Batman origin story -- Martha Waynes pearls rain down on Gotham Citys Crime Alley just as sure as Rapunzels hair tumbles from her tower -- and a little empire-building as well. (The movie all but hits the pause button for about five minutes to lay the groundwork for sequels to come.) And what of the titles promised skirmish? That face-off between two comics legends becomes but one in a series of big things bashing into other big things which is what Snyder and writers Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer mistake for storytelling. The trio do manage to cough up an acceptable number of ooh-thats-cool moments and fans who will be satisfied with those will be satisfied with those but any other ideas and characters the movie might offer get lost in the rubble. Also Read Batman v Superman Red Carpet Canceled in London After Brussels Attacks The best notions in ""Batman v Superman"" come from elsewhere in the comics universe -- Alan Moores ""Watchmen"" (which Snyder unsuccessfully attempted to adapt in 2009) offered the concept that our world with superheroes in it would very quickly cease to be recognizable as our world and Frank Millers ""The Dark Knight Returns"" gave us an older more bitter Batman who would fight the Last Son of Krypton using high-tech armor laced with more than a touch of Kryptonite. This may be the first time that an on-screen Superman (Henry Cavill resuming his duties from Snyders ""Man of Steel"") has been asked to testify before Congress but much of the film revolves around the publics mixed response to this alien savior who does great deeds but also leaves disaster in his wake. ""BvS"" opens with the previous films climax as we see Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) speed through the streets of Metropolis as the Wayne Financial building collapses part of the massive collateral damage from Supermans battle with General Zod (Michael Shannon). Bruce/Batman tries to figure out a way to keep Superman in check but so does gazillionaire Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg in manic Mark Zuckerberg mode) and theyve both got their eye on a chunk of Kryptonite found in the wreckage of Zods spaceship in the Indian Ocean. Luthor of course has more nefarious plans afoot but hes being spied upon by both Bruce and the mysterious Ms. Prince (Gal Gadot) whos definitely more than she seems. Also Read Batman v Superman Is Fandangos Top Pre-Selling Superhero Movie Ever Thank goodness Ms. Prince turns out to be Wonder Woman who injects some real vitality into the sludgy superhero sameness. Its also worth nothing that shes the one female character with the possible exception of Soledad OBrien playing herself who isnt used in the film as a pawn or hostage which is about all we get from Amy Adams Lois Lane (whos apparently as addicted to stilettos as Bryce Dallas Howard in ""Jurassic World"") Diane Lanes Martha Kent or Holly Hunters all-too-brief turn as a Kentucky senator who squares off against Luthor. You can feel ""Batman v Superman"" occasionally reaching out toward more than what its corporate interests have dictated -- there are a few minutes of Affleck and Gadot verbally one-upping each other at a swanky society party promising a sexy caper movie that never emerges and Luthor occasionally stops being a cartoon when Eisenberg commits to some speeches about the nature of man and his gods and how a being can be all-good or all-powerful but never both. Also Read Batman v Superman Almost Featured Riddler and Joker Zack Snyder Says Such moments are fleeting however and are mere filigree on Snyders real agenda of blowing stuff up. As in ""Man of Steel"" great swaths of real estate get obliterated by our protagonists but it would appear that he heard the criticism that the previous film glibly traded on the horrors of 9/11 by showing ash-covered survivors crawling out of the ruins of Metropolis. This time theres always a supporting character (or Anderson Cooper) to tell us that the big bad battle is taking place in an area with no innocent bystanders. Theres an effort to contrast Cavills relatively wide-eyed Kal-El with Afflecks more cynical Bruce Wayne a 20-year veteran of the war on the streets but the movie relies more on our collective knowledge of these characters (and on two actors doing their best to squeeze some juice out of this script) than on dialogue and characterization. Jeremy Irons seems to be in a movie of his own as Alfred but his asides and eye-rolls over his boss behavior land in a way that the heroes big moments never do. Also Read Batman v Superman First Reactions Are In Fans Are Giddy Pleasantly Surprised The whole enterprise comes wrapped up in the usual trappings including a bombastic score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL that could use a lot more Drang and a lot less Sturm. An army of effects wizards make the impossible plausible but during one of the several climactic engagements Snyder allows the battle to descend to Michael Bay levels of visual cacophony where one cant be entirely sure who is doing what to whom and how and where all those beams of light are coming from. The DC Comics Cinematic Universe train has now officially left the station but lets hope that someone besides Snyder gets to steer lest the whole thing jump the track and plow through the middle of the depot.

VPCBruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) watches as a city crumbles in ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice.""(Photo Warner Bros. Entertainment)Director Zack Snyder proves he just might be the biggest fanboy of all by creating a superhero movie suitably epic for having Batman Superman Wonder Woman and all their derring-do.Is that a good thing for Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice though? Well not always in this massive though improved sequel ( out of four; rated PG-13; in theaters Friday) to Snyders Man of Steel. BvS does well laying groundwork for a cinematic universe that could hold an entire Justice League. But it unpacks too much material for even a 21/2-hour film leaving Dawn of Justice a superpowered jumble at times.USA TODAYHow much box-office punch will Batman v Superman have?But that takes a backseat to the joys of watching Gal Gadots awesome Wonder Woman smile gloriously in the middle of a fight Ben Affleck turning in a strong take on an older Dark Knight and his alter ego Bruce Wayne and a story about two orphans.Batman plays a major role from the start as a quick recounting of his origin leads to Bruce driving into the 9/11-type destruction of Metropolis and seeing the carnage wrought by Supermans Man of Steel battle against Zod.Fast-forward 18 months and Superman becomes part of another incident saving his love Lois Lane (Amy Adams). Enoughs enough for three folks Sen. June Finch (Holly Hunter) a congresswoman who wants to hold Superman accountable; Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) a xenophobic villain planning to annihilate this alien interloper; and Batman whos waging his own war against criminals while figuring out what to do about the Man of Steel.Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) lives for battle in ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice.""

For those wondering why these two have to fight there is a very good storyline reason for the two frenemies coming to blows and in the directors action-packed movie resume (300 Watchmen) that faceoff and their inevitable alliance with Wonder Woman against Lexs vicious monster Doomsday vault to the top of Snyders best-told fight sequences.USA TODAY2016 brings Batman Superman and the Dawn of a new superhero universeHenry Cavill is again a solid Superman (and Clark Kent) even more the second time though Affleck and Gadot are really special in their debuts. Whether skulking around in an evening dress or brandishing bulletproof bracelets in costume Gadot proves to be just as entertaining and watchable as either of the headlining heroes.Afflecks Batman is a surprisingly emotional one. A few scenes showcase a strong even flirty chemistry between him and Gadot rivaling that of Cavill and Adams and of the cinematic Caped Crusaders over the years Affleck seamlessly moves between Batman and Bruce Wayne.BvS will please those either waiting for the two main players to lock horns on a movie screen or those whove just been pining for Wonder Woman forever.

March 22 2016 | 0300PM PT Zack Snyder paves the way for a DC Comics universe on the big screen with an exhilarating scattered showdown between two comicbook titans. Who would win in a fight Batman or Superman? Could the Flash outrun Superman? Could Superman craft a boulder so heavy even he couldnt lift it? While ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice"" ostensibly seeks to tackle the first of those evergreen schoolyard hypotheticals its the third that ends up proving the biggest litmus test for director Zack Snyder. Tasked with colliding the two most archetypal of American superheroes while also answering critics of his last outing ""Man of Steel"" and perhaps most importantly paving the way for an extended DC Comics universe of films on which much of Warner Bros. future bottom line relies Snyder has set a Sisyphean task for himself. That this very long very brooding often exhilarating and sometimes scattered epic succeeds as often it does therefore has to be seen as an achievement and worldwide box office should be sufficiently lucrative to ensure future installments proceed on schedule. But amidst all the grueling work of saving the world and shouldering a franchise toward the heights it would be nice to see these heroes and this series take a few more breathers to enjoy the view. Proving that the placement of names in the title isnt simply alphabetical the first few reels of ""Batman v Superman"" are dominated by the Caped Crusader with controversial casting Ben Affleck stepping quite comfortably into the role. That the film opens with yet another operatic depiction of the young Bruce Waynes most formative trauma is perhaps unavoidable -- Thomas and Martha Wayne have been killed so many times in so many different media that their deaths may as well be one of the Stations of the Cross -- but our first glimpse of the adult Wayne is hardly standard issue. Taking a civilian-level view of the cataclysmic destruction of Metropolis that ended ""Man of Steel"" on a contentious note we watch as Wayne attempts to remotely evacuate his own Metropolitan Wayne Enterprises skyscraper crippled by a wayward Superman (Henry Cavill) as he battles with General Zod just outside the frame. Despite his mad drive through the battle-torn streets Wayne arrives just in time to watch horrified as a friendly security guard loses his legs and a young girl becomes an orphan. Setting Wayne up as the films initial conscience is one of Snyders most interesting gambles especially as his Batman quickly evolves into the most morally ambiguous iteration of the character yet seen on film. More than willing to shoot brutalize and kill if the need arises this Batman is still a figure of mystery in Gotham and Snyder refrains from showing us the character in full cowl until surprisingly late in the game. Related Box Office Batman v Superman to Soar to 300 Million-Plus Global Debut Fortunately Afflecks Wayne -- here sporting salt-and-pepper temples and all the baggage of a man who as faithful butler Alfred (Jeremy Irons) notes ""got too old to die young and not for want of trying"" -- is a winningly cranky charismatic presence even when out of costume. Diving headfirst into the sorts of detective work that Christopher Nolans Batman trilogy often short-shrifted Wayne casts a skeptical eye on Superman while investigating a mysterious underworld figure named White Portuguese his tracks traced by an equally mysterious woman (Gal Gadot). Meanwhile Superman has hardly recovered from the fallout of his chaotic battle with Zod when controversy strikes yet again. Though hes been welcomed as a savior by most of Metropolis in the course of rescuing Lois Lane (Amy Adams) from a terrorist interview gone awry hes blamed for the deaths of several African villagers. This attracts the scrutiny of the crusading southern Senator Finch (Holly Hunter) who heads up a Congressional Superman Committee disturbed by the Kryptons exercise of unilateral power. She gains an uneasy ally in a cheeky young industrialist named Alexander ""Lex"" Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg retaining his Zuckerbergian misanthropy from ""The Social Network"" and his stringy Cobainian hair from ""American Ultra"") who hopes to seduce her into allowing him to import a mysterious glowing green substance discovered in the Indian Ocean. Scarfing Jolly Ranchers quoting Nabokov and showing up to formal events wearing a white blazer and sneakers Eisenberg tackles Luthor as the brogrammer from hell a chattily malevolent presence who provides the only real moments of levity in the film. Juggling all of these strands while steadily beating the drum toward the battle promised in the title Snyder sometimes loses track of his various allegories. Scripters Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer provide kernels of philosophical and theological quandaries throughout while their nods toward contemporary political debates are more complex than the scattered visual gags (such as an anti-Superman protester waving an ""Aliens Are Un-American"" placard) might seem to imply. Yet the essential clash of ideologies promised by the central conflict -- vigilante justice vs. self-sacrificing restraint night vs. day Dionysus vs. Apollo -- never develops quite as forcefully as it should and the life-or-death battle between the two icons ultimately comes down to a series of misunderstandings. Related Batman v Superman U.S. Premiere Photos While ""Batman v Supermans"" Dark Knight may be more of a pure punisher than some fans would prefer Snyders conception of the character at least feels fully formed. Superman remains something of a work-in-progress. (If nothing else its strange to see Clark Kent cast a more brooding figure than Bruce Wayne.) Daily Planet scenes are even more perfunctory this time around and Adams Lois has plenty to do but little to say. As a pure visual spectacle however ""Batman v Superman"" ably blows the hinges off the multiplex doors and editor David Brenner does excellent work to comprehensibly streamline the chaos capably captured by d.p. Larry Fong. Composers Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL are again key assets here with Gadots theme in particular proving quite infectious. Snyder largely tamps down his penchant for hyper-stylized combat imagery until the end when he stages a series of galactic battles that take style notes from sources as varied as classic WWE rumbles and Harryhausen creature features. As overblown as the lengthy showdown might become Snyder gets closer than ever before to the chiaroscuro palette of classic comics and even if his scrupulous efforts to avoid reopening ""Man of Steels"" collateral damage debates are a bit on the nose at least hes clearly received the message.

Reply Max Sherman says April 12 2016 at 1143 am Dear Mr. Barker Your review stood out to me among those as it is in a heavy minority. You are one of a very few to have an overall positive opinion in regards to Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice. I seek to add to the conversation and point out some personal curiosities without spoiling key plot of the movie for the benefit of those who have yet to watch. Batman v. Superman fails in that its villains fail. Ostensibly the film has a single major villain Lex Luther but one can expand this to say Superman as well as a tertiary villain I will not name. All three are riddled with holes. First Lex who you mention passingly and without praise or disent who is the worst offender. Setting aside that he is in no way similar to his comic book basis (an issue for a separate time) he is simply done poorly. Victim to the villainy for villainys sake issue he hipsterizes and twitches his way through the movie. His small and odd form assumingly an attempt to counter the more powerful figures drawn by batman and superman does not fit an imposing bill among these fighting gods. Superman the villain in the eyes of Batman and some of the American people while ethically interesting does not hold up. The explanations that are given for how Luther makes people believe in Supermans villainy are weak to nonsensical and the ethical dilemmas that could make him interesting are really just set dressing as the movie moves at a mile a minute to jam pack its long run time. Both the third villain as well as the villain hinted at for future films is just cinematic overkill. Again attempting to avoid details the film butchers one of the most famous Superman stories to have been written to exist as a capstone. The character becomes nothing more than a punching bag without motivation history or anything to give it weight other than it being scary looking (which is barely the case). What possible time they could have used to flesh out this extra villain was stolen by a huge swath of time dedicated to setting up the next films villain. The film failed because it wanted to give the characters so many challenges that it did not give them any one good one. They may have been worthy of a fight scene but not worthy of the ethical elements that the film claimed to deal with. Neither Superman or Batman are centered around fighting bad guys but why they fight and how the world responds to them. That is their story but this was not their story. Reply JMBeach says March 31 2016 at 545 am I have been a fan of comic book heros since I was a child. I am now thirty one year old and batman and superman has always been my favorite. I am not a movie critic nor do I work for Warner Brothers or any other comic books or branch of the DC world. I am just a simple everyday fan who went to see a movie that pertains to his favorite super heros. Speaking as a fan I would like to say that batman vs superman is one of the most poorly done movie Ive ever seen in a long time. It look like it was put together in a hurry. The movie jumps from place to place and for batman being the worlds most favorite detective he is actually very stupid. You put batman and superman together for the promotion of Justice League one and two. The ratings are going to be high when it first comes out especially if its about peoples two favorite super heros. People have been waiting to see it for a long time. My point is its going to be high when it first comes out whether its good or bad because people dont know what they are going to see; So you cant go by the ratings when it first comes out. Of course its going to be high Its Batman and Superman dah After the disappointment of Dawn of Justice all I can say is I am hoping for Man of Steel 2 to make up for the disappointment of Batman versus Superman. Stop comparing the movies to the politics of the times. Thank goodness for wonder woman she is truly a team player. Something that batman and superman did not portray. I could not keep still in my seat because of my favorite heroes beating one another to a pulp Oh by the way you missed the boat on your choice of Lex Luthor. He was awkward and look like he did not belong. Bravo a spectacular failure and how sad I hope the movies in the future pertaining to super heroes are better and more exciting. The actor that played superman is contracted for four movies and man of steel and dawn of justice was two movies and justice league one and two will be the other two movies and that will make up the four. I strongly suggest that you contract them for at least one more movie so you can make man of steel 2 and this will make up hopefully for the bitter disappointment that Dawn of Justice was.

Reply Superman fan says March 26 2016 at 626 pm I just saw the movie .. I thought it was a very good movie .. critics are always trying to read to much into a movie. Reply Batman fan says March 26 2016 at 314 pm I loved the batman suit and enjoyed Affleck as the Bat. The fight scenes were incredible and I will definitely go see it again. I could do without dream sequences but if thats all I have bad to say then I think Zack Snyder do a good job. I feel like the dream sequences may make sense after a sequel. I think the critics are being way too harsh but the money the film makes will say it all. Reply Stephanie McPherson Grohol says March 26 2016 at 249 pm My husband and I went to see Batman V Superman and we actually enjoyed it. We formed OUR own opinions and we thought it was good. Yes there was violence but that is expected. Yes there is a fight between Batman and Superman but it is worth waiting for. And seeing Wonder Woman is a great addition. We get everything we want in a superhero movie and more. I think adding Ben Affleck as Batman was a great plan. He more than redeems himself after Daredevil. I think it is our own reviews and opinions that matter...not the critics. We are the ones who go see the movies and pay our own money. If we like movie then we like it and give good reviews. If we dont then there are bad reviews. All in all it was a good movie if a bit sad at the end. But we all know he will return in future movies. Cant wait for the next movies to come out....in the DC world. Go see the movie and judge for yourself not what the critics are saying. It is a good movie. Reply Kurt says March 25 2016 at 744 pm This film had disaster written all over it when it was announced back in 2013. Anybody who followed the production is not shocked by the terrible reviews. It was okay when it was a Batman/Superman but cramming the DC universe in this movie was garbage. Instead making a good movie they are focused on this universe garbage. Reply Charlie Hobbs says March 25 2016 at 954 pm Hated Ben Aflac as The Daredevil but loved him as The Batman. I usually buy and wear Superman shirts but now looking to purchase Batman shirts. Seems to be a lot of haters out there for this movie but for me I Loved it Cyborg. Wow Wonderman Oh yah Not sure about Aquaman. Reply Sara says March 25 2016 at 321 pm WT...Neyl Degrasse Tyson What are you doing there man???? hahahaha The worst superhero movie Ive seen so far Reply Bobby says March 25 2016 at 1159 am Nice puff piece review. This was the worst movie since Troy. Directed for shit. Ive never seen such poor performances from any of these actors. Attempts to build connections to characters were so flat I wanted to leave the theater I was so insulted. Whatever geniuses approved the casting script and actually released this steaming turd should be fired. Snyder 300 and watchmen were great everything else youve done since is shit. Congratulations you have destroyed a potentially endless cinematic world. Way to go Fuckers you not only killed superman and Batman but all the DC franchises that could lead have been amazing. Reply Meribela Savior says March 25 2016 at 144 am ""Snyder gets closer than ever before to the chiaroscuro palette of classic comics"". You clearly dont know what Chiaroscuro art is and you clearly have not even bother to open a ""classic"" comic book before to realize they are opposite of chiaroscuro. You seem to believe that making this movie darker and mostly in the dark conveys a sense of chiaroscuro. The reference to the ""classic"" comics is most likely from the heavy shading used back. This does not convey or resemble any type of chiaroscuro art. Once colors were used this then made the comics completely opposite with heavy use of bright and colorful shades. Please dont sound so fcking ignorant by trying too hard to sound smart. I respect Christopher Hitchens and his excellent use of language but you youre just a pathetic hack. Reply Teevee O (mewt_point) says March 24 2016 at 1109 pm This had to be the best COMIC BOOK movie to date. I love the risk it took and how well it actually is introducing a huge franchise. There is no better way to do it this is the comic book movie we needed for so long. DC did another game changer for damn sure Its only a matter of time until Marvel stops recycling plots and copies DC again. Reply AJL says March 24 2016 at 721 pm The writer of this article seems to not understand the story behind the fight between batman vs superman...it is all about misunderstandings...unlike Marvels Civil War which is about clashing ideologies between Captain America and Iron Man. Batman and Superman face each other again in the future but during this point in time it is about misunderstandings that lead to the coming together and forming the Justice League. Reply Marc says March 26 2016 at 617 pm Thats because the writing and directing of this mess DID NOT MAKE IT CLEAR. Bad. And no one really cares. Its just a kids film after all. Reply BK says March 24 2016 at 423 pm Variety may as well just fold up its tent if theyre now having this kind of reviewer - what are this guys credentials? He cant really write he doesnt know how to be clear and anyone ANYONE who would say this mess of a movie is in any way good should not be reviewing for a trade paper. Reply Sam says April 22 2016 at 1251 pm How pathetic- to assume someone who likes a certain film shouldnt be reviewing movies. Sounds to me like youre just hopping on this unavailing pretentious bandwagon. Reply Jacques Strappe says March 24 2016 at 253 pm Guano vs Supermano Reply joshua adams says March 24 2016 at 130 pm Mr. Snyder and Mr. Nolan Its clear here in these early days prior to the release of Batman v. Superman that the outcry of fans over the last few years to not destroy the DC Cinematic Universe apparently fell on deaf ears and that you continued to trudge along and do your own thing regardless. I think back to 2013 and 2014 when movies like this and indeed the idea of a larger DC Cinematic Universe were being discussed in all the relative media podcasts newsfeeds network news etc. The early precedents being set by the DCCU creators and developers (who you now represent) were baffling to us as fans. I am reminded of early reports of a No Jokes policy in response to the poorly received Green Lantern film or the We refuse to be like Marvel attitude towards a connected TV and Film universe and I beg of you this simple question; ""Hows that workin out for ya?"" You see you as producer and director and overall controlling parties of (at the very least) the cinematic portion of this universe missed the point; which is how do we entertain our fans. You remember those? The people that buy the comics purchase the movie tickets influence their friends and families to buy the comics and purchase the movie tickets. Who spend thousands of dollars on merchandise and stand in line for everything from movie premieres to action figures? Those guys/gals? Well you pissed in their faces when you put in place silly edicts regarding how your universe would be created and moderated. We told you not to and then told each other; ""Ah theyre just playing theyre not really gonna do that....right?"" Fans want interconnectivity. It wasnt a purely Disney/Marvel idea but rather Disney/Marvel adopted it because they had the forethought to start world building and weaving according to what their fan base WANTED to see. They realized early that fans wanted to see shows and films that played off each other and featured cross overs and interconnected in a way that was similar to...well to comics. But much like your comics universe has failed to maintain any sort of continuity (despite having some of the best characters and story arcs in history) you chose to keep your nose in the air like an arrogant teenager and trudge on despite what your fans were telling you. In your defense there are many others as equally responsible that simply dont have the spotlight that you two do (Geoff J. and Kevin T. we are looking right at you) but as you have chosen (or rather been chosen) to represent the creative direction of the films and WB/DCCU as a whole then you are going to bear the brunt of the retaliation that we TOLD you would be forthcoming. Early reviews of BvS are heartbreakingly sad featuring words and phrases like too dark too violent overly brooding taking itself far too seriously and my personal favorite absolutely abysmal. And I am here to tell you why. Those fans that you ignored? Those people arent just how was it one DC associate put it? ...Bottom feeding fanboys sitting at home in their mothers basement complaining about how we should govern and steer a potential multibillion dollar franchise of course were not going to take that seriously No they are bankers lawyers politicians engineers and almost every nook and cranny in between including critics. Yeah thats right. Those same fanboys that you sneered at and ignored are sitting in judgement of your film early on right now and telling the rest of the world that the DC Cinematic Universe is doomed based on this second foray in the franchise. And the sad part is it will absolutely without a doubt do damage to other properties from other writers/directors/actors who plan to feature in future properties in this franchise. It is undoubtedly too late for films like Wonder Woman and perhaps even the first Justice League film for you to make this realization change your ways and begin to make the kind of changes to ALL of your properties (Television and Film) in such a way as to swing this all back up but the least you could do is admit to it early on. Take credit for the failure and the lack of attentiveness to fans needs and start to make amends. Do you want to succeed in the same way that Marvel has? Or at the very least in the same way Fox has? (Sorry Fox but you really are the middle child here) Do you want to get out of this corner your painting yourself into? Then start with interconnectivity in your TV and Film universes. It is after all so easy for you to do and the solution for unfucking this situation is sitting right in front of you. I mentioned earlier that DC comics has always had an issue with continuity but somehow every few years manages to shake things up with some universe altering event like an Infinity-Something or a Flashpoint and manages to reel things in just enough to be interesting again. Hell Mark Waid gave you pretty much the ALLTIME solution with Elseworlds. Let these next few films play out and use your existing Television properties to begin to lay the foundation in story for something coming. Something big and universe-altering. Then...do it. Shake it all up but keep your players. Keep the Steven Amells and the Ben Afflecks and the Henry Cavills and for Gods sake the Matt Ryans but paint them in a new interconnected light. Your options at that point will be endless and only as far as the imagination of your writers can take you. It wont limit but rather it will expand the canvass that they are capable of creating on. Secondly and maybe even most importantly in some ways...ditch this dark dystopian outlook you currently have in the film portion of the franchise. In the famous words of Heath Ledger; ""Why so Serious?? And for the most part I am talking to you Zack. Not every film needs to be as dire as 300 or as dark and deconstructing as Watchmen. Yeah we get it thats your bread and butter but if thats the case then maybe youre not the guy for any job other than Batman or maybe even some of the darker DC characters. Which brings me to you Christopher...find the right talent for the project. Its ok to do some movies in the DCCU with levity and some should be dark but its a matter of finding the right person for the job and not just sticking to the dark grey to black end of the scale. If you cant then get out of the way and let someone else take the reins. I highly recommend Bruce Timm or Paul Dini. Its not too late to get your heads out of your asses and turn this thing around. If you dont the DCCU will be a flash in the pan and will not survive the next 2 years worth of productions TV or otherwise with the exception of a few gems like Arrow and Flash. Which now that I brought those two up; can you guess why they have been SOOOOOO successful on the CW? Interconnectivity and a sense of humor. Not to mention a constantly fluctuating backdrop of both the brightest of days and the darkest of nights. Ha See what I did there?

Superman has never harmed anyone or taking any life and hes always done the right thing hes upstanding so why put him up against Batman as a villain period when Batman is the villain he thinks its his job to take down Superman for what he perceived as Superman being a danger to Earth.

Rather than focusing on a cataclysmic showdown between pop cultures most famous men in tights Zack Snyders flashy cacophonous follow-up to 2013s ""Man of Steel"" is basically one long teaser for the next installment. Next falls ""Justice League Part One"" has plenty of plot details set in motion by this dreary spectacle but doesnt fare as well in the department of good ideas. As its title implies ""Batman v Superman"" plays like a mashup of things weve seen before. Which isnt to say the movie lacks some modicum of intrigue at least insofar as it further explores the massive universe of DC Comics properties. But thats also its Achilles Heel. So obviously beholden to the next stage in its story ""Batman v Superman"" barely has the patience to linger on its current one. It begins with an admittedly compelling hook by offering an opposing perspective on the climax from the last installment a fiery battle between Superman and his evil Kryptonian foe Zod that reduced Metropolis to smoldering mess of metal. Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck more stone-faced and disinterested than usual) watches in horror from the ground managing at the last minute to salvage one would-be victim (Scoot McNairy). The shift in point of view cannily acknowledges criticism of ""Man of Steel"" for taking its iconic hero in such a dark direction. Even Batman cant believe it. And we know that hes Batman of course before he even dons the cape. Waynes murky backstory -- millionaire playboy parents killed as a child overly obsessed with bats you know the drill -- comes and goes in a slo-mo opening sequence acknowledging his mythological origin story without wasting too much time on it. Thats about as deep as this movie drills into psychology before it rushes into a series of effects-driven battles shadowy threats and half-baked plot twists. Its a spectacularly empty vision that fans already gleaned from the marketing. Eighteen months after Supermans widely publicized role in the Metropolis disaster Batmans lurking around Gotham doing his usual demon-in-the-shadows thing. Naturally the two masked avengers dont trust each other and leering rich brat Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) picks up on the tension. Gesticulating wildly underneath a Cheshire cat grin Eisenbergs cartoonish Luther comes across as a child eager to play his toys. He epitomizes the simplified gravitas of Snyders filmmaking which once reflects an attempt to imitate Christopher Nolans grim style without its substance. Instead Batman and Supermans inherent distrust for each other never quite adds up as their initially tense exchanges never quite dig into their motivations. These muscular bad boys know how to solve problems with brawn but cant seem to grasp the concept of diplomacy. In any case much of the story surrounding the pair reeks of the usual routine. Intrepid reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) continues her obsession with Superman while maintaining business as usual with Clark Kent now a romantic interest. (The talented actress alternating expressions of bafflement and fear suggest the ""one for them one for me"" philosophy at its height.) Superman copes with a skeptical media (including goofy cameos from the likes of Anderson Cooper and Charlie Rose). Eventually a damsel in distress sets in motion the much-awaited showdown but its little more than a handful of punches before the grand finale when Wonder Woman essentially shows up out of nowhere to aid in a final smackdown. Then comes an abrupt final twist that so clearly sets the stage for future installments that it may as well end with a link to buy more tickets. In other words ""Batman v Superman"" has reasons for being unfinished but thats particularly frustrating given the established potential of the material. Fans of Frank Millers quintessential eighties series ""The Dark Knight Returns"" will recall the astounding climax in which the same characters wrestled for supremacy against far more engaging reasons for the pair to face each other. Devoid of such inspired rationales ""Batman v Superman"" reduces its premise to the worlds most expensive childs play. But Snyders an accomplished stylist who can at least make the dumbest movies justify their heft. His ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake remains his best effort by reducing the formulaic premise to a series of tense sequences. ""Legend of the Guardians The Owls of GaHoole"" similarly energized the animated fantasy genre by increasing the intensity of its action. Likewise filled with motion-heavy sequences rich in light and color ""Batman v Superman"" doesnt lack for inspired visuals. The palette is rich with engaging contrasts. Superman drifts in space against a rainbow-colored earth; the hulkish doomsday monster that Luther dreams up looks like a Golem on steroids. The climax erupts in a symphony of neon light and shadows. At no point however do those elements imbue its spectacle with brains. David S. Goyer and Chris Terrios script offers plenty of weighted dialogue about playing gods being gods and killing gods but such pontifications can only take the one-note premise so far. Engineered to give audiences what they want Snyders by-the-book treatment assumes they want a watered-down treatment that never rises above the call of duty even with its big twists. Some viewers may just roll with it but they ought to consider the possibility that theyve been had. Trailers tease the premise of ""Batman v Superman"" with the catchy hashtag WhoShouldWin but the movie inadvertently suggests that the real topic is WhoShouldCare. Grade C- ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice"" opens nationwide this Friday. This Article is related to Reviews and tagged Batman v.

His only choice was whether to allow the battle to continue or to put down the rabid dog that Zod had become. 2nd the motivations ARE clearly unpacked just not explained to the other party. Supes thinks Bats is abusing the rights of criminals and Bats thinks Superman is a threat to all people rather than a Hero. 3rd WW didnt show up out of nowhere. Fans know that Diana Prince IS WW and she had seen the news reports of what was happening. Lastly the one note you mention is actually a note on the human condition. Lex bristles at the ""God"" of Superman just as many do the idea of God in general and for the same reasons because they feel that God ""allowed"" X or Y to happen to them. The author criticizes the simplicity of Zac Snyders effort but misses SO much of this simple film?

Its why nobody older than 11 should care at all. But in a culture in which adults turn Harry Potter into an unprecedented bestseller this is just more juvenile escapism. That adults will go and see.

Reply Leon Raymond Mitchell May 12 2016 527 pm JUSTIN I agree 100% thats why the premise of the set for this fight is one I dont get. The fight should last 11 seconds even with all of Batmans Gadgets. Superman is beyond and beyond beyond Reply Justin May 12 2016 527 pm Superman is above all that. He sees earth people as lost children. Superman also knows nothing can stop him. If a 2 years old was screaming at you you wouldnt punch him. Reply Martin Thopson May 12 2016 527 pm Terrible editing... painful to read. Why is it so hard for ""professionals"" to get a decent bit of copy out? Reply Rebar May 12 2016 527 pm This movie isnt great but this review is doing it a massive disservice. Star Wars had the same responsibility of setting up a world for sequels and it took less risks than BVS (Han was a necessity not a risk). You dont touch on a lot of the ideas they explore (like the severe abuse of power by men vs. how women handle conflict) and Wonder Woman barely gets a mention Sure the directing is heavy handed a lot of the time but its not awful. Affleck was a great casting choice and its the best Cavills been in ages. Its a great feminist piece too btw. Much better than Mad Max. Reply Reeldummy May 12 2016 527 pm Okay Superman can travel at speed of light. So that he does and like in the 1960d BAM POW. Game over Guess superman either dumber we all are dumb Reply CJ May 12 2016 527 pm If you please its ""Luthor"" not ""Luther.""

Since it was first announced in 2013 the movie wasnt merely hyped as the launching pad for DCs expanded universe (bringing in the likes of Gal Gadots Wonder Woman Aquaman the Flash etc.). It would also serve up a superhero smackdown for the ages the Dark Knight vs. the Man of Steel. As these things go its hard to imagine a bigger event. Dawn of Justice is big all right. The brawls are busy and brutal the story is sprawling in scope the effects are an embarrassment of pixels and the performances (well some of them at least) couldnt be broader. If its just size youre after you wont be disappointed. But at this point in Hollywoods superhero cycle is that really enough? Snyder has built his career on the supposition that it is. In films like 300 Watchmen Sucker Punch and Man of Steel hes proved to be the kind of filmmaker who cranks every knob as far to the right as it will go. Modulation economy and nuance may not be his thing but at least his movies always look like a billion bucks. And this one does too. GALLERY Inside the Superhero Grudge Match in Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice As every Batman story must Dawn of Justice opens with a flashback to Bruce Waynes defining childhood trauma the murder of his parents. While weve all seen this tragedy rendered before whether in the panels of a comic or on screen Snyder gives it the haunting visual power of a primal myth. And the good news is Ben Affleck is a solid successor to Christian Bale even if hes a better Bruce Wayne than Batman. His innate air of cockiness syncs up perfectly with Waynes spoiled playboy-scion persona. The movie kicks off with the twin cities of Gotham and Metropolis trying to make sense of the destructive arrival of Superman (the film picks up on the heels of 2013s Man of Steel). As Henry Cavills square-jawed hero grapples with his role as a protector of both mankind and Amy Adams Lois Lane Afflecks brooding vigilante (along with confidant Alfred now played by Jeremy Irons) wrestles with the question of whether Superman is a friend or foe. Enter Jesse Eisenbergs Lex Luthor to manipulate our dueling heroes anxieties and play both sides against the middle pitting them against each other. RELATED How Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice maps out DCs movie universe I get that this mano a supermano story line is a sacred text among comic-book aficionados but Dawn of Justice doesnt do the tale any favors. Its overstuffed confusing and seriously crippled by Eisenbergs over-the-top performance. As the megalomaniac tech mogul hell-bent on bringing our heroes to their knees the actor is a grating cartoon of manic motormouth tics. He might as well be wearing a buzzing neon sign around his neck that says ""Crazy Villain."" (If you dont want to know anything more about his nefarious plot stop reading.) Luthor schemes to weaponize some Kryptonian relics left behind by General Zod in Man of Steel and create a rampaging monster named Doomsday that to my eyes resembles a giant turd. Dawn of Justice starts off as an intriguing meditation about two superheroes turning to an all-too-human emotion hatred out of fear of the unknown. Two and a half hours later it winds up somewhere very far from that--but at the same time all too familiar. Its another numbing smash-and-bash orgy of CGI mayhem with an ending that leaves the door open wide enough to justify the next 10 installments. Is it too late to demand a rematch?

TWITTER 3/25/2016 The two superheroes face off in Zack Snyders action extravaganza the first in a proposed series of ""DC Extended Universe"" tentpoles. ""Nobody cares about Clark Kent taking on the Batman"" the Daily Planets editor dismissively remarks early on in the lumbering steamroller that is Batman v. Superman Dawn of Justice. But Warner Bros. devoutly prays that this sentiment is not the case. The studio has a great deal riding on this battle of culturally imperishable superheroes the launchpad for its proposed series of ""DC Extended Universe"" tentpoles that it hopes will prove viable rivals to Marvels vaunted cinematic gold mine of comic book figures turned film franchises. Opening this weekend on roughly 4000 screens domestically and 30000 worldwide this dramatically dark and physically gigantic venture is estimated to need to haul in 1 billion at the very least to justify itself financially and pave the way for the flood of WB/DC outings already set for release over the next four years. With significantly stronger international than domestic results likely it may well earn its keep. But after Man of Steel three years ago the studio had to know what it was getting with director Zack Snyder; the film may be imposing but its not fun. The main issue facing the writers of a superhero smackdown like this is concocting a reason why given all the evil out there they have to fight each other -- as well as in this case coming up with a way to level the playing field when one hero is essentially immortal and the other is just a really buff rich guy with a costume and lots of gizmos. Screenwriters Chris Terrio (Argo) and David S. Goyer (all three of Christopher Nolans Dark Knight blockbusters) have sort of solved this by devising ways to make Superman more frequently vulnerable than hes ever been before. But the villain here Jesse Eisenbergs Lex Luthor is so intensely annoying that very early on you wish Batman and Superman would just patch up their differences and join forces to put the squirrelly rascal out of his and our misery. The story does take an epic rangy perspective as the long setup jumps from one far-flung locale to another to establish pockets of evil while also dramatizing Bruce Waynes backstory here conceived as seeing his parents gunned down in the street after emerging from a theater showing Excalibur. Seemingly disconnected worldwide events -- Metropolis being destroyed as a huge spacecraft with claws hangs overhead Lois Lane (Amy Adams) on assignment in Africa criminals threatening wider destruction with a dirty bomb -- are mixed in with Bruce (Ben Affleck fitting the role just fine) brooding over his place in the world and his legacy to which his butler Alfred (Jeremy Irons who could use more to do) replies with perhaps the films best line ""Even youve grown too old to die young."" The solemn grandiose atmosphere is severely disrupted by Luthor portrayed by Eisenberg as a privileged tech guru who makes the actors take on Mark Zuckerberg look like the epitome of style and manners. Loaded with vocal tics and gushing with smarmy ripostes and threats the character is loathsome without an ounce of insidious charm; if the legacy of the studios Dark Knight films might have suggested anything it should have been in the area of great villains but here there is just a great vacuum. For his part Batman is provided with plentiful backstory and psychology but the mature character as written never comes into full bloom; all the same one can look ahead with some hope to Affleck in the role in future installments. Cavill is also likeable enough but again hamstrung by the twisty convoluted inventions designed to limit his abilities during long stretches. Stylistically its clear that Snyder felt the weight of responsibility entailed in setting the visual and tonal template for Warners DC universe to come; with all the ominous foreboding and hues much darker than the director worked with on Man of Steel one senses him and cinematographer Larry Fong (in their fourth collaboration although Fong did not shoot Man of Steel) figuratively looking over their shoulders in the direction of hovering executive producer Nolan to make sure its all black and bleak enough. This applies as well to Patrick Tatopoulos envelopingly gloomy production design as well as to the score by Nolan regular Hans Zimmer and the latters collaborator here Junkie KC who have come up with a number of very effective musical passages that seriously enhance the mood of impending doom. The look of the bat suit keeps evolving and Michael Wilkinsons costumes impressively meet a wide variety of requirements. Based on these proceedings its hard to say what ought to happen between Batman and Superman in the future even indeed if they actually should share the screen again. Obviously if they fight it would always have to be to a draw so for the most part they should collaborate. If Warners does end up making more stand-alone Batman and Superman films the most enjoyable solution would probably be to have the superheroes drop in for surprise visits to the others world from time to time just to help out. As other DC characters are rotated into the Warner Bros. big-screen world its to be hoped that they are introduced and integrated into the flow of events more gracefully than is Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) here. Its as if the filmmakers have simply thrown up their hands at the challenge; after having been briefly glimpsed earlier shes tossed into the epic final battle between the two heroes and a raging giant that burns as hot as the sun only to quickly assume battle posture with her sword and shield. Good luck with that. Production companies Atlas Entertainment/Cruel and Unusual Films Distributor Warner Bros.

Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com3/22/2016 Editor rating 2 In Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice the Dark Knight and the Man of Steel duke it out and the audience loses. Ever since director Zack Snyder first announced the movie at the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con the frenzy of anticipation has reached Star Wars proportions. Here finally was the film that would unite the two most iconic superhero characters in all of comic-book history and pit them against each other. The hook is irresistible even if you cant tell your your DC from your Marvel. The premise of two unbeatable titans clashing has a deep almost primal pull Homer knew this when he made Hector and Achilles fight in The Iliad. And comic-book writers have known this since 1940 when the Human Torch took on the Sub-Mariner in Marvel Mystery Comics 8 (fire versus water; the fight of the century) Superheroes have been brawling with each other for decades -- sometimes because of a misunderstanding other times because of moral or philosophical differences. The upcoming Captain America Civil War which will force most of the characters from the Marvel Comics movie universe to pick a side between Iron Man or Captain America is based on a storyline from the books that explored the tricky balance between freedom and security and what sort of limits and regulations we are willing to accept in order to feel safe and protected. Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice which was written by Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer is about a billionaire vigilante who picks a fight with a superpowered alien for accidentally toppling one of his skyscrapers. The movie borrows most heavily from Frank Millers seminal 1986 The Dark Knight Returns mini-series which told of an aged bitter Batman who was forced out of retirement by a surge in crime and had to defend his brutal methods against a government-lackey Superman. But Snyder and his screenwriters have dumbed down Millers smarter more resonant narrative and turned it into an apology for the apocalyptic finale of Man of Steel in which Superman (Henry Cavill) and the evil General Zod (Michael Shannon) flattened half of Metropolis during their climactic showdown. Although the buildings that were demolished in the previous film were all curiously empty -- Snyder took care not to show any fallout or casualties from the fight -- the level of CGI-overkill was so great that it was insulting to insist Supermans victory didnt come with an enormous body count which would be a betrayal of the characters essence. So Snyder walks back that defense at the start of the new picture opening with billionaire Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) watching the Superman-Zod fight from ground level and seeing one of his buildings -- now suddenly full of people -- laid low. This radical revisionism which treats the audience like idiots is the first indication that Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice exists primarily to live up to the second half of its title -- to serve as a launching pad for a DC Comics film franchise to mirror the wildly profitable cinematic universe Marvel Studios has carefully developed since 2008s Iron Man. In other words Batman v Superman is a sleek stylish commercial by a studio desperate to birth a new cash cow post-Harry Potter. Almost every aspect of the film -- from the shoehorning of Diana Prince (a beautifully blank Gal Gadot) aka Amazonian warrior Wonder Woman into the plot to pointless cameos by several other fan-favorite DC characters -- feels like it was decided in a boardroom instead of a writers pen. Moving away from the golden airy feel of Man of Steel Snyder apes the dark brooding aura director Christopher Nolan brought to his Dark Knight trilogy. But he doesnt have the breadth or vision to match the style A lot of the movie feels like a retread right down to the 956th retelling of the night in which a young Bruce Wayne saw his parents gunned down in front of him. Is there anyone left on the planet who still doesnt know how Batman came to be? Affleck who gets top billing over Cavill in what is essentially a sequel to Man of Steel fares OK as Bruce Wayne but these characters are too played out too familiar for any actor to make much of an impression. Mostly Affleck looks good in a cowl (his Batman is more physical and sadistic than previous incarnations). Cavill suffers nobly - a savior empty-suit. Only Jesse Eisenberg as the maniacally evil Lex Luthor seems to be trying to do something different with his role He lets you see the wires short-circuiting inside the villains head when he schemes. But the movie has no use for him other than as a plot device a mechanism to set certain events in motion with no apparent motivation. This huge unwieldy movie is busy and overcrowded Theres a subplot involving terrorists Amy Adams Lois Lane is in constant need of rescuing and Holly Hunter plays a gullible U.S. Senator. Unlike Man of Steel which couldnt avoid the draggy pacing of origin stories Batman v Superman is loaded with incident and moves briskly. But the only things that register are fleeting inconsequential beats such as the most outrageous Batcave entrance to date or a dream sequence in which Batman imagines hes in a future realm in which Superman and his fellow evil aliens have conquered the world. That scene which is shot in one long take is weird and exciting and strange a brief glimpse at the bolder more original movie Snyder is capable of making. But after the financial failure of Watchmen his epic R-rated adaptation of the Alan Moore graphic novel that failed to rake in the expected cash Snyder learned his lesson. Hes no longer going to take any big risks. Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice does a good job of building up your anticipation for the title bout and the fight when it finally arrives is an all-out brawl (the movie doesnt cop out with a draw either; there is an undisputed winner). But if youve seen the trailer which has been inescapable you already know most of the films surprises including the third-act arrival of another infamous villain. That character should have been kept as secret as the movies ending which is one of the few things in Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice you havent seen before and leaves the story if not dangling then at least begging to be continued. Dont worry Filming on The Justice League Part One is scheduled to begin in April.

If theres any justice dawning or otherwise at the multiplex audiences will reject Zack Snyders lumbering dead-on-arrival superhero melange a 250 million tombstone for a genre in dire need of a break. Its supposed to be the glorious ramp-up to a new crime-fighting franchise DC Comics Justice League but youll wish this strenuously empty movie had boned up on a few lessons beforehand Theres zero humor or self-deprecation as there was in Joss Whedons pitch-perfect The Avengers; no performance of unlikely depth like the one Heath Ledger pulled off in The Dark Knight; and no animating spirit of decency a trait Christopher Reeves Superman had in spades. Instead we have Henry Cavills persistently inert Clark Kent and somehow worse Ben Afflecks one-dimensionally vexed Bruce Wayne (less playboy than paycheck) squaring off in a Metropolis still reeling from the devastation of 2013s Man of Steel. Neither actor is capable of setting the screen on fire--their first verbal showdown is hardly Pacino versus De Niro in Heat--but the imbalance feels especially acute in a city thats supposed to be publicly debating the philosophical merits of omnipotence. Add to the mix Jesse Eisenbergs instantly annoying tic-laden Lex Luthor a millennial billionaire who speaks in chattering screenwriter-ese (""The red capes are coming"") and Amy Adamss Lois Lane never more lost in a film that has no use for her softness and you have a distinctly plastic affair. The plot turns on the shocking never-mentioned-again destruction of a symbolic American edifice a bloodless explosion that one-ups Independence Days White House flattening for glibness. Minutes later were supposed to be whipped into a fanboy frenzy by the tribal drumming that accompanies our first hints of Gal Gadots severely corseted Wonder Woman (a character that could use some complexity and if its not too late a better actor). The endgame is your typical WrestleMania nonsense bereft of weight or grandeur set in a generic rubblescape thats emblematic of the scripts lack of human stakes. (Affleck brings on his Argo writer Chris Terrio but the impact is negligible.) Only the movies seesawing Sergei Prokofiev-inspired score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL contains a glimmer of wit. Shamelessly Batman v Superman lunges for a funereal mood in its final stretch but come on We all know superheroes dont die not when there are reboots in the balance. After this one youll wish a few of them did.

Contrary to what some critics have said this is not a popcorn movie and is not overstuffed. The story is clear characters act according to what they know and Justigue League elements are drawn briefly.Batman v Superman has a clear outline Act 1 Accountability after Man of Steel; Act 2 Batman v Superman; Act 3 Dawn of justice. But.. besides this fact there is not much in this movie that you might have seen in any Superman or Batman movie or even in other Superhero o Comic movies. For the way it was cut it seemed there was too much material they wanted to add and maybe there was a struggle with the running time. This could be the reason for the upcoming extended R rated version. The BvS fight in the second act was not as long as I had expected. It delivered on the premise but lacked dialogue between the two main characters and Id say that about 70% of the fight scenes are already on the trailers and advances.BvS introduces us to Afflecs Batman an older experienced vigilante acting with disregard with the law and even going as far as killing and using firearms. We see again Henry Cavill doing the heavy work as Superman (not a task for anybody) and Gal Gadot as the first big screen incarnation of Wonder Woman.BvS its a outstanding film. Read the reviews but watch the film and make up your own mind.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMar 25 20161 of 2 found helpfulJohn SFeatured""People hate what they dont understand."" The film was wonderful its not exhausting but rather dark and rewarding. It deserves a viewing before you form an opinion because the simple-minded will miss out of this gem.  Its shot gorgeously has a thrilling soundtrack great performances from the cast and fans of comic books will be in for a treat. This review does not reflect the opinion of a fan but rather someone who had the pleasure of being able to watch the film early and possibly had a preconceived view of it.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMore13 hours agojulio brunomoderatorFeaturedI was expecting more; actually no more stuff as this movie is full of it trying to be too many things in what it feels like a panic reaction to the Marvel universe movies success. But I was expecting more depth better acting better script. The plot tries to almost reset the Batman franchise but Bales Batman is still too recent and too good for this. Lex Luthors character reminds me too much of a certain internet mogul played by the same actor. Just adding more tics. Unbearable Eisenberg.I did not get the pointless introduction of Wonder Woman as a two-dimensional character. (By the way was Captain America in that black amp; white photo?). She did not add much to the movie Im afraid.There were far too many loose ends for my taste. The battle between Batman and Superman was over so fast and suddenly they are friends How? Why?At least the money spent in special effects can be seen. It is fast-paced except for the funeral bits and it is clearly setting up the new tirade of new DC heroes coming our way. Looking forward to Marvel vs DC in years to come... Or maybe not?

It combines so many things with very smart way It starts like a psychological mystery film and give it all at the end with epic battles.  If you see deep in the core of this movie you will discover a great combination of different comic aspects. This movie deserve a multilevel analysis and a fair criticismHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Website terms of use Contact us Get listed Advertising Time Out products Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Foursquare Time Out New York Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/us/film/batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice,200,batman50,batman,timeout
