By David Denby Noomi Rapace in Ridley Scotts first science-fiction film since ""Blade Runner.""   Credit Illustration by Martin Ansin I have fervently loved only one film from Ridley Scotts irrepressible output--""Thelma amp; Louise"" (1991) with its beautiful women on the lam its casual mayhem sex and giddy exhilaration. But Scott has made good movies in many genres. He has had a long career as a superlative craftsman of violent spectacle including the stomach-piercing and (for the audience) stomach-churning science-fiction horror story ""Alien"" (1979); the rain-soaked velvety darkly mysterious ""Blade Runner"" (1982); the whirling clangorous ""Gladiator"" (2000); the war film ""Black Hawk Down"" (2001) with its continuous lines of spatially connected action; and ""American Gangster"" (2007) a knowing portrait of Harlem crime bosses forging their way through the murderous ups and downs of the drug trade. Among commercially successful big-time directors perhaps only Steven Spielberg has produced a greater number of memorable images and sequences. Scotts new movie ""Prometheus"" in 3-D is his first sci-fi project since ""Blade Runner"" and it certainly has a look--its grand sombre and gray like some region of Hell that Dante never got around to mapping. Scott chooses his palette and sticks to it; hes not a director who throws color or digital uproar or meaningless airborne collisions across the screen. Hes not out to charm or tease. The action is weighted and scary the opposite of glib. He wants to impress us; he wants to scare the hell out of us. ""Prometheus"" begins aeons ago in a frigid magnificently drab region of the earth next to a waterfall where a circular spaceship silently looms and deposits a humanoid creature a phosphorescent bald naked fellow. He cracks apart and disintegrates and his DNA-laden chromosomes sink into the water. The screenplay by Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof has an epic scope from these fragments the human race will eventually be born. The movie then jumps ahead to 2089 when two archeologists Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and her boyfriend Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) discover some cave paintings with figures pointing to a planet or a moon. Its an invitation to visit Shaw reasons. A few years later the couple are part of the crew of a trillion-dollar spaceship Prometheus embarking on a two-year journey to the planet on which they believe the gods who created us live. Shaw uneasily wears a cross around her neck; she cant give up the God of the Bible even if he may not exist. The Prometheus expedition despite its grandiose ambitions is a corporate endeavor headed by Meredith Vickers who is played by a distant short-tempered Charlize Theron looking sleeker than ever in a silver-gray mohair suit--the epitome of outer-space chic. Vickers and the rest of the crew have been suspended in pods for the journey and tended by David (Michael Fassbender) an elegant blond android who amuses himself during the voyage by bicycling around the ship and shooting baskets. ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is his favorite movie; in his spare time he preens dyeing and brushing his hair until its golden and shiny like Peter OTooles. As the ship is about to land David wakes everybody up; hes polite even obsequious but hes subtly ironic too and increasingly malevolent. Hes a more than worthy successor to Kubricks HAL from ""2001"" who after all was just a large red eye staring out of a computer and speaking in a soothingly dominant voice. David brings out the wit in Fassbenders formidable self-possession in a way that none of his human characters have. Moviegoers may remember that ""Alien"" is also about a corporate project. The spaceship Nostromo is hauling a dreary cargo of ore back to Earth when it inadvertently allows an unpleasant intruder on board and ordinary life becomes a nightmare. ""Prometheus"" shares some preoccupations and visual motifs with the old shocker. There is a huge horseshoe-shaped spaceship; hissing viscous creatures; and an obsession with the violation of the human body--Scotts specialty in outlandish horror. Yet despite what you may have heard ""Prometheus"" is not literally a prequel. ""Alien"" turns into a haunted-spaceship movie; the large damp black creature pursues its victims through enclosed corridors eliminating one after another. ""Prometheus"" is just as scary but less claustrophobic. The spaceship lands in a barren gray area. Before it across a vast terrain lies an enormous circular closed-off structure. We thought that only man could make something as forbidding as a slag heap but apparently gods are capable of ugliness too. The crew members issue forth and the fear begins. They root around in mucky tunnels and caverns greeted only by white speckled apparitions that look like holographic versions of the phosphorescent guy we saw earlier. There is a snaky creature underfoot a body in a coffin and a vast arsenal of weapons but the creators have left the planet. Have they lost interest in us? The puzzle grows ominous. Are they going to destroy us? ""Prometheus"" I suppose could be dismissed as a metaphysical ""Boo"" movie. There are the usual attacks by creatures with tentacles that loop in and out of someones mouth and worse when Shaw is impregnated with the wrong kind of baby Scott puts her through a Cesarean so strange and abrupt that its a comic horror. Our response is saved from disgust by the extreme heroism of her suffering and endurance. Noomi Rapace is small and slender but as she demonstrated in the Swedish version of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" shes as fast as a whippet and precise in her fury. Scott may always have had an eye on the box office but from ""Alien"" and ""Thelma amp; Louise"" on he has made women into heroines. In that regard hes still ahead of the curve. Rapaces scene is a classic of its kind; it tops John Hurts notorious misfortunes in ""Alien."" There is too much trolling around in the dark and some garbled and repetitive plot turns in the film but when the action breaks out across that slate-colored plain Scott uses 3-D well giving the movement persuasive depth. He knows that the sight of a real human body charging through actual space is what produces excitement a simple enough lesson (all the old Hollywood directors knew it) that has recently collapsed into airborne digital scrambles in ""Avengers"" and a dozen movies like it. ""Prometheus"" may be a brutal spectacle and a scare show but Ridley Scotts craft is all-powerful. This movie earns an exhausted respect. ""Dark Horse"" the new film by Todd Solondz the New Jersey poet of bleakness and despair (""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" ""Happiness"") poses the question Is it possible to make an engaging movie about an infantile jerk? The odds are certainly against it. Abe (Jordan Gelber) is a portly college dropout who lives at the age of thirty-five with his parents (Christopher Walken and Mia Farrow) and works for his father unhappily in a commercial real-estate company. Abe is a liar and a fantasist a sorehead who throws tantrums. As always Solondz portrays suburban New Jersey as a kind of prison in which never an original or a lively word is spoken. Abe trapped and unable to find a way out desperately throws himself at an attractive but morose woman Miranda (Selma Blair) who also still lives at home. Blair is serious and muted--she looks like Susan Sontag without the restless energy. Much of the time Solondz works deep within banality which he finds both sad and funny. Hes a minor master of black comedy the flattened emotional response; the awkward leaden non sequitur; the perverse desire lurking beneath a bland surface. In some ways he seems almost trapped himself as if he cant shake his New Jersey childhood. In the past he has come close to punishing us with his sufferings but ""Dark Horse"" shows a greater expressive warmth and flexibility. If the underside of banality is black comedy the underside of dark comedy may be an almost limitless reserve of pity. Solondz can be cruel to his characters but this time he isnt. Though Abe is an unhappy loser Solondz stays with him. He leaves behind his initial strategy of stunted realism and by degrees and with great skill (the film is beautifully lit by the cinematographer Andrij Parekh) moves into Abes fantasies which become progressively more strange and humiliating. The answer then to the question asked by the movie is ""Yes if youre an artist."" As in some of David Lynchs work we cant always tell whether were in the real world or inside the characters head--Jordan Gelbers temperament and affect are the same in both. (Some of his snarling intonations and moods of lovelorn chagrin may remind you of Paul Giamatti in his early days.) Abe is blustery and self-pitying but with Solondzs new tender mercies fully engaged Gelber makes you feel close to a guy for whom nothing was ever meant to go right.

Ridley Scotts reputation as a master craftsman is well deserved and he offers up a big impressive eye-opening production. Its also well cast with two forceful female characters played for all theyre worth by Noomi Rapace (Swedens Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) and Charlize Theron. Even better the versatile Michael Fassbender plays a sly sophisticated robot built in human form to make the real humans more comfortable dealing with him. Hes a living breathing version of HAL 9000 from 2001 A Space Odyssey and like HAL he needs watching hes always one step ahead of everyone else on the spaceship Prometheus. The year is 2093. Rapace and her partner (Logan Marshall-Green) play scientists who thanks to a deep-pocketed corporation get the opportunity to travel on Prometheus to a distant moon in search of clues to the origins of mankind. A series of cave drawings have led them on this ambitious journey. Most of their fellow voyagers are just along for the ride including captain Idris Elba and chilly executive officer Theron. Its the quest for answers to the Big Questions that gives Prometheus its underpinning of thoughtfulness. (Rapace wears a cross given to her by her late father not to contradict her scientific discoveries but because she says ""Its what I choose to believe"" echoing the words of her dad.) When Ridley Scott directed his science-fiction saga Alien back in 1979 he dared to take his time carefully building up to the first scary incidents. That wont do in 2012 so there is a moment in the opening scene involving a humanoid creature that serves as a tease of things to come. This presages the bad news Prometheus may be more intelligent than run-of-the-mill sci-fi sagas but it doesnt skimp on icky gross-out moments or scenes in which characters make poor decisions that lead to their mutilation and demise--as in any tacky B movie. Watching Prometheus requires a strong stomach. The screenplay by Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof apparently began as a prequel to Alien and then evolved into something else but echoes of Alien remain which is why official acknowledgment is made to the writers of that film Dan OBannon and Ronald Shusett. While I was completely engrossed in Prometheus I felt a tug-of-war going on between the cerebral and visceral elements right up to the finale. In fact there are two endings and without giving anything away Ill say that I wish the movie had faded out after the first. Fans may disagree but I think the inconsistency in Prometheus DNA--and the obvious contradiction this represents--is what keeps it from being a great film or a ground-breaker as Alien was. I dont mean to damn this film with faint praise falling short of greatness doesnt mean the movie isnt gripping and entertaining. It is. And it certainly gives audiences their moneys worth. Prometheus is available for digital download now from Itunes and on DVD/Blu-ray everywhere October 9.

Reply jay are May 22 2016 1257 am Scott saps his own masterpiece Alien with this botch As if he was forced to make a fast buck. Reply Dean White May 22 2016 1257 am One of the worst films I have ever seen. Seriously terrible. Directorially incompetent. Just horrendous. Lost all respect for every critic who defends this abomination of cinema... Reply John May 22 2016 1257 am Just finished the movie. While I didnt really care for it the movie did provide a lot of suspense. My wife and I had a few theories going as to what was going on. I wasnt expecting something this gory (I normally avoid gory movies) so maybe it wasnt for me to begin with. I wouldnt watch it again yet Im left slightly intrigued as to some of the parallels they were trying to draw. Biggest complaint is the trillion dollar space mission by and large sent a bunch of nobodies with little training to do the job. Reply Wes4Les May 22 2016 1257 am This film fails to entertain on so many levels I wont spend an hour typing them all out. Whatever this film was ""supposed"" to be saying about human life originating elsewhere or something along those lines got lost in a shuffle of goopy special effects illogical situations wooden acting leaden pacing emotional distancing and thoroughly un-engaging performances. If this werent such a terrible let-down and disappointment to me Id hardly remember it. 17 crew members none of whom made an impact save for the android and even ""David"" behaved in a detestable fashion at times. As much as I appreciate Fassbender as an actor I nearly applauded when his character was attacked. Rapace is one of the least interesting actresses Ive ever seen; she has no spark of emotion in her acting what-so-ever. And Theron apparently caught her bug she was a vague non-entity in this much like the rest of the wasted non-descript cast. I cannot believe people defend this movie on any point or grounds; if Id paid to see this in the theater I wouldve been sorely tempted to leave at some point. To hades with special effects; I dont pay good money to be ""dazzled"" by something a computer created I wanted an interesting film and got ""Slither"" in space with an enormous budget. Reply katesisco May 22 2016 1257 am Thought about it for a while; and beyond entertainment is the concept of how artificial life will animate itself; make its own decisions create its self in a human image. David does all this; he eats and drinks when the crew is asleep he exercises he models himself after Peter OToole in the movie he is not able to be unlugged as Ws daughter says she will do. David is the life created by the god W as shown by the foot-washing episode. This movie clearly was elevating itself past the Aliens format to compete with 2001 A Space Odyssey. Hal runs amok and David is more cleaver he makes plans. Reply Chemtrait May 22 2016 1257 am Absolutely incredible.

There is one thing for a deliberately paced film and another for one that sleep walks. I loved Alien and is the only movie I have seen with two hands over my eyes. In this turkey Scott seems to have no clue on what type of film he wants to make. And the make-up on Guy Pearce was terrible reminding me of Bette Midlers make-up in For The Boys. Why not just get an actor in that age group? I thought the actingsave for Fassbender was robotic. I never bought any of them as scientists. This was a huge disappointment. Reply Patrick M. Gouin May 22 2016 1257 am When director Ridley Scott (Alien and Blade runner) does a science fiction film it is an event. The film takes us 70 years in the future aboard the space vessel Prometheus en route to an unknown planet which is believed to harbour a mystery highly sought after. The parallels with Alien are numerous. In many ways this story is the un-admitted prequel to Alien with the added bonus of some explanations. Alien was high on horror and anticipation but lacking in information and motivation. In both films space exploration is in the hands of private enterprise which subjugates scientific rigour to megalomania. When Alien came to the screens I remember finding this omnipresence of Capitalism in space exploration farfetched. Today I must admit that we are headed in that direction and speedily at that. Just think of the space tourists. We again find a lactated android who keeps vital information from the crew and follows his own agenda. It is highly unlikely that a dozen people sent far into space would not have access to vital information. Smoking is still a habit in this near future although in sharp decline today except maybe in Asia which will surely come around in the next 70 years. Again we find a strong heroine. In Alien she was called Ripley her she is Shaw played by Noomi Rapace. We remember her as the ground breaking heroine Lisbeth Salander in the Millennium series (the Swedish version). Probably one of Scottas inside jokes Rapaceas character is named Elizabeth Shaw. The resemblance between the two names is too great for a coincidence. More than 30 years after Alien a reprise of similar movie effects and storyline does not move todayas audiences as before. There are many characters in this film that lack development. We are all together surprised when these illustrious unknowns do the ultimate sacrifice. There will be a sequel no doubt the ending leads us on. Reply Mike May 22 2016 1257 am I saw the movie...pretty good overall. I liked the way it sorta made a connection between these events and what John Hirt found on the derelict ship in the original Alien movie. It went along pretty weel until near the end. The last surviving Engineer sits in the space-jockey chair...puts on the helmet....voila...elephantine space jockey that was found dead and calcified in the original. I thought...""OK that was the guy they found""...and I guess somewhere later he will get a facehugger on him and will burst out of his chest the way they found him fossilized in the original. But then Prometheus throws a curveball. He escapes goes to Shaws lifeboat and attacks her. Then gets killed on the lifeboat. So where is the continuity....how can he be the fossilized space jockey with the hiole in his chest in the original. Dont tell me all these events happen again later. That was the biggest non-continuity factor for me. Any thoughts? Reply Ophelia May 22 2016 1257 am Just saw it. Enjoyed it on the whole. Then enjoyed reading these comments. I thought I must be being dim because I couldnt follow the plot or that it was too deep/cosmic/intelligent for me but think that could actually just be a sign of bad storytelling as Im not really that dim. I loved some of the goriness as a non sci-fi fan (usually) however. Enjoyed the Vagina Dentata (Dali fear of vagina with teeth?) and consuming sex-monsters. It had potential comedy in the worst period pains in the world scene when she staggers along the corridor and the sexy boyfriend is actually a monster especially when he gets you up the duff scene and the weird wipe your slimy bogeys on the wall bit. Hmm. I thought Shaw was very convincing and somehow earthy despite it all and it was a strong female role. The script seemed a bit non-existent. No good lines particularly. The feminine soulless metrosexual Fassbender was really marvellous. Reply GOO6ER May 22 2016 1257 am Producers were determined not to connect this project with any of the Alien canon that occurred in the post-Sigourney Weaver films. Yet resemblances to ""Alien vs. Predator"" are striking starting with the unprofessional and downright moronic actions of secondary characters. Its disappointing that a nevertheless good flick like this has to resort to disposable movie cliches. And I would really like to get to know the 3 pilots better before Ill buy that theyll decide in an instant to sacrifice themselves on a plea by Shaw. They didnt even propose an alternative. I loved the comparison of them to Christ on the cross the pilot in the middle and the two co-pilots on each side. Recall they even raised their arms outstretched to their sides at the moment of impact. Excellent metaphor considering they are the ""saviors"" of Earth. Reply Sham May 22 2016 1257 am I am a sci-fi geek and I did not like this movie. I enjoyed the visuals the ideas and the possibilities. I did not like the grind house grotesquery.. It was epic one moment then ""B"" rate Forbidden Planet the next. The movie was not suspenseful like the Alien movie. The movie was not intense with non stop action like James Camerons Aliens. This is not a prequel to Alien. The movie takes place somewhere on a moon in the galaxy of Alien. I had a very familiar feeling of Ive seen this in that movie-oh and OH Ive seen this in that movie. The android is sabotaging the crew- Alien- next an alien birth - V the TV series- next dont touch that alien snake- Leviathan-next hes turning into an alien zombie because of alien goo- Green Lantern LOL next lets crash the ship into their ship to stop them-Star Trek movies twice. I felt the movie was a combination of everything sci-fi Ive seen in my life. It would have been cool if Ridley Scott would have had the gonads to keep with a creationist story-thats new in Hollywood. Oh the critics might have found that more grotesue than an Alien octopus c-section. Just Sayin. Reply Desmond May 22 2016 1257 am A lot of the criticism of this movie seems to be of this flavor people who simply didnt understand the movie. Re David The moon is not the Engineers home planet it was a military/bio-weapons base and therefore they did not ""develop"" there. Why does David do anything he does? If you have to ask that you clearly werent paying attention. The only questionable/unexplained thing he does is intentionally infecting Holloway with the black substance though he does this right after Weyland orders him to ""try harder"". He didnt necessarily know that it would have the effects that it did for all he knew it was the elixir of immortality that Weyland was looking for. Reply Sanya May 22 2016 1257 am This movie was so incredibly atrocious that itas hard to put into words just how bad it is I was feeling extremely disappointed and just plain angry that I wasted hours of my life watching such drivel. The only relief were the comfy seats at Wave Cinema. It makes me sick to see the great talents of the visual effects artists wasted a not to mention the gargantuan sums of money that it must have cost. I have lost all respect for Ridley Scott and I hope this pile of offal fades quickly into the obscurity of failure and doesnat besmirch the incredible legacy of Alien and Aliens. Reply David May 22 2016 1257 am Does anyone notice that the beings on the moon from whom we derive our DNA also live in an incompatible atmosphere? How can they be genetically identical to us yet have developed on a planet so inhospitable to human life? Or that the resuscitated head croaks yet could not have had lungs or vocal chords? This movie was typically American; visually overstimulating and ignorant in the details. Any keen eye will spot a logical inconsistency per minute. The characters act with incoherent agendas especially the robot David? Why does he do ANYTHING he does? A thinking person cannot enjoy this flick. It insults the intellect believing that when your mouth drops in awe at what you see your brain stops working. Reply JC May 22 2016 1257 am Truly a mixed bag. The basic underlying concept is worthwhile and the movie is just beautiful to look at. The effects are wonderful and there are just enough ""ick"" moments to remind us that we are in a horror/sci-fi agglomeration. Its great to see the ""Alien"" motif on screen again and to see some development of the aim of the ""Space Jockeys"" and the origin of the xenomorphs. The lack of character development or definition the outlandishly ridiculous choices and actions of the characters and the scientific oversights and blunders mar what could have been a splendid movie experience. So many of these items have already been enumerated that I wont bother going into detail (taking off helemts in an unknown environment; running jumping leaping and grabbing after abdominal surgery etc.). Sure we can be apologists for many of these occurrences but it would have been preferable to plausibly get to where you needed to be by another route or at least attempt to explain some of them with snippets of expository dialogue. The actions of the characters in ""Prometheus"" remind me of the characters in ""Enterprise"" the last TV incarnation of ""Star Trek."" In an attempt to portray mankind as naive and new to the wonders of outer space the ""Enterprise"" writers stripped away all layers of common sense and made them profoundly stupid. This was simply evidence of writers that just did not have the chops to get to the point that they wanted to get to in a realistic fashion. Nevertheless I hold out some hope that an extended cut made availabe on BD / DVD will patch up some of the holes and heal the wounds as miraculously as Shaws staples healed her. Although flawed I still applaud ""Prometheus"" for the effort. It was nice to see an attempt at film-making that went beyond pandering to the lowest common denominator present in far too many movies today - sound and fury signifying nothing. They should have tried a bit harder however. I believe that the fear (fact?) that todays audiences have very short attention spans contributed to the decision to possibly cut material that could have made some of the cringe-worthy moments more palatable. Overall Id grade it a B- and would look forward to an additional installment or two. Reply CJ May 22 2016 1257 am my bf worked on this movie and he said everyone working on it was a fool had no previous knowledge of other cinematic achievements and the actors were very much as you see them on film - like without any real consideration. Noomi was a constant diva on the set and Charlize was always trying to act ""cool"" with the crew who were not impressed with her contrived attitude. He was very excited to work on it ( worked on other Scott films) however is very much ashamed of it... he said everyone on the set thought the script writing was lacking in depth and that taking off the helmets wasnt very smart however it was Foxs idea who insisted it to the actors were to be seen oh well another one bites the dust Reply novamike May 22 2016 1257 am There are basically two reasons to see this movie Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender a couple of kick-ass actors who make this otherwise uninspired sort-of prequel to Alien watchable. Rapace is to this movie everything Sigourney Weaver was to Alien-a strong beautiful female lead who immediately gets you rooting for her. Fassbender-wow its hard to say enough about his performance as David the android who patterns himself after the young Peter OToole through watching his movies. His motives are fascinatingly opaque even at the storys resolution and he manages to be both charming and sympathetic as well as chillingly scary ... more chilling really than any of the monsters who though icky are kind of old hat. And that is one of the big problems with this film it really delivers nothing very new aside from its admittedly great special effects. The other characters are mostly stock throw-ins and some are just too damned stupid to live which in fact they dont do for very long. Most disappointing though are the so-called engineers or space-jockeys who apparently created the human race and then had sufficient second thoughts about it to want to wipe us out. Basically they are simply over-sized humanoids. Their motivation for creating and then trying to destroy the human race is non-existent and even though Rapace sets out to solve this mystery at the end of the film its hard to imagine that the answer will be very interesting if theres ever a sequel to the prequel. I could also nit-pick on some of the mis-matches in story and detail with Alien but wont bother. If you were a big fan of Alien and Aliens they are easy enough to spot. And oh ... its not nearly as scary as Alien but that is probably because theres little shock value in gory stuff exploding out of peoples bodies when you already know its going to happen. All of this said Id still recommend the movie if only for Rapace and Fassbenders great performances and for the terrific sets and special effects. See it in 3-D for sure and IMax if possible. Reply mike schlesinger May 22 2016 1257 am Strip away the stunning visuals and the metaphysical psycho-babble and what youre left with is the black-tie version of THE GREEN SLIME. Once you accept that youre fine. Reply john12 May 22 2016 1257 am testing Reply Tony Fiorentino May 22 2016 1257 am This movie must end on the garbage heap of sci-fi. The will do anything to get you to a theatre then they throw shit at you. How many Alien monster body invasions do we have to see. This is Ridley Scott tribute to crap. A captain who acts more like a garbage truck driver - out having sex the first night on a strange planet while an alien life lurks in a cavern. The man hardly speaks English. I bet there was more intelligence on the boat that first dumped its gargo at Colony Bay than there is in this movie. The crew is totally unvetted and out of sync with what is going on. Perhaps it is us who expected too much from movie-making for profit. Reply Mike Page May 22 2016 1257 am Wow this movie really hit some nerves for you all good and bad. I liked the visuals mostly and cant help but feel the movie was really Ridley Scotts tribute to science fiction films of the 20th century and their origins in pulp magazine and paperback art. Noomi Rapace looks like the woman in Metropolis. The bubble space suits look like EC comics and the original Buck Rogers pulp cover. The space ship interior looks like 2001. And of course all the Alien images etc. There were enough ideas and concepts in the film to restart the Alien franchise and also the visuals let us sci-fi movie fans of old enjoy some grat nostalgia for what has come before. And I cant help but feel that Jack Kirby and Forrest Ackerman would have really enjoyed it. Reply Julie Lhbjh May 22 2016 1257 am OK we two hard core lovers of SciFi books and movies notably Alien just couldnt get through this movie. We DID love the red mapping balls and the surgery segment. We went for a drink afterward and had conversation of all the cliches in this movie some from the 50s. (We DO love the artwork of H.R. Geiger. Yes we Can suspend disbelief. And yes I am carping. Just us old timers would notice anything.  from the cave to a specialized starship with nary a wrinkle on her face the ubiquitous solo android - Hi Dave smoking ciggys on ship incredibly inept people on the ship (a la Destination Moon) why rocketry if they have antigravity (red mapping globes) why venture forth immediately upon landing 6 hr. til dusk whipping off those masks underground in variable atmosphere everybody touching EVERYTHING  a storm worthy of Forbidden Planet the old guys not old (actor was young) vaporization in bubble helmets down the throat stuff again underground ship like X Files Tron uniforms  we did like the ending in yet another Pod escape Reply Tom Vierce May 22 2016 1257 am I do understand what this movie is all about what its trying to say when left the theater (as having background as a 100% Nerd and 100% science fiction hardcore). I am trying to be objective because i am one of alien fans. Many great movies that have much more complex story line and ideas than Prometheus can deliver it in good smart analytical and established ways. But Prometheus has shown me otherwise. The concept of faith and ancient astronauts mix is not something new to me and it left me out of wow factor when watching the first scene of the movie. And after watching it for some more i found that Prometheus has many weaknesses mainly in the script where all the characters always behaving irrational and shows intelligence third of normal human being (as its has been shown by many forums out there). Maybe if there is one scene that explained if space travel and cryostasis can reduced your normal brain capacity and capability into 30% i can forgive all the scenes that happened after that. There are many moments in the film when i actually do get bored. And it makes me left the theater with empty feeling. I do agree with LM that this is not a great film it even not trying to be one. Offer us againsomething fresh something new something that makes you crave for more in one solid and full package. A brilliant plot rational character thinking and emotional story telling Sir Ridley.. And it would revive the Alien franchise once again that can withstood the time. Reply Javi May 22 2016 1257 am I just watched it. I liked it. I have some questions but it might be because I was eating my nachos. What I notice about the comments posted is the people who liked the movie have explained their reasons why. And the people who didnt like it use weak words and cannot explain why. Reply Elaine May 22 2016 1257 am The movie is beautifully shot glossy and with enough special effects to leave you ""starry eyed."" But ultimately I think the source of my disappointment in the movie is that it is largely an exercise in Darwinism; far too many characters make completely unintelligible mistakes their own lack of survival skills rendering them un-relatable and flat. Yet Shaw is the razor-sharp contrast her own survival skills so remarkable that she becomes nearly super-human in her own right. Its this very distinct contrast that makes it hard for me to feel connected to any of the human characters; I left the theater feeling as though so many of them were ciphers meant to propel the philosophical and theological questions more than provide meaningful contributions to the overall story. In comparison to the original ""Alien"" Id say Ripley and crew felt far more ""human"" to me than those of ""Prometheus."" What sticks with me more than anything is the imagery of the captain and his co-pilots sacrificing themselves. It wasnt until the credits were rolling that I realized how subtly it referenced the crucifixion; the captain sacrificing himself for the sake of mankind while his co-pilots completed the picture as they flanked his sides. Coyly it hearkens back to the Christmas tree at the start of the movie but in this heavy netting of philosophical ponderances Im still left wondering what it means how it fits with Shaws own belief system and how it will shape the story of a possible sequel if Ridley sees fit to further the Judeo-Christian theme. Reply Claire May 22 2016 1257 am I just watched it in a theater. In fact I didnt know what this movie wanted to say. This was too hard to understand so I am reading some reviews and comments for better understanding. Reply Carthy May 22 2016 1257 am A good level of excitement wonderful performances and an interesting plot-those are the pluses. And I agree overall its well worth seeing. There was a lot of jumpy disjointed storytelling though (felt like a little too much unthoughtful editing) and some confusing scenes. The ""second ending"" felt like a complete nonsequitur. My favorite part (and one of the most interesting sci-fi ideas Ive ever seen) was the surgery machine. Reply mm May 22 2016 1257 am Just saw Prometheus....I want my money back Probably the worst movie I ever saw I REALLY went bad when the c-section was done and then she was move active the a athletes in the Olympics Reply DJ Pondo May 22 2016 1257 am I really enjoyed Prometheus. And in a selfish way Im happy that so many people have made unfavorable comments about the movie. Those comments may cause the movie to spend less time in theaters - and help get it released on Blue-Ray sooner. So keep dissin the flick yall. I already pre-ordered my copy on Amazon. Reply nevil May 22 2016 1257 am I am interested in seeing the next part of the movie. This part looked more like a prequel to aliens. I feel the story lacks a firm premise on which I can justify my conclusions. Lot of things are just said leaving us to ponder on what may be the real cause of the cave man drawings found at the beginning of the movie. Further the movie becomes interesting once there is a dna match of humans but then it brings you back to thinking about the end where an alien is born off the first human. More than anything I miss the predators hope that they include the predators in the next part of the movie. Reply Buzzardbill May 22 2016 1257 am As drs. Shall 1st do no harm a movie requires suspension of disbelief. When you do this becomes a highly entertaining film. I thoroughly enjoyed this flick by not nitpicking details which I sometimes do. Once I gave up trying to decide if that was Tom Hardy in the male lead I sat back absorbed the fine acting 1st rate effects and mythological storytelling. A 9 out of. 10. Reply Howard May 22 2016 1257 am I saw it in 2-d because the 3-d version had already started. Some of the actions of the crew seemed silly since they are scientists and certainly aware of the dangers posed by such things as alian viruses etc. One such seen however would have been far more scary in 3-d and hence more entertaining. The film was certainly gripping and I will definitely see the sequel. Reply Marc May 22 2016 1257 am Movie should be called ""PROTHETICUS"" seems the whole movie script was dropped and just thrown together to make a mess of a compilation of sorts? All acting sucked visual graphics were cool but the movie sucked guess they forgot about a climax or any other writing rules. That dam robot couldnt keep his hands off everything and no one told him to stop I would have shot him with my fazer he was annoying as the rest of them all were also no main character stupid scientist this movie was a wast of my time and money. Reply Hannah Banana May 22 2016 1257 am Remember ""GUY"" in ""Galaxy Quest""?....thats what some of these people were ""GUY"" the first one(s) to die. So that isnt saying a lot when comparing 2 movies huh? Finally got my husband to go and he says ""its not like Alien is it"" (he doesnt like the whole squishy alien thing). Oh no no no thats not what I heard. oops. I guess squid aliens = squishy aliens. And trying to explain how a woman who just had a C-section running around with alarms blaring (any other time someone was getting busted on doing ANYTHING) and actually doing the physicality of it all...noooooo way. I wanted to like this movie as much as Alien but didnt. It was okay and the expectations couldve been met but werent. I thought it would be more thought-provoking like ""Inception"" where you actually had to discuss it and watch a second time because you wanted to really dissect it. Now THAT is a winner....a movie that makes you think but entertains. Reply Andy May 22 2016 1257 am I suppose you could argue that the idiot B-movie behaviour (They were all so stupid they deserved to die) is a metaphor for the way that humans are destroying the earth and would justify the Engineers decision to terminate the lot of us. Reply Jonathan May 22 2016 1257 am I find it amusing that folks watch this film and dont grasp it. Therefore they say the movie is stupid crap a waste etc. Its a mistake to project your own inability to understand the story on the film. The suppossed plot holes are none existent as many posts and other sites have explained. In most cases it is a matter of the viewer missing key details or not paying attention. This film is amazing smart beautiful and the first step towards a greater story. I loved the thoughtful insights involving Darwinism Creationism Mythology Theology Sociology Politics Military Agenda Spirituality Biology etc. - WONDERFUL I really appreciated that the filmakers opened a dialogue for the audience to ponder. They dont tell or presume that they have an answer for these BIG questions. Now we have the chance to discuss these things amongst ourselves. In this way PROMETHEUS is as groundbreaking as Alien and Blade Runner (Both films which still have their fair share of admirerers and detractors by the way). I appreciate everyones opinion on this film. I think that Sir Ridley Scott has given us a gift in this film tha transcends the film. In another ten years it will have its place amongst the great SCI-FI epics. It deserves it now in my opinion. I really think one needs to be careful in declaring a film Stupid or Crap solely because it wasnt understood didnt meet a misplaced expectation or follow a certain genre formula. I love the allusions to genetic advancement/perversion as a metaphor to a spiritual condition. WOW A ton of deep stuff in this film and I will need to watch it a few times. That alone makes this film brilliant. Reply Marge May 22 2016 1257 am What do you mean by Prometheus ""DNA"" and the obvious contradiction this represents? Reply Scott May 22 2016 1257 am I wanted Prometheus to deliver on what the trailers promised us. It did in one regard it is a visually stunning film. However the poorly constructed story lack of focus logic and continuity act in concert with poor acting to give us Ridley Scotts ""MESSterpiece"". Like a sculptor attempting to make a beautiful cake but with no knowledge of the ingredients the cake looks fantastic but ultimately tastes like sh. Im glad I went however the popcorn was excellent. Reply Dylan May 22 2016 1257 am I freakin loved this movie damn good job Reply Mike May 22 2016 1257 am Prometheus is one of those films that needs to be digested over time. Like Stanley Kubrik there is a method to his madness. This will hold up just as ""Blade Runner"" and ""Alien"". Maltin mentions ""Alien"" as a groundbreaking movie. Funny his review only merited 2.5 stars back in 1979. Is he back peddling? Sadly no mention of Jerry Goldsmiths absence makes me very sad though I was pleased that about 30 seconds of his music from the original ""Alien"" was used in Prometheus. Finally stop whining about the guts and gore. This is a horror/science fiction film. We all knew that going in. If you dont care for blood and guts go rent ""Driving Miss Daisy"". Reply Andy May 22 2016 1257 am Very poor indeed I was hugely disappointed. I expected so much better from Ridley Scott. Whilst the visuals and special effects were outstanding the plot was rushed and made too many jumps. The worst feature though was the plain stupid B-movie behaviour. ""plenty of oxygen and Low CO2 Ill take my helmet off then"" ""No dont"" ""See its fine"" "" Oh OK then"" . Ever heard of viral infevtion ? ""What has happened to Fifield and the other one?"" - Dunno maybe you should check the video record of them being attacked maybe.... ""Fifields beacon just appeared outside"" So why not talk to him ? If he doesnt answer why not take a look on the camera ? On the other hand just open the damn door so he can kill 3 of us. Had a Caesarian Section ? Had your abdoninal muscles severed ? Then jumping out of bed and running down the corridor should be no problem (alternatively it might be impossible). And seriously does she get to run around the whole ship without anyone noticing ? Reply johny May 22 2016 1257 am Unbelievable funny Amazing Fruits In The World Must See Only For Laugh . http//www.funnyblips.com/2012/06/unbelievable-funny-amazing-fruits-in.html Reply Rick May 22 2016 1257 am I was greatly looking forward to seeing this movie after all of the advertising buildup on YouTube. I enjoyed Michael Fassbenders role as David especially after seeing him as Magneto in the latest X-Men movie. Still I agree there was something missing. The planet and ship were polished and clean and missing the edginess from the first Alien film. The special effects were beautiful with the holographic projections but the grotesque out scenes and the super bulked up aliens did nothing for me. A lady in the audience pretty much summed up the disappointment I felt in the movie. She turned to her husband and said that was stupid. I found myself having to agree. The two characters that get killed were so over the top they may as well have given them red shirts to wear like the away team security detail from Star Trek that usually get killed off on every episode of the original show. The confusion for me was the combination of polish then slime of the aliens. I like the actors in the movie but felt overall the film fell flat for me and was disappointing at the end. Reply Cathy May 22 2016 1257 am The diaglogue in this movie was sophmoric from the start. Scientists and doctors do not say ""shit"" and god damnit"" every time something goes wrong. And when they did have something to say it sounded like something a high school kid might say. I couldnt find anything remotely cerebral about this movie. And for a group of scientists they had no trouble touching anything that moved or oozed. How about the engineers talking to the disgusting dripping wet bone of saliva as if it were a puppy? Are you serious? And what about Charlize Theron. Same stance as in the perfume ad when she strips off her god lame. I dont know who this movie was pandering to but it wasnt somebody with half a brain. Two thumbs down. Reply chuck b May 22 2016 1257 am You are being very kind LM. This movie falls flat in many areas. The most glaring were the actors and screenwriters choices. We have scientists that are not scientific at all. One is getting drunk like he is in a vegas hotel room one is a geologist that comes off as a military specialist in the beginning and then the biggest wimp where as the biologist is not interested in biology. Lets not forget Charlize melodramatic interaction with overdone makeup job father. Just cast an old person. Is that so unbelievable these days...I am not comparing this movie with any others...it has some cool moments but most of it is flat. The one area that is missing the most is the audience liking anyone on this crew. I guess we like captain but the rest of them could have been robots for all we cared. I like reading your blog and I expected a much more critical review from you LM. Reply Charles May 22 2016 1257 am The one thing I missed is the terrifying look of the future itself that you got in ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"". The settings and technology in those movies had a more dark and worn out look that frighteningly realistic. The spaceship in this movie looked almost a little too neat and ""comfy"". Its funny that while this movie takes place before ""Alien"" the technology almost looks more advanced. Perhaps thats because this was a scientific mission and the spaceship in the original was a mining ship. But still I never felt completely pulled in to this world. It was pretty to look at but it did not have the moody suffocating atmosphere of ""Alien"" or ""Blade Runner"". Reply Capt. Mitch Witt May 22 2016 1257 am As a devout follower of all things Alien I can appreciate many comments on the Prometheus website as well as Mr. Maltins review. I liked the film I can accept the various little inconsistencies between Prometheus and Alien (LV322 vs 426 the final creatures form and mouth vs that trade mark double mouth in Alien etc) BUT I have not read anywhere that anyone realized that the surreal background music that I heard throughout the film was none other than the them music (slightly altered) from STAR TREK  Reply Michael May 22 2016 1257 am A transporting 3D entertainment if you turn off your brain for the second half. A bit sad premiering the day after Ray Bradburys leaving this reality into nothingness the father of thought-provoking well crafted fiction and science. Given the priorities of Hollywood will a writer/director ever be able present such science fiction on a big screen? There certainly is enough out there in print. Reply Mark Laurent May 22 2016 1257 am It was boring? I just expected more from Ridley Scott(which was the reason why I wanted to see it so bad). It does no justice to the first ""Alien"" movie which he directed also Remember that old Eddie Murphy joke(from the comedy classic ""Delirious"") about white folks always want to investigate sh%t when they shouldnt? But when Black folks hear ""Get Out"". Oh Sorry we cant stay Well you know they stayed and kept going back to check things out? Duh? All throughout the movie. I hate dumb ass people in films Mark Laurent(your former Intern  E.T. 1986) Reply capt May 22 2016 1257 am Id rather more of these "" Well made and directed/acted but didnt live up to expections"" type movies than abortions like Battleship/Transformers... Reply Rob May 22 2016 1257 am Naw you can say it. Its a farce. An abortion. An insult to Alien fans everywhere. It sucks. This movie should have been terminated in the womb via robotic C- Section. Reply Norm May 22 2016 1257 am I do have an idea for Sci-Fi kind of a S.King ripoff ""Spellcheck"" will not work on any computer in the world can mankind survive the chaos ? Then  machines start to think but cant communicate...Already been done...darn... Reply BC May 22 2016 1257 am In recent editions of the movie guide Leonard has changed his original Alien review from 2.5 stars (fair) to 3.5 (excellent). Would love to know more about his reassessment. Reply Rick Curzon May 22 2016 1257 am I take your points Leonard but I found the whole thing disappointing. None of the charachters made much of an impression and the script was perfunctory at best. It felt like much had been edited out to appease the short attention spans of today; can you imagine anyone making a blockbuster as deliberately paced as Alien (1979) or as intelligent? When I first caught A In back in 79 the tension was palpable and the suspense built up slowly. The Space Jockey was a truly weird creation whose seemingly classified presence left things open to interpretation. When we see what they look like their pasty WWF wrestling appearance just robs the original of any mystery. Picking up on scenes that seem to be missing; how did Idris Albas captain come to speculate that the alien building was a military installation? He hadnt been to see it for himself and at that point in the film the heroe / heroine hadnt had those thoughts yet? It seems to have been cut to increase the pace which is a shame. I also found the whole thing terribly derivative of many other much better films like Quatermass and the Pit (the fact the human race were created by aliens) The X Files (the black oil that infects folks is a direct crib visually and in concept) and Doctor Who which has dealt with many pompous alien races down the years but specifically the 1971 serial The Daemons which posits that an alien race who appear devil-like created the Earth as an experiment and have arrived to destroy what they deem a failure. Sounds awfully familiar.... Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

James Thurgood Marshgassaid on Saturday July 06 2013 23752 AMSeems those without science degrees (or any degrees) or having never had a scientific thought might be the only ones who have the intellectual sharpness to find this a wonderful film. When one is free of facts laws of nature absolute truths rational thinking etc. one is then free to ignore such non-sequiturs in a movie and able to instead choose to fill in the blanks with a sort of blank-slate imagination. Much like news anchors giving the mis-pronounced names of chemicals in a factory accident not knowing what the hell might actually happen but doing so with the ""correct"" emotion on their face and in their voice to connote to viewers that they really do know and the audience should feel similar emotions about the story and those involved. James Smithsaid on Tuesday January 22 2013 10845 PMI guess a lot of people rate films differently when they happen to be Sci-fi or some genres differently than they would otherwise because in the real world scientists dont act like this and weve had some quirky scientists throughout history and they wouldve even act like this. Also Im a bit tired of the idea that just because a person is driven or ambitious that that naturally makes them evil and deserving of a hideous unwarranted death. Prometheus looks fantastic and Id say see it but it really makes you wonder what will it be like when someone puts this much detail into a really well thought out film. nicolesaid on Tuesday November 20 2012 95523 PMI just watched prometheus LOVED IT ...AGAIN I WILL SAY ..I LOVE THIS MOVIE CAN NOT WAIT TO SEE IT AGAIN..this sequel answers some questions for me..like how did the original alien looked??.. and now i see how it was created by the human and the birth creature. Amazing... Steven Freekinsaid on Monday November 05 2012 110456 PMWow. I just watched the film again on bluray and i still love this film just as much as i did when i viewed it in IMAX 3D in theaters. I still cant believe why a lot of people disliked this film or let alone hated it. Ridley Scott delivered a great syfy spectacle incorporating greek mythology the alien universe mankind itself and religion. Yes there are a lot of unanswered questions and thats what i loved about the film. I as an audience filled those gabs in myself. Prometheus is one of the best films of the year and i cant wait for the sequel. Im tired of movies where they spell everything out to the audience like they dont have brains. Stevesaid on Thursday November 01 2012 62855 PMI may be one of the very few  who loved the movie  As a sci fi film  the screen writers dared to be different - and rather then a "" safe "" alien prequel - where given a whole new story in the same universe . I for one  was so happy to finally see just who the space jockeys are ... if you are an Alien fan  you will know that this was the creature sitting in the large chair found in the original Alien movie . I enjoyed the fim - and I think its an excellent sci fi film in its own right - just my opinion . TexasRicksaid on Sunday October 14 2012 22336 AMI could not have cared less what happened to the main characters in this movie because I didnt even know them. Thats where this movie failed. A lot of disjointed and meaningless activity IMO. Sometimes details are a good thing. dhdydzsaid on Saturday October 13 2012 95357 PMSo what Im getting from this dialogue is that geeks are incapable of (or unwilling to engage in) suspension of disbelief. Its kind of like some guy standing in front of the Sphinx after its just been finished and saying ""People dont have paws."" I had some of the same thoughts about some of the plot points and sequences as others apparently did but to let it ruin the movie ... artless. One person said nobody would ""touch"" the alien snake creature. Really you havent noticed that idiots tromping around the wild poking dangerous animals in the face with sticks is practically a tv genre? Im not normally one of those people who say this but here goes - its a movie And a damn well crafted one at that. You want all the sciencey-sounding-plausibility-enhancement details filled in for you read a book or as someone pointed out watch Star Trek. Heisenberg compensator ... b__ch please Better yet go back to college and get a physics degree or something so you can relax (your snarky pseudo intellectualism that is) and enjoy a beautiful piece of cinematic art. randomsaid on Friday October 12 2012 94724 PMStarts off very promising. Then the plot just gets stupid. Maybe Roeper and Ridley Scott are buddies - cause no way this gets an A+ - Its more like a C+. Ill take Roepers reviews with a grain of salt from now on. Sunshine by Ridley Scott was better than this. pat iannittisaid on Wednesday September 26 2012 104933 PMTo Mr. Gary Hamil You are right the people have spoken They spoke in 1968 2001 A Space Odyssey Made NO money Was re-released in 1973 Made some Money and today is hailed as an American Classic and one of the greatest pieces of art in human history.

Simply put Grandeur can be enough in itself. The bedrock of Scotts reputation consists of two pop masterpieces Alien (1979) and Blade Runner (1982) essentially a haunted-house shocker and an L.A. noir but made with such stylish solemnity theyve become more influential than Jaws or Star Wars. And just as serious Beatles fans appreciate the discipline of Revolver over the bands subsequent watershed Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band Scotts mote-fogged monster movie Alien has had more resonance than Blade Runner--prophetic as a piece of retro-futurism but not a landmark of yuck. Prometheus returns Scott to the primal black-ribbed universe of the former--yes its a prequel and that should have been a selling point not some coy marketers secret. Even while the confused new film begins in the earthly setting of a cascading waterfall (where a humanoid with enviably ripped abs contributes his DNA to the primordial soup) youre counting the seconds before a space-bound crew is defrosted thousands of years later from those cool-looking coffins for a debriefing on its mission Find the origins of us. Going for the ride is Elizabeth (Swedens Noomi Rapace the original dragon-tattooed girl) a fearless anthropologist who along with her boyfriend has faith in suggestive cave paintings. Theres also David (Michael Fassbender) the helpful-but-icy android a fixture of the franchise. Predictably he possesses a fickle agenda that at one moment has him watching Lawrence of Arabia for grooming tips at another poisoning an unlucky soul with microbial goop. Meanwhile Charlize Therons company woman looks upon all with Id-rather-be-at-Pilates contempt. The setup is familiar--the mysterious planet the slick tunnels the shocking bodily violation the broken quarantine etc. So why is there a gaping hole where the dread should be? The script partly credited to Losts Damon Lindelof is so filled with talky lectures about divinity (and boner plot holes) that you realize with embarrassment that Scott at age 74 wants to join the cosmic company of Terrence Malick. Does he not think that making a drum-tight horror film was ambitious enough? Instead were forced to ruminate on the motivations of the ancient ""engineers"" when the one engineer who really needed to be on deck takes a coffee break. Calling Prometheus--or any Ridley Scott movie--gorgeous is the stingiest of compliments (hes the director who was able to make the original Macintosh computer sexy). So lets point out specifics that quicken the pulse. Croaking from underneath a vat of old-age makeup Guy Pearce is a remarkably sinister quest-funding billionaire. And theres a doozy of a gross-out a computer-aided cesarean section that produces a squalling tentacled mess the near-mother-to-be quickly stapled shut by robotic arm. You laugh at the ridiculousness of it all the brusque efficiency of the procedure until it occurs to you If Scott wanted another Alien so badly couldnt he have torn it out quick simple and dirty like we all hoped?

Photo Twentieth Century Fox Ridley Scotts Alien prequel Prometheus has practically none of the 1979 originals visceral punch (for once I can use that adjective literally) but also none of its dumb false scares or stupefying stretches in which characters on the verge of being skewered by a giant black monster with a glistening ovoid helmet-head search the bowels of a spaceship for a remarkably uninteresting cat. Its a different sort of experience a stately somewhat plodding but endurable science-fiction saga that opens with the dawn of life on Earth and closes with mad carnage and a mystery even more troubling than how we humans got here. Along the way I thought of 2001 The Thing (Hawks and Carpenters) and all those fifties sci-fi pictures that ended with ""Keep watching the skies"" or a quivering ""?"" I thought of Lawrence of Arabia mostly because the movies requisite robot-with-a-secret David (Michael Fassbender) watches David Leans epic over and over and picks up Peter OTooles pansexual wonderment as well as excellent posture. I thought of how nice it was to watch a Ridley Scott picture with no epic battle scenes for him to screw up. Scott might be the most overrated director alive but hes decent at slower tempos. If you recall your first Alien encounter youll be pleased to hear Prometheus offers an explanation for the enormous vaguely humanoid skeleton at the controls of a spaceship on the moon where all but one of the crew of the Nostromo were gorily finished off. In the prequels prologue a spaceship drops a bluish well-muscled super-being off in a new world beside a mighty cataract after which the fellow takes a pill and comes apart in ways that will be of interest to Darwinians creationists and alien-autopsy nuts alike. The rest of the film centers on a trip a few zillion years later (give or take) to the aforementioned anti-hospitable moon where our heroine Dr. Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and her partner/lover Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) hope to find the ancestors of aliens that left pictograms all over Earth along the lines of ""Second star to the right and straight on till morning. BYOB."" A vast corporation has bankrolled the pairs supposedly scientific expedition -- but no corporation in an Alien movie has a non-nefarious agenda. Director Scott has an agenda too starting with showing his female stars in their scanties a la the young Sigourney Weaver. Charlize Theron as the steely corporate rep Meredith Vickers begins her half-naked workout the moment she emerges from her sleep pod and then slips into a gray bodysuit that hugs her splendid form like an asp skin. Rapaces character is wobblier out of the pod which means she doesnt get her big undies scene until much later when she performs a bit of grisly self-surgery that should inspire the pro-choice movement for millennia to come. Misused in the last (lousy) Sherlock Holmes picture the Swedish actress is a charming English-language heroine not too hard not too soft just tremulous enough to make her ultimate resourcefulness a happy surprise -- although the cross she has to wear to suggest her characters stubborn doctrinal faith is more like a cross she has to bear. The males are less memorable. In the show-off robot role Fassbender is amusingly fey but nothing can make the does-he-or doesnt-he-have-free-will question less hokey. Guy Pearce wears a few pounds of aging makeup as Weyland the elderly head of the Weyland Corporation suggesting that whatever the expedition finds will restore the moguls youth. (At the end of the movie you might find yourself asking Why not just cast an older actor?) Prometheus has a few sensational effects among them flying electronic ""pups"" that map out the vast alien cavern. The build-up to the first bloodbath (which is well over an hour in) is wittily prolonged. The climax is satisfying. But when all is said and done -- most of the secrets revealed and chests busted -- nothing has replaced the influence of artist H.R. Giger that suffused the 1979 original. Although its basically an ultra-fancy B scare picture with nothing on its mind except making you feel violated Alien remains the key text in the ""body horror"" subgenre that flowered (or depending on your viewpoint festered) in the seventies and Gigers designs covered all possible avenues of anxiety. Men traveled through vulva-like openings got forcibly impregnated and died giving birth to rampaging gooey vaginas dentate -- hows that for future shock? This was truly what David Cronenberg would call ""the new flesh"" a dissolution of the boundaries between man and machine machine and alien and man and alien with a psychosexual invasiveness that has never thank God been equaled. Prometheus tells a much bigger story and does it well but its missing what matters most. Its inorganic.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 08 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Jun. 08 2012 937AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Ridley Scott Written by Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof Starring Michael Fassbender Noomi Rapace Charlize Theron Classification 14A Country USA Language English With his most celebrated films - Blade Runner Alien Thelma amp; Louise Gladiator - director Ridley Scott has liked his canvases large and his stories epic. Even that female buddy flick ended on a mid-air freeze-frame over a precipice as if he couldnt bear to let his heroines come back down to earth. These are all sizable films significant in themselves and their influence. However works that are grand can still lack grandeur and Scotts canon suffers when compared to the best of other big-canvas specialists - lacking the intellectual rigour of Kubrick the painterly sweep of Lean the technological bravado of Cameron. In his latest Prometheus the gods are defied but that trend isnt Theres definite mastery here but its hardly a masterpiece. Prometheus trailer YouTube Multimedia Prometheus the official trailer Certainly theres no mistaking the epic note at the outset and Scott sustains it beautifully through the first third of the movie. The initial sequences are an expansion and reversal of that iconic tableau from Kubricks 2001 A Space Odyssey when the prehistoric bone morphs into an orbiting spaceship. Here The opening shot travels across a landscape of rugged splendour before isolating a hovering saucer-shaped craft.Then the reversal sees a team of earthbound archaeologists burrowing into ancient caves to discover eerie similarities in the primitive drawings - each one replicates an identical pattern a depiction of a distant solar system that perhaps gave birth to us. So this is an origins story and thus a prequel - not only to humankind but since it loosely picks up some of the same plot threads of Alien too.Consequently the crew of the Prometheus a corporate-sponsored aggregation of astronauts and deep thinkers sets forth to live up to its name - heading out on a galactic quest to gain crucial knowledge and no doubt pay a vast price for the privilege. We watch them awakening from their period of prolonged ""stasis"" - Charlize Theron in her dainties Noomi Rapace ditto plus various other geologists and flyboys. The exception is David who having no need of the big sleep has spent his time more constructively - watching Leans Lawrence of Arabia dying his hair Peter OToole blonde and practising to put some inflection into his vocal monotone. Yep David is a robot. Thanks to Michael Fassbender David is also a robot who steals the whole picture but more about that later.As the voyagers land and disembark to explore a pyramidal structure protruding from the topography Scotts large canvas continues to offer large rewards. Theres a majestic thrill and a real suspense to these scenes - after all hanging in the balance is nothing less than the identity of our creator. Indeed for once science and religion are united in a shared vision - on this expedition Darwin could comfortably hold hands with the Pope. Whats more when David deploys his superior brainpower to activate a hologram in the pyramids recesses the universe unfolds in gorgeous 3-D - its a pleasure dome of rare delight and the frame pops with Kubrickian magic. Heres where Fassbender particularly shines serving up the epiphany with delicate perfection. His robot can feel no fear but apparently hes not immune to blue-eyed wonder - neither are we.Unfortunately this is the movie and Scott at their zenith. When alien words are found inscribed on the structures interior the language is meant to be arcane but instead it plays like the writing on the wall with the signs of trouble easy to read. Suddenly the script loses that carefully wrought mystery and plunges into slimy confusion. Enter the octapussy critters followed by the action equivalent of old Prometheus getting his liver plucked out. Bodies implode heads get decapitated and the unfortunate Noomi finds herself impregnated with something thats ""not exactly a traditional fetus"" - her behemoth-in-the-oven dilemma gives rise to a self-performed C-section that earns an A for risibility.The dialogue slides down the same overwrought slope (""Sometimes to create we must destroy"") dragging along the plot towards a climax that makes up in obscurity what it lacks in punch. At this late stage the canvas seems to shrink and what felt major turns minor leaving Prometheus to a sadly familiar fate - chained to a rock of its creators own making.Ridley Scotts Top TroikaAlien (1979)Only his second feature this is sci-fi horror at its tightest - the plot taut the mood dark and the setting evocatively confined. It also introduced a preoccupation that Scott would expand in Thelma amp;; Louise the strong yet vulnerable female heroine.Blade Runner (1982)The considered pacing divided audiences initially but since then this dystopian film (especially the subsequent directors cut) has attracted a mass following to become Scotts most admired work - an exemplar of cyberpunk mated to classic noir.Gladiator (2000)Set-dressed to the IXs his Oscar-winning Gladiator revived the ""sword and sandal"" genre. The spectacle may have owed an obvious debt to Kubricks Spartacus yet the cultural influence proved immediate - it was the favourite much-discussed flick of Tony Soprano and the boys.

The films marketing campaign has been extravagantly coy on the question. Scott himself has allowed merely that ""the keen fan will recognize strands of Aliens DNA."" Its an odd if calculated reticence for an era in which nearly every cinematic undertaking is desperate to associate itself with a known ""brand"" however distant the relation. Forty-five-year-old naval board game reimagined as an alien-invasion movie? Check. Cult vampire soap opera flattened into a generic chapter of the ongoing Tim Burton-Johnny Depp weirdothon? Check. Blockbuster superhero franchise rebooted a mere five years after it was put on the shelf? Check back in a month. ""The ideas tackled in this film are unique large and provocative"" Scott says and hes right provided one also appends hokey shallow and confused. In any case notwithstanding Scotts disavowals the answer is yes Prometheus is a prequel to Alien and one need hardly be a keen fan to notice. Although the connection is not made absolutely explicit until late in the film it is evident almost from the opening frames. Following two prologues--one in which a humanoid alien seeds the primordial Earth with his own DNA and another in which archaeologists discover ancient cave drawings that point to a distant planet--we again find ourselves on a spaceship with a decidedly familiar cast of crewmates. Theres the tough-but-pretty female protagonist Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace); the corporate tool with a hidden agenda Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron); the mannered creepy android David (Michael Fassbender); and the likable-enough-that-he-is-almost-certainly-doomed crewmember Janek (Idris Elba). Rounding out the cast is the usual alien-fodder of braggarts and cowards.The year is 2093 and the ship is the Prometheus just arriving at the planet in the cave drawings after a two-year voyage. The crew is gradually awakened from their long cryogenic sleep by Fassbenders David--who if youve seen the actor in Shame and A Dangerous Method is about the last fellow youd want around while you spent several months unconscious. David for his part has spent the journey teaching himself a variety of ancient languages and obsessively re-watching Lawrence of Arabia. (""The trick William Potter is not minding that it hurts"" he mouths in sync with Peter OToole.)The ships mission--or at least the one we know about from the start--is to search the planet for signs of an alien race that Elizabeth and her partner/lover Charlie (Logan Marshall-Green) call the ""engineers."" She suspects (and we having seen the prologue can confirm) that in the distant past these advanced beings created the human race using their own DNA.The ship quickly finds a massive dome-like structure full of catacombs and the crew duly sets out to explore it. If you have seen other installments of the Alien franchise you can guess--at least in broad contours--what happens next alien artifacts are discovered; slimy viscous substances begin to ooze; crewmembers are separated and of necessity abandoned; unsavory things start going bump in the night. Those back on the ship detect something moving in the dark tunnels and warn those left behind who reply (reasonably enough) ""Pings? Clicks? Life forms? What the fuck"" Prometheus is at its best at moments such as these when extraterrestrial nightmares are slithering and undulating and finding novel ways to burrow into the bodies of their hapless human prey. (There is also the films most queasily memorable sequence in which Elizabeth is trying to get one out.) To this end the film borrows liberally from the Alien saga (in particular the first and third installments) John Carpenters The Thing and David Cronenbergs ""venereal horror"" period. MORE ON MOVIES Confessions of a Hollywood Viral-Marketing Fanboy 10 Cannes Films Youll Probably Want to See Our Picks for Which Film to Catch Each Week of Summer The De-Disneyfication of Fairy Tales Alas Scott is not content with such grotesque delights and aims for something larger a contemporary 2001 A Space Odyssey. As the director put it ""the ideas tackled in this film are unique large and provocative"" and I suppose those terms more or less apply provided one also appends hokey shallow and confused. Elizabeths character is one of those rare creatures--more alien to Hollywood than any extraterrestrial--known as ""practicing Christians."" Perhaps inevitably her faith is the source of a great deal of category confusion over the difference between belief in God and curiosity about the alien beings who manufactured humankind--the latter a subject that I suspect would interest Richard Dawkins as much as anyone. Moreover the script by Jon Spaihts and Lost guru Damon Lindelof is an utter mess. The twists that unspool in the movies latter hour frequently adhere to no discernable logic and character motivation is all but banished outright from the proceedings. Why does one member of the crew deliberately incubate not one but two alien monstrosities? Because otherwise the FX team wouldnt have anything to do (In a similar vein 45-year-old Guy Pearce is cast as a wizened nonagenarian for no apparent purpose other than to demonstrate the skill of the makeup crew.) It all leads up to a conclusion so false and off-key that it is borderline astonishing.Which is a shame because Prometheus is ravishing to look at with exceptional art direction set design and cinematography (by Dariusz Wolski). The way the ship alights on the planet with engines pointed downward like a crouching pit bull; the hurricane of silicate shards that rushes over the ship and its crew; a C-section of harrowing ferocity--if the film were merely the sum of its better parts it would be a rare treat. (I should note too that the menagerie of slimy aliens is first rate and Fassbender is just as good playing an irony-enabled android as one might hope.)Alas the movie gets lost in its philosophical meanderings and narrative cul de sacs. Scott had it right Prometheus--like in its telling the human race itself--is a creation spliced from the DNA of superior forebears.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you.

And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion. Continue Reading Stephanie Loos/Reuters The Elusive Manipulative Adopted Child Tina Traster Learning how to bond with my daughter who found comfort in the familiarity of being alone has come through understanding reactive attachment disorder. My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

As Hurricane Katrina raged through New Orleans in 2005 neighborhood after neighborhood collapsed from flooding. Of the houses that stood many still had to be bulldozed due to mold within the walls. But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

Most of the best effects in Prometheus are lifted from director Ridley Scotts Alien and the films meditations on life and the universe dont amount to much. By Peter Rainer Film critic June 7 2012 Save for later Saved Prometheus actress Noomi Rapace (center) is game but isnt given much to do. Kerry Brown/20th Century Fox/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Ridley Scott has made two iconic sci-fi films ""Alien"" (1979) and ""Blade Runner"" (1982). Trying for a hat trick with ""Prometheus"" he comes up short.Ill say this much for it - its not boring. How could it be when it features sequences like the one in which the heroine gives herself a self- administered Caesarean and out pops an alien?That heroine circa 2093 is scientist Elizabeth Shaw played by Noomi Rapace in a frisky manner about as far removed as can be from her somnolent girl with a dragon tattoo. Recommended 2012 movies 10 to look for Elizabeth and her scientist boyfriend Charlie (Logan Marshall-Green) have hit on the theory that aliens created earthlings. Heading up the spaceship Prometheus she hopes to make contact with the creators on the desolate planet she believes beckons us. Of course once the spaceship has landed the alien malevolence kicks in and you can forget about all that we-come-in-peace stuff. 2012 movies 10 to look for Video Chris Vognar and Robert Wilonsky on Prometheus Monitor Movie Guide Scott makes functional use of 3-D here and most of his best shock effects like that alien birth are lifted from ""Alien."" (The film at one time was engineered as a prequel to ""Alien"" but that notion seems to have evaporated.) Charlize Theron in the same witchy mode as in ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" plays the on-board corporate honcho. The films most creepily amusing character is Michael Fassbenders David the spaceships supersmart android who patterns his movements and diction on Peter OToole in ""Lawrence of Arabia"" his favorite film.Rapace is game as Elizabeth but doesnt get much to do except look alternately blissed-out terrified and poleaxed. The films meditations on The Meaning of It All dont amount to much. Elizabeth conspicuously wears a cross around her neck and declares that she is ""willing to discount three centuries of Darwinism."" As for the ""creators"" and why they want to obliterate their creation if you stick out the end credits youll notice a sequel is in the offing. As if you hadnt already guessed that.

He hasnt returned to the realm of sci-fi in the three decades since but between plans for a sequel to the latter and this weekends ""Prometheus"" a distant prequel to the former Scott is returning to the genre well with no shortage of panache or heady concepts at hand. Whether those concepts fundamentally compensate for the occasionally rough-hewn execution that follows remains up for debate. Through glimpses of violence on a cellular level the wordless prologue aptly establishes the ominous/opaque tone and primary creative/destructive themes. We then jump forward from what would appear to be the beginning of Life as We Know It on Earth to the year 2089 A.D. when archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) discover cave paintings in Scotland that corroborate their theory that someone out there -- ""Engineers"" -- has made the same impression on several civilizations across thousands of years and wants to be found. For him its the pursuit of science; for her its a quest for God. Its 2093 by the time mogul Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce beneath an unfortunate amount of old-age makeup) bankrolls their trillion-dollar expedition to the farthest reaches of our universe aboard the spaceship Prometheus and along with corporate liaison Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) android associate David (Michael Fassbender) ships captain Janek (Idris Elba) and others Shaw and Holloway touch down on LV-223 and enter the nearest pyramid they can find -- home to ancient corpses countless capsules of goo and a statue of a human head. Before I say anymore and before anyone else can say ""Dont take off your helmets"" and ""Dont touch anything"" best laid plans do very much go awry. Until that point and even after Scott maintains an admirable scale to the entire enterprise allowing the eponymous ship to be dwarfed by the magnitude of space skies and structures alike and capturing every environment in gorgeous 3-D. The awe of the first hour is only bolstered by Marc Streitenfelds score initially indebted more to the rousing themes of John Williams than to Jerry Goldsmiths eerie original compositions. However Prometheus was the tale of the Titan who gave fire to us mortals and was punished for stealing it from the Gods; ""Prometheus"" adheres closer to the legend of Icarus in that it struggles to soar as it draws closer to things big bold and bright. The ostensibly educated minds aboard begin to behave even dumber than their blue-collar brethren on the Nostromo and once sex and drugs enter the picture its hard to ignore the slasher horror tradition that follows albeit in glossier gorier fashion. The anonymous half of a crew of 17 await extermination while the bigger stars ping-pong back and forth between the pyramid and the ship and the larger more fascinating ""Frankenstein"" variation thats busy toying with the lofty dichotomy of faith vs. science becomes interrupted by a half-hearted family tragedy in the classical mold. Its hard to know whether Jon Spaihts original screenplay or Damon Lindelofs subsequent rewrites are responsible for the hasty revelations and hidden motivations to come or how much vital character development found its way to the cutting room floor before leads who have hardly interacted before find themselves agreeing on a deadly course of action. Others who fled a scene to specifically avoid trouble find themselves inexplicably stranded all the same if only to help pick off the equally ancillary characters milling about. Theres a terrifically tense surgical sequence in the middle of the film that strains logic even as it shreds nerves and that scene is itself wedged in between a rushed series of considerable deaths developments and reveals none of which seems to carry much weight to our lead beyond the immediate physical toll. Rapace carries those burdens well though struggling to give her philosophical dilemmas comparable weight to the frequent physical peril. Marshall-Green is a bit more foolhardy and harder to like for it. Theron begins as the steely voice of reason before bending her performance to the will of a most improbable subplot while Elbas more pragmatic role permits him to most directly channel the working-man charms of ""Aliens"" original cast. Above all towers Fassbenders understated turn as David a soulless creation who nonetheless seems to spite his human creators and operates with eerie precision towards cryptic ends. While they sleep he alternates between watching their dreams and taking in ""Lawrence of Arabia"" as if seeking advice on how best to handle stolen fire. Even as the plots ambiguity borders on outright inscrutability Fassbender operates with a distinct if unspoken sense of purpose that leaves scenes less fascinating without him. Thankfully that pervasive sense of dread sustains itself for long enough to offset the films frustrating need to introduce a clear-cut baddie and sequel signposts. (After all its no spoiler to point out that this project takes place before the crew of the Nostromo has even been born.) Alas this is the messy business of having a few too many engineers attempt to simultaneously evolve a franchise both forwards and backwards. In the end Ridley Scott means to bring wonder and horror back to summertime spectacle and ""Prometheus"" mostly succeeds in that regard. (Mostly.) As David himself might advise in the borrowed words of T.E. Lawrence the trick to enjoying it is not minding its faults.

(AP Foto/20th Century Fox) Photo Kerry Brown Associated Press Prometheus review Brooding sci fi 1 / 5 Back to Gallery Prometheus Science fiction. Starring Noomi Rapace Michael Fassbender and Charlize Theron. Directed by Ridley Scott. (R. 124 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Prometheus"" has the integrity of a serious and sincere attempt but ultimately it wont please anybody. Those going into it expecting a fast crowd-pleasing sci-fi action thriller will be disappointed - ""Prometheus"" is not that kind of movie. Its ambitions are in another direction to be a brooding and penetrating contemplation of the origins of humanity and the nature of existence. At the same time those who go into ""Prometheus"" looking for a deep existential experience may also be disappointed. Try as it might the movie is hardly profound and the murky atmosphere and the leaden pace drag things down. Aside from a handful of first-rate sequences - Ridley Scott directed so there were bound to be some of those - most of the film consists of long dull stretches interspersed by the sudden appearance of ugly stomach-turning aliens. Much is revealed by the movies look. It takes place in the late 21st century mostly on a spaceship and apparently the fad at the end of this century is going to be mood lighting because the sets are dimly lit and exist in a blue haze. Two people will be having a conversation but theyll look like dark blue silhouettes against a light blue background. Even on the ships deck no one seems to bother to turn on the lights. The scenes on an alien planet are just as gloomy. Most take place in a cave illuminated only by flashlights and various futuristic devices and even when people get out of the cave the planet is consistently overcast. The atmospherics say volumes about the artistic aspiration behind ""Prometheus"" and also about its failure to be anything an audience might want to look at. All the movies good news involves Noomi Rapace the Swedish actress heretofore best known for her performances in the Swedish ""Girl"" movies. She is the moral locus of ""Prometheus"" a scientist who has developed a thesis about the creation of humankind based on her study of early cave paintings. Rapace is an actress of focus and dimensionality very clear in her thinking driven and vulnerable and yet when the time comes for her to be strong theres no doubting her. Anyone who wants to make a case for ""Prometheus"" on the basis of a single scene needs to look no further than the tour de force in which Rapace plays a woman overcoming excruciating pain in order to perform an emergency medical procedure. Well say no more about it except that thats the scene to take from the movie and its what everyone will be talking about Friday night. Rapace can look forward to a long American career. The ensuing space expedition is a quest to find God. Dr. Shaw (that is Rapace) and her partner believe that they have located the specific point in the galaxy where the gods who founded civilization are located. They are seekers keyed into the spiritual side of science while Charlize Theron as the representative of the corporation funding the expedition is more interested in money. When they arrive on the distant planet Dr. Shaw and her team get out and start looking around. They are accompanied by a very human-looking robot played by Michael Fassbender and oddly enough Fassbender has never been better. In most of his previous performances Fassbender showed a habit of reflexively pushing his characters in the direction of weakness diffidence and regret even when it wasnt appropriate. But here he cant do that. He is straitjacketed by a character who has no emotion and the result is that he turns in a performance of quiet menace wit and subtlety. Its a lesson in how an actor can sometimes achieve more by doing less. Most of the space exploration in ""Prometheus"" is presented as so workaday and methodical that the movie could almost be called a space procedural. For about an hour the story goes almost nowhere and takes its time getting there. The last 45 minutes are more lively and some will consider the movie redeemed on that basis. But even then the pall of murk remains over the proceedings making this a movie one for special tastes only.   Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

(20th Century Fox Licensing/Merch) ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" was about an astronaut named Dave traveling to the far reaches of the universe to find the secret to mans origins on Earth. ""Prometheus"" is totally different This time the spaceman is named ""David."" But from the opening shot of ""Prometheus"" which is a direct quotation of the Stanley Kubrick magnum opus its clear that Ridley Scotts intense and engulfing adventure-horror-sci-fi flick is honoring its predecessors (including ""Avatar"" and Scotts ""Blade Runner"" and ""Alien"" to which this film is an unofficial prequel). Gorgeous set pieces thrill the senses but there is philosophical inquiry as well. ""Alien"" was after all just ""Jaws"" in space but ""Prometheus"" ponders where evil comes from and how it conquers its makers. Kubrick wouldnt have been quite so interested in all the flamethrower killings and exploding guts that entrance Sir Ridley but Stanley could be a bit of a drudge. ""Prometheus"" is wickedly entertaining scary sinister and thought-provoking. But Im not sure it will hold up on TV. See it on the big screen and in 3-D As with ""Avatar"" youre paying not for rounded characters or a smoothly engineered story but for a maximum-cinema experience -- the majesty and wonder conjured up by a pop maestro who knows how to spend a couple of hundred million bucks. PHOTOS CHARLIZE THERON AND MORE STARS FACING OFF AGAINST THEMSELVES AT THE BOX OFFICE We begin in ancient times with a Dawn of Man sequence involving a giant alien and a Thermos of the Gods that serves as the monolith did in ""2001."" In 2089 newly discovered cave drawings reporting the alien contact inspire a pair of scientists (Noomi Rapace of the original ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" and Logan Marshall-Green) to lead a mission to a distant nook of the galaxy to find the godlike ""engineers"" who got things rolling on Earth. The scientists are accompanied by a blond robot (Michael Fassbender) who apparently went to the same language school as C-3PO and has a fixation on ""Lawrence of Arabia."" Science has always had to defer to patrons though and the true boss (Charlize Theron a human icicle) is the leader of the corporation funding the trillion-dollar experiment. The ancient deceased founder of the company who appears in a hologram (hes played by Guy Pearce under a wall of makeup and Scott squanders a chance for a tender human element by not hiring a genuinely old actor with gravitas) explains that like Prometheus who tried to raise man to the level of the gods he was driven to uncover the ultimate secret. Who made us? Are they nice? And what exactly are the chances that scary acid-bleeding monsters in caves will shred us like lettuce if we should nose around asking a few polite questions? The middle of the movie is too much of a monster mosh pit. By the time we get around to the mutant crab-man it seems like the lads in special effects are just amusing themselves and a soon-to-be-infamous scene illustrating how to do surgery on yourself doesnt really belong. On the other hand what kind of ""Alien"" movie would this be if gushing innards and ripped flesh werent on the menu? You want a Wes Anderson film theres one playing next door. Another failing is Scotts lack of engagement with character. David the robot (who is less like Dave Bowman than HAL 9000 with shades of Jude Law in ""A.I."") is the only one who gets a little time to show us who he is and though the scientists intriguingly have Christian convictions which yield the thrilling (to fellow believers) line ""Wheres my cross?"" Scott doesnt do as much with science versus religion as he could have. Like his writers Damon Lindelof and Jon Spaihts Scott loves equally the colossal and the claustrophobic but people kind of bore him. This didnt bother me much because there is so much else going on. With its creepy caves and yawning space ""Prometheus"" is on one level a somber dialogue between man the aspirant and man the mortal. Too often a freely wandering soul discovers but a new kind of prison; our most protracted journeys take place in coach between two screaming toddlers.

Starring Noomi Rapace Michael Fassbender Charlize Theron Kate Dickie Rafe Spall Logan Marshall-Green Idris Elba Sean Harris Benedict Wong Emun Elliot Director Ridley Scott Release Opened Jun 8 2012  Editorial Review Bring expectations down to EarthBy Ann HornadayFriday June 8 2012""Prometheus"" began life as a prequel to ""Alien"" Ridley Scotts seminal 1979 science-fiction action film; along the way it became a stand-alone project its chief claim to fame being that it marked Scotts hotly anticipated return to the genre since his similarly genre-defining ""Blade Runner."" So the biggest surprise about ""Prometheus"" might be just how unoriginal it is given Scotts track record as a genre game-changer. Visually impressive and featuring one or two breakout performances this anticlimactic exercise too often plays as though it has been cobbled together from archetypes imagery and tropes from countless other movies. The disappointment takes its time settling in after a promising overture during which Scotts camera swoops majestically over an otherworldly landscape a portentous orchestral score signaling that rather than traffic in pulpy escapism ""Prometheus"" intends to take itself very seriously. Soon enough we meet the principal players of ""Prometheus"" Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) and Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) archeologists who are leading a group of explorers in the year 2089 when they happen upon a cave of futuristic dreams. Wall paintings confirm their competing theories regarding the extraterrestrial source of life. When the action picks up a few years later Holloway Shaw and their ragtag team -- overseen by chilly corporate honcho Meredith Vickers (played by Charlize Theron in a witchy turn in keeping with a similar character in ""Snow White and the Huntsman"") -- have boarded a spacecraft called Prometheus which under the sponsorship of Weyland Industries is taking them to an undisclosed location and presumably to the origin of the human species itself. At least thats the fondest wish of Shaw who as portrayed by Rapace (best known as the Swedish actress who played Lisbeth Salander in the first version of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"") emerges as one of the movies most nuanced characters a scientist as compelled by her belief in God as by cold hard facts. Holloway her love interest is supposedly her opposite number believing in Darwin rather than a higher being. But the role of spiritual other half by rights belongs to the starships valet a serenely servile android named David played by Michael Fassbender in a performance reminiscent of David Bowies ""The Man Who Fell to Earth"" Dirk Bogardes ""The Servant"" and Peter OTooles ""Lawrence of Arabia"" which David studies assiduously to learn how to be human. As always Fassbender delivers an assured and subtle performance of superb control and physical expressiveness but the fact that his references are made so explicit is of a piece with ""Prometheuss"" derivative style which nods to everything from ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" to ""Star Trek"" as Shaw and her crew explore a darkly forbidding planet. (Even the holographic ghosts that they momentarily encounter seem vaguely reminiscent of something else -- in this case of Tupac Shakurs recent posthumous appearance at the Coachella music festival.) Scott can always be relied upon to create bold visual designs in his movies and ""Prometheus"" is no exception The movie looks good -- from the ships crammed bridge and Vickerss snow-white Swarovski-chandeliered cabin to the glyphs cylindrical ruins and biomorphic pod-shapes that dominate the labyrinthine pyramid where the crew does most of its intergalactic spelunking. Its a pity that Scott climbed onto the 3-D bandwagon for ""Prometheus."" Its striking visuals arent enhanced but undermined by the effect -- here utterly devoid of depth or surprise even when slithering albino space-lampreys begin to pop out where theyre least expected. If it beggars belief that an otherwise intelligent scientist (played in the film by Rafe Spall) would actually reach out and touch a hissing alien cobralike life form how else will ""Prometheus"" get to the goopy parts? Rest assured it does get goopy -- not to mention gory and grotesque from a nasty subcutaneous worm infestation to a climactic sequence involving a self-administered surgical procedure that manages to be risible repulsive and rapaciously sadistic at the same time. All the God-talk and philosophical musings about morality and ""meeting our makers"" aside ""Prometheus"" is primarily about delivering those visceral terrifying jolts. That it does so without generating the taut suspense and moody atmosphere of its antecedents qualifies as one of its greatest failings. Then there are the myriad loose ends from a maddeningly random unresolved moment between Vickers and Prometheuss salty-dog pilot Janek (Idris Elba) and a confounding episode involving David and Holloway to the fundamental question -- why destroy what you go to the trouble to create? -- that lingers after the inevitable carnage ensues. Presumably some of those questions are left open to create demand for a sequel to the erstwhile prequel of all the other sequels. But in the case of ""Prometheus"" that prospect is less a tantalizing promise than an idle ho-hum threat.Contains sci-fi violence including some intense images and brief profanity.

The production design is as memorable as it was in Scotts 1982 dark drama Blade Runner.In its first half hour as it strives to be both a spiritually tinged and provocative space thriller Prometheus feels headed toward exhilarating cinematic territory. But what could have been a heady sci-fi epic falls short mostly because of a scattershot story that loses steam and leaves loose ends hanging in a plot that tries to cover too much ground. Its almost as if Scott and the other screenwriters were unsure about the ultimate meaning of the story.STORY Ridley Scotts Prometheus keeps fans guessingVIDEO Charlize Theron Guy Pearce talk PrometheusMORE Stephen Hawking inspires PrometheusThe films title refers to the name of the ship as well as to the Greek Titan who helped create humans and stole fire to help mankind. Prometheus is filled with murky mythology in its tale of space explorers bound for a distant planet to gather clues about the origins of human life on Earth.Archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and her partner Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) discover a recurring cross-cultural pictogram that shows human figures pointing toward a distinct planet formation. About the moviePrometheus out of fourStars Michael Fassbender Noomi Rapace Logan Marshall-Green Charlize Theron Guy Pearce Idris Elba Director Ridley ScottDistributor 20th Century Fox Rating R for sci-fi violence including some intense images and brief language Running time 2 hours 4 minutes Opens Friday nationwideOn the basis of this discovery they receive corporate sponsorship for an exploratory mission to a galaxy that fits the formation depicted. The pair is convinced that the creatures on the planet engineered the human race. Kept in suspended animation Shaw and Holloway awake aboard the ship in 2093 excited to meet their makers.The expedition was commissioned by ghostly corporate CEO Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) and is directed by steely Miss Vickers (Charlize Theron). Most of the scientific calculations are conducted by the ultra-precise and natty automaton David (Michael Fassbender). But his motives become murky. Does he act out of vengeance or sly humor? And if so is he man or machine?Enjoy four clips from PrometheusFassbender with his clipped speech and artfully arranged blond coif is a standout fully convincing as a robot. Rapace the eponymous star of 2009s The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo proves shes no one-hit wonder. The part calls for a blend of toughness and vulnerability she capably conveys. When it comes to technical wizardry and sheer visual spectacle Prometheus unequivocally delivers. Its easy to get lost in the films other-worldly beauty especially in its depiction of space landscapes and dreamlike visions.But while it begins as a mysterious tale of human creation the story devolves into a more generic battle to save the human race and pave the way for a sequel. All that buildup for such an anticlimactic payoff.Scott seduces audiences with thought-provoking possibilities then pulls a bait-and-switch subbing in a familiar monster thriller and fiery explosion-fest.

By CHRIS VOGNAR cvognardallasnews.com Movie Critic Published 07 June 2012 0459 PM Updated 12 June 2012 0123 PM Related See director Ridley Scott through the years before catching Prometheus Video Chris Vognar and Robert Wilonsky talk Prometheus in the Screening Room Poll Whats your favorite Ridley Scott movie? If the original Alien left crucial questions unanswered we certainly didnt think about it at the time. It was a stripped-down work of minimalist heart-in-the-throat terror that meticulously played on the audiences nerves and stomachs without probing too deeply into whys and wherefores.That was 33 years and umpteen sequels and directors ago. Now Ridley Scott has returned to extravagantly tie up some loose ends that only fans of the franchise knew existed. Prometheus doesnt just answer questions; it also raises a bunch. And theyre not just smallish plot matters. Scott and his screenwriters are hunting big existential game Who made us? Is it our place to find out? And is there gonna be a Sigourney Weaver cameo or what?The results of this belated Alien prequel can be ponderous and condescending (how many times do we have to see a cross pendant and hear variations of the phrase ""meet your maker"" before realizing the stakes are high here?). But Prometheus can also be magnificent especially when it marries its existential themes to a barren space world that takes advantage of the rare 3-D presentation actually worth plunking down cash for.Thirty years before the doomed freighter Nostromo answered that distress call at the start of Alien two idealistic archeologists-lovers (Noomi Rapace sans dragon tattoo and Logan Marshall-Green) discover cave paintings that point them to a distant planet. Onboard the snazzy ship that gives the movie its philosophically loaded name they head for the stars along with an icy corporate scion (Charlize Theron) the calmly macho ships captain (Idris Elba) a pair of scientists (Rafe Spall and Sean Harris) and a boyish android (Michael Fassbender) obsessed with Lawrence of Arabia.Fassbender tends to be among the best reasons to watch whatever movie hes in and Prometheus is no exception. The Alien series has had its share of android troublemakers -- you generally cant trust them -- but none were this beguiling and impish.Fassbenders David also finds himself at the center of the movies best visual effects. As he unlocks some data system or another the screen explodes with a kind of intergalactic atlas that seems to envelop the viewer from all angles. Want to see a movie shot (extremely well) in 3-D instead of one that sloppily tacks on the effect? See Prometheus.The movies Big Questions hark back to 2001 A Space Odyssey and serve up for food for thought when theyre not bludgeoning you over the head. They also work well enough in tandem with the cosmic visual scope of a lonely planet that alas isnt lonely enough. Think of Prometheus as the Garbo response to Close Encounters of the Third Kind We are not alone but we should want to be.And if you just want some good scares youll find them here alongside the weighty considerations. Scotts horror timing remains impeccable. If you have fond 33-year-old memories of averting your young eyes from a propulsive parasite critter Prometheus might just be your kind of return trip.On Twitter chrisvognarPROMETHEUS (B+)Directed by Ridley Scott.

(Twentieth Century Fox) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday June 7 2012 510 PM Title Prometheus Film Info With Charlize Theron Michael Fassbender Noomi Rapace. A space exploration discovers monstrous horror. Director Ridley Scott. (204) R Violence gore. Area theaters. In 3D. Is it necessary for a science-fiction epic to fulfill the big ideas it promises or is just the promise enough these days? And if that epic delivers on thrills frights and mammoth landscape does it lose points when what it could have attempted -- philosophically cinematically -- haunts the film as much as its accomplishments? And if the movie in question is Ridley Scotts ""Prometheus"" -- a gargantuan thing beginning with its mythic title and a movie that plants a seed for subsequent viewings despite its problems -- is it just a reflection of what we want the movie to be? It comes down to something the films characters ask too. Why are we here? Were here at ""Prometheus"" to see the beginnings of the ""Alien"" universe the one that began with Scotts 1979 horror touchstone though this new work is tethered only to that classics opening act. Scientist Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) is on a spacecraft at the end of the 21st century to find the origins of mankind a leap of faith springing from the discovery of galaxy map cave drawings. RELATED SCOTT RETURNS TO ALIEN UNIVERSE RELATED THERON IS HOTTEST ACTRESS IN THE UNIVERSE Using that ""map"" the powerful Weyland corporation launches a 17-person expedition to find what Shaw calls ""Engineers"" (because they engineered us). Her boyfriend Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) is more of a skeptic but as they descend to a planet surface and find the remains of giant beings whose DNA perfectly match ours he too is awed. Then the scientists find a destructive black goo that may have been intended for Earth before the Engineers were massacred. It does bad things to those who touch it (or ingest it). But the ships steely secretive commander (Charlize Theron) and the android David (Michael Fassbender) have other plans which include keeping the ships captain (Idris Elba) from blasting off. Its hard to talk about ""Prometheus"" plot without giving away anything. It owes a lot to such classics as ""Forbidden Planet"" and ""2001 A Space Odyssey -- as well as the late great Ray Bradburys ""Martian Chronicles"" -- yet its constructed like a modern thriller Surprise is part of the fun. (A lot of buzz already surrounds an ""auto-surgery"" chamber scene where a wide-awake patient has some abdominal pain.) For all the jumps and jolts though what resonates in Scotts graceful grownup pristine film is its majestic mind. The opening moments set to a soaring orchestral score by Marc Streitenfeld contains hints of thought-provoking stuff that if carried out could have been mind-blowing. The movie pulls back though leaving us without a crucial connection it ought to have included. However we are left after all the propulsive action with great turns by Theron and Rapace and a tightly wound turn by Fassbender whose eerie poetically impish mechanical man might have burst from Bradburys conscience. All of them essentially are seeking a soul in ""Prometheus"" which makes us the same as them by design or not.

There they must fight a terrifying battle to save the future of the human race. Video courtesy of 20th Century Fox. By Joe Morgenstern June 7 2012 512 p.m. ET Ridley Scott has been quoted as saying that fans of ""Alien"" will recognize strands of its DNA in ""Prometheus."" Theyre impossible to miss both in the brilliant visuals and in some aspects of the plot. Yet his new film suffers from crucial chromosome breaks. What was then a model of narrative clarity and seductive suspense--""In space no one can hear you scream""--is now diffuse and often assaultive. In part that reflects the evolving priorities of the movie business in the intervening three decades. ""Prometheus"" in efficient 3-D places most of its bets on the wonders that todays visual artists and technicians can work with digital tools. This tale of an interstellar search asks cosmic questions about the meaning of life but comes up with lame answers in a script that screams attention-deficit disorder. ENLARGE Michael Fassbender in Prometheus. Twentieth Century Fox The searchers venture forth in a spaceship named after the Greek god who stole fire from Zeus and gave it to us mortals. Prometheus is owned by a vastly powerful corporation called Weyland Industries--that makes the vessel a kind of private Enterprise--and its diverse crew promises the pleasures of good pulp while that distinctive DNA promises the revulsion of gloppy gelatin. Two of the people on board are archaeologists Noomi Rapaces Shaw and her boyfriend Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green); they smooch when they can and tap helmets tenderly during extravehicular excursions. Theyre the ones whove persuaded Weyland to bankroll the mission on the basis of cave drawings that suggest the human race was created by higher beings--the archaeologists call them Engineers--and that specify a point in space as the workshop of these gods. Its a lot to infer from simple pictograms but Google Maps doesnt cover the territory. Ms. Rapace the singular Swedish star who played Lisbeth Salander in the Millennium Trilogy works hard and well on this movies behalf; shes never less than intense and a prodigy of endurance when she cranks up Shaws intensity to fever pitch. Charlize Therons Meredith Vickers represents Weylands interests. Severe in demeanor and tailored to perfection in outfits that suggest late 21st-century Armani Vickers is the ships Nurse Ratched. Shes meant to be mysterious with her own agenda but you wish shed lighten up and stop behaving like a robot. (At one point theres a suggestion that shes about to let loose although inexplicably we never get to see it happen.) Related Video Michael Fassbenders David is a robot and he steals the show. The theft is accomplished by a combination of smart writing and Mr. Fassbenders delectably minimalist technique. David is a walking smiling outwardly self-assured HAL who may have an agenda of his own. Possessed of childlike curiosity he studies Peter OToole in a video of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" for life lessons on how to behave. (""The trick William Potter is not minding that it hurts."") It says more than the filmmakers could have intended--Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof wrote the ragged script--that the movies most appealing character is a piece of machinery. This is because the pulp archetypes of human persuasion fall victim to excessive dumbing down--some of the scientists like the crew headed by Idris Elbas Janek talk like middle-school dropouts--or to stultifying self-seriousness. Shaw is a believer keeping her crucifix close for as long as she can and looking forward to meeting her literal maker. Holloway is a debunker unimpressed by the majesty of creation. The issues they debate hardly lack spiritual resonance (why did the Engineers make us and who made them?) but theyre debated so schematically and punched up so opportunistically (Shaw is sterile unable to create life herself) that the story seems to have been bolted together by engineering apprentices. Thats certainly not true of the deep-space vistas; theyre as soul-filling as the most ardent fan of ""Alien"" could have hoped for. (The deep-bass sound design is impressive too.) ""Prometheus"" is worth seeing for the quality of its sci-fi sights and not just the great outdoors in the far reaches of the cosmos. Mr. Scott and his collaborators--most notably the production designer Arthur Max and the cinematographer Dariusz Wolski--have created data-rich interiors with 3-D displays shimmering holograms and in one magical scene a sort of planetarium of the cosmos that springs up unbidden with a little Earth drifting around the perimeter. The director pioneered data richness in ""Blade Runner"" the now-peerless classic of future noir cum urban grunge. Here though theres a sense of randomness and too-muchness that characterizes the whole production including the hideous creatures that fulfill the promise of a horror show. They keep popping up in more forms with more lethal strategies than a besieged Earth brain can compute. The same too-muchness afflicts the action which is disorganized or preposterous when it isnt frenzied what with scientists wandering off heedlessly and touching stuff with reckless abandon. (They should have watched a video of ""Alien"" for lessons in how to behave.) The climax is spectacular yet the movies high point--which may also be the low point depending on your squeamishness level--is a ruthlessly clever sequence that the most ardent pro-life advocate might find justified in principle though appalling in fact. Thats followed by Shaw running around the spaceship like Medea on uppers. The running takes place in narrative limbo since no one else on the spaceship seems aware of her plight and she stumbles on a pivotal secret through an open door that should by the logic of the plot have been sealed and triple-locked. Yet this is the way things happen in ""Prometheus."" A movie about biology and life its all but devoid of connective tissue. Spoiled by their upbringing with no idea what wild life is really like four animals from New York Citys Central Park Zoo escape unwittingly assisted by four absconding penguins and find themselves in Madagascar among a bunch of merry lemurs. Video courtesy of Paramount Pictures. Madagascar 3 Europes Most Wanted Say what you will about the ""Madagascar"" franchise--and Ive said my share of skeptical things about the perfunctory plots--millions of people around the world have followed the exploits of the Central Park Zoo escapees and theyll surely turn out again. This third chapter in 3-D relocates its heroes from Africa to Monte Carlo where theyre pursued by a rabid animal-control officer. To evade her they join a broken-down traveling circus that takes them to Rome and London; along the way they help the dejected circus animals rediscover their passion. This plot is better than perfunctory--it plays on a classic theme of irrepressible Americans breathing new life into weary Europe. Whats striking this time is the perfunctory physics. ENLARGE A scene from Madagascar 3 Europes Most Wanted. DreamWorks Animation has always meant liberation from Newtonian constraints; elephants fly fragile creatures survive fierce collisions. Still cartoons have acknowledged those constraints in approximate ways; a squirrel does fall after soaring up and off a glaciers roller-coaster surface. ""Madagascar 3"" doesnt just bend the laws of physics it creates kinetic chaos by ignoring them and diminishes its impact in the process. Heres an example. The former star of the traveling circus a tiger named Vitaly has lost his nerve after an accident. Hes no longer able to perform his signature stunt leaping through a flaming ring the size of a wedding band. But how could he ever have done it? The stunt is patently impossible even in the carefree language of cartoons so its hard to be impressed when Vitaly finds the courage to do it again. And more to the point the stunt forces the animators to cheat; they can only show it from Vitalys perspective not from an objective point of view that might have given it some validity. In one sense this is a flea-size quibble; cartoons can do what they damned well please. But drama demands constraints; if theres nothing to push against physically as well as emotionally then nothings at stake. ""Madagascar 3"" is all about exuberant motion cute characters and gorgeous colors. It aims for the eyes not the heart. An uptight NYC lawyer takes her two teenagers to her hippie mothers farmhouse upstate for a family vacation. Video courtesy of IFC Films. Peace Love amp; Misunderstanding This childish comedy of conflicting values set mostly in contemporary Woodstock and directed by Bruce Beresford plays like a list of hippie cliches that must be included lest any trace of reality intrude. Wind chimes chime generic protesters demand peace in unspecified nations an ancient VW Beetle vies for screen time with a battered VW Microbus and everything but the village green is tie-dyed. The only rewards and they are real albeit insufficient involve watching Jane Fonda in full cry and Catherine Keener in a quieter fullness of feeling. Ms. Keener is Diane a conservative Manhattan lawyer. Newly wounded by her husbands demand for a divorce she packs her two kids into the car--theyre played by Elizabeth Olsen and Nat Wolff--and beats a retreat to the Catskills for a brief visit with her mother Ms. Fondas Grace. With her earth-mother mother that is. Happily stuck in the counterculture 60s Grace grows pot in the basement allows chickens free range in the kitchen takes generic studs to her bedroom or living-room couch and leaves no room for doubt about why Diane has avoided her for 20 years. ENLARGE Elizabeth Olsen Jane Fonda and Catherine Keener in Peace Love amp; Misunderstanding. IFC Films Was there no one to suggest that the script by Joseph Muszynski and Christina Mengert had certain deficits? All the same the spectacle of first-rate actors attacking third-rate material is guilty fun. And even though Dianes young son makes a nuisance of himself as a compulsive videographer the little film he finally puts together is unexpectedly touching for what it says of how the familys trip to Woodstock changed everyones lives. Unlike the surrounding movie its supposed to be amateurish. ENLARGE DVD Focus Jane Eyre (2011) Michael Fassbender is Rochester in Cary Fukunagas transfixing version of the Charlotte Bronte romance which stars Mia Wasikowska as Jane. Mr. Fassbenders lord of the cursed manor is worthy of his governesss love even though hes no match for the one played by Timothy Dalton when it comes to despair or towering rage and though he wisely doesnt imitate Orson Welless doomy self-regard in the role. Instead of a black hole taking energy in hes a pulsar pumping it out in the form of pain relieved at least for a while by wry humor and an openness to Janes beauty. Dumbo (1941) It doesnt have the historical significance of ""Snow White"" but seven decades havent diluted its appeal and the digital medium makes it almost a sure thing that those pink elephants are still parading in accurate colors. The film comes and goes in a mere 64 minutes but its filled with visual delights and unforgettably deep feelings. Todays moviegoers who often choose to see an animated feature on the strength of which famous actors have done the voices may find it surprising that neither Dumbo nor his mother ever say a word. Woodstock (1970) No concert film before or since has combined as many memorable performances with as much local color--cops looking the other way cameras looking every which way. But no other concert film has had such a vast and colorful canvas to feast its lenses on. Whether ""Woodstock"" does or doesnt stand at the top of its genre its a singular piece of reportage even anthropology (or archaeology) just as the Woodstock festival remains a singular event in the cultural life of the nation. The first-time director a cinematographer with the instincts of a documentarian was Michael Wadleigh.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Its nice to see old friends and on a purely nostalgic level Ridley Scotts return to the mythology of ""Alien"" gives us a grin on a double set of extending slavering jaws. ""Prometheus"" doubles down on the impeccable design editing and art direction that elevated Scotts 1979 space monster story to an electrifying adult horror masterpiece. Scott delivers a visually exquisite unmissable film that demands and deserves to be seen on the biggest screen available. It is also unforgivably stupid. For all its gloss and craftsmanship this is a rote ""final girl"" flick with tentacles. ""Alien"" was about more than a look. It was blessed by the sardonic tang of Dan OBannons screenplay a paranoid psychological thriller that tightened its screws with each narrative twist. OBannons genius lay in grounding his bleak horror havoc in ideas that preoccupy the modern psyche social collapse malaise and distrust of authority. ""Prometheus"" was co-written by Damon Lindelof a creator of TVs ""Lost."" Brace yourself Lots of weird stuff occurs without rhyme or reason. In the moody mysterious prologue set on a planet abounding with waterfalls (possibly primordial Earth but who knows?) someone does something that is startling ambiguous and visually arresting. ""Wow"" I thought ""thats amazing. Why is that happening?"" It was a thought that became distressingly familiar over the next 119 minutes. ""Prometheus"" springs from the cautionary fable of fire stolen from the gods and Mary Shelleys ""Frankenstein or the Modern Prometheus"" which revisited the whole man/God/creation situation (and the perils thereof). The story proper begins with archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) whose discoveries suggest that humanity is not alone in the universe. 20th Century Fox Associated Press Michael Fassbender in a scene from ""Prometheus."" This intrigues the worlds richest and apparently oldest man Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce under a thick impasto of wrinkle makeup). As he grapples with mortality he dispatches the cave researchers on a trillion-dollar space expedition seeking alien beings who may have kick-started humankinds evolution. Once they reach their destination things do not go as planned and the crew is swept into an epic battle for mankinds salvation. The fact that the devout infertile Elizabeth and rationalist Charlie are lovers plays a significant part in this story. Like its ""Alien"" kin ""Prometheus"" mines icky anxiety from human and E.T. reproduction. No effort has been spared in imagining the luxury-liner space vessel and the barren moon it visits. The films physical environments have a tangible realism and an unsettling aura too. But its populated with characters we scarcely get to know. The ships soft-spoken robot (Michael Fassbender) who behaves like a blandly sinister Jeeves is more engaging than his human cohorts. Other than Charlize Therons condescending Weyland Corp. overseer and Idris Elbas affable captain the crew members are indistinct characters who might as well be named Victims 1 through 10. ""Alien"" built to a big emotional payoff because we were surprised by Sigourney Weaver evolving from a peripheral character into the last heroic human standing. No one in this film creates such a compelling connection to the audience. The squad gets gobbled up like Beer Nuts and without much more impact. ""Aliens"" blue-collar crew did their ill-equipped best to fight an ultimate killer. Here the astronauts die because they are idiots. Would you mourn for a chump who reaches out welcomingly to a space cobra as if it were a docile attraction at a petting zoo? Would you grieve patsies who get lost in corridors they have just painstakingly computer-mapped or a nimrod who runs from a giant wheel of death along the path of its rotation rather than veering perpendicular to safety? Would you accept one crew member infecting another with alien bio-slime just to see what happens? ""Prometheus"" saddles a billion-dollar franchise with a dollar-store script. Luckily in space no one can hear you groan.

Very much a prequel to Scotts 33-year-old sci-fi scare-em-up Alien the new film likewise finds a crew aboard a Weyland Corp. ship making its way to a far-off mysterious orb. A battle of phallic and yonic symbolism and a lot of icky slime await. Set in the late 21st century Prometheus actually begins on some dramatic primordial cliff face where a giant guy covered in talcum powder drinks something strange out of a cup drops it in a waterfall and causes everything in sight - himself included - to implode. Cut to a pair of new millennium archaeologists Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) exploring a cave and landing their flashlights on an elaborate pictogram. They are thrilled by their discovery - this is the handiwork of ancient artists to be sure and the circle of planets depicted in the painting matches images created by other ancient civilizations around the world. Profound implications these. Profound enough for a trillion-dollar space expedition to be launched. The good ship Prometheus with a crew of 17 is off. While Shaw and Holloway dreamy-eyed scientists (and lovers too) are ostensibly the leaders of the team tell that to Charlize Theron. In her tailored jumpsuits sporting a look of icy calculation the actress who is so good (and bad) as the Queen in Snow White and the Huntsmen here plays Vickers the Weyland rep aboard the exploratory vessel. Her agenda is very different from Shaws and Holloways. And then there is David (Michael Fassbender) whom we first see bicycling around the eerily quiet Prometheus bouncing a basketball and watching Lawrence of Arabia on a huge screen. (And repeating Peter OTooles line ""The trick William Potter is not minding that it hurts."") David is to the spaceship Prometheus what Hal was to 2001s Discovery One the artificial intelligence in charge. Only David is a robot in human form looking with his blond coif and chiseled features not unlike OTooles T.E. Lawrence. As the crew lies in hypersleep for the three-year voyage David has free run and free rein of the place. When they awake - achy and nauseated - Davids stint as the android in command is over. Or is it? Prometheus has some amazing set pieces (a cavernous pyramid with its vast span of cylindrical vases and sphinxlike forms) amazing gizmos amazing visual effects. Filmmaking technology has advanced light-years since the 1970s when Scott and his Alien gang were busy with miniatures and matte paintings and Prometheus is dreamily and then nightmarishly vivid dazzling. But narratively its a mess. Theres a through-line Darwinism vs. creationism thing going on that ping-pongs big religious and philosophical ideas but whiffs the return. Motivations remain unclear. Relationships are defined by wispy strands of plot not human (or robotic) interaction. Idris Elba who plays Prometheus captain Janek fools around with an American accent and a button accordion that he claims once belonged to Stephen Stills (talk about throwaway pop-cult references). The essential and the tangential are accorded equal weight or no weight at all. It is Rapace the Swedish actress who gained worldwide recognition as Lisbeth Salander in the original adaptation of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo who ends up the true heroine of Prometheus. What the diminutive Dr. Shaw endures - wrestling with many-tentacled creatures and performing a bit of rather major surgery on herself (staple gun stat) - is more than most girls can handle. And yet handle it she does. She may even be ready for a Prometheus sequel. Shes already packed her duffel bag with the stuff that matters. Contact Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

On a distant moon in the gigantic cavern of an ancient vanished race the android David (Michael Fassbender) sits at a kind of organ console and plays notes that summon images of planets aligning -- a stately celestial dance to the music of the spheres. In its eerie emotive power the scene goes beyond the contact of humans with extraterrestrials through a musical phrase in Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Here David might be God in the ecstatic act of creating the universe. Or he could be Ridley Scott conducting his team of actors and technicians in the bold atonal symphony that was the 1979 Alien. Alien proved to be the years fourth biggest hit spawning three sequels directed by some very gifted young men -- James Cameron for Aliens in 1976 David Fincher for Alien3 in 1992 and Jean-Pierre Jeunet for Alien Resurrection in 1997 -- while Scott directed one more science-fiction film the superb Blade Runner but nothing else in the genre for 30 years. ""Ridley did the first one and the franchise kind of went off in another direction"" screenwriter Damon Lindelof told Ethan Sacks of the New York Daily News. ""He was the father of this thing and it ran away from home at a young age and its the idea of him coming back and saying Im your father. Lets get to know each other and hang out together. "" (MORE Richard Corliss on Ridley Scotts Blade Runner) Thirty-three years later after those three sequels and a couple of cynical hybrids that grafted the Alien monster to the Predator drone Scott has returned to his space-horror child. Prometheus which opened throughout Europe last week and will come to North American theaters on Friday is a clear prequel to Alien -- the DNA matches precisely-- and for many veteran movie watchers the most eagerly anticipated event of this summer in Hollywood. Yet when 20th Century Fox released Alien on May 25 1979 two years to the day after Star Wars the film was met with reviews that ranged from mixed to vexed. Michael Sragow of the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner dismissed it as ""an overblown B-movie."" In the New York Times Vincent Canby wrote that ""the roles might have been written by a computer."" New York magazines David Denby was driven to near cosmic despair calling Alien ""a film that uses the emotional resources of movies with such utter cynicism that one feels sickened by the medium itself."" Opined TIMEs Frank Rich ""It is depressing to watch an expensive crafty movie that never soars beyond its cold desire to score the big bucks ... Scott knows how to push the buttons that make the audience squirm but he achieves nothing that could not be accomplished equally well by sending electric shocks through a theaters seats."" (MORE Frank Richs Alien Review -- Cinema Sell Job) It might have been that threat of cinematic shock therapy -- and the famous ad line warning ""In space no one can hear you scream"" -- that made me approach Alien later that summer with a kind of sacred dread. As a viewer with a sluggish nervous system Ive always been susceptible to scare scenes in films my spine freezes in fear before my brain can send the message that you idiot its only a movie. When I finally did see Alien I watched it with one hand blocking part of the screen as my braver companion Mary Corliss whispered descriptions of the uggy stuff Id just missed. A few months later I dared to watch the whole movie on a hotel TV -- with the sound turned down. Jerry Goldsmiths score would not frighten me. After that I was able to look at Alien with a certain analytic detachment and appreciate its conception of the claustrophobic world of the spaceship Nostromo the prickly camaraderie of the Nostromos weary crew the masterly orchestration of suspense as the monster picks off its victims in Ten Little Indians fashion and of course H.R. Gigers majestic design of the title xenomorph in its several gestations. All that plus the rare elevation of a woman -- Sigourney Weavers Ripley -- to action-film hero status. Last year for TIME.coms All-TIME Top 25 Horror Movies Alien was ranked No. 2 right behind Psycho. (LIST All-TIME Top 25 Horror Movies) Impatient readers will observe that I have craftily deferred revealing any salient shocks from Prometheus. But thats exactly what Scott does for the first third of his new movie. In the early scenes he teases large questions of theology and cosmology suggesting that this will be the ultimate prequel a quest for the very origins of life on Earth. Then the director settles down to the business of trying to scare you. And when he does even viewers with agitated nervous systems will be oddly soothed by how faithfully Prometheus replicates the strategies and shocks of Alien. The movie is less a prequel than a pre-make Alien minus one. Some younger viewers for whom a film series than began in the Carter Administration and ended before The Sopranos aired is a musty old artifact may well say ""Alien Schmalien. Is it a good movie?"" And wed reply to the uninitiated that if you like your R-rated sci-fi-horror pictures in two parts -- first half chatty second half bloody -- youll find half an exciting evening at Prometheus. Its just not what your parents steeped in Alien lore and gore were hoping for. (MORE Todays Movie Trailer Prometheus Makes Us Want to Buy a Michael Fassbender) The film opens in misty pre-history when Earth is visited by a representative of a superior race. Looking like one of those powder-caked muscle men who perform the hand-to-hand ballet in a Cirque du Soleil show he leaves the seeds of Earths evolution in a tin of caviar-like squirmy thingies. Then he gazes at the space vessel above him and literally cracks up. With visual elements reminiscent of Scotts 1984 Apple commercial and the arterial river rafting of the 1966 Fantastic Voyage this scene primes the viewer for lofty consideration of mans place in a mutable universe -- 2012 A Space Ontology. Skeptics will note that Prometheus seems inspired by another work from 1968 the same year as Stanley Kubricks visionary film Erich von Danikens Chariots of the Gods? the pseudoscientific book proposing that extraterrestrial astronauts came to Earth and passed their advanced technology along to early human civilizations. In the main section of Prometheus set in 2089 -- students of Alien minutiae will identify this as possibly the year of Ripleys birth -- Ripleys predecessor and partial soul mate is Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) an archaeologist who has discovered plangent cave paintings at least 35000 years old hinting at a map to the stars. With this evidence she and her scientist beau Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) convince corporate potentate Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) to fund an expedition to a remote moon indicated by the cave art. Janek (Idris Elba) captains the vessel Prometheus but the real boss is Weyland executive Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron). She seems in it just for the money reminding the crew ""My company spent a trillion dollars to get here."" (Mind you in 2089 dollars a trillion dollars would buy you a double chocolate Frappuccino at Starbucks.) (LIST The 10 Greatest Movies of the Millennium [Thus Far]) The original Alien crew members lived in the present tense. Did Ripley have a husband and child back on Earth? We dont know and arent meant to guess. This was a dictum of Walter Hill one of Aliens rewriters and producers who is quoted in David Thomsons definitive book on the series The Alien Quartet as saying about movie characters ""I dont care where people come from. I dont care where theyre going. I do care what they are doing. I care very much."" Everything happened in the present to a bunch of working stiffs on a perilous mission -- as it had in Aliens obvious antecedent the 1951 The Thing from Another World with a vengeful space creature attacking soldiers and scientists at an isolated outpost. Scott though cared very much where someone in Alien had come from the large dead extraterrestrial known to the moviemakers as the ""space jockey"" or ""big dental patient."" His electronic signals had led the Nostromo to that dangerous planet; his chest cavity had been burst open (by the ""face hugger"" that would cause mayhem later). Returning to science fiction 30 years after Blade Runner Scott uses Prometheus to explore the fate of the space jockeys people -- the race that brought life to Earth and whose own planet is their burial chamber. (LIST All-TIME 100 Movies) The Prometheus crew like that of the Nostromo represents a rough amalgam of officers and grunts -- disposable characters who can serve as eventual snack food for any monsters in the vicinity. Holloway in particular wears a superior smirk that all but guarantees an early violent demise. Other characters behave so gratingly that a viewer will welcome their deaths just to be rid of them. In horror movies attitude is destiny. In the script by Lindelof and Jon Spaihts the two women onboard are laden with backstory. Both have father issues especially Shaw; her fathers hallowed memory gnaws at her the way Jodie Fosters dead astronomer father did in the 1997 Contact another science-fiction drama about a womans yearning to communicate with advanced alien civilizations. Shaws father love extends to God the Father; her fervent Christianity (""Its what I choose to believe"") echoes the crucial place of religion in the plot of Alien3. She also believes she is incapable of bearing offspring. Well see about that. Rapace an actress of feral intensity as Lisbeth Salander in the Swedish Girl with the Dragon Tattoo movie and its sequels somehow goes off the rails here. Granted Shaw is a veritable internal combustion engine of emotions but Rapace conveys these tensions with little more than a strained mopiness. Theron does fine in a rote role Pearce is trapped in implausible old-man makeup and Elba (the consigliere Stringer Bellon The Wire) is just along for the ride. The crew bickers and backtracks for most of the first hour until the viewer half-wonders if the ad line for Prometheus should be ""In space no one can see you yawn."" (MORE The Girl Who Played with Fire Moony over Noomi) Among the actors only Fassbender finds a character worth inhabiting and enriching. A blond cyborg David is worlds dishier than Ian Holms Ash in the original and carries himself with the stiff elegance of Star Wars C-3PO but he is neither cranky nor prone to malfunction. David has been fashioned to look and speak in the manner of Peter OToole in Lawrence of Arabia. Like Pixars WALLE fixated on a Beta tape of Hello Dolly David replays his favorite film with special attention to the scene where Lawrence douses a match with his fingers. Does it hurt? someone asks. Of course it hurts. ""The trick William Potter is not minding that it hurts."" Can a robot feel pain or just ensure that humans feel it? The real engine of the Prometheus plot David discovers the sticky stuff that will morph into the crews mortal threat. (When he holds the space goo between his fingers in a closeup it could be a silhouette shot of the first films evil alien.) It is he who effects communication with the dead space jockey -- the message is ""Try harder"" -- and who thinks the goo might be an amusing additive to a crew members coffee. Poignantly aware of his android status he is also clued in to the super-race that came to Earth. Discussing origins with David Holloway tells him ""We made you because we could."" The robots reply ""Maybe thats why they made you."" (MORE Michael Fassbender Profile The Wild Irish Boy) The people who made the cavern in Prometheus made it beautiful a huge dark expanse with an enormous statue of a human head in the center whose walls are adorned with mysterious reliefs. (Is that an evolved ""alien"" carved on the far wall? Or the Brigitte Helm robot from Fritz Langs 1927 speculative epic Metropolis? Anyway its something imposing cool and deadly.) The grandeur and portent of the cavern are to die for as several of the crew members soon find out. And you have skimmed this far through this essay to find out what the big gross-out scenes are. Im bound by reviewers ethics not to err on the side of the explicit but I will say that the most memorable shock tactics in the original film are recycled with minor variations in Prometheus. The gut-buster scene in Alien becomes a Caesarean section here; the face-hugger attack in the egg chamber gets a nice elaboration involving a black python-like organism with similar powers of bodily penetration. You liked the talking severed android heads in Alien and Aliens? Then third times the charm. (MORE TIMEs 1986 Cover Story on Aliens Help Theyre Back) But not the second time for Scott on his Alien reupping. After all these years the director or his team should have dreamed up a few novel scenes. Perhaps theyre saving their real ingenuity for a sequel to the prequel. Lindelof says there could be one or more films that would ""run parallel to and independent of Alien."" Independent of? Really? The familiar image in the movies last shot indicates that the Prometheus series should there be one will close the narrative circle on Alien as Revenge of the Sith did on Star Wars. If thats the case my advice to Scott and Lindelof is Try harder -- to bring the characters as well as the creatures alive; to extend the grandeur of that music-of-the-sphere scene to an entire movie; to devise new horror-film money shots; and to scare the crap out of me. Because Im still susceptible to movie fright and I saw Prometheus without my trusty guide-wife next to me to describe the creepy stuff yet watched every second of the movie. And not once did I jump out of my skin.

"Movie review Its no Alien but Prometheus still delivers thrills - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesReview Its no Alien but Prometheus still delivers thrillsRidley Scotts Prometheus offers up more creeps than scares with Michael Fassbender turning in the most engrossing performance as the resident android.June 07 2012|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Audra McDonald and Norm Lewis in ""The Gershwins Porgy and Bess""... (Michael J. Lutch / Associated...)Part philosophical treatise part pulp fiction part pure horror show Ridley Scotts ""Prometheus"" ends up with less to say than it thinks it does. Though more involving than much of this years summer blockbuster competition by the standards set by its wizardly director its something of a disappointment. Scotts ""Alien""(1979) and ""Blade Runner""(1982) are two of the preeminent science fiction films and so it was inevitable that ""Prometheus"" would be compared to them. But its especially the case because ""Prometheus"" a starring Noomi Rapace Michael Fassbender and Charlize Theron a shares as Scott himself has said some DNA strands with ""Alien."" Anyone who is unfamiliar with ""Alien"" need not worry a ""Prometheus"" stands on its own. But those with vivid memories of what happened to Ellen Ripley aboard the Nostromo 33 years ago will find several points of reference in common with this latest iteration. Aside from Scotts expert first-time use of 3-D the main differences between ""Prometheus"" and those earlier films are that the new venture is more creepy than it is scary and its considerably more self-conscious about the ideas that lie beneath the action. Although the director remains a master creator of alternate worlds ""Prometheus"" unlike its predecessors does not wear its themes lightly. It pushes too hard for significance which is dicey in and of itself for genre material and contrasts badly with the standard nature of some of the storys plotting. As written by Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof (co-creator of TVs ""Lost"") ""Prometheus"" begins after an arresting but baffling prologue at a dig on Scotlands Isle of Skye in the year 2089. Elizabeth Shaw (Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) a pair of romantically involved archaeologists have made a startling discovery a 35000-year-old pictogram that shows humans worshiping an enormous figure who points to the stars. This same image has also been discovered in a number of far-flung sites all over the world leading Shaw and Holloway to conclude (as an unacknowledged Erich von Daniken claimed in his 1968 book ""Chariots of the Gods"") that beings from outer space had a big hand in creating life on Earth. Messianically determined to find these aliens and answer once and for all big questions like ""Where do we come from? What is our purpose?"" the pair persuades the worlds richest human Peter Weyland of Weyland Industries (Guy Pearce under a ton of makeup) to spend a trillion dollars give or take to fund a trip to outer space with the purpose of tracking those ""engineers"" down. ""Prometheus"" proper begins on a spaceship ominously named after the character in Greek mythology who suffered greatly for challenging the gods. Though Janek (an excellent Idris Elba) is the nominal captain the ship is really run by Meredith Vickers (Theron) a Weyland Industries bigwig who is not shy about saying things like ""my job is to make sure you do yours."" Theron who has clearly found her comfort zone with ice-cold roles is strong here but from the acting point of view ""Prometheus"" belongs to the protean Fassbender who excels as David the spaceships resident android. Considered by Peter Weyland to be the closest thing to a son he has albeit with the drawback of not having a soul David (who watches""Lawrence of Arabia""for tips on being human) is smarter and more capable than anyone on the ship and very much knows it. Fassbender gets Davids almost-but-not-quite human character exactly right and is especially good at conveying the can-he-be-trusted aspect that always comes with android territory. More hit and miss is Rapace (of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"") who never quite connects with the tree-hugger aspects of Shaws character but really comes into her own once things start to go south in a major way. For it will not come as a surprise to anyone that everything is not exactly sweetness and light on the planet where the Prometheans land in search of those creative aliens. All kinds of awful increasingly grotesque and horrific stuff starts to happen and having someone with Shaws indomitability around turns out to be a major plus for mankind. (In an odd convergence both ""Prometheus"" and the benighted""Battleship""share a press material reference to scientistStephen Hawkingswarning that intelligent life from other planets ""might develop into something we wouldnt want to meet."" True story.) Making up for the expected nature of some of the films plot twists is Arthur Maxs spooky H.R. Giger-influenced production design Dariusz Wolskis fluid cinematography as well as Scotts moment-to-moment storytelling skill. Though the thrills here are less visceral than ""Alien"" and the world imagined less mind-altering than ""Blade Runner"" those gifts continue to impress in any galaxy you care to mention.

Comments (2) Prometheus Video Rated R  123 minutes  2012 The plot of this Alien prequel was a carefully guarded secret--so carefully guarded in fact that not even the movie reveals it. Something about archaeological star maps a senescent millionaire (Guy Pearce) bankrolling an expedition to a distant moon green goo that makes people really sick and the usual antagonistic crew of interstellar explorers (Charlize Theron Idris Elba Noomi Rapace Michael Fassbender). You may feel fussy asking for a coherent narrative though because director Ridley Scott delivers so many of the shocking set pieces that are the real hallmark of the series pearly snakes diving down peoples throats vicious cephalopods bursting out of chest cavities even a frantic abortion sequence in which Rapace impregnated with some awful critter undergoes a mechanized C-section inside an automated surgical pod. Production designer Arthur Max deserves a large share of credit too for his blackened lunar catacombs littered with mollusk-like corpses. By J.R.

"Prometheus movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Prometheus Ridley Scott returns to space and finds something familiar  Prometheus Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Nearly all the bits and pieces in director Ridley Scotts""Prometheus"" come from other movies -- either one of Scotts or someone elses. More and more though I appreciate Scotts fundamental squareness as a filmmaker. ""Prometheus"" may be the""Gladiator"" directors first picture shot digitally and in 3-D but theres an old-school assurance in the pacing and the design.""Elegant"" and ""stately"" are two adjectives that wont mean a thing to the potential teen audience for ""Prometheus"" but theyre the most apt. Phrases such as ""not especially well-written"" and ""sort of a prequel to Alien but not really ... "" also apply here. This is Scotts first straight-up science fiction outing since ""Blade Runner"" in 1982 three years after he became a Hollywood force with the success of ""Alien."" The new film does not in fact require any firsthand knowledge of the thing that burst out of John Hurts chest 33 years ago.Yet there is no doubt that ""Prometheus"" set about a hundred years from now and starring Noomi Rapace (""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"") as an archaeologist leading a space mission to capital-T Trouble is an ""Alien""-derived life form. Dan OBannon the writer of ""Alien"" said it loud and proud ""I didnt steal Alien from anybody"" he told one interviewer. ""I stole it from everybody"" ""Prometheus"" has that same magpie quality on a bigger more sprawling scale.The films most vivid single element -- Michael Fassbenders turn as a humanlike android with the fishy obsequiousness of HAL in ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" -- cashes in on our collective memories of Kubricks troublesome computer with a side order of Jude Laws metallic gigolo in the Kubrick/Steven Spielberg amalgam ""A.I."" The robot with the classy diction and ambiguous intentions is nothing new (In fact Ian Holm played one in ""Alien."") And yet it seems so here partly because Fassbenders variation on a familiar archetype is so meticulous and witty and partly because our relationships with attractive devices of all kinds have become the stuff of daily waking nightmares. Or maybe thats just my inner Amish guy talking.The idea in ""Prometheus"" is that Earth long ago on the Isle of Skye received a visit from an alien race and our DNA got shmershed together with theirs. A powerful corporation run by Guy Pearce in hundreds of pounds of ancient-industrialist makeup finances the mission to find these beings.Rapace embodies true questing belief and she yearns for the answers to lifes riddles. Charlize Theron as the unblinking tougher-than-Sigourney Weaver company flunky overseeing the mission plays her opposite number. Idris Elba portrays the ships captain. ""Prometheus"" sends one rather generic set of characters poking around in the space-caves as part of their field work which leads to encounters with invasive snakelike monsters while the others hang back and wait for Trouble to come to them. ""Invasive"" is the key descriptor here. In a shameless but undeniably effective remix of the most notorious scene from the 79 picture Rapaces character resolves her own private alien invasion in such a way as to inspire both awe and ugh at what might be medically possible insurance issues aside a few decades from now. Its a nerve-racking set piece. But the shock and peals of nervous laughter that bit provoked so many summers ago cannot be replicated only self-imitated.The new movies rooting interests are muted. Scott tells a tale of hubris and human naivete. The best of ""Prometheus"" is nonverbal and purely atmospheric Fassbenders""Lawrence of Arabia""-loving character bouncing a basketball as he patrols the spaceship while his human cohorts finish up their two-year nap. Or the sight of the nifty red probes shaped like tennis balls scooting through the air on Planet X or wherever it is the ""Prometheus"" gang finds themselves. God (or Alien) knows this movie is derivative.

"Prometheus | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; prometheus ) Prometheus (United States 2012) June 07 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli In 1979 science fiction was thriving but the movie community becoming gorged on lightweight space opera fare like Star Wars was unprepared for what Ridley Scott delivered with Alien which was as much horror as it was sci-fi. Since the iconic xenomorph made its debut it has been overused to the point where theres little left to excite a serious filmmaker. James Camerons Aliens was the only sequel to build effectively upon the foundation laid by Scott. The lazy and disappointing Alien 3 and the lackluster Alien Resurrection degraded the brand - a brand that was utterly destroyed by the Alien vs. Predator abominations. So when Scott expressed a desire to return to the Alien universe it came as no surprise that he wanted to avoid doing another Alien movie although the temptation not to fully sever the umbilical cord was too great. Prometheus is a prequel that works as a stand-alone but offers added benefits to those familiar with the Alien series. Is it a worthy addition to a franchise that has been unable to boast a genuinely satisfying entry in more than 25 years? That depends on what youre expecting. Prometheus is not without problems but for the most part they are problems that result from overreaching rather than playing it safe. In a strange way I was reminded of Tree of Life. Scott takes chances and some of his choices dont work but the movie is never uninteresting. Prometheus is more cerebral than I expected and thats a good thing. It weighs more heavily on familiar science fiction conceits than action adventure thriller or horror elements. In fact some of the ""monster moments"" seem almost to have been shoehorned to elevate the energy level and keep things from becoming too talky. Prometheus has a little too much going on. Its a story of big ideas and as is often the case with movies designed to be about something the human characters are marginalized. Even the best developed of them is a little two-dimensional and many of the secondary characters are defined only by recognizable traits. Its difficult to argue that any of the individuals in Prometheus has what could be considered a satisfying character arc. One of the principals (think tall blond) in particular is cheated. The film also deals with the genesis of the alien although that in some ways is a tangential element. Although Prometheus has a lot of hooks that lead to Alien a direct sequel to this movie would likely go in another direction. The conclusion of Prometheus gets things to where they need to be at the start of the 1979 movie. If theres no Prometheus 2 it wont leave a gap in the Alien chronology. The majority of the movie takes place during the final weeks of the year 2093. The 17-man crew of the science vessel Prometheus is awakened from hypersleep when the ship approaches their destination - a desolate planet orbiting a distant sun-like star that may be the home of space visitors who intervened in early human history. The creations have come in search of their gods to ask one of the most basic questions of existence Why? Although this is the stated goal of the mission several individuals have their own agendas. The lead scientists are Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) although their role as ""leaders"" is somewhat limited. Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) is in charge and she makes it clear that if aliens are found contact is not to be initiated. Prometheus captain Janek (Idris Elba) is content to remain on the bridge of his ship and watch on monitors as the expedition departs. There is also an android on board (a precursor to Aliens Ash and Aliens Bishop) David (Michael Fassbender) whose motivations are inscrutable. The initial expedition discovers a series of massive underground caverns and chambers as well as the corpse of one giant humanoid but nothing is alive. That quickly changes however and the life forms that come into being are not friendly. If theres an obvious element missing from Prometheus its a strong identification with the humans who are underdeveloped and underwritten. Most of whats interesting about the story has little to do with the protagonists. Prometheus is about solving mysteries - not only piecing together the specific series of events that lead to the ""birth"" of a lethal species but also answering questions about the motivations of the ""Engineers"" who came to (what would eventually become known as) LV-426 and what their long range plans are. The conclusion is open-ended but doesnt feel incomplete. Watching Prometheus in 3-D I was strongly reminded of how different a native 3-D production is from a converted one. Scott is one of only a handful of filmmakers to film a major motion picture in 3-D and the visual quality is striking. Prometheus 3-D creates a sense of depth and detail that even the best 3-D conversion cannot come close to replicating. Whats more because Scott compensates for the dimness of the glasses the movie never descends into a murky mess. Its a crisp clear experience entirely unlike about 90% of whats out there being touted as 3-D. Prometheus like Avatar and Hugo shows that when used as a tool and not a money-grubbing gimmick there is a place for 3-D in todays movies. Unfortunately it takes directors like Cameron Scorsese and now Scott to find the ""sweet spot."" Although I have no doubt that Prometheus will work in 2-D the 3-D is worth the extra money; it enhances rather than degrades the experience. Prometheus is not an actors movie and there are few standout moments. Noomi Rapace looking absolutely nothing like The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and appearing a little lost has the most screen time and undergoes an experience even more harrowing than the one forced upon Sigourney Weaver in Alien. Rapaces Elizabeth is the most rounded character - we learn details of her childhood understand what motivates her and respect her strength and survival instinct. Aside from her the most intriguing individual may be the android David who is played with a mixture of curiosity detachment and arrogance by Fassbender whose appearance is intentionally like that of Peter OToole in Lawrence of Arabia. Guy Pearce has a small but important role as Peter Weyland the funder of the Prometheus expedition although the actor is unrecognizable under old age makeup. Its easy to forecast Prometheus biggest obstacle getting audiences to buy into adult science fiction with a movie that is being touted as an Alien prequel. On the sci-fi spectrum Prometheus is a lot closer to 2001 than it is to Alien vs. Predator. Viewers should understand what theyre getting; it has less to do with action and shock killings (although there are a few of those) than with an exploration of space as a means of learning about what it means to be human. This is intentionally a very different movie from Alien; Scott consciously did not repeat himself except perhaps in small doses. One could argue that Prometheus has more in common with Scotts other iconic science fiction endeavor Blade Runner than with Alien. Whatever its pedigree however one thing is clear Prometheus is the antithesis of the ""big dumb summer movie."" Its visuals and special effects can stand toe-to-toe with any of the seasons spectacles but are audiences ready for something with an intelligent thought-provoking screenplay where the action is secondary? Prometheus is flawed but stupidity cannot be numbered among its missteps.

Although it doesnt fulfill its promise to solve the riddles of life the universe and everything it does answer the call for a summer blockbuster with bite.The year is 2093 and 17 scruffily individualized scientists are shuttling through deep space in the titular vessel. Their nominal leaders are archeologists Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace sans dragon tattoo) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green a clone of Tom Hardy) who have deduced from cave paintings that the ""engineers"" of the human species are inviting us to the Garden of Eden. But the real force behind the mission is elderly gazillionaire Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce seen in holograms and unconvincing old-age makeup) whose on-board surrogates are narcissistic cyborg David (Michael Fassbender openly imitating Peter OToole from ""Lawrence of Arabia"") and Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron as cooly efficient as an East German figure skater).On a distant moon the expedition discovers a catacomb containing the bodies of our giant Aryan ancestors -- and the fast-growing slithering critters that may have exterminated them. Ongoing conflict is coded into both species DNA and the human visitors become host organisms for a feeding frenzy.The body-horror imagery that was so shocking in the first ""Alien"" gets trumped here by a scene in which Shaw discovers shes infected with a fetal invader and doesnt have health coverage. Her do-it-yourself Caesarean is sure to earn Rapace a place on the Hollywood A-list. And poker-faced Fassbender is an even better robot than Ian Holm in the original. But the real stars here are Scotts behind-the-curtain crew who fill every frame with tech-savvy details and take the sets to another dimension with immersive 3-D imagery.Aping Stanley Kubricks ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" Scott and his screenwriters have designed this towering puzzle to provoke debate with liberal allusions to gender race and religion. While ""Prometheus"" teases us with theses about the origin of life before a last-scene cheat that sets up a sequel the immediate movie is a groovy trip.

"Great Scott Prometheus is on fire |       NJ.com comments Great Scott Prometheus is on fire Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on June 07 2012 at 730 AM View/Post Comments Kerry BrownCharlize Theron and Idris Elba in ""Prometheus."" The question isnt why Ridley Scott makes such great science-fiction movies -- ""Blade Runner"" ""Alien"" and now the simultaneously primal and teasingly philosophical ""Prometheus."" The only question is why doesnt he make more of them? His interest in working in a wide variety of genres -- sword-and-sandal epics feminist dramas gangster movies war films -- is certainly understandable. Even laudable. But whatever the story what Scott seems truly repeatedly drawn to is a core theme in the very best speculative fiction -- frail figures in a cosmic landscape foolishly fighting each other (and themselves) against an implacable backdrop. It could be the mammoth marble Coliseum where the ""Gladiator"" took his stand the Western deserts ""Thelma and Louise"" traversed or the worlds Columbus crossed in ""1492 Conquest of Paradise."" But theyre movies about lives being lost or won and barely noticed while in the background the pitiless horizon stretches endlessly. (Its no surprise that the film ""Prometheus"" quotes from most often is David Leans hymn to empty spaces ""Lawrence of Arabia."") The dark devilish creepily compelling ""Prometheus"" may not be Scotts own ""Lawrence of Arabia."" Its script doesnt have that heft (and as a predominantly visual artist Scott is always at the mercy of whatever screenplay hes working from). But it is certainly ""Alien"" reborn daring you to look away and guaranteeing you cant. If youre waiting for a smarter sci-fi film to come along this summer -- dont. Both a prequel and a kind of parallel to Scotts original sci-fi monster flick ""Prometheus"" begins (after some initial throat-clearing) on another huge corporate spacecraft hurtling through deep space on an appointment with the unknown. It has a full crew (and a wound-tight company representative) but its mission is clear -- to find the planet which two ""Chariots of the Gods"" scientists insist mans ancient extraterrestrial visitors once called home. Simple right? It is -- until they get there. Adding to her recent run of sardonic survivors Charlize Theron plays the cold corporate honcho; as one of the scientists Noomi Rapace outdoes even that girl with the dragon tattoo in sheer indestructibility (there is one scene that is going to have every woman in the audience -- and most men -- squirming in empathetic agony). And anyone who thought Michael Fassbender seemed superhuman in ""Shame"" -- well youll be happy to see that thats literally what he is here as David the sleekly blond feyly elegant and purely unemotional cyborg who seems to know everything including a few crucial things hes not sharing with just anyone. Fassbenders rebellious robotic David isnt just a nod to ""2001"" (whose sleek interior spaceship design this film also recalls) but of course the ""Alien"" films with their synthetic humans both good (Lance Henriksen) and bad (Ian Holm). As to which one David ultimately turns out to be -- well Im not telling. And neither of course is he. But his presence is just a hint of how neatly the film dovetails with that earlier series while striking out on its own. Yes there are giant spaceships hungry parasites and a very nasty abdominal er extrusion. Theres also a cameo appearance by someone from the original franchise (and no its not Sigourney Weaver). But this new film also is more concerned with faith than any ""Alien"" picture (except the strange underrated ""Alien 3"") as it speculates on mankinds true origins. And it expands on (and moves away from) those classic H.R. Giger creature designs to come up with some really new nasty phallic beasties. True some of the alien designs arent that great and a few of the characters and plot twists feel overfamiliar. Rapaces English accent isnt very sturdy an ancient character is unconvincingly played by a much younger man in makeup and two of the best scenes feel rushed as if Scott didnt trust the audience to stay focused. He neednt worry. Hes always been one of the best image-makers in the business; the question was always did he have a story worthy of his pictures? In ""Prometheus"" he does. And he delivers in a world that has seen studio genre films grow ever less ambitious an impressive epic about the extraordinary vastness of the universe and the immense puniness of us. Ratings note The film contains graphic gore strong language and sexual situations. Prometheus (R) Fox (124 min.) Directed by Ridley Scott. With Charlize Theron Michael Fassbender Noomi Rapace.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet When George Lucas started planning the scenes in Jabba The Hutts palace in Return Of The Jedi he saw an opportunity to improve on his own work. He had never been happy with the low-tech cantina scene in Star Wars with its rubber-suit aliens and fuzzy wolfman. Equipped with a bigger budget and better technology--the rewards of success--he set out to turn Jabbas surroundings into the riot of chaotic colorful creepy alien life hed envisioned the first time around. The results possibly swung too far in the opposite direction--the original cantina scene (before Lucas special-edition digital tinkering) is dark and crude but brief enough to not get in the way of the storytelling. Whereas the sequences in Jabbas palace feel like one of Lucas significant steps toward being more interested in spectacle than story. Its tempting to ascribe some of the same revisionist spirit and love of technology and spectacle to Ridley Scott as he returns to science fiction with Prometheus. While Scott has said the film began as a prequel to his 1979 classic Alien then evolved into a stand-alone film it still feels like a prequel given how hard it works to place all the Alien pieces on the board by the end of the story. (All but one anyway but thats a matter for Spoiler Space.) Even more so though it feels like an Alien remake for a new era of filmmaking. So many of the characters plot beats and design elements are familiar from Alien its actively distracting. But where Alien was grimy and claustrophobic Prometheus is polished expansive and at times breathtakingly beautiful. Its a similar series of plot points on a vastly larger and cleaner visual scale. Still while Scott is as obsessed with visuals as Lucas he clearly wants Prometheus to be an intellectual experience too. Noomi Rapace (star of the original Swedish Girl With The Dragon Tattoo adaptation) and Logan Marshall-Green launch the story as a pair of scientists whove drawn parallels between ancient artworks from around the globe each depicting the same specific star cluster. In that cluster theyve found a moon capable of sustaining life and on that moon they believe theyll find whatever force created life on Earth. A few years after their latest cave-painting discovery theyre the key crewmembers in a trillion-dollar excursion to that moon on a ship unsubtly named Prometheus after the god who gave fire to humanity then paid a terrible price. But as much as the explorers would like the journey to be about their beliefs--Rapaces religious ones Marshall-Greens scientific ones--theyre firmly under the thumb of a severe corporate overseer (Charlize Theron) and a placid android (Michael Fassbender) each with their own agendas. Initially the Prometheus crew doesnt seem much like the Nostromos in Alien apart from Idris Elba whose low-key wryly funny working-man take on captaining a spaceship somewhat echoes Tom Skerritts in the original. But once the crew is revived from suspended animation it becomes clear that most of them werent briefed on their hush-hush mission which starts to look like yet another of the nakedly profit-driven amoral corporate projects that always enable the horror in Alien franchise stories. (In past Alien franchise installments the hubristic evil came from the Weyland-Yutani Corporation; here its just the Weyland Corporation with Guy Pearce as the doddering company founder who bankrolled the expedition.) And as the mission begins to go awry various major and minor characters step up to take familiar roles in Aliens cast-attrition-thriller dynamic while encountering similarly familiar Alien-esque elements. Before that though Prometheus spends an admirably detail-oriented long sleepy period just exploring its own spaces from the ships interior to the various structures that may or may not prove Rapace and Marshall-Greens theory. At times the film hits near-Solaris levels of hushed contemplation as it focuses on serving up a long chilly visual feast. Its clear that Scott and his screenwriters Jon Spaihts and Lost veteran Damon Lindelof (who also co-produced) arent feeling any particular time pressure or a need to move the plot forward. Theron and Fassbender in particular play their cards close to their chests coming across as villains largely due to their coldness and competence rather than any overt gestures. Here as in past Alien stories anything warm soft and organic is a rare comfort in a universe primarily composed of lethal environments and creatures and Theron and Fassbenders hardness marks them as the enemy particularly by comparison with Rapaces physical and emotional vulnerability. They may also come across as villains because Prometheus could use a couple. Alien mined tension from its cramped setting which left its small crew with nowhere to run once things got bad. It kept the scale small and the drama personal giving a face and personality to every victim. Prometheus is far more diffuse with a much larger cast and a focus that wanders between Rapace and Marshall-Green Theron Fassbender a pair of support crew played by Sean Harris and Rafe Spall and various others. In effect for much of the film the mission rather than the people is the star which makes it hard to connect emotionally when things fall apart for some of those people. Fassbender stands out above the rest of the cast partially because he gets more solo screen time and takes more idiosyncratic specific actions but his distanced remove is more designed to provoke curiosity than empathy. Its as though the entire film is designed to keep viewers at arms length. From a technical standpoint though Prometheus is an unqualified success. The design is gorgeous to the point where much of that slow-paced exploration seems designed solely to let the filmmakers show off their accomplishments and their imagination. The ship and its environs are flawlessly executed and a lovely opening sequence on an unidentified alien world is so visually rich it resembles an IMAX nature documentary. Again where Alien was about cramped wet oppressive interiors Prometheus revels in the immaculate glow of CGI holograms and pristine digital displays. The 3-D is crystal-clear well-integrated and vivid without being overt. Its the first Alien franchise movie to imply that the technology of its future can be beautiful and artistic not merely worn and weary. And its the first in the franchise to work at making humans feel tiny to the point of cosmic insignificance rather than merely physically fragile. The human element proves problematic though as the characters decisions are often foolish even comically unbelievable. People in extreme situations often make poor choices but Prometheus characters are routinely fundamentally incompetent in ways difficult to reconcile with their qualifications. Their disregard for common sense and their own safety tends to be distancing and frustrating and lead to the feeling that they deserve what they get much like the one-dimensional characters in slasher films who exist only to exhibit annoying behaviors then get killed for viewers amusement. Also frustrating the films tendency to introduce intriguing ideas then leave them unexplained unexplored or unresolved. Some of that is deliberate and thematic--one of the storys central ideas is that its unwise for mere humans to seek out gods because they might be unimaginable or incomprehensible. But even the humanity-based concepts like the monitor that lets Fassbender watch Rapaces dreams as she sleeps or the conflict between Rapaces beliefs and Marshall-Greens are introduced then dropped in a way thats strikingly at odds with the films otherwise careful thoughtful sense of craft. And by the end when it breaks down into a standard blockbuster action thriller Prometheus sometimes gets damn silly particularly during an impromptu medical procedure that seems intended as a Cronenbergian body-horror moment but heads so far into unlikely territory that its difficult to take seriously. The films early solemnity and its big important ideas about the relationship between humanity and its possible creators are often directly at odds with the dumb things it does to service its ultimate goals. And though Prometheus follows Aliens story beats its a looser and less satisfying story more intellectual than visceral and not fully satisfying on either level. But in part thats because its trying to do so much more. Like Scotts Blade Runner Prometheus questions the relationship between life and its creators and whether the two have any responsibility to each other. It finds parallels between Rapaces questions about humanitys gods Fassbenders curiosity about his own purpose and potential and Therons troubled relationship with her father. It asks large questions about humanitys origins and destiny about life before life on Earth and what happens after death. And while it doesnt offer any answers that feels like a more mature decision than wrapping everything up neatly. Apparently the 30-plus years since Alien has given Scott time to expand his already-impressive range Until that frantic last act Prometheus is essentially an abstract remake of Alien for contemplative grown-ups. If only Lucas had matured this well.For thoughts on and a place to discuss plot details not talked about in this review visit Prometheus Spoiler Space.

Watching ""Prometheus"" is like opening a deluxe gift box from Tiffanys to find a mug from the dollar store. Everything in the films first third primes you for what months of hype have promised a spin-off of the ""Alien"" franchise (sequel? prequel? first cousin once removed?) with the metaphysical stakes raised even higher. The 3-D visuals are epic yet so crisply imagined as to seem hyperreal and the time-scale is equally vast. The movie begins at the dawn of prehistory with an extraterrestrial who looks like he stepped from a Roman frieze sacrificing body soul and DNA to create mankind. Before long were on an interstellar spaceship the Prometheus in the year 2093 full of gleaming machinery and humans desperate to meet their alien makers.Ridley Scott is back at the helm directing his first science-fiction film since the original ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"" at the turn of the 80s. Theres an android steering the ship while the human crew sleeps the journey away; in a nod to ""2001"" hes named Dave and he sounds like HAL. Michael Fassbender plays him as a gentle quick study watching ""Lawrence of Arabia"" to pass the time and dying his hair blonde in imitation of Peter OToole. The crewmembers seem like theyre in good hands and so do we.Yet somewhere along the way you begin to detect the odor of thrice-cooked hash. ""Prometheus"" turns out to be a prequel to the ""Alien"" movies that if you care about such things (and many of us do) fills in a number of blanks The genesis of the Weyland-Yutani Corporation the relevance of the ""space jockey"" from the first film the thoroughly confusing biomorphology of the killer aliens themselves and even why they exist in the first place. The moviemakers take a failed stab at explaining why weexist but presumably theyre saving that for the next film.Essentially though the movies a muscular exquisitely produced remake that sends a crew of earthlings into the dark so that horrible things can happen to them. Weve been here before with lesser technology but more purpose. The central character of ""Prometheus"" -- this movies Ripley -- is Ellie Shaw (Noomi Rapace) an archeologist who with her husband Charlie (Logan Marshall-Green looking like Tom Hardys twin) is the idealist on board. Shes a scientist but also a true believer with a crucifix around her neck that acquires fuzzy symbolic weight as the film progresses.Rapace who played Lisbeth Salander in the Swedish versions of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" films is an elegant engaging presence and you root for her even when shes stripped down to her skivvies (sound familiar?) and battling alien life forms without and within. I think its no coincidence that Ellie shares her noble prow of a nose with the ETs who seeded Earth and who now appear to be having second thoughts. The rest of the crew is a mixed bag of functional characters and lunchmeat. The most enjoyably familiar is Idris Elba as Janek captain of the Prometheus and a nuts-and-bolts sort whos mostly stuck on the ships bridge. The most freshly realized is probably Meredith Vickers a slim soulless representative of the Weyland Corporation. Charlize Theron plays her with every bit of the nuance she left out of ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" and the result is that Vickers is a cool killer of a character five steps ahead of everyone else on the ship yet willing to have a quick shag to prove shes not a robot.All of them set down on a distant planetary moon called LV-223 (not to be confused with LV-426 site of the original ""Alien"") where it is hoped our extraterrestrial creators will greet them with open arms. Most of ""Prometheus"" takes place in the dark caverns beneath the surface with rooms that open on other rooms each revealing more secrets more goo more death. Screenwriters Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof havent filled out the ""Alien"" mythology so much as added additional layers on top of it and you might go a little bonkers trying to keep everything straight. Their ""more"" rarely adds up to ""better.""Around the time that one crew member gets transformed into a rageaholic version of the Elephant Man you start to realize that ""Prometheus"" is throwing scenes at us just to see what sticks. A few feel viciously to the point like the harrowing sequence in which Ellie has to perform emergency surgery on herself or else. Scott is at the top of his game here and the scene is charged with imminent horror yet so tightly edited you cant breathe.What follows feels increasingly scattered although a sequence involving a star-map does take advantage of the films workmanlike 3-D. When the 44-year-old Guy Pearce turns up playing a very old man it feels like a cheat -- why couldnt the producers have just hired a very old man? -- as does the needless twist that follows. By the end the movie feels more bloodless than its heroine and how shes still standing is anyones guess.The first ""Alien"" succeeded because it was demonically streamlined -- it was ""Halloween"" in outer space no less and as it turned out a whole lot more. The second film James Camerons ""Aliens"" remains one of the purest most beautifully crafted action movies of all time with a resonant core of mother love to give it heft. ""Prometheus"" is just big beautiful and empty.There are compensatory pleasures in the richness of the production the immensity of everything we see and the beguiling complexity of the films machinery. (Isnt it ironic that a story taking place 30 years before the first ""Alien"" appears to have superior technology? Discuss.) Yet its telling that the movies most emotionally involving character is an android. Perhaps its all those months watching ""Lawrence of Arabia."" You might be better off doing the same.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. Follow him on Twitter tyburr. (c) Copyright 2012 Globe Newspaper Company.

As movie buffs around the world already know ""Prometheus"" is a long-contemplated prequel -- presumably the first in a series of prequels -- to Scotts 1979 ""Alien"" which blended the horror and sci-fi genres to powerful effect and announced the arrival of a distinctive visual and design aesthetic. Thats been Scotts signature over the past 30-odd years; hes made good films bad films and lots of indifferent ones (""Someone to Watch Over Me"" anyone? ""Matchstick Men""?) but theyve pretty much all had the patented Ridley Scott Look.So the first thing to say about Scott is that he has a mysteriously outsize reputation among his fans who remain devoted to two Zeitgeist-shaping classics he directed many years ago (""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"" of course) and completely unaffected by all the ensuing mediocrity. I mean maybe there are people who watch ""White Squall"" or ""A Good Year"" over and over again. Ive never met any. Furthermore as jaundiced a view as I may have of Scott overall I totally get it. Those two movies helped shape the sensibilities of several generations of moviemakers and movie critics and movie buffs and continue to do so. I vividly remember cutting school with two friends to go see ""Alien"" on opening day in San Francisco and sitting -- quite literally -- on the edge of my seat for the entire first hour. (One of those two guys by the way grew up to be an Oscar-winner.)The next thing to say though is that ""Prometheus"" damn near lives up to the unsustainable hype at least at the level of cinematography production design special effects and pure wow factor. This tale of a deep-space mission late in the 21st century several decades before Sigourney Weavers Ripley and the crew of the Nostromo will discover an abandoned alien spacecraft and its sinister cargo is a sleek shimmering gorgeous and often haunting visual mood piece. No other recent science-fiction film with the sole exception of ""Avatar"" has created such a textured detailed and colorful vision of the human space-traveling future and indeed its reasonable to assume that Scott conceives of ""Prometheus"" as a pessimistic counter-argument to James Camerons eco-parable on various levels. (Lets not forget that it was Cameron who directed ""Aliens"" the massively successful 1986 follow-up that turned Scotts ""Alien"" into a franchise. I suspect theres a lot more hay to be made in exploring their rivalry and to wax pretentious for a sec their artistic dialogue.) With its luminous 3-D graphics deep-focus compositions in grays and iridescent greens and moody blues its cat-suited females and broad-shouldered males ""Prometheus"" is one of very few films in the recent 3-D wave to justify the pumped-up ticket price for those glasses. (The others would be ""Avatar"" ""Hugo"" and maybe ""Despicable Me."")You may have noticed that Ive cranked out several hundred words about ""Prometheus"" without discussing its story or characters. Partly thats because those things are a whole lot less important than say Dariusz Wolskis cinematography Arthur Maxs production design and the art direction of John King Marc Homes Karen Wakefield and their team. Then theres the fact that every nuance and hint and unanswered conundrum raised in the ""Alien"" prehistory concocted by screenwriters Damon Lindelof (a co-creator of ""Lost"") and Jon Spaihts will be endlessly debated and dissected by fans after they see the movie. I dont want to ruin the fun for folks who are already fascinated by the origins of the Space Jockey (that extra-large dead alien spaceman seen early in ""Alien"") and the Xenomorphs (the human-incubated many-jawed monsters) by issuing too many near-spoilers. And I shouldnt spend too much time observing for instance that the whole thing seems to resolve into a cynical hodgepodge of bogus science and even more bogus theology all of it crafted with an eye to fueling further sequels.But lets back up a minute The portentousness and grandiosity of ""Prometheus"" is at once the films great strength and great weakness. Scotts eponymous spacecraft -- a triumph of late-modernist design that might almost be described as the movies main character -- is on its way to a distant star system with its crew packed in suspended-animation glop in search of nothing less than the origins of the human species. If I followed the story correctly some immensely rich and impossibly old dude (played by Guy Pearce apparently wearing Leonardo DiCaprios leftover J. Edgar Hoover face) has agreed to fund this trillion-dollar mission because two archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) have decoded some kind of star map found in prehistoric glyphs and paintings all over the world. You Might Also Like OK Clearly the only reasonable explanation of the mysterious pattern discovered by Shaw and Holloway is that giant geezers from space planted the seeds of humanity on Earth eons ago and then came back bazillions of years later just to convince preliterate civilizations to leave behind invitations for us to come visit when we were all grown up. Then they left again barely an eyelash ago in planetary time maybe just to pick up some smokes or collect the many-tentacled kids from day care. Look I realize that Lindelof and Spaihts got paid a lot of money to develop the ""mythology"" of this universe and theyre probably convinced theyve gotten all its clues and feints and subterfuges worked out. But theres about 17 kinds of nonsense just in the setup for ""Prometheus"" before we even get to the main action. (Who brings archaeologists of all useless professions on a space mission?) Youre way better off just letting the mood and mystery and menace of the movie surround you and not trying to puzzle it out.Rapaces rather mousy Shaw fills the Sigourney Weaver female-protagonist role to some extent and gets to perform an act of especially disgusting auto-surgery that rivals anything else in the ""Alien"" films for pure ick factor. But she never really holds our attention as do the films villains a complementary pair of corporate robots played by Michael Fassbender and Charlize Theron. Fassbenders David who actually is a robot -- and the crews lone sentient member during its long voyage from Earth -- is another performance of hambone precision if thats not a contradiction in terms from the terrific Irish actor. Mind you its a bit weird that even 40 years after HAL in ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" the best way to make an artificial intelligence seem evil is to make him prissy and queeny and presumptively gay. Still its a hilarious performance as if some great manipulative genius out of classic literature -- Gilbert Osmond say from ""Portrait of a Lady"" -- had been juiced up with electronic circuits and shot into space.Theron whos simultaneously killin it in the multiplexes as the evil feminist queen in ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" plays a rather similar role here as the ice-blond private-sector overlord whose true mission obviously has nothing to do with asking philosophical questions of the ""Engineers"" as Shaw and Holloway have dubbed the so-called master race who created us. Honestly now -- I really enjoyed watching ""Prometheus"" almost the whole way through and Im looking forward to seeing it again. Its an enjoyable thrill ride slicked up with a thin veneer of Asking the Big Questions. But do its so-called heroes really have to be such blithering New Age idiots? Lets allow for the narrative possibility that someone or something created human life and/or all life on Earth. Is traveling to the edge of the universe to ask that entity why they did it likely to yield an interesting answer? If Dolly the cloned sheep had been able to talk would she have chased those Scottish scientists into their lab and baaed for explanations? ""Because we could sweetie. Now stop eating my trousers."" The spaceships crew includes a nice turn from Idris Elba as its gruff captain and enjoyable supporting roles for Sean Harris Rafe Spall Benedict Wong and others. It will surprise absolutely no one that when the Prometheus reaches its destination -- a distant planet that apparently is not the same one the Nostromo visits in ""Alien"" -- it does not discover a race of benevolent deities ready to take questions via Google Translate. Instead they find wiggly things and rows of vases oozing sticky black goo and we have a pretty good idea where that stuff leads. Key plot points as per usual depend on the characters dunderheaded decisions and general lack of common sense. Try this out as a rule astronauts of the future When on an unexplored alien planet do not try to make friends with the giant plenary wormsIm generally in tune with the mordant philosophy that seems to be expressed in ""Prometheus"" If you think the human race are assholes wait till you see who made us But its enclosed in this case in a shiny-looking vehicle that becomes more and more like your average horror-chase movie as it goes along channeling not just the entire ""Alien"" series but also ""Blade Runner"" and ""Avatar"" and John Carpenters ""The Thing."" But what ""Prometheus"" resembles most strongly if perhaps accidentally is Terrence Malicks ""The Tree of Life"" as unlikely as that sounds. Both are grand statements of artistic purpose and searches for the beginning of time and the meaning of life. Both are obsessed even hypnotized by the unmatchable spectacle of Stanley Kubricks ""2001"" the greatest of all murky sci-fi allegories. Both will be avidly defended by fans and viciously derided by detractors. Both are mightily impressive spectacles that will maybe kinda blow your mind en route to a hip-deep swamp of pseudo-Christian religiosity. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

This is jumbo-size science fiction with a handsome impermeable titanium gleam -- and a thick coating of creationism lite. In the deep space of the directors deluxe prequel-esque nonprequel to his 1979 classic Alien striking marble-skinned monument-shaped beings of godlike intelligence share screen time with the cool old slimy-skinned vagina-shaped representations of destructive extraterrestrial life known and loved from back in the days of Sigourney Weavers Ellen Ripley. Prometheus elicits Alien memories for viewers who have them but works on its own too as a model of a contemporary (and as is the contempo mode long-winded) sci-fi horror pic. The plot follows the fates of some foolish humans and one devilishly smart robot named David all of whom encounter big trouble in outer space. The visual images impress as polished movie craft -- Scotts visuals always do -- with icy jagged iconography inspired by the otherworldly Icelandic landscape where parts were shot and benefiting from Scotts trademark attention to mood and wet things. The man likes his moisture. But this time hes also a little lost in the misty stars. The title refers to the god of Greek myth who was punished for stealing fire from Zeus and giving it to humans. But oh mortals beware the WTF? awaiting any who try to shed light on the heavy heavy heaviosity of Prometheus mythology. Alien taught us that in space no one can hear you scream. Prometheus teaches us that the gods must be crazy. At least thats one interpretation of the unwieldy origin fable stuck onto this adventure tale like the creature clamped onto John Hurts face in Alien. This we do know A spaceship named Prometheus is heading toward a distant planet following newly discovered prehistoric star maps that seem to suggest X marks the spot where humankind was conceived. One of the scientists who discovered those maps is the brave and capable Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace a pistol especially under the harrowing surgical conditions that mark one of the movies ick-factor high points). Shaw is on board hoping to literally meet her maker She declares herself a woman of faith although faith in what we dont know because heaven forbid the script get theologically specific. Suffice it to say that Shaw treasures her necklace with a cross. And she believes the destination planet is the home of the greater beings -- she calls them directors -- who created Earth and humankind. The other crew members have their own reasons to travel. Shaws boyfriend and fellow scientist (Logan Marshall-Green) has no use for faith but believes in archaeology. The sleek blond ballbuster played by Charlize Theron (in a second performance win of the summer season after Snow White and the Huntsman) represents the corporation funding the venture and has her own not-so-nice intentions. So does corporation magnate Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce). Its difficult to say what the supercilious robot David believes since hes a robot (played by Michael Fassbender as if hes gleefully gliding on ball bearings) but David at least knows hes got a maker. (Like fellow robot WALL?E who studied Hello Dolly David is a student of old movies taking grooming and elocution cues from Peter OToole in Lawrence of Arabia.) Meanwhile the ships captain (Idris Elba) runs the rig with the old-salt harrumphiness of a Navy man escaped from Battleship. For relaxation he pumps an old squeeze box once owned by the rock amp; roll demigod Stephen Stills -- an instance of screenwriters Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof having pop fun. Faithful fans of Lost -- the convoluted TV series co-created by Lindelof -- ought to feel right at home amid the chaos. Did God or gods or higher beings create humans and are they messing with us still? Or maybe it was mice who made men as revealed to fans of The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy? The answer is hazy; try again later. All one needs to know to understand Prometheus and honor Alien is that women can be tough fighters. That the characters with the goofiest accents get killed first. That nothing beats a really primo close-up of a gooey ET creature just before it goes berserk. And that in the great tradition of the best sci-fi films space would be a lot more boring without intrepid human idiots who touch stuff even when told ""Dont touch that"" God bless them.

In theaters June 8 2012. Photo Credit Twentieth Century Fox advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT On a distant planet scientists search for the source of ancient messages sent to Earth. BOTTOM LINE Ridley Scotts first return to ""Alien"" territory since 1979 repeats too many past glories but it looks fantastic and delivers the gory goods with gusto. CAST Noomi Rapace Charlize Theron Michael Fassbender LENGTH 204 Alien"" Ridley Scotts 1979 sci-fi classic didnt just invent a genre -- a slasher film in space -- it set the template for just about every extraterrestrial since. Even today movie aliens look and act like The Alien a grotesque gooey combination of cockroach-underbelly and human genitalia designed for maximum revulsion. The influence of ""Alien"" with its justifiably famous chest-bursting scene is inescapable. Years after ""Alien"" devolved into action fare (""Aliens"" and ""Alien 3"") and knuckle-dragging self-parody (""Alien vs. Predator"") Scott makes his long-awaited return to the material with ""Prometheus."" Does it do justice to the original? Well yes and no. ""Prometheus"" repeats many past glories and its plot is squishy nonsense. But its grand sets and intricate effects are dazzling and in at least one scene Scott almost manages to top himself.

After all the pre-release secrecy ""Prometheus"" turns out to be a prequel in which researchers Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) are led by ancient cave paintings to a distant galaxy. Their crewmates seem naggingly familiar but the actors personalize their roles Michael Fassbender is creepily compelling as the android David; Charlize Theron is all corporate ice as Vickers; and Idris Elba makes for a likable Captain Janek. Rapace lacks the grit of Sigourney Weaver as the iconic Ellen Ripley but compensates with sharp intelligence (and a convincing scream). The films howlingly good centerpiece -- a one-up on that chest-burst -- belongs to her. The script (Damon Lindelof of ABCs ""Lost"" co-wrote) pretends to address high-flown themes of human creation but ""Prometheus"" cant escape the low cliches of the horror genre namely characters who court disaster by poking their fingers into ugly life-forms.

Prometheus Good Director Ridley Scott. Cast Noomi Rapace Logan Marshall-Green Michael Fassbender. Rating R for sci-fi violence including some intense images and brief langauge. Yes the story takes place before Sigourney Weavers Ripley had to figure out a way to defeat the alien whose structural perfection famously was matched only by its hostility. But as director Ridley Scott has told anyone who would listen ""Prometheus"" is very much its own film. Sure there are nods to ""Alien"" and its sequels and eventually it meanders its way to becoming something of an origin story. But youre more likely to enjoy the film if you go in thinking less about ""Alien"" and more about Scott with his emphasis on images tone and atmosphere over -- sometimes at the expense of -- plot and story. Interview Ridley Scott Then youll be fine. Because ""Prometheus"" is a good movie sometimes very good. Its just not a great movie. After a prologue that recalls ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" as much as anything the film begins in 2089 with scientists Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) finding cave drawings that seem to confirm discoveries in other places around the world Beings from space have visited Earth and are inviting us to visit them. At stake is creation itself. Although Shaw and Holloway disagree on precisely where we came from and how they believe these visitors hold the key. And they want to find them. Fast forward to 2093. Shaw Holloway and the crew of the Prometheus (named after the Greek god who gave fire to mortals) are in cyber-sleep headed for another solar system on a mission funded by a private company. The only member awake is David (Michael Fassbender) an android with a love for ""Lawrence of Arabia"" so much so that he colors his hair blond emulating the look and speech of Peter OToole in the starring role. Its a terrific detail. As they near their destination the crew awakens. Most notable are Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) the chief executive of the Weyland Corp. which is funding the mission and Janek (Idris Elba) the ships captain. Vickers is remote cold and dismissive of just about everyone and everything; Janek is an old-school Han Solo-type flyboy. There are other scientists aboard who dont much care whether Shaw and Holloways theory that they have found the source of human creation is correct. They just know a cool science project when they see it. Which probably is accurate behavior in real life but not necessarily the secret to a long life in a science-fiction movie. This is no great spoiler; movies of this sort require sacrifice and ""Prometheus"" is no exception. The tension-building is different from the ""Alien"" movies less claustrophobic (because theyre not always trapped in the ship) but at times just as skin-crawling. Lets just say there are bad things out there. There are callbacks to ""Alien"" of course and other films some of them updated some just fond nods in the general direction. A self-surgery pod manages to be both. And the film looks fantastic; Scott as obsessive fans of ""Blade Runner"" still attest is a master at building alternative universes. His use of 3-D enhances the look of another world and helps in an unobtrusive way to immerse the audience in it. The story is where things get a little screwy. Something so grand as the creation of human life is always going to be a tough sell no matter which side of the religious equation you fall. So there is plenty of talk about belief and doubt and oh wait we better pause here and run for our lives. Rapace isnt Ripley and isnt meant to be but she makes Shaw a tough customer in her own right (in a few scenes absurdly so). Her mix of science and faith is intriguing and Rapace gives a solid performance. Marshall-Green is a dead ringer for the great Tom Hardy which probably helps. Best of the lot is Fassbender who brings a HAL-like sensibility (another ""2001"" nod) to his character mixed with a few shadings of Ash from ""Alien"" (and of course a little of OTooles T.E. Lawrence). Hes funny and complex full of surprises. More questions go unanswered than not which isnt always a bad thing. Here though it seems like a clear set-up for a sequel. Thats disappointing but the movie is good enough that Ill be there for it. Scotts movies are always worth looking at. ""Prometheus"" is certainly that and more besides. Just not as much more as one might have hoped. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter twitter.com/goodyk.

"Prometheus (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Prometheus (R) Director Ridley Scotts return to the science-fiction genre falls short of the standard he set with ""Alien"". Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com6/6/2012 Editor rating 2 In 1979s Alien Ridley Scott turned a spaceship into a house of horrors complete with one of the most terrifying monsters in movie history. In Prometheus he uses a spaceship to go searching for God. See the difference? Scott is certainly not the first filmmaker to set out on this metaphysical voyage -- even William Shatner tried it in Star Trek V -- but few could make the trip look this good. There are things in Prometheus youve simply never seen before (including some of the best 3D effects ever - best primarily because you dont notice them) and there are a handful of set pieces such as a sequence in which a character must conduct a bit of emergency surgery on herself that belong on a clip reel of the directors most exciting bits. But the whole of Prometheus -- which was written by Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof and rips off everything from 2001 A Space Odyssey to Event Horizon -- feels derivative and passe The film is a shiny high-tech relic. The H.R. Giger designs and creations that once seemed primal and nightmarish now come off as set dressing. Once again theres an android who never loses his cool and may or may not be trusted. Instead of clear story lines and narrative momentum the movie trades on college-dorm ruminations on spirituality and faith and existential dilemmas. Instead of an aura of dread or the thrill of discovery you get an ambling pace and lots of navel-gazing reminiscent of the Matrix sequels. Why are we here? What is our purpose? Is there a God? When does this movie get good? According to Prometheus scientists in 2093 are still going to be deriving great meaning from crude drawings on cave walls and using them to justify space missions worth billions of dollars. One day Id like to see a film in which two prankster cavemen smoke some wacky weed and draw some crazy-funny things to amuse themselves only to inadvertently alter the course of mankind in the future. Prometheus initially focuses on a pair of researchers (Noomi Rapace and Logan Marshall-Green) who travel to a remote planet in search of the proverbial ""answers."" Along for the ride are the aforementioned robot (Michael Fassbender) an inexplicably uptight corporate executive (Charlize Theron) and the ships captain (Idris Elba) who you know is cool because he wears a baseball cap sometimes and plays a tiny accordion. There is a whole bunch of other people aboard the eponymous spaceship. We never learn much about them but they might as well have all been named Faceless Victim In Prometheus if youre not played by a famous actor youre probably not going to live to see the end credits. How could a movie as creatively ambitious as this one feel so rote and mundane? As usual Scott pays meticulous care to art design and production. But theres an entire generation of filmmakers who grew up watching Alien and Blade Runner so his work no longer seems quite as visionary. Theres a lot of cool stuff in Prometheus (Im particularly fond of the horseshoe-shaped juggernaut spaceship) but theres nothing especially memorable either. Whats worse Scott surrenders to the temptation of using CGI at critical moments even though a lot of the film was shot on soundstages with practical effects. The use of actual props and constructions only helps make the animated stuff jump out at you more. It was better in Alien when Scott tried hard not to show you the monster because he couldnt. Unlike say the Star Wars prequels which felt like they existed simply because there was serious cash to be made Prometheus does impart a sense of earnest intent. You get the feeling that Scott really was striving for something special here -- the beginning of a new sci-fi franchise with a metaphysical bent. But when you base your movie on a fictional quest by mankind to track down the source of all life confront our makers and question them youre setting yourself up for failure (unless youre Stanley Kubrick; he could do anything). Whats most disheartening about Prometheus is that this veteran director actually believed in this material. The movie is many things but it isnt cynical and the sincerity makes you cringe It leaves you longing for the cheap thrills and jump-scares of Alien. Scott is currently preparing to film The Counselor a drama based on the first original screenplay by Cormac McCarthy. Call me crazy but Im going to go out on a limb and guess that script will be worthy of Scotts considerable talents. Prometheus for all its wonder and spectacle feels like something more tailored to the skills of a Paul W.S. Anderson -- a talented journeyman.

Hyped as a prequel to the directors groundbreaking 1979 science fiction horror effort ""Alien"" the new movie looked like a feeble attempt to recapture the power of that icy genre hybrid after decades of inferior imitations. Even with ""Lost"" creator Damon Lindelof punching up the screenplay the mold sounded too familiar A few astronauts the familiar mix of passionate scientists and trenchant pilots trace the origins of Earths life to a barren world with hideous monsters lurking beneath its surface. Bored yet? Earlier this year audiences were given a reason to feel cynical about the state of Hollywood science fiction. The pricey cosmic spectacle ""John Carter"" was largely regarded as an overambitious and muddled attempt at resurrecting Saturday matinee escapism. Confounding the public and inviting critical derision the movie was an embarrassment to Disney as well as those viewers hoping for excuses to keep celebrating the genre. More than a monumental dud it implied the flagging appeal of the once-vibrant space odyssey. Leave it to Ridley Scott to save the day. Thanks in large part to Lindelof and Jon Spaihts highly calculated screenplay ""Prometheus"" is a brilliantly paced chamber piece a reminder that a few simple props and solid performances matter as much as impressive effects work (of which ""Prometheus"" has plenty as well). Despite occasionally disconcerting pulp dialogue and disposable plot twists to pad a story in no need of them ""Prometheus"" rejuvenates the formula that made ""Alien"" click. Like ""Alien"" the new movie derives its appeal not only from stunning otherworldly imagery but also from the central performances tasked with reacting to it. Noomi Rapace as one half of a researcher duo driven by ancient cave paintings to visit an alien planet and find the creatures that planted the origins of our DNA eons ago ably inherits the female survivalist throne from ""Alien"" queen Sigourney Weaver (and who better to do so than the original ""Girl With a Dragon Tattoo""?). Michael Fassbender as the ships artificial intelligence assigned by the missions benefactor to ensure its success delivers a chilly performance that suggests the love child of HAL 9000 and Spock. There are downsides to the familiar ingredients as well. Other characters including a barking ship manager played by Charlize Theron and an equally bland captain played by Idris Elba fall back on cliches and distract from an otherwise compelling ensemble. By its wild finish however ""Prometheus"" is an unquestionable good time one of the best big-screen science fiction accomplishments since ""Avatar"" -- and in some ways more impressive for its efficient combination of effects wizardry and sleek contained suspense. Appropriately the credits include a nod to the late great Dan OBannon author of the first ""Alien"" screenplay and a collaborator on John Carpenters debut feature ""Dark Star."" A primal version of ""Prometheus"" ""Dark Star"" also revolves around space travelers stuck in a maze of technological and organic problems largely of their own creation. Going one step further OBannons ""Alien"" concept worked so well partly because it left much of the explanation up to the imagination of the viewer. In the same tradition ""Prometheus"" relies on running and gunning seriously intense body horror and breathless dialogue about religious fate even more than on the modicum of discussion about whats actually going on. By the time a large tentacled creature has wrapped its tendrils around the neck of an equally menacing foe logic has given way to intense immersion. Once the monstrosities take over the characters entanglement calls to mind something out of Andrzej Zulawskis ""Possession"" in which the creature features purely represent a frantic state of mind. As the robotic Fassbender deadpans when one of the scientists insists on uncovering the aliens motives ""The answer is irrelevant."" Indeed. As with Lindelofs ""Lost"" the fun lies in the chaos of the moment. This has been a terrific summer for science fiction to rediscover its roots on a small scale. Panos Cosmatos supremely trippy ""Beyond the Black Rainbow"" now in limited release resurrects the iconography of ""Alien""-era science fiction while pushing it to a wholly abstract arena of sights and sounds that put it in league with ""Eraserhead"" in terms of midnight movie excess. ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" opening this Friday uses time travel to instigate a charming romantic comedy about regret. Spanish director Nacho Vigalondos ""Extraterrestrial"" opening next week in New York and also hitting VOD similarly uses minimal science fiction components -- a UFO hovering over a barren town -- to set in motion the relationships between a quartet of characters crammed in an apartment for the majority of its runtime. In each case plot specifics form only one part of the story. So it goes with ""Prometheus"" as well. The movie only makes enough sense to keep barreling forward to a thrilling climax and then it closes the loop with a final nod to its precedent (no specific spoilers but fans of a certain franchise should expect a climactic big reveal). ""Prometheus"" never transcends the boundaries of its narrative but despite the alien setting its familiar patterns have an oddly soothing effect. Criticwire grade B+ HOW WILL IT PLAY? With Foxs carefully engineered marketing strategy still working its magic ""Prometheus"" is set to open strong in wide release this weekend and become one of the summers biggest box office hits.

It looked great but at that budget level it should do. Hell my film would The story was a mess; plus it had sloppy characterisation. My expectations were high for a contemplative shocking thought provoking film which I spent my APS8 quid on. Instead I had a nice chance to catch up with some mates (we went as a group) and some poorly conceived film school effort. This film is one of the reasons I go less frequently to see big films a they are so poor and devoid of credible narrative drive. Kenneth UK a|yeah I could only wish to have 100th of that budget and my film would leave you very satisfied. Reply eutrophicated1 May 12 2016 334 pm The writers seemed to hate the characters they wrote about. because they made them do so many stupidly self-destructive things I couldnt like them either. Any half decent Sci Fi writer would know 1. You dont land your main source of transportation directly on an alien planet 2. And you dont land anything on an alien planet till youve done exhaustive remote surveys first. It looked as if the bankers who were backing the film didnt supply a good enough budget either; which is probably why there were no remote survey scenes creative depictions of even simple life forms or decent virtual views of planets from space. Another desert planet landscape. Please no more of this stuff. Reply Carolus May 12 2016 334 pm Seriously guys if you dont like sci-fi films save your time and dont make any more stupid comments about Prometheus. Also dont waste the time of its fans and next time dont waste your own money and words if you already know you are not going to like the film. Prometheus will stand on its own as one of the greatest sci-fi films of the decade whether you like it or not is not important. Reply Rohan May 12 2016 334 pm IndieWire.Com please put this article back on the front page so it get the readers attention again. Mainly because I want to add my opinion on the film a bit here briefly actually and then I will also share a link no direspect to this article which I enjoyed reading the first time. After reading some of the comments here and other movie-goers comments regarding PROMETHEUS being boring redundant and that their opinion is better than Ridley Scott is quite shocking. Why did you hate Prometheus? - Is it because it asks some important and burning questions that you cannot answer? - Or is it because todays film-goers are stuck in the corrider of straightforwardness? I do blame studios here for bringing less films like PROMETHEUS INCEPTION for film-goers and when films like mentioned titles comes out audiences and most critics I have to add them as well here bash the film because of its original concept and that it is not straightforward. My comment can get long but I dont have the time now to type more. If you like to read my brief point of view on Prometheus please give this link a visit (http//www.mastersofcinema.net/2012/06/point-of-view-prometheus/). Thank you Reply jim May 12 2016 334 pm Really boring movie. Another ""Hugo"" if you will. People want to be entertained when they go see a movie-on this point alone Prometheus fails miserably. The worst part of this movie is that the story is so stupid and riddled with plotholes that it insults your intelligence and just kills your suspension of disbelief. Ridley Scott hasnt made a good movie since Black Hawk Down. I think part of the problem is that he has not chosen good scripts lately. Visually Ridley Scott is a genius but movie audiences want a story and characters they can relate to-Prometheus is such a huge disappointment in this respect. Nice visuals but no heart. Prometheus never connects with the audience at any point and this is a real problem. Even the corny Dances with Smurfs by James Cameron was miles better than Prometheus because audiences could relate to some aspects of the story and characters. Honestly since 1986s Aliens there hasnt been a truly great sci-fi movie. Aliens just hit all the right buttons-great characters great suspense and thrills and great action. Who can forget Ripley in mum mode kicking the alien queens ass? It just connects instantly with audiences-there was no need for tons of meaningless semi-mysterious dialogue like in Prometheus. Everyone understands how ferocious a mum can get when defending her child people get this instantly. There is nothing like this in Prometheus just emotionless dialogue and characters doing stupid irrational things. Wish that movie directors in general would study Aliens and get back to basics. Seriously folks this is not rocket science-people just want to be entertained. If youre going to spend hundreds of millions on a movie (1)dont insult the audiences intelligence and (2)make sure the movie is entertaining. Look at Avengers 2012 not a classic by any means but entertaining and it cleaned out at the box-office. Heck even The Artist 2011 was way more entertaining than Prometheus-and it was made on a 15 million budget in black and white If Blade Runner 2 is going to be more drivel like Prometheus seriously Scott-dont bother. The best science fiction movie in the past 3 years remains District 9-made on a small budget yet was superbly entertaining and thought-provoking. Even ""Moon"" by Duncan Jones (another sci-fi movie made on a small budget) kicks Prometheus ass bigtime. Reply SaneMovieGoer May 12 2016 334 pm What? This movie was TERRIBLE I hate that pure nostalgia and Ridley Scotts patented visual effects that give a nod to his great Alien franchise will invoke so many people to pretend that this was a good movie Take away the glitz glamour and HYPE and this is a B movie barely deserving to appear on the Sci-fi channel. Someone should tell Mr. Scott that hes not making a motion painting where visuals are all that matter but that hes making a movie that needs something resembling a story... They fly half a billion miles and spend a trillion dollars because they found some cave drawings that seem to match a distant solar system? (Okay heck of a leap already but its a movie Ill let it go) Then they make a RANDOM assumption that they are our creators and when asked why she literally shrugs and says ""because thats what I believe"". THATS WHAT FUELS THE WHOLE FREAKING STORY Leading the biggest expedition in the history of mankind based on nothing more than one womans whim? Okay. Fine. Movie could still redeem itself. Except it proposes all these questions and NEVER answer any of them. It gets to the aliens which one would think would be the redeeming part considering its Ridley Scott but instead you are left confused... Theres a worm like creature that turns the guy into zombie... a little egg that begins to turn a guy into an alien called the Engineer (I think not really explained) who has sex with a girl giving birth to a squid... a squid that becomes a gigantic version that subdues another engineer alien with the classic alien face-hugger method... which gives birth to the classic alien at the end of the movie. Sound stupid? Its because it is stupid. So please explain to me how this was a good movie beyond mere hype and nostalgia? Please? Reply Alan May 12 2016 334 pm Oh give me a break. This film is utter hypocrisy Scott says it is ahem intelligent sci-fi but resorts to cliches in its characters and situations. Shaw and Holloway are soooooooooo interesting because one is a believer and the other isnt and ... oh wait thats it huh? Thats the depth of their relationship? Sean Harris is a very interesting actor but you wouldnt know it from this film the guy he plays only ever spouts inane annoying cliches (""I like money"") and - instead of being the audience surrogate as intended - he becomes very annoying very quickly. And I had to stop myself at laughing from the Vickers revelation which - like so many things in the script - has little-to-no influence on the rest of the film. (Same goes from some of Vicker and Davids choices which do not impact on the story at all). Frankly Scott is like that ex who promises to change and that things will be different this time but doesnt and then blames you for not understanding him. Reply Rohan May 12 2016 334 pm I find this review quite interesting for it gives the film a chance and doesnt ruin the expectation for others. I am sure that I will enjoy the film. Afterall its Mr. Scott who is on the directors chair here. Reply Paul May 12 2016 334 pm A very satisfying movie seen it twice already and will be going back for thirds. Ridley innovated and didnt try to replicate shrewd clever and pays off in spades. Reply Simone May 12 2016 334 pm Glad you guys like it. I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars too. It didnt have the intense dreadful fear of Alien but its a damn good film. Im going to watch it for a second time this weekend Reply Tomris Laffly May 12 2016 334 pm Ive anticipated it for so long but in the end I was disappointed. Too flat and empty. I didnt care at all for Elizabeth Shaws religious aspirations which is a huge conflict with Prometheus mission. Too many plot loopholes and things that have no reason to happen. But strangely I was entertained. And agreed that performances were incredible (especially by Fassbender). I wrote this on my blog http//bit.ly/KLbQHX Reply KRS May 12 2016 334 pm Not on par with ""Alien"" but more enjoyable than ""Avatar."" Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

It is incidentally the story of an ambitious mission gone wrong. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The discovery of a cave painting on the Isle of Skye is the ""X marks the spot"" moment. Comparing ancient pictograms from the world over an archaeologist couple Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway (Noomi Rapace and Logan Marshall-Green) find a recurring image that depicts humanitys titan forebears pointing skyward to a formation of planets that are always arranged the same across all cultural boundaries. This is enough to secure shady corporate backing for a trip to a distant galaxy where precisely that formation has been discovered a quest for answers as to the origins of humanity from the beings that Shaw and Holloway hope to find there ""We call them Engineers"" Shaw says. ""They engineered us.""Prone to shallow ponderousness Prometheus works best when it steps back from contemplating the cosmos to enter the domain of flesh-and-blood and hereditary terror. There are a few set pieces here that will find a place of honor among aficionados of body horror and all things clammy and viscous that will stain the memory long after such significant-sounding bits of dialogue like ""That being said doesnt everyone want their parents dead?"" have gone.The events of Prometheus take place at the end of 2093 as the exploratory missions crew awakens from suspended-animation stasis Shaw and Holloway are joined by the ships squeezebox-toting Captain Janek (Idris Elba) and working according to her own mysterious m.o. mission director Vickers (Charlize Theron as an ice queen wearing her hair in a sculptural blond knot). There are also a number of superfluous crew members who might as well be wearing Star Trek red shirts for on this trip to meet their makers many will.The deep-space deep-freeze commute will be familiar to most viewers from Alien directed some 33 years ago by Scott as will be the steel-ribbed organic-industrial H.R. Giger-deco interiors of the seemingly abandoned compound that the landing party finds--housing Engineer carcasses mysterious bongo-shaped canisters and prehistoric monoliths--upon setting down at the distant moon that is their star-mapped destination.The script by Jon Spaihts and Losts Damon Lindelof originated as a prequel to Alien Scotts first hit before developing into its present spin-off form. Rather than setting out as scriptwriter Dan OBannon did with the original to build the ultimate creature feature these gimcrack philosophers have loosely sown Prometheus with Big Themes in hopes that one might perchance take root.Shaw a nominal Christian simultaneously grapples with the mystery of creation and her own (routinely established) sterility. The title citing the mythical benefactor who stole fire from the Gods for mankind is also the name of our good spaceship carrying a freight of associations of forbidden knowledge. Frankenstein Mary Shelleys story of man tampering in Gods domain by creating life was subtitled ""A Modern Prometheus."" Scotts film features the product of a future Prometheus David (Michael Fassbender) the ships android factotum and caretaker. David stars in the films single most original sequence using the Prometheus as his private playground while the mere mortals that he serves slumber fixing his hair like Peter OTooles after watching Lawrence of Arabia and effortlessly sinking impossible hook shots in the gymnasium.Fassbender gives a wry performance of crisp precise gestures but the characters programmed motivations and motives dont quite scan. One bit of business which involves him slipping someone a mickey is simply baffling while scenes that reveal David betraying an expression of private pleasure needlessly tease one to wonder if he is really such an unfeeling automaton.The same sense of buildup toward a payoff that never arrives--are we supposed to placidly await a sequel?--defines Prometheus. This feels less like deliberate open-ending than an inability to control tone and effect. Although supposedly our point of entry into the narrative Rapace and Marshall-Green inspire no interest in their fate as a couple and a scene that calls upon them to perform a wrenching act of sacrifice only reminds one how Brian de Palma even with a problematic property like 2000s Mission to Mars could invest similar material with eloquence and pathos.Inviting comparison to The Tree of Lifes formation-of-the-universe digression or 2001 A Space Odysseys monolith overture Prometheus begins with a freestanding prologue imagining our planets infancy. Scott is swinging for the fences here--he is 74 and perhaps looking for a career-capping legacy film to tackle life the universe and everything--but his gifts have coarsened considerably over the past decade. With this overreaching Prometheus Scott seems a bit like David carefully arranging his hair in imitation of OTooles Lawrence. He can still mimic the appearance of an epic noble important movie--but the appearance is all.1 Michael Fassbender gives a wry performance.20th Century Fox Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Nick Pinkerton Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Ridley says no everyone else says yes - the viral clips the teasers the trailers the teasers-for-trailers the press conferences the wild anticipation and Prometheus turns out to be... well just another monsters-in-space movie. Thats not the whole story of course - as sci-fi horror movies go this is a pretty expensive epic ideas-heavy example of the genre. But its far from the game-changer some had hoped for and it may in fact leave some viewers entirely baffled.If youve seen the trailers youll know the basic plot in the year 2089 archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) stumble across a pictogram hidden in a cave on the Isle of Skye. Matching it with etchings found across the globe they conclude that the drawings constitute a star map. And when dying multi-billionaire (Guy Pearce) agrees to fund a mission the two doctors head out into the cosmos aboard the starship Prometheus to find they hope an answer to the questions of life the universe and everything.What they find is of course far slimier and less friendly. Arriving on a distant rocky moon in the company of android David (Michael Fassbender) hard-ass corporate stooge Vickers (Charlize Theron) cigar-chomping ships captain Janek (Idris Elba) and sundry other scantily characterised and wholly expendable shipmates they stumble across a giant structure buried in the soil. Could this hold the key to mankinds origins?Theres plenty to recommend in Prometheus the photography is pleasingly crisp and the design is stunning nicely redolent of Alien and its sequels. There is a small handful of truly bracing set pieces - one scene inside a medical pod is without doubt the most heart-poundingly memorable moment of the blockbuster season so far.But its flaws are impossible to ignore. The script feels flat - a few pleasing nods to the original movies aside the dialogue is lazy while the plot though crammed with striking concepts simply fails to coalesce. After an enjoyable setup the central act is baggy confusing and in places slightly boring while the climax has flash and fireworks but no real momentum. There just doesnt seem to be much logic at work here. Some events - such as one crew member going tonto on his shipmates - seem to happen because its expected from the genre not because they make much sense. And fans of Alien will feel shortchanged the script makes no real effort to pre-empt that film and in fact is happy to ignore it altogether while at the same time eagerly exploiting its beautiful HR Giger spaceship design. The ending is left wide open for a sequel which may close some of the bigger story holes but theres still a frustrating lack of care being taken here.Perhaps more than any other film Prometheus is reminiscent of Chris Nolans Inception its slick gorgeously designed and scattered with intriguing concepts. But theres just no real power behind it. The characters are thin and emotionless the plot twists are predictable and the entire thing seems built on ideas plucked from superior predecessors (in addition to the original Alien movies theres a little bit of 2001 A Space Odyssey a touch of The Abyss and a whole lot of Star Trek). Theres no denying that Prometheus will make for a perfectly entertaining night at the movies - but we were promised so much more.

Just because I did not respond to your ridiculous comments (and immediately) it appears that you have gone on a paranoid ranting campaign. It is laughable how sad you are replying to posts between midnight and 3am in the morning. Some of us have other things to do with our lives (like work and play) and not live on this forum. I had merely understood that I had said everything that needs to be said to you regarding your posts. Your mentality and responses are so predicableaEUR|. Now it seems that you are so paranoid by my absence that you are now accusing other forum members of being me and vice versa. Really? I never said the film was aEURoesoo badaEUR (how old are you again Rimmer?) I actually believe it is no more than an average film. On the whole it is arguably not as good as you say it is and not as bad as other say it is. But it is a very poor offering from a director with the experience and standing of RS and comes nowhere near the level of hype generated. The problem I have with the weirdoaEUR(tm)s like you on this forum is that as soon as somebody gives a negative rating or review (for whatever reason) you start aEUR~TrollingaEUR(tm). I have merely defended the rights of others to say whatever they like about the film without being stalked by oddballs. I am not sorry if my opinion offends you. For what it is worth I have never used any other name to make my points. Any future silence from me will not be out of any perceived defeat or fear of weirdoaEUR(tm)s like you (far from it). But pity for you both as you need me to respond to your inane commentary to be able to add some purpose to your very sad lives. Off you go now to fashion some sad and poorly spelt response.

So I feel for ""Prometheus"" Ridley Scotts prequel to his 1979 sci-fi horror classic ""Alien."" If his latest film were allowed to be unaffiliated with a hit franchise and could be graded on its own merits it would be a sleek scientists-in-space thriller. Taken as a film that has to follow in the slime-encrusted footsteps of the elegantly terrifying ""Alien"" and James Camerons intensely thrilling ""Aliens"" however ""Prometheus"" cant help feeling like something of an also-ran. While it certainly delivers in many ways the film ultimately winds up playing like very expensive fan-fiction for people who would have liked ""2001"" better had everything been explained. Set at the turn of the 22nd century ""Prometheus"" follows archeologists Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green looking a lot like Tom Hardy) into deep space. They have discovered cave paintings around the world from different eras that depict space visitors and a cluster of five orbs and now the fine folks at Weyland Industries have paid for the scientists to go on an expedition to a corner of the universe that matches these ancient maps in the hopes of finding the creators of life on Earth. If youve watched any of the ""Alien"" movies you know that corporate interests are never to be trusted. And from the first film you also know to keep an eye on the android; this time its David (Michael Fassbender) whos got the Weyland logo for fingerprints and a deep and abiding love for Peter OTooles performance in ""Lawrence of Arabia."" David and the icy Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) represent the company the crew of academics (which also includes Rafe Spall and Sean Harris) are making the journey for science and the grunts (led by Idris Elbas Captain Janek) are there to get paid. Once they land the travelers discover chambers full of very suspicious-looking goo-goo clusters and as Weylands agenda becomes known the screaming starts. As does the eviscerating. Scott certainly knows his way around a gleaming surface and he also knows how to build extraordinary tension particularly in one unforgettable sequence involving Rapace an intrusive alien and a surgery machine. (If youre afraid of slimy beasts and operations consider this a two-fer.) But his gifts as a filmmaker are undercut by the script by Jon Spaihts (""The Darkest Hour"") and Damon Lindelof (""Lost"") which goes out of its way to avoid being even the slightest bit enigmatic. All of the major plot points are either utterly predictable or thoroughly explained by one of the characters and that becomes kind of a drag after a while. Nonetheless theres tons of suspense monsters-a-go-go and strong performances from the whole cast. Since the original ""Alien"" gave us Sigourney Weavers Ripley who redefined the notion of sexy women who were fully capable of ass-kicking its fitting that Scott cast two actresses very much in that tradition. Rapace after being wasted in the ""Sherlock Holmes"" sequel finally gets an American movie that plays to her intensity -- not to mention the fact theres something almost alien about her unusual and beautiful physiognomy -- and Theron playing it cool and deadpan delivers the complete antithesis of her camp-queen overacting in ""Snow White and the Huntsman."" Alien DNA plays a big role in ""Prometheus"" but its the DNA of ""Alien"" that this new movie just cant quite live up to. The less you think of this new film as part of that legendary series the more youll enjoy it. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

A mission to uncover the origins of human life yields familiar images of death and devastation in ""Prometheus."" Elaborately conceived from a visual standpoint Ridley Scotts first sci-fier in the three decades since ""Blade Runner"" remains earthbound in narrative terms forever hinting at the existence of a higher intelligence without evincing much of its own. Foxs midsummer tentpole has generated considerable excitement since it was announced the film would share some story DNA with Scotts 1979 horror landmark ""Alien"" and a marketing push promising comparable levels of gore and tension should ensure that ""Prometheus"" catches B.O. fire. Establishing its intertwined themes of creation and destruction from the outset the picture opens with eerily beautiful shots of a planet seemingly in the early stages of an evolutionary renaissance then cuts to the grim sight of a pale-skinned humanoid ingesting a fatal toxin. Some time later specifically December 2093 scientist couple Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) are aboard the spaceship Prometheus leading a crew that hopes to make contact with the alien beings that initiated life on Earth. Holloway is something of a skeptic which naturally means he may as well have ""dead meat"" embroidered on his spacesuit. Shaw however is a true believer someone whos ""willing to discount three centuries of Darwinism"" as one colleague snorts and who pointedly wears a cross necklace under her lab coat. Having studied recurring patterns in ancient cave paintings the world over shes convinced the primitive images contain a message from the alien beings that created mankind inviting people of Earth to meet their makers. This unfortunately turns out to be true in every sense. Also along for the ride are a dryly efficient captain (Idris Elba); a corporate ball-buster (Charlize Theron) who challenges Shaw and Holloways authority at every step; and most intriguingly David (Michael Fassbender) a super-intelligent android who nonetheless possesses a dangerously childlike curiosity. Landing in a parched-looking valley on an unfamiliar planet the scientists venture into an underground cavern whose malevolent contents immediately bring ""Alien"" to mind and it seems at first that ""Prometheus"" will follow a similar outline as the crew unwisely decides to bring specimens back to the ship. Yet a key difference between this film and its predecessor is one of volume. Incongruously backed by an orchestral surge of a score the film conspicuously lacks the long drawn-out silences and sense of menace in close quarters that made ""Alien"" so elegantly unnerving. Prometheus is one chatty vessel populated by stock wise-guy types who spout tired one-liners when theyre not either cynically debunking or earnestly defending belief in a superior power. The pictures very structure serves to disperse rather than build tension cross-cutting regularly between the underground chamber where two geologists (Sean Harris Rafe Spall) meet an ugly end and the ship where efforts to contain the threat are thwarted by the increasingly uncertain chain of command. Scott and his production crew compensate to some degree with an intricate immersive visual design that doesnt skimp on futuristic eye-candy or prosthetic splatter. In the films most squirm-inducing moment Shaw must climb into an auto-surgery machine to eliminate an alien attacker from her body; its a cleverly sustained sequence that hits the viewers recoil button even as its display of technological innovation fascinates. Also providing flickers of engagement are the semi-provocative ideas embedded in Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelofs screenplay. The continual discussions of creation vs. creator and the attitude of one toward the other supply the film with a philosophical dimension that its straightforward space-opera template doesnt have the bandwidth to fully explore. Indeed the crucial question of why the planets inhabitants are so intent on wiping out a race they engineered is lazily deferred until a putative sequel. Still the film contains the ideal embodiment of its sly existential paradox in David the man-made manservant whose soulfully soulless presence brings to mind both ""A.I."" and ""2001""; hes like HAL 9000 with better cheekbones. In a particularly witty touch Fassbenders droll performance takes its cues from Peter OToole in ""Lawrence of Arabia"" a clip of which David continually watches as a model for how to behave around humans. Other thesps are just passable with the exception of Rapace who gets to express intense physical and emotional agony in a register entirely different from that of her star-making turns in the Swedish version of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" and its sequels. For the record thats Guy Pearce buried under pounds of disfiguring special-effects makeup in the role of the aging visionary who bankrolled the mission. The ships moniker derives from the myth of a fire-stealing Titan who sought to eliminate the gap between mortals and the gods and fittingly enough theres a warped Greco-Roman accent to the richly imagined visuals particularly when the characters get a look at the malign beings in whose image they were created. H.R. Gigers iconic design elements remain a key influence here particularly in the gratuitous parting shot.

Daily Edition Login to download Prometheus Film Review 1200 AM PDT 5/30/2012 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Twentieth Century Fox A visually stunning return to science fiction by Ridley Scott caters too much to audience expectations when more imaginative boldness would have taken it further. TWITTER Although Ridley Scottas 3D visual feast is no classic the oozing alien tentacles hit all the right sci-fi horror notes. Be careful what you wish for especially if it involves figuring out who invented humankind. Thats the warning at the heart of Prometheus a visual feast of a 3D sci-fi movie that has trouble combining its high-minded notions about the origins of the species and its   Alien  -based obligation to deliver oozy gross-out moments. Ridley Scotts third venture into science fiction after   Alien   in 1979 and Blade Runner in 1982 wont become a genre benchmark like those classics despite its equivalent seriousness and ambition but it does supply enough visual spectacle tense action and sticky slithery monster attacks to hit the spot with thrill-seeking audiences worldwide. The Greek titan Prometheus got in trouble for stealing fire from Zeus and putting man on the same level as the gods. Presuming that humans wont rest until we discover where we came from and how we got here Prometheus proposes that not very long from now in 2093 to be precise a plausible source of human life will not only be found but reached by space explorers backed not surprisingly by private not government interests. EXCLUSIVE PHOTOS Never-Seen Photos From Prometheus The striking opening sequence (shot in Iceland) reveals scientist Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace the original Girl With the Dragon Tattoo) discovering ancient cave paintings indicating the likely arrival on Earth of extraterrestrials many thousands of years ago. Such evidence points to the source as a moon in a small solar system a vast distance away but not out of reach of a trillion-dollar spacecraft built by Weyland Industries. The buildup and arrival are the best part of the film suggesting a sense of inquiry and genuine sort of thoughtfulness that promise a truly weighty slice of speculative fiction. Not that this territory hasnt been amply mined in the past In fact the particulars of the ships interior design visual projections hibernating crew members sports workout routines and Michael Fassbenders robot character as a sort of ambulatory HAL with an obsession to look and speak like Peter OToole in Lawrence of Arabia which he likes to watch are unavoidably reminiscent of 2001 A Space Odyssey. PHOTOS 28 of Summers Most Anticipated Movies Avengers Dark Knight Prometheus Little by little however elements of other less philosophical films come into play including Fantastic Voyage Rosemarys Baby and inevitably Alien. Arriving on the rugged outwardly lifeless moon the 17 crew members notice pyramid-like structures that were clearly not fashioned by nature. Inside the elaborate tunnels and chambers possess moisture elaborate writing a large statue of a human head and more alarming countless small cylinders that produce a sticky mud-like substance and an apparent human head. It doesnt take long for the crews number to be reduced by untoward circumstances nor for doubt to set in about the true agenda not only of Fassbenders David who can be quietly amusing but of Charlize Therons Meredith Vickers the chilly Weyland executive on board who condescendingly treats everyone else including the ships captain (Idris Elba) as vastly inferior employees. PHOTOS Ridley Scotts Life and Work Elizabeth and her scientist boyfriend Charlie (Logan Marshall-Green) continue to spar about the potential momentousness of their journey -- she who wears a cross hopes to find confirmation of her religious beliefs that will point to the existence of a traditional creator while he is convinced that what they discover will merely prove once and for all that Darwin was right. But such rarefied considerations are thrown overboard when aliens start materializing shooting their tentacles where you definitely dont want them getting someone pregnant and otherwise causing the same sort of mayhem they always have in outer-space monster films. As the survivors are pared down to a precious few the grisliness and gross-out quotient increases; a self-inflicted cesarian section may be a screen first (certainly the result of it is) while Fassbenders fate is similarly imaginative and far funnier. This project started life as an intended prequel to Alien but morphed into something else. Unfortunately the closer it comes to a climax the more you feel the elements being lined up to set the stage for a sequel to this film most of all in a coda that feels like a craven teaser trailer for the next installment. THR COVER STORY Secrets of Ridley Scotts Prometheus Scott doubles his Alien pleasure with not just one but two strong female roles here. Rapace credibly expresses her characters combined scientific and religious convictions -- ""Its what I choose to believe"" she insists -- and is more than up to the physical requirements of some very intense scenes. Theron is in ice goddess mode here with the emphasis on ice (and this just as her turn in Snow White and the Huntsman is about to open) but perfect for the role all the same. Blonded up perfect of diction and elegant of body Fassbender seems almost alarmingly neutered at first as the ships all-purpose valet but excels as hes allowed to begin injecting droll comedy into his performance. As the captain Elba has a few strong moments standing up to his ""boss"" Theron while the other actors are mostly cannon fodder save for an unrecognizable Guy Pearce in a late-on role. Technically Prometheus is magnificent. Shot in 3D but without the director taking the process into account in his conceptions or execution the film absorbs and uses the process seamlessly. There is nary a false or phony note in the effects supervised by Richard Stammers which build upon the outstanding production design by Arthur Max. Dariusz Wolskis graceful and vivid cinematography synthesizes all the elements beautifully in a film that caters too much to imagined audience expectations when a little more adventurous thought might have taken it to some excitingly unsuspected destinations.
