Starring Robert Downey Jr. Gwyneth Paltrow and Guy Pearce. Directed by Shane Black. (PG-13. 130 minutes.) A domestic terrorist is on the loose seizing control of the airwaves taunting the president and striking at will. He is targeting innocent civilians in major cities detonating bombs in crowded public places. Thus we begin the summer blockbuster season and such is the form that entertainment takes in ""Iron Man 3"" a not-bad third installment of the popular series. In another era the recent tragedy in Boston might have been enough to delay the films release. But you know the reasoning If you postpone a lighthearted movie featuring terrorism because of a terrorist attack then the terrorists win - or something like that. In any case though the timing isnt good ""Iron Man 3"" has good things in it enough to please the series fans - and yet too many drawbacks to win many converts. Among the movies assets is billionaire Tony Stark as played and embodied by Robert Downey Jr. A fascinating and troubled guy Tony cant sleep and when he does he has nightmares. He is prone to panic attacks and his only comfort is in making Iron Man suits. He seems to have an odd intuition that something bad is coming and hes right. The terrorist calls himself the Mandarin. Played by Ben Kingsley who ends up stealing the movie in unexpected ways (to be more than vague would spoil it) the Mandarin has an ancient Chinese haircut and a bin Laden beard. He looks like Americas worst nightmare and sounds like a Southern evangelist. Soon he is announcing that he is coming after the president. On one side theres the kind of movie ""Iron Man 3"" could be; on the other theres the kind of movie it has to be (in order to qualify as an action blockbuster). The creative tension between those two poles lets the movie reintroduce the enigmatic Stark character ... but then makes him mostly about the suit. It allows the movie to bring in an arresting concept - a scientist (Rebecca Hall) develops a way of supercharging the brains capacity for regeneration - but then doesnt develop that concept in a way that makes logical sense. Worst of all we get a movie with authentic flashes of wit and adult intelligence ... that inevitably must derail into the Land of Stupid with a prolonged action sequence that looks like nothing but a mess slopped onto a computer screen. Its as if the movie werent made for an American audience at all but for a foreign audience that wouldnt understand anyway and just wants to see Hollywood-scale spectacle. Guy Pearce plays a charismatic lunatic who puts together an army of people whose limbs he regenerated but there is no explanation as to why someone with a brand-new arm should turn evil. For this audience presumably its just enough that it happens. Meanwhile the rules change from scene to scene. Sometimes the Iron Man suit can do anything sometimes it cant. Sometimes the re-limbed beings are just a little stronger than normal people. Sometimes theyre all but invincible. Sometimes Stark can fight one off even without his suit; at other times the suit is no match for any of them. The strength of every character is endlessly revisable according to the convenience of director Shane Black and his co-screenwriters. As Starks companion Gwyneth Paltrow is lovely and alert to every bit of emotional life that the filmmakers want to feed her. But then all the actors are that way here Downey Kingsley (who is wonderful) Pearce and Don Cheadle - no one wants to feel as though he or she were slumming. But really? Really? Thats exactly what theyre doing even though this slum is very expensive. By the way the MPAA should stop playing games. The violence here - extreme relentless and disturbing - deserves an R rating.

Once a preeminent enabler of Hollywoods addiction to excess--he was the screenwriter for Lethal Weapon The Last Boy Scout Last Action Hero and The Long Kiss Goodnight--Black subsequently took a decade off before offering amends as the writer/director of 2005s Kiss Kiss Bang Bang a wicked ironic homage to the hard-boiled noir. That film not coincidentally was also a key step in the comeback of one Robert Downey Jr. who had recently taken his own hiatus from cinema at the request of law enforcement. Related Story Danny Boyles Trance Offers a Woozy Ride Now the two have reunited for Iron Man 3 which shares many of the strengths--and a few of the weaknesses--of their previous collaboration. Chief among these is the obvious chemistry between the two Black excels at writing witty self-referential pop-infused banter and there is no actor working today who is better suited to delivering it than Downey. Like Kiss Kiss Bang Bang their new movie opens with a voiceover by Downey (this time as Tony Stark) in which he again displays his extraordinary gift for carrying on conversations with himself. ""A famous man once said we create our own demons"" he begins. ""Who said that? It doesnt matter. Now two famous guys have said it."" He pauses. ""Im gonna start again.""Black and Downey depart from the usual superhero script in a variety of ways but perhaps most notable is the decision to strip Stark of his Iron Man suit for most of the middle third of the film. And for the record our hero fares quite nicely with just the goatee irony and self-love. A mysterious and theatrical terrorist the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) has begun a bombing campaign against U.S. targets and when one of its victims is Starks own bodyguard Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau who directed the first two films in the franchise) Stark issues the villain a personal challenge. It is however an ill-advised one as the Mandarin responds by sending helicopter gunships to demolish Starks seaside Malibu mansion. Missiles are launched last-second evacuations are achieved and the house falls beneath the waves as spectacularly as any since Usher.Unconscious Stark is auto-piloted away from the scene by his own armor to rural Tennessee where hed planned to investigate a lead involving an explosion that may be connected to the Mandarin. And investigate he does though without the help of said armor the batteries of which are in terminal need of recharging. In place of his super-suit Stark enlists the aid of a young boy named Harley (Ty Simpkins) ...Yes this is the moment in virtually every action movie when the script descends into cloying sentimentality The plucky kid breaks through the emotional barriers of the walled-off hero etc. etc. I know this and you know this. But more importantly Shane Black knows this and he has an enormously amusing time subverting the trope. In the last outing Tony Stark the man was largely lost amid the mechanized mayhem. But this time around Black advances the counterintuitive insight that the more Iron Man suits he throws into the fray the less they actually matter.Iron Man 3 is full of such knowing touches. The script which Black co-wrote with Drew Pearce features references to Scott Baio and Downton Abbey and Westworld along with barbs evidently aimed at U.S. defense policy Starks buddy James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) stumbles around Pakistan in red-white-and-blue armor and the government is all too eager to fall for fictive threats. On a more self-referential level there are a few light jokes at the expense of The Avengers (""Ever since the guy with the hammer fell out of the sky subtlety kind of went out of the window"") and at least one line that I took as a not terribly veiled shot at the frustrations reportedly internal as well as external of Iron Man 2 when Stark explains""You start with something pure something exciting. Then come the mistakes the compromises."" That said Blacks movie is not without its own flaws. As he did in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang he seems to have taken to heart the Raymond Chandler admonition that the ""scenes outrank the plot"" For all the pleasures offered by the former the latter is a bit of a convoluted mess. It involves two scientist/entrepreneurs (played by Guy Pearce and Rebecca Hall) whom Stark met at a 1999 New Years Eve party where he stood one up and had a one-night stand with the other. The two have since been developing the Extremis virus a serum that provides its recipients with powers of regeneration super-strength and the ability to generate heat--the only side effect being a tendency on occasion to spontaneously combust. Though the exact relationship is initially unclear the two now seem to have some connection to the Mandarin. Kingsley is marvelous as the terrorist kingpin Festooned in robes his hair braided and fingers heavy with rings Sir Ben chews his vowels as if they were beef jerky and harbors a Terrible Secret. Alas despite their talents Pearce Hall and the rest of the cast--which includes James Badge Dale as a villainous heavy and Gwyneth Paltrow Cheadle and the voice of Paul Bettany reprising their customary roles--are given far less opportunity to rise above their narrative obligations. The villains ultimate motives meanwhile are difficult to ascertain some heady goulash of wanting to enlist Starks financial support wanting to rule the world and wanting a date with Paltrows Pepper Potts. It all ends as these exercises inevitably must with a massive action sequence in which an army of Extremis-enhanced soldiers spars with a dozen or so remote-controlled suits of Iron Man armor. If this finale sounds reminiscent of the clunking conclusion of Iron Man 2 it is--and it isnt. In the last outing Tony Stark the man was largely lost amid the mechanized mayhem. But this time around Black advances the counterintuitive insight that the more Iron Man suits he throws into the fray the less they actually matter. Their destruction one after another serves as an advertisement of their disposability. Who cares? Stark can always build more. The only irreplaceable ingredient is him.Indeed Blacks movie--an ungainly circuitous and yet profoundly satisfying contribution to Iron Mania--ends on exactly this note. ""You can take away my house all my tricks and toys"" Downeys Stark explains. ""The one thing you cant take away I am Iron Man."" Amen to that.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

After Khizr Khan spoke politicians and commentators on most networks said they were moved humbled inspired choked up.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

""You cant leave yet"" she told the stranger. ""Marvel movies always have something after the credits."" He paused then dutifully sat back down. She was right of course. There is indeed an amusing bit at the end of a very long credit roll. Without spoiling the joke we can say that it speaks to the pleasures but also the failings of this latest installment of the Tony Stark/Robert Downey Jr. show which finds the superhero wrestling with his narcissism but Hollywood willfully avoiding its own need for a little behavior modification. When last we saw the buff billionaire geek and his metallurgic alter ego he was hanging out in New York City with the Avengers. As this story gets underway he hasnt really made peace with all he learned about himself during that exquisitely heroic battle royal. So in his massive digs looking out over the Malibu seaside he tinkers stays awake hours on end worries his robot Jarvis (voiced by Paul Bettany) and tries not to worry live-in love Pepper Potts (Gwy-neth Paltrow). Potts heads Stark Industries and Happy (Jon Favreau) is now the bullish -- as in ""in-a-china-shop"" -- head of security for his friends vast corporation. Don Cheadle returns as Col. James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes whose superhero persona War Machine has been rebranded ""Iron Patriot"" by the government. Downey is as nimble and wisecracking as ever. When Stark meets and enlists the help of an 8-year-old tinkerer named Harley (Ty Simpkins) after disaster has struck his banter is fleet funny and a bit inappropriate. The actor wears this character like a second skin one in need of shedding perhaps. And director Shane Black and Drew Pearces script has Stark reckoning not only with past heroics but also with past hubris. The story flashes back to a 1999 New Years Eve party where Stark plays typically fast and loose with a genetic researcher he beds Dr. Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall) and is even more dismissive of a hobbled enthusiastic bio-entrepreneur named Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) who wants to pitch Hansen an idea. Those slights will come back to haunt him -- and the nation. ""Iron Man 3"" is in part a story about karmic comeuppance about Tony Starks easy arrogance finally catching up with him. Thats not the problem. It is also about terrorism which is. Things are set in motion with a deadly explosion outside the former Graumans Chinese Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard. Happy is injured which brings Iron Man into the picture. This set-up seems to combine the worst of actual recent events with the sorrow of last years shootings at an Aurora movie theater. Ben Kingsley is disquieting as a figure calling himself The Mandarin (an update of the comic books fiend). He hijacks broadcasts to issue warnings and televise acts of violence. He has a long beard and wears his hair in a top knot. His shtick is all over the place. He definitely conjures the ghost of Osama bin Laden. He swings his ideological ax wildly. In one of his videotaped free associations he even mentions Colorados Sand Creek Massacre. Injured U.S. soldiers suffering limb loss and post-traumatic stress disorder also figure uncomfortably into the plot line. Killian -- once disabled now vigorous -- is using a genetically altered virus called Extremis to weaponize former soldiers. Iron Man 3 feels like an exploitative mulching of present-day anxieties. The script is ambitious but not wise enough to be rightfully cathartic. Its more Cuisinart than art. Still ""Iron Man 3"" is not without humor and Tony and Peppers relationship has charm. The movie also has a twist that is unexpected hilarious -- and strange enough that it suggests Black and Pearce were actually trying to insert kernels of wisdom in their big-popcorn flick. Only it happens too late into a PG-13 movie that allows too much mayhem when something more heroic is required. Tony Stark is growing up. But a similar transformation from the studios isnt so apparent. Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 lkennedydenverpost.com or twitter.com/bylisakennedy ""IRON MAN 3."" Directed by Shane Black.

This is good because the suit is an elegant metallic blank and is largely computer-generated and weve seen virtually (and I do mean virtually) everything that it can do while having to pretend to be convinced by little cut-ins of Robert Downey Jr.s face in alleged flight or battle. This is also good because two more hours of rock-em-sock-em CG robots would set up unfavorable comparisons to last summers superhero-franchise-tent-pole-orgasmatron The Avengers. Part Threes are notorious series killers and it boded well that Jon Favreau -- whose Iron Man 2 had narrative love handles from all the fat in its budget -- ceded the directors chair to the still-hungry Shane Black. Clearly Black understood that Downey had to be the heart (such as it is) of this thing and that no actor can triumph over a cartoon tin man. The idea is to kick Downeys billionaire industrialist Tony Stark out of his comfort zone so that instead of throwing money at every problem he has to function as a lone gumshoe think like a garage mechanic and when necessary MacGyver it up. In the script credited to Drew Pearce and Black Stark brings upon himself his exile into the low-tech wilderness. In 1999 he explains in voice-over he created his ""own demons"" -- blowing off a wide-eyed Uber-nerd (Guy Pearce) to sleep with a dishy biologist (Rebecca Hall). Having rooted the villains genesis in his heros character flaws Black proceeds to show the angry arrogant Stark doing a nyah-nyah-come-get-me-you-know-where-I-live routine to a robed terrorist mastermind called the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) whose (very exuberant) videos make plain that hes targeting the president of the United States and whose last explosion puts someone close to Stark into a coma. The rocket attack that takes out Starks high-tech cliffside manse has been the stuff of trailers for the last six months. I can only add that its even more impressive in 3-D that its fun to see the Iron Man suit on Gwynny Paltrows Pepper Potts and her panicked little blonde head in the inserts and that a shot in which the camera seems to plummet alongside Stark and the crumbling remains of his bombarded dwelling was probably not worth the money (which could have been used to feed and educate many poor children) but given that its already spent is a Triple-Decker Wowza with Cheese. The movies subsequent 90 minutes must have cost a lot too but the trick of the modern comic-book superhero picture is to make it look as if its makers are ""getting a little more real"" with the milieu. The milieu is no more real than half of Hollywoods heterosexual relationships but we so want to believe. The other problem with post-Avengers movies is that you wonder why Stark doesnt just pick up the phone and say ""Hey Captain A. I need a favor"" or ""Earth to Asgard come in Thor ... "" Iron Man 3 handles this not by pretending The Avengers didnt happen but by having Stark overbusy coping with the trauma of what everyone calls ""New York."" To add insult to PTSD his (Starks not Downeys) fans want to know more about the Avengers than Iron Man. One such fan is a too-snappy too-articulate too-hard-to-resist Tennessee adolescent named Harley Keener played by Ty Simpkins. Having a workshop handily abandoned six years earlier by his AWOL dad Harley trades insults with Stark while exhorting him to recover his inner garage-workshop-tinkerer. Their bickering produces one disconcertingly weird line following a vicious firefight between Stark and a female quasi-Terminator ""If you do someone a solid"" Stark tells the boy ""dont be a yutz"" -- probably the first time the phrase ""do a solid"" has been paired with the word yutz and certainly the first time ""yutz"" has been used by a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant superhero. The Jews really have infiltrated popular culture. Downey is less obnoxious than he was in The Avengers and more vulnerable partly because Black knows how to modulate his leading mans shtick -- Blacks Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005) was a jolly vehicle for the sardonic freshly sober Downey and the opening salvo of the actors triumphant comeback. Black is good at giving his heroes a morbid self-hating edge and even better at coming up with hateable villains. Unlike most comic-book directors he doesnt stint on the killings -- an attack on Air Force One has the body count of Air Force One in about 1/50th the time. The timing isnt great for an escapist romp that features explosions in public places in American cities. But this kind of picture always seems to get a pass the box-office take barely dented even by shooters in multiplexes. Nothing gets between us and our superhero blockbusters. As to the chemical and biological nature of the villain and his literally fire-breathing minions I wont ruin your day with any spoilers. I couldnt if I wanted to since I never fully understood their powers which expand and contract according to the needs of the script. I didnt care though Iron Man 3 has a lot of incident and the big action set pieces are at least coherent enough for us to know which way the shock waves are blowing. It would be nice if todays superhero didnt have the same ball-and-chain girlfriend who wants him to take fewer risks and put more effort into the relationship (""Eye contact Iron Man"" she doesnt say but might as well). But at least this time ""Goopy"" Paltrow gets to perform a few superheroics herself along with enduring some heavy-duty torture thats bound to please her haters -- for whom the sight of the top of her face being peeled off in Contagion was like Christmas in July. Iron Man 3 has an unusually high number of witty turns from Pearces clumping disfigured geek turned insinuating smoothie to Don Cheadles amusingly gung-ho Colonel Rhodes ever disheartened when he cant rocket around alongside Stark. I always enjoy seeing Dale Dickey who was so stunning as the hillbilly matriarch in Winters Bone and the meth fiend who in Breaking Bad dropped an ATM machine on her boyfriends head. The talented comic actor Adam Pally has an exuberant bit as a Stark groupie in a TV van. Its the sort of inspired silliness a movie like this needs and it also gives Downey a chance to prove what a brilliant straight man he can be -- he uses his superstar sense of entitlement to generate a great impatient slow burn. Finally we come to the Mandarin of Ben Kingsley whose beans I wouldnt dream of spilling. Every time I see Sir Ben I think hes due for another of Her Majestys honors Lord High Executioner of Mischief.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday May 03 2013 1201AM EDT Last updated Friday May 03 2013 1201AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Shane Black Written by Shane Black Drew Pearce Starring Robert Downey Jr. Ben Kingsley Guy Pearce Gwyneth Paltrow Classification PG Genre action Year 21013 Country USA Language English As appropriate to a movie as self-referential as Iron Man 3 the real question for audiences isnt whether Tony Stark/Iron Man defeats the latest supervillain (of course he does) but whether the movie itself rises above the dreaded third-in-a-sequel torpor of Spider-Man and The Dark Knight. Spoiler alert Yes mostly it does. Multimedia Iron Man 3 The official trailer Stronger than 2010s anemic Iron Man 2 though not as bold and shiny as the first film in the Marvel Comics-derived series Iron Man 3 adds a slightly fresh twist to the usual package of wisecracks and spectacle that led the first two films under Jon Favreaus direction to a 1.2-billion worldwide box office.This time Favreau has been replaced by director and co-writer Shane Black who brings his own baggage and bag of tricks. Black who first came to fame as the writer of one of the first smartly deranged action films 1987s Lethal Weapon went from hot to not in the early nineties (the low point was The Last Boy Scout). In the past decade he also directed Robert Downey Jr. in one of their mutual comeback movies 2005s smart crime film Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.Black who knows that Downey is Iron Mans best asset gets the actor out of the mask for much of the film. Even more than before the series feels as though it should probably be retitled Irony Man in Downeys honour. With his neurotic glib patter lounge-lizard goatee and moments of pop-eyed exasperation he adds an indispensable personal eccentricity to spice up the mundane business of saving the planet.The film begins with a prelude set on New Years Eve in the innocent days of 1999 and introduces us to a couple of characters from Tonys past who are ready to pop up again a botanist called Maya (Rebecca Hall) who is reconfiguring plant DNA with unfortunate explosive results and whom Tony beds in Switzerland at the end of a conference.On that same night he meets a needy nerdy scientist (bespectacled buck-toothed and lame) named Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) whom he mockingly dismisses. Little does Tony know that Killian is looking to finance his new start-up Extremis which can ""hack into the hard drive of any living organism"" and change its DNA. When those organisms are human beings this means that they glow orange like jack-o-lanterns and shoot lasers from their fingers.Jump to the present when Tony is suffering from anxiety insomnia in the aftermath of last years The Avengers in which superheroes and gods had a set-to. Though still equipped with his armour of wit as well as a series of experimental metal exoskeletons Tony works late in the night in his Malibu lab. Busy developing a team of Iron Man robots Tony pays even less attention than usual to his girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) in the same flirty if heatless relationship.Soon Iron Mans government calls on him again for help. A new bad guy is on the loose an Osama bin Laden-like America-hater named The Mandarin (the original comic book character was Chinese) who hijacks the airwaves to boast about his past and upcoming attacks. The Mandarin speaks in a broad American accent punching the rs in an exaggerated fashion that at first sounds like bad acting but turns out to be a clue to his secret identity.When The Mandarins henchmen blow up part of Hollywoods Chinese Theatre he leaves Starks security chief (Jon Favreau) near dead leading Iron Man to personally challenge the villain to a mano-a-mano battle. Though Black avoids the self-important seriousness of the Spider-Man/Dark Knight franchises he mixes his jokes with some old-fashioned sentimentality. After The Mandarin chases Tony out of his Malibu digs the stranded superhero finds himself just before Christmas hiding out in rural Tennessee where he bonds with a misfit fatherless kid (Ty Simpkins). This is straight out of Blacks Last Action Hero.Other elements of the script feel barely sketched in. The villains motives remain murky. Theres little effort to make the technology sound plausible while the glowing-fingered soldiers feel left over from a no-budget sixties sci-fi movie. Mostly though Black papers over plot holes with constant self-referential quips and a few set-piece stunts including a discomfiting sequence in which passengers free-fall from Air Force One.Otherwise IM3 feels as though it has been put through a script echo machine. Every major character seems to be equipped with a double identity at some point and Tony tends to keep a kind of play-by-play commentary on his own performance (""Its moments like these when I realize what a superhero I really am"").Numerous characters get a chance to don his Iron Man suit - from Pepper Potts to Colonel James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) to the kidnapped President. Theres even an army of robotic Iron Men on standby underscoring the assembly-line nature of these kinds of sequels.Of course clever is better than its opposite and Blacks stamp along with Downeys rakish louche style are fun for a while - but there is little room for emotional engagement or the illusion that any of the characters are in jeopardy no matter how many objects are exploding. After a while the steady diet of tongue-in-cheek starts to taste monotonous as day-old gum.

Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com5/2/2013 Editor rating 2.5 At the start of Iron Man 3 the usually loquacious billionaire Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is off his game. Having learned of the existence of aliens and alternate universes in The Avengers Stark is suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome. Hes had his mind blown and hes having trouble readjusting. For Christmas he buys his girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) a stuffed rabbit the size of a small building. When a terrorist known as The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) starts making threats on live TV and blowing up bombs Stark gives his home address to a news crew and challenges the villain to attack him -- which he does. The helicopter raid on Starks Malibu pad gives Iron Man 3 its first action setpiece and proves that Shane Black who had previously directed only one movie (2005s spiky comedy Kiss Kiss Bang Bang also starring Downey) knows how to play with big toys. Black who became famous (and extremely rich) in the 1980s for writing the Lethal Weapon series and other buddy-cop movies proves surprisingly adept at giant-scale moviemaking. In one terrific sequence 12 people fall out of a plane and Stark wearing his armor can carry only four. Whats a hero to do? Iron Man 3 could have used more dilemmas like that one investing the action with something other than just spectacle. There are wafer-thin characters such as the villainous entrepreneur (Guy Pearce) and the biologist (Rebecca Hall) who have created an army of super-soldiers. There isnt enough of Don Cheadle as Starks fellow do-gooder War Machine and there are way too many Iron Man suits flying around by themselves. If they no longer need to be navigated by a person then why does Stark ever bother to risk his life and put it on? The logic may not hold together but Iron Man 3 is going to be huge anyway and the reason is Downey. Black blends the perfect amount of tartness and wit into the actors dialogue so scenes that you would normally wish you could skip over are great fun to savor such as a long interlude in Tennessee where a helpless Stark relies on a 10-year-old boy who wants to know more about the Avengers. Just like he does with those crummy Sherlock Holmes movies Downey elevates this rather flimsy material with his sheer presence Is there any other actor working in movies right now who is as much fun to simply listen to? Iron Man 3 ends with a surprisingly generic showdown at a shipyard with cranes and explosions and fake-out deaths but it doesnt send you home irritated and empty like Iron Man 2 did. Marvel Studios will only be able to draw from this well only so many times though before fatigue sets in.

Grade C+ The ads read ""Iron Man 3"" but the end credits say ""Iron Man Three"" - the perfect capper for a movie that tries to spell everything out. Why is Tony Stark working for 72-hour stretches without sleep? Hell tell you in dialogue or voice-over. Hes haunted by the Avengers apocalyptic showdown with aliens in New York City. Hes still experiencing psychic bends because of his change from playboy genius to committed good guy and stalwart lover of Stark Industries new CEO Pepper Potts. Every time he switches on the TV he sees another horrifying video message from the Mandarin a madman with a ZZ Top beard an all-purpose Oriental costume and a voice that sounds as if hes narrating an expose on ""60 Minutes."" The Mandarin takes credit for multiple terrorist conflagrations and vows to defeat America and its heroes including Tony Stark. No wonder Stark starts having anxiety attacks. The moviemakers are really the ones getting anxiety attacks - over how to keep a towering comic-book franchise fresh. After a promising opening stretch they overstuff the movie with explosions hairpin plot turns and forced or arbitrary character reversals. The showdowns between Iron Man and biotech-created super-soldiers become monotonous even if these new enemies have nifty powers. (Theyre strong and fast their flesh is more resilient than robot armor and they can breathe fire and melt metal with their hands.) The script by director Shane Black and Drew Pearce lacks the connective tissue it needs to be a ripping yarn. Stark sets the main action in motion with a move so stupid that the film never recovers. On TV he dares the Mandarin to come out and fight then gives his Malibu address. Its astonishing that Stark has no battle plan when hes attacked there the next day. The movie is strewn with grandiose strokes that go nowhere or stock sequences gussied up with special effects. The matchup of two small super-armies provides an ""Oh this again"" kind of climax. It doesnt help that director Black has no gift for staging action - he cant achieve suspense because he doesnt give his set pieces a driving logic. When you want a visceral lift you get a hardware show. It doesnt help that screenwriter Black withholds information about Starks latest tinkering so when his newest creations are fully revealed theyre literally a group deus ex machina. How can a movie with such a smart hero be so dumb? After all Downey hasnt lost a step in his sauntering man-about-town gait or a millisecond of his spot-on comedy timing. He told Jon Stewart on Tuesday night that fans love for Iron Man made him feel ""like a Beatle."" In ""Iron Man 3"" he looks like hes in the middle of an endless hard days night. Insomnia unleashes his fear that he cant protect the woman he loves. Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow) who now lives with him may think hes obsessed with his various new models of remote-controlled Iron Men. But Downey conveys the bedrock commitment to their life together as well as the angst that fuels his nonstop puttering. In the thick of the numbskull action Downey finds ways to surprise you. You groan when Tony partners up with a helpful youngun in Tennessee named Harley (Ty Simpkins). But Downey mocks the cornball conventions of superheroes and youthful sidekicks. The kid plays right along even when Stark briskly tells the fatherless boy ""Dads leave"" adding that theres no need to be a sap about it. The way Downey plays him Stark handles the obligations of being a celebrity/superhero by refusing to fake emotions. Downeys talent ups the game of everyone who acts beside him. In an introductory flashback at a 1999 tech conference in Switzerland Rebecca Hall is even more smart-girl-sexy than usual as Maya a biotech pioneer whos also a saucy one-night stand. Guy Pearce goes from geeky caricature to walking GQ ad as Aldrich Killian the nerd who weaponizes Mayas research. Ben Kingsley taps into his inner Peter Sellers as the Mandarin He gets to be spooky and funny. Sadly their characters run into dead ends. That goes for ""Iron Man"" regulars too. Downeys hyperactivity and Paltrows calm elegance are so well matched that you hope theyll have more of a chance to perform as a team which doesnt happen much until the very end. Jon Favreau (who directed the first two ""Iron Man"" movies) is uproarious as Happy Hogan Starks best friend and former bodyguard now the head of security for Stark Industries. He makes his loyalty and need for friendship earthy-funny and noble - before he winds up unconscious in a hospital bed. At least Don Cheadle comes into his own as Colonel James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes/Iron Patriot (formerly War Machine). Hes learned how to undercut Tonys stream-of-consciousness rants with his own pinpoint understatement. Hes turned into a stealth comedian. Keep watching until after the last credit and youll see Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/the Hulk trying to play shrink to Tony Stark. Downey with Ruffalos help sends up Starks overblown talk about creating his own demons. As these actors go about their blissfully irreverent raillery the movies clanging and shouting float out of your head. You bask in the pleasure of seeing gifted performers at play. Ruffalos Banner/Hulk cant keep awake. After 2 hours and 10 minutes you know how he feels.

"Review Iron Man 3 smartly reboots the suit midflight - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Iron Man 3 smartly reboots the suit midflight Iron Man 3 Movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews Iron Man 3. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews Iron Man 3. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Batmans done it. Spider-Man too. Superman is about to try. As studios attempt to inject new life into overly familiar comic-book franchises reboots -- with changes in tone directors and stars -- are all the rage. But ""Iron Man 3"" proves there is more than one way to skin this particular cat.The story of ""Iron Man 3"" is a continuation of the previous two films and its key cast is the same. But like a stunt driver taking over the wheel while the car is moving at 100 mph new director (and co-writer) Shane Black has managed to change this billion-dollar-plus franchises tone for the better while keeping the same actor as Tony Stark. Call it a spiritual reboot. That nifty maneuver was a bit easier than it sounds because Black has a history with star Robert Downey Jr. The two worked together on 2005s cult favorite private-eye film ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" with the actor clearly enjoying himself back then with Blacks unmistakable style of oddball hyper-verbal dialogue that has since become something of a trademark for the actor.PHOTOS Iron Man 3 premiere There is quite a bit of Blacks trademark attitude and humor here as well things like a throwaway reference to the sci-fi classic ""Westworld"" and a goofy character who has Tony Starks likeness tattooed on his forearm. Black and company throw all kinds of stuff at the audience and though it doesnt all work a lot of it does and the attempt to be different and create unguessable twists is always appreciated.The most interesting thing about this new ""Iron Man"" is that far from being slicker than the first two versions it is unexpectedly -- and successfully -- darker and more serious than its predecessors with a cast including top actors like Guy Pearce Ben Kingsley and Rebecca Hall.With former director Jon Favreau reduced to his acting role as Happy Hogan now the obsessive head of security for Stark Industries this latest ""Iron Man"" (co-written by Drew Pearce) has thankfully done away with most of the previous installments tone-deaf repartee between Stark and Gwyneth Paltrows indispensable (to him at least) Pepper Potts.Pepper now in charge of Stark Industries is in residence at Starks Malibu compound and sharing his life though the man himself is far from his former carefree self. Skittish uneasy unable to sleep and given to compulsively building one high-maintenance Iron Man suit after another Stark is still dealing with the anxiety attack aftereffects of fighting off all those aliens in last summers ""The Avengers"" a movie which ""Iron Man"" blithely assumes everyone on the planet has seen (which may in fact be true). PHOTOS Shane Black From Lethal Weapon to Iron Man 3Looking older and unsettled and lacking his usual self-confidence Downeys still winningly charismatic Stark starts things off by taking us back in time to a scientific conference he attended in Switzerland in 1999 where his cocky pre-anxiety self needlessly created enemies and alienated potential friends.Stark was immediately attracted to scientist Maya Hanson (the always effective Hall) whom he snarkily describes as ""the most gifted woman Ive ever met ... in Switzerland."" Maya has found a way to get plants to regenerate themselves though their tendency to explode in the process is admittedly worrisome.The billionaire philanthropist isnt quite so enamored of Aldrich Killian (Pearce) another (albeit geekier) scientist. He blows off the young man which turns out not to be the best idea he ever had.These flashback introductions taken care of Stark returns to the present where his manic state is intensified by the televised manifestoes of the Mandarin a ruthless international terrorist convincingly played by Kingsley complete with Asian topknot and untraceable accent a role that takes full advantage of the dark side credentials the actor established in ""Sexy Beast."" The film also raises some intriguing questions about how we as a society have a hand in creating our own enemies our own demons.PHOTOS Summer Movie SneaksIts not just Kingsley who is effectively villainous. The film has given him a pair of expertly evil confederates in Eric Savin (James Badge Dale the gaunt cancer patient in ""Flight"") and Brandt (Stephanie Szostak). On the other side Stark ally Col. James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) has been rebranded from ""War Machine"" to ""Iron Patriot"" by an image-conscious focus group.Meanwhile Killian geeky no more presents himself to Pepper as the head of an organization called Advanced Idea Mechanics that is seeking funding for a technology he calls Extremis which will in effect create invulnerability by allowing the body to heal itself. Pepper always a worrier is concerned what would happen if this kind of revolutionary technology fell into the wrong hands but Killian tells her not to be concerned. As if all this werent head-spinning enough Stark manages to focus the Mandarins omni-directional hostility toward himself personally with catastrophic results. Which leads to the question is Iron Man still Iron Man if he has to fight evil without the help of his suits?Because it is finally a comic-book superhero movie ""Iron Man 3"" does tend to fall back on massive explosions and action set pieces as the conclusion nears. But by even posing questions of identity the film creates the kind of jeopardy we can believe in and for a superhero movie that is an accomplishment in and of itself. kenneth.turanlatimes.com-------------Iron Man 3MPAA rating PG-13 for sequences of intense sci-fi action and violence throughout and brief suggestive contentRunning time 2 hours 10 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Action (Movie Genre) Movies Entertainment Iron Man 3 (movie) Science Iron Man (movie) Robert Downey Jr. Iron Man 3 Premiere Hollywood bets big on blockbusters starting with Iron Man 3 Shane Black From Lethal Weapon to Iron Man 3 Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad81deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-iron-man-3-review-20130503,0,1671494.story",200,ironman310,ironman3,latimes

Marvel hide caption toggle caption Marvel Iron Man 3 Director Shane Black Genre Action Adventure Sci-Fi Running Time 130 minutes Rated PG-13 for sequences of intense sci-fi action and violence throughout and brief suggestive content With Robert Downey Jr. Gwyneth Paltrow Ben Kingsley Don Cheadle Guy Pearce Rebecca Hall Jon Favreau Paul Bettany James Badge Dale Yknow I think this bummed-out superhero thing is catching. Depressed Bat-guy brooding Spider-dude even the Man of Steel seems existentially troubled in previews of his most recent incarnation. And smart-alecky Iron Man? Hed appeared inoculated by Tony Starks reflexive snark from succumbing to a similar ailment -- but even hes having anxiety attacks these days. Ever since that Avengers dust-up with those unpleasant aliens last summer hes evidently been having trouble sleeping. And now with his super-buddies occupied elsewhere our hero is on his own when a pontificating bad guy (Ben Kingsley) surfaces all ornate robes and dirty hair and pretentious Asian-inspired name with a retinue of suicide bombers and an affect that suggests he wants to be thought of as Osama bin Mandarin. When his minions lay waste to a public square blowing up a lot of innocent civilians -- similarities to Boston presumably not intended but hard to ignore -- Starks reaction is to issue an ""If youre a man youll come after me Ill leave the door unlocked"" dare through the press. Complete with his address. (Not perhaps the wisest move a sleep-deprived trigger-happy billionaire who wants to protect his girlfriend could do.) Happily Starks been working on a nifty new Iron Man app that lets him bond with his body armor one kneepad at a time. There are still a few kinks -- as the pieces careen his way it looks like hes under attack and until theyre all synched up he cant fly -- but his artificially intelligent pal Jarvis (voiced by Paul Bettany) is good at working them out in real time. For a while at least. Robert Downey Jr. has always put a youre-not-the-boss-of-me adolescent spin on Stark so its fun that Iron Man 3 gives him an actual adolescent to play against a lonely kid named Harley (Ty Simpkins) who finds a low-energy beat-up Iron Man in his garage and treats him a lot like Elliott treated E.T. Im gonna guess that was new writer-director Shane Blacks idea; hes the guy who revitalized action movies a couple of decades ago with his script for Lethal Weapon and who more recently revitalized Downeys career with Kiss Kiss Bang Bang so its reasonable that Downey wanted him around. His recipe here is similar -- snappy dialogue momentarily startling plot twists and lots of stuff blowing up. Stark spars amiably with Don Cheadles earnest Col. Rhodes puffs out his chest with Guy Pearces villainous entrepreneur Aldrich Killian and jousts puckishly with a freshly feisty Pepper Potts. And with all those heavyweights on hand it makes sense that the film makes much of character-based surprises -- who knew Gwyneth Paltrows Potts spent so much time at the gym for instance? It also has -- and I dont think this will qualify as a spoiler -- an entirely conventional blow-everything-to-smithereens conclusion. Looks like a fireworks display it does which is either Stark-scale hubris or merely appropriate for an early-May release that has every intention of hanging around theaters until the Fourth of July.

Starring Robert Downey Jr. Gwyneth Paltrow Don Cheadle Jon Favreau Guy Pearce Rebecca Hall Stephanie Szostak James Badge Dale Ben Kingsley Director Shane Black Running time 209 Release Opened May 3 2013  Editorial Review An Avenger coasts out WestBy Ann HornadayFriday May 3 2013In his recent keynote address at the San Francisco International Film Festival during which he consigned most of modern filmmaking to a dust--heap of once--shiny detritus and disposable trash Steven Soderbergh made a keenly observed distinction between movies and cinema noting that ""a movie is something you see and cinema is something thats made."" Its difficult to see how that pithily elegant rubric might accommodate ""Iron Man 3"" which seems designed less as an artisanal object or visual entertainment than a full--body assault on the senses. A frantic occasionally funny finally enervating bricolage of special effects explosive set pieces sardonic one--liners and notional human emotions this branch of the Marvel franchise tree feels brittle and over--extended enough to snap off entirely. From its anxious protagonist and the battered metal sheaths he dons to save the world to the clattering fiery mayhem that ensues with metronomic predictability ""Iron Man 3"" is less a movie than a final war whoop let loose before utter exhaustion sets in. Which isnt to say that this installment doesnt have its moments. Taking the reins from series director Jon Favreau Shane Black has enlisted a fine ensemble to bring a beloved chapter of Tony Starks saga to life including a crafty Ben Kingsley as villain--du--jour the Mandarin. After a prologue in which Tony meets scientists Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall) and Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) in Switzerland the story catches up with our playboy--inventor--superhero in the present day shortly after he has lit up New York with the rest of his Marvel brothers in ""The Avengers."" Plagued by his brush with death Tony cant sleep and nearly every encounter with a fan or mention of ""New York"" sends him into paroxysms of anxiety. Having met Norse gods and touched the Big Nothing he worries ""Im just a man in a can."" Robert Downey Jr. plays the existential angst the way he plays all of Tonys feelings in ""Iron Man 3"" with a glib whip--crack off--handedness that would have been at home in a 1940s screwball comedy and that has helped levitate the ""Iron Man"" series from being a mere exercise in CGI bombast and macho over--compensation. His banter with computer--valet Jarvis (delightfully voiced by Paul Bettany) as well as with body man Happy Hogan (Favreau) love interest Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and the various fans he encounters on his travels accounts for most of the laughs in ""Iron Man 3"" which will take Tony from his post--modern Malibu aerie to Tennessee and Florida. Some of the pictures best moments transpire between Tony and a young boy named Harley (Ty Simpkins) who helps his hero with a digital Dora watch and some spare parts from his potato gun. One of the big draws of ""Iron Man 3"" is seeing how Tony will deploy the band of ""brobots"" he has been building in his workshop in Malibu. He and his cohorts -- including Col. James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) -- slip in and out of so many aerodynamic sarcophagi that ""Iron Man 3"" begins to take on the contours of ""Attack of the Clones"" (with all the unfortunate associations such a comparison suggests). After a frenetic attack on Tonys Malibu dream house the decimation of downtown Los Angeles by a pack of molten--skinned bad guys and a daring mid--air rescue theres nowhere to go but bigger and louder. The great danger of ""Iron Man"" has always been that it winds up looking and sounding like ""Transformers"" as those metallic body--pods hurl themselves at Tony with punishing ballistic force. This iteration is no different even though its not just Tony who turns into a knight in clanking occasionally malfunctioning armor. The occasional twists notwithstanding ""Iron Man 3"" doesnt pack much by way of surprise or invention. Presumably it will still satisfy what the audience has come to expect from the series (""Iron Man 3"" already has cleared 240 million overseas). But especially after the bright lively ""Avengers"" last summer it feels murky and draggy all the more so for 3--D photography that saps its crowded busy images of dynamic range. At one point Tony presents Pepper with a Christmas gift of a huge goofy overstuffed rabbit ---- a seemingly obvious Trojan Bunny that winds up having no narrative function whatsoever. Sometimes a huge goofy overstuffed rabbit is just a huge goofy overstuffed rabbit ---- and even a huge goofy overstuffed rabbit can get a little threadbare. ""Iron Man 3"" ends with a tone of finality which even if its ersatz feels like a well--earned respite. It seems only fair to let the man in the can rest in peace at least for now.Contains sequences of intense sci-fi action and violence throughout and for brief suggestive content.

When Tony Starks world is torn apart by a formidable terrorist called the Mandarin Stark starts an odyssey of rebuilding and retribution. (Photo/Video Disney) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com May 2 2013 551 p.m. ET The suits have taken over the franchise. Not the corporate suits though ""Iron Man 3"" is so incoherent that it might have been written by a particularly quarrelsome committee but the robotic suits. The movie is obsessed by them. Tony Stark the supersmart industrialist played once again by Robert Downey Jr. has his Mark 42 suit which comes when he calls it piece by piece anywhere in the world. Tonys friend Col. James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes (Don Cheadle) has his Iron Patriot suit which is a War Machine suit with upgrades and fresh paint. Theres a point to this sartorial tech. Tony himself is obsessed by the suits so he keeps building new ones. They give him a sense of security and promise relief from the anxiety attacks he has been having since his near-disaster at the end of ""The Avengers"" last year. But the third iteration of a franchise that began so well becomes a hollow hymn to martial gadgetry. The suits and story clank in unison. Thats not to deny the distinctions of this huge production which was directed by Shane Black. The computer animation is often astonishing even if the 3-D is indifferent and explosions are explosions no matter whats being exploded. (Tonys cliff-clinging house in Malibu is reduced to rubble after he gives out his street address on national television.) ""Iron Man 3"" is not just a summer Blockbuster it is also a advertising behemoth. From cars to sandwiches here are a few of the ads to feature Tony Starks alter ego. The films greatest distinction is the spin it puts on its villainy which involves not only Guy Pearce as the malevolent entrepreneur Aldrich Killian but Ben Kingsley as The Mandarin an arch-villain unlike any other. To explain why hes unlike any other would spoil one of the few good surprises in the script which was written by Drew Pearce and the director. Lets just say that Mr. Kingsley or Sir Ben if you will makes The Mandarin both frightening and terrifically funny--Tony refers to the character as Sir Laurence Oblivion--and that the surprise is both enjoyable and oddly damaging to a dramatic structure that doesnt need additional hollowness. Seeing ""Iron Man 3"" this weekend with a friend girlfriend or boyfriend? Have absolutely no idea who Tony Stark is? What a War Machine is? Fear not Heres WSJs cheat sheet with everything you need to know. In the first ""Iron Man"" Mr. Downey was the only funnyman. He was funny in a way that superheroes had never been--hip droll sardonic and self-ironic--and his quick wit meshed beautifully with the movies sophisticated style and elegant action. This time he settles for nervous and flip. He gets his laughs but Tonys self-irony has been replaced by the stars self-comment and it doesnt help that the writing often depends on glib banter the most conspicuous example of which is an extended set piece in small-town Tennessee. Finding himself there in extremis Tony collaborates with a precocious little kid named Harley--hes played by Ty Simpkins--to produce a jury-rigged piece of equipment like the one E.T. used to call home. (When a massive explosion takes down the towns water tower you watch with interest though without feeling since all of the previous massive explosions have functioned like Novocain leaving you prenumbed.) Extremis is also the name of a bioenhancement process that turns some of the movies humans into turbocharged heavies who glow with evil energy and look like zombies. Theres no lack of energy throughout even if much of it like the acting feels forced. ( Gwyneth Paltrow who is back as Pepper Potts has lost her cool but gained her own robotics and her own action sequence which ends with casually absurd illogic. Rebecca Hall a superb actress in normal circumstances seems uncomfortable as Dr. Maya Hansen whos responsible for the invention of Extremis and for its fateful flaw.) ""Iron Man 3"" is an industrial enterprise fabricated for kids and they will eat it up just as eagerly as the Iron Giant scarfed scrap metal. If youre not a kid though or if you want to keep your memories of the first ""Iron Man"" unsullied beware of the buzz and hubbub and the glowing reviews. You know the story of the emperors new suit. Scatter My Ashes at Bergdorfs Watch a clip from the film ""Scatter My Ashes at Bergdorfs"" a documentary on the Manhattan department store with interviews from an array of fashion designers style icons and celebrities. (Photo/Video Entertainment One) The energy in ""Scatter My Ashes at Bergdorfs""--what a great title--is genuine infectious and superabundant. Everyone under the fashion sun must have wanted to talk to Matthew Mieles camera about the 111-year-old institution that fills a whole side of Fifth Avenue between 57th and 58th streets. (The title comes from a classic New Yorker cartoon by Victoria Roberts.) The production notes claim the film contains 175 interviews. I didnt count them but I enjoyed almost every one of them from the straight-faced declaration by the producer Jean Doumanian that ""stores like this are necessary to make people aspire to something better"" to the flat assertion by the designer Isaac Mizrahi that ""if your clothes are not at that place then they have no future."" ENLARGE David Hoey Entertainment One Films That place was built on the site of the Vanderbilt mansion in 1928 by Edwin Goodman--co-founder Herbert Bergdorf had sold out in 1906--who with his wife Belle lived above the store in a 16-room penthouse. (To circumvent the building code they listed themselves as janitors.) Now that place is where a pair of glittery high-heeled shoes goes for 6000 (a salesman describes the reliable seller as ""sexy Dorothy""); where enterprising sales people can earn 500000 a year; where Elizabeth Taylor once came in to buy 200 pairs of mink earmuffs to give as gifts and where an apparent bag lady paid cash for a sable coat. Mr. Mieles documentary is of course an elaborate commercial for the store. Yet its also a slice of New York history or a whole layer cake of slices with celebrities for icing; the film ends with Barbra Streisand singing and dancing her way through Bergdorfs in the course of her singular 1965 TV special ""My Name Is Barbra."" The most interesting participants though are the men and women who choose the merchandise and make the place work. They include Bergdorfs fashion director Linda Fargo (though shes sometimes mistaken for Vogues editor Anna Wintour she navigates her world in a friendly fashion without dark glasses or security troops); the relentlessly candid personal shopper Betty Halbreich (""What do you think youd be doing if you werent doing this?"" she is asked. ""Drinking"" she answers); and the stores window designer David Hoey who takes a wonderfully no-nonsense approach to the task of creating near-hallucinatory productions that amount in his phrase to ""frozen-in-time"" movies. ""You have to be very highbrow and silly at the same time"" he says ""so everyone will enjoy it."" --J.M. Love Is All You Need Watch a clip from the film ""Love Is All You Need."" A hairdresser who has lost her hair to cancer finds out her husband is having an affair travels to Italy and meets a man who blames the world for his wifes death. (Photo/Video Sony) In the very first scene of ""Love Is All You Need"" the Danish filmmaker Susanne Bier and her writing collaborator Anders Thomas Jensen put some of their cards on the table. The heroine a Copenhagen hairdresser named Ida (Trine Dyrholm) has been diagnosed with breast cancer and her future is in doubt. Thats only part of the premise though. The other part is romance or the possibility of romance between Ida whose oafish husband has just left her for a younger woman and Philip ( Pierce Brosnan) an English widower living a lonely embittered life in Denmark. The script suffers from a surfeit of contrivance even before Ida and Philip travel to Italy for the wedding of her daughter and his son. Once the setting shifts romance and family dysfunction are equally in the air and theres a lot for everyone to work through. (Paprika Steen stops the show as Philips volcanic sister-in-law.) Whats remarkable though is how Ms. Biers film in Danish and English finds beauty in its quiet moments which are many and close between. ENLARGE Pierce Brosnan and Trine Dyrholm Sony Pictures Classics In one of them Philip recounts to Ida the random accident that took his wifes life. In another a tender moment between them his cellphone rings he acknowledges his love for Ida by tossing the phone into the ocean and she says with sweet astonishment ""Why did you do that?"" Mr. Brosnans skill goes a long way toward overcoming the rigidities written into his role; hes an awful grump until he becomes warm and appealing. Ms. Dyrholm is another story in all phases of the tale. Her Ida is touching without effort and comically childlike in a way that recalls Giuliettta Massina. She has a gift for love. --J.M. DVD Focus ENLARGE Sexy Beast (2000) Ben Kingsleys thug Don Logan is a portrait of chilling perversity in Jonathan Glazers noirish thriller which was written by Louis Mellis and David Scinto. The film is set on Spains Costa del Sol and in London. Ray Winstones Gal Dove a happily retired English crook is confronted by Logan who wants to draft him for a bank heist. Dove accuses his unwelcome visitor of ""insinuendos."" There arent many insinuendos in the movie. Its appeal lies on the bright shiny surface of its ostensibly simple plot and in its rat-a-tat-tat language which often sounds like Mamet-visits-Spyne. ENLARGE Unzipped (1995) Isaac Mizrahi is the subject of Douglas Keeves exhilarating documentary which tracks the designer through one turbulent season--from early days in which he gropes for fleetingly glimpses grasps at verbalizes hyperverbalizes joyously sketches briefly fears and finally embraces a new concept to the do-or-die day when he presents his new collection in the eye of the hurricane that is New Yorks fashion industry. ""Unzipped"" shows how a top-flight practitioner of an ephemeral art can take the most unlikely odds and ends from the remnant shop of popular culture and turn them into something daringly new. ENLARGE Open Hearts (2002) Susanne Biers drama written by Anders Thomas Jensen turns on a terrible accident that renders a man quadriplegic. Straightforward in form but surprisingly intricate its about successive accidents of the heart that follow a random catastrophe on a city street and that test the inner strength of two men as well as a desperate young woman. The victim Joachim is played by Nikolaj Lie Kaas with shocking ferocity. In a film that seems more discovered than invented blameless people are caught unprepared by circumstances that no one could prepare for. Then theyre blindsided by love. --J.M.

Flashy and frivolous an exhibitionist who likes the glare of public attention hes a light knight with a thick skin. Traditionally protagonists are punished for their hubris and the first ""Iron Man"" movie went through those motions. But Downey enjoys Starks arrogance too much to eat humble pie. Hes always resisted the idea of playing the repentant. Stark may have developed a conscience after his run-in with the Taliban in the first movie and even turned monogamous for Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow) but hes still a flip cynical hedonist at heart. So what are we to make of the anxiety attacks that cripple Mr. Stark in Shane Blacks ""Iron Man 3""? Apparently hes freaked out after his mind-blowing experiences with ""The Avengers"" last summer (though no one else seems concerned that Norse gods are at large in the cosmos and when the going gets tough you do wonder why he doesnt pick up the phone and ask his new buddies for help -- not the only plot hole by any means). Black who wrote ""Lethal Weapon"" way back when and more recently helped restore Downeys career with ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" may have hoped that a sliver of self-doubt would crack open Iron Mans emotional armor and restore the human face behind the mask but Downey shows no interest in introspection. JUST WATCHEDRobert Downey Jr. talks Iron Man 3ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRobert Downey Jr. talks Iron Man 3 0138Black systematically strips Tony of almost everything he has -- gadgets gizmos his strongest suit -- but the actor merely shrugs it off. Theres a lot of faulty wiring this time round technology that seems as flawed as its inventor but if his problems are largely of his own making Tony remains supremely unfazed always primed with a quip and a smirk. Downey may as well be playing ""Irony Man.""JUST WATCHEDStan Lee I would be this superheroReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHStan Lee I would be this superhero 0105Starks arrogance and narcissism come back to haunt him in the form of spurned entrepreneur Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) and a larger-than-life terror-monger by the name of ""The Mandarin"" (Ben Kingsley). A cross between Osama bin Laden and Fu Manchu -- but with the rumbling tumbling vocal stylings of a Southern Baptist evangelist The Mandarin brings out the best in Kingsley who hasnt had a role as juicy as this one for donkeys years. Mandarin is a worthy nemesis an extravagant showman like Tony who can hack into broadcast feeds at will and claims credit for a string of bombings across the U.S. When Hap (Jon Favreau) is caught in one blast Tony takes it as a personal affront -- and impetuously calls fire down on his own head. Theres an off-the-cuff quality to the storytelling here -- the movie rewrites its own laws of physics whenever its convenient to do so -- which by rights should be a bigger problem than it is. But Black and/or co-writer Drew Pearce know how to write snappy dialogue. Even if they dont mean a thing their scenes have plenty of zing. They also have an ace up their sleeve a trump card that puts a giddy spin on the third act at just that point where both the previous movies began to run out of stream. To say more would be to spoil the fun. ""Iron Man 3"" has plenty to offer on that score. Its a confidently tongue-in-cheek piece of blockbuster engineering sweetly calibrated to Downeys cavalier appeal and to Kingsleys oddball interjections a battle royale of rampant egos in which acting speaks louder than words.Powered by LivefyreHomeU.S.Crime + JusticeEnergy + EnvironmentExtreme WeatherSpace + ScienceWorldAfricaAmericasAsiaEuropeMiddle East2016 ElectionWashingtonNationWorldMarketsTechMediaPersonal FinanceLuxuryOpinionPolitical Op-EdsSocial CommentaryHealthDiet + FitnessLiving WellParenting + FamilyEntertainmentCelebrity WatchTV + WebMovies + MusicTechGadgetsCyber SecurityInnovation NationFashionDesignArchitectureAutosLuxuryTravelBest of TravelSleeps + EatsBusiness TravelAviation + BeyondPro FootballCollege FootballBasketballBaseballSoccerLivingFoodRelationshipsReligionVideoLive TV Digital StudiosCNN FilmsTV ScheduleTV Shows A-ZMore...PhotosLongformInvestigationsiReportCNN profilesCNN LeadershipCNN NewslettersU.S. EditionSet edition preferenceU.S.InternationalConfirmU.S.InternationalArabicEspanol(c) 2016 Cable News Network.

Slideshow Iron Man 3 Lots of action as Tony Stark proves himself again Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon Video Trailer Iron Man 3 More about Iron Man 3 >> And now in Iron Man 3 - after two Iron Mans and The Avengers - Robert Downey Jr.s billionaire industrialist a.k.a. the ""man in a can"" seems on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Sleep-deprived and prone to panic attacks Stark is spending most of his time tinkering with his collection of armored Iron Men - loads of them each more advanced than the last. He seems closer with Jarvis the disembodied A.I. voice (courtesy of Paul Bettany) that oversees Starks computers than he does with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) his live-in girlfriend and CEO of Stark Industries. And then a guy with a pronounced bin Laden vibe - not to mention a bin Laden beard - hacks into the TV networks with viral videos of bombings and assassinations. ""Some people call me a terrorist"" the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) observes in preacher-like intonations eyeballing the camera. ""I consider myself a teacher."" And then the teacher takes credit for a deadly attack on Hollywood Boulevards famed Chinese Theater. Is nothing sacred? Iron Man 3 directed by the 80s action screenwriter Shane Black (he also directed Downey in 2005s jaunty neo-noir Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) is a big kabooming sequel that plays sleight-of-hand with its audience. If the 1999 New Years Eve sequence that opens the film tells us anything - apart from Downeys rambling voice-over insights about how ""we create our own demons"" - its that you should never snub a misshapen supergenius when he asks to show you his plans for a human repair and growth formula. When Tony Stark doesnt keep his promise to meet an excited Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) on the rooftop of a Swiss hotel his fate - Tony Starks that is - is sealed. And so too in Iron Man 3 is the fate of the world. Not even the president is safe from the menace of the Mandarin. At one point its up to Iron Man to save 13 crew members sucked out of Air Force One at 30000 feet. Jarvis calculates that the best Iron Man can do is carry four to safety but that wont do. The alloy-plated hero with the thrusters and repulsors orchestrates a midair Barrel of Monkeys hookup bringing the plummetees to safety in Miami harbor. Its the most spectacular stunt of the film all the more so because it was (more or less) real. The climactic CGI stunts on a giant oil rig involving an army of flying Iron Men a phalanx of bad guys and Don Cheadle and Downey leaping from exploding catwalks pale by comparison. The action plays like a video game because well it may as well be. One of the prime conceits of Iron Man 3 is that Tony Stark must prove himself all over again. Starks gizmos have been taken away from him destroyed. Its a test can he still cut it without his technology his prehensile armor his GPS? His Eero Saarinen-like house on a Malibu bluff has been blown to smithereens and Stark blows across the States crash landing in a small Tennessee town on the trail of someone or something. A pip-squeak kid (Ty Simpkins) tries chasing an intruder out of his fathers shed only to discover that the intruder is Stark. Soon the boy Harley is helping the wiseguy inventor upload this and downlink that and amp up the whosie-whats-its. Its a veritable tech-nerd bonding moment. Rebecca Hall the British actress sparks things up as an old flame of Starks - or old one-night stand (his memory is kind of fuzzy). Peppers not sure what to make of this Dr. Maya Hansen a brilliant geneticist. Suffice to say things get a little tense between the two women. For about five seconds which is the average down time between explosions and aerial battle sequences in this overblown sequel. Jon Favreau who directed the very good Iron Man and the not-so-good Iron Man 2 returns to mere acting - reprising the role of Happy Hogan Starks bodyguard and chauffeur now the security chief for Stark Industries. Hogan has reason to worry but he also finds a reason to watch Downton Abbey on TV. Its Iron Man 3s saving grace It still knows how to be funny. But then the mayhem and the megalomaniacal villainy start again. Contact Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 sreaphillynews.com or follow on Twitter Steven_Rea.

There are several good supporting performances not even including Gwyneth Paltrows abdominal muscles which is really all I can remember about Pepper Potts Guy Pearce as a nerd genius spurned by Tony Stark years earlier who comes back for revenge; Ben Kingsley most delicious of all as a shadowy techno-Osama known as the Mandarin.One-time action-movie wunderkind Shane Black (of ""Lethal Weapon"" fame) who directed the film and co-wrote the screenplay with Drew Pearce strikes a tone of pseudo-edgy frat-boy black comedy thats so retro its almost charming. (This movie is simultaneously a conclusion and a comeback story; Black hasnt made anything in Hollywood since directing Downey in ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" in 2005.) Ludicrous and overblown as the whole thing is it comes with a half-convincing tone of elegy Memento mori dude All things must pass even idiotic but enjoyable action trilogies about a billionaire with a flying suit of armor. After its own weird Shane Black fashion ""Iron Man 3"" is a story about a boy growing into a man losing the bachelor pad and the sports car and becoming a husband and a father - though not necessarily in that order and with a whole bunch of chaotic ass-kicking to receive and administer along the way.On one hand story in a comic-book film is largely a pretext for showing off the technology and moving the characters into spectacular confrontations. On the other hand plot is a difficult thing to get right in a movie like this because it needs to employ familiar tropes - a hero a villain a globe-threatening crisis and a couple of unexpected switches - while not seeming entirely derivative. Black and Pearce get a solid B-plus here for Kingsleys mysterious Mandarin who looks vaguely Middle Eastern but talks with a possibly put-on down-home accent and hacks into cable TV transmissions anytime he wants to deliver his dire messages to the world. He has some revenge agenda directed at the sourpuss Republican-looking president played by William Sadler and one of the faintly seditious touches in Blacks work is that its nearly impossible to feel any sympathy for that guy. Then there are two figures out of Tony Starks past a cutting-edge brain researcher called Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) snubbed by Tony at a Y2K New Years Eve party and a long-ago ex-girlfriend played by Rebecca Hall who may never have gotten over him. You Might Also Like Throw in a series of bombing attacks in which no traces of actual bombs are ever found along with a dramatic helicopter attack on Starks Malibu clifftop home that nearly finishes off both Tony and Pepper - who still seem as throughout this series more like brother and sister than anything else - and were set up for a decent chase mystery. A small town in Tennessee is almost entirely destroyed in a showdown between Tony and a battalion of the Mandarins weaponized super-soldiers Iron Man has to save a dozen or so people as they plunge through space from an exploding airplane (OK its actually Air Force One) and almost everyone in the movie winds up aboard an oil tanker for a nonsensical last battle in which any connection to cinematic space and time is abandoned. Ive already been asked whether the PG-13 ""Iron Man 3"" is appropriate for younger kids. It depends on the kids of course but my hunch is that my 9-year-olds would find it incomprehensible both in tone and content and also excessively violent.While the airborne rescue may be the best action sequence in this trilogy (and the oil-tanker battle may be the worst) both Black and Downey are at their best when Tony is stranded in rural Tennessee at Christmastime with no working Iron Man suit forced to team up with a fatherless budding techno-prodigy of 9 or so (played by Ty Simpkins). ""Thats what dads do"" Tony tells the kid ""they leave. Theres no call to be a pussy about it."" But of course we understand that Tonys bionically altered heart has been touched by this kid who correctly diagnoses that Tony is suffering from a panic disorder and possible PTSD after those events in New York with the wormhole and the aliens and so on. That is I guess a reference to events in last summers huge hit ""The Avengers"" a movie I saw and wrote about but now can only barely remember even after reading a plot summary. Even if this movie marks the conclusion of the Iron Man franchise at least in this iteration we are assured at the end that ""Tony Stark will return"" no doubt in the ""Avengers"" sequel planned for the summer of 2015. And so the promised maturity of the comic-book universe remains theoretical somewhere beyond the distant horizon. It may be time for Tony Stark to grow up get help and move on but his fans dont have to. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

They soar through the sky in formation and attack at the whim of narcissistic superhero-inventor Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr. sharpening his snark to a fine point). They snap together and disassemble faster than you can say ""presold blockbuster."" One even executes a daring midair rescue and fools us into thinking someones actually inside.That sequence makes for a handy encapsulation of a movie that wears all of its macho charm and every thin plot twist on the surface. Its a slick enough surface shined up by director and co-writer Shane Black for maximum jocularity and digital razzle-dazzle. But every time you think Iron Man 3 might shoot for a touch of gravity -- and it frequently makes such feints -- youre reminded this franchise is engineered to float lightly if loudly above the ground.The conflicted Tony is both in sync and at war with Blacks signature melding of wit and violence a comfortably familiar combo that dates back to his screenplay for Lethal Weapon. Settled into his Malibu hideaway with the lovely and amusingly named Pepper Potts (erstwhile lifestyle guru Gwyneth Paltrow) Tony is suffering from panic attacks. The traumas of Marvels franchise beachhead The Avengers have for scarcely explained reasons left him shaken. Get this man a Paxil pronto.Or just let him keep spouting Blacks ever-ready quips saturated with more pop-culture references than the first two movies combined. Downton Abbey Dora the Explorer Bill Maher and Joan Rivers each get a moment to shine even as a generically mad villain (Guy Pearce) and a media-savvy terrorist (Ben Kingsley a surprise source of comic relief) scheme against the president (William Sadler) and plot other very bad things.The whole movie generates an air of blithe catastrophe and thorough lack of consequence. These qualities might collide with Iron Man 3s gestures toward recognizable human emotion but the movie is shrewd enough to skitter along so frenetically that nothing not even tonal contradiction can stick.It helps that Iron Man 3 is quite funny -- intentionally so I should add -- on a moment-to-moment basis. Stranded on a snowy small-town Tennessee night Tony befriends a cute little fatherless tyke (Ty Simpkins) and for an instant Iron Man 3 threatens to get precious. But thats not Blacks style. He lets Tony sass the kid and allows Downey to play to his comic strengths; the interlude plays like a junior varsity (and PG-13) take on Bad Santa.Iron Man 3 wants to have it both ways with throwaway escapism making room for the damaged superhero psyche. When it doubt however its happy to embrace the frivolous. As Tony and his military sidekick Col. Rhodes (Don Cheadle) swap wisecracks in the face of final-act disaster you half-expect one of them to mutter a Roger Murtaugh-Lethal Weapon crack about being too old for this.Tough luck fellas. With this guaranteed payday in the bank another sequel cant be far behind.Follow Chris Vognar on Twitter at chrisvognar.IRON MAN 3(B) Directed by Shane Black.

"Iron Man 3 a piping hot mess yes but also fun review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesIron Man 3 a piping hot mess yes but also fun reviewIron Man 3 may be ""a piping hot mess"" as Robert Downey Jr. says of his character but it has a few good twists and airborne monkeys to boot.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. May 2 2013Iron Man 3Starring Robert Downey Jr. Gwyneth Paltrow Guy Pearce Ben Kingsley Rebecca Hall Don Cheadle and Jon Favreau. Written and directed by Shane Black. 130 minutes. Opens May 3 at major theatres. PGDeck the halls with boughs of holly its time for another Iron Man movieWait a tic were in the season of summer blockbusters not feel-good Christmas ones. All the ho-ho-hoing in Iron Man 3 would normally indicate a movie held back from Yuletide release and not for reasons of merriment.Article Continued BelowExcept this ones by Shane Black a top Hollywood screenwriter turned writer/director. He blows hot (Lethal Weapon) and cold (Last Action Hero) and hes happiest when mixing metaphors as when he last teamed with Iron Mans Robert Downey Jr. for the clever crime satire Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. Their combustion this time produces what Downeys brainiac billionaire Tony Stark calls a ""piping hot mess."" Hes actually referring to himself warning his girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) who is also the head of Stark Industries that hes never going to be emotionally stable.But the phrase does double duty as an excellent descriptor for the movie a smoking heap of chuckles and knuckles set to the ring of ""Jingle Bells"" and the clang of iron suits and war machines. It gives you an idea of how Marvel Comics might handle a remake of Its a Wonderful Life.Speaking of dualities we have a nearly schizophrenic Stark suffering anxious flashbacks of last years The Avengers tussle (didnt the good guys win that one?) while at the same time cockily daring this years super villain a terrorist called the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) to bring it on GWB style.The taunt brings fire to Starks Malibu pad but lets not get ahead of ourselves. Iron Man 3 begins on New Years Eve 1999 as Stark meets two players who will later demonstrate what ""karma"" means sexy botanist Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall) and frantic nerd Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce).Jump to 2013 and Stark is dealing with as many challenges and threats as Black (and co-writer Drew Pearce) can stuff into their Plot-a-Matic machine which includes a fly-apart Iron Man outfit that acts as visual shorthand for Tonys fractured psyche.Hes as arrogant as ever but strangely reluctant to suit up even after the Mandarin embarks on a campaign of all-too-familiar global terror which includes blowing up tourists outside the former Graumans Chinese Theatre a Hollywood metaphor Im not gonna touch. At this point you may be asking yourself ""Where the heck are the Avengers?"" Thats also the query a pesky kid named Harley (Ty Simpkins) keeps asking Stark when the action shifts to Tennessee likely more for tax-deduction reasons than dramatic ones.Good question and we might also ask why Starks bodyguard Happy (Jon Favreau director of Iron Man and Iron Man 2) and his pal Col. Rhodes (Don Cheadle) seem curiously underwritten. And why does the Mandarin speak like a redneck American and why do those strange humanoid warriors yet another distraction keep bursting into flames? Its a lot to take in especially when the third act dissolves into a giant clanking and burning mass of metal mayhem and multiple Iron Man suits.We need to remind ourselves that this is a comic book movie where logic stops for popcorn and Twizzlers and that Black never has been one for genre consistency.On that basis Iron Man 3 offers a few twisted pleasures. Its funnier than Iron Man 2 (which wouldnt be hard) and Downey is in fine comic form especially when hes sparring with young Simpkins who thankfully throttles back on the precociousness.The other actors also get their moments especially Pearce and Kingsley who know how to slice the ham even while striking Shakespearian poses.And theres an airborne rescue that will be tough to beat for thrills this summer which will undoubtedly be referred to as the ""barrel of monkeys"" scene even though those ""monkeys"" are people.Yes all this and monkey business too.

Disney Marvel Studios AP AP AP AP Eric Charbonneau/Invision/AP Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP Iron Man 3 Director Shane Black Cast Robert Downey Jr. Gwyneth Paltrow Ben Kingsley Guy Pearce Rated PG-13 (intense sci-fi action and violence throughout brief suggestive content) Running time 130 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 1258pm on Thursday May. 02 2013 Thursday May. 02 2013 Thursday May. 02 2013 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram The loudest thing about Iron Man 3 isnt the constant boom of explosions the heavy barrage of bullets or even the impressive destruction of our heros magnificent mansion which ends up crumbling into the sea. Its the ka-ching of cash as this third installment in the popular Marvel Comics franchise even moreso than its predecessors seems meticulously crafted to be a box-office juggernaut.It deals with the big issue of the day -- terrorism -- and even has a cute kid.But Iron Man 3 manages to rise above its naked ambitions thanks to two things Robert Downey Jr.s sly charm in the role of the multibillionaire entrepreneur turned superhero and Ben Kingsleys too-short and ultimately hilarious turn as the villainous Mandarin a clever update on the comic-book character created in the 60s. If Iron Man 3 doesnt pack the surprise of the first Iron Man the presence of Kingsley alone puts it leagues ahead of Iron Man 2.This time around Tony Stark aka Ironman (Downey) finds his world torn apart by a man he once spurned a brilliant but mad scientist Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) whos bent on revenge. Thanks to work pioneered by Iron Mans friend Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall) he has found a way to instantly regrow tissue so limbs instantly reappear. Trouble is the side effects are rather explosive.Combine that with the threat posed by the Osama bin Laden-like Mandarin whos threatening to take America down and youve got a job fit for Iron Man and his plucky girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) who gets to display some superhero moves of her own. It doesnt help though that Stark is plagued by anxiety attacks from his previous missions and this is where the cute kid -- Harley Keener (Ty Simpkins) -- comes in; his exchanges with Stark are some of the films funniest.Meanwhile the U.S. government has come up with their own version of Iron Man called Iron Patriot helmed by Iron Man friend Col. James Rhodes (Don Cheadle).As directed by Shane Black taking over from Jon Favreau who did the first two Iron Man 3 is filled with a lot of things that go boom -- just what you might expect from the guy who wrote the screenplays for Last Action Hero and the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies. Yet Black who co-wrote with Drew Pearce also tries to keep things light and lively. There are many one-liners including a shout-out to the long-forgotten 1973 sci-fi film Westworld that help lessen the films predictability.And Black shows he still has a sense for displays of bravura kineticism staging one stellar action sequence involving a plane breaking up sending its passengers hurtling toward Earth.Blacks hand is probably most noticeable though in what he did with the Mandarin character whom Black and others have suggested was a racist caricature in his original incarnation. Blacks solution should satisfy both longtime fans of the comic books as well as neophytes who wouldnt know the Mandarin from Flash Gordons Emperor Ming.All of the plot strands come together for an extended if ultimately wearying display of weaponry and the setup for more shenanigans in the inevitable Iron Man 4. As usual with Marvel movies theres a short coda after the end credits. Unless youre a huge fan it may not be worth sitting through the phonebooks worth of names rolling up the screen.Though you might need that time to try and get your hearing back.

Comments (3) click to enlarge Iron Man 3 Video Rated PG-13  130 minutes  2013 None of the Iron Man movies has been as good as The Dark Knight (2008) but their mix of spectacle and droll comedy goes down a lot easier than the other franchises thumping Sturm und Drang. One might even argue that their obsession with weapons manufacturing offers as interesting a cultural critique as the surveillance element of The Dark Knight though the filmmakers have generally backed away from this idea as if it were a live grenade. This installment actually flirts with satire sending its hero-in-a-can (Robert Downey Jr.) on a vengeful mission against a mad bearded jihadist (Ben Kingsley) before yanking the rug out from under the neocon story line. There are some good laughs as well most of them involving Downeys brutal put-downs of cute little kids.

The movie releases in the USA on May 3 2013.(AP Photo/Marvel Zade Rosenthal) Film Frame Gwyneth Paltrow and Robert Downey Jr. in ""Iron Man 3.""  (AP Photo/Marvel Film Frame) As the latest model from an assembly line that has produced two blockbuster franchises ""Iron Man 3"" is bulletproof. So its pointless for a critic to complain in general terms about sequelitis and superhero overkill. But judged solely in comparison to its corporate cousins ""Iron Man 3"" is a defective model. Its lightweight but slow padded with cheap jokes to disguise how hollow it is.At the helm again is Robert Downey Jr. as playboy inventor Tony Stark whose arrogant schtick grew so tiresome in ""Iron Man 2"" and ""The Avengers"" that he wisely tries to spoof it here. Its a welcome change of pace but eventually there are so many broken-gadget pratfalls and moments of deflated egotism that they lose their effectiveness.Still the jokes are better than the sad attempts to give Stark a heart. In the very dull first half-hour of the movie he is aching about the events in ""The Avengers"" -- you know that finale when all of Manhattan was reduced to rubble by the superheroes and their adversaries. The widespread human cost of that cataclysm is barely even mentioned except for how it left Stark feeling vulnerable. Boo freakin hoo.The focus of his fears is girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) who has taken over the gizmo manufacturer Stark Industries. When a former research geek named Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) visits the company with a hunky new image and a technology for supercharging human DNA Pepper politely declines his invitation to invest. So Killian takes the technology to a television terrorist called the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) who uses it to turn humans into time bombs. Unlike Pearce Kingsley is a memorable villain particularly when he channels his inner Russell Brand. But except for a crews freefall from the besieged Air Force One the overblown 3-D action sequences are forgettable variations on the rallying cry ""Iron suits assemble"" And director/co-writer Shane Black (""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"") tarnishes the entire franchise with a sticky subplot in which Iron Man crashes in a Tennessee town and adopts a little-kid sidekick (Ty Simpkins). ""Iron Man 3"" is the creakiest comic-book movie in Marvels recent history. But hey if your idea of a good time is dodging exploded logic scattershot wisecracks and war-on-terror scare tactics knock yourself out.What ""Iron Man 3""  Two stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 210  Content Intense sci-fi action and violence Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

David Brewster Star Tribune Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint The slick engaging ""Iron Man 3"" opens with a tone-setting voiceover by self-described billionaire genius philanthropist playboy Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.). ""A famous man once said we create our own demons"" says the man in the iron mask. In this cleverly self-aware outing our seriously damaged heros journey is locating the demons he created and dealing with them. Some he can punch with a weaponized glove. Others require him to wrestle with his own hubris. Directed and co-written by Shane Black who scripted ""Lethal Weapon"" and a raft of other cheeky action-comedies the film races on a high-octane mix of spectacle sarcasm and smarts. It balances massive show-offy effects with hip knowingness and quirky human touches. Its a comic-book world seen not from the viewpoint of a fanboy but a wiseguy adult earthling. Downeys Stark is a fully formed Pop Art portrait that radiates weirdly in all directions. Hes understandably jittery following the intergalactic battles of ""The Avengers."" ""Nothings been the same since New York"" he says invoking a real-world resonance. Now flying solo hes struggling to salvage his relationship with Stark Industries CEO Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) while building ever-fancier versions of his self-protective armor. Since his version of romantic attention is buying his exasperated lover a three-story stuffed bunny and sending an empty remote-controlled Iron Man suit to keep her company while he labors in his workshop you will see that things are not going well. The film leaps backward to 1999 and a snide Stark blithely mistreating everyone he meets. His then-girlfriend Maya (Rebecca Hall) a bio-researcher and geekish genetic engineer Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) an effusive admirer who only wants five minutes of the tycoons time get a full blast of his condescension. Both will return to bedevil Stark proving the truth of that famous mans warning. Disney Disney Robert Downey Jr. stars in ""Iron Man 3."" The danger Stark faces back in the present is the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley in breathtaking form) a terrorist of Mongolian-Arabic appearance and mysterious intent. ""You will not see me coming"" he warns a line that pays off big as the clever self-aware story offers up its revelations. Dont ask me what the master plan is. Something about ""owning the war on terror."" It doesnt much matter. Black tweaks the superhero-movie formula to his own style of exhilarating nonchalance. The film takes Stark out of his near-indestructible tin suit for much of the action literally putting his vulnerable skin in the game. The finale isnt another megalopolis apocalypse but a shipyard showdown from one of Blacks noir comedies with Stark and buddy James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) firing handguns. Even minor roles are cast with unusual care. William Sadler plays the president. You may not know the veteran character actors name but his face might be familiar from his many roles as cretins traitors and murderers. Just seeing him in a suit implies hes a hypocrite. Blacks disdain for government couldnt be clearer. The story introduces Harley a manipulative but ultimately helpful little kid (Ty Simpkins) who is nearly Starks equal with snappy sarcasm. ""I saved your life"" Harley declares. ""Saved yours first"" Stark fires back. The kid humanizes Stark goading him to ease off the arrogance and embrace his inner grease monkey. With his high-tech suit inoperable he builds weapons out of kids toys and stock items from a home improvement warehouse. Marvel superhero movies have given me a lot of pleasure but not much to top the image of Downey strolling into enemy headquarters blasting henchmen with a potato gun and a sack of explosive Christmas ornaments. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

He may be emotionally damaged but it doesnt get in the way of his motivation and wry humor nor the overall entertainment of the action-packed Iron Man 3 ( out of four; rated PG-13; opens Thursday in some theaters and Friday nationwide).Tony (Robert Downey Jr.) is still a genius superhero. He remains hot for Pepper. Thats Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) his former assistant who now runs his company Stark Industries. He saved New York City from annihilation in The Avengers but it left a psychic toll. His bluster masks trepidation that in the event of another attack he wont be able to save the one he loves. Beneath Tonys taut muscles and iron armature theres a soft underbelly.VIDEO Downey Jr. really happy to be backSTORY Movie sequels and prequels galore this summerMORE The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYThis third installment (after 2008s Iron Man and 2010s Iron Man 2) has such a surfeit of visual dazzle and eye-popping stunts that it teeters on overload. But Downey reins it all in with his perfectly-timed dry wit.The Marvel universe is well-served here by director Shane Black as he pits the sardonic Stark against a corps of terrorists who take control of the airwaves. They bomb Tonys spectacular Malibu mansion to smithereens and viciously harm his top security guy Happy Hogan (former Iron Man director Jon Favreau).In his home lab Tony was accustomed to working knee-deep in holographic 3-D diagrams. But when he finds himself in a snowy corner of Tennessee minus his high-tech gadgetry Tony is forced to reconfigure his heroic alter-ego in fundamental ways. Thats where he meets young Harley (Ty Simpkins) and his cheeky repartee with the boy is particularly acerbic.Both Pepper and Col. James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes (Don Cheadle) move further into the spotlight hitting all the right good-guy notes. Rhodey emerges almost as heroic as the iron-clad Tony. Ben Kingsley is terrific as an Osama bin Laden-style terrorist called The Mandarin. Guy Pearce is solid but not memorable as Aldrich Killian the head of Extremis a biological enhancement project that creates fiery super-humans.A massive wall of credits attests to the manpower required for the ubiquitous digital effects. Action sequences are impressive particularly a scene involving an exploding plane and a dozen plummeting passengers who form a human chain.The rambunctious Iron Man 3 is a briskly paced thrill ride until about 90 minutes in when the excitement wanes. A few late-breaking surprises re-invigorate the tale however.While seemingly more explosive than its predecessors it shoehorns in a couple of sedate scenes from the Masterpiece Theatre phenomenon Downton Abbey. Its a funny juxtaposition that helps the audience catch its collective breath.But its also an intriguing reminder that it is possible to be both a Downton Abbey aficionado and an Iron Man fan.And perhaps Iron Man 4 could use an assist from steely Maggie Smith.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Time and numbers are against Iron Man as he must quickly plan a rescue when Air Force One explodes. 219 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 16 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/ZmscdT",http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~r/UsatodaycomMovies-TopStories/~3/iiY7biOVk5A/?utm_source=feedly,200,ironman324,ironman3,usatoday
"Iron Man 3 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; iron-man-3 ) Iron Man 3 (United States 2013) May 02 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli In the wake of the massive and massively successful The Avengers Iron Man 3 wisely doesnt attempt to outdo its immediate superhero predecessor when it comes to big-time action pyrotechnics and special effects. Instead it opts for something a little more small and intimate - at least as ""small"" and ""intimate"" as a movie expected to earn 1B worldwide can be. Fans of mayhem need not worry however. There are a couple of lengthy sequences that would make Michael ""blow things up real good"" Bay smile so the movie hasnt entirely abandoned summer film conventions. Iron Man 3 is the darkest of the Iron Man pictures and it also feels like the final installment of the series (although the expected strong box office performance may result in a full-court press to bring back Robert Downey Jr. for 4). Iron Man 3 boasts more exposition than either of its predecessors and focuses a little more on Tony Stark (the man). In fact theres considerably less ""Iron Man"" action than in either Iron Man or Iron Man 2 and the primary villain isnt just another guy in a bigger suit. Pacing-wise the film is uneven plunging into draggy sequences in between some spectacular peaks. There are plenty of small inconsistencies and plot holes that have the hallmarks of resulting from explanatory and/or transitional material being left on the cutting room floor. Iron Man 3 begins shortly after the events depicted in The Avengers. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) has returned to Malibu from New York with a case of insomnia. He also suffers from anxiety attacks. Instead of spending his nights cuddled up next to the love of his life Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) he tinkers with new versions of The Suit. When an attack from a terrorist known only as ""The Mandarin"" (Ben Kingsley) puts Starks faithful bodyguard Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) in a coma Tony vows revenge. This puts him in the crosshairs of The Mandarin and his henchman Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) who has discovered a way to create a new breed of suicide bombers. One of Tonys old girlfriends Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall) approaches him with insight into Killians plans at precisely the time when The Mandarin launches an all-out attack on Starks mansion. With Iron Man apparently dead the only one left to stop The Mandarin is ""Iron Patriot"" (Don Cheadle) who is given his marching orders directly from the President (William Sadler). Iron Man 3 runs into some credibility problems that result from this being a standalone adventure taking place in the Avengers universe. It seems more than a bit strange that with The Mandarin blowing up buildings and targeting the President that none of the other Avengers steps in to help Tony. The explanation - that this is a ""patriotic"" thing that needs to be handled in-house (by Americans) - doesnt make sense when considering that one of The Avengers goes by the name of ""Captain America."" The absence of S.H.I.E.L.D. is also odd (although they get a brief mention) especially remembering how ubiquitous Samuel L. Jacksons Nick Fury was in the pre-Avengers standalones. The ending while undeniably spectacular is really a deus ex machina followed by a battle in what seems like a huge Rube Goldberg machine. Its fast-paced and energetic but doesnt make a lot of sense. On the plus side its a way to vary the finale from what we got in Iron Man and Iron Man 2 but it also cheats outrageously in attempting to provide an emotionally poignant moment. Its one of those instances that proves the screenwriters lack guts. Compare Iron Man 3 to The Dark Knight and youll understand what I mean. The level of acting at one time viewed as negligible in a superhero movie is top-notch and no one seems to be mailing it in. Ben Kingsley (unsurprisingly) is the standout stealing scenes from Robert Downey Jr.  whos more low-key here than in his previous outings as Tony Stark. The character is subdued and introspective and Downey follows suit. Gwyneth Paltrow gets a chance to do a little more than play the love interest - she even gets to put on the suit at one point. After a rocky start taking over for Terrence Howard in Iron Man 2 Don Cheadle has settled into the role of James Rhodes. Guy Pearce the current go-to guy for sleazy charisma mixed with sadism does whats expected of him. James Badge Dale is the secondary villain whose inevitable comeuppance provides a mini-climax. And Rebecca Hall is criminally underused - those who want to see the actress true capabilities should check her out opposite Benedict Cumberbatch in Parades End. Iron Man 3 becomes the first of the Iron Man movies to open in 3-D and its not a move in the right direction. While the films compositions are fine many of the usual problems with converted 3-D are evident especially images that are too dark and motion blur during action sequences. By the final half-hour of this 130-minute production I felt the eye strain. From a strictly practical standpoint the 3-D adds nothing. One can make a compelling case that recent films like Oz the Great and Powerful are enhanced by 3-D but thats not the case with Iron Man 3 which seems to exist in 3-D simply because thats expected from a big summer tent-pole. Save your money and go for the 2-D version. When it comes to spectacle and narrative Iron Man 3 delivers on its promise and provides a workable post-Avengers standalone superhero storyline. Theres one especially compelling surprising twist that may shock the faithful (and could be controversial). Its a brilliant way to twist the story and offer social commentary. Director Shane Black who previously worked with Robert Downey Jr. in the underrated Kiss Kiss Bang Bang slides seamlessly into Jon Favreaus place behind the camera. Perhaps because there was nothing distinct about Favreaus directorial style its hard to tell theres been a change. The Christmas setting calls to mind the first two Die Hards although the Christmas carols arent used as effectively. If this is Downey Jr.s last stand as Iron Man in a solo movie (as he has indicated in interviews) its a solid way to end the series. Considering some of the logistical and plot-related issues that plague Iron Man 3 in the wake of The Avengers its probably best if Stark only shows up in the context of those multi-superhero extravaganzas. Theres an amusing post-credits sequence that while not adding a whole lot to the previous 130 minutes is enjoyable in its own right. (Whether its worth sitting through 8 minutes of names and generic music is an individual decision.) Iron Man 3 has the stuff to please the devotees and divert everyone else which is pretty much whats expected from the curtain-raiser of any summer season.

(Zade Rosenthal/Marvel ) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Tuesday April 30 2013 733 AM Title Talk about keeping your irons in the fire. ""Iron Man 3"" is an atomic-powered Exhibit A of how to keep a superhero franchise from rusting out. It sharply fuses the humor and heart of the earlier films with a satisfyingly heavy-metal strength -- and a darkness thats more than earned. After 2008s terrific ""Iron Man"" Robert Downey Jr.s Tony Stark was something of an empty shell in the 2010 sequel ""Iron Man 2."" But meeting up with Thor Captain America and the Hulk in last years top box-office blockbuster ""The Avengers"" reignited a spark in the character. A cool Don Cheadle plays Rhodey the Iron Patriot. In ""Iron Man 3"" it also haunts Stark just as new villains emerge. One of them is Killian (Guy Pearce) who heads up a think tank with a link to Stark as revealed during a flashback where we also meet mysterious Dr. Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall). But Killian is the one to watch. In Iron Man 3 a plot to turn humans into living weapons hits at the same time as a Bin Laden-esque terrorist called the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) threatens the world -- forcing Iron Man into action. (Marvel) Thats tricky since in the present day Killians a new man. But so is Stark Still a quip-slinging billionaire wiseass hes prone to anxiety attacks after the events in ""Avengers."" Stark now lets his pal Rhodey (a cool Don Cheadle) handle things as Iron Patriot. Killians plot to turn humans into living weapons a byproduct of weird science hits at the same time as a Bin Laden-esque terrorist called the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) threatens the world. Stark kicks into high gear and winds up in middle America where a savvy kid (Ty Simpkins) helps recalibrate Iron Man and reveals the source of the threat. Kingsleys sinister turn is straight from a 1940s serial (and a funny alter ego is very Monty Python). He mixes well with the wry Downey whose sass brings to mind an overcaffeinated auctioneer. Often without his iron mask Downey layers his rat-a-tat patter with a wild-eyed edginess. Gwyneth Paltrow as Iron Mans true love -- Pepper Potts -- is one of the films sexy secret weapons. The story machinery can get clunky -- powers are given and taken away -- but things are never boring. Director Shane Blacks appreciation of buddy-movie conceits fits like a nuke-powered glove. Pearce is an effective baddie and Hall and Gwyneth Paltrow as Tonys true love Pepper Potts are the films sexy secret weapons. They all circle Downey a ringleader who cruises through with ironclad confidence. When ""Iron Man 3"" heats up its action its a blast.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet ""When can we talk about the Avengers?"" a preteen fanboy asks Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) his world-famous terrorist-thwarting idol. The man inside the armor would rather change the subject as the mere mention of ""New York"" or ""wormhole"" sends him spiraling into a panic attack. Hes haunted by the events of The Avengers and so too is Iron Man 3 the first new Marvel movie released in the wake of that record-smashing hit. Joss Whedons crossover bonanza was designed to replenish the franchises that fed into it goosing interest in the subsequent solo outings of its respective heroes. Thats a sound business model but a backfiring entertainment strategy. Here its hard not to wish Downey were sparring with his costumed comrades again instead of trading barbs with the far-less-colorful cast members--old and new--of this busy sporadically diverting sequel. As in Jon Favreaus dismal Iron Man 2 theres no shortage of supporting characters hovering around the eponymous mogul-inventor. Although they share second billing Gwyneth Paltrow (as love interest and business partner Pepper Potts) and Don Cheadle (as the government-sponsored War Machine re-christened ""Iron Patriot"" for PR reasons) drift to the margins of the narrative. More prominent are the heavies dragged in to test the mettle (and metal) of Downeys saintly yet sardonic billionaire. In a plot turn that recalls the fallen-hero trajectory of The Dark Knight Rises the minions of a bearded tyrant called the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley whose hamminess serves a covert purpose) blow Starks mansion to smithereens. Theres also a scorned rat-bastard scientist (Guy Pearce at his oiliest) and a posse of molten-skinned henchmen better suited to an X-Men movie. New to the field of comic-book spectacles writer-director Shane Black keeps all of this chaos churning at a breakneck pace. Hints of the filmmakers personality poke through the Marvel house style The bookending narration is Kiss Kiss Bang Bang redux and only the man who penned Lethal Weapon would think to include a passage in which Cheadle and a de-armored gun-toting Downey bicker like buddy cops. Blacks most endearing experiment though is divorcing Iron Man of his iron. Never is the film livelier than when its hero stranded in the boonies without access to his toys has to rely on quick thinking and the kindness of strangers. (Amusing as always in the role Downey seems to relish his time out of the suit.) Less successful is the mandatory CGI mayhem staged more confidently than in the Favreau films but still borderline incoherent. In two hours and change Black mounts only one truly spectacular setpiece the annihilation of Air Force One and the daring midair rescue of its plummeting passengers. Playful and awe-inspiring the sequence also doubles as a metaphor for the way Iron Man 3 in its desperate attempts to please frantically juggles so many characters and crowd-pleasing components. Whedon a true believer in the medium made that balancing act look easy. Pity itll be another two years and at least that many interim single-hero installments before he gets the gang back together.

I just lost respect for you as a movie critic. Rafaelsaid on Friday June 21 2013 72519 PMWhat made this movie a classic for you Richard? This movie got so boring after the Malibu attack there was no feeling of threat the mandarin was a joke and Guy Pearce was like a disney villain. The best thing was the action sequences but common Pepper Potts a superhuman? Some of the villain making jokes when they captured Tony? Lord have Mercy Scottsaid on Wednesday May 15 2013 44049 PMLike Boris I prefer written reviews to video ones. Is there a link Im missing? Glennsaid on Saturday May 11 2013 10031 PMI enjoyed the film probably more the second time I watched it than the first. The film feels more humorous in tone than the previous ones as Tony Starks Iron Man armor is used for comical effect more often and the other characters seem to be trying to match Starks razor-tongued wit. The quirky Shane Black-ness is increased in the middle portion of the film when Stark finds himself in Tennessee with a busted prototype suit and befriending an intelligent young kid (a kid so smart he almost seems like a movie cliche) though the attempt to focus on Stark more than his armor by taking the character out of his element and stripping him of most of his toys is commendable. A big twist in regards to a certain character will feel like a cheat for some but a bigger meaning behind who the character is supposed to be in regards to our society and its need to create villains works well too. And the film certainly delivers in the action category. I particularly liked the fight scene as Tony takes on the Mandarins thugs using a gun and only a few parts of his armor as it had plenty of cheeky flair than the usual armored battle weve seen in the Iron Man series. James said on Thursday May 02 2013 54710 PM Shane Black wrote Lethal Weapon and that shows in movies like Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and Iron Man 3. Tony shooting at bad guys without his suit on didnt work for me.

"Iron Man 3 3.5 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article Iron Man 3 3.5 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED INFO Iron Man 3 Fair to good 3.5 stars Director Shane Black.Cast Robert Downey Jr. Gwyneth Paltrow Ben Kingsley.Rating PG-13 for sequences of intense sci-fi action and violence throughout and brief suggestive content. RELATED NEWS Robert Downey Jr.s 10 best films Interview Robert Downey Jr. Gwyneth Paltrow By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Wed May 1 2013 252 PM ""Iron Man 3"" starts out as if it is going to mine some genuinely unique territory in the superhero realm as Tony Stark struggles to shake the events in what he refers to as ""New York"" and the rest of us call ""The Avengers."" Its an interesting concept since most superhero franchises just move from one installment to the next as if the events of the previous film never took place (the better to be sold as a stand-alone feature; you dont have to see them all to figure out whats going on in the next one). Or maybe director and co-writer Shane Black just figured everyone had seen ""The Avengers"" already so he was safe making references to it. It looks for a time as if Black will examine the aftermath of what its like to save the world whether its a form of post-traumatic stress syndrome or simply the decompression from doing something so massive. If you stop an alien invasion on Thursday what do you have for breakfast on Friday? But that all falls away albeit in spectacular fashion as ""Iron Man 3"" by its conclusion becomes another big loud superhero explosion-fest. An entertaining big loud superhero explosion-fest mind you; when youve got Robert Downey Jr. on board as Tony you expect nothing less. But its a little disappointing to see what looks like a movie headed in a different direction eventually follow such a well-traveled path. The film actually begins in 1999 with a pre-Iron Man Tony partying it up on New Years Eve with Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall) a brilliant scientist who becomes just another one-night stand. He also manages to blow off and infuriate Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) another brilliant if weird scientist. He doesnt think much about either of them in the ensuing years. Skip ahead to the present. Tony and Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) live together but are so consumed with their jobs (hers running his company his fiddling with more and better Iron Man suits) that they actually have to schedule date nights. But Tony cant sleep and is prone to anxiety attacks when he thinks too much about what transpired during his adventures with Thor Hulk and the rest. Watching the news wont help. An Osama bin Laden-like terrorist called the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley really great) is busy broadcasting videos and making pronouncements like ""Some people call me a terrorist. I call myself a teacher. America are you ready for another lesson?"" And then he blows something up and threatens the president (William Sadler). Meanwhile Killian shows up at Peppers office where he tries to interest her in ""Extremis"" a sort of regeneration project that he considers a step up in evolution to no avail. Tony maintains a distance until events become more personal. Circumstances conspire to deposit him literally in rural Tennessee where he is helped by an 8-year-old boy (Ty Simpkins). Just when things could go all gooey Downeys wonderful cynicism kicks in. (It helps that the adorable Simpkins gives as good as he gets.) To this point Black has some fun playing with identity. Its certainly no coincidence that both Tony and the Mandarin declare (in vastly different circumstances) ""You know who I am."" Yes we do. Or at least we think we do. In both cases the answer is more complicated than it seems. There are a couple of satisfying twists one of which is hilarious. An encounter with a fanboy is also funny. And Tony must rely on his wits as much as his Iron Man suit although when the suit reemerges it does so to a ridiculous degree. By that point Black who wrote ""Lethal Weapon"" and wrote and directed ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" (which also starred Downey) among other films has reverted to conventional action-hero mode. The film is far too long with the final battle dragging until you feel pummeled. Downey is as funny as ever if not more so. He ensures that ""Iron Man 3"" is a solid installment in the franchise and helps to make it seem at least for a time that it might be something more. > Join the DiscussionView/Add Comments  >> Posting a comment to our website allows you to join in on the conversation.

"Iron Man 3 movie review starring Robert Downey Jr. - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Iron Man 3 High anxiety for Tony Stark  1/2May 06 2013|Michael Phillips | Movie criticRobert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark in ""Iron Man 3.""A little too much and a little not enough director and co-writer Shane Blacks ""Iron Man 3"" nonetheless has everything Disney and Marvel need to keep the ""Avengers"" superhero constellation shining and regenerating well into the 23rd century. Its what you call a pre-hit As of this writing (Tuesday 857 a.m. CST) the movie already has zoomed past the 200 million mark in worldwide box office.Eighty percent of the globe has already gotten a look at it. North Americas essentially an afterthought if hundreds and hundreds of millions of likely dollars can be called that.Heres where we are with Tony Stark played by Robert Downey Jr. who the films background materials remind us is the biggest star on the planet by measurement of franchise association (the ""Sherlock Holmes"" movies and the ""Iron Man""/""Avengers"" universe). The climactic alien melee in last years all-star reunion ""The Avengers"" has left Stark nerve-racked and an insomniac workaholic. A new global terrorist very much in the Bin Laden mold has oozed onto the scene The Mandarin from the comic books. As portrayed by Ben Kingsley with a strange Laurence Olivier-in-""The-Betsy"" dialect youre not quite sure where hes coming from either geographically or ideologically which is the point.In a flashback to New Years Eve 1999 Starks encounters with inventor and entrepreneur Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) and scientist Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall) set the story in motion. Everything in Starks life can be read as a Hollywood metaphor Killians the spurned fan Mayas the disposable one-night-stand who years later comes back into his life. The nerd-turned-smoothie Killian who has a bit of history with Starks partner and lover Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is working on a human evolution project known as ""Extremis.""Meantime fire-breathing mutants are wreaking havoc at one point taking down Graumans Chinese Theater in Hollywood. The Mandarin goes about his business destroying Starks home slaughtering innocent civilians in the name of teaching America a lesson. Stark ends up in rural Tennessee where in a gleefully cynical bid for a preteen audience (a few years too young for the violence in ""Iron Man 3"" Id say) Stark befriends a bullied 8-year-old (Ty Simpkins) who becomes his tag-along and sometime savior.A strange detail In ""Iron Man 3"" Stark no longer needs to be in the Iron Man suit. Hes able to operate the thing remotely when needed. The movies like that too. Its decent superhero blockbustering but rather remote and vaguely second-hand. At this point even with Blacks flashes of black humor the machinery is more or less taking care of itself offering roughly half of the genial wit and enjoyment of the first ""Iron Man.""Blacks not especially lucid or creative in staging massive action sequences; even the major set-piece in which Stark attempts the mid-air rescue of Air Force One passengers is a medium wow at best. (Which qualifies it more for ""yeah big whoop"" status.) On the other hand when the truth behind The Mandarin arrives its a wild ""reveal"" and very much in tune with Blacks sense of self-referential showbiz humor which he twisted into a very interesting pretzel in ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.""From the ""Lethal Weapon"" franchise to ""The Last Boy Scout"" Black loves jocular sadism and theres a lot of it (too much) in ""Iron Man 3."" When Stark goes on a killing spree its as if weve been dropped back into Mel Gibson/Danny Glover-land. For all the trauma Starks supposed to be shouldering Downey rarely seems less than superhumanly cool. Hes a huge talent verbally adroit and quick on his feet even when the feet are encased in digital metal. But one of the things I resisted about the second ""Iron Man"" the parts where Stark became a badly behaved trashed-out party boy has cooled into a kind of imperious remove in ""Iron Man 3.""No less than ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" which placed a detective story inside the world of Hollywood wannabes ""Iron Man 3"" treats Stark and Downey as untouchable superstars just gliding through. Its not without its payoffs; I enjoyed a lot of it. But overall last years ""Avengers"" delivered the bombastic goods more efficiently than this years Marvel.mjphillipstribune.comIron Man 3 -- 2 1/2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for sequences of intense sci-fi action and violence throughout and brief suggestive content)Running time 209Opens Thursday midnight MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Life Skill 201 Washing a baseball capLongtime nursing home operators must face trial judge rules10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesGuy Pearce bonds with Iron Man 3 Actor to play...April 20 2012NFL Draft Preview Team Needs Nice Fits - Part 3April 23 2012The gangs all here in The Avengers ???April 30 2012How Marvel is Turning to Short Films to Sell More DVDs...July 23 2013Reuters Entertainment News SummaryAugust 18 2012Find More Stories AboutTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter",http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-04-30/entertainment/sc-mov-0430-iron-man-3-20130501_1_iron-man-3-aldrich-killian-shane-black,200,ironman331,ironman3,chicagotribune

(Disney) A- Iron Man 3 Genre Action/Adventure; Starring Don Cheadle Robert Downey Jr. Gwyneth Paltrow; Director Shane Black; Release Date Wide 05/03/2013; Runtime (in minutes) 129; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Walt Disney Pictures Posted May 31 2013 -- 1200 AM EDT Iron Man 3 is an ominously exciting shoot-the-works comic-book spectacular. It keeps throwing things at you but not with the random busy franchise indifference that marked the hollow and grandiose Iron Man 2. Iron Man 3 is closer to a vision of the world teetering on the edge. (Imagine The Dark Knight Rises with less apocalyptic hot air.) The film was directed and co-written by Shane Black the former high-testosterone action screenwriter (Lethal Weapon) who in 2005 directed the quirky half-baked Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. His work here isnt just skillful -- its fast and furious. He wires each scene for maximum intensity and the result is that rarity a superhero thrill ride with something at stake. Robert Downey Jr.s defining trait as an actor -- the way he tosses off each line with speedy nattering insouciance as though he were talking to himself which he basically is -- can make it seem like nothing hes saying really matters. This time though Downey turns Tony Starks reflexive motormouthed mockery into something at once dread-fueled and humane a barely camouflaged expression of his fevered anxiety. At the beginning Stark is testing out his latest brainstorm a system that allows his Iron Man armor to zip through the air in pieces and cling to him as if he were magnetized. The hurtling metal almost appears to be attacking him and thats a metaphor for what hell face at every turn. Theres an ultra-terrorist on the loose a global troublemaker called the Mandarin played by Ben Kingsley with a scraggly beard and medieval hair. With his methodical low voice hes a scarily ""rational"" psycho cult leader. When the Mandarin takes over the airwaves hes like Osama bin Laden recast as a Bond villain and Kingsley bites into the role with lurid gusto. The films other baddie is Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce at his most sleekly nasty) a former geek scientist whos working in cahoots with the Mandarin (and thanks to a great twist thats putting it mildly). He has turned a group of the damaged and the maimed into walking weapons with molten flesh. Goaded by the press Stark invites the Mandarin to come at him and come at Stark he does -- with rocket launchers that destroy Starks home in the first of many darkly bedazzling action sequences all edited with a detonating precision that renders the violence that much more voluptuously threatening. Iron Man 3 is mostly liberated from the market-tested three-act structure that hobbles too many comic-book films. This one feels like a deep-dish middle installment that strands Stark without any protection -- in this case in the hinterlands of Tennessee where he crash-lands only to learn that his Iron Man suit no longer works. There are hilariously tense encounters with the local yokels a testy camaraderie between Stark and his War Machine rival James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) an abiding romantic tension to his bond with Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow) and a climax thats a flat-out epic piece of action-fantasy engineering. I cant say I was moved by Iron Man 3 but I was transported.

The latest in the ""Iron Man"" franchise wont insult your intelligence although it doesnt exude the smarts of the best comic book-based flicks. It has some neat action set pieces a very sharp and self-aware performance by star Robert Downey Jr. (almost a given now with Downey) and a lively turn by Ben Kingsley as the villainous Mandarin. The film has notable flaws but they never rise to the level of becoming fatal. In other words its decent popcorn entertainment -- just fine for the summertime but nothing more than that.Fans of the Iron Man comic books will recognize the storyline that director/writer Shane Black (""Lethal Weapon"") and his co-writer Drew Pearce (the upcoming ""Pacific Rim"") draw on for their script. ""Extremis"" was a six-book 2005-06 arc that is widely considered one of the best in the characters long history. Considerable liberties have been taken but many of the basics are there.""Iron Man 3"" takes place sometime after the ""Avengers"" throwdown with Loki in New York City with Tony Stark (Downey) suffering from something close to post-traumatic stress. Hes with his lover/long-time assistant Pepper Potts (Paltrow) but he spends most of his time tinkering with new armored suits while she runs Stark Industries.Advertisement In the background the Mandarin -- a bad guy from the earliest Iron Man comics -- is wreaking havoc around the world with a series of attacks. (Kingsley plays him delightfully as a cross between an Afghan warlord and a fire-and-brimstone Southern preacher.) Since things are never quite as simple as they seem two figures from Starks past -- brilliant inventor Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) and scientist/former lover Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall) -- pop up unexpectedly. (Hes the founder of Advanced Idea Mechanics aka A.I.M. a reference that will trigger an ""uh oh"" from devoted comic geeks.)When the Mandarin launches an attack that nearly kills Starks friend and security chief Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau director of the first two films) the battle lines are drawn. The terrorist launches a spectacular full-on helicopter assault on Starks lavish Malibu home that nearly kills our hero and Potts. But Stark survives and is soon off on a cross-country chase that eventually involves an experimental miracle drug called Extremis powerful and fiery super soldiers an attack on Air Force One and a final showdown on the Miami waterfront.The story should work especially given an engaging cast. But it doesnt and most of the flaws can be traced to Black. Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.)in ""Iron Man 3."" Ph Zade Rosenthal/Marvel Studios ( Zade Rosenthal/Marvel Studios ) A few director-writers such as Whedon and Christopher Nolan (""Dark Knight"") are comfortable with the conventions of the superhero world. But Black isnt one of them and it shows. He does craft some strong individual scenes and a couple of neat twists but the film is too jokey with Black launching a shotgun blast of self-aware humor. There are some hits but too many misses.At times ""Iron Man 3"" strays way too close in tone to Blacks ""Lethal Weapon"" as if Mel Gibsons Martin Riggs has suddenly taken over the armored suit.Still theres enough to the film that there is zero chance people wont line up to see it. For that Marvel should really be grateful to the cast particularly Downey. This may be the last ""Iron Man"" for the actor -- at least as a solo adventure. (He definitely will suit up for ""Avengers 2."") And the film does have a certain endgame feel to it.If thats the case its too bad. Downey has been really good to the suit turning Iron Man/Stark into a most intriguing and enjoyable character.For film news and more follow Charlie McCollum at Twitter.com/charlie_mccollu.IRON MAN 3   1/2Rating PG-13 (for comic book violence and action)Cast Robert Downey Jr. Gwyneth Paltrow Ben Kingsley and Don CheadleDirector Shane BlackRunning time 2 hours 15 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Curb Your Enthusiasm The long wait for new episodes is almost overA Game of Thrones spin-off?

Rated PG-13 (bloodless violence) BOTTOM LINE The usual winks and snarks from Tony Stark but this edition feels fresher and funnier thanks to writer- director Shane Black (""Lethal Weapon""). The post-credits kicker is worth the wait. CAST Robert Downey Jr. Gwyneth Paltrow Guy Pearce Rebecca Hall LENGTH 209 Everyone likes the ""Iron Man"" movies right? The metal-clad billionaire-hero also known as Tony Stark has become so popular that even the people in his movies treat him like a movie star. ""Im your biggest fan"" some guy gushes getting a little too close to his idol. One young boy even brings up Iron Mans supergroup which hit screens last May ""What about The Avengers?"" he wants to know. Call it self-promotion or just realism but ""Iron Man 3"" with Robert Downey Jr. reprising the swaggering title role takes place in a world where superheroes are the new normal. Back in the quaint 1970s Superman amazed Lois Lane simply by hovering outside her high-rise apartment but ""Iron Man 3"" is way beyond such wide-eyed wonder. ""Ever since that big dude with the hammer fell out of the sky"" says one villain ""subtletys kind of had its day."" Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? So whats left in this postmodern Marvel universe? Well action and comedy still work and director and co-writer Shane Black (""Lethal Weapon"") combines them skillfully in ""Iron Man 3."" The self-amused winks and nods can be grating but the movie also has just enough energy and imagination to keep it from feeling overly slick and easy. Dont worry too much about Iron Mans anxiety attacks (brought on by those ""Avengers"" memories) the execution videos broadcast by anti-American terrorist The Mandarin (an enjoyable Ben Kingsley) or the gruesome lab experiments of bioengineer Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce). Iron Man is still the anti-Batman all zip and zingers. Hes also suddenly rather family-friendly. Some of the movies best moments are shared by Stark and latchkey kid Harley (Ty Simpkins) who mock their budding father-son relationship while acting it out. There are some memorable set pieces particularly a game of catch-the-passengers (after an airplane goes kablooey) and an acrobatic climax that even pulls in Pepper Potts 206 MoviesIron Man 3 trailer (Gwyneth Paltrow showing off her impressive 40-year-old abs). Its not exactly emotionally involving but thats never been this franchises strength.

But for Tony Stark whose invention of an airborne Iron Man suit made him a superhero the image of a flying man falling signals something worse than an anxiety attack. It is a harbinger of career suicide. Not just Tony the Mensa zillionaire played with such admirable arrogance by Robert Downey Jr. but the entire Iron Man franchise seemed on life support when Jon Favreaus Iron Man 2 arrived in 2010. That pallid sequel existed only because the 2008 original was a worldwide smash -- the economic imperative of many an action sequel. The first movie also directed by Favreau had a lot going for it especially its making a hero of that peculiarly American species of capitalist genius who builds stuff makes it move fast and earns a huge profit. Thats exactly what the Marvel guys who expanded the characters from their comics into some sensational movie escapism did for Hollywood. (READ Corlisss reviews of Iron Man and Iron Man 2) Last spring Joss Whedons The Avengers partially restored Starks verve and luster as well as selling 1.5 billion worth of tickets worldwide. Now director and co-writer Shane Black whose name sounds as if it belonged to one of Tonys suaver adversaries really gets the franchise soaring with Iron Man Three (known in its advertising as Iron Man 3) and launches the summer blockbuster season with a movie of nifty thrills and ruthless sauciness. [    Warning Entering Spoiler Zone    ] ""Some call me a terrorist"" says the robed bearded figure known as the Mandarin. ""I say Im a teacher."" This revived bin Laden commandeers American TV sets and perhaps all social media with threats dire but unspecified. They begin with a massacre in the forecourt of Hollywoods Chinese Theater and escalate to a kidnapping of the U.S. President on Air Force One (which makes IM3 the third of four 2013 movies -- after Olympus Has Fallen and G.I. Joe Retaliation and before this summers White House Down -- to use an abducted POTUS as a plot device). When Tony rashly announces his home address and W-style invites the Mandarin to bring it on helicopters demolish his Malibu mansion. Like Disneys early animated features which petrified children by exploiting their fears of separation death and disfigurement modern action films scare adult audiences with doomsday scenarios ripped from the darkest headlines. Beginning on the final New Years Eve of the last millennium and ending on Christmas Day of a year like this one IM3 spans the brief grisly history of the worldwide jihadist impulse. The script by Black and Drew Pierce manages to create a fanciful but plausible agency of organized evil -- this Osama-Oz and his confederates -- and concoct a satisfying resolution to geopolitical meltdown. Ahh if only real-life atrocity could be overcome in a happy Marvel ending. If only Tony Stark ruled the world as he thinks is his due. (READ Is Iron Man the Only Interesting Marvel Superhero?) Back on that fateful New Years Eve in Bern Switzerland a scruffy nerd named Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) tried to interest Tony in a very advanced gadget. Tony ignored the proposal being too busy partying like it was 1999 which it was. Thirteen years later Killian has created his own megacompany spiffed himself up -- his hair could be an exhibit in the Cool Coiffure Museum -- and with the aid of biologist Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall) perfected his invention Extremis which can ""hack into the hard drive of any living organism"" and upgrade its DNA. The product has a few kinks like making those who ingest it glow from the inside and then explode. But Killian figures life is cheap. Before they expire his minions will have slaughtered hundreds by ejecting laser blasts from their fingers. (This is the comic-bookiest part of IM3.) (READ How The Avengers conquered the movie world) To kill Killian and manhandle the Mandarin Tony probably doesnt think he needs help -- ""Its moments like these"" he purrs as he dons his Iron Man togs ""when I realize how much of a superhero I am"" -- but he gets it anyway from Colonel James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) whose space uniform makes him the War Machine and from Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) Tonys resolute girlfriend CEO of Stark Enterprises and when she dons her own flying suit Iron Lady. (SEE A Sneak Peak at the Heroes and Villains of Iron Man Three) Tonys most devoted assistant though is a Tennessee 10-year-old named Harley (Ty Simpkins an endearingly kidlike child actor) who -- like the boy who idolizes and helps the outlaw played by Matthew McConaughey in Mud -- brings his hero food and the tools to get his craft back in tiptop shape. Harleys other function in a standard-issue action film might be to serve as an ideal-son figure to a restless man. But Black will permit no dewy bonding; Tony is as curt with the boy as he is with anyone else he momentarily needs. He cant be a father because he has never grown up; he is the perpetual boy genius. [   Now Leaving Spoiler Zone   ] Heres one of the cool things about the Marvel bosses managing of their movie empire figuring that their special-effects wizards can take care of the action scenes they often assign their biggest productions to directors not known for comic-book pictures. Favreau had been an indie actor (Singles) and director (More) and Whedon had created self-referential TV shows (Buffy Angel Dollhouse). Ang Lee genre-trotted from English teacup (Sense and Sensibility) to Chinese martial arts (Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) to the 2003 Hulk movie. Bryan Singer made three low-budget features including The Usual Suspects before being handed the X-Men franchise. Sam Raimi graduated from no-budget horror (The Evil Dead) and humid bayou melodrama (The Gift) to the Spider-Man trilogy. Spidey got a reboot last year from Marc Webb whose only previous feature was the modest rom-com (500) Days of Summer. All these directors were in their mid-30s to mid-40s when they got their Marvel gigs and most had grown up reading comic books about the heroes they would bring to the screen. Black is older at 51 and has been a Hollywood legend or cautionary tale for a quarter-century since the UCLA film-school grad wrote the script for Lethal Weapon the 1987 inspiration for a long run of smart-ass action comedies. In an industry where screenwriters are the least overpaid contributors to box-office success Black got 1.75 million for his Bruce Willis movie The Last Boy Scout (pretty bad) and 4 million for The Long Kiss Goodnight (very good). Both films flopped as did a Black rewrite Last Action Hero and by the mid-90s he was no longer Harry Hot. In the past 15 years his only feature script credit and his first stint as director was the criminally underappreciated (by me) 2005 crime comedy Kiss Kiss Bang Bang which provided Downey with one of his few prime roles in a period when he was as toxicologically reliable as Lindsay Lohan is today. (READ Corlisss churlish review of Shane Blacks Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) For Marvel to choose Black as director and co-writer of an Iron Man movie might seem its own reckless perhaps hopeless gesture of rehabilitation. But he too was a fan of the series telling the Scotsman ""Ive been reading Iron Man since I bought my first issue in 1966 as a 4-year-old kid."" An early Black script for 1987s The Monster Squad had assembled a platoon of venerable Universal fright gods (Dracula the Wolf Man the Mummy Frankensteins monster the Creature from the Black Lagoon) in a kind of premature Avengers. And when Downey now the most important actor in the Marvel galaxy puts in a good word for his old friend people listen. Obliged by the PG-13 rating to mute the splenetic cussing that was a glory point of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (""To all you good people in the Midwest"" Val Kilmer says as the end credits roll ""sorry we said f-- so much"") Black still shoehorned some of his favorite tropes into IM3. Like Last Action Hero it brings an iconic character into contact with a ""real"" boy who idolizes him. Following Lethal Weapon The Last Boy Scout Last Action Hero The Long Kiss Goodnight and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang the new movie is set at Christmastime. IM3 could even be seen as Blacks reworking of Dickens A Christmas Carol with Tony as Scrooge Maya (a former Stark girlfriend) Killian and the Mandarin as the Ghosts of Christmas Past Present and Future and Harley as Tiny Tim. The best Christmas present for the Stark Scrooge at the end he gets a heart. (SEE TIMEs Top 10 Worst Christmas Movies) As for the meta-movie gags often strewn through Blacks scripts theyre mostly limited here to references to The Avengers which after all was Tonys previous adventure and which he is as reluctant to discuss as kids are to pester him about it. ""Howd you get out of the wormhole?"" one lad wants to know; Tony wont say. And when Harley asks him ""What about The Avengers? Can we talk about that?"" (note he means not them the team but that the movie) Tony mutters ""Later."" Its a tribute to Downeys gruff charm that he doesnt lose his audience by refusing to sugarcoat Tonys relationship with a winsome boy -- and that the most oratorically gifted of current Hollywood stars can turn one word into an aria of self-sufficiency. Later could be never. Who needs The Avengers? Not this movie (though if you stay seated through 10 minutes of end credits youll find Tony on the psychiatrists couch telling his problems to a most unsuitable shrink). For all its sprawling diversions last years box-office champ seems like small change compared with the much more vigorous and focused IM3. Besides rehabbing a hero who overcomes anxiety to save the world and defeat the terror-industrial complex by the simple matter of cloning his body armor the movie proves that theres still intelligent life on Planet Marvel. As youre propelled out of the theater on IM3s hydraulic lift of pleasures youre likely to say ""That is how its done.""

If you stuck around after the voluminous credits of last summers The Avengers you saw the gang exhaustedly tucking into some shawarma a modest yogurt-sauced payback for saving New York City. After six interrelated films in five years fatigue is here. Redemptively Robert Downey Jr. brings a small acknowledgement of this overtiredness to Iron Man 3 a sequel that plays strongest when its remembering to be human. After a brief prologue set in 1999 in which a high-flying Tony Stark seduces a geeky botanist (Rebecca Hall) and accidently births a future villain (Guy Pearce) by making him wait for a nonexistent meeting (touchy) we see todays Iron Man racked by postwormhole traumatic stress endlessly tinkering in his mansion and acting fairly Hughesian. Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow) his patient girl Friday sees the charming man inside but evil has no timetable and random pirate broadcasts from the bin Laden-looking Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) promise global horrors. That palatial Malibu house is going down in a hail of explosive gunfire--already you can tell--and when it happens the Iron Man saga undergoes the kind of freshening up it needed after a brief flirtation with a Russian-accented Mickey Rourke. Take Stark to an unlikely place (rural Tennessee) have the magical suit totally fail him have him attract a curious wiseass of a preteen sidekick (Ty Simpkins avoiding the worst cliches of the gig)--all of these things occur and best of all Downey lets the old edginess fly even when demanding a tuna sandwich. How is this different from what fans are expecting? Not by much--or not radically so. But the shift in tone more impulsive and nervier can be attributed to director Shane Black once the king of Hollywood A-list screenwriters with Lethal Weapon. (Downey owes much of his comeback to Blacks behind-the-camera debut 2005s Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.) Given the keys to the franchise and a role in the writing Black has massively upped the verbal sparring and kept the broad inventiveness of comic-book malleability in mind. ""Im a mechanic"" Stark says to the boy in a moment of self-doubt. Thats 100% Black that line a tidy code of craft and the jitters pass. The most wonderful of Blacks surprises harkens back to his 80s reputation for character revision and is simply too good to ruin here. Suffice it to say that while The Dark Knight Risess metal-mouthed Bane spawned a host of viral videos that put hip-hop lyrics in his head Kingsleys slippery character will not require such tinkering. An amazing air rescue involving some truly scary skydiving and freefalling is an adrenalizing sequence outclassing several blockbusters. For a good stretch you can convince yourself that youre watching a summer movie thats firing on all cylinders not just the ones involving huge sums of money being wasted. So why finally are we down at the docks--in the dark no less--for one of those lumbering climaxes involving swinging shipping cranes? The energy bleeds out of the film; its as if the producers were scared the crowd would riot over not enough digital fakeness. Oh well Theres always next years chapter. Rest up Tony.

The villains are all wrong the motivations are muddy even the gadgetry is off. And the swaggering genius at the center of it all has become a preening fool. Its like watching a great company switch CEOs from Steve Jobs to Donald Trump. Tony Stark still jumpy with post-traumatic stress from his ""Avengers"" visit to New York City (I guess this town aint for California cream puffs pal) challenges a terrorist (Ben Kingsley) called the Mandarin who murders Americans on live TV. Meanwhile an inventor-turned-magnate (Guy Pearce) whom Tony once insulted has developed a system for regenerating human limbs. But that has the side effect of turning its beneficiaries/victims into human bombs. Theres also Tonys scientist ex-girlfriend (Rebecca Hall) who cant seem to make up her mind whether to be good or evil. Tony (Robert Downey Jr.) giving out his Malibu home address on live TV invites the terrorists to attack him. So they do destroying his house. Oops. Why invite an onslaught if youre unprepared for it? And why is the worlds smartest man blindsided by helicopters? Is he unfamiliar with the 1940s technology known as ""radar""? Tony is supposed to be arrogant not moronic. Ben Kingsley in ""Iron Man 3"" (Zade Rosenthal) Unintentionally Tony winds up in snowy Tennessee far from his kidnapped ladylove Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and his friend Col. Rhodes (Don Cheadle). While his Iron Man suit is recharging the movie stops for some twee interaction with a fatherless boy (Ty Simpkins) who has been cooking up inventions in his garage. Previously the series has been one of the more grown-up superhero franchises but ""IM3"" is aimed straight at middle school. Gone are all of the actual ideas (such as Tonys robust defense of capitalism) gone is the witty dialogue gone is anything like character development (Tony and Rhodes barely share any screen time and when they do theyre ducking and running). Instead we get about 20 minutes of adorable kid. What next a little Chihuahua in Tonys pocket? RELATED BEHIND-THE-SCENES OF THE NEW IRON MAN MOVIE The Mandarin is even more unbearable than the boy. Though his logo features Arabic writing and swords like the one on the Saudi flag and he is wearing a big bushy Islamist beard he speaks in a bizarre accent that seems to be Kingsleys idea of what rural Americans sound like. The effect is like Osama bin Laden meets Waylon Jennings. You dont know if youre supposed to think Taliban or ""Hee-Haw."" Whats the message here? My guess There isnt one. Writer-director Shane Black the author of ""Lethal Weapon"" who was essentially laughed out of Hollywood after writing the flops ""The Last Boy Scout"" ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" and ""Last Action Hero"" -- and who has never before directed a film except the campy faux noir ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" -- is not the man to deliver cultural resonance. The blurring of the Mandarin character is meant to cover up his Chinese origins in the Iron Man comics so as not to offend the real-life mandarins of Beijing. Meanwhile Black borrows from (and hence trivializes) the savagery of the real-life Talibans bloody videos. Also He plays the character for laughs. The Mandarin (to quote a cliche that pops up twice in the script) is a hot mess. Pearce is a splendid actor but he overacts to compensate for the generic writing of his inventor character Aldrich Killian. Are we supposed to believe his evil derives from being dissed in an elevator? And what is Hall as Tonys ex doing here except to satisfy some focus groups call for more feminine presence? She fails to threaten Tonys relationship and no clue is given as to why she would be allied with a psychopath. As for the other woman Pepper is reduced to cringing at Tonys gift of a stuffed bunny with giant hooters (an instance of sophistication giving way to middle-school humor as is a toilet gag involving a villain). Pepper also gets to wear the Iron Man suit but if anyone can use it why do we need Tony? Its like Marion picking up Indiana Jones bullwhip or Lois Lane putting on the super-spandex. Moreover thanks to a new remote device Tony doesnt even need to be in the same state with the Iron Man suit. He just sticks his hand out like hes hailing a cab and the parts fly to him wherever he is. This is cheating. Iron Man isnt supposed to be a magician. This wrinkle makes things too easy for him. By the time the climax arrived I had lost interest but it disappointed me anyway with its senseless clutter. What is the president of the United States doing in an Iron Man suit? Theres also a platoon of remote-controlled Iron Men randomly showing up to save the day and just as randomly disappearing before being randomly blown up. Tonys suit pops on and off in pieces for no reason except the director likes the way the special effects look even the 10th time around. This movie has a bad case of Iron Man inflation When youve got a hundred disposable ones zipping around they start to seem as special as Aluminum Dudes.

Film Credits Mounts MPAA Claims Iron Man 3 Created 2000 Jobs Huge Iron Man 3 Overseas Debut Validates Super Sequel Strategy Robert Downey Jr. makes the witty banter and explosive action zing -- just dont worry too much about the convoluted plot When we think about films written by Shane Black -- ""Lethal Weapon"" ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" (which he also directed) -- several things come to mind Christmas imagery rapid-fire banter over-the-top pyrotechnics. All of Blacks best features get ample showing in ""Iron Man 3"" the big-budget superhero sequel he directed and co-wrote (with Drew Pearce ""No Heroics""). Those less generously inclined might point out that Blacks villains tend to be unmemorable with world-shaking schemes that dont make a lot of sense and his climactic battles tend to throw in not just the kitchen sink but also the trash compacter the coffee maker and even the lawn mower for good measure. Also read Huge Iron Man 3 Overseas Debut Validates Super Sequel Strategy Those flaws too rear their heads in the film but if youre the sort of viewer for whom Blacks strengths more than make up for his weaknesses the best bits of ""Iron Man 3"" will make the lesser stuff worth forgiving -- or at least worth enduring. This sequel sees billionaire inventor Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr. who previously teamed with Black to great effect in ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"") beloved by the world after his planet-saving heroics at the climax of ""The Avengers."" Hes barely able to enjoy the adulation however as hes been plagued with insomnia and anxiety attacks ever since. Compounding his stress is a global terrorist known as The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) -- the original comic-book character as the name suggests was a Fu Manchu-ey half-Chinese villain bent on world domination but to avoid offending the worlds biggest new movie marketplace hes now a bin Laden-esque terrorist with a penchant for committing nefarious deeds and then boasting about them on video. Also read As Opposition to N.C. Film Credits Mounts MPAA Claims Iron Man 3 Created 2000 Jobs Also popping up is rival scientist Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) who Stark once cruelly shrugged off at a Y2K celebration and who has developed a ""brain upgrade"" called Extremis which can rearrange the DNA to repair broken bodies but which also has more nefarious purposes as well. The process tends to be unstable leading to his subjects occasionally exploding in rather nasty ways. Black gives Downey reams of quotable hilarious dialogue (""Kiss Kiss"" fans will love the fact that the film opens with narration that he begins and then starts over); Stark also has relationships and interactions with both returning characters (Gwyneth Paltrow""gt;Gwyneth Paltrow as love interest Pepper Potts Don Cheadle as the Army officer who controls War Machine now rechristened Iron Patriot) and new ones (notably Ty Simpkins as Harley a tech-minded youngster who helps Stark when he needs it most) that feel specific and thought-out. Starks ongoing refusal to treat the kid like a kid in fact provides some of the movies best moments. Unfortunately the film doesnt devote as much energy to Killian and the hero/villain imbalance undercuts the many joys of ""Iron Man 3."" The rules of Extremis for instance are never really explained so were not quite sure when the process is going to backfire on its users or what the parameters of their new abilities are. (The steps of Killians master plan dont entirely make sense either.) But again if youre willing to work around the movies shortcomings there are plenty of moments to savor from the excellent selection of holiday music (from Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass Dwight Yoakam and Joe Williams to name a few) to a terrific array of character actors including Adam Pally of ""Happy Endings"" (as a Stark fanboy) Dale Dickey and Rebecca Hall (as a past conquest of Starks whose botanical discoveries play a key role in developing Extremis). One of the unusual aspects of the ""Iron Man"" series is that its given Gwyneth Paltrow one of the most appealing and proactive characters in her career but this chapter doesnt quite know what to do with her simultaneously throwing her into the action (she gets to wear the armor for a few scenes becoming a de facto Iron Maiden) while also making her exceedingly helpless for much of the films slam-bang finale trapped under rubble and suspended from a crane in true ""Perils of Pauline"" fashion. You could power a whole movie out of Paltrow and Downeys romantic chemistry but too often their charisma gets buried in the International Box-Office Behemoth Machine that ""Iron Man 3"" becomes when the sharp dialogue gets pushed aside in favor of the ka-blams. Black occasionally tries to make political points about environmentalism and distracting the public with boogeymen while the real bad guys operate in the shadows but they get lost among the explosions. Not that the action sequences arent often top-notch in one particularly breathtaking sequence Iron Man rescues a dozen people who have been blown out of Air Force One by snapping them up one by one and forming a human chain. No matter whats falling out of the sky or catching fire the movie never lets us forget about the people inside those suits of armor. While ""The Avengers"" showed how well a film could serve the twin masters of Smart Characters We Care About and Lets Blow Up the Planet ""Iron Man 3"" doesnt nail the balance quite as well. But those smart characters are there and theyre given just enough to do and say to make the movie entertaining for viewers who are more interested in the man than the iron.

Theres no doubt hes the star of Iron Man 3; he sprints through the picture like a neurotic panther. And yet hes absent detached in a Zen-like way from the whole affair. The nakedness that defines his best performances--about any role up to and including the first Iron Man in 2008--has become paradoxically a kind of mask not unlike the sleek airbrushed-looking one he wears as the superhero incarnation of cocky kajillionaire Tony Stark. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - In the first Iron Man Downeys performance wasnt so far from the one hed given years before in Chaplin. Both characters shouldered enormous egos surrounded by shells of fragility--you had to love the whole egg. But today Downey could play Stark in his sleep. The jittery self-doubt the look-at-me hubris the Boy Scout cluelessness about women He can dial up whatever he needs. Hes become so proficient in his believability that you can hardly believe a minute of it.Maybe you dont need to believe much in Iron Man 3. This is the first in the franchise to be directed by Shane Black and only the second picture the prolific action screenwriter has made. (The first was the marvelously nerve-jangling Kiss Kiss Bang Bang also starring Downey.) On the plus side Black has a puckish sense of humor and he shows a healthy resistance to the comic-booky self-seriousness of the Batman movies. The villains in Iron Man 3 for example include the Mandarin a pointy-bearded sage whos half Osama bin Laden half Ming the Merciless. Hes played with bug-eyed hamminess by Ben Kingsley and the movie is spooky silly or both whenever hes onscreen.Film Details Iron Man 3 RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time135 More Info Trailer But the big problems with Iron Man 3 are less specific to the movie itself than they are characteristic of the hypermalaise thats infected so many current mega-blockbusters--too much plot too much action too many characters too many pseudo-feelings. The mechanics of Iron Man 3 are complex and rambunctious like Keystone Kops bouncing off one another and ultimately canceling one another out. The movie opens with a flashback to 1999 before Tony Stark suffered the near-fatal injury that led to his becoming a superhero. Hes a playboy having a fling with a nerdy-gorgeous scientist (played by a beguiling but underused Rebecca Hall) who has discovered a breakthrough nanotechnology that in the wrong hands can turn human beings into flaming weapons. The wrong hands it turns out belong to Guy Pearces sleazy-debonair Aldrich Killian who in the movies present plans to use this fancy science to kidnap the president.Along the way Killian tries to seduce Starks now-live-in girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). He may have a shot Its Christmastime and Starks gift to her is a stuffed rabbit the size of a water tower. For this and other reasons Stark is banished to the bad-boyfriend doghouse though he claims to have a good excuse for his erratic behavior Hes a sleepless mess self-tortured to the point of exhaustion and he can concentrate on nothing beyond adding to his collection of increasingly sophisticated Iron Man suits--hes become Flash Gordons answer to Pierre Cardin.Stark will need those suits to fend off a fusillade of special effects including but not limited to bad guys whose flesh glows fiery orange the usual explosions of increasing intensity and the destruction of Starks futuro-groovy seaside home and suit-building atelier. The gratuitous grandness of these effects shouldnt be underestimated Theyre big all right and the finale includes a soaring phalanx of Iron Men thats at least momentarily awe-inspiring.And yet all this adds up to so little. (To the extent that directors of photography even matter in superhero movies anymore Iron Man 3 was shot by John Toll and it looks generically extravagant.) Theres no real drama here or if there is Black gives us no time to let it sink in before moving on to the next cataclysmic signpost. The pictures climax especially strives for emotional grandeur Black and Downey even toy with the idea of a tragic ending.But any despair we might feel is quickly and cheerfully reversed. Nothing in Iron Man 3 is all that dark or serious despite Downeys autopilot efforts to prove how dark and serious his character really is. Stark broods he wisecracks he offers throwaway advice to a winsome kid (played by Ty Simpkins) whose father has split ""Dads leave; theres no need to be a pussy about it."" Downeys firecracker dialogue sometimes feels improvised--maybe it is--and its often bitterly funny. To respond to his vulnerability is to thrill to his sharpness as well; keeping up with him is much of the pleasure of watching him.But Downey may have taken Tony Stark as far as he can. Hes as fine an actor as weve got always alive and receptive without being too precious about it. Which is why its strange to watch a Downey performance and to feel nothing. He has a great deal of swagger and perhaps more physical agility than ever. But perhaps even he is exhausted by the too-muchness of Iron Man 3 and its ilk. Or maybe its time for those of us who adore him to face facts Its too hard to love a man who dresses like a toy.Follow VoiceFilmClub 1 Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Stephanie Zacharek Follow szacharek Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Now he no longer has to actually be in the suit -- he can stay safely outside and just fly the little hollow robot around. Its an unintended but appropriate metaphor for the movie. Because as slickly enjoyable as all the effects are theres something empty about the film. Like Tonys suits its shiny and polished. But this time theres nobody inside. The story picks up sometime after ""The Avengers"" an event which has apparently left Tony with post-traumatic stress. (Perhaps thats why hes now working on this Robo Man.) His anxiety is about to increase though. Because a terrorist called the Mandarin is blowing up civilians. Strange fiery mutants are stalking America. Tonys pal Happy in a coma -- and oh yeah things arent great with Tonys girlfriend Pepper. Its going to take more than a Xanax to sort this all out. Its going to take Iron Man. But as skilled an engineer as Tony Stark is I wish hed turned his attention to a few other problems -- like misfires in the script and some awkward glitches in the characters. This movie has neither the emotionalism of the first film nor the flashy villains of the second. Of course the effects look great -- at this point in Marvel movies when dont the effects look great? Fans will also recognize most of the plot elements as being lifted from the series ""Extremis"" issues. (Purists however should be warned that the old iconic character of the Mandarin has been given a drastic twist.) The real problem though is that ""Iron Man 3"" -- which was written and directed by Shane Black best known for scripting four ""Lethal Weapon"" movies and the famously awful ""The Last Boy Scout"" -- tries too many things and sees too few of them through. Tonys relationship with girlfriend Pepper Potts is in inexplicable jeopardy -- and then simply fixes itself. A supposedly cute kid sidekick -- a true sign of authorial desperation -- is introduced and then dropped. And although the movie ends with a changed Iron Man (the movie almost plays like a goodbye to the series) theres no real evidence of it. Were told Tonys a different person but he doesnt seem to be. Casual fans will complain that Im asking a Marvel superhero movie to do too much. Actually Im only asking a Marvel superhero movie to do what the comic books already did and always have. Face it Marvels main characters are defined by their flaws and Tony Stark had as many as any of them including a self-destructive dependence on alcohol; the books dealt with that long ago head on. Here though his post-""Avengers"" trauma feels like an afterthought hastily added in the final draft of a script. Tony has a nightmare - but then no more. He has an outburst of anger perhaps two panic attacks -- and then they disappear. The movie is bright and loud with a thunderous climax and several great performances Ben Kingsley delivers a truly surprising one as the Mandarin and after being little more than a pair of legs and a notepad for two films its nice to see Gwyneth Paltrows Pepper really take charge. And Tony Starks prickly friendship with ""Rhodey"" Rhodes -- as played by Don Cheadle -- recalls some of the good-natured squabbling of Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in Blacks scripts for the ""Lethal Weapon"" franchise. But far too much of this movie -- like Tonys new toys -- is running on remote control. Ratings note The film contains violence. Iron Man 3 (PG-13) Paramount (130 min.) Directed by Shane Black. With Robert Downey Jr. Ben Kingsley Gwyneth Paltrow.

Neither actor steals the show but both are vital to the story and it feels like a very conscious choice on Blacks part to fill in the margins of his first Marvel tentpole as he sees fit. In a similar sense the writer behind ""Lethal Weapon"" and similar self-aware action-comedies (who has only otherwise directed 2005s perpetually underrated ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"") has taken the superhero-movie formula and tweaked it so as to better suit his own cheeky style and the result is a welcome continuation of -- if not a worthy conclusion to -- the ""Iron Man"" franchise. We pick up some time after the events of ""The Avengers"" with Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) publicly hailed as a hero but unable to sleep at night too deeply unnerved by the very existence of other threats from other worlds against which he might not be able to defend his loved ones -- namely Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). As such Starks arrogance has been tempered but the repercussions of his earlier more selfish behavior have resulted in the resurgence of both biotech pioneer Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) and genetic scientist Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall) and when a domestic campaign of terrorism led by a shadowy figure known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) hits too close to home Iron Man finds himself forced back into action. If it all sounds like so much familiar super-brooding worry not. Despite some unwitting parallels to recent Stateside bombings (not to mention a line of dialogue -- ""Nothings been the same since New York"" -- that invites certain real-world readings) the circumstances surrounding the Mandarins attacks remain distinctly fantastical and the overall tone is kept breezy. More than anything ""IM3"" is impressive for how comfortably it incorporates the usual Shane Black touchstones. Interracial team-up between Stark and buddy James Rhodes (Don Cheadle)? ""Lethal Weapon"" and ""The Long Kiss Goodnight."" A snappy but ultimately helpful little kid (Ty Simpkins)? ""The Last Boy Scout."" A ficus plant? ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang."" A detective story with a Christmastime setting henchmen mockery unfailingly pithy dialogue and a moderately meta voiceover? Pretty much all of the above. Yet none of that detracts from the usual comic-booky goods the hero moments and villain reveals and day-saving derring-do. Whether its the utter annihilation of our heros Malibu beach house a Tennessee bar brawl that sees a suitless Stark having to rely on his own wits for a change an attack on Air Force One or a shipyard showdown the action beats are often excitingly executed with expectedly impeccable effects and scene geography that is only occasionally lost in an editorial frenzy. The plot concocted between Black and co-writer Drew Pearce is fairly standard-issue in the end but the story itself benefits from a minimal preoccupation with setting up future Marvel movies and one particularly cheeky second-act gambit that echoes the directors usual Hollywood-set larks with surprising effectiveness. Downey Jr. remains a rightfully cherished smartass figure having as much a ball with Blacks one-liners as he had in ""KKBB"" and he sells Tonys newfound post-traumatic vulnerability more credibly than the film does. Paltrow gets to play Pepper as a figure finally fed up with a boyfriend more mindful of armor than amour and Cheadle is allotted a more sizeable amount of screen time with which to play off his partner in crime-stopping. Halls role is regrettably marginal and Pearces predictably unctuous but Kingsley clearly gets to relish his characters particular proclivities enough so to compensate for an otherwise routine endgame. A recurring motif in Shane Black films would be the matter of role-playing. A maniac gets to be an officer of the law; a super-spy thinks shes a stay-at-home mom; a petty thief is mistaken for an actor and in turn a private eye. Many a character here takes turns wearing Stark tech whether its one of many Iron Man suits or the militarized Iron Patriot outfit and either ""IM3"" is a Marvel movie in the guise of a Shane Black action-comedy or the other way around. Regardless its an awful lot of fun.

The inevitable franchise fatigue -- plus a markedly unmemorable villain -- may account for the feeling that ""Iron Man 3"" is more perfunctory and workmanlike than its two predecessors but this solid production still delivers more than enough of what fans expect to earn its weight in box office metal. Part of the rich appeal of the first ""Iron Man"" (2008) came from the inspired casting of Robert Downey Jr. who brought loads of impish charisma and insouciance to the part of defense contractor turned iron-plated superhero Tony Stark. It was particularly fun to watch Downey becoming Iron Man bobbing and weaving about in his space-age rocket suit like a novice surfer trying to stand up on a wave. You can only do an origin story once alas and some of the magic was already gone from 2010s ""Iron Man 2"" which pitted our hero against a stock Russian heavy (Mickey Rourke) in a standard-issue revenge narrative but still found ample time for Stark and romantic foil Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) to do their very passable Tracy-Hepburn routine. There was also a sly running commentary on the celebrification of American culture -- and in Starks effort to rid himself of the shrapnel slowly poisoning his body a deft analog for Downeys own widely publicized battle with various forms of addiction. Most of that is absent at the start of ""Iron Man 3"" which finds Stark in fine physical shape -- if a bit mentally unhinged from the events of ""The Avengers"" -- and living in relative domestic bliss with the comely Ms. Potts. All of which leaves little for Black (and co-screenwriter Drew Pearce) to do other than summon up the latest villain from the Marvel dugout A bearded bin Laden-esque baddie who calls himself the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) and who claims credit for a series of terror bombings one of which a frightening attack in front of Hollywoods historic Chinese Theatre has landed Stark security honcho Happy (Favreau) in a coma. (Although clearly unintentional the movies recurring images of severed limbs and burning bodies cant help but strike a queasy note in light of the recent events in Boston.) Spewing his boilerplate anti-American rhetoric in a series of crudely made videos that mysteriously jam the television airwaves the Mandarin promises that ""the big one is coming"" just in time for Christmas no less. <a href=""http//polldaddy.com/poll/7062251"">Take Our Poll</a> If weve learned anything from fantasy villains ranging from Darth Vader to the ""Dark Knight"" trilogys Ras al Ghul first appearances can be deceiving. Suffice to say that the Mandarin is in some kind of cahoots with a couple of blasts from Tony Starks past an experimental botanist (Rebecca Hall) and her wealthy benefactor Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) whose prize project Extremis involves ""hacking"" into the human DNA chain to cure the sick heal the lame and pretty much do anything else you might desire. Upon hearing Killians pitch Pepper notes that the technology sounds like it could easily be weaponized. She doesnt know the half of it. As an A-list screenwriter in the 80s and 90s Black practically defined a certain brand of sardonic Hollywood action spectacle (his credits include ""Lethal Weapon"" ""The Last Boy Scout"" and ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"") then disappeared for most of the 2000s surfacing briefly in 2005 with his directorial debut the self-referential neo-noir ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" (which featured Downey in a crucial comeback role). ""Iron Man 3"" reps a huge step up in terms of scale and Black largely acquits himself well keeping the pace brisk deploying a couple of modest surprises and staging a few undeniably impressive super-sized setpieces. Among them an end-of-first-act raid that reduces Starks swank Malibu pad to smithereens and a mid-film mid-air rescue that draws upon some truly spectacular skydiving acrobatics. SEE ALSO Iron Man 3 Premieres in Hollywood (Photos) The entire package is never less than professional enhanced by ace tech contributions from cinematographer John Toll production designer Bill Brzeski (replacing the late J. Michael Riva who designed the first two films) and editors Jeffrey Ford and Peter S. Elliot. Yet the movie suffers from separating Downey from three of his best verbal sparring partners -- Favreau Paltrow and Paul Bettany (as the voice of the uber-computer Jarvis) -- for much of the pics running time. And from top to bottom Favreaus handcrafted touch is conspicuously absent particularly his affection for retro Ray Harryhausen-esque visual effects. (This is by far the most digital-looking series entry.) Perhaps fittingly for a movie that introduces a new generation of remote-guided Iron Man suits ""Iron Man 3"" all too often feels as if it were assembled by a machine. Though advertised as ""Iron Man 3"" in all promotional materials the pics full onscreen title reads as ""Iron Man Three.""

Jamie says May 15 2013 at 956 pm I went 2 c it Friday and was very disappointed. And any real iron man comic fan would b and should b. they should of just called it tony stark Iron man was hardly in the movie And when he was he was getting his ass kicked I was really looking forward in seeing his number 1 villain of all time. Then I find out he wasnt even a real villain in the movie? Just a fake? Thats when the movie got worse 2 as it went on. How can marvel let down the true comic fans by making the mandrian fake? Why? He would of been a great villain 4 the movie but nooo They had 2 screw it up. And who was these people with the burning things or what ever they where? There not even in the comics At lease have a original villain I hope theres another one because that was the worse iron man of the three. U give it a 5 out of 10 and thats only Robert Downey played a good role. Very disappointed. ( Reply JonieJetsens says May 15 2013 at 412 pm Sabrina...if you need a job try this site JOBK3 com. My aunt makes 18.50 hourly just sitting and typing crap all day. And you dont need experience. Reply harold hill says May 14 2013 at 1121 pm I was disappointed by the movie. They really hyped it up and the previous movies were good but this was a flop. They really should have kept the movie within the same action plot and excitement level as the previous ones. This movie was boring at times not well written and I believe lost the Tony Stark unique personality. This Iron Man was not worth seeing. Just watch the trailers and save yourself a bunch of money. Reply Gregory Bland says May 10 2013 at 724 pm The movie was good not great. The fact the iron man suit can fly through the air in little pieces and reconstruct itself on Toney was to far fetched. Should have taken a step back here really just left it as the whole suit flying to him in one piece so he could climb in is much more believable. Crashed in burned with the Mandrian; missed opportunity with building a good villian. Seems like they took a civilian off the shelf of a James Bond movie.

Reply Jim says May 5 2013 at 808 am Digesting this over the last few days and reading the interviews to discern the ""thought"" process of what went into IM3 bottom-line after the success of the Avengers they decided to be ""relevant"" instead of entertaining and they wound up with crap. The problem is from what I read this is ""thought"" process will continue through to Avengers 2. But theyll ride the momentum and make another billion plus. To see such potential go to waste is maddening. Reply Joe says May 4 2013 at 807 pm Well if your a fan of cartoon or comics Mandarin is not even worth puting in this movie. No rings? No magic power? Was a waste of evening puting him this movie. Should of went with Hulk out of control and Iron Man using his Hulk-Buster armor to stop him. Reply hector says May 4 2013 at 551 am You critics and idiots have irrelevant reasons to say why tye movie isnt good. Just because it didnt go the way you wanted it. Well you faggots are nothing but haters. This is a great movie and variety is just mad no one reads their corny overrated reveiws you guys are played out just like the 40 year old virgin haters that follow you Reply John says May 4 2013 at 707 pm Why all of the hate hector? The review sounds mostly positive to me. I enjoyed the movie but it is in no way perfect. Id probably give it a 7.5 or 8 out of 10. Reply Paul says May 3 2013 at 716 pm Just saw IM3 and I must say it was extremely disappointing. I grew up reading the comics as a teen in the 70s and to portray Mandarin as a joke is a massive ""screw up"". In my opinion Shane Black whose movies are mediocre - at best - pulled the entire Marvel franchise down a notch. The entire revival of the Marvel movies was hinged upon IM and it just dropped in stature. I want to see action as the 1 thing in these types of movies with character development as a subplot. It worked in the first two Just very disappointing. All of the posts that state they love the more developed character plot with less action and not true to Marvel universe story lines - if you truly want to watch a show that is touchy-feely - stay home and watch Terms of Endearment. The majority of fans - particularly Marvel fans that grew up with the original comic stories/characters - want to relax and get away from everyday life by watching an action packed blockbuster. Reply hector says May 4 2013 at 553 am How about you shut the fuck up you pussy Reply jmont says May 6 2013 at 833 am dumb gang banger wannabee beaner. social parasite ""Hector"" that gives all decent Mexicans a bad name. You dont know the guy your trashing but we can pretty much pin you down in a new york minute by the fact you cannot take any critique of your precious movie you had nothing to do with as well. Jim says May 3 2013 at 446 pm ""...from top to bottom Favreaus handcrafted touch is conspicuously absent..."" this is without a doubt the core of the many problems with this film. Starting with the not so subtle smack in the face that terrorists are essentially boogeymen of our own creation is exceptionally painful in light of the murder of eight-year-old Martin Richard by jihadist in Boston. The Ten Rings wonton lust for blood and conquest failed to appear anywhere. Why? Can we no longer depict the almost daily carnage of jihadist anymore? I see plenty of it in the headlines. Iron Man was successful because it took the original story and simple placed it in present day. Shane Black clearly lacks any attachment to this concept. And the ingenuity of Stark is now a liability literally a weight he winds up dragging through the snow(by the way who in their right mind would believe Stark would NOT be prepared for an attack short of a nuke at his base of operations he is a genius after all) The character of the Mandarin and the absolute malevolent portrayal by Ben Kingsley were wasted. There could have been so much that could have been done with this legendary conflict between he and Stark but this was (and will always be) ""Shanes Iron Man"" a pale imitation of ""...Favreaus handcrafted..."" creations that preceded and that were so well integrated successfully into Whedons Avengers. Reply hector says May 4 2013 at 555 am Jim your a fucking idiot. You took your time to write all of this. And yet your still at home being an anti social virgin that has nothing better to do then critic a movie that you have no part of. Your just mad this movie is actually a success unlike you. Jealous faggot Reply Kari says May 16 2013 at 409 am And you have nothing better to do than to rudely critique other peoples well thought out opinions on the movie? Who is the true person who doesnt have time on their hands. You sound like a typical internet ""Troll"" to me. And where do trolls live? Probably in a hole somewhere. Im also assuming you are very young. Probably a child who uses the internet as a way to hide behind a mask to make unnecessary remarks to other people. Youre probably bullied or dont have many friends (or many good friends). Maybe you have a rough life. You would probably only reply to this with more hatefulness but you should realize this is not the right thing to do. You need to realize this is not how you for meaningful bonds with anyone or how you treat other people. I would also have to agree with Jim and many other posters. Iron Man 3 was good to watch but it just didnt feel like I was watching an Iron Man movie. It is because they changed directors and that can really change the total feel of a movie. In this case it was no for the best. jmont says May 6 2013 at 828 am ""Hector"" you just angry because you are actually the anti social idiotic loser you accuse others of being. so mad people dont blindly love your precious movie aww cant take it you lame fanboy. stay home and beat off to your iron man poster again Hector jmont says May 6 2013 at 821 am shut up and go back to Mexico beaner Joshua says May 1 2013 at 1156 pm Im a bit upset with the twist but about maybe 45 minutes in I started to figure it out. That said it was a good movie. Reply Cliffhanger77 says May 1 2013 at 814 pm Sorry but IM3 is the BEST Iron Man by far Max and other haters. The comic-book fanboys (hint - learn to spell you guys -- youll get your points across more effectively) are all in a tizz over the changes in Mandarin. You know what - Mandarin in the comic books was a racist yellow-peril stereotype of the worst sort. Kudos to the filmmakers for changing him brilliantly (and who could play him better than Ben Kingsley?) and for the surprises that are in store for filmgoers in this movie. I loved it and although I would watch Downey in anything I have always found his Tony Stark portrayal to be one of his most layered and compelling roles. Its too bad that some critics (and the Oscars) tend to downplay actors in ""comic book movies"" as somehow having ""lesser"" or less challenging roles than those who play protagonists in small critical-darling dramas. Downeys Tony Stark and the Bruce Wayne of the Dark Knight movies are titanic multi-layered roles and deserve critical acclaim and award nominations. Sorry fanboys - I dont want to see yet another Iron Man with guys in iron suits clanking around and bashing each other -- that does not appeal. I prefer the exploration of Tonys personal flaws that we get in IM3 - and the sort of real heroism that comes from rising above human challenges and finding the strength inside to go on. IM3 delivers that AND a slam-bang storyline -- thank you to all involved in creating it Reply Jim says May 3 2013 at 450 pm ...Berkley? Reply ericdpitts says May 1 2013 at 945 pm WoW you must be great to have around 300. IFit were real IT wouldint be so great but its somebodys interpitation of a great story. zerczes wasent to fonny now was he. ooo well im drunk and going to sleep but they could have done lot better i think stick to some comic boooook truth soo kids can ask qustions and ill know what the fuck there talking about too much fucking change yes the manderin is not a pot head boy HAHAHA Reply ericdpitts says May 1 2013 at 851 pm downy is great but im not looking for clean clothes. im looking for a more clean to the facts story of comic book leagend that illistrates comic book greatness. not comic releaf through the untrue vision of someone else. Thats why its not the same as we know to be great witch is IRON MAN not a new version Reply Max says April 30 2013 at 751 pm The worst Iron man by far yes you heard me Shane Black wants this to be Lethal Weapon 2 and a half with downey running around shooting guns its outrages that he was allowed to work on this project ill take Iron man 2 over this crap anyday. Yep theyve pulled another spidey 3 way to go fuck it all up for the fans dickheads Reply ericdpitts says April 30 2013 at 432 am iI they dont even know that the madarin is a powerful true villan from the comic books. not a fake they should let somebody who duz ha ha. i cant belive marvel let them release it sad truly sad Reply Shazzer says April 28 2013 at 949 pm Didnt hurt that the studio also payed People magazine for Gwyneth to be named ""Most Disgusting (I mean) Beautiful Woman"" to hype it either. Reply Jigar Doshi says April 28 2013 at 958 am My review of the movie Iron Man 3  robert impresses yet again. http//jigar-doshi.com/2013/04/iron-man-3-move-review/ Reply bstolemyremote says April 28 2013 at 315 am Definitely agree that the film is solid in terms of action and Downey Jrs performance the motivations of the villains felt incredibly underwhelming. In our review we also take issue with how little dramatic impact the identity issues (stemming from The Avengers fall-out) has. It feels like they go back to it repeatedly but it never really amounts to anything. Its like an anchor around the films neck each time it comes up. Reply Phil says April 27 2013 at 1030 am I am a fan of Iron Man but not a fan of ""3"" Shane Black has made Iron Man as soft as Tin Cans... Since when do we remember that when a truck hit iron man... It break into pieces?? And the rocket attack...what??? The armor wasnt even hit directly and it blew like a fire works?? Shame Shame Shame thats the ""3"" that i will remember. Reply Kike says April 26 2013 at 1139 pm Mandarin is the first enemy of iron man his personality is like a guru genghis khan like rahs al guhl but the director put this character like a clown and compare to bin laden mandarin is from china the rings is better than the weapon of aldrich is for people who didnt know about comic fans comics we born with 60 series this movie has many parts but nothing with esence. Reply See Hui Chyr says April 26 2013 at 1007 pm Big disappointment in the movie. IF you are a true comic buff ull know what I mean. Not gonna reveal it here coz itll be a spoiler. Reply Tom says April 26 2013 at 144 am I didnt realize that ""Iron Man 3"" and ""Iron Man Three"" were different things. Reply Mark says April 26 2013 at 1234 am Man...if you dont want to write dont. If you have seen all three movies you will have to be able to say that it was far out the best of the three. This is one fun action filled Layer Cake. Yes it has more silly fun in it than any of the previous. But I can say for sure (having seen almost all Marvel movies except for Thor) Iron Man has been the best comic-movie translation and this iteration has surpassed it. Perhaps it is due to nationality some like it or not. Likely age has to do with it. I grew up with the Iron Man from Jim Lee Romita Jr. and John Byrne not the recent reruns. I can say This is the first movie that got a full and crowded cinema with all nationalities and ages laughing and feeling (watch the speed Not the face again) more than 5 times on a Marvel action movie. So No this is for sure not the worse. If anybody wants to explain which Marvel movie is better (and why) please by all means Reply ENOCH ALLEN says April 29 2013 at 407 pm When talking about the greatest comic book films Spiderman 2 always gets neglected. For my money Spidey 2 is also one of Sam Raimis career best movies. Reply Iron Man says April 25 2013 at 828 pm how much spoilers man i don`t like it at all. Reply HBKRULES says April 25 2013 at 548 pm By far the worst Iron man film infact worst marvel film since electra and dare devil a total disapointment to true marvel comic fans. Reply ericdpitts says April 30 2013 at 441 am your absolutly right they need some insight from true comic fans then they might get it right. Reply Rory says April 25 2013 at 1109 am Im hoping the Madarin being in cahoots with Rebecca Hall and Guy Pearces characters is revealed early and not a third act revelation that youve now ruined for everyone. Reply Scott Foundas says April 25 2013 at 1112 am Less than 30 minutes in. Rest easy. The ""surprise"" about The Mandarin is not revealed in this review. Reply odum says April 25 2013 at 1010 am Hmm. Nice name-drop on the ""Ray Harryhausen-esque visual""s but even in my broadest imaginative calisthenics I cant imagine what you mean or how such a description fits or applies in any way. Clearly you dont mean the tech so you must mean - I dunno - the framing? Even then I see no points of comparison at all. Could you elaborate? Reply Scott Foundas says April 25 2013 at 1055 am I think you can find Harryhausen references in nearly all of Favreaus movies most explicitly in ""Elf"" and the little-seen but very charming ""Zathura"" but also in the ""Iron Man"" films. Case in point Justin Hammers drone army attacking the expo at the end of ""Iron Man 2"" has a distinctly ""Jason and the Argonauts"" vibe about it. Also the general attention paid to making sure the effects even when computer-generated maintained a physical tactile presence in the scenes. One could also mention one of Harryhausens great disciples Phil Tippet whose extraordinary work on the original ""Star Wars"" and ""Robocop"" films can be seen as another influence on Favreau. Reply odum says April 26 2013 at 523 am Okay. I can kinda see all that. Not sure Im with you but Im not scratching my head anymore. Thanks. George Valentin says April 25 2013 at 529 am Im wondering how good the 3D effects are in ""Iron Man Three."" Reply George Valentin says April 25 2013 at 1000 am Thank you Scott for replying to my question. Reply Scott Foundas says April 25 2013 at 755 am Unremarkable. It is a post-production conversion and it shows. See it in 2D and you will miss little but keep a few extra dollars in your wallet.

Reply Johnny says April 27 2013 at 416 pm The Mandarin is just a pussy in this film. That is the biggest disappointment. He is a comic relief... an actor pretending to be a terrorist.

TWITTER Robert Downey Jr. Gwyneth Paltrow Ben Kingsley and Don Cheadle star in Marvel Studios ""Avengers"" followup. After nearly crashing and burning on his last solo flight in 2010 Iron Man returns refreshed and ready for action in this spirited third installment of the thus-far 1.2 billion-grossing Marvel franchise. In a way a double-sequel both to Iron Man 2 and to last years mega-hit The Avengers Iron Man 3 benefits immeasurably from the irreverent quicksilver humor of co-writer and director Shane Black whose obvious rapport with Robert Downey Jr. in his only other directorial outing Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is further manifest here. Brandishing at least a couple of killer twists this Disney release (having taken over from co-presenter Paramount) will be the (early) summers first massive hit both in overseas openings beginning April 24 and upon domestic launch May 3. PHOTOS Iron Man 3 Tour Robert Downey Jr. Travels the World Too long gone from the film scene Black who made his mark with the initial Lethal Weapon script takes this assignment both very seriously and not seriously at all which is entirely in tune with the glib determination Downey has always brought to the role of Tony Stark. The star executes almost continual verbal pirouettes barking out sardonic quips and rejoinders even in moments of greatest distress but due to his exceptional lingual dexterity it rarely gets old and never seems condescending to the admittedly cartoonish context. By extension this giddy double-edged approach extends to many of the other characters. The good-guy leads Tony Stark/Iron Man and Col. Rhodes/War Machine (Don Cheadle) have two incarnations and its not giving too much away to say that they are far from the only ones here who have double personalities. Black and his co-screenwriter first-timer Drew Pearce have great fun reshuffling the deck teasing about who might occupy what superhero suit and morphing the story along with identity revelations and expansions of the dramatic horizons; the well-chosen cast members respond in kind with virtually palpable glee. PHOTOS 10 Top Summer Superheroes Movies Of All Time After an enticing prologue in which Tony spends New Years Eve 1999 in Switzerland well matched with the fetching Maya (Rebecca Hall) while brushing off the professional entreaties of weird fellow scientist Aldrich Killian (a semi-disguised Guy Pearce) the current day finds the wealthy world savior in retrenching mode in the bowels of his Malibu mansion fussing with updates of his Iron Man gear while lady love Pepper Potts runs the show at Stark Industries. Subject to anxiety attacks and unable to sleep Tony cant even be bothered with a series of world bombings and grave further threats from a Bin Laden-type terrorist The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) a variation on an early Iron Man comics villain who is insidiously adept at commandeering world broadcasting and the internet. For her part Pepper is approached by Killian now transformed into a dashingly handsome think tank genius who seeks Starks involvement in Extremis an alleged mind-projection breakthrough. For unexplained reasons she turns him down cold. In an upsetting sequence that cuts far too close to home in the wake of the recent Boston bombings Hollywoods famed Chinese Theater forecourt is the scene of what appears to be a bombing but turns out to be something else an attack by human beings whose eyes begin to glow scarily before their bodies heat to to the point of explosion. Starks security chief (played by Jon Favreau director of the first two series installments) is among the badly injured while the ever-resourceful Tony recognizes a similarity to an attack previously made in Tennessee. At first then it appears that the strategy behind Iron Man 3 will be to bring chilling real-world dangers to Tony Starks doorstep in a more immediate and realistic way than ever before. In fact the enemy literally does come to his door in the form of a merciless helicopter attack on his oceanside home that entirely destroys it. Initially presumed dead he then materializes in Tennessee where a bright orphan (an engaging Ty Simpkins) helps him connect the dots between the earlier local incident and recent events which soon are followed up by the emergence of more red-hot Extremisites. Refreshingly Black amp; Co. upend sentimental expectations by having Tony blow off the kid when hes done with him just as the ante is upped beyond mere contemporary relevance by some major surprises--one of them at the 75-minute mark quite startlingly funny--that shoot the film up to an entirely different level of screwy humor and large-canvas spectacle. The latter includes a beautifully rendered free fall sequence in which an Iron Man zooms down to assemble 13 people who have been blown out of Air Force One into an airborne daisy chain and guides them to a safe landing while the climax takes full nocturnal visual advantage of a giant mechanized shipping port. VIDEO Iron Man 3 Clip Debuts During MTV Movie Awards Although its moderately creepy the Extremis phenomenon of flammable humans is probably the least appealing element here as it provokes memories of vaguely cheesy werewolf eyes and Dr. Phibes-like flesh effects. Peppers constant complaining about Tony not being there for her also strike somewhat old-fashioned neglected mate notes but otherwise Black and Pearce devote themselves more with success than not to generating surprise injecting wit into rote situations and outfitting the franchise with a sharp new set of attitudes not to mention outfits. Looking if anything younger than he did in his last couple of spins for Marvel Downey is at his superhero genius best here rattling off dialogue both clever and boilerplate with non-repetitive aplomb. Clearly part of the thinking behind this installment was to have Tony spend much of his time out of his Iron Man suit and force him to generate creative rather than just physical ways to solve problems and this gives the actor more opportunities than he had in the second go-round. Halls offbeat presence in what is her first big-budget franchise outing is greatly welcome Pearce brings an arresting presence to his role as an egghead villain and a fabulously accoutered and adorned Kingsley has a field day as the elusive Mandarin. PHOTOS 30 Groundbreaking Sci-Fi Films Cinematographer John Toll and production designer Bill Brzeski add class to the generic proceedings Brian Tylers ultra-energetic score doesnt grate the way soundtracks for such films often do and the special and visual effects are tops when they count. After 10 minutes of end credits the usual Marvel tag-on scene amusingly shows Tony on a shrinks couch being tended to by one of the actors from The Avengers. A final note promises that Tony Stark will be back although whether only in the next Avengers or in another Iron Man is not made clear. That will be for Downey and his agent to decide.

In the minus column theres the tedious talky first act the scripts uneasy attempts at psychological realism Gwyneth Paltrows increasingly shrill and redundant Pepper Potts and Robert Downey Jrs disastrously smarmy David Gest-like facial furniture. But theyre balanced out by a handful of punchy one-liners courtesy of Lethal Weapon scribe Shane Black a loveable old-school Joe Dante-ish small-town-USA central section and a sprawling cast of reliable supporting players including Rebecca Hall Guy Pearce Miguel Ferrer and the great William Sadler. Towering above them all is Ben Kingsley as one of comic book cinemas most astonishing and unlikely supervillains. We find Tony Stark (Downey Jr) languishing in the doldrums scarred by his experiences with the alien-battling Avengers and throwing himself into work at the expense of relationships and sleep. Whats worse theres a terrorist on the loose mystery man the Mandarin (Kingsley) bent on global annihilation. After an ill-advised public throwdown followed by a helicopter attack on his plush seafront palace Tony heads for Tennessee on the trail of a seemingly suicidal ex-soldier and quickly learns that nothing here is at it seems... Despite his unimpeachable screenwriting CV this is only Blacks second film as a director (his first 2005s gloriously foul-mouthed crime thriller Kiss Kiss Bang Bang also starred Downey Jr) and it shows. When hes in his element Black delivers the goods in style as in the scenes between Downey Jr and his temporary pre-pubescent sidekick Harley (Ty Simpkins) or a hilarious mid-film switcheroo which may prove the summer seasons most jawdroppingly memorable moment. But he seems out of his depth during the larger set pieces the action sequences are busy and confusing especially the misjudged threat-free climax. The result is a film which never settles into a comfortable groove. It tries to be an angsty Dark Knight-style game changer an 80s-throwback action romp a nudge-wink pastiche and a CG-fuelled spectacular. Its undeniably entertaining - and worth seeing for Kingsley alone - with the misfires never fully overshadowing the moments of glory. But in the wake of the triumph of The Avengers Iron Man 3 still feels like something of a disappointment.
