Thats the challenge that ultimately derails ""Looney Tunes Back in Action"" a not-inventive-enough romp that belches out gags at a rapid-fire clip. Madcap comedy is harder than it looks especially when the task involves stretching what normally plays as a controlled burst into feature length. Thats the challenge that ultimately derails ""Looney Tunes Back in Action"" a not-inventive-enough romp that belches out gags at a rapid-fire clip but connects so sporadically as to leave the audience enervated but only sparingly entertained. While seeing some of the Looney Tunes characters is always fun and pic is diverting enough for small fry adult appeal is limited which should inhibit box office amid a spate of pre-holiday releases aimed at the family crowd. Director Joe Dantes love affair with Warner Bros. cartoons has been evident since ""Gremlins"" and his portion of ""Twilight Zone The Movie"" and he clearly brings considerable enthusiasm to this blend of live-action and animation. Even what might be called his repertory company -- Dick Miller Kevin McCarthy and director Roger Corman -- tags along for the ride. Yet redundant as it might sound for a project that showcases good ol 2-D cell animation for the most part ""Looney Tunes"" comes across as flat as Wile E. Coyote after a boulder lands on him unable to sustain the merriment better encapsulated in a six-minute cartoon format. Moreover its been 15 years since ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" with similarly themed fare such as ""Space Jam"" and ""Scooby Doo"" in between. So with the novelty of seeing Bugs Bunny Daffy Duck and their resilient brethren interact with flesh-and-bone actors relatively old hat the story requires more giggles -- and not just the odd knowing smile -- than Dante and Larry Doyle (the one credited writer) deliver. The premise again involves a world where animated characters live alongside human counterparts with Bugs and Daffy representing two of the Warner Brothers (played by twins Don and Dan Stanton) contract players. The studios icy VP of comedy Kate (Jenna Elfman) decides to fire Daffy ordering studio guard DJ (Brendan Fraser) to eject him. When that process goes spectacularly wrong she fires DJ who ends up with Daffy on the road to Vegas trying to rescue his dad (a self-spoofing Timothy Dalton) -- another Warner Bros. star who in fact is a secret agent. With Kate realizing shes made a mistake she and Bugs pursue them to woo Daffy back. Quickly reunited the quartet ends up on a series of adventures trying to thwart a plot by Mr. Chairman (Steve Martin) head of the Acme Corp. the unfortunate outfit from which Wile E. has been acquiring those ineffectual weapons of missed destruction all these years. ""Looney Tunes"" aspires to play on two levels delighting kids with mayhem while adults are supposed to laugh at the loving movie parodies and Hollywood references. Certainly a ""Psycho"" homage is unlikely to be fully appreciated around the playground any more than a glimpsed photo of Daffy with Richard Nixon and Bob Hope. The films pace and volume however are a bit too relentless for adults with not enough of the kind of inspired bits they can truly appreciate -- including Bugs and Daffy leaping into and out of paintings in the Louvre or Porky Pig and Speedy Gonzalez lamenting a modern world of political correctness. As for kids theres certainly plenty of action but few of the jokes reach the heights of zaniness likely to completely satisfy them. Thats the case despite a technical proficiency that wont be fully appreciated in part because it looks so effortless. From the fluid animation (complete with shadows that add dimension to the cartoon characters) to some of the elaborate stunts and computer-generated constructs -- with a parade of monsters at a secret government facility tapping into Dantes love of 50s sci-fi -- this is a deftly realized world. Yet like Lucys conveyor belt of confections most of it zooms by too fast to take in. Cinematographer Dean Cundey worked on ""Roger Rabbit"" and if this doesnt feel like another leap forward as the production notes proclaim its still a well-articulated vision -- augmented to the extent it can be by the always reliable Jerry Goldsmiths score. As for the real-life actors theyre not surprisingly a bit overwhelmed by their co-stars. Martin at least gamely gets into the spirit (his voice sounds vaguely reminiscent of a ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch) despite having precious little material with which to work and limited screen time. Fraser meanwhile adds to his cartoon portfolio after ""George of the Jungle"" ""Dudley Do-Right"" and ""Monkeybone"" (its a long way back to ""Gods and Monsters"") while Elfman has yet to parlay her charming ""Dharma amp; Greg"" persona beyond a roster of forgettable films. Dantes passion regarding Warner Bros. is well known including past cameos for the late animation legend Chuck Jones. Yet that creative flair has frequently given way to off-putting excess -- perhaps best exemplified by ""Twilight Zone"" and ""Explorers"" a film where visiting aliens arrive and all they can do is parrot old TV shows. ""Whos laughing now?"" Martins Mr. Chairman bellows at one point in ""Looney Tunes"" striking a bit too close to home by following up with ""Apparently no one"" The film isnt quite that bad but like an Acme product its headlong pursuit of laughs too often misses the intended target.

"Bugs as Groucho Marx in Looney Tunes. Slate Sign In Sign Up Bugs as Groucho Marx in Looney Tunes. Bugs as Groucho Marx in Looney Tunes. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 14 2003 530 PM Wabbit Season Bugs and Daffy reclaim past glory in Looney Tunes Back in Action. By David Edelstein Thumbs up doc There was this critic at a screening of Looney Tunes Back in Action (Warner Bros.) the new live-action and animated Bugs and Daffy feature who was complaining that the movie ""cannibalized"" the great Warner Bros. cartoon tradition--which made me wish that Bugs Bunny were there to say ""What a maroon."" In the first place buster its hard to cannibalize a tradition that began life by cannibalizing everything in sight pious Disney cartoons grand operas symphonies literary classics Hollywood movies. In the second the film has been directed written and animated by people who were weaned on Bugs Daffy Duck Elmer Fudd the Road Runner etc. and who fought like Tazmanian Devils to keep that free-for-all spirit in a 100-millon-plus studio ""tent pole."" In the third place Looney Tunes Back inAction is a nutty zany wacky unruly spastically hilarious hodgepodge that hits at least twice as often as it misses--which is a big deal since there are more gags per square foot of celluloid than in any film since Joe Dantes Gremlins 2 The New Batch (1990). Advertisement As it happens Dante is at the helm of this one too--hired at the instigation of former Simpsons writer Larry Doyle who wrote the original screenplay and executive-produced a bunch of (as yet unreleased) Looney Tunes shorts before leaving the studio in disgust last winter over ""creative differences."" (""Theyre dethpicable"" he did not say.) Dante meanwhile came up against executives who were nervous about the characters ""breaking the fourth wall""--i.e. addressing the audience and thus ""throwing them out of the movie."" As Bugs Bunny might put it ""What imbeciles."" There was rarely a fourth wall in a Warner cartoon--that was the point. Luckily for us (and Bugs and Daffy who werent seen at their finest in the last Warner feature the embarrassing Space Jam [1996]) Dante and his animators won the major battles. Teams of gag writers would periodically review the footage of live actors and think of more quips for the cartoon characters to interject Jokes were being animated as recently as six weeks ago while sound people were busy sprucing things up with their own boinks and bonks and burps. This background stuff is important because Looney Tunes Back in Action is best thought of as something like an old Marx Brothers musical--the ones that came together on the road with people like George S. Kaufman and S.J. Perelman (not to mention Groucho and Harpo and Chico and Zeppo and Gummo) who threw in any gag they could think of to keep the rickety plot in motion. (Dante is a big fan of a similar anything-goes comedy classic Olsen and Johnsons Hellzapoppin [1941].) The picture hurtles out of the starting gate with a variation on an old Chuck Jones classic (the one about rabbit-hunting season) then segues into a montage in which Daffy is incessantly shot smashed and flattened--at which point the duck hurls down a bunch of scripts in disgust. Hes sitting in a boardroom at the Warner Bros. studio Hes sick he fumes of being pummeled for laughs while Bugs Bunny the star saunters away unhurt; besides he says violence in cartoons sets a bad example for children. Its likely that Daffy is shot smashed flattened and exploded more often in the next 80 minutes than in all of his shorts put together--once even by cartoon characters who worry that theyre setting a bad example for children. Fired by studio VP Kate Houghton (Jenna Elfman) and informed that he no longer even owns his own name Daffy follows home a hapless security guard named DJ (Brendan Fraser) who sometimes works as a stuntman for Brendan Fraser (Brendan Fraser) and is also the son of the studios biggest star Damien Drake (Timothy Dalton). It turns out that Drake is actually a secret agent off screen as well as on and has been kidnapped by the nefarious Mr. Chairman (Steve Martin) of the Acme Corp. who is desperate to get his hands on a diamond with mysterious powers ""The Blue Monkey""--or as Martin pronounces it ""Monk-ehhhh."" To recount too many of the jokes would be a crime Part of the fun is how fast they come at you and how fast they whiz by--most of them aimed squarely at grown-ups (for whom the Warner cartoons were originally intended) but with enough slapstick oomph for kids to love them too. The human-toon intercourse is dizzying Cartoon characters leap into painted backdrops that humans crash through. And in a sequence in the Louvre Elmer chases Bugs and Daffy through some of the worlds most famous paintings--and suddenly we get the Salvador Dali Bugs and Daffy the Edvard Munch Bugs and Daffy the Georges Seurat Bugs and Daffy. Treating Bugs and Daffy as movie stars and Fudd Wile E. Coyote Taz and Yosemite Sam as real-world villains doesnt undermine their shtick--in fact the new context makes it fresher and funnier. Once in a while theres even a bit of nightmarish poetry as when Elfmans Kate regards one of Yosemite Sams goons with horror as hes poised to toss a stick of dynamite into her car. ""Dynamite???"" she says. ""Who uses dynamite???"" ""Welcome to my world"" says Daffy with the sad fatalism of one who has grown accustomed to being blown up. Its a good thing that there are constant injections of helium because Dantes direction of the live actors can be a little flat. The compositions are often (maybe by necessity given the difficulty of adding cartoons) one-dimensional and the pacing goes disastrously slack in a sequence set in a Las Vegas casino owned by Yosemite Sam. (The only thing that saves it is a brilliantly staged and animated barroom brawl between Fraser and a succession of burly cartoon characters.) Dante wastes his familiar stock company (Dick Miller Mary Woronov Robert Picardo etc.) and he cant get anything funny out of Elfman who just pulls faces. But Fraser is as always likably game; his rubberiness in this context seems a mark of soul. And there are lots of goosey cameo appearances from Joan Cusack (who gets to do a spit take) to Batman to Robby the Robot. Steve Martin moreover is a miracle. Determined not to be upstaged by his flamboyant Warner costars he has concocted a ""supertwit"" that is at times at least their equal. His red hair parted in the middle he staggers around the set in sneakers and an ill-fitting suit jerking his torso windmilling his arms--stopping his gyrations only to saunter up to one of several repulsed women convinced that he is catnip to the ladies. This is the old Steve Martin the whirligig genius of The Jerk (1979) The Man With Two Brains (1983) and All of Me (1984). To see him this way after at least a decade of domesticated dreck is to love all the more the liberating influence of Warner Bros. cartoons. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

"Looney Tunes Daffy Genius washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Looney Tunes Daffy Genius Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday November 14 2003 Th-th-thats not all folks. Th-th-theres more. ""Looney Tunes Back in Action"" the crazed and wonderful continuation of the great Warner Bros. cartoon tradition at feature film budget and length is delightful delicious and destructive. It makes one indisputable point rich in philosophical and political meaning a vast epiphany that we ought to all every last one of us understand and memorize Its Daffy Ducks world and were just visiting. Mr. Duck is in fine form and his considerable intelligence informs and illuminates ""Looney Tunes""; moreover its wonderful to watch him relate with his co-star Bugs Bunny. Redford/Newman Matthau/Lemmon Laurel/Hardy Duck/Bunny -- we are talking fabulous screen pairings the exquisite instinctive pas de deux of ego as reflected in sublime comic timing physical awareness and interspecies mind-meld. As for the humans in the cast -- hmmm were there any? Oh yes if memory serves Brendan Fraser has a good-hearted lark as the lunky D.J. Drake a wanna-be stuntman who was formerly Brendan Frasers stand-in but was fired by Brendan Fraser for getting too much screen time in ""The Mummy"" (thats typical of this films inside-movies sensibility). Then theres Jenna Elfman who looks like Ann Coulter chilled on Prozac. Shes a studio exec -- the ""vice president of comedy"" -- who fires Duck and then when the new Bunny film just doesnt seem to work must rehire him for the Brothers Warner (played by the identical Stanton twins Don and Dan who were respectively an asylum guard and his T-2000 duplicate in the twin-rich ""Terminator 2 Judgment Day."") But Duck has vanished. Actually hes headed off to Vegas with Drake to rescue Drakes father the movie actor and spy Damien Drake (Timothy Dalton) who has been kidnapped by agents of Acme Corp. an evil corporation headed by psycho CEO Mr. Chairman (Steve Martin) who . . . Well a watched plot never boils so lets let this one simmer away as it morphs into a completely meaningless parody of a globe-hopping lesser Bond picture. The primary virtue of ""Looney Tunes Back in Action"" is the dexterity with which it captures the spirit of the great Warner Bros. cartoons of the 40s and 50s wherein the director-animator Chuck Jones the preeminent Bunny and Duck auteur (Mel Blanc just did the voices) really invented the cartoon as narrative-busting frame-shattering gravity-defying bomb. He brought a spirit to the flickers that could only be expressed in one word anarchy. That impulse toward helter-skelter an oft-troubling thing representative of the nihilism the bitterly disconnected feel toward the world about them does have its uses but almost none of them is political. In the context of the animated film it is a most wondrous force. As director Joe Dante (no stranger to anarchy -- ""Gremlins"" was his great hit) unleashes it it destroys everything and makes us laugh all the time. Thus at its best ""Looney Tunes"" is a hymn to chaos and Duck and Bunny its high priests. These boys can wreck anything and have a good time doing it. To see them loose in the Louvre that citadel of the permanent the valuable the sacred and the perfect is priceless. As animated creatures they are free to enter the paintings on the wall and within those paintings to absorb those painters styles. To see a cartoon icon screaming next to Edvard Munchs iconic yellow-green wailer on that bridge in a duet of angst is a pure fabulous toot. And we get the following delirious spectacle a pointillist Bugs being pursued through ""Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte"" by a pointillist Elmer Fudd amid women in bustles and monkeys on leashes and lounging dogs and French-looking guys in weird jockey hats. Somewhere Georges Seurat is spinning in his grave but I know of a guy who grew up with a copy of that painting hanging in his living room who hasnt stopped laughing. Another gambit gets the characters to Area 52 which as someone explains is the real top-secret research site in the Nevada desert; Area 51 was merely the cover story. Anyhow in this place they come across and are eventually attacked by a fleet of cheap 50s movie monsters including the guy in the gorilla suit wearing the divers helmet. Why even a black-and-white Kevin McCarthy carrying a pod and screaming ""Theyre coming"" wanders in seemingly straight off the set of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers."" The movie is made technically possible by computer-generated imagery which enables -- as in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" -- the animated characters to acquire depth weight and substance. In olden days combining the animated and the real never quite worked because the dimensionality was strikingly different Here Mr. Bunny and Mr. Duck can occupy the same space as Mr. Fraser and Ms. Elfman in a totally captivating illusion. It seems real in the movie sense -- that is as if you are watching a photographed document. But possibly the true genius behind this movie is an old-fashioned kind of genius That would be the writers. Larry Doyle gets animated humor and timing to an exquisite degree possibly honed by all his years writing for ""The Simpsons"" and ""King of the Hill."" He brilliantly works in fabled figures from the Warner canon including Tweety Bird and Sylvester Pepe Le Pew and of course that Sysyphian figure of futility Wile E. Coyote who as he must continually disappoints his employer Mr. Chairman. Doyle and Dante are clearly guys who get the sound and the fury of the Looney Tunes world and were all the better off for it. Looney Tunes Back in Action (95 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for cartoon violence.

Starring Brendan Fraser Jenna Elfman Steve Martin. Directed by Joe Dante. (PG. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters). Acting opposite cartoon characters isnt easy. Even Michael Jordan looked slightly uncool in ""Space Jam."" So the human stars of ""Looney Tunes Back in Action"" -- Brendan Fraser Jenna Elfman and Steve Martin -- started out with a handicap. Only Fraser overcame it bridging the gap between humans and cartoons so smoothly that we hardly notice the cinematic species merge. He and Bugs Bunny are the highlights of this pleasant but unoriginal film. Whether children will like this film rests on a couple of conditions. First they have to be capable in an era of sophisticated video-game story lines of still getting excited about old-fashioned cartoon characters being pummeled pancaked and blown to bits. ""Back in Action"" might dress up its cartoon violence with live-action characters but the crux of the film varies little from the Looney Tunes cartoons of 50 years ago. One must also be a fan of Daffy Ducks to enjoy the picture. He and not the incomparable Bugs gets the most screen time. For me Daffys lisping raspy complaints grew tiresome rather quickly. But then they always did. Like Christopher Walken Daffy is a big presence best enjoyed in small doses. In what amounts to an extended promo for Warner Bros. ""Back in Action"" starts at studio headquarters. A company executive (Elfman) has fired Daffy for his impertinence then canned a sweet security guard (Fraser) for failing to catch and eject the fowl superstar. The chase scene on the studio back lot offers minor amusements like the toppling of the famous ""WB"" water tower and subsequent soaking of studio personnel. Thankfully the in-house plugs give way to a globe-hopping espionage plotline more in keeping with the Looney Tunes franchise. Frasers character happens to be the son of the studios biggest star (Timothy Dalton spoofing his Bond image). Dad a spy offscreen as well as on has been kidnapped by the evil head of the Acme Corp. (Martin). Daffy joins the sons rescue effort with Bugs and the studio executive following in a bid to woo Daffy back. In real life the movie stars son would be hanging at Chateau Marmont chasing women and putting drinks on his fathers tab. But Fraser a large puppyish man displays enough innocence to pull off the role. Hes also modest enough to let cartoon characters upstage him at times. A Renaissance animation- film actor Fraser also voices the Tasmanian Devil. Bugs is as smooth as ever whether navigating a Hollywood boardroom or roasting carrots over an open fire. The wisecracking rabbit has more appeal than Elfman who doesnt mesh well with the animation and seems slightly irritated much of the time. It must be all that acting opposite a blue screen. The spy story line though something of a boilerplate offers a few flourishes. In Las Vegas the gang encounters a frontier-themed casino owned by Yosemite Sam. The setup is so very plausible in amusement-park Vegas that you wonder why Warner Bros. hasnt built a casino like it in real life. The animation is most assured in a scene where the cartoon characters cavort through paintings in the Louvre. Edvard Munchs famous subject for instance gets something new to scream about. But most of the animation remains comfortingly old school. More retro still is Martins hip-swiveling evildoer only a slight variation on his wild and crazy guy from ""Saturday Night Live."" The thinking was probably this Since most little kids and younger parents dont know Martins shtick from the 1970s why not recycle it? -- Advisory This film contains cartoon violence mild innuendo.

Then again what do you expect from a movie with Looney Tunes in its title something polite like grandmother-approved Brother Bear? Of the two action-packed Looney is the better bet at least for burgeoning playground agitators. Its also better than 1996s Space Jam which also trotted out the Looney stable. More about the movie Looney Tunes Back in Action   1/2 stars out of four Stars Brendan Fraser Jenna Elfman Steve Martin Heather Locklear Timothy Dalton Director Joe Dante Distributor Warner Bros. Rating PG for some mild language and innuendo Opens today nationwide Combining live-action with animation Looney stars Brendan Fraser perhaps too conveniently cast after George of the Jungle and Dudley Do-Right. As a Warner Bros. security guard he ends up on the road to Las Vegas with studio VP Jenna Elfman (well cast) whose job is at risk for canning Daffy. Audience-appeal market research is on her side The Ducks demographics are somewhere down in Mike Tyson territory. But Daffy it turns out is also viewed as sportscaster Howard Cosell used to be The public cant live with him or without him. Sooooooo Elfman has to make good with Daffy while Fraser has to rescue his actor father (Timothy Dalton) as part of a secret-agent plot. Hoping to foil father and son is Steve Martin as the evil head of the Acme corporation. The barely recognizable Martin thinks he can get away with employing 3-year-olds as slave labor by ""putting double espresso in their sippy cups."" The result is no Who Framed Roger Rabbit though Looney does have the same cinematographer Dean Cundey who also shot The Ramones masterpiece Rock n Roll High School a left-field reference that turns out to be germane. Gremlins director Joe Dante (another inspired choice) once helped write Rock n Roll and has stocked his supporting cast with School alums Dick Miller (as a studio cop) Mary Woronov (as an Acme employee) and even the movies producer Roger Corman. To use the lingo of Elfmans character this oddball movie could have skewed appeal. Biggest fans are likely to be children and movie-hip adults who get these references -- which include a walk-on homage (and in character) by the star of perhaps the most revered sci-fi movie of the 50s.

"Looney Tunes scatters the laughs - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Orlando Sentinel Looney Tunes scatters the laughs Jay BoyarSentinel Movie Critic Pity poor Daffy Duck eternal also-ran of Warners world.He tries so very hard sputtering and shouting boasting and plotting and yet his best is always second-best -- at best. As we see in Looney Tunes Back in Action the desperate duck resents playing second fiddle to Bugs Bunny who doesnt even consider Daffy competition.While Daffy is working his tail feathers off to outmaneuver our ""cwazy wabbit"" Bugs plays it cool displaying an almost aristocratic assurance in his top-toon status. Just as Mickey Mouse is untroubled by the outbursts of Disneys duck Donald Bugs knows that at Warner Bros. hes the king of cartoon comedy. As Back in Action begins we find Daffy at a corporate powwow attempting to convince the Warner brothers (who here look like Larry ""Bud"" Melman twins) that hes meant for finer things than being Bugs perpetual stooge. But the brothers and their top execs are having none of it.Kate Houghton (Jenna Elfman) their humorless V.P. of Comedy feels that Daffys fan base is limited to ""angry fat guys in basements."" She insists that the duck be canned. And thanks to her winning track record including such hits as Lethal Weapon Babies he is.Daffy recovers quickly and heads off to Las Vegas where adventure awaits. Meanwhile Bugs who is smart enough to know he needs Daffy as a foil sets out after him.Back in Action then becomes a ""road picture"" -- The Road to Vegas (By Way of Toontown)? -- in the free-and-easy tradition of the ones starring Bing Crosby and Bob Hope. Ski-billed Daffy of course is Hope to Bugs cottontail Der Bingle.As you may have gathered this is the sort of movie like Space Jam and Who Framed Roger Rabbit in which toons and humans mingle. So both Daffy and Bugs are saddled with people as sidekicks. (The tradition also includes You Ought to Be in Pictures the 1940 short in which Daffy persuades Porky Pig to quit cartoons.)Traveling with Daffy is DJ Drake (Brendan Fraser) a security-guard-cum-stuntman whose surname means ""a male duck."" With Bugs is Kate who has had a change of heart about Daffy and whose overbite gives her a rabbity look.DJs father Damian Drake (Timothy Dalton) turns out to be a movie star who is famous for such 007-type adventures as More is Never Enough and Licence to Spy. Damian is also a real spy who has been captured by evildoers.So its up to DJ and Daffy eventually aided by Kate and Bugs to save him.Its implicit that their mission also includes making us laugh. And in a scattershot way they accomplish that.Back in Action which opens today is too long by at least 20 minutes and is hampered by too many cameos both toon and human. Cartoon characters from Pepe Le Pew to Marvin the Martian to Yosemite Sam pop up when you least expect them as do such human stars as Joan Cusack and Heather Locklear.Steve Martin tries a bit too hard in the role of the fiendish foppish chairman of the Acme Corp. which you will recall makes all those faulty contraptions that Wile E. Coyote uses to no avail against the Road Runner. Its the chairman and his henchmen we discover who have kidnapped DJs dad.The plot is overly convoluted Theres something lame in there about the elusive Blue Monkey Diamond and its ability to make people go ape.Still at times the film is achingly funny.You have to laugh for example when you see the stuttering Porky and the Mexican Speedy Gonzales sitting together in the studio commissary and complaining about what political correctness has done to their careers.A takeoff on the shower scene in Psycho is funny as is a passage in which our heroes spot a Wal-Mart in the desert.""Is it a mirage"" someone asks ""or just product placement?""Theres also a visually impressive sequence set in the Louvre in which Daffy and Bugs find themselves transported into - and transformed by -- such classic highly stylized works of art as Dalis ""The Persistence of Memory"" and Munchs ""The Scream.""Back in Action was directed by Joe Dante (Gremlins) who understands the antic spirit of cartoons but has less of a grasp of the rhythms of a feature-length film. In a perfect world he would be making innovative animated shorts.The ramshackle script is by former Simpsons hand Larry Doyle That Wal-Mart gag among others seems culled from the playbook of Homer amp; Co.By the end of the movie you realize that for once Bugs has taken a back seat to Daffy. That in itself makes this film a sort of landmark.In fact at its funniest Looney Tunes Back in Action is so much fun that you dearly wish it all could be that good.You leave the theater smiling but also with a questionThats all folks?Jay Boyar can be reached at jboyarorlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5492.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr C- Looney Tunes Back in Action Genre Comedy Animation; Starring Timothy Dalton Jenna Elfman Brendan Fraser; Director Joe Dante; Author Larry Doyle; Release Date Wide 11/14/2003; Runtime (in minutes) 91; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted November 12 2003 -- 1200 AM EST Remember ""Animaniacs""? The mid-90s TV series that attempted - often successfully - to recapture the subversive self-awareness of classic Warner Bros. cartoons? Well Looney Tunes Back in Action is nothing like that. But it tries very hard to be and its low laugh-to-effort ratio is the upshot. Blending the real world with animation for no compelling conceptual reason other than the bottom line ""Looney"" teams a Warner Bros. studio veep (Jenna Elfman) and a security guard (Brendan Fraser) with Bugs and Daffy in some standard high jinks They must recover an ultrapowerful bauble coveted by the evil head of the Acme Corporation (an unrecognizably bewigged Steve Martin) while vainly attempting to maintain convincing eye contact with nonexistent toons. The results are no relation to ""Roger Rabbit"" but rather a second cousin to ""Space Jam"" - or more accurately those annoying ""Space Jam"" MCI commercials. Nobody sings ""I be-wieve I can cawl"" thankfully but the movie still feels like an infomercial ""The Wacky Warner Bros. Studio-Tour Ride and Quarterly Report"" if you will. Look theres Scooby-Doo Wow Duck Dodgers And hey theyre shooting a Batman movie directed by B-movie king Roger Corman (These days its hard to know if thats a joke or a contingency plan.) Corman it should be noted was the mentor of ""Looney"" director Joe Dante (""Gremlins"") and boy must Papa Schlock be proud The movie makes you feel like youre there...at the annual stockholders meeting. On the off chance that the kiddies wont enjoy a cavalcade of trademarks ""Looney"" crams in noisy noisome action plus chockablock pop homages for parents. There are flashes of wit - Speedy Gonzales muttering about political correctness and an arty chase through the Louvre. But there is also random flatulence a.k.a. the stink of desperation. Amid the Sturm und Cynicism the filmmakers have mistaken Bugs amp; Co.s transgressive candor for unabashed crassness. Thats not exactly dethPICable but it sure is dispiriting.
