By David Denby Mark Wahlberg as a betrayed Marine marksman in Antoine Fuquas movie.   Credit FRANK STOCKTON An incomparable marksman stealthy silent relentless hiding among snowcapped peaks; the muzzle of a high-powered rifle aimed directly at the camera; helicopters swirling over mountains and city streets pursuing the hero from the sky; gunmetal colors everywhere and the chuggah-chuggah-chuggah of pounding drums and electronic music a sound both primal and advanced at the same time ""Shooter"" directed by Antoine Fuqua and starring Mark Wahlberg as Bob Lee Swagger a betrayed Marine marksman who becomes a vigilante crusader for justice is a virtual textbook of action cliches. Fuqua made something fiery and memorable out of ""Training Day"" (2001) with its demonic performance by Denzel Washington as a corrupt cop but here the director serves as little more than a skilled functionary. For two hours chase follows shoot-out as Swagger fires at men who like movie targets from time immemorial obligingly refuse to take cover. Swagger never misses--he could hunt mosquitoes for a living--and the extras both live and digital do their job; they fall down. The action has an oddly undifferentiated wearying feel to it. Yet this standard industrial product does something strange. On the surface the movie offers liberal ideological sentiments it condemns covert overseas operations controlled by oil interests; its angry at the higher-ups who escaped blame for Abu Ghraib; it exhibits a clear distaste for the person and values of Dick Cheney. But it places these sentiments within a matrix of gun culture and lonely-man-of-honor myths. Swagger is the latest incarnation of Rambo the anti-government crazy. The filmmakers may be trying to appeal both to liberals and to the Pat Buchanan conservatives who hate big government and multinational corporations and want American warriors to stay home. The clash of political currents suggests the degree of confusion roiling Hollywood at the moment. How do moviemakers find military heroes in the midst of an unpopular overseas war? When we first see Swagger he is taking down uniformed soldiers as part of a mysterious operation somewhere in the Horn of Africa. The operation is scrubbed and Swagger and his partner a spotter are abandoned. Outraged Swagger quits the Marines and moves to a cabin in Wyoming with his dog. But hes pulled back into action by a retired colonel (Danny Glover) who works in some unnamed federal agency. The colonel tells Swagger that a sniper may be planning to assassinate the President and the agency needs Swagger to think like him and track him down. But the hero is being set up--made to look (for reasons I will not explain) as though hes the one attempting the hit. The plotters try to eliminate their patsy on the spot. Swagger is shot twice falls through a window nearly drowns in the Delaware River yet with all of law enforcement after him manages to escape into the American nowhere. Throughout the rest of the movie he takes vengeance on the swine who tried to do him in--a rogue unit in the government operating under the control of a powerful oil-mad senator from Montana (the Cheney figure played by Ned Beatty). The government may be rotten but American honor is saved by the lone killer. The movie is based on the successful 1993 novel ""Point of Impact"" by the Washington Post film critic Stephen Hunter whose glumly macho fictions (there are three Bob Lee Swagger books) are very different in tone from his shrewd and funny reviews. Swagger has many notches on his gun. From a distance in hiding he has killed dozens of people in war and the movie celebrates his prowess in all its solitary cultic glory while wrapping him in an aura of sanctimonious approval. The mechanics of audience manipulation may be obvious here but they often work. The shooter twice betrayed becomes a victim. His fight against corrupt enemies absolves him of any personal guilt and we can simultaneously enjoy his skill at picking people off and the righteousness of his wrath. The screenwriter Jonathan Lemkin has acknowledged a debt not only to Hunter but to ""Three Days of the Condor"" and ""The Parallax View"" seventies thrillers that drew on fears of shadowy government conspiracies. Lemkin has updated the old plots with gun-catalogue lore. The movie is full of contented talk of rifles and ammunition and at one point Swagger picks up an astounding amount of what can only be called ordnance at a Virginia shopping mall. Snub-nosed and barrel-chested Wahlberg looks a little like a gun himself. ""What I love about Mark"" the movies producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura has said ""is hes not afraid to be a man."" Perhaps not but di Bonaventura and Fuqua seem afraid to let him be an actor. In this role he certainly has the stillness and the determination of a marksman but he mutters in a sludgy monotone thats hard to understand. Wahlberg has an unpretentious air about him and Id hate to see him get locked into dour star turns as an implacable killer. The engaging fast-talking idiosyncrasy of his performance in ""The Departed"" has vanished. In ""300"" a blood-dark account of the battle of Thermopylae the Spartan king Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and his noble queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) make love in the full splendor of their nakedness. When the Spartans pumped like linebackers leaving the weight room go out to fight they wear nothing but leather codpieces and red capes; they die clutching one anothers hands. The Persians go one better. Their king Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) an epicene seven-footer with a shaved head and what looks like a gold-lame thong lounges on cushions in his court surrounded by aroused lesbians intertwined and writhing like snakes in a basket. When he goes out to fight he commands an army of robed and turbaned slaves who enthusiastically hurl themselves onto Spartan spears. ""300"" which grossed nearly a hundred and thirty million dollars in its first ten days of release is perhaps the nuttiest film ever to become an enormous box-office hit. Based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller the movie is a porno-military curiosity--a muscle-magazine fantasy crossed with a video game and an Army recruiting film. The director Zack Snyder poses the Spartan heroes against the horizon or along the crests of mountains under roiling skies. The softening colors of blue and yellow have been filtered or drained out of the palette; the dominant remaining color is the molten brown-gold of bronze shields. The action is prolonged in agonizing slow motion only to snap to hyper-speed and then to a full stop leaving nothing moving but the fountain of blood spurting from a decapitated body. In Tehran after pirated copies hit the streets there a few weeks ago the movie was quickly denounced by an Iranian government spokesman as an act of ""psychological warfare"" that was intended to prepare Americans for an invasion of the country. ""American cultural officials thought they could get mental satisfaction by plundering Irans historic past and insulting this civilization"" he said. The complaint was echoed by President Ahmadinejad who said ""They are trying to tamper with history . . . by making Irans image look savage"" and a Time correspondent reported that many Iranians assumed that the movie was produced by an American government conspiracy. It is perhaps unfair to expect the Iranians to develop a sense of humor about American pop culture. They may also have trouble understanding that commercial American movies are ordered up not by ""cultural officials"" but by studio officials. The film is of course less an act of psychological warfare than an act of capitalism. It was called into being not by a hunger for war but by the desire to exploit a market--professional-wrestling and X-treme Fighting saturnalias play into the movies atmosphere. Everyone screams at everyone and specialized Persian warriors wearing masks and other freakish regalia turn up to do battle. Pop has always drawn energy from the lower floors of respectability; this movie in which fan-boy cultism reaches new levels of goofy chaos and sexual confusion draws energy from the subbasement. Still the Iranians have a point though first planned years ago ""300"" is a political fable that uneasily engages the current moment. An all-volunteer expeditionary force of Spartans ventures forth the warriors sacrificing themselves to stop the invading hordes from killing their wives and children which may be an allusion to the Bush Administrations get-them-in-Iraq-before-they-hit-us-here rationale. The Spartans also fight as a lofty narration informs us ""against mysticism and tyranny."" Against mysticism? How many ancient armies went to their deaths with that as their battle song? And how many men have died as the Spartans do to defend ""reason""? A whiff of contemporary disdain for the East--what the late Edward Said called ""Orientalism""--arises from the mayhem ""300"" turns into a dawn-of-democracy epic in which violence is marshalled to protect the future of Western civilization. Made in a time of frustration when Americans are fighting a war that they can neither win nor abandon ""300"" and ""Shooter"" feel like the products of a culture slowly and painfully going mad.

"The Disrespected Arts Journalist Blues | | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Culture Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Observer Music The Disrespected Arts Journalist Blues By Justin Joffe  07/29/16 324pm Patron saint of schlubby music journalists Lester Bangs. More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked biases who favored feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

In principle its a great tale of derring-do as vastly out-numbered Spartan warriors defend a mountain pass against the mighty Persian army but Zack Snyders movie in no way does justice to it. What should be a thrilling saga of triumph over the odds becomes a yawn-inducing cavalcade of carnage as wave after wave - after wave after wave - of the enemy lines up to be slashed gashed chopped spiked speared and generally mushed. Ho bloody hum. Any ideological connotations to the fact were supposed to be cheering on the white guys as they scythe their way through turban-wearing Persian hordes? Hard to credit the picture with that much relevance though itll doubtless be huge in US Army camps. And speaking of camp... Since its positively tumescent with macho posturing and somewhat bereft of humour the films an absolute riot of ambiguous sexual signage. The buffed-up Spartans for instance go into battle wearing leather posing-pouches and little else as they try to lure their foes into a narrow passage called the Gates of Hell while Rodrigo Santoros Persian leader Xerxes delivers a queeny strop-fest pitched somewhere between RuPaul and Ming the Merciless. It might have been one of the great all-time mad bad movies but for one thing - its just sooo boring.

Picture REVIEW / Strange world of Sparta is not for the meek 1 / 5 Back to Gallery 300 Action drama. Starring Gerard Butler Lena Headey and Dominic West. Directed by Zack Snyder. (R. 117 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. See complete movie listings and show times and buy tickets for select theaters at sfgate.com/movies.) In 480 B.C. 300 Spartans faced thousands of invading Persians in the Battle of Thermopylae. Thats the subject of ""300"" and as with all movies set in the distant past it presents a double and seemingly contradictory challenge to the filmmakers to make history vital and immediate to a modern audience while conveying the strangeness of it all the cultural distance from us and the enormous gulf of time between then and now. Most filmmakers are happy to fulfill only the first challenge -- to make the story relevant or at least accessible. But the makers of ""300"" basing their film on the graphic novel by Frank Miller and Lynn Varley take the second challenge seriously. They take pains to show the strangeness of Sparta at least from our perspective -- its brutality its fanatical obsession with warfare and its code of manhood. The movie thrusts us into this bizarre warlike culture and then just as were beginning to get our balance it surprises us by quickly establishing that these in fact are the good guys. The invading Persians are even worse -- mystical cruel and autocratic with no proto-democratic traditions. The hairstyles and manners of dress arent softened for our benefit but are presented with accuracy with all their jutting beards and braids. If youve ever seen an exhibition of ancient statuary ""300"" is like watching marble turn to flesh and blood and the effect is fascinating. There are probably as many six-pack abs on the men here as youll find on the statues in Romes Capitoline Museums. Its worth noting incidentally that those sculpted bodies make this one of the great beefcake extravaganzas of 2007. Watching ""300"" theres the arresting sense of eavesdropping on another time. Things happen that make little sense to us in terms of our own practices. For example when King Leonidas -- the commanding Gerard Butler - gets annoyed at a Persian messenger he kills him and his entire retinue. I particularly like the little grace note Before he does it he steals a glance at his wife Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) who nods. We think the nod means ""Spare them."" It means quite the opposite. This is our welcome to Sparta. The movie is letting us know that weve never been to a place like this. Yet for all the films fidelity to matters of style and culture director Zack Snyder doesnt offer us a realistic treatment but something more adventurous and intuitive. The colors are exaggerated sometimes underexposed sometimes overexposed sometimes excessively red sometimes excessively blue. The battle scenes call to mind the films graphic-novel origins so that blood never flows like real blood but bursts out in discrete pieces like rose petals. Significantly this hyper-stylization of ""300"" is limited to its visuals. The performances are played straight and this combination -- straight performances and stylized visuals -- produces an uncanny effect. Its as if the movie is reminding us were not seeing history as it truly appeared even if this is history as it happened. Were getting it through the gauze of memory or legend. This layer of distance achieved visually works in many ways. For one thing it allows viewers to witness the butchery of ancient combat -- the severed arms legs and heads -- without having to wallow in buckets of gore. It also allows the filmmakers to show these things without worrying about revolting the audience. But this extra distance works in more subtle emotional ways as well. Because we can never forget were seeing something foreign to our world -- because we dont get lulled in the usual movie way into fusing our reality with that of the characters -- its easier to take the characters and their behavior on their terms. The distance also creates an underlying sadness. This may be a boisterous movie lively and full of action but the director never lets us forget that were seeing something gone and almost lost to time. Youll notice were at the end of the review and with little said about the story or the actors. Actually you know everything you need to know about the story - 300 soldiers versus tens of thousands - and in a movie such as this the acting takes a backseat both to narrative drive and to the vistas of stone and hard flesh like something out of a Frank Frazetta painting. However Butler must be singled out for praise. He played Beowulf recently (""Beowulf amp; Grendel"") and didnt fare nearly as well having to share a girlfriend with an 8-foot monster. Here working with material worthy of him he enters into the ancient psychology of the role and comes back every inch a king. -- Advisory Severed limbs stylized blood lots of violence nudity simulated Spartan sex.

BY Jack Mathewsdaily News Columnist Saturday March 10 2007 1240 AM 300 View the photo gallery Stylized adaptation of Frank Millers violent graphic novel about the 480 B.C. Battle of Thermopylae. With Gerard Butler Lena Headey. Director Zack Snyder (157). R Graphic battle sequences sexuality and nudity. Area theaters. Over lunch with an old college friend the other day I was saying that a critics job is to rationalize his or her response to a film. You can be moved by a story a performance or by the power of the images themselves. But you do have to be moved. Then while digesting our Stage Deli sandwiches we watched Zack Snyders adaptation of Frank Millers graphic novel ""300"" and I had a case in point. This fantasized dramatization of the 480 B.C. Battle of Thermopylae where 300 hard-bodied highly disciplined Spartan soldiers made a valiant stand against a million Persians didnt move me with its story or by any of its performances. But its impossible not to be moved by its nearly nonstop visual assault. ""300"" with its gold hues and computergenerated images is not nearly as interesting to look at as Robert Rodriguez and Frank Millers 2005 adaptation of Millers ""Sin City."" But when it comes to bloody action there is a lot more of it. However many Persians met their deaths from a Spartan blade during that three-day battle it feels as if we see every slice and dice. The problem for me is that a little combat violence goes a long way and a little stylized violence goes even further. After a while the hand-to-hand fighting - with lopped-off heads rolling and blood splattering - morphs into a noisy cartoon. ""300"" makes no claims of historical accuracy. Miller took the legend of Thermopylae and turned it into a myth along the lines of the Trojan War. There are no gods intruding here but there are mystics and monsters and scar-faced hordes that would seem at home in Tolkiens Middle-earth. And the rivals - Spartan King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and Persian King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) - are larger than life. The R rating promises some sex and nudity and thats where Lena Headey comes in as Spartas beautiful Queen Gorgo (I hope Leonidas had a pet name for her). She and the king do some strenuous canoodling before hes off to fight the Persians and when hes gone she has to deal with Theron (Dominic West) Leonidas powerful rival in the Greek assembly. When the queen tries to enlist Therons help in sending the full Spartan army to help Leonidas he demands sexual favors and then rats her out to the assembly as a whore. The event that follows may be the source of the phrase ""Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned."" There has been some Inter-net chatter that actually leached onto the pages of The New York Times about parallels between Thermopylae and the Iraq war - whether George Bush is more like Xerxes who wanted to rule the world or Leonidas an ideal-ist fighting for freedom. The filmmakers deny any intentional parallels and I couldnt find one. Dick Cheney may be a bit like Xerxes and Bush a bit like Leonidas. But the Greek and Persian kings liked to fight; Bush and Cheney just like to watch. jmathewsnydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Its a total-immersion battle experience for eaters of red meat worshippers of the male physique and lovers of extreme violence.Leonidas (Gerard Butler foreground) and his men stand before the days dead on the battlefield in <i>300</i>.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. March 9 2007  (out of 4)Starring Gerard Butler Lena Headey Dominic West and Rodrigo Santoro. Directed by Zack Snyder. 117 minutes. At major theatres. 18A  Article Continued Below All you sissies and pantywaists out of the theatre. This means you Skippy cowering in the corner with your man purse and your granola bar.The Spartan warrior movie 300 is not for the meek despite its visual virtues and high thrill quotient. Its a total-immersion battle experience for eaters of red meat worshippers of the male physique and lovers of extreme violence.That last qualifier is crucial. If you wince at the sight of skewered bodies and decapitated skulls then your money is better spent on a repeat screening of An Inconvenient Truth.This is the kind of film where the dead bodies really are stacked like cordwood and then pushed in a heap on top of people who are about to become dead bodies. ""Pile those Persians higher"" someone commands.The manly dudes in 300 run around nearly naked their swords constantly at the ready. They tell one another to have a good breakfast ""because tonight we dine in hell."" How those meals are connected Ill never know. But if youre wondering what hells cafeteria has on the menu wonder no more. Its human kebabs.In bringing Frank Millers graphic novel about the ancient Battle of Thermopylae to the screen Zack Snyder (Dawn of the Dead remake) has demonstrated the kind of fidelity that could earn him an eternity ring were such girly-man behaviour tolerated. Millers violence has been graphically rendered.The special effects are impressive combining artistic vision with the blood-and-guts reality of warfare. Its more colourful than Sin City Millers other cinematic adaptation because the desaturated reds of the painterly production design match the flowing blood.The visuals are strong enough to sustain the anemic plot - this is Spartan in more ways than one - and dialogue that verges on the risible.And its a weirdly schizophrenic affair. The acres of rippling beefcake on display make this arguably the most homoerotic film ever released to the mainstream. If theres not a 300 float in this years Pride parade then someone deserves a Spartan spanking. Yet the film manages to also be homophobic. Spartan King Leonidas (Gerard Butler newly buff and convincingly bombastic) expresses his contempt for non-combative Athenians by dismissing them as ""philosophers and boy lovers.""Whats really unsettling is the gratuitous gore. Such as a post-battle scene where Leonidas munches on an apple while standing in a field of dead Persians while his men go about crushing the skulls of fallen invaders who might still be breathing.The movie is based on historical fact something that could surprise anyone who understandably views 300 as simply a fanboys wet dream complete with dream sequences of semi-nude goddesses. The Battle of Thermopylae is one of the most famous showdowns of antiquity. A small but brave army of Spartans - the 300 of the title - and other Greeks banded together against the multitudes of Persias invaders. In more recent times wed think of the siege of the Alamo Custers Last Stand or the Japanese defence of Iwo Jima.Its the year 480 B.C. and Leonidas is offered a Hobsons choice by the advancing armies of Persian Emperor Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) surrender Sparta and become slaves or stand fast and be slaughtered.Leonidas chooses a third option fight back and hold the barbarians long enough so that Greece can properly marshal its forces. The king has no trouble rounding up 299 brave fellow Spartans to join him but he gets no support from the scabby soothsayers and sexy oracles who live in the nearby hilltops like Dr. Seuss characters. Leonidas is told to hold his fire until after the celebration of an annual harvest festival.He also faces resistance from a swinish politician Theron (Dominic West) who views Leonidas as a competitor - not just for Spartan power but also for the affections of Gorgo (Lena Headey) Leonidass loyal wife and queen.The Spartan king has reason beyond the ""live free or die"" ethos to disobey the oracles and to confront the Emperor Xerxes. The Persian leader looks like an escapee from a carnival with more piercings than Moby Dick. Xerxes commands a menagerie of homicidal freaks that include rampaging rhinos and elephants and a dim giant. Hes more clown than dictator.Leonidas does have one ace up his sleeve if he and his men can draw the Persians towards the narrow seaside mountain passage known as ""the gates of hell"" they might be able to literally put the squeeze on them.""There is no room for softness not in Sparta"" Leonidas says. Hes not kidding. Dont worry about missing a single severed head or impaled torso. Director Snyder frequently switches to slow-mo to savour every appalling act. And hes not above incorporating a Crucifixion image at the end to drive home his point about the nobility of going to war to defend your nation a subtext that will make this popular entertainment for Conservatives and Republicans everywhere.Its most definitely a Spartan movie yet its really all about wretched excess.

Photo Warner Bros. 300 Stylish violent and true to history comic books 1 / 2 Back to Gallery ""Prepare for glory"" yowls the granitic and pointy-bearded Spartan king to his virile troops in 300 a handsome monstrosity of a film. This directive has been repeated on every shred of the movies advertising priming audiences for a battle between muscle-head combatants on a beach in ancient Greece. Glory? Sure theres glory along with a pop-eyed ogre and a smashingly accessorized Persian god-boy with a brow as plucked as Barbies. But brace yourselves for something else too. Prepare for a film that decapitates with conviction splatters with glee poses like a fitness mag emotes like an opera intones like a sportscaster and plays out like Homer in the age of comic books. It is to conventional cinema what graphic novels are to prose mannered trenchant and chesty. (Not since Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan havean actors pectorals been so alarming.) Its also the strangest and most deliriously violent movie I have ever confessed to liking. 300 is based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller (who wrote and illustrated) and Lynn Varley (who created its distinctive slashy colors) and directed by Zack Snyder whose waggish re-do of Dawn of the Dead shed similar quantities of blood in a similarly losing battle. In that film a brave few mall denizens staved off teeming hordes of the hungry undead. In this one the brave few are 300 Spartan warriors 480 B.C. and the teeming hordes are Persian armies on a quest for world domination. The setting has moved from suburban tarmac to the Battle of Thermopylae where the Greeks fight off invaders at a narrow pass. Leading the Spartans and their much-wussier Arcadian allies is King Leonidas he of the pointy beard and Ricardo Montalban bustiness. I cannot say enough nice things about Leonidas or the actor who plays him Gerard Butler whos never been a wispy presence in film (Beowulf and Grendel Phantom of the Opera) but here comes across as a large hunk of metamorphic rock. Hes elemental. So much of the film is so thoroughly green-screened -- so beautifully computerized -- that I began to wonder whether Butler himself was assembled by techies with only Millers book and a few Greek myths to guide them. The whole undertaking has this look about it -- this geek-chic celebration of demigod six-packs and mondo-stylized overstatement. Scenes are staged from comic-book angles with comic-book lighting casting comic-book shadows that darken vistas of dreamlike trickery. Realism is nowhere to be found replaced by go-go gory reenactments in which gobs of blood fly in perfect arcs and combat rings with the splish krak shkreek of death by metal pike. Every few minutes comes a scene of fantastic artifice the arrival of the Persian disco-king Xerxes (Brazilian star Rodrigo Santoro) on a temple carried by slaves or a gray cloud of arrows that curve toward Spartans huddled under shields. Snyders movie is as breathy epic and expressionistic as many classic silent films hacking huge emotions from fire-eating dialogue (""Hold Give up nothing But take from them everything"") that might have ripped from title cards. Its airless but so are graphic novels; its hyperbolic but so is the mythos of war. Is 300 faithful to history?

Pictures A wounded Leonidas (Gerard Butler) roars his defiance at the Persian invaders in ""300.""Show Caption of Expand By  Lisa Kennedy PUBLISHED March 7 2007 at 351 pm | UPDATED May 7 2016 at 948 pm Sign up for newsletters and alerts Submit your news tips or photos Most Popular Former Japanese consulate residence hits the Denver market for 4.2 million Sports Authority plans to pay top executives 2.85 million in bankruptcy bonuses Donald Trump stumps in Colorado promises ""No more Mr. Nice Guy"" Blake Shelton plays free intimate show at Denvers Grizzly Rose Tennis-ball-sized hail knocks out 27 Colorado Springs police cars Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Dear ""subjects and citizens"" of a warring nation And by that we mean the U.S. not Sparta during the period depicted in ""300."" In the years since the mission was declared accomplished many of you have avoided films about warfare. Even as a number of these movies resonate with our current predicament e.g. ""Jarhead."" Or like Clint Eastwoods ""Flags of Our Fathers"" and ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" they raise potent questions about war nationalism and heroism. Commanding documentaries ""War Tapes"" and ""The Ground Truth"" connected us to the very citizens we honor in words soldiers. (The Walter Reed debacle suggests more talking the talk.) Yet many of us didnt see those either. So why do we have a defeated feeling that despite this consumer indifference there are legions of fanboys waiting to help Zack Snyders flashy and silly adaptation of Frank Millers graphic novel about Spartan King Leonidas and his legendary battle with Persian ruler Xer- xes lay siege to the box office? ""How silly?"" you ask. When a burly black ally of Spartan politician Theron (Dominic West looking very Romulan) celebrates the councilmans power grab you half expect him to burst into one of Geoffrey Holders famous ""uncola nut"" laughs. The tale begins with a narration intent on telegraphing the glory secured at the Battle of Thermopylae. It is about how ""The Boy"" became a warrior. Or as Gorgo (Lena Headey) the Queen of Sparta and wife of Leonidas tells Xerxes unfortunate emissary ""Only Spartan women give birth to real men."" Gerard Butler played the title character in ""The Phantom of the Opera."" In spite of his physical insistence his kings charisma is elusive. He vigorously enunciates like a summer stock player doing Shakespeare. But the writings overblown. And locating the requisite sorrow in this tale of heroism is an afterthought for Snyder and Co. There are however plenty of examples of if not comedy masculine camp. A nubile oracle asked by the ephors does a dance of the veils as reimagined by the house choreographer for a strip joint. After a shimmy she moans into one of the ephors ears a warning for the king not to wage war during the festival of Carneia. The 300 men Leonidas enlists constitute his loophole. The ephors are the grotesques who provide the last word on Spartas rule of law. And one of the amusing things about ""300"" is how good-looking Leonidas crew is. There is nary a fella among them who couldnt own the cover of Mens Health. The Persians on the other hand suggest this battle took place in 480 B.D. before dentistry. After a girly show provided by Xerxes a deformed hunchback betrays his handsome Spartan countrymen. Wars not ugly. Ugly is ugly. Ads for ""300"" started appearing around the run-up to the Super Bowl. They were easy to mistake for those Marine Corps commercials that start with an image of ancient bravery then morph into a pitch for the few and the proud. And there is an undeniable ""Oohrah"" tone to ""300."" Telling a countryman vexed by the scant number of warriors Leonidas brings he replies that his 300 are already more battle-ready than any other Greek citys hodgepodge battalion of craftsmen and artisans. To underscore their kings claim the 300 grunt in one deep-throated exclamation during basic training. ""300"" makes one yearn for the daft humor of Jason and his Argonauts the zany effects of Ray Harryhausen. Because like ""Sin City"" (Robert Rodriguezs superior collaboration with Miller) ""300"" appears deeper than it is. In falling betwixt and between severity and aesthetic flash ""300"" aggravates or tickles depending on your mood. The preview audience chuckled at the toss-off quips common in action flicks. My own humors were vexed by the glorifying of a bygone war without any of the ancients wisdom about its cost.

She has just come from tropical Calcutta to the ice and snow of New York City with a new husband she barely knows an ambitious young man who has lived in New York and works in fiber optics. She knows nothing about anything in this city. Warily she examines a box of Rice Krispies pours a helping into a bowl sprinkles it with curry powder and munches a first spoonful of the dry mixture without pleasure. This immensely pleasurable film is anything but dry. Its a saga of the immigrant experience that captures the snap crackle and pop of American life along with the pounding pulse emotional reticence volcanic colors and cherished rituals of Indian culture. ENLARGE ""The Namesake"" was directed by Mira Nair from a screenplay that Sooni Taraporevala adapted from the debut novel of the same name by Jhumpa Lahiri. In her previous film ""Monsoon Wedding"" Ms. Nair evoked the drama of an extended family by bringing its far-flung members together for a ceremony in New Delhi. This time her story is centrifugal at least at the start. After an arranged marriage a pair of almost perfect strangers Ashoke Ganguli and his bride Ashima fly off to the United States where they struggle to put down roots succeed beyond their hopes and raise an almost thoroughly American son -- the namesake of the title -- with the singular moniker of Gogol Ganguli. My experience with this family was a reminder of how affecting Mira Nairs work can be. The first time I saw her lovely new film was almost six months ago at the Telluride Film Festival. Since I hadnt taken notes at that viewing I saw it a second time a few weeks ago. Once again in the company of characters Id cared deeply about I caught myself feeling irrationally but persistently that I could predict the Gangulis future with all the anxiety and satisfaction that such a gift implies. Ashima the initially lonely bride is played by the Indian film star Tabu whose skill and tact are equal to her startling beauty or vice versa. Ashimas future looks bleak at the time of her Rice Krispies repast. She has no way of knowing if the bookish bespectacled man she has married will be cool to her cruel to her or simply detached from her as he carves out a career in his adopted land. But that question is answered in a flash in the sort of outwardly simple effortlessly complex scene that Ms. Nair does so well. Ashoke is in fact a man of extraordinary kindness and tenderness. He is played by the Hindi actor Irrfan Khan with a brilliance thats all the more astonishing for being self-contained. Your heart could melt when at a much later point Ashoke tells his son of the happiness that the boys birth brought into his life ""Every day since then has been a gift Gogol."" And thats only one of several meltworthy scenes in the movie. In the hands of a lesser filmmaker this material might have been the stuff of soap opera. Here it feels improbably pristine. The story of how a very Bengali couples son came to be the namesake of a quintessentially Russian writer is the narrative that informs the familys life in America and Calcutta alike. (The film which was scored by Nitin Sawhney and photographed dazzlingly by Frederick Elmes plays out in both places.) The role of Gogol is therefore crucial and Kal Penn (of ""Harold and Kumar"" fame) fills it with a charming goofiness -- the teenage Gogol is a soul mate of Winona Ryders droll depressive in ""Beetlejuice"" -- that eventually yields to endearing manhood. Gogols adventures as the semi-self-invented Nick give ""The Namesake"" its generational sweep (Jacinda Barrett and Zuleikha Robinson play two of his girlfriends) and his rejection of his heritage constitutes half of the classic template of immigrant sagas. The other half -- reclaiming his heritage when hes wise enough to do so -- brings him to appreciate the parents hes been blessed with. On that score weve been way ahead of him. 300 ENLARGE Gerard Butler plays a warrior wounded on the battlefield in ""300"" an adaptation of Frank Millers graphic novel. ""300"" presents a dual clash of civilizations. An action adventure that pits thousands of Persians against 300 brave Spartans at the Battle of Thermopylae it also pits millions of fans of brainless violence against a gallant band or so I choose to think of us who still expect movies to contain detectable traces of humanity. The oracles have already foretold which side will win this weekends Battle of the Box Office. Like ""Sin City"" before it ""300"" was adapted from a graphic novel by Frank Miller and uses digital techniques as well as a palette of doomy-dreary tones to fill the screen with striking images -- massed armies huddled phalanxes piled corpses loathsome monsters a tree of death. (The director was Zack Snyder and the production designer was James Bissell.) The giant-screen IMAX version to which I unwittingly subjected myself ups the ante from striking to assaulting -- so many depictions of impalements eviscerations amputations and graphic beheadings that you dont know what to worry about the most the body count or the head count. Being a Spartan the movie tells us was about pride pecs and abs. Being a Persian was about leering body piercing and particularly in the case of the bass-boosted Xerxes bejeweled preening; his costume would be a stunner on any runway in the modern world. Maxed Out ""Maxed Out"" tells us what we already know -- were a nation of credit-card abusers -- in a way that lets us focus on the follies and misfortunes of others. James Scurlocks documentary serves up cautionary tales of epic abuse though the overall tone is faux cheerful and sometimes genuinely entertaining especially in the use of clips from an old educational film that looks too fatuous to be faux. The film within the film features an insufferably pompous authority figure named Mr. Money. ""To earn credit"" Mr. Money tells an earnest young couple ""first you have to develop your character; you have to be trustworthy."" The trustworthiness of the film outside the film is variable. Its authority figures range from the articulate and persuasive Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren who repeats charges she has made elsewhere that that the government and the credit-card industry are in cahoots through unsubstantiated assertions of national credit bureaus with error rates of 90 percent to the unquenchable indeed unavoidable Robin Leach who informs us that ""the rich are getting richer and that aint gonna stop.""    DVD TIP Immigration of the illegal kind provides the context for ""Up and Down"" (2005) a giddily intricate Czech comedy with English subtitles that was directed by Jan Hrejbek from a screenplay by Petr Jarchovsky. The story begins when two Czech coyotes -- of the alien-smuggling kind -- leave a load of Indian illegals at night by the side of a deserted road then discover a baby in the back of their truck.

"The battle epic 300 reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up The battle epic 300 reviewed. The battle epic 300 reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.March 8 2007 715 PM A Movie Only a Spartan Could Love The battle epic 300. By Dana Stevens 300 If 300 the new battle epic based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller and Lynn Varley had been made in Germany in the mid-1930s it would be studied today alongside The Eternal Jew as a textbook example of how race-baiting fantasy and nationalist myth can serve as an incitement to total war. Since its a product of the post-ideological post-Xbox 21st century 300 will instead be talked about as a technical achievement the next blip on the increasingly blurry line between movies and video games. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Directed by Zack Snyder whose first feature film was the 2004 makeover of the horror classic Dawn of the Dead 300 digitally re-creates the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C. where according to classical history and legend the Spartan king Leonidas led a force of only 300 men against a Persian enemy numbering in the hundreds of thousands. The comic fanboys who make up 300s primary audience demographic arent likely to get hung up on the movies historical content much less any parallels with present-day politics. But whats maddening about 300 (besides the paralyzing monotony of watching chiseled white guys make shish kebabs from swarthy Persians for 116 indistinguishable minutes) is that no one involved--not Miller not Snyder not one of the army of screenwriters art directors and tech wizards who mounted this empty gorgeous spectacle--seems to have noticed that were in the middle of an actual war. With actual Persians (or at least denizens of that vast swath of land once occupied by the Persian empire). Advertisement In interviews Snyder insists that he ""really just wanted to make a movie that is a ride""--a perfectly fine ambition for any filmmaker especially one inspired by the comics. And visually 300 is thrilling color-processed to a burnished monochromatic copper and packed with painterly if static tableauxvivants. But to cast 300 as a purely apolitical romp of an action film smacks of either disingenuousness or complete obliviousness. One of the few war movies Ive seen in the past two decades that doesnt include at least some nod in the direction of antiwar sentiment 300 is a mythic ode to righteous bellicosity. In at least one way the film is true to the ethos of ancient Greece It conflates moral excellence and physical beauty (which in this movie means being young white male and fresh from the gyms of Brentwood). Here are just a few of the categories that are not-so-vaguely conflated with the ""bad"" (i.e. Persian) side in the movie black people. Brown people. Disfigured people. Gay men (not gay in the buff homoerotic Spartan fashion but in the effeminate Persian style). Lesbians. Disfigured lesbians. Ten-foot-tall giants with filed teeth and lobster claws. Elephants and rhinos (filthy creatures both). The Persian commander the god-king Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) is a towering bald club fag with facial piercings kohl-rimmed eyes and a disturbing predilection for making people kneel before him. Meanwhile the Spartans clad in naught but leather man-briefs fight under the stern command of Leonidas (Gerard Butler) whose warrior ethic was forged during a childhood spent fighting wolves in the snow. Leonidas likes to rally the troops with bellowed speeches about ""freedom"" ""honor"" and ""glory"" promising that they will be remembered for having created ""a world free from mysticism and tyranny."" (The mens usual response a fist-pumping ""A-whoo A-whoo"" sounds strangely fratty.) But Leonidas is not above playing the tyrant himself. When a messenger from Xerxes arrives bearing news Leonidas doesnt like he hurls the man against all protocol down a convenient bottomless well in the center of town. ""This is blasphemy This is madness"" says the messenger pleading for his life. ""This is Sparta"" Leonidas replies. So if Spartan law is defined by ""whatever Leonidas wants"" what are the 300 fighting for anyway? And why does that sound depressingly familiar? Another of the Spartans less-than-glorious customs is the practice of eugenics hurling any less-than-perfect infant off a cliff onto a huge pile of baby skeletons. Unfortunately for the 300 at Thermopylae this system of racial cleansing isnt foolproof One deformed hunchback Ephialtes (Andrew Tiernan) manages to make it to adulthood and begs Leonidas for a chance to serve Sparta in the 300. Sure enough when hes turned down the hunchback confirms his moral weakness by accepting Xerxes offer to join ranks with the Persians. Meanwhile back home in Sparta Leonidas wife Gorgo (Lena Headey) engages in some plot-padding political intrigue with the evil Theron (The Wires Dominic West looking particularly risible in classical drapery). Theron wants to persuade the Spartan council not to send reinforcements to the desperately outnumbered 300 (what is he a Democrat?). The noble and sexy Gorgo finally gives herself to Theron in exchange for a chance to persuade the council. ""This will not be over quickly"" the villain warns as he pins her against a temple pillar. ""You will not enjoy this."" It might have been Zack Snyder himself whispering in my ear and he would have been right. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

"At the gates of gore - Mercury News Entertainment Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeAt the gates of goreGRUESOME TALE OF SPARTAN-PERSIAN BATTLE MATCHES DARK GRAPHIC NOVEL ON WHICH ITS BASEDBy Bruce NewmanMercury NewsPosted 03/08/2007 033627 PM PSTUpdated 03/08/2007 035631 PM PST Leonidas played by Gerard Butler right and the Spartans stand ready to halt the advance of the Persian army in ""300."" (Warner Bros. Pictures) If looks could kill the Spartan warriors who spend most of ""300"" flexing their six-pack abs at the invading Persian army would have surely won the Battle of Thermopylae. In defense of Greece the 300 Spartans chose to go into battle wearing little more than leathery G-strings apparently believing that only in combat could they show the world what they were really made of. That seems to be the historical underpinning - the underpants if you will - upon which rests the heroic tale of Leonidas. (The heroic tail of Gerard Butler having gone from the more elaborate rigging of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" down to a Speedo and a spear fills the kings royal kit.) Leonidas devised the idea of going to war with fewer troops than seems like a good idea long before it occurred to anyone at the Pentagon. ""300"" is slaughter on a grand and gaudy scale in which the Spartans gallant stand at the Hot Gates of Thermopylae is turned into a slow-motion slice and dice. As summer entertainment anything with this much blood would ordinarily be difficult to resist. But coming on the eve of Daylight Savings Time ""300"" has the cold dark feel of a false spring. Unless you like human shish kabob dont spring forward. Fall back. Leonidas led his thonged throng against an invading force that numbered more than a million men plus three elephants and what appears to be the entire stable of freaks from the 480 B.Advertisement C. version of the World Wrestling Federation. The Spartans code in battle was Never retreat. Never surrender. Prepare for glory In this adaptation of the graphic novel by Frank Miller and Lynn Varley however prepare for gory. Before anything can happen in this movie - and nothing much does for at least half an hour - Leonidas has to get permission to go to war from a group of slobbering inbred leprous priests. Sort of like Congress but with boils. They receive their prophecy from a writhing naked yet totally oracular teenage girl. And there is licking involved. This nymphet denies him permission to fight the Persian army but she does get him stirred up enough in other ways that he immediately goes back to the palace and gives the queen a little something to remember him by. Gorgo (Lena Headey) is a typical Spartan wife always ready for the next battle whether its in the bedroom or at the Hot Gates of hell. When Leonidas formulates a strategy to meet Xerxes in battle despite the oracles prophecy - surrounding himself with a phalanx of what he describes to the elders as 300 ""bodyguards"" - Gorgo tells him ""Come back with your shield. Or on it."" Leonidas chooses the Hot Gates - a narrow pass on the cliffs of the Adriatic Sea - to turn Greek geography to his advantage. The army of slaves that Xerxes commanded was the superpower of its day a swarming hive of destruction driven forward with whips. We dont see Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) until after the first skirmish when he is borne onto the battlefield aboard a great parade float looking like one of the Village People B.C. (Before Crystal-meth). He speaks in a voice more suggestive of hormone replacement therapy than megalomania (although the two are not mutually exclusive) then scuttles off to a faraway cliff to watch the fighting like some distant disco god. When the battle is finally in full swing it seems to occur at normal speed until spears start going through bodies and blades sever heads from necks. Then the action switches to slow motion so that the splash of blood and the toppling head can be seen as gruesome spectacle. Almost no one in ""300"" talks; they bellow and snarl uttering lines like ""Pile those Persians high"" and of course ""Spartans tonight we dine in hell"" as if they were hurling thunderbolts. The costumes are spectacular particularly those worn by a masked cadre of Persian warriors. But ""300"" has been shot by director Zack Snyder to look like a graphic novel and its dark gritty appearance suits the material better than it suits the eye. Spartan warriors considered the sacrifice of their lives in battle a ""beautiful death."" And in ""300"" thats exactly what they get. Contact Bruce Newman at bnewmanmercurynews.com or (408) 920-5004.

But director Zack Snyders adaptation of Frank Millers graphic novel about the Battle of Thermopylae is anything but downbeat. The three hundred strong are after all Spartans and their stand against 250000 Persian invaders under Xerxes is legendary.And dont the filmmakers know it. Just about everything in this pea-brained epic is overscaled and overwrought - its a cartoon trying to be a towering triptych. The dissonance between the films heroic ambitions and its grindingly coarse treatment is rather amusing. It pays to remember that the films target audience is teenage boys.Sparta is rendered without irony as the ideal Greek city-state. Boys are taken from their mothers at age 7 to learn the art of war. The Spartan king Leonidas (Gerard Butler) does not think much of the rival Athenians whom he dismisses as ""philosophers and boy lovers."" Far better to hone ones pecs than ones intellect. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? When a Persian emissary demands that Leonidas submit to Xerxes the Spartan honcho literally kills the messenger. Despite a lot of oracular mumbo jumbo warning Leonidas to cool it he assembles three hundred - I guess its actually 299 - stalwart hunks to go up against Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) knowing full well they all will die. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 But for Leonidas nothing less than the future of democracy is at stake (although his penchant for impaling every last Persian battle survivor isnt exactly the most high-minded of gestures). By setting a stoic example and allowing other Hellenic forces to take up the charge he guarantees his place in the history books. And the comic books.By the way dont be misled by all the Internet-fueled chatter about how Leonidas or Xerxes is a stand-in for George W. Bush. Never was a movie less of a candidate for an Op-Ed piece.As in ""Sin City"" last years foray into Frank Miller terrain ""300"" mixes live actors with virtual backgrounds and computer-generated effects and gussies everything up in harsh colorations. But whereas the palette for ""Sin City"" was mostly brackish the visuals here are replete with flaming oranges and burnt umbers. The battles are gaudy with blood. Once the fighting begins about 45 minutes into the movie so many heads are severed that I would imagine even Hannibal Lecter had he been a Spartan would have gone AWOL.The Spartans to a man are fighting machines who look as if theyve been spending quality time on their rowing machines. They look like cover models for ""Muscle and Fitness"" magazine. When they rampage over the Persians we might as well be watching a WWE Smackdown Thermopylae-style ""Leonidas vs. Xerxes"" Pity there was no pay-per view in 480 B.C.One longs for a bit of the hyper-feminine to offset all the bellowing and teeth-baring. But Gorgo the Spartan queen played by Lena Headey is as much a political animal as her husband. Slinky and patrician shes a mans-man woman - she understands that only Spartan mothers can deliver Spartan babies.The filmmakers load the dice somewhat by making Leonidass kingly adversary such a twit. Xerxes may think hes a man-god but with his nose and ear ringlets shaved head and jewels he resembles a transgendered cross between Tina Turner and Sabu. Forget war fever. This guys got disco fever.I would love to see ""300"" paired on a double bill with ""Apocalypto"" another head-rolling contest with mythic pretentions and skimpy brain wattage. Better yet why not pair it with ""The Seven Samurai""? That matchup would definitely be to the advantage of Team Kurosawa. The great Japanese director understood that genuine heroes are not heroic 24/7. They are even capable of experiencing you know fear. In the world of ""300"" fear is the exclusive province of girly men. Grade C Rated R for graphic battle sequences sexuality and nudity.

"Sweating it out at the Hot Gates - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Events    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Sweating it out at the Hot Gates In 300 swords sandals and buff bodies pile up By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  March 9 2007 The title of ""300"" the new piece of Hollywood action porn refers to the number of Spartan warriors who futilely but audaciously took on the Persians oh-so many centuries ago. But that number could also represent the number of stars many of the exhilarated boys would give this movie upon exiting -- ""boy"" being a state of mind of course. Im inclined to give 298 fewer. Then sadly Im no longer the sort of lad who goes for souped-up remixes of say ""Gladiator.""For fans of the Frank Miller-Lynn Varley graphic novel from which ""300"" has been adapted the movie parks itself in the big manly wheelhouse of lots of filmgoers. But theres a stale synthetic airlessness about the movie. Imagine a large cast trapped in a series of spectacular screensavers. It could be ancient Greece. It could be somebodys hard drive.Either way the film never feels like more than an exercise for the filmmakers and the actors. They appear to have spent the entire production at whatever gym Hercules went to. Indeed if you happen to enjoy spending almost two hours watching a bunch of worked-out UK thespians battle for the survival of Hellenism in only sandals leather codpieces and vermilion capes run dont walk.Written by Kurt Johnstad Michael B. Gordon and the director Zach Snyder whose other movie is 2004s ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake ""300"" brings us the mythic Battle of Thermopylae -- also known as the Hot Gates -- as narrated in a spirited storybook manner by the Spartan battler Dilios (David Wenham an Australian).There in 480 BC the Spartans try to hold off what they think is a million or so Persian invaders from entering central Greece. Spartas King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) defies the will of the Greek people and the governing council leading his men to their legendary doom. While Leonidas and his men are off bludgeoning for valor his wife Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) remains behind both to ward off the leering insinuations of Theron (Dominic West) a scheming politico and to urge the government to commit more troops to back her husband.The brawling sequences have a kind of visual awesomeness. Scenes of the men slashing and impaling each other while muscle rock plays on the soundtrack are usually chaotically edited but occasionally the frame slows so that the maneuvering and stabbing and leaping and linebacking operate at a dreamy clip. Its as if everybody is slaughtering everybody else underwater. (Theres a sex scene that seems shot at the same speed but the brawls are less ludicrous.)Blending digital fakery with real athleticism these are show-stopping sequences that deserve an ovation for the technicians stunt coordinators and production-design team whove brought them off. When the men arent fighting though the movie is almost dead. Boredom builds up between the artificial opera of the battles like plaque. The movie needs more of the campy bluster the Scottish Butler injects into a few scenes. Once he chomps on an apple atop of a pile of massacred Persians. Hes like Sean Connery doing Robert Duvall in ""Apocalypse Now"" in a chicer version of the costume Connery wore in ""Zardoz."" Butler gives us a flash of hunky clunky Richard Egan in 1962s "" The 300 Spartans"" too. Otherwise the movie is busy trumpeting such abstract principles as Glory Duty and Destiny in speeches roared by the cast as though Herodotus himself had written them.Its a testament to the inherent cinematic depth of Millers graphic novels that the movies based on them are so vicariously dull. ""Sin City"" was like watching your buddy get a lap dance. ""300"" is often like watching that buddy play a video game. Theres no room to breath but plenty of time to wait. And nothing seems approachably real. Even the blood is digital.Much has been made of the allegorical potential of ""300."" Could Leonidas be some President Bush stand-in? Might the Persians be well the current Middle East? The movie could be all things to all people. For me the fight is unfair. ""300"" is about a bunch of hot white metrosexuals -- those pecs those abs that hair -- against a million freaky nonwhite club kids. In other words the gays. King Xerxess hangout is full hookah-puffers derelicts and girls making it with girls (lets call them lesbians). His army is full of monsters seemingly from the Troma Films creature shop.The dreaded Xerxes himself (Rodrigo Santoro) appears to be a 9-foot-tall Yul Brynner . His skin glitters. His head is totally shaved. His nails are manicured. His body is pierced and gold chains run from his scalp to his ankles. Its Yul the mystical Miami nightclub version During their big mano-a-mano attempt at negotiation Xerxes tells Leonidas nothing would bring him more pleasure than for the Greek king to kneel down before him in submission. Leonidas recoils. So did the dudes next to me in the theater when Xerxes started to make his move.According to this outrageously flagrant movie the Spartans didnt just die for Glory Duty and Destiny. They died to keep the Hot Gates from turning into another gay disco.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/movies/blog.

Comments 300 Rated R  117 minutes Frank Millers graphic novel about the Battle of Thermopylae where 300 Spartans battled the entire Persian army in 480 BC has been adapted into a CG sword-and-sandal epic. The disconnect between the human actors and the digital backgrounds is more pronounced here than in a futuristic adventure like Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow and because classic Hollywood cinema is so rich with epic images of antiquity this cant help but seem chintzy. Still there are some striking ones--a dead tree studded with soldiers bodies hundreds of arrows swarming through the air like flies--though the palette leans mostly toward bluish backgrounds and dark crimson blood spray. Zack Snyder (the Dawn of the Dead remake) directed; intoning dramatically against green screens are Gerard Butler Lena Headey and Dominic West. By J.R.

"300 A Losing Battle in More Ways Than 1 washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On 300 A Losing Battle in More Ways Than 1 Theyre tough theyre buff theyre toast The tale of fierce Spartans is done in by the films graphic novel roots. (Warner Bros. Pictures Via Associated Press) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday March 9 2007 Go tell the Spartans that their sacrifice was not in vain; their long days fight under the cooling shade of a million falling arrows safeguarded the West and guaranteed all these years later the right of idiots to make rotten movies about them. The story has been told and will be told again as long as there are tellers and listeners because most people get it. Even kids get it. But ""300"" -- the new cartoonified version of the hard days work at the Hot Gates on the coast of Greece where 300 stood against a million-man march of Persians--is clueless. The theory of Spartan greatness argues that the Spartans bought time with blood and allowed the other Greek city-state armies to slip away and fight another day and eventually triumph. Thus this frail bloom we call Western civilization continued to survive in the rocky Attic soil. And thus we speak English not Farsi and trace our government back to a neighbor of Spartas. The argument also dramatizes a continuing reality in democratic societies that while its nice to have Athenians around to invent government and theater and the sandal every once in a while its necessary to dig up some Spartans to get in real close and bayonet the bad guys right smack in the guts. ""300"" alas and to its shame makes no argument at all. Its entirely an overblown visual document with an IQ in the lower 20s. It doesnt even bother to mention the strategic context of the Battle of Thermopylae or to follow the story through to its end at Salamis where the Athenians sent the Persian minions to meet Mr. Jones at the bottom of the Aegean and drove the Persian Big Boy Xerxes back to his harem where he ultimately perished on an intriguers knife. Meanwhile the Greeks went on to invent the rest of history. Instead we get a Spartan culture that seems notable primarily for one thing the invention of the ab machine. You never saw so many six-packs in one place outside of a Budweiser warehouse So the movie isnt set in history or in time but in some dank feverish swamp of the imagination that betrays its comic book origins (its based on the graphic novel by ""Sin Citys"" Frank Miller). Some of the problem is a result of the technical Like Robert Rodriguezs ""Sin City"" the movie is one of those computer-painted jobs in which real men do real stuff in a big blue room and then digital artists invent a world around them which can be manipulated tweaked and turned to infinite perversity. Who can care about history when you can spend a hundred hours tuning a geyser of Persian blood until it resembles a tulip opening on Mars? Theres also trouble in the staging The action is all showy and stylized never quite realistic in a kind of van-art gray-brown patina. The director Zack Snyder hasnt a gift for kinetic action and the battle choreography is stilted. He overdoes the slow-mo until it becomes comic and the whole package aestheticizes violence leaching its meaning distancing us. Theres nothing like the horror of the close-in stuff in ""The Seven Samurai"" or ""Zulu"" to name two great battle movies. Anyway the film begins with -- and ends with and uses pretty much as a one-man band -- Leonidas the king played by brawny Scotsman Gerard Butler who has enough charisma to pull it off. (Hes a lot better than Richard Egan in 1962s campy ""The 300 Spartans"" Ill tell you.) He bellows and struts and declaims -- he once played Attila -- and he looks good in spandex and velvet. After establishing Leonidas as a stud among studs (he looks like hes got a seven-pack) the movie gets to its setup the arrival of Persian emissaries to warn the Spartans to give up or face annihilation. The movie plays it one-on-one Sparta vs. Persia to the death and the Spartans make the gathering storm inevitable by kicking the Persian emissaries down a well. So much for diplomatic immunity. In Snyders conceit the Persians represent effeminate decadence. Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) looks like Geoffrey Holder in a photo by Helmut Newton. Theres an androgynous quality to all of them as if their secret mission is to blur the sexes and turn the Spartan studs into women; its unsettling and undoubtedly effective though it would probably bring a smile to Ann Coulters lips. As for the masculine Spartans they could be NFL wide receivers. But . . . oh endless fascinating coils of life -- theyre also kind of gay. The movie has an unmistakable homoerotic undercurrent ripe as the smell of sweat in a locker room. All those hard Nautilus-tortured bodies gleaming greasy smeared with blood those sinewy arms the vein patterns as the camera notices things about the male body that John Ford would find scandalous. Quickly enough Snyder gets us to the action. The Persians land on a Greek beach a million strong but the only way to the heartland is through a narrow pass. That is where they will run into Spartan bronze. In the tight confines of the pass when the men are face to face its pretty equal. Only 300 Persians at a time are able to try the Spartan line so we get war as Ohio State football; three yards and a cloud of blood. Meanwhile and for reasons not historical but purely dramatic the script cuts back to the capital where Leonidass wife Gorgo (Lena Headey) is holding the fort against cut-and-runners led by leering Theron (Dominic West of ""The Wire""). The politics here are strictly BYO Are the cut-and-runners Democrats betraying Leonidas-Bush as he fights the scum of the East or are they moderate Muslims betraying Leonidas-Osama as he fights the scum of the West? You get to make that call. But a bigger question remains and thats why? Why this movie? Its kind of a ghastly hoot but it flees from history and it mocks men who gave so much and while I suppose it does no harm it also contributes nothing. Its a guilty unpleasantness. I just think some moments when history turned on guts and bronze deserve more than a comic book. 300 (105 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for revealing costumes and battle gore.

C- 300 Genre Action/Adventure War; Starring Gerard Butler Vincent Regan Lena Headey Dominic West; Director Zack Snyder; Author Michael Gordon Kurt Johnstad Zack Snyder; Release Date Wide 03/09/2007; Runtime (in minutes) 117; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted March 7 2007 -- 1200 AM EST The Spartans paltry number against the massive forces of King Xerxes Persian army provides the eye-candy comicbook epic 300 with its title. But its impossible to tote up the liters of blood that spill in luxurious slow motion the plasma arcing through the air like tracer fire. Viewed against the copper-tinged landscape and spurting from the wounds of muscular men whose preferred fighting wardrobes are bronze helmets crimson serapes and leather BVDs the gore is brilliant indeed -- the ancient battle of Thermopylae by way of 21st-century digital technology and ab-toning techniques. King Leonidas (Scottish actor Gerard Butler) the revered leader of ancient Greeces most fearless born-to-raise-hell warrior city-state is blessed with perfect teeth great gams and a thrusting dark beard. When he bellows ""Spahhhhrr-TANZ"" in a ripe hybrid Greco-Anglo-Spago accent attention must be paid. For his part Xerxes (Brazilian star Rodrigo Santoro) takes himself deadly seriously as a god. He is a vision in ancient bling and eyeliner with the plucked eyebrows of a nefarious club impresario. I linger over the surfaces of 300 which is closely based on the vivid graphic novel by Frank Miller (Sin City) and Lynn Varley because surfaces most of them computer-generated are all this newfangled sword-and-sandals epic is about. The experience is chilly in its blankness. Sin City after all is a comic book of the most extreme order a futuristic reverie of ultra-noir lawlessness and even a skeptic like myself can appreciate the artistry of experimentation in translating Millers cultish on-the-page imagery to the screen. But 300 has a real historical basis. And the story of the outnumbered Spartans who fought to their deaths (thereby inspiring the rest of Greece to unite in defeating their invaders) is as awesome as any in the history of warfare and nation-building. When watching Leonidas and his men outwit their ferocious adversaries its inevitable to think of Braveheart Saving Private Ryan Letters From Iwo Jima or for that matter The Lord of the Rings or Gladiator -- any high-concept battle pic in which the charge is thrilling and the toll guaranteed to be terrible. Its also inevitable to wish there were some Mel Gibsonian madness in this gleaming techno-chess game of a production. Director and co-screenwriter Zack Snyder who did such a snazzy job reconstituting George Romeros Dawn of the Dead three years ago ramps up his snazz quotient here excited by the challenge of adding a third dimension to Millers strong 2-D style using little more than actors a bluescreen and a massive computer-based post-production army. But in the controlled artfulness of every scene no ragged breath of real ugly human consequence escapes. This is dazzle for the head not the heart. Which is not to say there arent moments of beauty and sensuality pleasurable on their own pop-sexy graphic terms. When at Leonidas request a porn-princess oracle is consulted by the ghoulish Ephors (like a senior center full of scabrous Voldemorts) she rouses from a kind of drug state in a sinuous orgasmic dance essentially naked unless you call wet transparent gossamer fabric a cover-up. Shes a dirty delight -- and a close approximation of Millers original drawings. At home in bed before committing to battle Leonidas and his powerhouse wife Queen Gorgo (The Brothers Grimms Lena Headey a tough beauty) mix serious political pillow talk with serious sexy time -- the other reason aside from operatic violence for the movies R rating. Whats not to like? There will be those who enjoy the way a mans head is severed from his body in a neat Boars Head ham slice of a gesture. Others will dig the scene in which the Spartans create a tactical optical illusion out of a pile of enemy dead -- that is they pile em high crouch behind the stack and then topple the deceased on the heads of the advancing living. (Still more will appreciate the sight of The Wires Dominic West in pageboy hair and leather girdle playing a political weasel who advocates capitulation and Lord of the Rings David Wenham as Leonidas most faithful soldier.) Look but dont be touched There is much to see but little to remember in this telling of a battle we are meant never to forget. And in the emptiness that lurks at the edges of this spectacle there is this movie lovers fear that impersonal computer elegance is the strategy of the future both for studios and soldiers.

"300 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; 300 ) 300 (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli Whatever else 300 may be it is destined to become beloved for a group of devotees. The size of that group will determine whether it achieves mainstream acceptance or attains cult status. Distilled to its essence this is a graphic novel come to life - one of those rare instances in which filmmakers seek not merely to adapt a comic book but to interpret it for the screen. Both approaches are valid and have their strengths but 300 would not be the experience it is had it not clung to the hyper-reality of the images of Frank Millers graphic novel. From a visual standpoint 300 (like Sin City before it) exists at a vertex where comic books and motion pictures intersect. At its most basic 300 is a retelling of the Battle of Thermopylae which took place in 480 B.C. Although the particulars are clouded in legend the facts are not in dispute an inferior number of Spartan soldiers (generally accepted to be 300) under the command of King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) held out against a vastly superior Persian force (estimated to be anywhere between 200000 and 2000000) led by King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro). Although the Spartans did not win the battle they dealt serious losses to the Persians which contributed to the defeat of Xerxes forces a year later at the Battle of Plataea. For 300 director Zack Snyder staying true to the graphic novel emphasizes the mythology of the battle rather than seeking historical accuracy. The resulting texture is more like that of the Battle of Helms Deep in The Two Towers than something one might assume to be a closer kin like the war scenes in Troy. 300 is about heroism in the face of insurmountable odds. It is a masterpiece of images style and testosterone. An ode to masculinity and machismo it captivates the eye and gets the blood pumping. It is heroic spectacle at its finest. Expectedly the movie lacks subtlety and ignores things like characterization. The few characters we come to know are types The Great Warrior-King The Strong Wife The Treacherous Betrayer The Dark Enemy. It should be acknowledged however that the thrust of the movie leaves little room for three-dimensional protagonists and thats not what viewers are looking for anyway. They get what they come for a rousing action/adventure tale that once it gets rolling rarely takes time to catch its breath. Knowing the fate of the Spartans doesnt diminish the bloody exhilaration of getting there. Snyder has dug deep into his bag of tricks in order to make 300 into what it is. His approach is not unlike that of Sin City and Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow in that he uses color desaturation and blue screen background work to craft the films otherworldly look. The film could just as easily be taking place in Middle Earth as in ancient Greece. The men are buff beyond belief with bulging biceps and chiseled chests. The women (or at least the only woman that matters) are voluptuous. There are bare butts (from men) and unclothed breasts (from men and women). Its a cornucopia of flesh. The film also revels in gore although not to the extent one might suppose. There are decapitations and splashes of blood but nothing happens that could be described as especially shocking gruesome or gut-wrenching. The images recall not only the panels of Frank Miller from the graphic novel but the paintings of another Frank - Frank Frazetta the fantasy illustrator who gained popularity with swords-and-sorcery fans by illustrating the iconic covers of various Conan books during the 1960s and 1970s. The cast is populated by character actors - an effective approach because it makes it easier to lose sight of the actors than might be the case if they were readily identifiable. Gerard Butler who plays Leonidas is no screen neophyte. He has starred in big budget productions like The Phantom of the Opera and Tomb Raider II. But his visage is unremarkable and that makes him clay in the filmmakers hands. His performance is larger than life full of passion and vigor - just what the director ordered. Lena Headey plays Leonidas queen a woman of equal strength and passion (although the performance is more restrained). Like Butler she is often seen on the big screen but rarely recognized. The cast is rounded out with names like Dominic West David Wenham (as the narrator Dilios) Vincent Regan and Rodrigo Santoro as Xerxes. All are believable in this setting; none is immediately recognizable. This is not the first movie to be based on The Battle of Thermopylae. 1962s The 300 Spartans told the same story using a different approach. 300 is indirectly inspired by the earlier film; Miller admits that a childhood obsession with The 300 Spartans led to the graphic novel. In nearly every way (except perhaps attempts at historical accuracy which is difficult when the facts are not well known) 300 is a better movie than The 300 Spartans. Its more energetic features better performances and generates a bigger on-screen splash. This is a movie theater film. Audiences deserve to be immersed in what it offers. The pitch Snyder (Dawn of the Dead) used to secure financing is that 300 would change the way ""sword and sandal"" movies were made and viewed. To an extent he is correct 300 is unlike any movie to have previously reached the screen. Its larger-than-life characters frenetic action sequences lush visuals and unabashed embrace of the over-the-top nature of comic books makes it something to be enjoyed in a way that is normally reserved for summer blockbusters. 300 may not offer masterful storytelling in a conventional sense but its hard to beat as a spectacle and that makes it worthwhile viewing for all but the most squeamish of potential audience members. 300 (United States 2007) Director Zack Snyder Cast Gerard Butler Lena Headey Dominic West David Wenham Vincent Regan Rodrigo Santoro Screenplay Zack Snyder amp; Kurt Johnstad and Michael B.

The Spartans fight to the last manly man in ""300"" a blustery bombastic visually arresting account of the Battle of Thermopylae as channeled through the rabid imagination of graphic novelist Frank Miller. Rendered by director Zack Snyder in a manner very similar to last years Miller adaptation ""Sin City"" except in full color this is a steroid-fueled fever dream about self-realization through extreme violence. In the larger picture the cartoonish history lesson inescapably describes a monumental East vs. West conflagration which might be greeted with muted enthusiasm in the Middle East. Action addicts in general and carnivorous fanboys in particular will chow down on this bloody feast. Possibly nowhere outside of gay porn have so many broad shoulders bulging biceps and ripped torsos been seen onscreen as in ""300"" a fact that will generate a certain bonus audience of its own; its not even certain Steve Reeves the original ""Hercules"" would have made the grade here. But then this is Sparta the Greek city-state where boys were separated from their families at age 7 to undergo years of training to forge a population of soldiers unmatched in strength bravery and bloodlust. Often referred to as the Greek Alamo the Battle of Thermopylae remains one of historys great last stands -- a crucial encounter in the summer of 480 B.C. when the invading Persian army under Xerxes often supposed to have numbered 250000-plus was bottled up by the Spartans under Leonidas in a narrow mountain pass by the sea known as the ""gates of hell."" Although all 300 Spartans eventually perished they killed innumerably more Persians and held Xerxes at bay for three days giving other Greek forces valuable time and preventing a Persian takeover of the Hellenic lands. Unsurprisingly little of the conflicts geopolitical import is conveyed in the screenplay by director Zack Snyder (the 2004 ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake) Kurt Johnstad and Michael B. Gordon. A couple of variations to the side script declares intense fidelity to Millers graphic novel which first appeared across five issues of Dark Horse Comics in 1998 and was published in hardcover the following year. Miller was brought to the subject via his childhood enthusiasm for the 1962 feature ""The 300 Spartans"" a somewhat threadbare second-tier epic starring Richard Egan and Ralph Richardson. Miller fans should be more pleased than anyone with what Snyder has wrought as the director made a point of trying to reproduce all the writers visual panels for the film while necessarily expanding them. Approach might explain the claustrophobia that cloaks much of the action as well as the feeling that the film never breathes of its own accord. Although the sort of imagery found here and in ""Sin City"" -- in which actors shot in largely bare studios against blue-screen backdrops interact in dramatically stylized worlds achieved through extraordinary visual effects -- is relatively new in commercial cinema there is also something secondhand and suffocating about it. ""There is no room for softness not in Sparta"" we learn. ""Theres only room for the strong and hard."" This principle applies to no one more than to the king Leonidas (Gerard Butler) a bearded rugged blowhard who after explaining that Spartans are a breed apart from Athenian ""philosophers and boy lovers"" proceeds to toss into a bottomless pit a dark messenger who proposes that he submit to the invincible Xerxes. In the face of religious and oracular warnings to desist Leonidas assembles his best and buffest proceeds past a torched Athens and arrives at the coast where the Persian encampment and fleet extend virtually as far as the eye can see. The battle proper starts 45 minutes in and only periodically abates thereafter occasionally for the Persians to consider their next futile tactic and back in Sparta for its stalwart queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) to overcome the vile maneuverings of council bigshot Theron (Dominic West) so as to send more troops. Accompanied by a score that competes mightily to be heard over the roar of battle and the yelling of combatants the action commences with the promised blackening of the sky by Persian arrows which are successful repelled by the Spartans shields joined together to create a single shell-like armored unit. Attempting a head-on assault the Persians are picked off by Spartan long spears like olives by toothpicks. In a mordant downtime interlude Leonidas men casually roam the battlefield administering the coup de grace to survivors whose corpses are then piled up to form a giant wall their still-living comrades will have to confront to get at the Greeks. The enraged Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) a shaved multipierced and bejeweled weirdo who looks like hed be more at home on the New York club scene than on a battlefield unleashes his metal-masked ""Immortals"" a cretinous giant a charging rhino and giant elephants to little effect. Snyder visualizes the mayhem as graphically and gorily as possible. In contrast to the monochromatic backdrops of ""Sin City"" which were periodically splashed with color at key moments sequences here are color-coordinated according to mood location and timeframe; night scenes might be bathed in blue as in tinted silent films while a passage in a field is rendered in wheat tones. Then theres the blood which flows like wine or a river depending on ones literary mindset. It would be impossible to count the number of soldiers run through with spears swords and arrows and decapitations abound in what finally emerges as an orgy of stylishly orchestrated violence whose only raison detre is the pure expression of a fighting cultures ethos. Seriously pumped up since his starring turn in ""The Phantom of the Opera"" Butler cuts a fine leonine figure but bellows most of his bellicose lines which become tiresomely repetitive as they underscore the obligations and destinies of Spartan fighters. Other male thesps largely declaim to one extent or another so its a relief when Headey is onscreen not only because shes the only female in sight but because of the intelligence and radiant womanliness with which she invests the queen. While her scenes with the adversary played by West are plagued by insufficient exposition and simplistic motivation she shines with a now fully realized beauty and confidence that invite more fulsome opportunities. Availing itself of the latest technical know-how ""300"" is sumptuously realized. Strictly in terms of the dramatic logistics pic could have used some overhead or otherwise orienting shots to clarify the geography just as some visual grace notes expressing genuine human emotion rather than just macho belligerence would have helpfully expanded the films range of impact. 300ProductionA Warner Bros. release presented in association with Legendary Pictures and Virtual Studios of a Mark Canton/Gianni Nunnari production.
