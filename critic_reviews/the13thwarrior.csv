""The 13th Warrior"" emerges from a couple of years on the shelf as a bloody but anemic story of he-men with broad swords and long ships fighting off marauding cannibals dressed in bear skins. Fans of Viking pictures who for years have anxiously anticipated another large-scale entry in the thinly populated genre will at least find their hunger sated temporarily by the rugged action sequences and sporadic butchery. But true satisfaction will have to await another day as Michael Crichtons story is underdeveloped and narrow in range resulting in a tale more curious for its odd confluence of elements than for their edifying deployment. The best that can be hoped for is that the names of Crichton director John McTiernan and lead Antonio Banderas will lure their fans for some good opening-frame figures but women arent likely to respond and commercial downslide looks to be rapid. Although produced in 1997 -- before McTiernans current release ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" -- and the subject of reported significant reworking by co-producer Crichton in recent months ""Warrior"" shows only limited signs of post-production surgery or stitching. There are subsidiary characters and possible subplots notably involving an old Norse king and his treacherous son that were likely pushed to the edges but yarn moves along in orderly three-act fashion and delivers the expected quotient of blood and guts. What William Wisher and Warren Lewis adaptation of Crichtons 1976 novel ""Eaters of the Dead"" also serves up however is an odd combo of civilized rather than primitive-minded talk some vaguely conceived mumbo-jumbo about unmentionable flesh-eating beasts that are soon revealed for what they really are and a promising but finally unrealized contrasting of Western and Eastern cultures circa the 10th century. In the end pic is an old-fashioned potboiler with half-baked serious intentions sprinkled about. The intriguing hero is Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan (Banderas) a highly cultured poet from Baghdad who per Crichton in the production notes was a historical figure who encountered Norsemen during his travels in Central Asia and whose writings provide one of the few firsthand accounts of such people during this period. Here Ibn is exiled to a distant land for coveting the wrong woman but is soon coerced into joining a band of mostly blond fellows who require a non-Nordic 13th warrior to help them fight rampaging fiends who are terrorizing their land. Pic deftly handles the language problem that is normally skirted in such fare by having Ibns traveling companion (Omar Sharif) find a Norseman who speaks some Greek and then translate for the younger man who bides his time attentively until hes absorbed enough of their language to begin speaking it himself whereupon all dialogue slides into English. After a storm at sea the rugged band makes landfall to find that their small community has been slaughtered and partly consumed by horrid creatures who attack in nocturnal mist and leave clawed footprints as big as those of giant bears. The old king of the decimated Norse tribe is fading fast and the attention given to court intrigue is so glancing that one can only suspect major cuts were made in this now-dull material; one victim of this is second-billed Diane Venora who plays the queen and delivers but a handful of meaningless lines. Most of the running time therefore goes to the brawny men and their preparations for the onslaught of marauders that will surely come with the first fog. Eventual nighttime battle is certainly brutal albeit with clear views of the furry invaders avoided much as the Morlocks were obscured in the 1960 version of ""The Time Machine"" so as to prolong ""suspense"" over their true nature. One part of the film aspires to be a sort of Middle Ages ""Night of the Living Dead"" but McTiernan shows no interest in maximizing the creepy tension inherent in the plight of a handful of terrified people waiting for the ghastly attack they know is coming; instead of quietly building a sense of dread pic remains overbusy and loud thanks in part to Jerry Goldsmiths insistently bombastic score. There is hacking and impaling aplenty as well there might be but pic falls short on all the other fronts where it had chances to excel. Ibn is presented as a devout Mohammedan whose spiritual and artistic bents are meant to contrast with the more primitive and pagan ways of his temporary comrades. A few uncouth habits to the side however the forest men behave in a remarkably rational and reasonable manner that provides meager conflict with the attitudes of their sophisticated guest. It is not surprising then that the film conjures up little sense of a barbaric and starkly terrifying time and place. On the visual side too pic is not all it might have been; the requisite action is up there on the screen but the compositions of McTiernan and lenser Peter Menzies Jr. lack boldness and true epic stature. In the sort of role that might once have been played by Tyrone Power or Victor Mature Banderas cuts a fine figure with his black robes and white horse and becomes picturesquely scarred over the course of the various battles. The Norsemen have names that will have the former Monty Python players drooling over missed opportunities -- Herger the Joyous Skeld the Superstitious Helfdane the Large and so on -- but theyre a mostly amiable bunch who arent unamusing to be around. Ultimately pic is not as bad as its long hibernation period suggested but it does count as a more or less muffed opportunity in a genre that could use some fresh ideas. Heavily wooded British Columbian locations substitute plausibly for northern Euro settings.

Aieeee If the juiciest bouts of professional wrestling on television leave you feeling unfulfilled and pining for the primal howls of fight-to-the-death combat ""The 13th Warrior"" just might be the answer to your prayers. And unlike professional wrestling it is saturated in purgative gore. More than once the movie gives you the delirious thrill of ripping off your enemys head and watching the blood gush by providing a ringside seat. Sanctified by Jerry Goldsmiths pounding score -- the symphonic equivalent of heavy metal -- such feats of carnage seem almost heroic when carried out in a misty mountain landscape redolent of pure myth (the movie was filmed in British Columbia) by warriors who resemble the hair-band rock gladiators of the 1970s and 80s.

The 13th Warrior arrives trailing talk that director John McTiernan -- who made this restless beaut before The Thomas Crown Affair -- is unhappy with the final cut wrangled by Michael Crichton upon whose 1976 novel Eaters of the Dead its based. Yet this richly blood- and mud-splattered film prowls and leaps with such unfettered unself-consciously propulsive energy and style that its hard to imagine just what McTiernan objects to except perhaps that anyone is left standing after the last glorious battle sequence. Banderas plays Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan a refined fellow banished from Baghdad because he looked funny at the wife of an important nobleman. Wandering abroad with his mentor (Omar Sharif) he meets a boatload of blond blocky uncultured Norsemen -- played predominantly by European actors unknown to Americans -- who enlist him in the battle against terrifying enemy troops so murderous they eat their victims. (A soothsayer encourages the Men from the North to take a 13th warrior who isnt one of them.) Thats it for exposition. The power of The 13th Warrior lies in the almost pointillistic nearly word-free way in which McTiernan paints each mans personality and brings the band together all the while conveying the horrors of combat that havent changed much since the old days when fantastical ursine hordes spooked the populace. Once Ahmed sets off nervously with his new colleagues theres not a moment when the camera isnt swinging slicing and revealing glimpses of visually mesmerizing mysteries and paring each character to its dramatic essentials. (In the company of Scandinavians Banderas liquid intensity has been smelted to its purest state.) That this cut despite rumored directorial objections conveys heroism brutality and the indelible mark of superior filmmaking leaves open the question What would The 13th Warrior have been had McTiernan won the war?

Starring Antonio Banderas. Directed by John McTiernan. (R. 103 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Anyone who needs a sublimated- violence fix ought to try ""The 13th Warrior."" Well it beats road rage. Theres enough macho head- banging -- to say nothing of complete decapitation -- to satisfy anyone. This Antonio Banderas adventure thriller is big on fur-and-leather atmospherics heavy clanking and teeth-gnashing. Theres also a wailing deep-horn soundtrack. Banderas plays a 10th century Arab aristocrat who much to his surprise finds himself the 13th man on a team of pagan Norse roughnecks. The ferocious tattooed warriors must save a small northern kingdom from demonic bearlike marauders. Think of it as a Viking ""Seven Samurai."" Without unfortunately the Akira Kurosawa touch. It falls short where it counts in the final confrontation. The last battle is preceded and upstaged by a much more thrilling guerrilla attack on the evil creatures den -- an enormous cave carved by rushing water. Director John McTiernan (""Die Hard"" ""The Thomas Crown Affair"") might have left it at that. Even with some obviously chopped-up scenes the movie seems stretched out as it approaches the end of its 103 minutes and someone must have noticed they hadnt got around to the Big Bang yet. Now except for the ominous torch- lit advance of the mounted creatures it comes off as perfunctory. Someone also must have noticed that theres barely a love interest for Banderas in this testosterone-heavy epic. His dalliance with the unbleached muslin-clad Maria Bonnevie is little more than a quickie. Where ""The 13th Warrior"" works best is in creating an atmosphere of totemic paganism in the mysterious mist-enshrouded northern forest. The monotheistic Muslim played by Banderas is the odd man out in this hairy band of blond pantheistic Vikings. They are played by a striking assortment of Scandinavian actors. The courtly Muslim is also a quick study. In a transition that the viewer can see coming and is probably all the more fun for it the Norsemen gradually stop speaking their native tongue and segue into English. He can also ""draw sounds"" -- i.e. write. The film is based on ""Eaters of the Dead"" by Michael Crichton who says he relied on some details of historical writings by the roving Baghdad ambassador Ibn Fahdlan. When the cannibalistic ursine creatures are finally revealed in their cave in the films most theatrical sequence their eerie earthbound fundament seems to reach deep into the roots of the prehistoric psyche. Banderas may not be a natural action star -- he is one of the few from whom the audience may want more talk and less action. He is surely neck-and-neck with Rupert Everett for the most beautiful voice in movies today. His sincere performance earns credence for a moving Mus lim prayer he ultimately delivers. Banderas still can swing a mean sword (apparently all that training he got from Anthony Hopkins in ""The Mask of Zorro"" stuck). In the best action sequence however the blond-bearded Herger the Joyous (Dennis Storhoi) taunts a red-haired giant into one-on-one combat. Didnt anyone ever tell Joyous not to mess with a redhead? ..
