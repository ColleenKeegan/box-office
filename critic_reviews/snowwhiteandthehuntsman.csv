Not necessarily better but different.Where Tarsem created an ersatz theatrical Neverland and lodged his tongue firmly in his cheek debut feature director Rupert Sanders plays the familiar story entirely straight integrates spectacular shape-shifting CGI effects within the natural world and re-imagines Snow White as a kind of revolutionary leader. The main character in ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is more Joan of Arc than Barbie princess. This is an altogether less girly fairytale with epic battles chase sequences through castle sewers and a romance so tentative its barely there.Still if Sanders is squeamish when it comes to the lovey-dovey stuff he gives Charlize Theron her head as the evil Queen Ravenna. Not just a wicked witch Ravenna is a monstrous gargoyle of feminine wiles a spiritual vampire who feeds on others youthful vitality and leaves them old and wizened in her stead. Photos Photos Snow White and the Huntsman - Kristen Stewart is the latest in a long line of actresses play Snow White.

I would suggest not. Freud needs fairy tales more than fairy tales need any intervention from him but in any case Theron makes a magnificently malevolent b with a customized crown of horns to accompany each and every wardrobe. This is a real performance sculpted and thought-through; Theron gives the picture some spine.As Snow White Kristen Stewart supplies the heart. She immediately cuts a more self-confident figure than Collins. She wears leggings underneath her gowns and she isnt about to play housemaid to any dwarves either. Stewart -- like Theron -- carries off a serviceable English accent and mostly refrains from those irritating Bella-isms but its not so easy to take her seriously as the messianic resistance leader that Sanders seems to have in mind (you get the feeling the director thinks hes auditioning for the next ""Narnia"" movie or even Middle Earth).Meanwhile ""Thor"" hunk Chris Hemsworth extends his range by swapping his hammer for an axe and almost losing a fight now and then.Despite some polishing from big-name screenwriters John Lee Hancock (""The Blind Side"") and Hossein Amini (""Drive"") Evan Daughertys screenplay is more functional than fun. Theres not much in the way of sparkling wit or even idle banter to punctuate the action.But the movies visuals sing. Director of photography Greig Fraser (""Bright Star""; ""Let Me In"") conjures spellbinding images of rugged castles and English marshlands and the CGI is so organic to this landscape that we hardly blink when a tree stump reveals itself as a giant troll. The Dark Woods are a hallucinogenic nightmare of scuttling creatures and pustulated swamps while an interlude in ""Fairyland"" is pure kitsch but charmingly imaginative Toadstools have eyes and flower petals transform into fluttering butterflies.As for the seven dwarves -- I almost forget -- theyre played Hobbit-style by the usually non-dwarfish likes of character actors Bob Hoskins Ian McShane Ray Winstone Brian Gleeson Nick Frost Toby Jones and Eddie Marsan. Its a shame to have assembled a cast like that and given them so little to do. Again the CGI is seamless and kudos to the hair and make-up department but there was more warmth and wonder back in Disneys hand-drawn animation. Heigh-ho.""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is rated PG-13 and is not suitable for younger children.Powered by LivefyreHomeU.S.Crime + JusticeEnergy + EnvironmentExtreme WeatherSpace + ScienceWorldAfricaAmericasAsiaEuropeMiddle East2016 ElectionWashingtonNationWorldMarketsTechMediaPersonal FinanceLuxuryOpinionPolitical Op-EdsSocial CommentaryHealthDiet + FitnessLiving WellParenting + FamilyEntertainmentCelebrity WatchTV + WebMovies + MusicTechGadgetsCyber SecurityInnovation NationFashionDesignArchitectureAutosLuxuryTravelBest of TravelSleeps + EatsBusiness TravelAviation + BeyondPro FootballCollege FootballBasketballBaseballSoccerLivingFoodRelationshipsReligionVideoLive TV Digital StudiosCNN FilmsTV ScheduleTV Shows A-ZMore...PhotosLongformInvestigationsiReportCNN profilesCNN LeadershipCNN NewslettersU.S. EditionSet edition preferenceU.S.InternationalConfirmU.S.InternationalArabicEspanol(c) 2016 Cable News Network.

An empress of narcissism Ravenna insists on being ""the fairest of all"" and its a wonder that she never fire-bombs Donald Trumps hair. For a long time she looks more fair than Snow White (Kristen Stewart) but the younger beauty has a classy advantage because Stewart also projects kindness and courage. Rupert Sanderss big fantasy lumbers at first as if trying to cram The Adventures of Robin Hood into Lord of the Rings. But then Snow White crystallizes her regal destiny helped by the hunky Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth who seems like a slightly obtuse Sean Connery). The story enters a magic forest where mushrooms have eyes and fairies sprout from birds. Gnarly but manly dwarves are acted with digital help by such delightful British veterans as Bob Hoskins Eddie Marsan Ian McShane Ray Winstone and Toby Jones. The little guys should all be knighted Sir Dwarf. This film may be less for fairy tale fans than action buffs who think the Middle Ages was just a long dirty rehearsal for Tolkien blockbusters. The dialogue wears some clanking armor (""I would rather die today than live another day of this death"") but the movie entertains. Strong effects good design and an exciting use of nature help to empower Stewart and Theron who inject a rich double dose of feminism.

Thats what I asked myself while suffering through Snow White and the Huntsman a putrid and seemingly endless retelling of the famous fairy tale. Grim and gruesome its a soul-sucking two-hour-plus endurance test that parents should avoid taking their kids to see except as an extreme form of punishment. I cant imagine who the filmmakers envisioned as their target audience. Is it a date movie? I dont think so. Its really not for children either unless they happen to be members of the Addams Family. Why? Early in the story (spoiler alert) we actually see the evil Queen plunge an enormous dagger into Snow Whites fathers chest. Thats mild compared to the dark doings that follow from closeups of icky insects and dead birds to a village of women and children cruelly set ablaze. Charlize Theron plays the ravenous narcissistic queen without an iota of shading or nuance. It is certainly her loudest performance but the constant shouting grows tiresome. Kristen Stewart does her best as the pure innocent Snow White and Chris Hemsworth is beefy and likable as the huntsman who becomes her protector. If you dont walk out of the movie (as I was sorely tempted to do) youll eventually get to meet the seven dwarfs who are played in a bit of movie magic by such familiar full-sized British actors as Bob Hoskins Ray Winstone Toby Jones and Eddie Marsan. This touch of whimsy is welcome but comes too late to rescue the dark-hearted movie. The screenplay is credited to three separate writers which is usually the sign of a long or troubled production. Given the ponderous nature of this film and its refusal to come to a conclusion it may simply be that the producers used all of their material. The director Rupert Sanders is known for his TV commercials which should have taught him something about brevity. Incidentally if youre wondering why were being punished with a parade of revisionist fairy tales the apparent reason is that Hollywood sensed a hit in the making when Tim Burtons Alice in Wonderland went into production and wound up making a huge pile of money two years ago. That got various producers thinking that the world was eager to see new renderings of Red Riding Hood Hansel and Gretel and a string of other public-domain fairy tales and fables...but its cockeyed logic. I suspect most people went to see Alice because it looked appealing and featured Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter. The only positive thought I can muster is that this movie will never eclipse Walt Disneys animated classic which has brought joy to millions of viewers for the past 75 years. Disney was brilliant in his juxtaposition of light and dark story elements but he never let the dark side overtake his films. Thats why we feel a surge of happiness when goodness triumphs at the end. Snow White and the Huntsman simply stops and I felt nothing except relief.

Really awful. Kristen Stewart or whatever is her name is such a poor actress I cant believe all her success (I wont say anything about her ugliness this time). Of course the director wanted a rapid one or perhaps has the same taste because this film is in fact his baby but a deformed one. With a decent director this movie could have been a way lot better. Certainly the director whoever he is really loved The Lord of the Rings and Luc Bessons Joan Darc for moments he tried and only got some worthless copycat scenes tries of those 2 films. He failed and failed and failed again and... here we go again with another defeat while filming this... crap. I would be surprised if someone would give him another huge (in budget but not in quality) movie. (Relax with my grammar and vocabulary I am a Spaniard whos never have been in UK or USA). Reply Elly May 22 2016 1257 am Just saw it today. It was so boring that I wanted to leave halfway through but I stayed because the ticket too expensive for me to potentially miss the moment when It Gets Better which never came. I have only one good thing to say... the people who put together the trailer were masters of seduction. Reply mike schlesinger May 22 2016 1257 am Finally caught up with this and all I can say is Leonard you were too kind Well and this Theron is a guaranteed winner in any Shatner impression contest ""I...WANT...HER...FOUND"" Reply Sanya May 22 2016 1257 am I found this movie quite dark for my taste. Iam a firm lover of romantic flicks. I went to Waves to watch this movie in the hope that Iall get a little bit of fairytale effect. But to my dismay couldnat find it. Moreover Kristen Stewart was totally blaah Not really one of my best movies Reply Comments claire baker May 22 2016 1257 am I wished Id read your review Leonard before going to see this film with my 12 year old daughter - I HAVE just walked out of this Snow White after 30 minutes of shocking gore AND wasted APS14 It was definitely NOT suitable for a young audience - nothing was left to the imagination Feel angry and cheated Reply Dirk May 22 2016 1257 am Try watching Prometheus before you see this movie. Youll like Snow White better. I thought this was a perfectly entertaining retelling of the story. Its certainly not Disney. Reply mister rengerz May 22 2016 1257 am Yeah boy LM layin the smack-ith down on this flick Reply Stephen Saldanha May 22 2016 1257 am I agree with everything here the story is incredibly boring apart from Nick Frost non of the characters are likable and if I had one good thing to say about this film it would be the CGI I think they did a pretty good job with one. Reply Teri May 22 2016 1257 am Mr. Maltin thank you for saying exactly how I felt On other sites folks are going on and on about how great this movie is and I have to step back and ask ""did they see a different version?"" LOL Awful and very disappointing. Thank you for telling us what is really was Reply Matthew May 22 2016 1257 am Mr. Maltin is very correct. This movie was horrible. Even as the main character Kristen never had more then one sentence for lines save one monologue scene. This movie is lacking in plot and charlieze theron seems to be so mad in this movie. Apparently she knew how bad it would turn out. Reply Andrew May 22 2016 1257 am Mr. Maltin dont take this the wrong way because youre one of my favorite film critics. I highly respect your opinion. But how can you be so hard on this film for being so dark yet give Snow White A Tale Of Terror ""even darker"" 3 stars? I dont get it? I saw this film last night and I thought it was great And for dealing with such dark subject matter it was never grim atleast for me. Even Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper gave it highly positive reviews but everyone reacts to films defferently. We disagree on this film sharply but your still one of my favorite critics =) Reply mike schlesinger May 22 2016 1257 am I suspect MIRROR MIRROR is looking a bit better now ;-) Reply Tom Murphy May 22 2016 1257 am To those who thank LM for saving them from this film never let one mans opinion prevent u from seeing a film. U will lose out. As 4 SWATH it was never meant 2b a kid film. It is 4 adults. I found it well made amp; very good. Thats 2 good films 4 Hemsworth. Reply Norm May 22 2016 1257 am Really find the comments interesing Pro amp; Con...The people who found the movie viewable arent put off by the violence and darkness...Hhmmm...The people who agree with LM probably share the same values...I propose a compromise...A Double Bill of "" Snow White amp; The Huntsman and the Original film "" I Spit on Your Grave."" Just in time for the holidays...What A treat... Reply Cher May 22 2016 1257 am Just caught SWATH and enjoyed it overall. While the pacing was a little slow at times the visual effects were very well done and Kristen Stewart carried off the role of warrior girl Snow White quite well. The movie could have used a bit more romance humor or suspense and more Chris Hemsworth but it was generally entertaining. Reply Nat Segaloff May 22 2016 1257 am Gee Leonard you took this movie personally. And you were quite right that Walt never let the darkness overwhelm the light which is as astute observation given that the Grimm Andersen Perrault Arabian Nights Chinese and other classic fairy tales are essentially dark but (heres my point) tend to go with the light characters. This is why 007 movies always take Bonds side not the villains (except for Austin Powers). Turning a narrative fabric inside-out only works if theres a silver lining (sorry). Reply Jim Reinecke May 22 2016 1257 am Sounds as if even SNOW WHITE AND THE THREE STOOGES would be preferable to this mess (There. . .I kept it brief and Ive never directed a commercial in my life) Reply Lillian May 22 2016 1257 am Thank you Leonard for giving me over 2 extra hours of life...I was thinking of seeing Snow White but already had doubts. Thanks for the gift of time. LILLIAN Reply Alex May 22 2016 1257 am I dont know if you are oblivious but they never said this was a kid friendly movie. Its obvious that from the trailer it was a darker less ""disney"" and more of Grimms version of the fairytale. Reply Jenna May 22 2016 1257 am Wow just got home from seeing SWATH and I loved it. Although I love the classic fairy tales too it never occurred to me that this would be anything like the classic Walt Disney fairy tale. Particularly since all the promos leading up were pretty clear this is not the Snow White you grew up with nor did I want it to be. Im not really interested in full-on remakes of classics. This was a film Ive never watched before-fresh dark with a Joan of Arc kinda feel. Most films lately seem regurgitated and stale with the same kind of crazy effects but not this. This was was so beautiful and the effects were new and visually stimulating. Love the original and hold it dear. So Im grateful this team didnt try to put together anything like it. This is exactly what I was looking for and it exceeded my expectations. Always appreciate your reviews but I respectfully disagree.

"Snow White and the Huntsman | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; snow-white-and-the-huntsman ) Snow White and the Huntsman (United States 2012) June 01 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli Lets start out by not dwelling overmuch on the existence of Mirror Mirror. The basic story outline may be the same but the similarities end there. Everything of importance is different tone intent plot specifics and so forth. Mirror Mirror is a family film with occasional bursts of Time Bandits-inspired comedy. Snow White and the Huntsman is a darker more serious endeavor - a fantasy-tinged action/adventure tragedy that may disappoint traditionalists expecting something more child-friendly. The participation of Kristen Stewart will garner some attention from the Twilight crowd although this incarnation of Snow White is 180 degrees from the passive chronically victimized Bella Swan. Imagine if you will Bella dressed in armor and swinging a sword. Theres something almost Shakespearean about this movie. The three leads are emotionally damaged and spend a great deal of time trying to work through some issues. All could use a weekly therapy session but they find ways to compensate. At times Snow White and the Huntsman is almost too grim for its own good. Its not a lot of fun and the heroic element drowns in the leaden atmosphere. Attempts to inject a little humor via the antics of the dwarves dont work especially since one of the little people is killed early in the proceedings. No ones going to be singing ""Hi ho Hi ho Its off to work we go"" after that happens. Snow White and the Huntsman includes plenty of PG-13 violence with creatures that would be at home in The Lord of the Rings The Chronicles of Narnia or Harry Potter. The larger battle sequences of which there are several are perfunctory suffering by comparison with the long gritty detailed conflicts presented in Peter Jacksons films. Visually however Snow White and the Huntsman is splendid arguably offering a more eye-popping experience than the fantastical world created by Tarsem in Mirror Mirror. First-time director Rupert Sanders treats his cinematic canvas like a grand playground allowing his imagination to run free with the aid of CGI. An evocative sequence in which a flock of crows comes together to form the queen is emblematic of Sanders visual sense. Whether or not he can direct actors with equal expertise remains an open question; Snow White and the Huntsman does not provide sufficient evidence to assign a grade. The story follows a trajectory that is generally familiar. Snow White (Kristen Stewart) grows up an orphan under the thumb of the cruel beautiful Queen Ravella (Charlize Theron) who married Snows father then killed him on their wedding night. Snow is kept prisoner in the castles north tower while Ravella terrorizes her subjects. When an opportunity to escape presents itself Snow seizes it fleeing into the Dark Forest. There she meets The Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth carrying an ax instead of a hammer) who agrees - for a price - to convey her to the estate of the rebel duke who is sheltering refugees from Ravellas purges. Along the way they encounter a troll fairies a band of dwarves (initially numbering eight) and a white hart while being pursued by the queens brother Finn (Sam Spruell) and his elite corps. By the way the Ravella/Finn relationship may call to mind that of siblings Cersei and Jamie in Game of Thrones. A sexual liaison is not explicitly revealed (to do so would result in an automatic ""R"" from the MPAA) but it is hinted at. The films most strident performance belongs to Charlize Theron who emphasizes Ravellas evil by shouting every line of dialogue. A traumatic childhood and reliance upon soul-sucking magic have leeched all humanity from the queen; her inevitable end will make the castle a quieter place. Theron is fine in scenes when she has no lines such as one in which the queen disrobes and immerses herself in what looks like a milk bath but when speaking shes often too over-the-top to convey true menace. Chris Hemsworth offers a low-key portrayal as the titular Huntsman allowing the tragedy that haunts the character to inform his every action and decision. Its a nice understated piece of acting. Unfortunately Kristen Stewart perhaps still experiencing a thespian hang-over from spending so much time appearing in Twilight movies is flat. Her Snow White is the least interesting character unless you count her potential love interest William (Sam Claflin). The dwarves are played by normal-sized actors like Ian McShane Bob Hoskins and Ray Winstone who have been miniaturized by special effects. Snow White and the Huntsmans romance appears to have been modeled after the Luke/Han/Leia love triangle with Snow torn between the mercenary Huntsman (whose reasons for helping her change from monetary to personal over the course of the film) and the heroic good-hearted (and boring) William. It becomes obvious who the ""winner"" is when we see whose kiss awakens her from the poison apples spell. The love story is kept in the background and is not used as a hook to attract would-be female viewers. Expectations for Snow White and the Huntsman might determine its reception. The movie with its ominous subjects and dark stylish execution may prove to be unpalatable to those who crave lighter fare. Then again Chris Nolans Batman movies have not been hampered by a bleak tone. As far as live-action reimaginings of fairy tales are concerned this is one of the more inventive ones and is unquestionably better than 2011s Red Riding Hood misfire. And for those who think Snow White and the Huntsman is too scary for young kids theyre right. But theyre not called the Brothers Grimm for nothing.

I kept.waiting on real emotions from her and got none. The final fight and ending were lame. It looked as if the story was building up to this big speech were snow white claimed her throne and thanked her subjects. Then nothing. Lisasaid on Friday February 22 2013 73705 PMPeople who say that Kristen Stewart isnt a good actress clearly dont know a teeny tiny bit about talent Her talent is so very unique not like all these others mainstream wannabe actresses Jerome Msaid on Wednesday January 30 2013 92558 PMPG ""Kristen Stewart was amazing."" Seriously? Its not a ""Potter vs Twilight"" thing. Its a talent thing. But people like you who care more about silly fads than meaningful art are exactly why an embarrassingly awful actress like Stewart was cast opposite an Academy Award winner. The movie makers knew the Stewart fan club would pay to see their film. End of story. Sarasaid on Thursday November 15 2012 104300 PMThis movie could have been much better if Kristen Stewart was a better actress. Simple as that. Charleze Theron was absolutely amazing along with everyone else. The whole film was filled with sparadic sentimental scenes ment to develop the characters but mostly consisted of Stewarts blank stares. All of this led up to a sub-par battle and false hopes of an epic speech from Stewart in the end. Sorshasaid on Saturday June 23 2012 123102 PMOne of the worst movies in recent memory much thanks to Stewart. Her blank stare wooden acting drags this movie and what brilliant performances are here down. Blank stare with tilt of head=concern; blank stare with mouth slightly opened=shock; blankstare with slight squint=sadness... You get the point. A strong work ethic means nothing if you dont have the talent to back it. Watching kristen try to rally a kingdom is one of te more embarassing things to see on film. Only redeeming factor here is Theron who could have easily made this a one note character but gives depth and subtext to a tragic queen. Chris does a great job as huntsman with lots of depth and motivation. The dwarves and all other characters are one note. We know nothing of the dwarves indicidually. Forced comic relief. Bob hopkins delivery is unintentionally laughable. Story is so cliched and bland in grand scheme of things. Snow white runs from queen get help. Comes back to dethrone queen. PGsaid on Sunday June 17 2012 20705 PMEmma Watson as Snow White is laughable. She has NEVER carried a major film or any film on her own. Sounds like a bit of a Potter v Twilight hating going on. Kristen Stewart was amazing and the film is an A- Firstly the critics concern was her accent why? It was beyond me considering her leading man for the past 4 years was British and her boyfriend but I digress. She nailed it. Secondly every distinguished British actor in the film i.e. the dwarves from Bob Hoskins to Ray Winstone to Johnny Harris all of them have been IMPRESSED with Kristen. They have done nothing but praised her work in every interview they have given. You need only go to YouTube. If these men are so impressed with her and her work ethic who is anyone else to judge? They know. Thirdly the film was beautifully made. The cinematography rivals any Oscar winning film. The costumes were outstanding. Definite Oscar nod for the special effects as well. Fourthly the cast was incredible. The relationship between Charlize Therons amp; Sam Spruells characters set the tone for the film from the start. Spruell was amazing henchman. Chris Hemsworth showed a range of different levels to his character which made the ending even more sweeter. Kristen showed a range as well being compassionate strong beautiful sensitive loving and more. Snow White did not need to speak because her actions showed everything. She was the one and Kristen conveyed it in every frame. Lastly the director hit every note. The scale and beauty of the film was amazing This was first class all the way. The cast the crew the filmmakers...everyone. This will become a cult classic...wait and see. Loved it. Ive seen it 7 times and every time Ive gone the audience was filled with as many guys as there were females. It crosses audiences nicely. Cannot wait for the sequel Stevensaid on Tuesday June 12 2012 25725 PMIm surprised theres only one comment. I thought the movie was pretty decent I personally would of given it a B- for the reason that it really drags at parts and I felt they should of recasted Snow White. Kristen Stewart just didnt stand out I felt Emma Watson would of been more fit but Charlize Theron dominated. Its still an very fun movie. Francessaid on Saturday June 02 2012 24333 PMNot being a professional movie critic I really enjoyed the movie Snow White/Huntsman. The cinematography and scenery were fantastic; the costumes fabulous - especially Snow Whites and the Queens. The fairy tale forrest with its cute bunnies birds white deerand scary monster fascinating and surreal(reminiscent of Avatar). The characters Snow White (Kristen Stewarts appearancevoice and accent lovely (when she spoke). The writers should have given her more dialogue; a chance to champion the theme of good overcomes evil. The Huntsmans (Chris Hemsworth)fighting abilities were admirable - and understated romance with Snow White believable. The Evil Queen (Charlize Theron) with her CGI wizardry was quite a spectacle. The Princes archery skills were on target. POST A COMMENT indicates required fieldName Email Website YouTubeResponse URL  ?

Universal PicturesBella Venezia from Italy. Nourie Hadag from Armenia. Gold-tree from Scotland. These and other variations on the story of Snow White (Aarne-Thompson folklore classification No. 709 for those keeping score at home) have been told countless times and in countless forms plays novels TV shows comic books Japanese anime. Snow White has spawned more than one horror movie and inevitably adult films both animated and live-action. But forget those for now and forget too Tarsem Singhs ill-conceived Mirror Mirror from earlier this year. The Grimms old fable may form the backbone for Snow White and the Huntsman the feature-film debut of director Rupert Sanders but hes aiming for something larger and more epic for Middle Earth for Narnia for Westeros. And while Sanders does not quite hit his bullseye hes not terribly far off. If you like me were disheartened when Guillermo del Toro detached himself from directing The Hobbit you may find some measure of consolation here. Sanders does not (yet) share del Toros gifts but he too has an eye for the beautiful and the grotesque and for that entrancing borderline where the two meet a verdant glade where the mushrooms have eyes; an Ent-like beast resembling four tons of predatory landscape; a villain who when struck bursts into a murder (has the term ever seemed more apt?) of crows. Related Story Fairy Tales Started Dark Got Cute and Are Now Getting Dark Again The rudiments of the story are all in place A king and queen have a beloved and beautiful daughter named Snow White (Kristen Stewart) and while she is still a girl the queen dies. The filmmakers have turned the dials up to 11 however when it comes to the wicked stepmother Ravenna (Charlize Theron) who takes the queens place. We first encounter Ravenna launching an attack on the kingdom with a small band of obsidian warriors; when her forces are defeated she poses as their helpless brutalized captive. The king moved by pity and something stronger than pity quickly brings her into his castle and into his bed. There alas his coitus is promptly interruptussed by the dagger she plants in his chest. Ravenna opens the city gates brings in her genuine army and begins her dark reign. Its a trick we learn she has performed many times before. Ravennas great beauty is timeless or at least subject to regular refurbishment. This she accomplishes in part by bathing in a thick milky liquid (shades of the Hungarian Countess Erzsebet Bathorys reputed baths in virgins blood). And as any serious beauty regimen requires more than a single component she also has a habit of sucking the youth Dementor-like out of the odd pretty girl now and then. One such prematurely wizened lass winds up in a castle cell across the hall from our heroine Snow White face to face with a living portrait of Dorian Gray. Snow White escapes the castle by way of the sewers like Andy Dufresne flushing himself out of Shawshank State Prison. One conveniently located pale white horse later (there were some audience titters over this) she finds herself in The Dark Forest which is just as unappealing as you might suppose from the name animated trees toxic vapors beetle hordes bats and things worse than bats. The queens men fear the forest themselves so the queen hires a hunter familiar with the woods (Chris Hemsworth) to find Snow White and to bring her back. He accomplishes the former but has second thoughts about the latter.Sanders has an eye for the beautiful and the grotesque and for that entrancing borderline where the two meet. And so it spins outward with Snow White and her Huntsman fleeing trailed by soldiers led by Ravennas doting brother (and yes theres more than a whiff of Cersei and Jaime Lannister to the relationship between the blond royal siblings). One by one the familiar trappings are rolled out the magic mirror the dreamless slumber that begins with an apple and ends with a kiss and of course the dwarves. Lest you recoil at this last thought let me assure you that against all probability the dwarves are among the best elements of the film. Surely comparable talent has never been assembled in seven packages so small however much they may be reduced by digital wizardry Ian McShane Ray Winstone Toby Jones Nick Frost Eddie Marsan and Bob Hoskins (in one of his best roles in decades). And if that last dwarf Gus bears a nagging resemblance to Brendan Gleeson that would be because hes played by the great Dubliners son Brian. Would that the regular-sized characters were quite so memorable. Hemsworth is sturdy but unremarkable as the Huntsman having traded in Thors hammer for a hatchet. Theron is rather a disappointment her chilly regal beauty giving way to a few decidedly smaller-than-life hissy fits. And two British Sams--Spruell and Claflin respectively--do yeomans work as Ravennas smirky brother and Snow Whites would-be champion.And Kristen Stewart? Im no particular fan but I found her performance adequate--at least until she offers her tepid variation on the St. Crispins Day speech. Yes she still seems more Bella that Katniss and this Snow White is no Bella. But Stewart largely disavows the tics and tells her best-known role entailed--the gnawed-on lip the downcast eyes--in favor of a more forthright relationship with the camera. And while it is true that her girl-next-door prettiness is a somewhat awkward fit for the title of ""fairest of them all""--especially compared to Therons glimmering perfection--the contrast is clearly deliberate.Still Snow White and the Huntsman rises (mostly) and falls (occasionally) on the vision of director Sanders. Some no doubt will object to the films self-seriousness and lack of intentional humor. And its true we must suffer through such clunkers as ""The land died and with it hope"" and ""Her innocence and purity can destroy you"" for just over two hours--about 15 minutes longer than would be optimal.Its the look of the film that ultimately lingers though. Shot largely in Wales in multitudinous shades of gray (a convenient intersection with faddish fiction) Snow White and the Huntsman is a credit to the visual imagination of Sanders and cinematographer Greig Fraser (Bright Star the upcoming Killing Them Softly). The movie offers a Jacksonian--thats Peter not Andrew--sense of scale and topography and tucked within it a litany of small wonders a downy emerald snake covered with moss a great white stag with tree limbs for antlers a tiny fishing village enshrouded first in mist and later in fire. This directorial debut from Sanders is not for everyone and not without flaw. But it offers powerful glimpses of what might yet be to come.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

Graham The Fox hosts insistence that black laborers building the White House were ""well-fed and had decent lodgings"" fits in a long history of insisting the ""peculiar institution"" wasnt so bad. In her widely lauded speech at the Democratic National Convention on Monday Michelle Obama reflected on the remarkable fact of her African American family living in the executive mansion. ""I wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves. And I watch my daughters two beautiful intelligent black young women playing with their dogs on the White House lawn"" she said. On Tuesday Fox News host Bill OReilly discussed the moment in his Tip of the Day. In a moment first noticed by the liberal press-tracking group Media Matters OReilly said this As we mentioned Talking Points Memo Michelle Obama referenced slaves building the White House in referring to the evolution of America in a positive way. It was a positive comment. The history behind her remark is fascinating. George Washington selected the site in 1791 and as president laid the cornerstone in 1792. Washington was then running the country out of Philadelphia. Slaves did participate in the construction of the White House. Records show about 400 payments made to slave masters between 1795 and 1801. In addition free blacks whites and immigrants also worked on the massive building. There were no illegal immigrants at that time. If you could make it here you could stay here. In 1800 President John Adams took up residence in what was then called the Executive Mansion. It was only later on they named it the White House. But Adams was in there with Abigail and they were still hammering nails the construction was still going on. Slaves that worked there were well-fed and had decent lodgings provided by the government which stopped hiring slave labor in 1802. However the feds did not forbid subcontractors from using slave labor. So Michelle Obama is essentially correct in citing slaves as builders of the White House but there were others working as well. Got it all? There will be a quiz. Continue Reading The Tiny Irish Island That Will Welcome American Refugees Nadine Ajaka Welcome to Inishturk where they really dont like Donald Trump.

Because something has gone awry with the spell the epic action fairy tale ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" hoped to cast. With stars Kristen Stewart Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth the movie seemed to have intriguing ingredients. Yet this saga about a young girl who grows into a warrior princess once she escapes the clutches of her malevolent stepmother and gains the fealty of the hunter sent to bring her back falters. ""Snow White"" has flash to be sure. A forest sanctuary inhabited by fairies and bewitched flora and fauna beguiles. Visual flourishes should be expected from a film touting a first-class commercial director. But Rupert Sanders is also a first-time feature director whose talent with images didnt find the necessary complement in the surprisingly leaden script (penned by Evan Daugherty John Lee Hancock and Hossein Amin). On screens big and small the fairy tale has been revised and made over with greater frequency. The most interesting take the spirit of ye olde endeavor and play it forward mining the folkloric power of fairy tales for modern ore ""The Hunger Games"" (with other genres stirred in for good measure) and more clearly ""Hanna"" for instance. Yet as soon as the narrator intones the first lines of the setup the air hissed out of all expectation of something inventive from ""Snow White."" The single exception is a village of women who have figured out a tragic way to protect themselves from Queen Ravennas attempts to suck the beauty and youth out of them and their daughters. Theron portrays Ravenna who ensnares Snow Whites widowed father the King with her radiance becomes queen and dispatches the monarch in a scene straight out of ""Basic Instinct."" True to the lore the jealous knockout consults the mirror one too many times about her status among other women. A gal nags an enchanted looking glass long enough and eventually its going to tell her what she fears hearing. There is someone fairer dear lady. Ravenna has the slightly glassy-eyed stare of someone quietly becoming unhinged. When she finally goes full bore Ravenna brings to mind a role made famous by Faye Dunaway. ""Stepmommie Dearest"" anyone? As the hard-drinking widowed hunter Hemsworth (currently appearing on multiplexes throughout the realm as Thor) has a wry twinkle in his eyes that almost brings some light to this glum tale. Almost. With a bit of special-effects hocus-pocus Ian McShane Toby Jones Eddie Marsan Ray Winstone and funnyman Nick Frost appear as dwarfs. Each suggests the burdens carried by proud men reduced from honorable work to a highwaymans existence. Yet not a one can break the films soporific spell. It would be unfair to saddle Stewart with the failings of a pricey undertaking that doesnt have a bold script. Indeed theres a blankness to Stewarts presence that can serve well films where she portrays young Americans working through their angst. But her transformation from martyr to messiah here is harder to believe than most stories that begin ""once upon a time."" Only Bob Hoskins as the blind seer Muir comes close to making us care. We can almost glean Snow Whites heroic possibilities through his clouded eyes. As much as wed like to we certainly cant from Stewarts efforts.

Director Rupert Sanders turns the Snow White legend into an excuse for lots of muscular action and creepy-crawly histrionics.Charlize Theron is the sinister temptress queen Ravenna whose nemesis Kristen Stewarts Snow White the murdered kings daughter is her chief rival in the fairest-one-of-all smackdown. Chris Hemsworth plays the huntsman who leads Snow White through the Dark Forest to Sanctuary which is full of sprites dwarfs (amusingly played by among others Bob Hoskins Toby Jones and Eddie Marsan) enchanted cobwebs and all sort of other thingies that look as if they were trucked in from a ""Narnia"" movie.Some of the fairy tale effects are marvelous; but the odyssey from darkness to light is unduly long and sloggy and Stewart with her contemporary edge seems to be acting in the wrong era.

( ) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Friday June 1 2012 100 PM Title Snow White and the Huntsman Film Info With Kristen Stewart Charlize Theron. The fairy tale is retold as an action adventure. Director Rupert Sanders (207). PG-13 Violence brief sensuality. Area theaters. Lets be honest we could use some new fairy tales. After all passive princesses hardly reflect the modern mores of 21st century audiences. So ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" a solemn but mostly savvy rewrite is a welcome upgrade. As is so often the case this storys most fascinating character is its villain. After waging war on a wooded kingdom the gorgeous and darkly magical Ravenna (Charlize Theron) marries its ruler only to murder him. His child Snow White (Kristen Stewart) is locked away until the fateful day when Ravennas mirror proclaims Snow the fairest in the land. Her fate seems to be sealed when the youth-obsessed Ravenna learns that she can earn immortality by (literally) stealing her stepdaughters heart. With help from a drunken huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) and a loyal friend (Sam Claflin) Snow escapes into the woods. There she discovers more aid in the form of some surly dwarves (Ian McShane Bob Hoskins Ray Winstone Nick Frost Eddie Marsan Toby Jones Brian Gleeson Johnny Harris). But shell never truly be free until she vanquishes the evil Queen. Despite an overindulgent running time the straightforward script and Rupert Sanders effectively grim direction infuse familiar elements (a white horse a poison apple) with contemporary cleverness. Though the atmosphere feels almost oppressively somber Sanders creative visual eye (his background is in advertising) helps make the most of the archaic settings and showy special effects. Charlize Theron is the evil queen in ""Snow White and the Huntsman."" ( ) As for Snow White shes been beautifully reconceived as both majestic maiden and fierce warrior. But such a strong heroine requires a confident muscular portrayal. And Stewarts characteristic hesitancy -- so fitting for the ""Twilight"" franchise -- undercuts her characters impact. Though designed as a regal Joan of Arc Snow too often comes across as an overwhelmed Bella Swan. Appropriately (or perhaps ironically) enough however the other actors consistently come to her rescue. Hemsworth is especially well cast as the would-be prince a charismatic hero with some intriguingly rough edges. But its Theron who owns this film imbuing her deliciously depraved Queen with furious pain and deep-seated fear. Heres hoping Sanders takes on ""Cinderella"" next -- Id love to see what hed do with those wicked stepsisters. Magic Moment A trip into a supernaturally hallucinogenic dark forest.

Starring Kristen Stewart Charlize Theron Chris Hemsworth Director Rupert Sanders Release Opened Jun 1 2012  Editorial Review Too many bad apples spoil a taleBy Michael OSullivanFriday June 1 2012""Snow White and the Huntsman"" has everything you remember from the classic fairy tale plus a heck of a lot you dont. Overlong overcrowded overstimulating and with an over-the-top performance by Charlize Theron as the evil queen Ravenna the movie is a virtual orchard of toxic excess starting with the unnecessarily sprawling cast of characters. Why is this movie even called ""Snow White and the Huntsman""? As the man sent to capture Snow White (Kristen Stewart) and bring her back so that Ravenna can chow down on the heroines still-beating heart -- ewww by the way -- Chris Hemsworth is no more important to the story than say the queens creepy brother Finn (Sam Spruell). Finn is really the one who ends up hunting Snow White anyway after the nameless huntsman falls victim to his preys beauty and becomes her protector. In that department the huntsmans got competition too. Snow Whites handsome childhood friend William (Sam Claflin) also is out to save her from Finn leading to the obvious question Is Kristen Stewart contractually obligated to have two guys fighting over her in every movie she makes? Even the dwarves here are super-size. Initially there are eight of them not seven. And theyre played by such full-size actors as Ian McShane and Nick Frost who are made to look short through special-effects trickery. Wouldnt it have been simpler not to mention cheaper and less discriminatory to just hire little people? In general the special effects are quite impressive but there are too many of them. Take the queens mirror which morphs into a molten human figure (a la Robert Patricks liquid-metal T-1000 in ""Terminator 2 Judgment Day"") or the queens army whose soldiers turn into shards of black glass. ""Snow White"" is chockablock with visual gimcrackery. A pair of twee CGI fairies an angry troll and a giant white stag with tree branches for antlers -- which appears out of nowhere like Narnias Aslan and then turns into butterflies after getting shot with an arrow -- may be cool to look at but they add nothing to the story. Ah the story. You know it already pretty much. Ravenna is jealous of Snow Whites beauty and wants her dead. Aside from some kinks in the yarn -- Ravennas beauty regimen involves bathing in milk as thick as latex paint and sucking the youth out of young womens mouths like a Dementor from ""Harry Potter"" -- theres little that adds suspense or originality to the tale. And never mind the whole Team Huntsman vs. Team William romantic controversy. Both of Snow Whites suitors are tepid washouts. Its like an episode of ""The Bachelor"" but with a British accent. The pasty delicate-boned William goes around saying things such as ""As you wish mlady"" while our hunky huntsman grunts such anachronisms as ""Okay"" and ""Forget it"" The rest of the dialogue (by Evan Daugherty John Lee Hancock and Hossein Amini) fares little better. At one point Snow White -- outfitted like Joan of Arc and preparing to lead an assault on the queens castle -- actually utters these words apropos of nothing ""Iron will melt but it will writhe inside of itself."" Say what now? Directed by first-timer Rupert Sanders ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" feels less like a movie than a deadly cocktail of movie cliches all of which have been thrown into a blender set to ""slow"" and pureed for two hours. Contains violence and some blood. A review of the film ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" in the June 1 2012 Weekend section incorrectly stated that the story does not include a poison apple. There is one. This version has been corrected.

Movie review Snow White A bold reworking of a classic tale Add to ... Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 01 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 222PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English There is fear and there is enchantment the cornerstones of any classic Grimms fable. There is a compelling and even poignant villain who wraps her sins in a bodice of style. There is a flamboyant director who cant stop showing off and has the talent to back up a goodly share of his boasts. Yes there are many splendid reasons to see Snow White and the Huntsman - enough maybe not to care that neither Snow White nor the Huntsman rank high among them. Video Snow White amp; The Huntsman - Trailer Actors Kristen Stewart left with Charlize Theron right and Chris Hemsworth pose for the media at the World Premiere of the film Snow White and the Huntsman at a cinema in central London Monday May 14 2012. Alastair Grant / AP Movies Video Chris Hemsworth talks about Snow White Charlize Theron and Kristen Stewart bring Snow White to Berlin. Reuters Movies Video Theron Stewart bring Snow White to Berlin After the recent Mirror Mirror which reduced the fable to a gormless accumulation of low camp the title here testifies to a more aggressive take - wiping clean any trace of Disneys ""Heigh-ho"" charm and cranking up the action to attract young males. To that end the main casting is made to measure Just recruit Thor a.k.a. Chris Hemsworth to play the huntsman then entice Kristen Stewart off that Twilight gig to get all snowy and white. The formula seemed banal and the intention suspect. Surprise - its a whole lot better than that.Indeed Britisher Rupert Sanders (another director who came to features via the flashy TV commercial route) opens with a lightning-fast intro that owes more to James Frazers The Golden Bough than anything from the Marvel bible. It starts with the birth of the saviour child destined to ""heal the land"" quickly followed by her mothers death from natural causes and her fathers from a dagger plunged deep to his heart. The blade is wielded on the wedding bed by his new wife the blond and beauteous Ravenna which gives Charlize Theron her first chance to purr with venomous purpose. Her purr is magnificent. ""Men uuuuse women"" she whispers just before putting that knife to its own lethal use. Point taken.Quickly the child grows into Kristen Stewart who finds herself imprisoned in the castle tower - perhaps for her woefully failed attempt to forge a British accent. Of course she escapes prompting Ravenna to convert that whisper into operatic ire all directed at her even blonder brother Finn. Her shout ""Have I not given you everything?"" hints darkly at one thing. The blonde on blondness plus that incest allusion rings a familiar bell and when Ravenna dips her naked body into a bath of milk the bell tolls louder Suddenly intriguingly were in Game of Thrones territory.Admittedly at times the medievalism threatens to tip into outrageous theatricality but Sanders has a happy knack of righting the balance of dipping into his bag of high style to impress us with wonders dark and light. Like the sequence in the dark forest when he disinters a terrible troll from beneath a stone bridge only to have the monster tamed by beautys half-smile. Or like his travelling shot across a mist-filled lake to a village peopled entirely with self-mutilated women their faces bearing the scars of their sacrifice - for them beauty was a burden traded for male-less freedom. Or like the cathedral-light of the dawn in ""fairy land"" when blue-eyed sprites awaken from the belly of a dove and Snow White ruffles the fur of a snow-white stag. Gorgeous.As for the dwarfs theyre portrayed by an impressive crew of veteran and full-sized actors (Bob Hoskins Ian McShane Ray Winstone Toby Jones) miniaturized by cinematic trickery. More important the little ones are deployed less as a comedic troupe than a tragic chorus - when one of them dies their dirge is a touching lament. Also throughout Sanders moves his camera deftly from sweeping panoramas to extreme close-ups including one of our busy heroines dirty fingernails - a Snow White that Caravaggio would have loved.Alas the climactic battle scene the storming of the castle by the forces of good is a signal disappointment. But the figure of evil never is. Even when Ravenna is sustaining her beauty by inhaling the dying breath of virgins - apparently the Botox of the time - Theron somehow manages to humanize her. And when she doesnt Sanders races to the rescue. Watch for a stunning sequence where Ravenna morphs from an alluring woman in a feathered gown into a dark cloud of scattering birds and then back to a woman again but bedraggled now like the Black Swan tarred by an oil slick - her cursed beauty gone and snow white winter nigh.Snow White and the HuntsmanDirected by Rupert SandersWritten by Evan Daugherty John Lee Hancock Hossein AminiStarring Kristen Stewart Charlize Theron Chris HemsworthClassification PG Report Typo/Error Follow us on Twitter GlobeArts Comments AA In the know Life This woman became a middle-age man magnet.

Photo Charlize Therons evil Queen Ravenna is deliciously campy in the flawed but fun epic ""Snow White and the Huntsman."" This years second revisionist take on the Brothers Grimm classic ""Snow White and the Huntsman is a visual treat with some expertly staged (if bloodlessly PG-13) battle scenes. Its a decided improvement on the wretched ""Mirror Mirror but fails to realize the full potential of its ambitiously dark vision. Filtering the timeless fairy tale through the prism of ""The Lord of the Rings ""Star Wars and countless other film fantasies it reinvents Snow (a miscast Kristen Stewart) as a warrior princess who launches a battle to reclaim her kingdom from Queen Ravenna (a campy but effective Charlize Theron). PHOTOS TWILIGHT STARS IN OTHER FILMS Ravenna kills Snows widowed father on their wedding night then imprisons the princess for a decade in a castle tower. The queen sends for her stepdaughter when she learns from the Magic Mirror that consuming her heart will give her immortality but Snow manages to escape. The queens magical powers do not extend to the Dark Forest where Snow has taken flight so she enlists the burly huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) -- whose parents were apparently so poor they couldnt afford to give him a name -- to track her down promising to resurrect his late wife. The closest this version comes to a prince is a hunky cipher of a barons son (Sam Claflin) who completes a half-hearted imitation of the ""Twilight love triangle once Snow and the huntsman vanquish the queens delightfully oily albino-ish brother (Sam Spruell). There are eight not seven dwarves this time around and not the lovable ones from Disney -- theyre drunken thieves closer to the Grimms original vision and most of them could be correctly described as Grouchy. In the biggest misstep the (underused) dwarves are digitally reduced versions of normal-size mostly British character actors who include Ian McShane Bob Hoskins Ray Winstone Nick Frost Toby Jones and Eddie Marsan. Snow Whites eventual triumph may be preordained but acting-wise its really no contest between Stewart and Theron. Nobodys idea of ""the fairest in the land the faintly bruised-looking Stewart brings her familiar disaffected and scowling persona to the character. While Stewart does crack a faint smile on occasion her Snow could use a far more ethereal touch especially when shes interacting with the films special-effects version of nature. She looks great suited up in armor like Joan of Arc though. Greatly abetted by Colleen Atwoods awe-inspiring costumes and by effects that turn her into a flock of ravens and what resembles a pool of tar Theron makes a feast of Ravennas lust for eternal youth. Debuting director Rupert Sanders delivers eye candy by the carload. Its often like watching reels of Ridley Scott Peter Jackson and George Lucas greatest hits and Snows final assault on the queens castle definitely may make this a hit. But to me the nearly two preceding hours often feel like three as the patchwork script keeps introducing characters and subplots and dropping them all while rushing characters through eye-popping environments. This flawed but entertaining epic is called ""Snow White and the Huntsman but Hemsworth -- who swings a double sword with considerably more brio than Thors hammer -- often gets lost in the shuffle until hes needed for the climax.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A princess hunted by an evil queen leads a rebellion to reclaim her throne. BOTTOM LINE A turgid humorless Renaissance Faire with Stewart rehashing her ""Twilight"" role as a princess torn between two lovers. CAST Kristen Stewart Chris Hemsworth Sam Claflin. LENGTH 206 With her passive Bella Swan role in the ""Twilight"" films coming to an end Kristen Stewart hops atop a different horse in ""Snow White amp; the Huntsman."" As Snow Stewart gets to swing a sword but dont be fooled. She spends so much time waffling sullenly between two warrior-suitors that ""Snow White"" feels like little more than ""Twilight"" in chain mail. Those movies have at least given us a few loopy laughs but ""Snow White"" is one grim humorless Renaissance Faire. First-time director Rupert Sanders wallows in violent battles and morbid special effects though whenever he remembers that young girls are watching he fills the screen with pixie dust and friendly forest animals. Is this movie trying to be ""Excalibur"" or ""My Little Pony""? Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? As in ""Mirror Mirror"" another disastrous Snow White adaptation the most compelling character is the evil queen. In that film Julia Roberts imagined her as a kind of spoiled suburbanite while Charlize Theron here plays a tragic figure Ravenna who is literally cursed by beauty. (Both queens undergo extensive spa treatments.) Swooning half-mad and screaming in rage and terror Therons Ravenna dominates the film right up to her last scene. The cast certainly isnt to blame for this botched film. Playing the roughneck dwarves are several fine full-size British actors including Bob Hoskins and Eddie Marsan. Sam Spruell is marvelously malevolent as Ravennas brother Finn. Chris Hemsworth as the beefy huntsman Eric again speaks fake Shakespeare with authority (aside from one stray ""OK"") though Sam Claflin fades into the mists as Snows childhood sweetheart William. Stewart a smart cool presence in films like ""The Runaways"" and ""Adventureland"" deserves better than this. But its going to take more than a sword to stop her from becoming Bella Swan for eternity. PLOT A princess hunted by an evil queen leads a rebellion to reclaim her throne.

CelebritiesKristen Stewart Newsday Tweets from Newsday/newsday-staff Designer costumes for Snow White Charlize Therons evil queen costumes for ""Snow White amp; the Huntsman"" called for hundreds of hand-cut rooster feathers thousands of iridescent beetle wings from Thailand and one particularly imposing crown. The outfits represented a host of firsts for Academy Award-winning costume designer Colleen Atwood. CelebritiesCharlize Theron From the leather piping on the pleats of the queens wedding gown to the gauzy green metal trim on the beetle-wing dress the nine-time Oscar nominee and three-time winner experimented with materials for director Rupert Sanders dark take on the classic fairy tale. advertisement | advertise on newsday ""The idea of the fairy tale sets you free in a way because you can make it up"" Atwood said. ""And I love to make up stuff."" She created an armored ensemble fit for a queen by dressing up chain mail with rolled leather and horsehair trim and topping it off with a particularly pointy metal crown. ""We wanted to have a formidable silhouette"" Atwood said ""and from a distance its spooky with the crown and her height and everything.""

Producer Sure Seems to Tweet So Snow White and the Huntsman New Sneak Peek Kristen Stewart Gets Her Battle On (Video) Charlize Theron camps it up opposite an underplaying Kristen Stewart in a pretty but empty fairy-tale adaptation Its no wonder they keep remaking ""Snow White"" since it seems like a male Hollywood moguls idea of a chick flick Two women battle over whos prettier with the younger hotter model eventually prevailing over the vain old soul-sucking husband-killing witch. Someone should set the story in Beverly Hills to make the message even clearer but ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" takes place in yet another enormous castle perched above yet another enchanted forest. Following the lead of Tim Burtons ""Alice in Wonderland"" ""Huntsman"" takes a traditionally passive lead character and turns her into a sword-wielding warrior woman. And while this newest fairy tale adaptation is a stronger and more coherent movie than ""Alice"" (not much of a feat there) its still something of a beautiful mess with too many characters occasionally sluggish pacing and a tone that veers frenetically between intense and campy. Your evil queen this evening will be Ravenna (Charlize Theron) whose beauty and sorcery have allowed her to survive the ravages of time (and of various kings). Her latest victim is the recently widowed father of the beautiful Snow White and after committing regicide the queen exiles her stepdaughter to the tower. While eating bird hearts and inhaling the life essence of beautiful young women helps a little Ravenna eventually finds it harder and harder to maintain her youth and beauty so when her magic mirror (which looks more like a gong) tells her she can be immortal by possessing the heart of the now-adult Snow White (Kristen Stewart) who is fairer and purer the queen sends for the girl. A bird whose wing Snow White had mended as a child helps the lass escape (this is the sort of thing that works way better in a Disney cartoon than in a live-action movie) so the queen hires the huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) to track the runaway in the dark woods that few people can navigate. Once he realizes the queens treachery the never-named huntsman accepts Snow Whites offer to transport her to a neighboring castle from which she can launch a war that will end Ravennas reign for good. The movie never skimps on visual effects from monsters made of glass shards to a hallucinatory and foreboding dark forest -- although one moment featuring a multi-antlered white stag is such a rip-off of ""Princess Mononoke"" that Studio Ghibli should sue -- but the characterizations are almost never as interesting as Colleen Atwoods costumes. There will be lots of versions of Therons evil queen running around West Hollywood and Chelsea this Halloween; its a performance thats about one part Tilda Swinton to 30 parts Faye Dunaway and its the sort of over-the-top craziness that spawns midnight screenings for drunken audiences. On the other end of the spectrum is Stewart doing the petulant-teen routine that ""Twilight"" viewers have come to know so well over the years with the added twist of becoming a boarding-school Saint Joan in the films final act. Even swaddled in armor and chain mail its hard to imagine this blank-faced debutante stirring an army to follow her to Forever 21 much less to battle against a powerful necromancer. Speaking of ""Twilight"" the movie gives Snow White two potential suitors -- the Huntsman and Snows grown-up childhood beau William (Sam Claflin) -- but its never particularly well delineated how either man is important to the story. Its admirable to have a movie with a strong heroine who isnt defined by her love interest(s) but if the guys are going to be around we should know why as well as how our heroine feels about them. And then there are the dwarves Earlier this year ""Mirror Mirror"" managed to find a septet of compelling and funny actors who happened to be little people. ""Huntsman"" uses CG trickery to render well-known character actors like Bob Hoskins Toby Jones Ian McShane Eddie Marsan Nick Frost and Ray Winstone into the vertically-challenged forest dwellers who come to our heroines aid and while theyre all engaging and amusing I found myself thinking so much about the effects work that I was completely taken out of what little story there was by that point in the film. Therons outrageous turn will no doubt inspire drag queens the world over but beyond that ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is just another fairy tale that loses its way in the woods.

Stunningly shot and inconsistently acted and written Snow White has enough visual fireworks to keep the film afloat even if star Kristen Stewart cant get out of Twilight mode.A modern-day twist on the 200-year-old fairy tale Snow White aims to be The Lord of the Rings meets the Brothers Grimm. And while the battle scenes are fitting of a Tolkien tale the performances prevent the story from having the resonance of either movie or fable.STORY Snow White Charlize Theron vs. Kristen StewartPHOTOS Stars make movie magic with fairy-tale rolesMORE View the latest news reviews amp; coverage of all things film at USA TODAY MoviesDirected by feature-film freshman Rupert Sanders Snow White wastes little time plunging us into the story overlong at more than two hours.We are introduced to the beautiful cunning Ravenna (Charlize Theron) the evil queen who dispatches her husband and overtakes the kingdom within the first 15 minutes of the movie. If only the rest were as briskly paced.About the movieSnow White and the Huntsman1/2 out of fourStars Kristen Stewart Chris Hemsworth Charlize Theron Director Rupert SandersDistributor Universal Pictures Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action and brief sensuality Running time 2 hours 7 minutes Opens Friday nationwideAs in the fairy tale the queen locks her late husbands beautiful daughter Snow White in a tower prison while plunging the realm into chaos. And like the fable the queen grows discontented when a computer-generated mirror tells her she is no longer the fairest of them all.The epiphany triggers the films formidable action which sends Snow White on the run and the studly huntsman Eric (Chris Hemsworth) on her trail. But he soon declines his mission opting to protect the princess -- and face the queens wrath.This should be slam-dunk stuff. The twist is believable and a gateway to jaw-dropping fight scenes. But as soon as the film starts to hum its slowed by psychoanalysis and manic acting.Stewart in particular seems miscast. She is as sullen and morose as she was in the Twilight franchise and we need more verve from a hero meant to embody the modern woman. But the script gives her little to do but sulk. Enjoy seven clips from Snow White and the Huntsman.Theron sits at the opposite end of the emotional spectrum. With a scream that sounds like nails on a chalkboard Therons over-the-top villain plays a little like the Wicked Witch of the West. And its debatable that Stewart bests Theron in the beauty department.The strongest performance belongs to Hemsworth who seems more comfortable than ever as an action star. This follow-up to his roles in Thor and The Avengers allows him to display a little frailty and humor though we could use more of both.The film includes nods to the fairy tale but they dont always work. There are dwarfs (eight instead of seven for some reason) and they have many of the films most humorous scenes. But they are too few and far between.None of this may matter to the Twitter generation for whom this was clearly made. Snow White is gorgeous and the message -- that women dont need to be the damsels in distress -- should appeal to parents not put off by the dark imagery.Still maybe someone should have asked that mirror ""Who are the fairest screenwriters of them all? -- and hunted them down.

"Movie review Forget fair Snow White and the Huntsman is fierce - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Snow WhiteMovie review Forget fair Snow White and the Huntsman is fierceKristen Stewart and Charlize Theron star in director Rupert Sanders revisionist fairy tale. Its a joy to watch but it needs a love story with passion.June 01 2012|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Kristen Stewart of the ""The Twilight Saga"" films plays Snow... (Universal Pictures )""Snow White and the Huntsman""starring a fierce Kristen Stewart and an even fiercer Charlize Theron as warring sides of good and evil is a baroque enchantment filled with dazzling darkness desultory dwarfs demonic trolls and beastly fairies. It is an absolute wonder to watch and creates a warrior princess for the ages. But what this revisionist fairy tale does not give us is a passionate love a its kisses are as chaste as the snow is white.Perhaps they are saving the passion for the sequel for it seems there is surely one to come after director Rupert Sanders brilliantly inventive debut. The films Alexander McQueen-esque illusions of grandeur do a very good job of masking its flaws and for the story Evan Daugherty has conjured up a serious feminist twist on the ages old fable. It is his first screenplay to be produced with later assists and shared credit with veterans John Lee Hancock (""The Blind Side"" ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"") and Hossein Amini (""Drive"" ""The Wings of the Dove"").The bones of the tale remain as the Brothers Grimm envisioned it a a villainess queen obsessed with beauty a truth-telling mirror a fairer and far younger Snow White helpful hapless dwarfs a poison apple and the power of true loves kiss. But its the way in which the filmmakers have fleshed things out that makes the magic happen. The best addition is a drunken mercenary in the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) who is pressed by the Queen to track down Snow White.Instead of a prince there is a childhood sweetheart who grows into the daring duke William (Sam Claflin) a bowman destined to break down walls that both protect and repress. Queen Ravenna is now blessed and cursed with a hopelessly devoted and devious brother Finn (Sam Spruell). And in addition to notions of immortality the pure of heart and the blackest of souls the film is examining all the ways in which power-mad politics can bleed a country and its people dry.But the seismic shifts have come in the heroics with Snow White driven by her destiny to right the wrongs of her kingdom a girl of ambitions who cant be bothered by love. Duke William is something of a romantic player but its the Huntsman who proves most worthy of Snow Whites anger and her affection a shes really not into the whole being saved thing and if theres a white steed shell ride it herself thank you very much.Hemsworth has a great screen presence that works as a good counterpoint to the slightly built Stewart. He is explosive when there are fights to pick but he flounders as a sloppy drunk and hes not given much of a chance to become a heartthrob.In Therons hands Ravenna plays a lethal political and personal game literally and figuratively sucking the life out of everything and everyone around her. It is a chilling transformation for the actress who embodies the Queens desperation for youth and immortality in ways that are frighteningly reflective of our times. Those bloody little raven hearts she seems to be munching would sell like hotcakes if they had half of the rejuvenating properties we witness on screen.But none of it would work without Stewarts steely Snow White as the bough that will not break and never have the actress soulful eyes and exposed heart worked more in her favor. The story begins with her magical childhood (Raffey Cassidy plays the young Snow White) that is soon marred by her mothers death and her fathers (Noah Huntley) fateful fall for the damsel who will cause all the distress and that molten mirror mirror on the wall. Its shape-shifting properties are one of the films many mesmerizing effects (Christopher Obi gives the reflecting glass a booming bass voice to match).What exceeds expectations is the way in which the film realizes Sanders insane flights of fancy from the evil armies that shatter into dark shards to the eerie way in which actors Ian McShane and Bob Hoskins have been morphed into wonderfully wizened dwarfs.This is a movie that is built from the ground up for maximum visual impact a the sewage that Snow White must swim through is wretched the rock-hewn castle seems hand-carved out of the cliffs the mythical white stag in a forest lush with bewitching flora and fauna is otherworldly to behold.And anything that Ravenna touches a from her cloak of black feathers to her milk bath immersion a really look like ideas plucked from a Paris runway or a Vogue fashion spread. Greig Fraser handles the gorgeous cinematography Dominic Watkins the production design Oscar-winner Colleen Atwood the costumes. Cedric Nicolas-Troyan and Philip Brennan supervise visual effects but they are only the tip of the iceberg that created this monument to style.There is substance to be sure in all the righteous battles that are waged the mettle that is tested. But this is ultimately a story whose heroines fate hangs on a kiss. And the power of that kiss to breathe life into anyone or anything is the hardest thing about this fairy tale to believe.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESLiberty Ross on living through Rupert Sanders-Kristen...October 30 2013Emma Roberts arrested Will it affect Were the Millers?July 17 2013Movie Projector Snow White to be fairest of them all at...May 31 2012Snow White and the Huntsman director wanted real feeling...May 20 2012The Director Rupert Sanders bleeds for Snow White and the...April 29 2012MORE STORIES ABOUTSnow WhiteFairy TaleRupert SandersCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-snow-white-20120601,0,3157356.story?track=rss",200,snowwhiteandthehuntsman17,snowwhiteandthehuntsman,latimes

One of them which approaches pure enchantment has been woven from dazzling imagery inspired design and a pair of powerful performances Charlize Theron as Snow Whites persecutor Queen Ravenna and Chris Hemsworth as the put-upon heroines protector the Huntsman of the title. An evil spell nearly does Snow White in but its lifted in the nick of time. The strangest spell afflicts Kristen Stewart; she cant seem to imbue Snow White with anything more than a semblance of feeling. That spell never lifts but it doesnt make much difference in the end because the forces of good manage to work around it. In a twist to the fairy tale the Huntsman ordered to take Snow White into the woods to be killed winds up becoming her protector and mentor in a quest to vanquish the Evil Queen. Video courtesy of Universal. This ambitious production was directed by Rupert Sanders a first-time feature filmmaker who made his reputation with television commercials. Hes a whiz at visual storytelling and he has surrounded himself with such top-notch collaborators as the production designer Dominic Watkins; the cinematographer Greig Fraser and the costume designer Colleen Atwood. (The Gothic look of Ravennas ravishing gowns is sharpened by Art Deco.) They summon up a sumptuously dark and revisionist kingdom thats closer to ""Game of Thrones"" than the Brothers Grimm let alone Walt Disney. Not since ""The Lord of the Rings"" has landscape been so central to mood. For once the effects are special because theyre original the digital dwarfing of seven full-size full-throated performers (more about that later); swarms of crows and their visual echoes shards of black glass into which Ravenna and her cohorts shatter when struck by swords; the queens rising after her shattering from some sort of primordial slime. The main de-Grimming of the plot concerns the Huntsman who in this version is dispatched to capture Snow White but becomes her ardent protector and then her tutor in martial arts. (The script was written by Evan Daugherty John Lee Hancock and Hossein Amini.) To anyone who has seen Mr. Hemsworths recent work in ""The Cabin in the Woods"" and ""The Avengers"" it will come as no surprise that hes a graceful presence as well as a forceful one and as witty as the circumstances allow. (""So youre back from the dead and instigating the masses"" the Huntsman tells Snow White at one point with a lilt in his voice and a twinkle in his eye. She responds with a wan puzzled smile.) The most indelible image of Ravenna is from the back and of her back--curved and ebony white with a spine photographed to seem reptilian. From any angle though Ms. Theron makes the queen a fearsome creature not to mention a man-hater of epic ferocity. ""Immortality"" Ravenna cries lustfully ""immortality forever"" Good for her that she wont settle for the short-term variety; shes as vampiric as any of Ms. Stewarts pals from other precincts. In her time and in her way Ravenna is the ultimate consumer of beauty products sucking the life from those around her to sustain her baleful glow. As movie villains go the queens brother Finn is right down there with the worst of them. Played with stylish malevolence by Sam Spruell he leads a small army that tracks Snow White and the Huntsman through a dead forest (where a terrific chase ends in the ignominy of mud); that lays waste to a peasant village (where consuming fires evoke ""Apocalypse Now"") and follows them to an enchanted sanctuary where the mushrooms have tiny Cyclops eyes and little albino fairies flit about leaving trails of fairy dust. Intense action high-tech aesthetics and exotic settings are Mr. Sanderss strong suits. The director sets a heart-pounding pace pausing only for such interludes as Snow Whites encounter with seven dwarfs who could not be more distant from their Disney forebears. ENLARGE Charlize Theron as Queen Ravenna in Snow White and the Huntsman. Universal Studios The decision to cast the little people as they have been cast was both daring and politically incorrect. Why werent they played by short-statured actors like Peter Dinklage who has finally found the celebrity he deserves on ""Game of Thrones""? Because one suspects the prospect of digitizing Bob Hoskins Ray Winstone Eddie Marsan and other lesser-known but equally formidable Brits was just too delicious to resist. The decision pays off though not as fully as it might have. For all their oddity and for all the sweetness of Snow Whites slow dance with one of their number these dwarfs dont measure up to their potential because the script doesnt bother to differentiate their personalities. Theyre not the only ones who serve more as symbols than individuals; thats how the director steeped in the bold symbolics of TV commercials seems to see the good and evil of Snow Whites world. And thats OK when hes working with Ms. Theron or Mr. Hemsworth; skillful as well as intuitive these stars provide all the nuance a director could ask for. But Snow White is literally another story even though according to Mr. Hoskinss dwarf ""she is life itself."" Ms. Stewarts skills havent caught up with her celebrity so its almost painful to watch and listen as she struggles with an English accent and intones her dialogue lifelessly Not just complex questions like the one Snow White puts to the Huntsman--""Do you drink to drown your sorrows or your conscience?""--but simple lines like her declaration to the dwarfs ""We mean you no harm."" The heroine is more excitable though no more eloquent in her Joan of Arc mode once she has absorbed the Huntsmans lessons of war and leads her followers into the fray. Then the problem becomes displaying her leaps and lunges to best advantage--the actress aspires to more agility than she achieves--while keeping a lid on her shrill outcries. Still whos to say that Ms. Stewart wont give the movie exactly what it needs--legs plus a strong sword arm at the box office? Bella redux she faces the world with adolescent angst and a Twilighted frown and no one is more entitled than Snow White to be angsty. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD Focus ENLARGE Aeon Flux (2005) By now everyone knows that Charlize Theron is a fine actress and that shes done a number of excellent movies. This one does not aspire to excellence or anything close to that heady neighborhood. Its a sci-fi thriller based on the animated MTV show and pretty dreadful if truth be told. But ""Aeon Flux"" is Ms. Therons ""Barbarella"" the sci-fi oddity that earned Jane Fonda perverse renown so its worth a mirthful watch or at least a streaming-service glance. Karyn Kusama directed a cast that includes Jonny Lee Miller Frances McDormand and the late Pete Postlethwaite. Thor (2011) Another film that not only doesnt aspire to excellence but dodges it at every turn. Chris Hemsworth stars as the young God of Thunder who struggles against evil forces and his own impetuousness. The movie struggles against all-encompassing ponderousness and loses. Yet Mr. Hemsworth is a commanding physical presence and a likable one whenever hes given a chance. In certain scenes he seems to be reaching for the state of comedic grace that Amy Adams attained in ""Enchanted."" Thors love interest on Earth is Natalie Portmans astrophysicist Jane who talks earnestly about resolving her particle data. Into the Wild (2007) Kristen Stewart is Tracy Tatro in Sean Penns fascinating screen version of the Jon Krakauer book of the same name. Its a very small role but she gets to sing in a trailer park and gives an agreeably vital performance that could still be predictive of things to come in her career. Emile Hirsch stars as Chris McCandless a kid from a prosperous family who wants to live the life of an aesthetic voyager but blunders into it with unexamined survival skills. The cast includes Marcia Gay Harden William Hurt Catherine Keener Vince Vaughn and Hal Holbrook. --Joe Morgenstern Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump New Sandy Hook Elementary School to Open Soon Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Donald Trump Lashes Out at Michael Bloomberg Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Universal Pictures Snow White and the Huntsman Director Rupert Sanders Genres Drama Fantasy Running Time 127 minutes Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action and brief sensuality With Charlize Theron Kristen Stewart Chris Hemsworth Watch Clips From Snow White and the Huntsman - Huntsman Huntsman Credit Universal Pictures From Snow White and the Huntsman - Troll Troll Credit Universal Pictures From Snow White and the Huntsman - Enchanted Forest Enchanted Forest Credit Universal Pictures What Charlize Theron does for Snow White and The Huntsman in her role as the Wicked Queen is a bit like what Godzilla does for a Godzilla movie She gives you something big and distracting to look at while a lot of thinly defined victims run around frantically trying to avoid a grisly death at her hand. This is the second Snow White movie in only two months and where Marchs Mirror Mirror was whimsical and playful like a cartoon fairy tale this one is meant to be dark and scary like a real fairy tale. This is meant to be the Snow White with the scheming and the murdering of family members and the ripping out of hearts not the Snow White with the ""Hi-ho hi-ho"" theme song. Theyve cast it with actors both well-regarded and popular Aside from Theron as the Wicked Queen Snow White herself is played by Kristen Stewart an actress with considerable chops shes rarely had good opportunities to demonstrate since shes spent so much of her career in the Twilight franchise. And the titular huntsman the queen sends to retrieve Snow White after she escapes from her tower is played by Chris Hemsworth currently hammering things mightily as Thor in The Avengers. The two are destined to get beyond the hunter and the hunted though Once they iron out their differences they become allies in opposing the queens attempts to eat Snow Whites heart and become immortal. (You can see why S.W. in particular would be against this.) The first few minutes of the film from first-time director Rupert Sanders contain some lovely visuals with intriguing uses of specific focus and a white-and-gray palette that promises something foreboding something particularly spare and cold. But quickly that gives way to conventional melodramatic fantasy as we watch the queen yell menace glower and eat the hearts out of birds. Shes accompanied by her sycophantic brother and right-hand man Finn (Sam Spruell) who were the queen a Disney villainess would be a right-hand parrot or lizard. He has it must be said about as many dimensions here as he would there. Once the queens wickedness is made manifest however and just when Therons lusty devouring of a castles worth of scenery begins to shift from impressive to tiresome something even worse happens She disappears from the movie. We then enter a long fallow period in which we wander around with Snow White her huntsman and eventually the seven dwarfs who are not played by actual little people but by digitally altered actors including Ian McShane. Theyre followed around by the pasty and terrible Finn as well as by Snows well-meaning personality-free childhood friend William (Sam Claflin) who serves no conceivable purpose in the story. i Having fled the tower Kristen Stewarts Snow White teams up with the queens huntsman and organizes a resistance. Universal Pictures hide caption toggle caption Universal Pictures Having fled the tower Kristen Stewarts Snow White teams up with the queens huntsman and organizes a resistance. Universal Pictures There was great excitement when the early images from this film emerged because it seemed that here was an active Snow White -- a warrior wearing armor participating in battle rather than watching from a tower and awaiting rescue. Unfortunately thats the tail end of the story and it comes after she like so many fairy princesses before her spends far too much of the proceedings doing almost nothing except being scared and pleading for help. (And in one cringe-inducing sequence pacifying a violent monster by gazing warmly upon it. Even monsters get crushes on her) She does have the resourcefulness to escape in the first place its true but even that escape requires a horse ex machina to appear and after that Snow retreats into passivity and stays there until its time for the final act. What dooms Snow White and the Huntsman is ultimately not how over the top it is but how dull it is. Stewart and Hemsworth have so little chemistry that any romantic undertones between them seem clumsily stapled to the story. (The films PG-13 rating mentions ""brief sensuality"" so there must be some; when it occurs does not come immediately to mind which is ominous in sensuality terms.) Moreover once youve seen the queen bellow and roar youve seen just about everything she does throughout aside from CGI aging effects. Theron can be an actress of sublime subtlety but this role shows off only her power and volume. The idea of a dark Snow White is a sound one and the idea of casting an actress with the strength of Theron to terrorize her is a sound one as well. But everyone involved needed a substantially better script -- and a better eye for the difference between what would come off as loopy creepy darkness and what would just make audiences sit in the theater thinking ""Did that guy just fight a bunch of birds with an ax? Im almost sure he did.""

Matt Gillmer Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Look at yourself in a mirror all your life and youll see death doing its work. In ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" Charlize Therons Queen Ravenna studies her reflection with as much dread as vanity observing decay at work like termites under glass. Her power comes from her otherworldly beauty which can only be maintained by a diet of blood. Human preferably though she will snack on a birds entrails with her clawlike steel fingernail accessories. She is the raging tyrant of her domain having married and killed the king and imprisoned her young stepdaughter. Yet the queen is enslaved by her obsession with the fragility of the flesh. Encountering such a deeply imagined character in a summer extravaganza is a wonderful shock and there are many in this mesmerizing take on the Grimm fable. The film has the DNA of a blockbuster and the soul of a haunting folk tale. It is as dangerous dark intelligent and beautiful as its wraithlike villainess. Kristen Stewart plays the imprisoned princess who was ""adored throughout the kingdom as much for her defiant spirit as for her beauty"" a voice-over tells us. The role fits Stewarts usual moody sullenness -- who wouldnt be rebellious after spending a miserable decade under lock and key? She stretches a bit too hitting notes of tenderness and innocence. Her pure heart makes her the queens nemesis and salvation. The mirror informs Ravenna that eating Snow Whites living heart will grant her immortality. When the girl escapes from her tower cell into the forbidding forests beyond her kindness wins over the drunken brawling Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) sent to recapture her. Hemsworth affecting a Gerard Butler Scots growl plays the part like one of Kurosawas dirty low-born but honorable samurai. He gives the princess pointers on combat. She inspires him to move beyond his grief for his dead wife. The feeling between them grows until it becomes capable of miracles. This is a movie with many things on its mind. It is a ripping swashbuckler in the vein of ""Lord of the Rings."" Its a feminist essay on outer and inner beauty female heroes and fiends. Its a mesmerizing gothic horror film with counterpoints of enchantment and surreal beauty. Its a Christian allegory purer and simpler than the Narnia movies. While it sounds like a recipe for overkill Rupert Sanders confident serious-minded direction and the script -- by first-timer Evan Daugherty John Lee Hancock (""The Blind Side"") and Hossein Amini (""Drive"") -- yields a dramatically engaging fantasy. Sanders crams his frame with nightmare details and scorched barren vistas that owe something to Pieter Bruegels panoramic medieval paintings. Later when the mood lightens theres an interlude in a rather psychedelic grove bustling with plants animals and sprites reminiscent of ""Pans Labyrinth."" There are large-scale astonishments here monsters made of black volcanic glass and a bridge troll with the hide and temper of a rhinoceros. Theron who resembles a dominatrix in her slinky black gowns and severe makeup explodes into a murder of crows when enraged. The greatest of all the boldly stylized tricks is the conception of the dwarves who help Snow White wage a brimstone-and-thunder battle to reclaim her throne. A half-dozen of Englands best character actors -- Ian McShane Bob Hoskins Nick Frost and Ray Winstone among them -- have had their heads digitally grafted onto the bodies of little people. The effect is flawless. Unviersal Studios AP Charlize Theron in a scene from ""Snow White and the Huntsman"". The performances are impressive for a summer special-effects adventure. Hemsworth creates a tough but tender period hero completely distinct from his Thor. Theron fearlessly climbs the summit of high melodrama without toppling over into camp. As detestable as she is shes so fully formidably alive that we cant help but feel drawn toward her magnetic energy. Kristen Stewart skeptics may not be converted by her work but shes used appropriately sparingly acting more through expression than dialogue. In a nice touch her big third-act rally-the-troops speech starts out in a scarcely audible mumble. The princess has never been in public before let alone delivered a speech. Naturally shed need a moment to find her voice. The film finds its commanding tone from the opening shot. I was struck by how completely it transported me into its strange perilous world. Like any successful fantasy it seems less a fiction than a window into a dreamlike alternate reality.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> You dont need a voice in a mirror to tell you which recent Snow White movie is the fairest of them all. Snow White and the Huntsman has Mirror Mirror beat by a mile. Director Rupert Sanders made his bones in commercials and Xbox games and his debut feature is a visual marvel. Not in the way of the chirpy witless postcard-ready Mirror Mirror in which Lily Collins played an unthreatening Snow and Julia Roberts merely swanned around as the Evil Queen. Sanders take on the classic fairy tale is as grim as well the Brothers Grimm originally intended. It has a darkness that seeps into the soul. More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> OK now that Ive scared away the children we can talk. Credit Sanders for assembling an intriguing cast. Kristen Stewart freed from the bonds of Twilight morphs convincingly from a skittish girl into a determined warrior princess. Her Snow White knows that Evil Queen Ravenna (Charlize Theron) her stepmother murdered her father on their marriage bed and now wants Snow dead so she can eat her heart out. Literally. Otherwise theres no way the Queen can stay the fairest in the land since Snow is looking good. The Queen dispatches the Huntsman (Thors Chris Hemsworth) to the Dark Forest to find Snow and perform his own brand of thoracic surgery. But the Huntsman a drunken widower begins to see Snows point. Then theres the matter of the seven dwarfs (eight in this version). A bunch of scruffier forest shits you couldnt find anywhere. And theyre far from little darlings as played by the formidable likes of Ian McShane Ray Winstone Eddie Marsan Toby Jones Nick Frost and Bob Hoskins all shrunk down to dwarf size. ""Let her rot"" they shriek in a manner that hardly befits a toydoll collection. This is all to the good. What rankles is that Sanders loses his nerve just when the story starts cooking. Stewart looks strong on horseback in armor and its satisfying that Snow and the Huntsman never even think of getting it on. This sister is definitely doing it for herself. But Sanders leads her on a conventional route to the films climax. Also as a director of actors Sanders has no flair for modulation. Theron is every inch the imperious Queen and the way her silence simmers is something to behold. But when the Queen starts ranting like a Real Housewife of Castle Bitch Therons power dwindles. Snow White and the Huntsman is definitely a missed opportunity. Sanders was on to something in taking the Snow White tale to its most menacing extreme. Right now he lacks the skill set to shape and mold whats in his head to screen proportions. But the good news is that Sanders has the potential to do just that. Todays misfire just might turn into tomorrows masterwork.

Check. Evil queen? Check. And the warrior waif in armor leading a charge of rebels on horseback storming the castle gates as burning oil and fireballs rain down . . . um thats Snow White? Yes it is. A full-force fairy tale that takes the Grimms twisty yarn and adds heapings of The Lord of the Rings The Chronicles of Narnia Joan of Arc and Celtic myth Snow White and the Huntsman - with Kristen Stewart and Chris Hemsworth in the title roles - is not your grandmothers Disney cartoon. The seven dwarfs when they finally make their appearance deep in a spellbound forest arent whistling while they work Theyre a bunch of knobby thugs and theyre played by a gang of great British character actors (Hoskins Jones McShane Winstone) digitally diminuated and ready to steal anything they can get their hands on - including the movie. And a surprisingly fine fantastic movie it is. Directed by Rupert Sanders a Brit with a resume of eye-popping commercials (Halo Xbox Puma Adidas) Snow White and the Huntsman finds its hero like Frodo or Odysseus before her engaged in an epic quest. From innocent beautiful child (played in the prologue by Raffey Cassidy) to a wan prisoner in a dank tower to a fugitive in hiding to an exiled royal ready to reclaim her throne and restore the land to rosier days Snow White - with her pale skin and raven tresses and Errol Flynn-as-Robin Hood tights - is the archetypal adventurer facing daunting challenges and meeting them head-on. Stewart who was beginning to seem hobbled by the torn-between-two-lovers teenage angst of The Twilight Saga literally jumps into her role here (she escapes the queens clutches by propelling down a watery chute). Theres a scene with Snow White moving warily through the woods in which she faces off with a tree troll. Even Hemsworths Huntsman a sad angry soul hired by the queen to return the runaway princess to the castle is impressed. He should be. As for the queen Ravenna Charlize Theron has a grand old time sexy sinister soliloquizing before a giant gong-shaped mirror plotting with her lecherous brother (Sam Spruell) dressed in elegant capes cloaks and gowns. Her slip-on talons used to pluck the hearts out of little birds are quite practical too. If Theron has to deliver a few laughably bad lines (Ravenna wants ""immortality forever"" - as opposed to the short-term immortality option?) she does so with aplomb. Stewart likewise rallies her troops with an invitation to mount up and ""ride like the thundering waves"" Not exactly the St. Crispins Day speech. Like the original Grimm tale Sanders and companys Snow White and the Huntsman digs into Jungian and Freudian muck The apple is temptation but also knowledge; the relationship between sister and brother is founded on trust but also perhaps on desire (Snow Whites long-lost sibling William returns in the guise of English pretty boy Sam Claflin). And Christian and pagan themes run through the story Snow White is greeted by a statuesque hart (with tree branches for antlers) a god figure with hooves. Their fateful meeting happens in the midst of an enchanted forest where the mushrooms have eyeballs and weird little naked faeries pop from the breasts of magpies. Its like a pre-Raphaelite acid trip. Freaky and twee. In a good way of course. Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Unless were talking inner beauty--which is exactly what this movie is about. By Mary Pols MaryPolsMay 31 2012 Share Read Later Universal Pictures Snow White and the Huntsman Year 2012 Director Rupert Sanders Studio Universal Pictures Actors Kristen Stewart Chris Hemsworth Charlize Theron Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture The underlying message of Snow White and the Huntsman the darkly re-imagined thrilling new spin on the classic fairy tale is that focus on and insecurity over ones physical appeal to men is poison to a womans soul. Thats hardly a news flash--feminists and good mothers have been preaching this for ages but movies with their emphasis on genetic lottery winners tend to steadily undermine the message even when supposedly celebrating it. Whens the last time you thought the wicked stepmother or evil queen could defeat the heroine within the shallow auspices of a beauty contest? This Snow White albeit 10 minutes too long and loaded with the standard action sequences of 21st century summer feels excitingly progressive because it actually represents the victory of inner beauty. Not to cast aspersions on the loveliness of Kristen Stewart but I believe--or hope--thats the result of an intentionally bold move by first-time director Rupert Sanders in terms of casting his two female leads. The impossibly beautiful--and youthful--Charlize Theron plays the wicked stepmother and sorceress Queen Ravenna who appears first in the guise of a victim supposed chattel of a rogue (magical) army invading the kingdom of Snow Whites widowed father King Magnus (Noah Huntley). She quickly suckers him into marrying her. Beauty is her power and her curse--she seethes with resentment for the male response to her glory and offs the poor fool before consummation. Little Snow is tossed into a tower prison. About 10 years later when Snow White--played by Kristen Stewart hair dyed black lips stained red skin as pale as a Cullens--comes of age Ravennas magic mirror dares to tell her Snow White is the fairest of them all. Ravenna will have to kill Snow and consume her heart in order to reclaim her title. (READ TIME talks to the Huntsman--Chris Hemsworth) Mirror mirror who is your manufacturer and where might they process returns? Theron glows even when Ravennas magical powers are waning and shes allegedly looking haggard. Dressed by costume designer Coleen Atwood in fantastically over-the-top numbers worthy of the best days of Alexander McQueen Theron is a goddess a breathtaking piece of human perfection. You can see why a judgmental mirror would tell Mirror Mirrors wicked stepmother Julia Roberts that lovely young Lily Collins as rose-like and Disney-beautiful as they come had the edge. But the mirror in Snow White and the Huntsman is addressing something deeper than pillowy lips and even features. What makes Stewarts Snow White fairer is what is inside her humanity empathy and character. Snows mother wished for a child (seen in prologue) to mimic a rose she found blooming in winter--its beauty but more than anything its strength a description never mentioned in Grimm. Which is the essence of Snow White and the Huntsmans Snow who leaps into raw sewage then a churning sea and plunges into an enchanted forest to escape and rally her people with the passionate cry ""Who will be my brother?"" The men Snow encounters with the exception of Ravennas freakily coiffed brother (Sam Spruell) who has a pervy interest in her and the worlds worst Louise Brooks hairdo arent immediately dazzled by the girl. The Huntsman (Thors Chris Hemsworth) a hunk nursing the heartbreak of his wifes death agrees to help her but is largely unimpressed. He slices off the bottom of Snows dress fashioning her a more travel-worthy tunic and when she looks taken aback sneers ""Dont flatter yourself."" Its only when he sees the curious connection she has with a troll that the Huntsman starts to regard her as anything but a hapless girl. In another nod to a more modern heroine their attraction builds slowly (especially considering Hemsworth could have chemistry with a potted plant). (MORE TIMEs take on Why Pop Culture Loves Fairy Tales Again) It even takes a while for the dwarves (eight to start mostly played by famous English actors like Ian McShane Ray Winstone Bob Hoskins Toby Jones and Eddie Marsan and shrunk to size by cinematic magic) to warm to her. They recognize her as ""the one"" the designated savior of the land only after seeing the woodland creatures respond to her. This sequence the only one to truly pay homage to Walt Disney is glorious--a live action version of a psychedelic paradise complete with winking mushrooms friendly fairies and butterflies as thick as snow and pale as the moon. With Snow played by this girl with the pointy chin its the inner glow that counts as it should be. Twilight fans will likely vigorously disagree with this entire assessment and tell you that Kristen Stewart is the prettiest girl and the greatest actress in the world. At the risk of inflaming them the truth is that her intimate Twilight-mined knowledge of being the tentative uncomfortable object of obsession dovetails nicely with what the trio of writers (Evan Daugherty John Lee Hancock and Hossein Amini) apparently had in mind for this Snow White. This is no award-winning revelatory peformance but Stewart holds her own. I had thought the movie would be entirely Therons. Certainly shes a wicked pleasure even when hitting notes of hysteria that teeter on the absurd. Melodrama is Ravennas default mode and Snow White and the Huntsman gives her the back story to explain it. In the old days no one fretted about the motivation of the likes of a wicked stepmother but Ravenna is a victim (of rape and pillage if Im not mistaking the intent of a hazy flashback). Shes also a founding member of a Second Wives Club embittered by having served as a replacement wife for a king who had grown tired of his aging first wife. Her quest for eternal youth was a response to the expectation that she too would be replaced someday by someone younger and prettier. For Ravenna beauty translates to power. (If thats not an allegory for the Hollywood star system I dont know what is. And in one of the movies many luscious special effects the magic mirror assumes a masculine form that looks like a half-melted Oscar. Coincidence?) If there is no beautiful young woman available to suck the soul from she digs the most awesome set of press-on nails ever into the still-beating heart of little birds and pops them in her mouth a bloody amuse bouche. Closely analyzed all this effort to stay pretty seems a backwards approach to rebelling against the opposite sex--why not welcome grey hairs and run for medieval congress? But as a Gothic nightmarish Grimm not for children or preteens Snow White and the Huntsman succeeds. Sanders who has worked primarily in commercials seems heavily influenced by Peter Jackson and his action sequences ripe with clanging armor and horse hooves tearing into earth reflect a little of the majesty of Lord of the Rings. Hes less subtle though--in case you missed Snows dirty of-the-people fingernails the first time he shows them a couple more times--and his climatic moments of combat tend to involve senselessly whirling cameras. But he has a talent for propulsion and unpredictability even with this well-known fairy tale. There are moments when youre lost in the beauty of the scenery and/or the cast--oh that Welsh coast those English moors that Hemsworth swagger--and then suddenly theres some shock that resets perceptions. Rare among the recent fairy tale adaptions (from Mirror Mirror to the dreadful Red Riding Hood) the invigorating Snow White and the Huntsman actually breathes new life into an old story.

"Snow White and the Huntsmen starring Kristen Stewart and Charlize Theron reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Sorry But Kristen Stewart Has No Business Playing Snow White Sorry But Kristen Stewart Has No Business Playing Snow White Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 31 2012 119 PM Snow White and the Huntsman Fourteen percent more dwarfs 100 percent less charm than the fairy tale. By Dana Stevens The Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) and Snow White (Kristen Stewart) in Snow White and the Huntsman Photograph by Alex Bailey. The recent mini-boom in movies and TV shows based on fairy tales--in the past year there have been two network series Once Upon a Time and Grimm and two movies Mirror Mirror and now Snow White and the Huntsman (Universal Pictures)--may not have produced any masterpieces but the idea of mining centuries-old folklore for Hollywood source material has potential. Fairy tales--the real grotty passed-down-through-centuries-of-oral-literature kind--offer simple emotionally resonant stories with proven crowd appeal not to mention an excuse for all kinds of lavish visual spectacle (giants trolls epic battles royal pageantry). Snow White and the Huntsman the first feature from British commercial director Rupert Sanders has its work cut out for it if it wants to be a truly dull piece of junk--but it manages. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Its tempting to blame the movies peculiar leadenness on its casting. Charlize Theron isnt a terrible choice to play the evil queen though the poignancy of the queens obsession with youth might register more deeply if she were played by an actress who showed any visible signs of aging. But Twilights Kristen Stewart as Snow White--especially this particular version of Snow White a Joan of Arc-like medieval action heroine? Not gonna happen. I wont argue as some have that Stewart isnt beautiful enough to be plausible as the winner of the ""Whos the fairest of them all?"" face-off--theyre both lovely so maybe the magic mirror just prefers slight brunettes to statuesque blondes. But Stewarts whole manner her slouchy bearing and general aura of sulky passivity make her ill-suited to play a deposed princess whose irresistible charisma enables her to lead a peasant revolt. Stewart may have a limited range but I dont mind her in contemporary roles--shes just right as the moony Bella in the Twilight movies or Jesse Eisenbergs object of desire in Adventureland and she even made a passable Joan Jett. Still the image of her leading a castle siege in full battle armor is so incongruous it might come from one of those parody trailers that opened Ben Stillers Tropic Thunder. But Snow White and the Huntsmans problems go deeper than just the casting. This over-crammed disjointed and lugubrious film is misconceived from the ground up. Producer Joe Roth also worked on Tim Burtons Alice in Wonderland and the two films share a depressingly similar kind of badness with howd-they-do-that? CGI effects and ravishing production design piling up uselessly atop an increasingly incoherent story. Advertisement From a technical standpoint the most notable of these effects has to be the convincing digital miniaturization of eight average-sized actors into 4-foot-tall versions of themselves (yes spoiler alert this Snow White adaptation features eight dwarfs. Not that I am suggesting that any dwarf is ...  expendable). I spent a solid minute thinking ""Wow they sure found a little-person actor who looks and sounds like Ian McShane"" before realizing it was McShane. Along with Bob Hoskins Toby Jones Ray Winstone Eddie Marsan Nick Frost--a dream team of British character actors who are given little more to do than drink out of wineskins and jig around campfires. (There are fleeting hints that these dwarfs are hard-partying and a little pervy but sadly we never get to see them in full Game of Thrones debauchery mode.) The digitized dwarfs dont show up until well into the movie just as Snow White and the brawny Scottish huntsman the queen has hired to track her down (Chris Hemsworth who plays Thor in The Avengers) are emerging from the Dark Forest a bad-trip zone full of malevolent ankle-grasping trees swarming insects and stone bridges that transform into fanged trolls. Many of these transformation effects are cool-looking from a design point of view; in particular Sanders seems obsessed with images of shape-shifting viscous liquids like the magic mirror which when asked a question melts into a pool of metal and then rises to form the shape of a veiled figure. Later the queen will similarly materialize from a puddle of oozy black goo like the Wicked Witch melting in reverse. In a welcome respite from the pervading atmosphere of stylish music video-style gloom theres also a kitschy enchanted forest straight out of Teletubbies with friendly woodland creatures creepy-cute one-eyeballed mushrooms and tiny green fairies (naked but disturbingly genital-less presumably with an eye to the PG-13 rating). I found myself looking forward to these little flights of visual fancy because Snow White and the Huntsman doesnt otherwise bring much imagination to its retelling of the venerable European folktale. Some of the key turning points in the myth--for example the scene in which Snow White is brought back to life by a true loves kiss--are puzzlingly botched. Because of the films herky-jerky pacing and perhaps a deleted scene or two the princesss apparent death seems to last no more than a few hours--there isnt even time to build a glass coffin before shes on her feet delivering a St. Crispins Day-style pep talk to the oppressed villagers. The key relationship in the Snow White story of course is the twisted maternal dynamic between the aging queen and her just-blossoming-into-adulthood stepdaughter who must be imprisoned killed even (in this version) physically consumed to keep her from surpassing the queen in beauty. And its with respect to this relationship that Snow White and the Huntsman most markedly drops the ball. Therons character the vain despotic Queen Ravenna is given a hideous toadying brother (Sam Spruell) as a henchman and foil but he heads off into the Dark Forest early on in search of the runaway princess leaving Theron to play most of her scenes in essence alone with only interchangeable faceless advisers to listen to her villainous rants. Theron and Stewart get only two scenes together one of them devoted almost entirely to action. Yes its possible that their contrasting performance styles--Stewart mumbling and skulking in her armor Theron chomping scenery as a camp diva in raven feathers--might have made any further encounters between the two unintentionally comic. But keeping these powerful female characters separated for so much of the film squanders the dramatic potential inherent in the ancient fairy tale which is at heart about the tricky handoff of sexual power from one generation to another and what happens when one side is unwilling to let go.

By CHRIS VOGNAR cvognardallasnews.com Movie Critic Published 30 May 2012 0736 PM Updated 30 May 2012 0736 PM Related Growing up with fairy tales inspires Dallas Evan Daughertys Snow White Follow Chris Vognar on Twitter By some odd quirk of scheduling we have now arrived upon the second misguided Snow White adaptation of the year. Mirror Mirror was the mirthless pop-art comedy version featuring Julia Roberts as the vainglorious evil queen. Now comes Snow White and the Huntsman a sludgy gothic action movie that cant make the most of an underused Charlize Theron.The two movies have little in common but they both lack the same essential ingredients a center that defines the story and characters and an indication that the rules arent being made up from scene to scene. The black magic wielded by Therons Queen Ravenna is wildly erratic; this is one of those movies that makes you ask ""If you can do that why didnt you do it from the get-go?"" Answer because that would make for a mighty short film. If only.Things actually start with some faux-Shakespearean feminist flair. Mourning his late wife a king falls for a blond beauty only to have her stab him in the heart (literally). Therons Ravenna has plenty of vanity but she also thirsts for immortality and savors her sovereign authority. ""Men use women"" she purrs before disposing of her husband. Not this woman. Ravenna burdened by the quest for eternal life and beauty is just compelling and underwritten enough to make us want more.Theron sinks her teeth into the role and controls the screen. Her long absences create a vacuum when she cedes the action to Kristen Stewart as a destinys child Snow White and Chris Hemsworth as the hard-drinking huntsman. (That role as played by the reliably bumbling Nathan Lane was the only saving grace of Mirror Mirror.)Stewarts Snow White is the Chosen One as illustrated by her acumen with trolls in the dark forest (here be computer-generated creepy-crawlies) fairies in the sanctuary (they emerge magically from the breasts of chirping birds) and the quite explicit reminder that ""she is the one."" Maybe shell team up with Keanu Reeves for the next Matrix movie.And now a word about the dwarfs. Theyre a hard bunch cut from the Grimms cloth not prone to being dopey sneezy or sleepy. And theyre not played by dwarfs a fact that cant make dwarf thespians and their representatives very happy. I suppose if the wizards of Hollywood can make vertically challenged movie stars look tall they can also make the likes of Ian McShane Ray Winstone Bob Hoskins and Toby Jones appear smaller than they really are.Snow White and the Huntsman has enough visual flourish to provide periodic distraction from its narrative and thematic muddle. But too much of it feels like a meandering rumble through darkness and light. If Mirror Mirror was a self-congratulatory lark Huntsman is an exercise in empty dread.The only one who comes out of this odd pairing unscathed is Walt Disney looking smarter than ever for boiling the tale down to its mythical essence way back in 1937. As a wise man once said if it aint broke dont fix it.SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN(C) Directed by Rupert Sanders. PG-13 (violence brief sensuality). 127 mins.

Handsome but hollow ""Snow White amp; the Huntsman"" is easily among the stranger additions to a roster of rebooted fairy tales that has already seen two versions of this one ""Mirror Mirror"" and the ABC series ""Once Upon a Time"" awaken in the last nine months. Owing more to ""The Lord of the Rings"" than anything else but borrowing freely from a half-dozen sources Universal faces the formidable challenge of marketing a gritty muscular and (except for the CGI) old-fashioned guy-oriented action yarn thats based on a property closely associated with children and young girls fondness for princesses. Thats not to say the result doesnt have some satisfying moments but Universal might have to settle for the somewhat faint praise that its latest summer entry is at least more seaworthy than ""Battleship."" And while ""Snow White"" promoters trumpeted the producers ties to ""Alice in Wonderland"" Tim Burtons madcap reimagining is nowhere to be found here. Instead working from a script credited to Evan Daugherty John Lee Hancock and Hossein Amini commercial director Rupert Sanders maiden film opens with a fairly lengthy and dark prologue explaining how the evil Queen Ravenna (Charlize Theron) as much succubus as sorceress used her feminine wiles and magic to seize the kingdom kill the king and imprison his beautiful young daughter. Years pass and Snow White (now Kristen Stewart) has grown to adulthood in captivity but seizes an opportunity to escape Shawshank-style into the Dark Forest. Since the Queens magic wont work there she enlists a simple Huntsman (""Thors"" Chris Hemsworth) whos become a bit of a drunkard since losing his wife to go and fetch the wayward girl. After that the movie gives way to a series of episodic battles and escapes the best of which visually includes a too-brief encounter with a massive troll. Grudgingly the Huntsman assumes the responsibility of protecting Snow White who wants to reunite with those loyal to her father a band that includes a noble boy William (Sam Claflin) with whom she cavorted as a youth. Handy with a bow William is a sterling hero in his own right once again giving a Stewart character the privilege of being surrounded by two hunky potential suitors. Its a dynamic that hardly smacks of chance any more than the sweeping vistas virtually plucked from the ""Rings"" trilogy; the magic mirror that morphs into an oozing mass seemingly culled from ""Terminator 2;"" or portentous dialogue in which it is pronounced ""She is the one"" in reverent ""Matrix""-like tones regarding Snows ability to end the Queens evil reign. Precious little here really pops unfortunately including an only slightly familiar septet of dwarves -- played by the likes of Bob Hoskins Ian McShane and Ray Winstone with an assist from the visual-effects maestros -- who prove extremely handy in a scrape but dont provide as much comic relief as might have been intended. The cast does what it can -- especially Theron whose frequent fits add ""drama"" and ""raging"" to her regal title -- but cant overcome a degree of flatness to the middle section or lack of consistent excitement at the end. Nor does Hemsworths roguish charm come across as effortlessly as it did in ""Thor."" In years past all this might have made for a perfectly acceptable Saturday matinee -- something like ""The Magic Sword"" comes to mind -- but the current requirements of theatrical tentpoles dont allow for such modestly scaled ambitions. By that measure the movie and its villain share a common bond Conjuring a touch of magic is one thing but sustaining great helpings of it is something else entirely.

But they should.The story elements going back to the early 19th century Brothers Grimm version remain present with tweaks. Snow White the daughter of the king endures the death of her mother and acquires a stepmom (stepqueen?) in suspiciously short order. The interloper with the aging issues here carries the name Ravenna and her magic mirror comes with advanced digital properties and shape-shifting ""Terminator 2"" quicksilver technology unavailable to the Grimm boys. For years Ravenna locks Snow White up in an unattractive wing of the seaside castle and the kingdom goes to pot while the evil queen and her sniveling brother swan and skulk from morn to night. After a daring escape Snow White is pursued by the huntsman of the title under Ravennas ""or else"" decree.There are dwarfs to be met Shakespearean echoes aplenty (Bob Hoskins plays the wise old blind dwarf a variation on ""King Lears"" Gloucester) an enchanted forest with sprites and a white stag. There is a kingdom to take back and a question to be answered above all others Can Kristen Stewart act? Yes she can. No her range isnt infinite. Certain behavioral and technical fallbacks -- the quick-exhale-then-grin for example -- persist in fantasy roles as well as realistic ones. But from the beginning certainly from""Into the Wild""onward Stewarts emotional honesty and self-effacing slightly wary charisma have served her well.""Snow White and the Huntsman"" represents an intelligent stretch for the actress best known for the teen-dating guide known as ""Twilight""(three down one to go). With respectable success she handles a suggestion of a British dialect (shes no Kevin Costner in""Robin Hood"" in other words) and while this Snow White is rarely required to speechify -- typical rejoinders here run along the lines of ""Where are we?"" -- a rousing monologue setting up the climactic battle inspired by ""Henry V"" actually works.This is a violent film. Its rougher in fact than ""The Hunger Games.""Ravenna played with fierce wild-eyed commitment by Charlize Theron survives on animal aviary and human hearts and stays young by sucking the life the youth out of her victims. The dwarfs played by Hoskins Ian McShane Toby Jones and other ace character men are dispossessed miners forced to the margins of society rough wee men who lead a rough wee life. The dangers they face are played for high stakes and real pain.First-time feature film director Rupert Sanders worked from a heavily developed script by Evan Daugherty John Lee Hancock and Hossein Amini. Sanders was charged with delivering a producers movie the chief producer being Joe Roth (""Alice in Wonderland""). At its best ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" feels less like a desperate blockbuster and more like a handmade object. Anachronistic wisecracks are nowhere to be found. Its a rather grave adventure and Stewart isnt required to carry the movie but simply do her part affectingly. mjphillipstribune.comSnow White and the Huntsmen -- 3 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for intense sequences of violence and action and brief sensuality)Running time 207Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Movies Entertainment Snow White (fictional character) Kristen Stewart Snow White and the Huntsman (movie) Kevin Costner Mirror Mirror (movie) 10 movies to see this summer Moonrise Kingdom Wes Anderson meticulously crafts a world of yearning  1/2 Snow White and the Huntsman Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising72deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0530-snow-white-huntsman-20120531,0,4589735.column",200,snowwhiteandthehuntsman28,snowwhiteandthehuntsman,chicagotribune
"Snow White and the Huntsman is no Disney fairy tale |       NJ.com comments Snow White and the Huntsman is no Disney fairy tale Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on May 31 2012 at 711 AM View/Post Comments UNIVERSALChris Hemsworth left and Kristen Stewart in a scene from ""Snow White and the Huntsman."" Remember your first Snow White? The movie with the singing dwarves and ""Heigh-Ho"" and all the brightly colored animation? So two generations ago. Okay remember the other one? ""Mirror Mirror"" the one with Julia Roberts and Nathan Lane and the tongue-in-cheek jokes? So three months ago. No now its time for the latest version of the fairy tale -- this one played absolutely straight. Actually a little too straight. True weve gotten too used to getting our fairy tales with a dose of irony and a fistful of show-biz jokes (blame the first ""Shrek"" for that) and certainly thats not the only way to do them. Wish fulfillment secret fears even sexual fantasies -- those are just some of the mysteries those stories contain and why theyve had a sneaky pull on us for hundreds of years. But ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" goes for neither mirth nor metaphor. Instead it plays out like faux Shakespeare with fathers quarreling with sons evil usurpers striding around shouting and a big climactic raid on the palace. Its all well-staged and seriously played. But theres no humor and any magic is strictly computer-generated. The plot follows the basic evil stepmother/witch outline with Charlize Theron locking up Kristen Stewart for being ""fairer"" than she. (Presumably the magic mirror meant ""fair-minded"" -- next to the crystalline adult perfection of Theron Stewart is merely a petulant teen). But then Stewart escapes -- and after the huntsman sent to capture her joins her instead she begins to plot a way to gain back her rightful place on the throne. Unfortunately unlike ""Mirror Mirror"" which had a truly unique and consistent vision the look and feel of ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is all over the place. There are whimsical fairies and a giant monster who wouldnt have been out of place in ""John Carter""; the mood changes from Hammer horror (Theron like ""Countess Dracula"" feeds off the youth of peasant girls) to a messianic mythos that feels borrowed from Narnia. The seven dwarves are nearly forgotten too only showing up a good hour into the film. (Theyre a treat though and benefit from the movies smartest special effect -- director Rupert Sanders has digitally ""shrunk"" some of Britains greatest character actors down to size to play them.) But Stewart remains the glummest grubbiest star out there always looking like she needs two aspirin and a good shampoo in whatever film she makes. Shes fine as a put-upon captive but as a holy virgin warrior meant to lead an army into battle? Shes more like Joan of Snark. And while Chris Hemsworth is his usual sturdy ""Thor"" self as the nameless Huntsman the movie cant decide whether or not it wants him to be a romantic figure (while the suggestion of a possible love triangle with him Snow White and another royal goes nowhere). Theron is terrific (even if she shouts too many of her lines -- a villain as truly powerful as she wouldnt need to speak above a whisper). And there are some striking images -- Theron bathing in a vat of milk the village women who scar themselves so theyre no threat to her vanity. But this still all feels like serious pay-attention-now schoolroom stuff -- Shakespeare without the poetry ""Braveheart"" without the performances. Its grown-up all right. But theres no sense of childlike wonder. And thats one thing that fairy tales always had. Ratings note The film contains violence and sensuality.

"Snow White and the Huntsman (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Snow White and the Huntsman (PG-13) This new version of the classic fairy tale is a bag of rotten apples. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com5/31/2012 Editor rating 1.5 Snow White and the Huntsman is the second movie this year based on the fairy tale of a young princess and her monstrous stepmother.  But where Mirror Mirror opted for froth and camp and tra-la-la this one puts the Grimm back into the story. Ravenna (Charlize Theron) is the name of the witch who raided Chers wardrobe and eats the hearts of little birds off her fingernails like olives. Shes the one who marries a widowed king and murders him on their honeymoon imprisoning his beautiful daughter Snow White (Kristen Stewart). Ravenna is also the really vain one who likes -- no needs -- to feel good about herself. The opening scenes of Snow White and the Huntsman are hushed and serious and full of promise. Director Rupert Sanders a veteran of high-profile TV commercials brings the proper visual majesty and storybook beauty (even the talking mirror looks cool) and the script co-written by Hossein Amini (Drive) seems to have a merciless sense of purpose. And then right about the first time the queen loses her cool and Theron loses all control of her performance the lethargy starts to creep in. Snow White and the Huntsman does lots of things well The problem is that they are all in the same movie. Snows first foray into the dark forest is scary and intense filled with ashen tree branches and winged creatures and giant monsters. Later Snow finds a happy forest filled with sunshine and green grass and furry snakes and fairies riding bunny rabbits. When the eight (soon to be seven) dwarves appear theyre initially odd and menacing (one of them leers at Snow and says ""Shes pretty."") But just as you realize there are famous actors hidden underneath all the latex and wigs (including Ian McShane and Bob Hoskins) the dwarves also turn into comic relief -- funny little men prone to slapstick and hijinks and all the sorts of childish Munchkin business that Game of Thrones Peter Dinklage probably abhors. The huntsman tasked by the queen with tracking down Snow White is played by Chris Hemsworth who had been on quite a roll (Thor The Avengers The Cabin in the Woods) but is now revealed to be merely mortal like everyone else and incapable of saving every movie hes in. And then theres Stewart. The actress has a bum rap of being inexpressive and moribund as Bella in the Twilight movies. But at least shes physically suited for that role. In Snow White and the Huntsman this talented but woefully miscast actress is expected to rally an entire army of soldiers even though she usually looks like she forgot the combination to her locker. And like Tim Burtons Alice in Wonderland the movie breaks from the original story with an elaborate new climax featuring a Braveheart-scale war. This has become the new go-to finale in Hollywood for any fantasy films starring young women. What ever happened to proms?  When Snow rides into battle wielding a sword you want to tell her to put that thing down before she pokes her eye out. And eat a sandwich will ya?

Daily Edition Login to download Snow White and the Huntsman Film Review 240 AM PDT 5/31/2012 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Strikingly designed and cast makeover of the childrens tale into a straight-line romance-free action odyssey. TWITTER This serious take on the fairy tale features arresting visuals surprising imagination and a face-off between the beauty of Kristen Stewart and Charlize Theron. A bold rethinking of a familiar old story and striking design elements are undercut by a draggy midsection and undeveloped characters in Snow White and the Huntsman. After the campy family farce of Mirror Mirror this second revisionist take of the year on the 19th century fairy tale strides out deadly serious and in full armor not to mention with more costume changes for Charlize Theron than a Lady Gaga concert. Designed to appeal to teen and young-adult girls and guys this muscular PG-13 action adventure conspicuously lacks romance but should get a good box-office ride on the shoulders of stars Kristen Stewart and Chris Hemsworth. PHOTOS Snow White and the Huntsman Starring Kristen Stewart Charlize Theron Chris Hemsworth The teeing up is dramatic to say the least giving a swift and dire account of the malevolent usurpation of the throne of a rugged waterfront kingdom by Ravenna (Theron) a stunning blonde who infiltrates from enemy territory bewitches the widowed monarch and dispatches him on their wedding night. The kings daughter is kept prisoner in a high tower until her maturity at which point the queens mirror -- in this case a giant golden plate that morphs into a molten statue -- informs her that the status of fairest in the land has shifted to Snow White (Stewart) who represents the queens greatest threat as well as her salvation. All through this the visual elements are riveting with production designer Dominic Watson and costume designer Colleen Atwood making major statements with their fabulously detailed and rich-looking creations. Initially based on blacks whites and reds the color scheme is slowly expanded to embrace a rich carefully calculated array of hues which first-time director Rupert Sanders whose background is in commercials knows how to show off to maximum effect. PHOTOS 28 of Summers Most Anticipated Movies Avengers Dark Knight Prometheus Woe be to anyone who would permit Snow White to escape. But since the guilty party is the queens albino-ish enforcer brother Finn (Sam Spruell) this unfortunate fellow is merely obliged to follow her into the aptly named Dark Forest to which she has perilously fled and from which the dirty unschooled teenager can only be rescued by a drunken warrior (Hemsworth) another widower who has nothing to lose. Sanders shows a skilled hand for conjuring up dramatic contexts presenting characters making actors look good and stirring up threatening moods. Hes less effective at maintaining interest over the long haul of the midsections lengthy journey as the huntsman leads Snow White through the dreaded forest to a village of women and children and on to a land known as Sanctuary a once-enchanted home to dwarfs sprites and unique animals that has come upon hard times since the evil queen has been in power. VIDEO Snow White and the Huntsman Colleen Atwood on Creating the Fairytale Costumes Although this interlude has its charms stemming from the creature creations as well as the from the lightly amusing characterizations of the little guys by normally robust actors such as Ian McShane Bob Hoskins Ray Winstone and Eddie Marsan the protracted odyssey feels especially flat because its not marked by any deepening of the personalities of the princess and her blade-toting escort or any significant alterations in their relationship. Hemsworths soldier seems too loaded and hung up on his late wife to think too seriously about Snow White but even if he did hed have to defer to William (Sam Claflin) the princesss childhood friend and presumed intended who turns up (with this seasons obligatory weapon the bow and arrow) to join the good fight and install Snow White on her throne back home where she belongs. Every so often the film cuts back to the castle to reveal the queen in distressed states of aging and miraculous rejuvenation the latter alarmingly achieved by sucking the youth out of younger victims. This royal would seem to be a self-made vampire of sorts as well as a forerunner of contemporary youth-obsessed women willing to do almost anything to maintain their beauty and allure. So this is a film of moments of arresting visuals marked seriousness sometimes surprising imagination and with nothing on its mind really except to provide the conventional reassurance of installing a rightful royal on the throne. Its also a film in which you cant help but behold and compare the contrasting beauty of two of the most exceptional-looking women on the screen today Stewart and Theron. Sanders studies both of them closely and from many angles with Stewart nearly always maintaining her ethereal air clenched by angst and determination and Theron expressing a will and mercilessness to rival any despot. Despite the narrow ranges their roles require both command ones attention throughout. Required in their own ways to be gaze-worthy Hemsworth and Claflin bear up in far more constricted parts. Craft and technical contributions are all first-rate. James Newton Howard has composed an unusually somber and nuanced full orchestral score that helpfully amplifies the storys dark moods and currents.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The greatest innovation Snow White And The Huntsman brings to its ""dark retelling"" of the Snow White fairy tale is suggesting that its evil-queen antagonist (played by Charlize Theron) has a name a past and a purpose. And its biggest letdown comes when it abandons that idea entirely in order to turn her into yet another generic baddie an impersonal wall of CGI special effects and grimaces for Snow White (Kristen Stewart) to throw herself against. The first third of the film is cold but thrilling in its suggestion of deeper nuances to the story When Theron marries and murders Stewarts father to become queen she does so with a whispered monologue about the ways men use women and how a king ruined her in the past so she feels no compunction about ruining a different king in the present. She defines her rule by her immortality youth and beauty which she bitterly cites as the central powers of women. There are complicated elements at work here with threads of curdled vengeance victim entitlement and insanity bound together in ways it would take a much smarter film to unravel. Snow White And The Huntsman doesnt try and the film just keeps getting dumber as it goes along. Its flabbergasting that 2012 saw two expansive expensive live-action versions of the Snow White story and the one Tarsem directed is less visually lush and less humorless and stilted. His Mirror Mirror at least had a sense of playfulness; Huntsman is prettier but freighted with the self-importance of old-school fantasy films like Legend or Ladyhawke. After Stewart escapes a life of captivity in Therons castle (Therons refusal to kill her outright is never explained and one of many things that could have been spun out into a more complicated version of the story but instead is left as a bit of generic bad-guy stupidity) Theron sends angry widower Chris Hemsworth into the woods to hunt her down. Meanwhile waiting in those woods are a pack of angry dwarves played by CGI-altered stars including Ian McShane Bob Hoskins Ray Winstone Nick Frost and Toby Jones. As all these elements come together--with the added complication of Stewarts childhood crush Sam Claflin showing up to suggest a love triangle--Stewart eventually becomes a Snow Of Arc figure leading an armed rebellion against the witch. Much like Mirror Mirror Huntsman appears to borrow liberally from other fantasy films. Sometimes the nods are clever--Stewarts first night in the forest among hallucinatory fog that gives the trees faces and clutching hands evokes Disneys animated Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs from 1937. Some are strangely detailed like the hugely antlered white deer-creature-cum-forest-god seemingly stolen whole cloth from Princess Mononoke. But many are just wearying like the de rigueur helicopter-cam scenes of the band of heroes trekking wearily across beautiful landscapes courtesy of every epic fantasy from Krull to The Fellowship Of The Ring to Clash Of The Titans or the lengthy exploration of a CGI fairyland that seems reminiscent of The Dark Crystal. That too is part of the disappointment Huntsman starts out with a vision of Theron thats specific unique and weighted in character but it trends throughout toward generic fantasy tropes and black-and-white morality and climaxes in a thoroughly familiar face-off. Huntsman feints at being the Snow White retelling no one has ever seen before but ultimately becomes the ""been there done that"" of fairy-tale filmmaking.

Its also a world-class illustration of how in the age of the global blockbuster the lust for demographics -- for coralling the largest possible audience -- can determine aesthetics. The movie works so hard to transform a quintessential girl story into a girl-and-guy story that its like three movies in one. The tale of Snow White is of course (along with Cinderella) the reigning princess fantasy in our culture an everygirls dream/nightmare that wallows in an almost rapturous masochism. The relationship between Snow White the alabster-skinned ruby-lipped storybook version of cover-girl perfection and her evil stepmother who is basically a mean-girl Mommie Dearest becomes a passion play of beauty vanity jealousy the fear of aging and the forbidden fruit of growing up. Its an overstuffed jewelry box of feminine obsession. Snow White and the Huntsman makes room for some of these stirrings within its heavy-handed ""revisionist"" take. The best thing in the movie by far is Charlize Therons performance as the scheming snarling Queen Ravenna who is under an empowering spell that allows her to murder at will heal her own wounds and remain eternally youthful in face and body -- that is as long as there is no ""fairer blood"" around in which case the spell will be broken. Ravenna marries then stabs to death Snow Whites widowed father King Magnus (Noah Huntley) and imprisons his young daughter in a stone tower. Then when Snow White matures and blossoms into Kristen Stewart its time for her to be killed as well. Instead she escapes to the Dark Woods. Theron knowingly over-the-top acts in a viciously charged and entertaining style. Wearing a spiky iron crown along with a black scalloped dress that makes her look like a six-foot-tall human bird as if designed by Jean Paul Gaultier she plays Ravenna as mad for power yet theres a timely element of resentment to her viciousness. Ravenna hates living in a world where men can feed on womens beauty and then toss them away. Shes a fascist of feminism and Therons acting has the blood of operatic anger coursing through it. She updates the mythic ripeness of the material. Thats true in a far more tremulous way of Kristen Stewart as well who is just wary and delicate enough of a presence to play ""purity"" without becoming a pain. But when Snow White lands in the Dark Woods Snow White and the Huntsman becomes a very different sort of movie. It turns into a clangy medieval epic full of random woodland monsters and battles and it begins to lose the pulse of its fairy-tale mystique. Its like watching Clash of the Titans IV Revenge of the Blood Apple. The queen through her cringingly devoted brother (Sam Spruell who wears an ugly pageboy hairdo to great effect) has recruited the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) a legendary roving warrior to find Snow White and bring her back to the castle. But Snow White brandishing a reward of gold pieces loses no time enlisting him to be her savior-protector. The Huntsman is played by Chris Hemsworth the Austrialian actor who so wittily escaped boring hunkdom in Thor and The Avengers but here his blond Norse-god tresses have gone drab brown and his performance is a little colorless too. It doesnt help that Snow Whites romantic inclinations remain oddly vague throughout. Does she want to take a bite out of the Huntsman? Or does she still have a nostalgic crush on William (Sam Claflin) her childhood friend? This amorous tug-of-war is I guess supposed to remind us of the Twilight series (talk about letting a franchise tail wag the fairy-tale dog) but in this case the choice comes to very little. And thats a real miscalculation since Stewart is so much more convincing as a victim-hearththrob than she is when shes required to put on armor and lead a revolution. By the end shes supposed to be playing Snow White as Joan of Arc meets Braveheart meets Katniss Everdeen and shes less than authentic on all fronts. Did I mention that there are dwarves? Eight of them? Theyre played by name actors who are fun to recognize beneath their fake-looking Munchkin-meets-Hobbit wigs and makeup (Look its Ian McShanes burning eyes And Bob Hoskins salt-of-the-earth leer) though if someone had thought to give them a few better lines maybe that part of the movie too wouldnt have fallen short.

I resisted this derivative mishmash of classic fairytale and modern epic fantasy for as long as I could but ultimately it swept me up into its geeky but manly embrace and carried me away on a white charger. English commercial director Rupert Sanders makes his feature debut with a splash launching a fantasy-adventure franchise that probably isnt as good as any of the things it references -- the classic Walt Disney film of course but also ""The Lord of the Rings"" the Narnia series ""Game of Thrones"" ""Star Wars"" Shakespeare and countless other works besides -- but comes close enough Id guess to carve out its own niche and create its own fan base.Mind you a lot of things go wrong in ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" so many that its surprising the film feels as exhilarating and entertaining as it finally does. The problems start with the central premise and the leading actress but there are also the wobbly CGI effects uncertain character arcs and unresolved subplots not to mention the regional British Isles accents which may be tough for American viewers to follow. (This is essentially a British film although partly fueled with dollars from Universal Pictures.) Lets accentuate the positive though by beginning with the stunning and sinister Charlize Theron who plays the usurper Queen Ravenna (aka Snow Whites evil stepmother) as a proto-feminist vengeance seeker clad in a succession of delirious lapidary outfits out of Jean Paul Gaultiers nightmares. (The costume designer is the estimable Colleen Atwood.)An embittered beauty determined to resist the aging process -- she has moved on from Botox and plastic surgery to physically sucking the life force out of virgins and flowers it seems -- Ravenna is such a complicated and intriguing character that Sanders and his team of writers run themselves into a version of the infamous ""Satan problem"" from Miltons ""Paradise Lost."" In that epic poem the fallen angel Lucifer who devotes all his energies to perverting and destroying mankind is a much more interesting and indeed appealing character than God a figure singularly lacking in dramatic possibility. It doesnt help that Therons icy but tormented queen completely blows Kristen Stewarts anodyne and somewhat androgynous Snow White off the screen leaving us feeling that the overdetermined pagan-Christian parable at the heart of this story -- the tomboy princess is The One to whom ancient forest beasts bow down The One who will make the land bloom again -- is both unfair and rather dull.Im a fan of Stewarts generally speaking and will irritatingly add that I always think of her first and foremost as ""that girl from Adventureland."" She badly needs to get out of the business of playing storybook virginal princess types however and I hope she and the people around her have enough sense not to let Bella define the rest of her career. (I havent seen ""On the Road"" yet; maybe that will help.) She cuts a fetching line in both gowns and suits of armor but this Snow White -- who is sometimes Bilbo Baggins (and sometimes his Ring) sometimes Luke Skywalker sometimes Joan of Arc and sometimes Henry V -- calls for both broad hambone instincts and a natural aristocratic bearing. Stewart possesses neither looking and acting rather too much like a standoffish American girl faking a posh accent.In fairness I have no idea whom else Id have cast or how well shed have done. Sanders and his writers -- the story is by Evan Daugherty who co-wrote the screenplay with John Lee Hancock and Hossein Amini -- never quite decide whether theyre doing a sardonic young-adult update of the 1937 Disney classic or cutting themselves free from that material and going back to its roots in European folklore. Mostly in fact its the former If the scene where Snow White gets lost in the forest scared you when you were 5 they seem to say wait till you see the super-scary haunted forest weve got for you now Cute bunnies? Were doubling down on the cuteness Seven dwarves you say? Well OK then -- but lets make them debauched violent pseudo-Celtic little bastards (The gang of dwarves includes Ian McShane Bob Hoskins Ray Winstone and Toby Jones who are rendered small through both newfangled and old-fashioned trickery and are highly enjoyable overall.) You Might Also Like Sanders mounts an impressive faux-medieval spectacle in the first third of the film although he has little gift for action and therefore the battle scenes are uniformly disappointing. We see how Ravenna seduces and destroys Snow Whites father locking the child princess in the tower and seizing the crown for herself. The resemblance to HBOs ""Game of Thrones"" (and the George R.R. Martin books behind it) may be coincidental but it is nonetheless strong and the intrigue even includes a semi-incestuous relationship between Ravenna and her perverted brother Finn (Sam Spruell) whose lecherous advances upon Snow White give her an opportunity to escape. Not daring to pursue the girl into the Dark Forest Finn hires a drunken widowed huntsman with no known name (Chris Hemsworth of ""Thor"" and ""The Avengers"") to fetch her back so his enraged sister can tear Snow Whites heart from her breast and thereby live forever.Theres no denying that taking the repentant huntsman a brief and buffoonish cameo role in ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" and making him the ennobled working-class hero of the whole story is an ingenious twist. Whether it pays off Im not sure. Hemsworth is an agreeable action hero with tremendous charisma and the long midsection of this movie as Snow White and the huntsman go on a Tolkienian voyage of adventure and discovery is both enjoyable and predictable. Stewarts best and most delicate acting in fact comes as Snow White begins to wrestle with the unexpected possibility that this uncouth muscleman -- and not the effete aristocratic William (Sam Claflin) who has loved her since childhood -- may be her real Prince Charming. I dont think I can be accused of issuing spoilers when it comes to a fairytale but lets leave a faint shroud of mystery over precisely how this triangle is resolved or not resolved. Ravennas delivery of the poisoned apple to Snow White is brilliantly done perhaps the movies best revisionist moment but after that the momentum declines sharply. Snow White ""dies"" and is revived -- more mysteriously and with less emotional impact than in the Disney film -- and then she must lead her rebel troops into battle delivering a knockoff version of the St. Crispins Day inspirational speech from ""Henry V"" (which Stewart frankly cant pull off at all). This is a big crude cynical and impressive movie that will leave almost any viewer with mixed feelings partly because it kills off its best character in what seems like an irrevocable fashion. It ends by virtually begging us to call for a sequel stopping just short of an on-screen ellipsis and question mark. Im inclined to conclude that ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is a vigorous simulacrum of classic fantasy rather than the real thing. But keep your expectations reasonable and thats enough to make it one of the summers unexpected delights. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Snow White and the Huntsman Fair to good DirectorRupert Sanders. Cast Kristen Stewart Chris Hemsworth Charlize Theron. Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action and brief sensuality. Director Rupert Sanders with his first feature has come up with some jaw droppingly beautiful shots almost tactile in their richness and uses special effects to enhance that look rather than just showing off. His actors unfortunately are not always so inspired. Charlize Theron puts a lot of effort into trying to infuse Ravenna the Evil Queen with an oozing evil but Chris Hemsworth after a promising start eventually doesnt have much to do as the Huntsman (thats the only name hes given). And then there is Kristen Stewart as Snow White. Her performance is uneven and while thats a step up from her portrayal of Bella Swan in the ""Twilight"" films its not really enough to carry the movie. Oh shes not bad and at times shes good. Just not all the time. The story hits the ground running. Snow Whites mother dies and her grieving father is duped into a war against a mysterious army. His side wins and they take a single prisoner Ravenna. Stunned by her beauty he marries her the next day -- and she promptly kills him on their wedding night though not before saying ""Men use women. They ruin us."" She takes over the kingdom and imprisons Snow White. Ravenna is obsessed with her own beauty but its more than just vanity. It is also the source of her power which is considerable and tends toward the dark side. Very dark. She depends upon the youth beauty and occasional beating heart of young women to ward off aging and the diminishment it brings. She asks the mirror -- which is more like a gold version of the T-1000 played by Robert Patrick in ""Terminator 2 Judgment Day"" than a looking glass -- who is the fairest of them all of course but there is some fear mixed in with the question. And you know what the answer eventually must be. This leads to Snow Whites escape into the Dark Forest where no one wants to go. Ravenna orders the Huntsman to fetch her and bring her back alive so that she can eat her heart. (Told you very dark.) The Huntsman is a drunkard whose wife has died. He doesnt want to take the job but he doesnt really have any choice. So he leads Finn (Sam Spruell who is very good) the queens brother and some other men on the hunt. Meanwhile William (Sam Claflin) a childhood friend who still pines for Snow White gets wind of her escape so he pursues her as well. The stage is set for a rivalry that never really gels. The Huntsman finds her first and rather than take her back to Ravenna he trains her as a fighter. The Queens troops are never far behind; their chase is what leads the Huntsman and Snow White to the eight -- not seven -- dwarves. Sneezy and Dopey theyre not. At first they want to kill the pair and feed them to the wolves. But once Snow Whites lineage is established -- and her powers as well -- they come around. (Sanders cast full-sized actors like Ian McShane Bob Hoskins and Ray Winstone as the dwarves digitally shrinking them.) It becomes clear to Snow White and to everyone else that she must lead the revolt against the queen. After some self-doubt (""How will I inspire? How will I lead men?"") events lead her to make a speech to rally the troops. Its not exactly Henry Vs St. Crispins Day Speech but it seems to get the job done. All the classic elements are here -- the mirror the poison apple true loves kiss. The climactic battle provides a fitting end but its too long getting there; the movie last more than two hours and feels like it. This isnt to say that ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" isnt without its strengths. Its better than ""Mirror Mirror"" the other more-lighthearted telling of the fairy tale that came out earlier this year. With its sumptuous look and its revisionist take it has its moments.

The Dark Forest you flee to in ""Snow White amp; the Huntsman"" slithers and hisses with dangerous treachery while that evil Queen who killed Daddy and then imprisoned you in a tower is saddled with deep psychological scars. Not only is she shackled to her beauty but shes been horribly wronged by the opposite sex.And then theres the band of dwarves you stumble upon Theyre not cute certainly not cuddly and boy do they ever need to take a long soak in a hot bath. For that matter so does everyone else in this atmospheric rehash of the classic Brothers Grimm tale. Snows enchanting tale has been enjoying a lively renaissance with variations of her plight popping up everywhere from movies (""Mirror Mirror"" with Julia Roberts) to TV (ABCs ""Once Upon a Time"").""Snow White amp; the Huntsman"" turns out to be one of the best of the bunch.Thats due largely to the obvious toil and trouble taken to build such a darkly imagined fantasy world one thats a far cry from the more family-friendly environment Walt Disney envisioned for his 1937 animated classic. The amazing visuals and set pieces are evocative and stunning from the misty-shrouded Dark Forest and its gnarled limbs to the stark bird-infested chambers of the castle thats home to the tyrannical queen.Advertisement Second to that is a deliciously over-the-top performance from Charlize Theron as Queen Ravenna the madwoman hellbent on ripping out the heart of her stepdaughter Snow White (""Twilights"" Kristen Stewart) so she can preserve a beauty that is both blessing and curse. Snow does earn top billing but dont be fooled This film belongs to the Oscar-winning Theron who sinks her talons into the killer part making every snarl and outburst such wicked cruel fun to behold. Stewart is fine as Snow but her sullen demeanor doesnt exactly inspire the sense of hope the role demands even if its refreshing to see this good actress not playing a drip like Bella. Its also a shame that the climactic showdown between Snow and the Queen feels like a bit of a rush job. The mostly sturdy script by the screenwriting team of Evan Daugherty John Lee Hancock and Hossein Amini also hits a few bumps taking shortcuts to propel the story along without filling in the details. But such imperfections in first-time director Rupert Sanders surreal epic fantasy dont ruin the overall effect just tarnish it a little. The production details are splendidly realized with Therons performance bolstered by the high-caliber craft of costume designer Colleen Atwood. I especially love the gown with bird skulls adorning the top of her bodice. The performances in secondary roles also assist in carrying out this somber tone. In his more expanded role as the huntsman a scruffy Chris Hemsworth (""Thor"") looks like he stepped right off the cover of a romance novel but needs a day at the spa. Meanwhile the seven dwarves -- led by ""Deadwoods"" Ian McShane Ray Winstone Toby Jones and Bob Hoskins -- provide the right amount of comic relief and naughtiness while not ruining the tone by overplaying the humor. They arrive late in the game to chug mead squabble dance with Snow and help her out. Also good are Sam Spruell with his Moe-from-the-Three Stooges haircut as Ravennas creepy brother and the handsome Sam Claflin as Snows childhood friend.Undoubtedly this tougher ""Snow White"" will turn off those expecting swoon-worthy romance and a breezy heigh-ho tone. All I can say to that is just Grimm and bear it.Snow White amp; the Huntsman    Rating PG-13 (for intense sequences of violence and action and a brief scene of sensuality)Cast Kristen Stewart Charlize Theron Chris Hemsworth Sam Claflin Ian McShaneDirector Rupert SandersRunning time 2 hours 7 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Review Holocaust haunts family in The GatheringReview In Hearts of Palm bumbling corporation aims to plunder paradiseReview In Bad Moms fast food and booze spike the stress of motherhood Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

The script for Snow White and the Huntsman seems to anticipate this sort of grilling and provides answers in spades. The result is a film thats considerably longer than it needs be in which the evocative eloquence of storybook pictures is consistently garbled by the need to overexplain and psychoanalyze. Evil Queen Ravenna (Charlize Theron) marries her way to the throne and then drives threateningly fair Snow White (Kristen Stewart) into exile. An unruly subject Huntsman Eric (Thors Chris Hemsworth) is sent into the Dark Forest to finish Snow off while Prince William (Sam Claflin) who remembers the princess from her girlhood likewise sets on her trail. The setting is a palpably lived-in late-medieval universe of scrofulous peasantry and pervasive under-the-fingernails murk and mire where everything on-screen has a conceivable use and looks used. The same detail applies to the fantasy aspects of Snows world including a Dark Forest alive with all things that slither and skitter. But for all this Snow Whites visual ornamentation theres no sense of narrative priority--the filmmakers cant see the Dark Forest for the trees.

Mere months after Mirror Mirror--Tarsem Singhs frenetically hyperstylized take on the beloved bedtime story about a fair maiden an evil queen and seven dwarfs--comes first-time feature director Rupert Sanderss surprisingly solemn retelling. A too-bustling prologue shows how Queen Ravenna (Charlize Theron camping it up) usurped power poisoned the land and imprisoned her stepdaughter rival Snow White (Kristen Stewart a delight). But then the film finds surer footing and proceeds with a deliberateness rare in a big-budget franchise starter; you can sense the hand of coscreenwriter Hossein Amini (Drive) in the storys always involving slow-build structure. The very strong early scenes are practically a chamber drama as Ravenna skulks around the castle longing for everlasting power and beauty (her mirror on the wall is a burnished disc that strikingly morphs into a faceless golden figure) and Snow figures out a way to escape captivity. Yet once the scope widens to include the dwarfs--creepily played by a bunch of normal-height British character actors with their heads transposed onto small bodies--and the loutish huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) who proves to be our heroines Prince Charming the movie becomes a more conventional fantasy adventure in the Lord of the Rings vein. The rousing speeches and booming battle scenes are all well done as far as blockbuster spectacle goes but you cant help but feel the filmmakers resistance to the storys grimmer undercurrents. The moral is clear Indulge the baser desires of the multiplex masses above all else.

The results are rarely pretty - anyone recall Snow White A Tale of Terror? - but its hard to remember an example quite as embarrassingly misguided as Snow White and the Huntsman.Kristen Stewart plays Snow White the daughter of a benevolent king whos bumped off by his maniacal man-hating wife Ravenna (Charlize Theron) aka the Wicked Queen. Fleeing to the Dark Forest (the film is full of these obnoxious postmodern look its a fairytale touches) Snow White makes the acquaintance of the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) a rough-diamond loner with a dark past and the worst Glaswegian accent since Mike Myers did Fat Bastard.Pretty average so far. But then the dwarfs turn up and the true horror begins. Wait thats not Bob Hoskins is it? And it cant possibly be... Ray Winstone? But it is - and Toby Jones Ian McShane Nick Frost Johnny Harris and Eddie Marsan too. The cream of British acting talent has been digitally shrunken and saddled with haircuts that make them look like a midget Slade tribute band gambolling about in a forest glade so sickeningly CG-sweet it looks like an advert for air freshener.Unsurprisingly its all downhill from there. Perhaps the filmmakers thought that having Stewart strap on a scabbard and go looking for some queenly ass to kick would make this a modern girl-power parable but in fact the opposite is true by placing so much focus on Therons preening psychologically scarred Ravenna the film feels deeply reactionary. The tone is wildly uneven skipping from humourless knockabout slapstick to bizarre psychedelic whimsy to sub-Game of Thrones swordplay without ever getting close to likeable or charming. The result is witless heartless and dull. Even the Twi-hards are going to want their money back.

There were sub-plots that were hinted at but never materialised like any form of romance plot at all. The original fairytale was overridden by the need for yet more intense running and falling over. The script was terribly-paced and filled with continuity errors and whoever wrote the complete gibberish that was Snow Whites inspiring battle speech should consider changing careers. Its a film that doesnt know what genre its aiming for so makes a clumsy stab at all of them - we got scary silly childish and over-dramatic action all in one. Visually stunning you can tell that every penny was spent on the artistry of it and its a shame that the writing and acting were utterly neglected in favour of the admittedly fabulous look of the film. A first-time director and first-time writers frankly should not be at the helm of something this over-hyped and big-budgeted. The story was painfully bad and the acting only compounded the failure. A total screw up from start to finish.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 4 2012ZaraFeaturedThe best film Ive seen in a long time. That review is a load of rubbish.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Grimm and Grimmer The dwarves in the dark Snow White and the Huntsman dont do much singing. _ By David Edelstein Published May 28 2012 ShareThis (Photo The Mill/Courtesy of Universal Pictures) When a friends little daughter became upset recently watching the beauteous Buttercup in the fun 1987 mock fairy tale The Princess Bride do little to help the hero slay the Rodent of Unusual Size I realized wed crossed a bridge Damsels in distress can no longer be rescued by handsome men at least until theyve proved they can rescue themselves. Snow White and the Huntsman the latest adaptation of one of the Brothers Grimms most beloved fairy tales is not your fathers Snow Whiteand more to the point not your Uncle Walts. Nightmarishly brutal set against wintry landscapes and medieval battlements and rife with hopeless starving peasants its practically a full-bore horror picture reminiscent of Game of Thrones Joan of Arc and Countess Draculathe one where the title character inspired by Elizabeth Bathory stays youthful by bathing in the blood of young women. Its also strongly influenced by a lot of smart feminist thinking about why Snow White has so much staying powerand why the story is better when its the heroine who slays the monstrous matriarch. The theme is spelled out in the opening scenes in which Queen Ravenna (Charlize Theron) slaughters her newest king in bed while hissing that for women who have been historically subjugated beauty is power. Everything Ravenna has depends on her looks and the ultimate judgment is delivered in the male voice of a golden-molten mirror that takes near-human form. In the first Grimm version the Queen was Snow Whites mother rather than her stepmotherthe brothers altered it when they realized it was too close to the bone for their audience. But the hatred here is still primal. Ravennas jealousy of Snow White (Kristen Stewart) isnt presented as mere vanity. She wants literally to devour the girls heart the corollary to putting an infant to the breast in the mind of a mother perverted by the world of men. Nature itself is sucked dry by the Queens thirst for beauty. Kristen Stewart is not an obvious choice for Snow White given her habitual expression of discomfort while striking conventional feminine posesboth in movies and on red carpets. Thats why of course shes right for this Snow White imprisoned in a tower during puberty and with no regard for her looks She has integrity inner beauty. How do I inspire? How do I lead men? she asks the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) a grief-stricken drunk who teaches Snow White how to stab her opponents by using the weight of their onrushing bodies against them. Shes not a barrel of laughs but then unlike recent fractured fairy tales such as Tangled and the campy Mirror Mirror Snow White and the Huntsman doesnt have a single (intentional) laugh. The language is high-flown the cast unsmiling. Its a shock when the dwarves (there are eight and they dont sing) debate killing Snow and the Huntsman (Skewer him leave her to rot) and a bigger shock when we recognize some of their faces What the hell its Ian McShane Ray Winstone Eddie Marsan Toby Jones Nick Frost and Bob Hoskins on little bodies Howd they do that? Director Rupert Sanders comes from the world of commercials and Xbox games Hes good with images and not good at all at making them flow together which means lots of choppy swordplay and tacky slow motion. But the movies revisionist tone is startlingly enough to carry you along. The goddessy Theron is a thrilling sight in designer Colleen Atwoods raven cloak. The actress has no middle register either declaiming mightily (in close-up) or turning quiet and desolate as wrinkles spread over her faceas theyre apt to do before her next infusion of youth. Stewarts Snow knows Ravenna is more to be pitied than skewered. Maybe for that reason shes the first Snow White not to end up in a clinch with her prince happily indifferent to the verdicts of men or mirrors. You can almost hear her future mother-in-law She doesnt cook she doesnt clean  Snow White and the Huntsman Directed by Rupert Sanders. Universal. PG-13. Share this story...
