Comments Treasure Planet Robert Louis Stevensons Treasure Island becomes a rousing SF adventure in this animated Disney feature by John Musker and Ron Clements whose previous collaborations include Aladdin and The Little Mermaid. Picked up by robocops for joyriding on his jet-powered aerial skateboard fatherless teen Jim Hawkins seems destined for juvenile hall but after finding a virtual-reality map to a hidden treasure he boards a space galleon and sets off on a character-building intergalactic journey. The screenplay by Musker Clements and Rob Edwards takes some other liberties with the novel the pirate Long John Silver becomes a father figure dispensing positive self-esteem (""You got the makings of greatness in ya"") and instead of a peg leg and parrot he has a robotic limb and a shape-shifting imp called Morph. But its laced with literate humor (""Let me make this as monosyllabic as possible"" quips one character) and the directors cite N.C. Wyeths illustrations for the 1911 Scribners edition of Treasure Island as the inspiration for their marvelously detailed fantasy world. Featuring the voices of Emma Thompson David Hyde Pierce Martin Short Brian Murray and Roscoe Lee Browne. 95 min.

Yet the films total appeal may be undercut by a script that rarely feels inspired. Only six years since ""Muppet Treasure Island"" -- the last Disney version of the Robert Louis Stevenson classic already filmed at least 30 times -- the Mouse House is back with yet another PG-rated variation. ""Treasure Planet"" starts with the clever idea of transforming the story into an old-fashioned space opera and the animated visuals are handily up to the studios best. Yet the films total appeal may be undercut by a script that rarely feels inspired. Although theres a hefty built-in audience for this highly accessible entry both theatrical and down the line in video B.O. is unlikely to match the usual Disney holiday standard. Among the many previous versions of ""Treasure Island"" pic has a specific antecedent in ""Treasure Island in Outer Space"" an eight-hour West German/Italo 1987 mini-series directed by Antonio Margheriti (Anthony Dawson) and starring Anthony Quinn and Ernest Borgnine. Writers-directors John Musker and Ron Clements and their crew have applied a risky strategy to the transformation of the setting one that mostly works While the original books ocean has been replaced by outer space and its rough crew of pirates by a variety of alien space sailors the filmmakers have retained many of the period elements. The intergalactic space vessels still look like 17th century sailing ships but with sails powered by solar rays rather than wind. (Everyone human and alien seems to breathe quite easily in the interstellar vacuum.) With a narrator recounting the tale of notorious space pirate Captain Flint and his legendary treasure viewers quickly learn that what theyre seeing is a futuristic storybook reading itself to a very young Jim Hawkins (Austin Majors). Dissolve to 12 years later Jim is now a troubled 15-year-old (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) with a penchant for getting in hot water. He lives with his mother (Laurie Metcalf) who has been running a modest inn by herself ever since her husband took a powder some years earlier. One day Billy Bones (Patrick McGoohan) arrives and promptly expires leaving an intriguing metal sphere. When Jim accidentally figures out how to open the device he discovers a holographic 3-D map presumably leading to the fabled Treasure Planet where Flints loot is stashed. Of course Long John Silver (Brian Murray) and his pirate buddies arent far behind. After they arrive in search of the map and end up burning down the inn Jim decides to venture off to Treasure Planet accompanied by the fussy dog-like Doctor Doppler (David Hyde Pierce). They hire a ship under the command of the feline Captain Amelia (Emma Thompson) and her first mate Mr. Arrow (Roscoe Lee Browne). Unfortunately crew includes Long John Silver and his gang who plan to mutiny and take the treasure for themselves. Musker and Clements have been very faithful to the original story. With the exception of a romantic subplot involving the doggy Doppler and the catty Captain ""Treasure Planet"" cleaves closely to Stevensons tried-and-true plot. It would have been easy to simply convert everything into its science-fiction equivalent but the result would have been far less visually interesting. Long Johns peg leg is now a robotic prosthetic; his parrot has become a ""Morph"" an adorable sidekick who can change into any shape; the loony Ben Gunn has become the chip-damaged robot B.E.N. (Martin Short). The juxtaposition of 21st -century hardware and 17th-century woodwork makes for an always-amusing hybrid. Likewise James Newton Howards score ingeniously blends ""Star Wars"" orchestral bombast with Celtic-sounding sea chantey themes. If only the script were as amusing as the visuals. Musker and Clements have been responsible for ""The Little Mermaid"" ""Aladdin"" and the less commercially successful but very funny ""Hercules."" Yet outside of the cleverness of the basic conceit and the inventiveness of the modernized characters humor is in short supply. Nonetheless Pierce is almost as funny as he was in the misbegotten ""Osmosis Jones"" doing a variation on his standard Niles Crane character and Thompson manages to deliver her lines in a wonderfully clipped accent and at a dizzying speed. But they dont have much to work with despite a setup that would seem well suited for comic asides. The action scenes may satisfy the kids; and the correlations to the original should amuse adults who know the book or one of the many film versions. In the end however the listlessness of the script particularly during the final half hour leaves only visual invention to keep the auds eyes on the screen.

Movie review Treasure Planet ( out of four) Most noteworthy is the artful way it combines the futuristic and the retro. Space travel takes place on a vessel that looks like a tall ship a stately galleon with billowing masts but its also rocket-powered. Jim Hawkins (voiced by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a fatherless teenage boy who yearns to make a name for himself and earn the respect of his mother who struggles financially keeping a boardinghouse. Jim stumbles onto a mysterious treasure map which leads him on an intergalactic journey along with family friend Dr. Doppler (voiced by David Hyde Pierce). The captain of the ship is a take-charge female alien (of the same species as Doppler) whose clipped commands and efficient orders are voiced perfectly by Emma Thompson. She puts Jim under the command of the ships cook a cyborg named John Silver (Brian Murray). Silver acts as a surrogate father to the lad but we learn hes not all he seems. Jim had been given a cryptic warning to ""beware the cyborg"" but the two find themselves striking a wary friendship nonetheless. Jim and other crewmembers (sort of an animated version of the Star Wars bar aliens) must contend with a space storm and a black hole as well as an impending mutiny led by Silver who proves to be more pirate than padre. Once they reach their destination a deserted planet Jim meets B.E.N. (Martin Short) an alien who has literally lost his mind. The jabbering B.E.N. provides comic relief but is also an annoying fixture. Treasure Planet doesnt have the charm of Disneys last homegrown release Lilo amp; Stitch or the dazzling artistry of Spirited Away. But its a capable and diverting holiday season adventure for a family audience.

Starring voices of Brian Murray Emma Thompson David Hyde Pierce and Martin Short. Written and directed by Ron Clements and John Musker. (PG. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Treasure Planet"" was halfway over before the audience made a sound. It wasnt that people werent enjoying themselves. More likely they were so agog at the spectacle they couldnt manage a peep. Lets say this when the Disney people go after your holiday dollar they dont leave anything in the paint box. Onscreen (especially in the IMAX version) the sky is an ethereal pink the light is a golden glow and the lush backgrounds are suitable for framing. The Disney cartoon roots are in there somewhere but this is an oil painting come to life. Of course so was ""Atlantis The Lost Empire"" another Disney animation dazzler that sank like its namesake without a bubble. We can go on and on about the 350 ""artists technicians and animators"" and the 4 1/2 years spent blending computer graphics and hand-drawn characters for ""Treasure Planet"" but you are never going to be the next ""Lion King"" if the plot doesnt hold up. The solution was to go with a story with legs -- one of them peg -- from the 1883 classic ""Treasure Island."" The result is Robert Louis Stevenson meets Tony Hawk -- in space. Jim Hawkins is a teen with a tude recklessly riding his spaceboard on the brink of disaster. Say you dont suppose that boarding skill will come in handy in a climactic final scene do you? Hawkins is as close to a rebel without a cause as one is likely to find in a PG film. Hes got a ponytail an earring and a bad rep with the cyber-cops. No tattoo though so you know hes a good kid who has just made a few bad choices. In a few quick scenes he finds a treasure map hops a spaceship and is off into the great beyond. There he meets the real star of our show John Silver. (Hes not ""Long"" anymore although no one explains why.) Silver voiced by stage actor Brian Murray is the make-or-break core of the movie. If kids buy into Silver it could be a very merry Christmas for ""Treasure Planet."" Hes a big sprawling character with a whirring mechanical arm but more than that hes charming scary crafty kind dangerous and weird. Full marks for Murrays Irish brogue which embraces the authentic seafaring blarney. From there the characters just keep coming. David Hyde Pierce (Niles on TVs ""Frasier"") gets off a few good lines but he is handicapped by the fact that his character looks like Goofys less attractive brother. Martin Short is fine in the inevitable role of the comic stream-of-consciousness character. The problem is that Robin Williams retired that franchise in ""Aladdin"" and everyone else is in distant second place. Academy Award winner Emma Thompson does a nice bit of slumming at the kit- cat captain of the ship. Not only does Thompson bite off her lines with panache but her characters slinky look may stir some unexpected yearnings in some young viewers. Still the real star of the show is the animation. The scenes with the ship under sail are so dazzling that apparently no one ever notices that there is no oxygen in space. Maybe as one cataclysmic action sequence follows another they are all holding their breath.

"CNN.com - Review Treasure Planet strikes gold - Nov. 27 2002 CNN Europe CNN Asia Languages --------- Spanish Portuguese German Italian Korean Arabic Japanese On CNN TV Transcripts Headline News CNN International About CNN.com Preferences Home Page World U.S. Weather Business Sports Politics Law Technology Science amp; Space Health Entertainment Travel Education Special Reports SERVICES Video E-mail Newsletters CNNtoGO SEARCH Web CNN.com Special Report | Calendar | Quiz | Hot Movies Review Treasure Planet strikes gold Outer-space version of classic works wonderfully By Paul ClintonCNN Reviewer Flying space galleons are a part of ""Treasure Planet."" Story Tools RELATED  CNN.com  Reviews archive  EW.com EW.COM  Movie reviews (CNN) -- Robert Louis Stevensons novel ""Treasure Island"" has been committed to film at least 30 times. Now Disney is giving the classic tale an inventive twist by animating the action and spinning it into outer space. The result ""Treasure Planet"" is a truly wonderful tale combined with stunning animation. The rip-roaring ""Treasure Planet"" is a unique cross between the futuristic ""Star Wars"" and Stevensons time-honored tome one of the great pirate stories in literature. The brilliant conceit of the film is while it does take place in the far reaches of the galaxy it also maintains the outward veneer of a good old fashion 18th-century swashbuckler with space vehicles that resemble sailing galleon ships -- albeit ships manned by strange aliens using billowing solar sails. Its a bit odd that everyone both human and alien can breathe in outer space but why sweat the details. The heart of the story remains intact. Jim Hawkins -- voiced by Joseph Gordon-Levitt best known for his role as Tommy Solomon in the TV series ""Third Rock From The Sun"" -- is a young man who has found a 3-D holographic treasure map leading to the legendary lost gold of the notorious space pirate Captain Flint. Making the journey On his trip Jack Hawkins (center) is accompanied by Doctor Doppler (left) and Captain Amelia. In an effort to recover the fortune Jim leaves his mother (voiced by Laurie Metcalf) behind and along with the fussy dog-like professor Doctor Doppler (""Frasiers"" David Hyde Pierce) he signs up for an intergalactic expedition aboard a glittering space galleon. Hes quickly befriended by the ships cook Long John Silver (Brian Murray) a charismatic cyborg -- part man part machine -- who is not necessarily what he seems. With a nod to the futuristic themes of the film Long Johns peg leg is now replaced by a robotic prosthetic and his parrot has changed into a creature called Morph who can transform into any shape it wants. The ship is commanded by the feline Captain Amelia (Emma Thompson) and her first mate Mr. Arrow (Roscoe Lee Browne). Unbeknownst to them Silver is planning a mutiny. Most of the motley crew is secretly under his command and once the ship is far out into the galaxy they attempt to take over the galleon and steal the map from Hawkins and Doppler. Along the way -- when theyre not fighting each other -- they encounter black holes they battle supernovas and they fight an enormous space storm. Innovative animation The films animation is startling particularly in IMAX format says Paul Clinton. Screenwriters Ron Clements John Musker (who also co-produced and directed) and Rob Edwards have stayed fairly close to Stevensons original tale with a few exceptions the main one being a romance between the ships captain and the hapless Doppler. Visually this space opera is highly innovative. Hand-drawn animation is combined with elaborate 3D ""virtual sets"" that jump off the screen -- especially if youre seeing it at one of the large-format IMAX theaters now showing this movie around the country. Clements and Musker have had a lot of experience transferring myth legend and lore to the big screen. The duo also created other Disney blockbusters including ""The Little Mermaid"" (1989) and ""Aladdin"" (1992). ""Treasure Planet"" may not be in that league but it is solid entertainment. ""Treasure Planet"" opens nationwide on Wednesday November 27.

Treasure Planet wants to be ""Treasure Island"" crossed with ""Star Wars"" but the desperation of the Disney animators is right there in the ongepatshket mesh of that concept. The movie which features the spectacle of triple-masted pirate ships in space and not a heck of a lot else could almost be a metaphor for the awkwardness of retrofitting hand-drawn animation to the computer age. From the moment that young Jim Hawkins (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who surely represents the dregs of Spielbergian Fatherless Boy syndrome climbs aboard his mighty galleon the movie is all cutesy updated fripperies and zero momentum. (The blustery matey John Silver is now a cyborg with a robo-arm and so forth.) Quite honestly you could nap for an hour and not miss a thing but when the crew finally makes it to the glowing piles of booty at Treasure Planets core the film unleashes some pleasing visual fireworks. Thats where it should have started not ended. Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories Harry Potter and the Cursed Child Go inside the opening gala J.K.
