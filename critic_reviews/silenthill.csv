"Silent Hill | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; silent-hill ) Silent Hill (United States/France/Japan 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli When it comes to movies based on computer games Silent Hill is not the Holy Grail but its a step in the right direction. The film is overlong with too many unnecessary scenes (a lot of the movie seems like pointless running around) but it packs in a few scary moments and offers a nicely ambiguous conclusion. In Silent Hill atmosphere trumps storyline. The movie is creepy throughout but the plot seems designed primarily for those with ""insider"" knowledge of the game. It takes a lot of thought to decipher and Im not sure all the clues are there. Nevertheless I understood enough of what was going on not to feel completely lost although I dont know if I could explain everything in a convincing fashion. As the film opens young Sharon Da Silva (Jodelle Ferland) is in the grip of a bad dream that has taken her out of her house and to the edge of a cliff. Nightmares and sleepwalking have become a regular part of her nightly regimen and her parents differ about what should be done. Christopher (Sean Bean) the practical one believes that medicine and time in a hospital will cure Sharon. His wife Rose (Radha Mitchell) disagrees. She decides to take Sharon to visit the mysterious locale in which her nightmares take place - the abandoned town of Silent Hill which sits atop a mine that has been on fire for three decades. Rose and Sharons arrival in Silent Hill is brutal. They are involved in an automobile accident when Rose swerves to avoid a girl who dashes into the road. When Rose recovers consciousness her daughter is gone. Rose tries to phone Christopher but her cell phone wont function properly. Accompanied by Cybil Bennett (Laurie Holden) a police officer who pursued her into Silent Hill Rose sets off in search of Sharon. At its best the town is an eerie place - a crumbling relic with the sun hidden by a fog created by falling ash. At its worst during periods of inexplicable blackness it becomes hell on earth with demonic beings and zombies rising up from the ground. I have never played the game Silent Hill but that didnt stop me from appreciating some of what director Christophe Gans (who displayed a similar visual flair in Brotherhood of the Wolf) puts on the screen - although I suspect aficionados will have a better grasp of what is transpiring. Silent Hill looks great. The town is suitably eerie and the periods of darkness are ominous. The movie is all about visual appeal feel and tone because the story underwhelms. The plot concerns Rose tracking down Sharon going from place to place and following clues until she discovers the truth about her daughter and Silent Hills dark past. Meanwhile Sean Bean is wasted as Christopher. His subplot could have been excised. All he does is wander around mostly in the rain learning the towns history and trying to find out the fate of his wife and daughter. One expects a payoff from his activities but there isnt one. Radha Mitchell normally does smaller movies but her experience from Pitch Black serves her well here; shes credible as a mother who will fight off hoards of dead to save her daughter. Although the supporting cast is not littered with household names it features a few recognizable faces. In addition to Bean theres Deborah Kara Unger Kim Coates and Alice Krige. Krige is no less sinister here than she was as the Borg Queen in Star Trek First Contact. With a running time 30 minutes shorter and a less baffling storyline Silent Hill might have been a real winner. One can forgive the cheesy dialogue - this is after all not Shakespeare - and the predictably gory climax. But I dont like leaving a movie feeling that I missed out on something in some way. This is an improvement over game-to-movie clunkers like Resident Evil and Doom but it shows that filmmakers have more work to do if they want to make a movie with appeal that spreads beyond a core audience. Its somewhat of a mystery however why Sony didnt hold any advance screenings. Silent Hill does not reek of the rot that usually clings to movies withheld from the critics until opening day.

By Christy Lemire updated 4/21/2006 43019 PM ET 2006-04-21T203019 Print Font + - REVIEW Lets start with the running time for ""Silent Hill"" two hours and five minutes. Totally out of control. No horror movie should be longer than an Oscar winner for best picture unless its like ""The Exorcist."" (""Crash"" was just 107 minutes when it came out last year in case youre curious.) It should max out around 83 minutes -- 85 tops -- especially when its not even good enough to be shown to critics before opening day. This makes ""Silent Hill"" the 12th movie so far this year that wasnt made available for review ahead of time. But whos counting? Having said that the story of a mother (Radha Mitchell) who brings her sick daughter (Jodelle Ferland) to a West Virginia ghost town with hopes of curing her does have some genuinely frightening imagery. It all seems rather drug-induced though paranoid delusional visions of being covered in enormous crawling bugs; gnarled burning children staggering about menacingly; a muscular giant in a dark hood who tries to stab you with an oversized kitchen knife. Its some pretty disturbing stuff. But then the movie turns just plain silly as the crotchety townsfolk go on a literal witch hunt for anyone who seems different. Their cries of ""Heresy Burn her"" call to mind a high-school production of ""The Crucible."" And the protracted climax features cacophonous organ music signaling the return of a demon child who rises from the fires of hell to take revenge on her persecutors. Hovering above them she finds elaborate ways to torture them with razor wire and the blood sprays in all directions like something youd see in front of the Bellagio in Las Vegas. For a while though the film from French director Christophe Gans (""Brotherhood of the Wolf"") which he wrote with Roger Avary and Nicolas Boukhrief is compelling in a nightmarish way; the scares come in flashes in pieces that initially dont make sense. Mitchells Rose Da Silva crashes her car on the way to Silent Hill and ends up in what seems like an ash-covered war-torn version of the abandoned town; its almost like a parallel universe. Daughter Sharon has run off and Rose scurries around trying to find her among the towns dilapidated buildings. Sharon had been walking in her sleep screaming about Silent Hill a place to which she seems to have had some connection before her parents adopted her. Hence the road trip. Meanwhile Roses husband Chris (Sean Bean from ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy) hunts for them in the real Silent Hill a sun-splashed place where hes accompanied by a suspicious police detective (Kim Coates). He knows Rose is there somewhere but he keeps missing her like that episode of ""The Twilight Zone"" where the little girl goes through a hole in her bedroom wall and ends up in the fourth dimension. Now that was creepy from start to finish -- and it only took a half-hour. (c) 2013 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed.

The sorry track record for vidgame-to-bigscreen translations goes unchallenged by ""Silent Hill"" though above-average interest is generated for a time by ""Brotherhood of the Wolf"" helmer Christophe Gans elaborate visual package. Alas that interest deteriorates as story comes into focus with scares decreasing and scattered unintentional laughs increasing during pics long runtime. Gamers and horror fans pushed pic to a 20 mil opening and word-of-mouth is unlikely to prevent a sharp B.O. falloff. Unlike ""Brotherhood"" Canadian-French co-prod probably wont do significantly better abroad than in North America though worldwide ancillary prospects are solid. The Konami game series has been a high-water mark among horror games its four entries to date lauded for striking artwork and chilling atmospherics rather than simple gory action. Gans film succeeds fairly well along those same lines for about half its length but with horror-fantasy films especially its the climactic reels that really count. While myriad elements will trigger deja vu for game fans Roger Avarys script revolves around an original character Rose (Radha Mitchell) her husband Christopher (Sean Bean) and their adopted child Sharon (Jodelle Ferland) who often sleepwalks screaming the titular locations name when found. After a particularly harrowing such episode Rose decides to find the West Virginia ghost town and try to jog loose whatever trauma Sharon may have suppressed since being abandoned as an infant. Silent Hill has been ""shut"" since 1974 when a charcoal fire -- thats still smoldering underground -- killed most of the inhabitants. The constant ""snow""-fall is in fact ash -- hence the road is sealed off to keep out curiosity seekers. Re-creating games imagery this grayish-black small town of empty streets semi-collapsed buildings and dank interiors is a triumph for production designer Carol Spier and collaborators. Knocked out in a car accident upon arrival Rose awakes to find Sharon missing. Initial panicked searching reveals something is very wrong here -- as when emergency sirens announce periodic reality-shifts into a subterranean world of Boschian grotesques devouring cockroaches and one nasty demon called Pyramid Head. Rose is pulled onward by elusive glimpses of a child who may or may not be Sharon and is soon joined by local policewoman Cybil Bennett (Laurie Holden). Later they meet Anna (Tanya Allen) their entree to a group of religious fanatics led by Christabella (Alice Krige resembling Katharine Hepburn at her most Puritan-imperious). For Rose to rescue Sharon she must fight monsters and religious nutcases plus satisfy the vengeance needs of her daughters doppelganger. Storys climax makes the most vivid use of barbed wire since ""Suspiria"" but is too literal-minded and wordy after so much enigmatic buildup. In the end ""Silent Hill"" degenerates into an overblown replay of all those ""Twilight Zone"" and Stephen King stories in which outsiders stumble upon a time-warped location from which theres no escape. As Sharons evil twin Ferland has to deliver a late glut of garrulous explication (""I am the Reaper"") that no child thesp could pull off. A few minutes later Mitchell gets a big speech seemingly lifted from ""The Crucible"" and goes down for the count too. Indeed the situations here are so fantastical and extreme that Avarys dialogue often risks silliness. Bean and Kim Coates (as a police inspector) have thankless sidelined roles; Deborah Kara Unger in fright wig and Kabuki makeup is not much more favored. Despite earnest stabs at psychological depth not to mention pics impressive gore and design tropes final effect is negligible. Even more than in gaga genre hybrid ""Brotherhood of the Wolf"" Gans appears so engrossed by the opportunities for baroque style that he doesnt notice the creeping dearth of content. Tech contribs are first-rate down the line including those of myriad f/x companies. The occasional trip-hop beats of Jeff Dannas score however seem a tad incongruous; musique-concrete creepiness a la tomandandy (""The Hills Have Eyes"") would have better suited surreal timeless tenor.
