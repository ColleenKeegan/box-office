The Arthurian legend which has been retold countless times from Thomas Mallorys fifteenth-century epic poem Morte DArthur to Disneys 1963 animated movie The Sword in the Stone has no basis in historical fact whatsoever. The character of Arthur however is now a ready-made all-conquering medieval folk hero.Surprisingly producer Jerry Bruckheimer (Black Hawk Down Pirates of the Caribbean) and dir-ector Antoine Fuqua (Training Day) have ditched much of the familiar legend in favour of fresh historical claims for their Arthur (Clive Owen) who is the product - we are told during the opening credits - of spanking new but unrevealed archaeological evidence. The film discards the usual Arthurian mood of courtly romance and instead celebrates the nitty-gritty of the Dark Ages a time when the Roman army was withdrawing from Britain and Saxon warriors led by a cowboy-like Stellan Skarsgard were on the attack. Arthur himself is Romano-British and as such is experiencing a crisis of identity while leading his knights in defence of his homeland and wallowing in the inherited values of Rome (freedom being his familiar catchword).All this back story is a confusing over-long preamble to a series of quite exciting battles. Ultimately though Owen fails to muster enough charisma to carry the film and an impish Keira Knightley as Guinevere is a little red-undant despite the unfulfilled longing glances she exchanges repeatedly with Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd). A simpler story would have suited the bombastic Bruckheimer style.

No folks were not in Camelot anymore. Mostly were in and around Hadrians Wall in Britain at the dawn of the Dark Ages with the Romans in retreat the Saxons advancing and the severely downsized Knights of the Round Table defending civilization as they know it. Conditions in this world are not visibly much different from barbarism. Life on this frontier is rude and basic though Guinevere (Keira Knightley) does tidy herself up and slip into something pretty before getting it on with Arthur (Clive Owen). All poor Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd) gets however is a wistful peek through the window at Guinevere in dishabille and early death on the battlefield. A title card says this King Arthur grimly directed by Antoine Fuqua (Training Day) is based on the latest research into the mythic past. Maybe so. But one cant help thinking the research that really counted was that into the more recent box-office charts. Hmm look at those grosses for The Lord of the Rings. Must be some other old stuff we could turn into some sort of spectacle. So clang clang clang go the broadswords swish swish swish go the flights of arrows and twitch twitch twitch go our bottoms in the seats. Theres too much realism not enough magic in historical romance these days. What these movies really need are cheeky athletes as their heroes not actors lugubriously acting. They also need villains briskly spewing sardonic menace instead of grunting incomprehensibly. Above all they need flash sass and genial trash.

Once the sound of thundering hooves and New Age Celtic keening by Moya Brennan faded from my ringing ears I was left more satisfied than not with this exercise in historical speculation courtesy of director Antoine ""Training Day"" Fuqua and producer Jerry ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" Bruckheimer. It is as you might expect from that pair epic. Considering its worn-out cinematic precedents it is also epically fresh. <a href=""http//ad.doubleclick.net/jump/wpni.artsandlivingarticle/movies/reviews;dir=reviewsnode;dir=artsandliving;dir=movies;dir=reviews;page=article;kw=;ad=ss;ad=bb;pos=ad26;sz=300x250;tile=20;abr=ie;ord=1089361232081?""></a> <a href=""http//ad.doubleclick.net/jump/wpni.artsandlivingarticle/movies/reviews;dir=reviewsnode;dir=artsandliving;dir=movies;dir=reviews;page=article;kw=;ad=ss;ad=bb;pos=ad27;sz=160x600;tile=20;abr=ie;ord=1089361232081?""></a> <a href=""http//ad.doubleclick.net/jump/wpni.artsandlivingarticle/movies/reviews;dir=reviewsnode;dir=artsandliving;dir=movies;dir=reviews;page=article;kw=;ad=hp;pos=ad24;sz=336x850;tile=20;abr=ie;ord=1089361232081?""></a> Of course to anyone who has sat through any portion of the recent ""LOTR"" cycle much of ""King Arthur"" -- set in 5th-century Britain -- will feel familiar. As the members of ""King Arthurs"" outnumbered Roman-led contingent of foreign conscripts do battle against and sometimes with a confusing swirl of barbaric Saxons tattooed Picts and imperial Romans youll be forgiven if you hear echoes of Tolkiens multinational (not to mention multi-species) clash of elves dwarves humans Orcs and Ents. The correspondence between films is far from exact -- the Pictish seer-warrior Merlin (Stephen Dillane) is a far cry from the wizard Gandalf for instance -- but ""King Arthurs"" good-vs.-evil saga about a band of underdogs overcoming incredible odds is clearly indebted to the structure and themes of Peter Jacksons film trilogy. Of course much of ""King Arthur"" written by David ""Gladiator"" Franzoni is based on the archaeological and written record while Ive been told that ""LOTR"" was largely made up. No matter. You will be pleased to note that Franzoni retains from the Arthurian tales that most of us grew up with . . . a round table. Otherwise almost everything else here is new. Lucius Artorius Castus for instance aka Arthur (Clive Owen showing more animation than he has in a long while) is the half-Roman half-British commander of a cavalry unit of Sarmatian knights drafted from Eastern Europe by the Romans. Nearing the end of their 15-year-long tours of duty guarding a remote outpost along Hadrians Wall the 73-mile-long barricade built in the 2nd century to separate Roman-controlled Britain from Northern invaders like the Saxons Arthurs crew consists of Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd) Galahad (Hugh Dancy) Gawain (Joel Edgerton) Tristan (Mads Mikkelsen) Bors (Ray Winstone) and Dagonet (Ray Stevenson). When theyre not drinking and carousing with women much of their time is spent fending off attacks from the Picts north of the wall derisively called ""Woads"" by Arthur and his men because of their habit of decorating their skin with blue dye from the woad plant. (Time to bone up on that graduate-level seminar you took on ancient culture because much of this info comes rushing past with the speed of a flaming arrow.) The Saxons meanwhile led by the very scary-looking father-and-son team of Cerdic and Cynric (Stellan Skarsgard and Til Schweiger) have been lately making inroads from Northern Germany into Britain and now are threatening the son of a prominent Roman family cut off deep in Woad country far north of the wall. From the Roman Bishop Germanius (Ivano Marescotti) comes one last mission for Arthurs men Rescue the boy (Lorenzo De Angelis) and his family and only then can the knights collect their walking papers and go home. Have I mentioned that our seven heroes are outnumbered by oh about a thousand to one? Hey no biggie. Using brawn brains and a strategic alliance with the guerrilla-war-expert Picts negotiated by Merlins babelicious daughter Guinevere (Keira Knightley) who hates the Saxons as much as Arthur the knights handily defeat all comers. Well not quite handily. Some press photos have already given away the fact that someone working for the cause of truth justice and the Arthurian way gets killed. Just dont expect me to be the one to tell who. Is ""King Arthur"" a tall tale? Heck yes as tall as they come. But it should get bonus points in anyones book for a couple of things. First it doesnt dumb down too terribly a terribly complicated period in history. Second there is no Holy Grail motivating Arthurs men just a very human homesickness. Whats more Arthur himself is shown to be a Pelagian a once-discredited early Christian sect that believed in free will over divine grace. In other words by going back to its origins and dusting itself off the King Arthur story has proved itself to have a very contemporary resonance.

"King Arthur knight falls. Slate Sign In Sign Up King Arthur knight falls. King Arthur knight falls. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 7 2004 650 PM Arthur On the Rocks The once and future king in his dreariest picture yet. By David Edelstein Woad trip Forget Camelot. Forget Merlin the wizard and the Sword in the Stone. Forget the Lady of the Lake Morgan le Fay and Guinevere getting moist over Robert Goulet. Forget all the fancy fairy tales that have come down to us from Malory Tennyson T.H. White Lerner and Lowe John Boorman and Monty Python. ""Historians agree that recently discovered archeological evidence sheds light on [Arthurs] real identity"" proclaims the prologue to the new action-packed King Arthur (Touchstone) directed by Antoine Fuqua. As a nonhistorian who hasnt kept up with the latest archeological finds but who still likes to go around singing ""I wonder what the king/ is doing tonight/ What merriment is the king/ pursuing tonight"" I could hardly wait to meet the authentic once and future king. I wondered what the king was doing that night. Lopping off the limbs of insurgents apparently. This verisimilitudinous Arthur (played by Clive Owen) is a battle-hardened warrior at the northernmost outpost of the Roman Empire circa 452 A.D. not a king as yet but a king in spirit sort of like Nat ""King"" Cole. He is a Briton but he commands a Sarmatian cavalry for the occupying country. He likes the Romans. He fights against his own people because he considers Rome the fount of democracy religious tolerance and the credo that men (and women) control their own destinies. Given the bloody repression practiced by Rome at the time this is moronic but Arthur is not presented as a moron merely a soldier who is a tad out of touch--as much of a bleeding-heart liberal-humanist as a man who has lopped off thousands of insurgents limbs can be. Arthur goes where his superiors tell him to go and fights with manly honor mostly against native guerrilla units of ""Woads"" led by one Merlin (Stephen Dillane). His principal allegiance is to the soldiers conscripted to serve under him--a bunch of party animals with names like Lancelot Gawain Galahad and Tristan. Advertisement This is all pretty revisionist no court no jousts no chivalry no religiosity. No Holy Grail for that matter since no one in Arthurs squadron has a use for those sadistic Christians whod torture you as soon as look at you. Just good old-fashioned fightin and whoopin A wild bunch. Apt to grouse about their orders but carry them out anyway with uncommon valor. These could be any soldiers anywhere. They could even be the soldiers in Fuquas last picture Tears of the Sun (2003) which was also about a manly follower of orders (Bruce Willis) whose liberal-humanist conscience gets the better of him. Like Willis Arthur finds himself in conflict for the first time with the military brass. On the day that his men are supposed to be given their freedom to leave the rainy backward island and return to the sunshiney land of gladiators and Christian zealots a bishop with a ratlike countenance orders Arthur to embark on one last (suicide) mission beyond Hadrians Wall into the land of Scots Woads and invading barbarian Saxons. A Roman family favored by the pope is under siege by Injuns--I mean Saxons. Although Arthur is supposed to protect only this noble Roman family he knows that ""Saxons only claim what they kill"" and decides he cant leave the Scottish peasants--men women and kids--behind. As the soldiers in Tears of the Sun put it its a mission ""for his sins."" Arthur even joins forces with Merlins Woads including a hotcha Woad who looks like Winona Ryder stretched out (Keira Knightley) whom Arthurs men liberated from the dungeon of a fanatical Roman. ""He tortured me"" she says. ""With machines."" Then she adds ""Im Guinevere."" Thats some revision At first too weak to talk Guinevere is soon lecturing Arthur nonstop in perfect Oxbridge know-it-all diction about his habit of killing his own people whereupon I thought about torturing her with machines myself. But its hard to hate her too much when she wriggles into a fetching halter paints herself green and picks up a bow and arrow determinedly setting that long fish jaw. You go you saucy Woaden wench I did not know much about Saxons until now. Apparently they were heavy-metal RoadWarrior types with exceptional hearing. I infer the latter trait because their leader Cerdic played by Stellan Skarsgard does a lot of hoarse Methody mumbling in between long pauses in which he paces randomly and stares at the dirt. ""Arthur Who is this Arthur?"" he rasps inserting the thorn into his own side before Arthur has actually done anything to provoke him. Its difficult to see how the Saxons got anywhere in Briton on the basis of their fighting in this movie. In one scene they allow themselves to be lured onto thin ice by soldiers doing a lot of stomping and pointing their crossbows down. Oops. In another Arthur opens a door in Hadrians Wall and a bunch of Saxons obligingly rush in and get turned into pincushions. King Arthur is profoundly stupid and inept but its an endless source of giggles once you realize that its historical revisionism has nothing to do with archeological discoveries and everything to do with the fact that no one at Disney would green-light an old-fashioned talky love triangle with a hero who dies and an adulterous heroine who ends up in a nunnery. Not at these prices. Its too bad the big battle scenes are so confusingly staged and that they appear to have been denuded of splatter for a PG-13 rating Splatter would help. So would a Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd) who isnt a cipher given to intoning thesis lines like ""Arthur you fight for a world that no longer exists"" But Mads Mikkelsen has a great face for Tristan and Ray Winstone brings some Cockney bully-boy force to another of Arthurs men. And then theres Clive Owen rising above it all. Aloof yet watchful the actor cultivates an inner stillness that is perfect for faintly ironic brooders. He neither distances himself from this risible material nor pulls out the stops and opens himself to ridicule. His King Arthur tells us little about Arthur but much about protecting ones flank. The mark of a box-office king? David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air.

No sissy daydream of Camelot love triangles and the seeds of democracy for these two -- theyre after a real hero as red in tooth and claw if not quite as blue of face as Mel Gibsons William Wallace. So they dug around in the dumpster of British history to the Dark Ages an era surely optioned by God for the exclusive use of action directors. And lo They came upon a live one a fifth-century warrior named Lucius Artorius Castus (Arthur to you) a half-Roman half-Briton warrior who shilled for the declining Roman Empire in the far-flung outpost of England and who thought nothing of killing scores of his fellow Angles before destiny overtook him. Fuqua has given Arthur a round table -- an attractive item with a hole in the middle to accommodate a heating system -- thats rather too big for his six samurai er knights (soon to be seven when a woman joins the pack) who drape themselves around it like half a board meeting trying to look like a quorum. Still dont be misled by the chain mail and pre-medieval diction King Arthur is fundamentally a remake of The Wild Bunch with a goofy feminist bonus. Though Arthur is played by British actor Clive Owen he has a flinty eye and a mans-gotta-do set to his carved lips -- hes an all-American Arthur for the ages crying freedom while clobbering anyone who gets in his way. The action unfolds in England (Ireland actually but itll do fine) a green and unpleasant land where the snowblowers go full blast mist rises to all occasions and drenching rain brings more misery than barbarians at the gate ever could. As the movie opens Arthur and his men -- played by a pack of talented Brits that includes the fetching Ioan Gruffudd as a smoldering Lancelot and Ray Winstone as Bors a brawling family man -- have been playing cop for the Romans for 15 years and are now looking forward to a bit of peace and quiet. Their hopes are dashed when Rome sends out orders for the inevitable final mission which strands them and the bedraggled locals theyve rescued (among them Guinevere daughter of Merlin retooled as a violet-faced guerrilla) smack in the path of a vast army of hostile Saxons with blond braids hanging from their chins led by Stellan Skarsgard whose idea of a military strategy is ""Burn all the villages kill everyone."" Though the movies first full-court battle scene plays out on a sheet of fragile ice that divides the Saxons and the knights David Franzonis fried hybrid of a screenplay often makes it seem as though the real struggle is a linguistic face-off between the Cockneys (""Wo a bloody mess"" bellows Winstone like a demented soccer hooligan surveying the remains the of the stadium) and the neo-biblicals (""What tomorrow brings we cannot know"" sighs Arthur with the dignity of one destined for movie greatness). Will the knights return to help Arthur achieve new heights once their mission is completed and Rome has granted them their discharge papers? Ay marry they will for theres one last round of hand-held combat to be fought and its a total blast all breastplates machetes and other period-correct weaponry and flocks of flaming arrows overhead -- the most accurate of which are shot by Guinevere herself. Theres precious little chivalry here and precious little needed. Far from the coy flirt of most Arthurian fantasy this Guinevere is a killing machine whos more comfortable attired in indigo paint and a chain-mail bra than in damask and wimple. Never mind that the filmmakers have Guinevere confused with Boadicea the woad-covered woman warrior of fledgling Britain who is the subject of no less than four upcoming movies. The young Keira Knightley a dead ringer for Winona Ryder has yet to convince me she can act -- Pirates of the Caribbean doesnt count and she was adorably awful in the television adaptation of Doctor Zhivago. As Guinevere at least shes a sight to behold charging into the fray spearing and garroting as she goes and all this but a day after nipping uninvited into Arthurs tent in her undies and wiping the virginal look off his face with a little offscreen nookie. For all I know Franzonis version of the story historically speaking may be as much a load of old bollocks as all that Excalibur guff. But if King Arthur is as magnificently ridiculous as any Bruckheimer picture its thuggish charms which owe as much to Monty Python as to Sam Peckinpah more than pick up the slack.

Just ask Jerry Bruckheimer. 1 / 2 Back to Gallery King Arthur Drama. Starring Clive Owen Ioan Gruffudd and Keira Knightley. Directed by Antoine Fuqua. (PG-13. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""King Arthur"" is an attempt to tell the real story behind the Arthurian legend and if this is the truth give me Lerner and Lowe. Ten minutes of this overearnest mix of anachronism and dreariness and even the idea of Robert Goulet singing ""If Ever I Should Leave You"" sounds appealing. They didnt call these the Dark Ages for nothing. The film was written by David Franzoni who wrote ""Gladiator"" a film that showed its possible to invest a History Channel-type topic with dramatic urgency without compromising its historical interest or integrity. But in ""King Arthur"" everything goes wrong. The film combines the plodding sincerity of a Ph.D. dissertation with the brains of a high-concept Jerry Bruckheimer- produced blockbuster (which it is) and no one benefits. Jarring notes of comic relief and ridiculous faux feminism are thrown into a fifth century soup pot to make thick stinking gruel. Its not an appetizing picture. The true story of Britains King Arthur if there ever really was such a fellow has been a subject for historical speculation for centuries. ""King Arthur"" advances one theory. Here Arthur is Lucius Artorius Castus (Clive Owen) an Eastern European man impressed into Roman service as a boy and sent to police the British Isles as a Roman knight. With a group of other knights - - including Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd) Gawain (Joel Edgerton) Galahad (Hugh Dancy) and Bors (Ray Winstone) -- he fights off local freedom fighters such as the Celts a semi-savage warrior tribe led by Merlin (Stephen Dillane). ""King Arthur"" picks up the story in the year 452. Arthur and his men are at the end of their 15-year tour of duty and are looking forward to a peaceful retirement in Rome. They are weary and jaded -- and thats how they start the movie. Wait until they find out they have to complete one last mission in Britain to rescue some Romans who are about to be wiped out by Saxon hordes. There are few things more enervating than watching weary jaded people get more weary and jaded over two hours of screen time but this is the dilemma Franzoni and director Antoine Fuqua (""Training Day"") faced when they took on this subject. The knights have nothing to believe in. They dont believe in the cause theyre fighting for and they dont believe in the Roman Empire which is decadent and doomed. I suppose the filmmakers were hoping the audience would believe in Arthur and his men but -- aside from Bors who has a certain macho Curly Howard quality -- theyre a band of interchangeable mopes with a bad history steeped in gore up to their elbows. And that goes for Arthur too. Understandably then an effort was put into making Guinevere into a live wire but too much effort. The daughter of Merlin Guinevere is a warrior princess a feral little pagan mama who starts giving Arthur come-hither looks within minutes of being rescued from a Roman dungeon. She may be covered in her own filth but shes a confident modern young woman. Keira Knightley attacks the role of Guinevere with all the energy and enthusiasm of an actress convinced shes making an important feminist statement but if this is what feminism has become in the popular imagination its as depressing as this movies gray and white color palette. By turns insolent lustful or homicidal driven only by anger aggression or blood lust Guinevere is a woman with no inner life. If she were a man anyone in the audience easily would identify her as a sociopath. At least the action scenes might have been something but theyre routine -- except for one interesting battle over a not-so frozen lake. Even then Fuqua blows it by reverting to the usual shaky-camera-and-quick-cuts style of action filming which mistakes creating confusion for creating excitement. The one bright spot is Stellan Skarsgard as the hairy helmeted Saxon leader a mumbling barbarian who rarely speaks above a whisper and never says anything nice. Even in this misfired drama when he murmurs ""Burn every village kill everybody"" its scary. -- Advisory Dark Ages violence with swords spears arrows.

Nope were not in Middle-earth anymore; this is Antoine Fuquas ""King Arthur"" a Dark Ages action drama that nonetheless bears much resemblance to a trilogy blockbuster we all know. (Theres even a ring that figures in the plot -- and I dont mean the Round Table.) Unfortunately ""King Arthur"" is somewhat less compelling than the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies; theres serious intent here but an often thudding execution. Fuqua (""Training Day"" ""Tears of the Sun"") and screenwriter David Franzoni have scrapped the usual Middle Ages setting of movie Arthurian depictions for an earlier grimmer time; early title cards place us in fifth-century Britain with a reminder that ""archeological evidence"" indicates that this is the time when Arthur actually lived. Nothing wrong with trying something different but were certainly a long way from ""Camelot"" here. Clive Owen (strangely thick-voiced as if hes channeling Nicolas Cage) plays the unhappy hero; hes a manly brooding fellow with a constant thatch of Hollywood two-day stubble. (The facial hair in this movie it should be noted is diverse and creative particularly among the Saxon army made up of extras seemingly chosen for their resemblance to members of Metallica.) Arthur only wants to return home to Rome (in this version hes a Roman warrior) but he and the knights of his Round Table first must rescue an endangered Roman nobleman (Ken Stott) and bring him and his household to safety all the while facing the inevitable arrival of the marauding Saxons. Along the way they rescue the fair Guinevere (Keira Knightley) have a brief encounter with the blue-lipped wizard Merlin (Stephen Dillane) endure a picturesque snowstorm and triumph in an effective battle scene staged on a frozen lake before the films chaotic final battle. Some of this is nicely done particularly that icy face-off on the lake which features some showy under-the-ice shots and a palpable sense of menace. But the characters are mostly too morose to register with few exceptions. Ray Winstone with his big blocky head brings a cackling lightness to his role as Round Table warrior Bors. Movie review Showtimes and trailer  With Clive Owen Ioan Gruffudd Keira Knightley Stellan Skarsgard Hugh Dancy Ray Winstone Stephen Dillane. Directed by Antoine Fuqua from a screenplay by David Franzoni. 130 minutes. Rated PG-13 for intense battle sequences a scene of sensuality and some language. Several theaters. Knightley -- who doesnt even show up until halfway through the film -- stands out by virtue of being the only woman on screen but the filmmakers seem a little mystified by her. This Guinevere is herself a warrior but a rather odd one in a vaguely S amp; M-ish costume made up of a very few tight leather straps (it looks hellishly uncomfortable which is perhaps why shes always yelling when she wears it) she joins the men on the battlefield jumping on enemies and seemingly attempting to bite them. (While shes in calendar-girl garb the men are safely encased in chain mail and armor.) Owen is a fine subtle actor (see ""Croupier"" or ""Gosford Park"" for a better demonstration of his cool appeal) but hes a bit lost here in a film that places action and noise above character. And those well-known characters are part of the movies biggest problem. Fuquas film purports to give a more historically accurate take on the popular Arthurian legend; thats all very well but we already know these names in another context. And within the new films occasionally sloppy storytelling we start filling in the blanks using our knowledge of the previous stories -- and the result is confusion. Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd) is introduced as if hes a major character but he actually has little to do. If he were named say Fred this wouldnt be a problem; but as it is we keep waiting for plot points that never develop. And drop-in characters like Merlin are simply mystifying -- if we didnt already know he was a wizard we might conclude that he was just a wacko. Despite its problems ""King Arthur"" has its moments. Slawomir Idziaks cinematography is sweeping and occasionally lovely and the brooding Owen in a different movie would make a splendid romantic hero. The movies likely arent through with the Knights of the Round Table; a better movie about them will come along another day.

Well leave it to the producer who helped dream up Johnny Depp as a pirate to order a round tables worth of pizzas. Her knight in shining armor Keira Knightley as Guinevere and Clive Owen as King Arthur. Buena Vista Pictures For better or worse but surely satisfying novelty needs Jerry Bruckheimers King Arthur (  1/2 out of four) is set much earlier than usual and against the crumbling Roman Empire which may even (or not) be historically legitimate. In any event were in a new screen era when a smarmy Italian bishop feeds Arthur (Clive Owen) a line you dont often hear in these movies ""The pope has taken a special interest in you."" (Related video Watch a clip from King Arthur) As subservient Brits Arthurs remaining men have survived 15 years of combat attrition and are rockin to wench. But no. A stranded Roman family is about to be pillaged by scruffy Saxons necessitating a rescue. And you can imagine Arthurs irk when he comes to find that the clans chief rescue target isnt remotely worthy of the effort -- even if one torture victim he discovers in an adjacent dungeon is (Keira Knightleys Guinevere). Theres a built-in dilemma for anyone who tries to assign merit or non to this high-priced throwaway The sillier it gets the more mild fun it becomes (even if you dont respect yourself the next morning). Guineveres cramped-cell time has so gnarled her fingers that their joints look ready for witchs casting if and whenever Bruckheimer decides to film Hansel and Gretel. Yet let Arthur give them a few well-placed pulls and twists and here she is a reel or two later hitting bulls-eye Saxon targets with precision bending that bow like Beckham. Owen Knightley and Stellan Skarsgaard (who better as a goldilocked Saxon heavy?) all do more for the movies same old flaming weaponry than the weaponry does for them. Theres a Lancelot here too -- Ioan Gruffudd an anti-marquee moniker if ever there was one -- but the traditional romantic triangle isnt much of a factor. The movie never seems to quite know whats on its mind though individual scenes (a cool battle on the ice) have their moments. The director is Antoine Fuqua of Training Day which at times describes his epic-fashioning chores here. (Opens nationwide today.

"King Arthur A Myth of Steel Not Sugar washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living >> Follow Style On Movies King Arthur A Myth of Steel Not Sugar Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Wednesday July 7 2004 It may be worth nine bucks to see the great young British actress Keira Knightley as a kill-crazed blood-drenched pagan Tinker Bell a pixie sprite with a battle ax chopping and hewing left and right. She bends it like Beckham with several pounds of cold steel and you think Hmmm thats a young lady with spunk But if Knightleys warrior Guinevere is absolutely the best thing in ""King Arthur"" its not the only delight. The film boasts all the hallmarks of the 50s historic epic save the presence of Tony Curtis battles galore tons of rolling mist standing for the vapors of myth cool castles gross Germanic villains nobility sacrifice mud sweat tears and death with less gore than one might expect as the movie has been engineered to a PG-13 rating. And the film has a gimmick. This isnt your fathers Knights of the Round Table song resung for the umpteenth time but a whole new tack into the material. The conceit is to locate the authentic Arthur not the Lerner-Loewe Welshman yakkety-yakking ""Camelot"" to Julie Andrews amid the sunlight of a suspiciously over-illuminated Dark Ages. No Lancelot-Arthur-Guin triangle no sword in stone no Merlin the Magician no Mordred the bad boy. Instead the production is located in the 500s when a crumbling shrinking Roman empire is retreating from its farthest flung outposts leaving chaos and carnage in its wake. One of the farthest flung of those outposts is Hadrians Wall separating Roman Britannia from pagan Britannia. There a noble Romano-Brit officer named Arthur (Clive Owen kingly and powerful) attempts to deal with the coming madness made all the more threatening by the approach of yet a third antagonist the forces of Saxony blond brutish invaders from Germany who threaten to overcome the island and turn it er Anglo-Saxon. So one point the movie makes almost incidentally is that nobody comes from where they are and that everybody comes from somewhere else. Many of us are slavish admirers of whats called Anglo-Saxon culture as if it were the indigenous culture of Britain and the West but it wasnt. The Saxons were just another earlier wave of invaders and like all invaders their weapons were terror and rape. Stellan Skarsgard playing the Saxon king Cerdic looks like Yosemite Sam with a serious case of constipation. Anyhow in the fight to repel the invaders Arthur has his knights. But Lancelot Gawain Tristan and so forth are not fair-haired Etonians in search of Christian purity. They are Sarmatians -- that is Central European mercenaries who have been compelled by the Romans to put in 15 years service. Their enlistment is about up and a return to the steppes is haunting their imaginations as is the pleasure of at last giving up the perpetual state of war in Britannia in which theyve lived. In the language of todays army theyre short. In other words the movie offers what might be called the Arthurian Ur-text a vision of the original reality now long-forgot and all but irrecoverable that was later gilded by more romantic tellers from other times and traditions until it became so glamorized it had lost all contact with the harsh brutality of the real. Thats the theory. In practice ""King Arthur"" basically encompasses two stories somewhat awkwardly conjoined. The first is of a rescue mission that Arthur and his knights must partake even though all have been promised release from obligation to rescue a Roman nobleman living beyond Hadrians Wall and thought to be in danger. As always politics intrudes. The big shots in Rome dont care about this fellow but about his son a favorite of the pope (who at this time is more powerful than the emperor). This initial story almost feels like a reprise of director Antoine Fuquas last film the underrated ""Tears of the Sun"" in which a U.S. Navy SEAL team was inserted into a civil war (in Africa) to extract a vulnerable citizen. In ""King Arthur"" the knights are the SEALs of A.D. 550 elite warriors with highly refined combat skills. Its on that mission that they encounter the teenage Guinevere who has been captured by the Roman nobleman. Shes the daughter it turns out of the tribal leader Merlin a longtime antagonist of Arthur. But he sees that the pagans -- theyre called Woads here -- and the Romans can make common cause against the encroaching Saxons. And indeed it is thought that the one true Arthur did such a thing He unified Roman and Celtic troops and faced the Saxons 12 times finally at the Battle of Badon Hill where he turned them back and won for ""civilized"" Britain a 40-year respite which might be seen as the antecedent of the storied peace and justice of Camelot however brief it was. In any event as Fuqua tells the tale the second half of the film is much stronger. Arthur must put away his blood enmity with the Woads and form an alliance with them to fight the Saxons even as the perfidious Romans (personified by a smarmy bishop) are fleeing for their lives. As he has proved many a time Fuqua is a superb action director and he always finds an unseen spectacle around which to build his big action set pieces. One recalls the famous Battle on the Ice of Sergei Eisensteins ""Alexander Nevsky"" as the knights -- plus Guinevere a gifted archer -- face a mass of Teutons charging across a frozen river. Im as sick of computer imagery as you are but the legerdemain by which the ice cracks and sends the proto-Nazis to a cold watery grave is masterful. The final fight pitches the fire and strength of the combined Arthurian-Woad alliance against the Germanic throngs. Its beautifully filmed as the skies fill with fire arrows like SAMs rising against our jets over Baghdad in the recent fracas and the forces close and clash and the delicate Knightley goes all Samurai on her opponents while atop their horses the surviving knights function like M-1 tanks raking through the battlefield. You might fault the eternal cliche by which in the middle of thousands of fighters the two kings locate each other and settle their differences steel on steel as the minions around them cooperate by clearing a nice little free space. On the other hand you might as well just sit back and enjoy the fight. Fuqua has a real weakness for calendar art compositions and I would argue that this was kitsch except that I have the same loathsome weakness. So a lot of ""King Arthur"" is a kind of macho battle porn of posture weapon and uniform The knights are forever rearing up their steeds before charging pennants flapping behind them long swords drawn and glistening armor alight with the illumination of the battle fires all this in rapturous slo-mo all of it framed and romanticized even further by the ghostly layers of mist floating everywhere. If this is the sort of thing you like youre really going to like it here. I wish the film were technically -- oh whats the word? -- ""better."" We dont really get much sense of personality beyond archetype and for a movie that pretends to a higher realism its still plenty jammed up with macho bluster and romanticism. Guinevere and Arthur? Well not a love story for the ages as theyre both so busy slashing and bashing they dont have much time to relate. Knightley is probably too good an actress for this sort of thing though she makes a great battle faerie. Ioan Gruffudd who plays Lancelot the smartest and most loyal of the knights but also the most conflicted really doesnt feature in the workings of the story. Hes just there and more attention goes to the sexy beast Ray Winstone as someone named Bors more man-mountain than cavalry trooper who gets most of the best lines. King Arthur (125 minutes at area theaters) is PG-13 rated for intense battle scenes.

Impressively made and well acted. Brandishing a surprising seriousness of purpose for a would-be summer blockbuster ""King Arthur"" bracingly repositions the Arthurian myth in a specific and savage historical moment quite removed from its usual placement in a bucolic world of chivalrous knights a mischievous magician and an errant queen. Impressively made and well acted by an exceedingly attractive cast this dark tale of ceaseless conflict is adult entertainment and will likely disappoint viewers expecting a ""Camelot""-like love triangle as it will the fun-seeking youth audiences that made ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" a smash for Disney and producer Jerry Bruckheimer a year ago. As a result domestic B.O. will likely be closer to that of ""Braveheart"" which grossed only 76 million even with its Oscars than to the Bruckheimer norm. In line with most big-canvas action fare overseas should yield considerably higher returns. This Irish-British co-production without a single American in it feels more like a European film than a Hollywood venture. For original ""Gladiator"" writer David Franzoni script seems like another chapter in his own telling of the fall of the Roman Empire this time concentrating on the period in the fifth century (scarcely if ever depicted before in the cinema) when Rome faced with barbarian encroachments closer to home decided to call it a day in Britannia the island it had occupied since 60 A.D. For director Antoine Fuqua its another example of pushing what could have been standard genre material into unexpectedly gritty and stimulating realms. To kids and anyone else clueless about the period opening stretch will be a bit of a slog as confusingly positioned narration and compressed dialogue fight an uphill battle to explain how subdued Sarmatian warriors (from what is roughly Georgia today) were long before enlisted in the Roman army and sent to Britain to help maintain the peace in one of the empires most distant outposts. Descendants of these fighters now in 452 A.D. -- the time frame is curious in that Rome actually withdrew in 410 -- represent the inner circle of soldiers under the command of Lucius Artorius Castus a half-Roman half-Briton who the film using shreds of historical evidence plausibly argues might have served as the inspiration for the Arthur of legend. Thinking his work done and longing to return to his dream city after years of fighting guerrilla fighters from the north known as the Woads Artorius or Arthur (Clive Owen) is therefore dismayed to receive orders from a newly arrived bishop to take his men north to rescue a young Roman beloved by the Pope. Mission appears almost suicidal not only because it leads through Woad territory but because marauding Saxons are on the verge of sweeping into the territory. Romes dwindling status is neatly summed up in an early scene that reveals only six surviving soldiers other than the commander himself remaining to sit at Arthurs enormous round table. They are Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd) Arthurs closest friend but also most frequent critic; Bors (Ray Winstone) a boisterous bruiser with a huge brood of bastard kids and the less characterized Galahad (Hugh Dancy) Gawain (Joel Edgerton) Tristan (Mads Mikkelsen) and Dagonet (Ray Stevenson). With the promise that theyll finally be granted freedom upon their return this Wild Bunch or Magnificent Seven is quickly entrapped by the Woads led by the mysterious Merlin (Stephen Dillane all but unrecognizable in virtual Undead makeup). Just as quickly released they make their way to the remote villa of the aristocratic father of the teenager theyre meant to take home. Interlude that follows speaks volumes about the nature of the Roman occupation in Britain and the competing religious factions within the Christianized empire. In simple strokes production designer Dan Weil superbly sums up how Romans tried to precisely reproduce their native lifestyle wherever they settled. Script deftly introduces the element of the early churchs intolerance which represented a huge change from Romes centuries-long policy of allowing its conquered peoples to continue observing their own gods and traditions. But while these historical niceties will probably sail past most viewers this urgent sequence also serves to kick-start the narrative 45 minutes in. Among the prisoners found in the villas private dungeon is the ailing but feisty Guinevere (Keira Knightley) who despite her unwashed appearance strikes immediate sparks with Arthur. Productions great set piece shortly follows. With a splinter group of bloodthirsty Saxons in hot pursuit the Roman caravan which now includes the villas native serfs Arthur feels duty-bound to protect heads into the mountains through the snow and most precariously over a small frozen lake. Arthur entices the Saxons into battle as the mighty Dagonet hacks away at the ice until it splits open and swallows up dozens of barbarians. Some CGI work contributes to the exciting spectacle but as elsewhere in the picture its kept to a refreshing minimum enhancing the films sense of realism. (Entire ice battle sequence reportedly derives from an early Franzoni draft of ""Gladiator."") With the successful completion of Arthurs final official mission comes his conversion from Roman commander to British leader. Realizing his enemy is no longer Rome but the Saxons Merlin casts his lot with Arthur while Guinevere having shown herself to be a skilled archer advises Arthur that ""These are your people"" in the course of seducing him. Internally Arthur resigns himself to a British future after learning that Rome no longer embodies his overriding dream of free choice for all. For a contemporary action film that takes pains to deliver on a visceral level (pic decidedly skirts and arguably exceeds the normal bounds of PG-13 violence) all the sober moral and philosophical detailing gives weight to the title characters decision making. Arthur is not swayed by the emotional impact of injustice nearly as much as he is by the principles hes always lived by; when the guiding light emanating from Rome is compromised he has the strength of character to transfer his loyalties to a cause that definitely needs and might possibly justify his support. Well-structured picture naturally builds to a final fight based on the actual Battle of Badon Hill in which the Saxons were decisively turned back. In fictional terms its this victory that transforms the victor into King Arthur a man destined for hallowed status as a potential unifier of a divided land. As a version of who Arthur might have been if he existed at all this telling is as credible as any other. What the film does not offer however is the King Arthur of T.H. Whites ""The Once and Future King"" Lerner and Loewes ""Camelot"" or John Boormans ""Excalibur"" all exceptional works dedicated to the elaboration of myth and legend. Here the relationship between Arthur and Guinevere seems more expedient than romantic and there is just the barest hint of an illicit attraction between Guinevere and Lancelot. Owen is like a solid oak as Arthur rugged manly capable true to his word and to himself. Fuqua and lenser Slawomir Idziak most often shoot the actor at a three-quarters angle favoring his left side and the effect often calls to mind Richard Burton in his period roles. Post-""Croupier"" this role and performance shows Owen at his best and most charismatic. Even if Guinevere emerges as less central than is suggested by the advertising campaign Knightley has little trouble persuading one to accept the spirited future queen as an action heroine no matter how much this interpretation seems like a sop to modern tastes. Striding around in wispy gowns and skin-baring leather battle gear when the men are bundled up against the chill the striking young actress with darkened hair here rivets the attention whenever shes onscreen showing every sign of a real star in the making. With the adamantly pagan Lancelot cast as Arthurs intellectual adversary Gruffudd makes an OK but overly subdued impression. Standout supporting turn comes from Ray Winstone who makes Bors into a tempestuous force of nature. (Farrelly Brothers take note Almost to the point of distraction Winstone with his bulk buzz-cut and manic energy is a virtual dead-ringer here for Curly of the Three Stooges.) Also terrific is Stellan Skarsgard as the fearsome Saxon leader Cerdic bedecked with long blond locks and beard and Til Schweiger is a fine match as his less capable son. Fuquas direction fuses the tales physical and mental elements in muscular vigorous fashion largely without the bombast that is often part and parcel of this sort of picture. Dominant set is an impressive Roman fortress along Hadrians Wall Penny Roses costumes are nicely detailed and lushly rugged Irish locations are enshrouded in atmospheric fog smoke and snow. Idziaks lensing is dominated by blues blacks and earth tones. Composer Hans Zimmer has been down this road before giving the score an overly familiar sound especially with the impressionistic female vocal wailings.
