With Audrey Tautou Mathieu Kassovitz. Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet. In French with subtitles. Running time 120 mins. Rated R Sexual content. 2 1/2 Stars. A blockbuster hit in France Jean-Pierre Jeunets whimsical ""Amelie"" arrives in the U.S. on a tidal wave of good cheer and a boatload of expectations - not only for a lucrative run but as a contender for an Oscar. These expectations come partly from the history of its U.S. distributor Miramax Films. The savvy Disney-owned boutique has done well by such foreign-language movies as ""Il Postino"" and ""Life Is Beautiful."" ""Amelie"" has neither the sentiment nor the Oscar-currying humanism of those Italian films but Miramax also landed a Best Picture nomination for last years ""Chocolat"" and that English-language picture is ""Amelies"" spiritual twin. Both center on a woman who whips up romantic chemistry along with a little mischief for the French locals and is rewarded with her own romance along the way. The difference is in the telling. Where ""Chocolat"" director Lasse Hallstrom worked from a discreet distance Jeunets hipster presence is felt in every frame of ""Amelie."" It is a tour de force of a bauble if such a thing can exist. ""Amelie"" stars Audrey Tautou as a waitress in Paris colorful - and colorfully recreated - Montmartre. More of a cosmic spark than a realized person Amelie is zipping through life on the fringes of coincidence. (Her mother was killed next to her when they walked into the path of a falling suicide victim.) When she discovers a tin box filled with photos and toys placed under her bathroom tiles 40 years earlier by a young boy she tracks down the now middle-aged man to return his boyhood memories. Her do-goodism works like a drug on Amelie who now sets out to improve the lives of everyone around her even if it requires lies tricks and a few felonies. Jeunet who teamed with Mark Caro for the ingeniously twisted 1991 cannibalism comedy ""Delicatessen"" spends some quality time introducing Amelie from sperm to waitress and uses a variety of quirky flashbacks and fantasies to keep things hopping throughout. But whether youre charmed or bored by the movie depends entirely on your feelings for Amelie a young woman whose hyper-quirky personality both takes some getting used to and grows old fast.

Comments Amelie Rated R  121 minutes  2001 This 2001 feature by Jean-Pierre Jeunet was both loved and hated in its native France. Its the candy-colored whimsical tale of an introverted young woman (Audrey Tautou) who decides overnight to become the fairy godmother of her neighborhood. Her campaign is prompted by the discovery of a little boys treasure box which is what Jeunet seeks to reproduce--a sense of the world as a collection of fetishized objects that convey emotions and states of mind (literally in the case of the plaster lawn gnome Amelie steals from her fathers garden and sends on a round-the-world tour). The ease with which the perky big-eyed heroine succeeds in improving the lot of everyone around her and the painterly manner in which reality is ""improved"" constitute the films ""quirky"" charm and its pure fishiness. Jeunet has succeeded at drawing us inside his head; the question is do we want to be there? In French with subtitles.

More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> A few selection-committee snobs at film festivals in Cannes and New York wrote off Amelie as a fluff ball and foolishly shut it out of competition. The plot may be gossamer but no way is director Jean-Pierre Jeunet who co-wrote the script with Guillaume Laurant a slave to Hollywood formula. If you caught Jeunets Delicatessen a 1991 comedy about cannibalism or The City of Lost Children a 1995 fantasy about stolen dreams or even his flawed Hollywood film 1997s Alien Resurrection you already know the director is a thrilling visual stylist. With Jeunet you must expect the unexpected. Early in Amelie a suicide leaps from a building and lands on Amelies hapless mother killing her flat. No wonder Amelie is cautious about life. It doesnt help that her father a man obsessed with garden gnomes has misdiagnosed her with a weak heart. Amelie observes life at a distance that is until she finds of box of toys in her apartment and decides to find the owner - now a grown man. The owner is overjoyed and Amelie watching in secret begins her life as a mender of broken hearts. Nothing too goody-goody; she also sticks it to the wicked. More crucially she falls in love with a man Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz) who haunts photo booths to make art out of the discarded pictures. Nino is Amelies kind of guy though shes too shy to say hello. Only a spoilsport would give away Amelies secrets or the event that brings her and Nino together. But as Jeunet and the brilliant cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel spin the camera around Paris from Montmartre to Notre Dame its hard not to fall under the spell of this moonstruck romance.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet A whirling eager-to-please visually striking contraption Amelie opens with a fast-paced history of its eponymous Parisian heroines early years connecting each major development of her childhood to a matrix of coincidental imperceptibly connected events. A kind of localized piece of chaos theory with suicidal Newfoundlanders and other oddities taking the place of flapping butterflies Amelie presents a vision of the world that could have come from few directors other than Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Jeunet and erstwhile co-director Marc Caro first attracted widespread attention with Delicatessen and The City Of Lost Children both showcases for intricately choreographed displays of behind-the-camera bravado and clever production design that pleased the senses without engaging the brain or the emotions. (Jeunets subsequent solo effort Alien Resurrection displayed the same problems and then some.) Perhaps as a form of overcompensation Jeunet places a big beating heart at the center of Amelie in the form of Audrey Tautou a wide-eyed indefatigably good-natured young cafe worker who takes delight in attempting to improve other peoples lives while ignoring her own happiness. But even with such a pleasing presence Amelie runs into many of the same difficulties Jeunet faced in the past. For all her winsome smiles Tautou ends up embodying the emotional reserve of the directors films. Inspired by her successful reunion of a collection of childhood mementos with its middle-aged owner Tautou begins to work from a distance to bring happiness into the lives of those around her by subtly disrupting the flow of everyday life without directly involving herself in the action. In a sense shes the ultimate Jeunet heroine present but untouched by events around her. Even the films decision to pair her off with a similarly disposed young man seems to come from romantic convention not any other impulse. Its hard to shake the notion that Jeunet makes films primarily because he needs a place to collect his ideas. Amelie contains enough material for a dozen or so charming shorts but stretched to feature length the whimsy grows wearisome and the film delights far less than it seems to desire.

Updated July 29 2016  815 pm Full Forecast News Sports Business Photos Obits Buy amp; Sell Whimsical Amelie proves love conquers all CHRISTY LEMIRE The Associated Press Dec 28 2001 Amelies mother was killed by a tourist who hurled herself from the top of Notre Dame cathedral. Her closest childhood friend was a suicidal goldfish named Blubber. Small wonder that the adult Amelie nurses both a vivid fantasy life and a somewhat shy circumspect attitude toward love. ""Even artichokes have hearts"" the doe-eyed delightfully coy young woman (Audrey Tautou) is told and she has to discover hers too. The abiding optimism of ""Amelie"" has proven too much for some people who have derided Jean-Pierre Jeunets film -- a huge commercial success in France -- as the kind of feel-good fare that should remain the province of Hollywood. But one cant easily imagine mainstream Hollywood crafting such determinedly quirky and whimsical fare. In Jeunets lunatic landscape statues of people open their eyes while paintings and photographs talk. At one point Amelie herself melts down splashing into a puddle of water. Such cinematic self-consciousness -- theres a sort of ""look-ma no-hands"" exuberance to Jeunets work -- wont surprise filmgoers who saw ""Delicatessen"" the inventive 1991 movie about cannibalism that he co-directed with Marc Caro. (Since then Jeunet has directed ""Alien Resurrection."") But underlying the directorial derring-do is an enduring truth Love really can conquer all. The films narrative -- set around the time of Princess Dianas death in August 1997 -- is about getting Amelie to that realization which requires her to shift her focus away from the well-being of others toward her own bashful self. She helps her friends and neighbors through a series of clever secret gifts -- becoming the eyes of a blind man by describing in detail everything he would see during his stroll making a videotape of the Tour de France for an elderly man who never leaves his apartment playing matchmaker for the lonely tobacconist at the cafe where she works. Similarly she plays pranks on mean-spirited people -- notably the local grocer who verbally abuses his disabled employee -- but even her tricks have a sense of well-intentioned whimsy about them. Still shy Amelie never does anything to make herself happy and dines at home alone night after night. She eventually finds a soul mate in Nino Quincampoix (Mathieu Kassovitz) a part-time cashier at a sex shop who has to jump through hoops to gain any sort of response from her. He arrives at her cafe only to have her retreat behind a hastily scrawled ""menu du jour."" And when he shows up outside her apartment door she pretends shes not home. (The casting of Kassovitz represents a kind of Gallic in-joke insofar as the male lead in this paean to love directed the French film ""La Haine"" or ""Hate."") Its the way of such stories to lead to a final pairing-off which ""Amelie"" does in a conclusion as conventional as Jeunets filmmaking style is singularly eccentric. In the end for all of Jeunets cinematic tricks romance rules.

Jean-Pierre Jeunets fresh funny exquisitely bittersweet tour de force about a lass who makes sly incursions into the lives of her neighbors is ambitious yet intimate. If Paris were destroyed tomorrow and the recipe for true love lost archeologists could reconstruct both to perfection from just a reel of ""Amelie From Montmartre."" Jean-Pierre Jeunets fresh funny exquisitely bittersweet tour de force about a lass who makes sly incursions into the lives of her neighbors is ambitious yet intimate defiantly personal yet gleefully universal. Sold to most territories (including Miramax for the U.S.) on the basis of a four-minute sample reel delightful pic opens today in Gaul on the crest of the most ecstatic advance reviews and word-of-mouth for a French pic in recent memory. This years Cannes fest is to hold a special outdoor screening of the pic free to the public on the evening of May 13. Jeunets movie seems primed to establish a before-and-after vocabulary in much the same way ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" gave birth to the term ""Tarantino wannabe."" From now on any director who tries to distill the brash core of effective whimsy into one sublime package but doesnt quite hit the mark could be dubbed a ""Jeunet wannabe."" Theres also an additional cause for celebration. Twenty-three-year-old lead thesp Audrey Tautou -- the youngest cosmetician in Tonie Marshalls ""Venus Beauty Institute"" and the girl in Laurent Firodes ""The Beating of the Butterflys Wings"" last year -- is a delight to watch and root for as she makes creative adjustments to the lives of her Montmartre neighbors all of whom are played by character actors at one with their peculiar roles. Bulk of pic is set in a short period surrounding Princess Dianas fatal car crash in August 1997 but venture successfully cultivates a timeless quality. Jeunet and co-scripter Guillaume Laurant set the bar for visual and situational imaginativeness at Olympian heights but clear it with ease over and over again. Go out for popcorn and youre likely to miss enough quirky little touches to make at least one award-winning short. But the beauty of the films mechanism -- an accretion of rapid but perfectly observed wacky ingredients -- is that every poignant or silly little detail contributes to the story which seems to discover a twinkly new constellation in the annals of star-crossed lovers. The far-fetched circumstances of the upbringing of Amelie (Tautou) an only child are laid out in 10 minutes by an omniscient narrator (Andre Dussollier) with a buoyant series of vignettes. After her physician father mistakenly diagnosed a heart irregularity Amelie was educated at home. Her mother died young and as Amelie never had playmates she created a rich fantasy life. At adulthood Amelie settles in the Montmartre district of Paris and waitresses in an old-fashioned cafe with an idiosyncratic staff and regulars. These include owner Suzanne (Claire Maurier) whose theory about surreptitiously provoking surefire romance is tested by Amelie on two unlikely candidates Georgette (Isabelle Nanty) a tic-laden hypochondriac who mans the tobacco counter and Joseph (Jeunet regular Dominique Pinon) a jealous borderline malevolent customer who chronically pops the plastic on bubble wrap. Neighbors of note include a painter Dufayel (Serge Merlin) who lives in a padded apartment as his bones are so fragile they snap at the slightest pressure. His groceries are delivered by Lucien (Jamel Debbouze) a pleasant lad whos harassed by his boss Collignon (Urbain Cancellier). When Amelie discovers a tin box of boyhood treasures concealed in her bathroom wall she decides to track down the now-grown owner and anonymously return the knickknacks. The result convinces her she can change lives with a few judicious tweaks to the environments of those around her. Whether pranks (to impart a lesson) or creative social work (to boost morale) Amelies adjustments to reality are wildly entertaining. She pulls a mercilessly funny stunt on her father (Rufus) and initiates a superb development in the dreary life of her buildings long-suffering concierge (Yolande Moreau). But her toughest case concerns Nino Quincampoix (Mathieu Kassovitz a helmer in his own right) who makes the rounds of the citys coin-operated photo booths collecting discarded ID photos. Jeunet who co-crafted ""Delicatessen"" and ""The City of Lost Children"" with Marc Caro before helming the 1997 ""Alien Resurrection"" has always opted for the total control a studio setting affords. Here however he ventures out into the real Paris working with his crack effects specialists to coax every micron of latent charm from some 80 Paris locations. From the tchotchke-fied studio of Amelies concierge to the digitally assisted cloud formations overhead every frame is an instant lesson in architecture or design as a reflection of character -- of a city as well as of the people in it. Even the most casual viewers will feel as if theyve borrowed an artists eyes for two hours. The lugubrious quality of Jeunets previous work is gone but an agreeably heart-tugging melancholy remains. Traces of the joyous gravity perfected long ago by composer Erik Satie are alive and well in Yann Tiersens lilting score.

The line and the outrage behind it were both funny intentionally or not but they also said something about the character of the nostalgia to which the writer and the magazine were stubbornly beholden. Rafferty was writing in the pre-Tina Brown New Yorker in which questions of good taste and high standards were still serious matters in measure because they were also the last defense against the irresistible trends to which The New Yorker would soon succumb. One of the shocks that Brown inflicted on the magazine was that pop culture -- the low brow of the masses vs. their middle brow -- had to be taken with the same seriousness as the culture of the brownstone Brahmins. That wouldnt have been a calamity except that the obligation wasnt simply to seriousness but to reverence. Higher cultures inherent snobberies allow critics not simply to love and hate freely but to think about the gray area in between; pop culture demands love and only love hate and only hate. In this tyranny of absolutism one born more out of the free market than any postmodern imperative the dissenting critic risks being labeled an elitist or worse yet irrelevant which is often just a code for ""too old."" A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Which is a roundabout way of saying that the new French film Amelie sucks. Not because the film was a monster hit in France and looks to be one here though perhaps of more modest art-house proportions but because its a frenetic bore that insists on its audiences adoration while making no demands upon their intelligence. The story is simplicity itself Amelie (Audrey Tautou) a waitress lives in a strangely depopulated deracinated Montmartre and longs for love. A waif with bobbed hair and pooling eyes Amelie looks like a silent-movie heroine and for two tiring hours exercises an emotional range redolent of those primitive early entertainments-- she smiles at the camera widens her eyes crinkles her mouth. Because the films director Jean-Pierre Jeunet is more of a watchmaker than a poet of the heart and soul however there is no mystery to how she finds love only a series of intricately choreographed Rube Goldberg-like set pieces in which Amelie flips the switch. This is too bad not only because Tautou can actually act (shes charming when shes not twinkling as she goes in for the kill) but because she was Jeunets best chance to take the chill off his film to modulate his relentless technical virtuosity with the pulse of real life.Along with Marc Caro Jeunet made the wind-up movies Delicatessen and City of Lost Children then flew -- and crashed -- solo in the United States with the thuddingly dull Alien Resurrection. Delicatessen was promising but warned of a sensibility too in love with its own cleverness a warning borne out by the next two features neither of which offered up more than fabulous production design. The new film is as meticulously constructed but what won French audiences over wasnt simply Tautous elfin allure but Jeunets vision of Paris as a cloistered small town eternally innocent of the larger world. When Amelie opened last April (after the scandal of a Cannes rejection) Parisians lined up by the thousands to take in a film about their city in which there wasnt a tourist in sight and all the neighborhood regulars come off more au lait than espresso. The films nostalgia is as leaden as its whimsy and even more toxic; its no wonder that it will likely end up the countrys big box-office success of the year. Just last week France submitted it as its candidate for Best Foreign-Language Film at the next Academy Awards. Miramax which is distributing Amelie in the United States is even said to be considering a run for Best Picture. Can 60 million Frenchmen and -women be wrong? Can Harvey Weinstein? No not exactly -- the film will make a bundle here. But it still wont be good.AMELIE | Directed by JEAN-PIERRE JEUNET Written by JEUNET and GUILLAUME LAURANT Produced by CLAUDIE OSSARD | Released by Miramax Films | At Laemmles Royal Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

"Yesterday He Was Nobody Today Hes a Wanted Man | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Style amp; Design Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Yesterday He Was Nobody Today Hes a Wanted Man By Andrew Sarris  11/05/01 1200am Joel Coens The Man Who Wasnt There  from a screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen and produced by Ethan Coen professes to return us to the black-and-white world of 40s and 50s film noir California style specifically evoked by the grubby middle-class protagonists of James M. Cains sardonically well-plotted thrillers such as are to be found in Billy Wilders Double Indemnity (1944) Michael Curtizs Mildred Pierce (1945) and Tay Garnetts The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946). Still the Coen Brothers themselves have never been strangers to violence from their first film Blood Simple (1984) through Millers Crossing (1990) and the much-honored Fargo (1996). Nor are they unfamiliar with such Hollywood classics of the 40s as Preston Sturges Sullivans Travels (1942) from which they lifted the satiric bleeding-heart title O Brother Where Art Thou? (2000) and Alfred Hitchcocks Shadow of a Doubt (1943) from which they admiringly appropriated the locale of Santa Rosa Calif. for The Man Who Wasnt There . Roger Deakins the cinematographer for this and five previous Coen Brothers films was more influenced by such 40s Alan Ladd noir vehicles as Frank Tuttles This Gun for Hire (1942) with cinematography by John Seitz and George Marshalls The Blue Dahlia (1946) with Lionel Lindons cinematography. Yet when one looks at The Man Who Wasnt There  one is not reminded visually of these 40s noirs-perhaps because the film has been shot in finely grained color and then printed in black and white. The result is a pervasive grayness that suggests a color film with all the color sucked out of it. Yet having described the sources of the films ""look"" I realize that the Coen Brothers are artists and not mimics. Their story of a small-town barber named Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) his adventures and misadventures is completely original in its fix on the world of 1949. As Ed sees his place in this world he must accept the dead-end drudgery of working as second barber in his brother-in-law Franks (Michael Badalucco) barber shop. He has also resigned himself to his wife Doris (Frances McDormand) infidelity with her overbearing boss Big Dave (James Gandolfini). Ed doesnt say much to anybody and most of what we know about his feelings about other people comes from his deadpan ironically stoic inner monologues. And here is where the Coen Brothers strike pay dirt. Indeed Mr. Thornton is so quietly funny in his unflappably uninsistent way that he creates for my money at least the most strikingly engaging character in a movie I have seen all year-though I think his performance is too marvelously controlled and spectacularly self-effacing for a vulgar prize like the Oscar. Around his memorable incarnation of a self-fashioned nobody revolves a wild assortment of extroverts. Doris has long since given up on getting a rise from Ed. His ever-ebullient Italian-American in-laws have given up on understanding his strange silences and non-reactions. Meanwhile Big Dave patronizes Ed without worrying about the worm ever turning. Then one evening after closing time a nervy customer with a toupee barges into the shop and demands a haircut. Frank is about to throw the interloper out when Ed volunteers to cut the mans hair. Frank leaves and the customer introduces himself with a business card as Creighton Tolliver (Jon Polito) the inventor and promoter of a new process called dry cleaning. He is in town seeking capital for this business chance of a lifetime. Ed visits Tolliver in his hotel room the next morning and after fending off a homosexual pass is told that he can become a partner in Tollivers enterprise if he comes up with 10000. Ed says he can get the money by the next day. He proceeds to send a blackmail note to Big Dave threatening to reveal the affair with Doris to Daves wife. Big Dave pays up Ed gives the money to Tolliver and-two murders one suicide two trials and an automobile accident later-Ed finds himself at the bottom of an abyss from which he cannot escape. Although Eds predicament resembles that of John Garfields character in The Postman Always Rings Twice  there are important differences as well. For all his meditations Ed has never premeditated anything and his downfall is not caused by a femme fatale . Indeed in his marriage Ed is sexless almost to the point of celibacy and in the one sexual opportunity presented to him he is repressed. He is simply the victim of some of lifes most grotesque ironies which he never stops trying to understand in his dry droll manner. The Man Who Wasnt There is all there artistically speaking but it never pretends to be a feel-good entertainment. Major Alterations Diane Doniol-Valcroze and Arthur Flams Kill by Inches  from their own screenplay starts out as a wickedly stylized derisively grotesque contemplation of the obsessive world of the tailor and gradually descends into the gruesome horror of a deadly sibling rivalry springing from hatred over the ridiculous ability to take a clients measurements without the help of a measuring tape. Thomas (Emmanuel Salinger) is a mediocre tailor justifiably insecure about his abilities. When his twin sister Vera (Myriam Cyr) arrives for the Tailors Ball Competition Gala he soon realizes that she possesses most of the intuitive talent in the family and will easily eclipse him at the gala. This will never do and as he has already grimly demonstrated with a recalcitrant client he is willing to kill to preserve his illusion of professional mastery. Gradually gruesomely he sinks into complete madness and the tools of his trade-shears needles pins and even measuring tape-become the implements of murder. Even when he wins the absurd non-tape-measuring contest at the gala the plaque he receives cannot cure Thomas of his guilt-drenched mania. Instead he finally marches inch by inch into the ultimate darkness. This is another of those films ostensibly in the English language to avoid the commercial handicap of subtitles in the American market that nonetheless plays like a foreign film with no discernible locale. Ms. Valcroze is the daughter of critic-director Jacques Doniol-Valcroze one of the founders of Cahiers du Cinema  and has made several short films in France. Mr. Flam is a New Yorker who has written directed and produced several successful short films in English. Their collaboration has resulted in a film with minimal dialogue particularly from Mr. Salinger who has established his reputation in France with several French-speaking performances. Ironically Ms. Cyr has already appeared in English-speaking roles in her native Canada and elsewhere but is given almost no lines to speak in Kill by Inches . Instead she exchanges cryptic expressions with Mr. Salinger that convey their mutual mistrust and resentment. Consequently the thought occurred to me during the film that it could have been done as a French film with or without subtitles like a malignant Hulot or as an animated cartoon or even as a silent film. This is to say that the graphics speak volumes while the dialogue is excessively laconic and unfocused. One suspects that Mr. Salinger does not speak enough English to carry on a conversation and this makes him appear terribly strange and unbalanced from the very beginning. Where the film functions most felicitously is in its parade of clients before the tailor. Few are especially photogenic and many are downright ugly in face age and physical endowments. More than a few seem hostile to the whole procedure and it is this unspoken tension between the tailor and his customers that gives the film the comically corrosive quality that carries it past the mandatory Grand Guignol. Cannes Is Fuming Amelie Is a Hit Jean-Pierre Jeunets Amelie  from a screenplay by Guillaume Laurant and Mr. Jeunet became a cause celebre some months ago when it was pointedly rejected by the Cannes Film Festival and then went on to break box-office records in Paris. It has since been rejected by the New York Film Festival. The question was asked why the allegedly elitist festival pickers for Cannes and New York did not appreciate the merits of a happy film the Parisian public adored. Since I was once an elitist festival picker myself I kept an open mind on the subject until I could see the film for myself. At the local screening I attended much of the audience found the film moderately amusing but I doubt that it will appeal overall to New Yorkers as much as it did to Parisians. It is a Paris film par excellence and not without its charms and pleasant eccentricities but it is much more elaborate and complicated and extended to the point of distension than I had anticipated. If anything it is overwritten and overdirected for the quaint simple feelings it attempts to project. In fact I am a little surprised that the Parisian public loved it so much. For one thing Amelie at 8 years old (Flora Guiet) has more funny things happen during her unhappy childhood than the grown-up Amelie (Audrey Tautou) has happen in her interminable career as a meddlesome Miss Fix-It in the lives of a variety of loners losers and misfits. Ms. Tautou has her moments but her excruciatingly delayed union with Nino Quincampoix (Mathieu Kassovitz) becomes too tedious to be heartwarming.

"`Amelie Is A Tasty Bit Of French Pastry - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections `Amelie Is A Tasty Bit Of French PastryMovies - REVIEW - AmelieThe Playful Film Is Not Too Sweet But Just Right For The Cinematic Palate.November 16 2001|By Jay Boyar Sentinel Movie CriticIn Amelie the city of Paris becomes a giant Rube Goldberg machine -- a series of interlocking parts in which a sneeze at one end of town can through an elaborate chain of events result in a traffic snarl at the other.This is the stuff of slapstick comedy and philosophical theory. Amelie (which opens today) contains both -- and a lot more too.Ingeniously ebullient this French film is a huge hit in its native land where it has reportedly grossed 40 million. That mon ami is a lot of croissants.Early press reports have described Amelie in uniformly sunny terms -- a ""cinematic bon-bon"" according to The New York Times. Its feel-good vibe begins with its view of Paris which in addition to being a Goldberg machine is a storybook village full of old-fashioned Gallic charm.Among its most charming residents is Amelie the films do-gooder heroine. A pretty young waitress at a Montmartre cafe she flashes a girlish grin bats her avid eyes and smooths her pert Louise Brooks bob.Early in the film Amelie discovers an old box of childhood treasures tracks down its owner and without revealing herself returns it to him. Shes so turned on by the experience that she resolves to keep up the anonymous good deeds playing matchmaker convincing a sad woman that her dead husband loved her and so on.In the case of someone she disapproves of Amelie is not above the occasional bad deed. An unpleasant merchant arrives home to find that someone has maddeningly -- and cleverly -- booby-trapped his apartment. (Amelies reprogramming of his phones speed dial is an especially diabolical touch.)If Amelie is a bon-bon its only semi-sweet. The films flip mechanical view of the world helps it to avoid the curse of easy sentimentality In one memorably hilarious sequence a woman is crushed to death when a suicide jumps from a building and happens to land on her.More Looney Tunes than Julie Andrews that is.Amelie may strike some French-film buffs as being sweeter than it really is because the previous films of director Jean-Pierre Jeunet -- Delicatessen (1991) The City of Lost Children (1995) and Alien Resurrection (1997) -- are so very sour.Still in all of his movies including the new one Jeunet displays a visual zaniness.So as Amelie goes about her own and other peoples business this contraption of a film becomes a wild ride. Flamboyant camera angles and rapid cutting are part of the trip as are wacky effects.Clouds shape themselves into animals pictures of animals talk to each other and a statue comes to life. When our heroine feels like crying her entire body becomes a sudden shower of tears. And as she falls in love were treated to a quick X-ray view of her palpitating neon-red heart.But can a woman as determinedly detached as Amelie allow herself to discover the romantic bliss that she so doggedly seeks for others?This movie (which is presented with English subtitles) begins with a 20-minute sequence recounting Amelies childhood. Narrated by an omniscient storyteller this sequence has the feeling of a silent-film comedy of the Jacques Tati (Mr. Hulots Holiday) school. And the hilariously exaggerated performances carry that feeling into the rest of the film.Director Jeunet and his frequent collaborator Guillaume Laurant co-wrote the script which has fun with variations on stock characters. Theres Amelie (Audrey Tautou) the gamine; Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz) her dashing heartthrob; Raphael her reclusive father; etc.These are all recognizable ""types"" yet theyre all distinctive enough to avoid being stereotypes.Amelies nearly unshakable detachment and furious do-goodism for example place her in a gamine class all her own. Nino meanwhile works at an adult-video store and collects discarded photo-booth strips in his spare time.This is not your mothers dashing heartthrob.Tautou is gloriously alive in the title role as both a cog in the movies Rube Goldberg device and someone worthy of special concern. As for the supporting players theyre thoroughly in tune with the films neo-slapstick spirit.When Amelie isnt racing around on her latest scheme she may pause for an amusing inquiry. At one point she stops to consider just how many people are experiencing an orgasm at that very moment.Amelie is also given to listing her ""favorite things"" which turn out to be rather more imaginative in their specificity than The Sound of Musics raindrops on roses or whiskers on kittens.She likes cracking the top of a creme brulee with her spoon sticking her hand into sacks of grain ""skimming"" stones across water and turning around at the movies to look back at the audiences faces.Watching Amelie you can get so caught up in its playfulness youll be tempted to turn around too. Chances are however you wont.That would mean missing a moment or two of this wonderful fanciful film.

There she is shyly waiting her turn at Monsieur Collignons fruit stall or unobtrusively waiting on tables at les Deux Moulins a bistro in Paris. But in Jean-Pierre Jeunets exquisite whimsical ""Amelie"" shes more than a roving wallflower. Amelie Poulain (Audrey Tautou) is about to become something of an undercover saint. Her evolution is the charming chapter and verse of Jeunet and co-writer Guillaume Laurants French fable. The movie was an enormous success in France. And if theres any justice in the world it will be equally appreciated here. Unfortunately our local exhibitor Cineplex Odeon has booked ""Amelie"" only at the cramped Dupont Circle theater where if a movie patron wishes to shift his position everyone else in the theater has to stand up and hold his breath. Go figure One of the 10 best movies of the year is booked into the theatrical equivalent of a Port-O-Potty. Fans of writer-director Jeunet who made ""Delicatessen"" and ""The City of Lost Children"" know what bounties to expect here. The movies narrative inventiveness puts most filmmakers to shame. The same goes for its visual compositions and the editing which charge ""Amelie"" with pulsating life. Eight-year-old Amelie (played by Flora Guiet) so craves affection from her father a doctor that her heart races whenever he places his stethoscope to her heart. Concluding his daughter has an unusual heart condition he confines her to a sedentary childhood. And he unwittingly sets her destiny. When the grown Amelie discovers a hidden box of childhood treasures left years ago by a previous tenant when he was a boy shes determined to find its owner. Amelie finally locates Monsieur Bretodeau (Maurice Benichou) anonymously steers him toward the box then watches the old man dissolve into rapturous tears. Amelie already sensitive to the misunderstood eccentric and lonely around her makes a quiet decision to transform as many sad lives as she can. She also takes care of those offenders such as her father who might deserve a little punishment. Two of her more benevolent targets are grumpy Joseph (Dominique Pinon) a jilted lover who comes every day to les Deux Moulins to pout theatrically at his ex who works there; and cashier Georgette a hypochondriac who also works at the place. Both need love in their lives. So Amelie becomes a matchmaker - secretly of course. She meets a potential soul mate Nino Quicampoix (Mathieu Kassovitz) a genial loner who works part time as a porno store clerk and a ""ghost"" in a haunted house ride and who collects discarded photographs from train station photo booths. Amelie has to decide if her ability to change peoples lives applies to herself. ""Amelie"" (its original title ""Le Fabuleux Destin dAmelie Poulain"" or ""The Fabulous Destiny of Amelie Poulain"") whizzes by like a blur of brilliance. As soon as you start to appreciate one of cinematographer Bruno Delbonnels arresting tableaux or another hilarious aside from omniscient narrator Jacques Thebault theres something equally compelling a moment later. Its also a love letter to Paris (at least that romantic Paris of the mind) and a passing tribute to such French artists as the Renoirs (Pierre Auguste the painter and Jean his filmmaking son) and filmmakers Marcel Carne and Rene Clair. Ultimately ""Amelie"" is a movie for aesthetically hungry moviegoers wildly amusing sometimes sardonic and always touching. Theres so much here and all of it delightful that you have to make an immediate resolution to see it over. For ""Amelie"" is a charm that bears watching again and again.

"Amelie Candy-Coated Magically Delicious washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Movies Amelie Candy-Coated Magically Delicious Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Rita Kempley Washington Post Staff Writer Friday November 9 2001 ""Amelie"" a delectable French confection in the spirit of ""Chocolat"" is sure to please Americas sweet tooth. Compared with this ooh-la-licious bonbon last years charmer is merely a Whitmans Sampler. Not that theres anything wrong with that. Both movies deal in magical realism and center on women who meddle in other peoples lives and might have been hard to tell apart if it werent for the visual dynamics and whimsical storytelling of ""Amelie"" director Jean-Pierre Jeunet. ""Amelie"" marks a departure in tone for Jeunet whose films tend toward twisted fare like 1991s cannibalism comedy ""Delicatessen"" and 1995s macabre fairy tale ""The City of Lost Children."" This film is an endearing import but also has a darkly funny side. The latter comes into play in the quirky prologue that introduces Amelie Poulain a clever pixie whose overprotective parents keep her isolated from other kids. So Amelie grows into a lonesome child becoming all the more withdrawn when her mother is smooshed by a suicide plummeting from a spire of Notre Dame. Afterward her father ignores her devoting himself to creating the ultimate creche for his wifes urn. Imagination becomes her only companion. By the time we catch up with the grown-up Amelie (Audrey Tautou) a shy but mischievous waitress at a tiny cafe she is still living in a world of her own. But her life takes a dramatic turn when she discovers a rusty box of childhood treasures that some child hid behind a bathroom tile decades earlier. She seeks out the original owner now in his fifties and anonymously returns the cache. This random act of kindness brings tears to his eyes and inspires Amelie to go about improving other peoples lives. Among them that of her mopey father who is still working on the shrine after all these years; a sour grocer who belittles his slow assistant; a fragile shut-in who copies Renoirs ""Luncheon of the Boating Party"" once every year; and a hypochondriac tobacconist itching for love. As she learns to shape the fates of others Amelie realizes that she is just as capable of orchestrating her own dream. This hinges on gathering up the courage to approach the love of her life (Mathieu Kassovitz). While leading him through a series of cat-and-mouse games she gradually forges the chutzpah to make her move. It takes a little longer than it probably should but thats a quibble considering the complexity of the plot Jeunets attention to detail - whether photographing a garden gnome a smoldering Gitane or the cobblestones of Montmartre. All of Jeunets work would have been for naught if the gamin Tautou werent at the center of this delightful swirl. ""Amelie"" is joie de vivre in a nougat.

Shed been to an advance screening and was all aglow. ""I really needed that movie."" ""Amelie"" the absolutely beguiling romantic comedy from French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (""Delicatessen"" ""City of Lost Children"") may indeed be just the tonic for demoralized spirits. What could be more fun than an adorable Frenchwoman in cute outfits who sets out to improve the world? From its first frames -- a picturesque Paris street glowing in golden morning light a summer breeze causing wineglasses to dance on a tablecloth -- its clear were in magical territory. Our guide through this fairyland is Amelie Poulain (Audrey Tautou) a solitary young woman who works in a Paris cafe and visits her widowed father on weekends. One day a chance discovery in her apartment leads to a ""surge of love"" within her. (Yes this is magic all right; most of us just find dust bunnies.) Henceforth Amelie decides to help mankind by quirkily interfering in the lives of those around her. All this results in happiness and eventual love even for Amelie. ""Amelie""  With Audrey Tautou Mathieu Kassovitz Rufus Yolande Moreau Arthus de Penguern. Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet from a screenplay by Guillaume Laurant and Jeunet. 120 minutes. Rated R for sexual content. In French with English subtitles. Egyptian. Jeunets camera slyly introduces Tautou Shes in the cafe facing away from us then slowly turns around -- and oh that face. A pixie-ish combination of Audrey Hepburn and Juliette Binoche Tautou sports a perky Louise Brooks bob big melted-chocolate eyes a breathy high-pitched voice and a turned-up smile. Its not exactly an acting tour de force -- the movie mostly just requires Tautou to be devastatingly cute -- but shes only 23 and the camera loves her. (Tautous not exactly an unknown gamine-of-the-month She won a Cesar -- the French Oscar -- for ""most promising young actress"" last year for her work in ""Venus Beauty Institute."") Jeunet intricately constructs the film as both Amelies story (and the intersecting stories of those whose lives she touches) and a love letter to picture-perfect Paris. Its a warm-and-fuzzy valentine shot through with plenty of red (in the costumes in Amelies red-wallpapered apartment) and a generous sprinkling of whimsy. Amelies bedside lamp is a pig holding an umbrella who at one point joins in the commentary. And when Amelie beholds the man she will love (Mathieu Kassovitz as the hopeful-looking Nino who collects photo-booth strips) she visibly melts turning into a splash of water on the cafe floor. Surprisingly this doesnt feel too cutesy but perfectly reasonable Jeunets world contains just enough darkness (we see early scenes of the death of Amelies mother and of the young Amelies loneliness) that the sweetness is welcome and deserved. ""Amelie"" is given charming texture throughout by characters sharing their likes and dislikes Amelies father (Rufus) loves to peel away large strips of wallpaper; Amelie herself loves to plunge her hand into a sack of grain or to crack the top of a creme brulee with a spoon.

Starring Audrey Tautou and Mathieu Kassovitz. Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet. (VHS and DVD. R. 120 minutes.) ""Amelie"" is a charmer a movie whose embrace of cinema is so passionate it could be mistaken for an embrace of life. Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (""The City of Lost Children"" ""Delicatessen"") has come close to making a great movie which is closer than most directors ever come. Where his film misses the mark is not in its execution but in its inspiration. Something is missing -- some initial need to say something some depth of emotion some extra idea. Still everything is striking including Audrey Tautou as Amelie. With her large black eyes pale skin and placid expression she looks and moves like some gentle extraterrestrial -- one with an extra sense. Amelie is the ideal surrogate for the director the embodiment of Jeunets compassion and vague disconnection. Amelie is 23 and working in cafe in Paris. One day she discovers a tin box that a boy hid in her apartment some 40 years before. She finds the owner of the box and the effect on the now middle-aged man is so rich and transformative that she makes it her mission to do good deeds for people. Amelie discovers the box on the night she finds out that Princess Diana has been killed. Theres no connection between the events just an acknowledgment of the weird simultaneity of life. ""Amelie"" is at its best in conveying a mystical sense of life going by of a universe of individual poignant moments rising up and receding. Its a sense that cinema with its unlimited visual palette is uniquely suited to conveying and Jeunet is sincere in his attempt to do so. Too bad ""Amelie"" doesnt find its main story in its heroines efforts to help people. Instead it goes in a romantic direction and becomes self- conscious. Amelie sets her sights on a young fellow who works in a pornography store and spends his free time piecing together discarded photos. Its all too fey. It also takes far too long. ""Amelie"" creates a lot of audience good will with its glorious beginning but it tests that good will in its last half hour. . Contains brief nudity and sexual situations.

One drawback of seeing 200 or so films a year is that movie reviewers know all the terrible things that can happen. A smart comedy can turn cloying in the last act. A suspenseful thriller can spin out of control and go over the top. An episodic film that excels in character and mood will suddenly get weighed down with plot. Its nerve-wracking. Amelie a French film so terrific it might single-handedly rescue the ""feel-good movie"" from the garbage heap of overused and discredited phrases runs two hours. I sat through it with a smile in my heart (and more often than not also on my face) but fearing that each glorious second would be the last. The movie starts with an exhilarating rush. Deep into it when things slow down (as they inevitably must) my heart sank. Would Amelie turn out to be too much of a good thing? Perhaps the filmmakers would stretch a brilliant 90-minute movie into a 180-minute monster that wears out its welcome. Im pleased to report they didnt. Amelie quite simply is unadulterated fun. The title character is a 23-year-old waitress in a Paris cafe. Her sense of whimsy colors everything she does. Were first introduced to her as a child. Her parents are repressed sorts congenitally averse to fun which probably is why she develops such an overactive imagination. Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Delicatessen The City of Lost Children) has a marvelously playful visual sense that he allows to run wild. We see little Amelie talking with fanciful creatures making faces picking out animal shapes in clouds. Little changes after she grows up. When she discovers a tin box filled with toys trinkets and a photograph hidden behind the baseboards of her apartment she resolves to track down the little boy who hid it there decades earlier. Seeing how happy she made him she makes the creation of similar little miracles her lifes work. Amelie is like a performance artist whose raw material is life and whose stage is the workaday world. Her schemes are as cunning and intricate as a Rube Goldberg cartoon or a Mission Impossible plot. She does everything behind the scenes. Most of her actions are designed to bring joy to other people or open them to new ways of seeing. But when a shopkeeper mistreats a retarded employee Amelie punishes him in the same secretive subtle manner. The irony of course is that bringing joy to others and correcting wrongs are the only pleasures in Amelies life. Shes a cutie and she has a good heart yet shes as lonely as anyone she meets. One of her neighbors is a man with brittle bones who never ventures out of doors. He spends his days painting. For 20 years he has painted copies of a single painting Pierre-Auguste Renoirs The Luncheon of the Boating Party. Amelie identifies with the girl at the center of the painting who seems alone though surrounded by merrymakers. Then Amelie meets a young man who is as eccentric as she is. He collects discarded photographs near the photo booth at the train station. Intrigued after finding his massive photo album Amelie sets out to find him. The big question is whether she will be able to break out of her patterns and work a miracle for herself. Grade A+ Todays Deals Wide-Ruled 70-Sheet Spiral-Bound Notebook for 17 cents +...

Rick Groen From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Friday Nov. 09 2001 1200AM EST Last updated Saturday Mar. 21 2009 1136AM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Amelie Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet Written by Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Guillaume Laurant Starring Audrey Tautou and Mathieu Kassovitz Classification AA Rating  Amelie is a feel-good flick with artsy ambitions -- sentimentality with an aesthetic veneer. That may explain why the movie is all the rage in its native France why it waltzed away with the Peoples Choice award at the Toronto International Film Festival and why its already generating Oscar buzz keen to become this years answer to Chocolat. In fact it aims to be a better answer and a superior confection boosted by a strategy as shrewd as it is simple. Feel-good pix are often a guilty pleasure -- we cringe at the very thing we bask in all that unalloyed sweetness-and-light. But this one is designed to be risk-free to deal out the saccharine pleasure while offering the artsiness as an antidote to the residual guilt. That allows us to affix labels like ""delightful"" and ""charming"" without any irksome reservation. At least thats the plan. And it works well like a charm -- until the spell wears off. Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet wastes no time putting his inventive stamp on the picture. Breaking a cardinal rule of cinema the first 15 minutes unfold entirely as voice-over narration. But this stuff is appealingly different. Instead of literary and languid the voice-over preface is highly visual and lightning fast. It establishes the strange birth and background of the title character her peculiar likes and dislikes. It presents the city of Paris in a significant supporting role with the camera exploring the streets as only a resident can -- past boites down back alleys into intriguing crannies. And it showcases Jeunets quirky sense of humour and style -- shot through a filter brightly with the inserted use of quick flashbacks and newsreel footage and even the occasional burst of animation. The narration ends the plot begins but this beguiling style never lets up -- its a constant through the rest of the movie. So is Amelie grown into a twentysomething waitress toiling in a Montmartre eatery. Back in her apartment after a long shift she happens upon a childs treasure box hidden behind the bathroom wall. Filled with tiny toys and mementos it was clearly secreted away decades ago by a little boy part of a family that once occupied her flat. Amelie manages to track down the boxs now-middle-aged owner and from an unobserved distance she watches as the man opens the case whereupon his childhood memories flood forth. Hes touched and shes inspired vowing to take up a life of good deeds to become ""the goddess of the unloved."" What follows takes place over the weekend of Princess Dis fatal crash -- as one mythologized figure dies another is born. From there our perky deity goes to work describing the joyous sights of Paris to a blind man; boosting the self-esteem of an abused grocers assistant; whisking away the ingrained cynicism of her widowed landlady; encouraging her house-bound father to leave the cocoon; setting up an amorous match between a pair of lonely-hearts in the restaurant. This is an ingenious do-gooder -- her schemes are usually elaborate in design and often amusing in execution. Theyre fun to watch precisely because the sentimentality is liberally spiked with humour. Fun too is Audrey Tautou in the title part. With her brown doe-eyes and pageboy do she plays Amelie as an almost sexless gamine a kind of Shakespearean sprite flitting through a late-summers night dream. Yet sprites are catalysts who emerge unchanged from the reactions they incite. And this is where the film runs into problems when the plot takes a ""Physician heal thyself"" twist and Amelie looks to find her one true love (Mathieu Kassovitz). Her own transformation from platonic Pollyanna to smitten kitten is the least interesting of the bunch. At this point everything that had worked before -- the breathless pacing the Paris travelogue the idiosyncratic visuals -- start to outstay their welcome. The charm hasnt completely gone but its definitely thinning out and even a lovely tableau at the climax cant restore the receptive mood. Jeunet is something of a specialist in fantasies albeit typically of the darker variety -- the satiric cannibalism of Delicatessen the monstrous doings of Alien Resurrection. Its refreshing then to see him ply his stylistic magic toward a brighter end. Indeed only the most hardened cynic would argue that all this positive sound and happy fury signify nothing. Nope what they signify is sweet nothing -- and while it lasts thats something.

Amelie Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2001) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/amelie-2001,200,amelie22,amelie,rogerebert
"CNN.com - Review Amelie is imaginative - November 7 2001 MAIN PAGE EUROPE WORLD WEATHER BUSINESS BIZ TRAVELLER SCI-TECH ENTERTAINMENT SPECIAL REPORTS SPORT at SI.com SERVICES E-MAIL SERVICES CNN MOBILE CNN AVANT GO DESKTOP TICKER ABOUT US AD INFO CNN TV whats on biz international inside sailing design360 the music room show transcripts how to get CNN TV CNN Partner Hotels EDITIONS CNN.com U.S. CNN.com Asia CNNArabic.com CNNEspanol.com set your edition Languages --------- Arabic Japanese Spanish Portuguese German Italian Korean Time Inc. --------- Time.com People Fortune EW Review Amelie is imaginative By Paul TataraCNN Reviewer (CNN) -- Jean-Pierre Jeunets ""Amelie"" is an energetic fantasy about a young French woman who tries to spin lifes random disappointments into existential cotton candy. Although Jeunet has largely retreated from the grotesqueries of ""Delicatessen"" and ""City of Lost Children"" (both of which he co-directed with Marc Caro) ""Amelie"" remains a highlight reel of gorgeous production design and out-there photographic effects. Its whimsical free-ranging nature is often enchanting; the first hour in particular is brimming with amiable sardonic laughs. But there comes a point where you feel like Jeunet is forcing whimsy down your throat with a plunger. Like Terry Gilliam -- who helped get ""Delicatessen"" released in America -- hes almost too imaginative for his own good. ""Amelie"" opens with one of the most delightful sequences of the year a lengthy montage full of sometimes sad sometimes joyous images. As it unfolds an omniscient narrator describes the obscure likes and dislikes of the people inhabiting Amelies world. Her mother for instance is keen on how fingers look when they wrinkle in the bathtub and her dad cant get enough of vacuuming and re-organizing his tool box. When shes older Amelie will work at a cafe where a regular customers favorite pastime is secretly popping bubble wrap. Amelies lonely childhood is filled with misassumptions and wild flights of fancy. Her stand-offish doctor-father determines that she has a dangerous heart murmur and must be home-schooled but were told that her heart rate speeds up during the examination because a person she loves finally places a hand on her.

Well AmAlie - a giddy whirl of invention and romance from writer-director Jean-Pierre Jeunet - is a feel-good movie in the absolute best sense.Especially now when events near and far arent offering much to feel good about this delirious domino-like cascade of cause and effect love and destiny and a wide-eyed waitress who perpetrates well-intentioned mischief on the world does something at once restorative and thrilling it celebrates humanity. Seriously. Kid you not.Jeunet the French filmmaker whose first couple of flicks Delicatessen and The City of Lost Children (codirected with fellow comic book maven-cineaste Marc Caro) were gloriously dark cartoonish comedies of the grotesque has taken those films ricocheting rhythms and wacko characters and infused them with light. (Jeunet on his own also directed Alien Resurrection the third and murkiest of the Alien sequels.) Candy-colored splashed with whimsy and propelled by Parisian accordion strains AmAlie zips along in such a spirited rush that its sometimes hard to keep up. But that doesnt mean one tires of trying. Breathlessness and a wide smile are this movies side-effects.AmAlie Poulain (the title in France where the film has turned into a phenomenon translates to The Fabulous Destiny of AmAlie Poulain) works in a little Montmartre cafe. In a hysterical and poignant prologue we see AmAlie as a child craving filial affection raised by a physician father with a frosty demeanor - so cold in fact that he misdiagnoses his daughters palpitating heart when he examines her believing her to be infirm when in fact shes only experiencing the excitement of rare physical contact with her parent. AmAlies mother cannot offer much more in the way of love She dies in a freak accident. And so AmAlie grows up on her own home-schooled and sheltered from the outside world.Accustomed to solitude and living inside her head the young woman moves to Paris where she begins to realize shes not the only person who feels alone. In fact there seems to be a city of people in need of connection. The chance discovery of a childs cache of toys and trinkets hidden in a bathroom wall is the catalyst for what comes next AmAlie decides to track down the now grown-up owner of the treasure-box and surreptitiously arrange its return. When she witnesses the mans joyous startled reaction (shes spying from nearby) she knows what she must do next fix the lives and loves of other people around her. And so all of AmAlies elfish meddling matchmaking and maneuvering begins. (And some very funny gnome-napping too.)Audrey Tautou who shares something of the gamine quality of an earlier generations Audrey (as in Hepburn) infuses the title role with such spark and charm (and saucer-size eyes) that its impossible to imagine anyone else doing the job. The rest of AmAlies cast - from Jeunet regular Dominique Pinon (as a cantankerous cafe denizen) to Isabelle Nanty (the tobacconist AmAlie schemes to fix him up with) to Michel Robin (a painter too scared to venture from his apartment) - make a delightfully peculiar gang. And Mathieu Kassovitz playing a porn shop cashier who collects jettisoned photo strips from those subway photo booths brings a likeable obliviousness to the table. (Literally to the table - he always sits at the same booth in AmAlies cafe.) Its Kassovitzs Nino who presents the biggest challenge to AmAlie Can she do unto herself what shes done to others?Theres real magic in this movie - and enough energy to power a whole city on a dark and gloomy night.Steven Reas e-mail address is sreaphillynews.com.AmAlie Produced by Claudie Ossard directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet written by Guillaume Laurant and Jeunet photography by Bruno Delbonnel music by Yann Tiersen distributed by Miramax Films.

"Audrey Tautou delights in French romantic comedy Amelie - Page 2 - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs (Page 2 of 2)Audrey Tautou delights in French romantic comedy AmelieAmelie (star)(star)(star)(star)November 09 2001|By Michael Wilmington Tribune movie critic.Jeunets eye and buoyant storytelling keep you watching the way he and cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel train their camera on the parks trees waterways picturesque buildings and curving streets and alleys. But much of the films immense appeal comes from his youthful star Tautou her dark eyes and dazzling warming smile. Winner of the French Oscar (or ""Cesar"") for her touching ingenue part in last years ""Venus Beauty Institute"" Tautou is another of those French Belles de Jour -- from Catherine Deneuve to Julie Delpy and Juliette Binoche -- who can lift your spirits and break your heart with a glance.Here shes also the centerpiece of a formidable comic gallery of charmers eye-catchers and grotesques. Kassovitz whose dark intensity sometimes suggests a French John Turturro (and who as the director of ""Hate"" is a prodigious filmmaker as well) is just right for the goofy obsessed Nino the perfect screw-loose beau for a daffy sprite like Amelie. Dominique Pinon the sawed-off hipster troll of ""Delicatessen"" and ""Lost Children"" (and most memorably of ""Diva"") is a fine nasty little customer Rufus an engagingly addled dad. Merlin exudes delicate eccentricity as the Renoir-copier and Amelies cafe mates (including Isabelle Nanty and Claire Maurier the mother in Truffauts ""400 Blows"") are an attractively neurotic or tenderhearted bunch.But its the combo of Jeunet and Tautou that make ""Amelie"" so distinctive so spry and intoxicating. ""Amelie"" wafts us back to the fairytale France that once seduced international moviegoers in the days of ""Le Million"" ""The Red Balloon"" ""Mon Oncle"" but it also shows all the things -- some sexual some political -- that now grace the screen since those more innocent days. See it with eyes opened wide and your heart on your sleeve. This is the Paris -- and the mad beautiful young Parisienne -- we look for in dreams.`Amelie(star)(star)(star)(star)Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet; written by Guillaume Laurant Jeunet; photographed by Bruno Delbonnel; edited by Herve Schneid; sets designed by Aline Bonetto; music by Yann Tiersen; produced by Claudie Ossard.

Charles Taylor Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News If Terry Southerns novel ""The Magic Christian"" were produced by the folks at the Welcome Wagon the result might be something like ""Amelie."" ""The Magic Christian"" is about a millionaire who uses his money to set up a series of elaborate and vicious practical jokes to demonstrate that everyone has his price. Its a book written for the vengeful adolescent in all of us. ""Amelie"" is a movie made for the wide-eyed child wed like to flatter ourselves exists in all of us. The title character (played by Audrey Tautou) is a cafe waitress who takes it upon herself to become a sort of do-gooding practical joker setting up a series of schemes and pranks that will bring happiness to the people she targets. ""Amelie"" has been a phenomenon in France causing lines around the block and taking in the equivalent of nearly 40 million. It wouldnt surprise me at all if the movie were a big art-house hit here. Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet who with Marc Caro co-directed ""Delicatessen"" and ""The City of Lost Children"" ""Amelie"" is clever and skillful and pleasing to look at. The bright colors are like inviting pieces of candy and cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel has given even the muted browns and dark reds of the interiors a deep cozy glow. And in many ways ""Amelie"" is just what audiences seem to crave right now. Who could blame moviegoers for latching onto a picture thats intended as an affirmation of what connects people rather than what divides them that says it wouldnt kill us to treat each other a little more decently? The problem is that the charm and good spirits of ""Amelie"" feel calculated rather than natural. Jeunet has said that after making ""Delicatessen"" ""The City of Lost Children"" and ""Alien Resurrection"" he wanted to make a movie that wasnt so dark. What links ""Amelie"" to those movies is that Jeunet is still in love with fantasy and with the trickery that movies are capable of. Amelie herself is a lost child in Paris. The movie opens with flashes of her childhood. Were told that she so craved affection from her cold-fish father a doctor that whenever he examined her her heart would beat uncontrollably leading him to decide she had a weak ticker and that she should be shielded from excitement by being home-schooled. The doc is all shes left with after her mother is killed in a freak accident and by the time she moves to Paris as a young woman shes led a very sheltered life. The kicker of course is that she winds up in a city where the worldly people she meets -- her co-workers at the cafe and the people in her apartment building -- are just as alone as she is. Its a recovered bit of childhood fantasy -- a boys box of childhood treasures that she discovers hidden behind a wall in her flat -- that sends Amelie on her mission. She engineers the boxs return to its owner making him think that fate alone has reunited him with his lost treasures and observes the happiness it brings him. From there shes off playing matchmaker between a surly cafe customer (Jeunet regular Dominique Pinon with his pushed-in face and protruding lips the mug of a pipsqueak tough guy) and the cafes hypochondriac tobacconist (Isabelle Naty whose sturdy build stands in comic contrast to her affected sickroom demeanor). Amelie brings a taste of the worlds delights to a delicate artist (Michel Robin) who hasnt left his apartment in 20 years and acts as an avenging angel against a grocer (Urbain Cancellier) who mistreats his sweet simple-minded assistant. And she makes her concierge (Yolande Moreau) believe that the womans long-dead philandering husband went to his death in love with her. The best of Amelies schemes -- one that appropriates an old urban legend -- is the one that isnt explained until the end. Stealing her fathers favorite garden gnome she arranges for her dad to receive a series of Polaroid snapshots of the gnome at the worlds most famous tourist spots. Seeing the hilarious shots of the gnome taking in the Statue of Liberty or the Sphinx Amelies father begins to realize what his daughter could never make him acknowledge the lonely restraints of his own housebound life. When we finally discover how Amelie has managed to get the shots its a good payoff. But the real pleasure of the running gag is the loopy notion of a jet-setting garden gnome happily mailing off holiday snaps. Jeunet has modeled the film on the 30s pictures where each Parisian neighborhood is a small village and all the inhabitants know each other. The movie has echoes of Carne and Preverts dada comedy ""Bizarre Bizarre"" and the delights of Rene Clair like the musical ""Le Million."" The trouble is that those movies achieved their charm with the simplest possible means (the smallness was part of the charm) and Jeunet is addicted to gimmickry. He fills the wide screen with bursts of light or a background giving way to a fantasy sequence while the dreamer remains in the foreground with zooms and cutting and odd angles. Its inventive gimmickry but it makes the sweetness a concocted thing rather than a natural outgrowth of the material and setting and mood. In Disneys new ""Monsters Inc."" its a joke when the film briefly plunks down in Paris and theres accordion music playing -- thats our movie-fed idea of Paris. But Jeunet uses the same music here without any irony an old-movie trick to evoke an old-movie response. You Might Also Like ""Amelie"" has been hailed as a valentine to Paris but what makes Jeunets wizardry so ill-suited to that tribute is the whole tradition of French film which located the enchantment of Paris in real settings. The 30s en plein air tradition of shooting on location was later taken up by the new wave directors of the 50s and 60s who took the camera out of the studios and into the streets. Theres more charm in the footage of the actual Parisian streets and cafes of Agnes Vardas ""Cleo From 5 to 7 (available beautifully remastered on a Criterion DVD) or to take more recent examples in Olivier Assayas ""Irma Vep"" or Jacques Rivettes ""Va Savoir"" than in all of ""Amelie."" Its hard to be charmed hard to think of a movie as a delightful trifle when youre so conscious of how hard the filmmakers are working to make it charming. I love the idea of ""Amelie"" and Im usually a sucker for movies where stray bits and pieces come together in unexpected ways. But ""Amelie"" never lets you forget that youre being played. It never lets you relax and sink into the fantasy. Its a little like eating at those restaurants where you find your napkin refolded whenever you come back from the restroom -- at some point such determined pampering becomes oppressive. The movies calculation extends to Audrey Tautou. Shes adorable all right but everything about her -- from her unkempt Louise Brooks bob to her perpetually big eyes which keep looking into the camera with conspiratorial mischievousness to the red slash of a mouth like that of a chaste coquette -- has been carefully designed to be adorable. The movie begins with flashes of Jeunets particular brand of black humor (particularly the manner of Amelies mothers death) and theres a great salty gag when Amelie now a young woman alone in Paris tries to imagine how many couples are having an orgasm at that moment. Jeunet gives us a razor-sharp whip-fast montage of couples of all ages and sizes reaching la petite mort turning the city into a happy cradle of oblivious ecstatic fucking. But the film quickly sheds any tendency toward black humor or sensuality in favor of its sexless pixie heroine. Why is it that the kids in ""The City of Lost Children"" -- the little girl with the knowing air of a doomed romantic heroine; the toddler who happily gobbled down whatever food he could lay his hands on a born sensualist; the wised-up tough little street kids -- were so decidedly unsappy and yet Amelie is meant to be wonderful because shes a wide-eyed little girl? The young man of Amelies dreams Nino (actor-director Matthieu Kassovitz) a fellow who collects discarded photo-booth snapshots into albums of random faces has been given a job as a clerk at an adult video store for seemingly no other reason than for Amelie to look shy and embarrassed when she walks into the place to find him. Much of the last section of the movie is made up of Amelies pursuit of Nino and its irritatingly pointless. Why does she lead him on a wild goose chase when shes clearly crazy about him? Watching her execute another step in the scavenger hunt shes devised for him is like seeing ""The Rules"" reimagined by Rube Goldberg. And am I the only one who finds Amelie just a tad creepy? When one of her schemes goes wrong the movie shies away from suggesting that maybe intervening in other peoples affairs can have unwanted consequences -- its not just Amelie thats blithely unaware of those consequences its Jeunet. Panning ""Amelie"" is probably the quickest way for a critic to get himself thought of as cynical and unfeeling. But ""Amelie"" can make you feel divided against yourself admiring of all the inventiveness thats gone into it even as the calculation of that charm holds you at arms length. Its not that I dont want to be charmed by a movie (right now a slice of genuine charm would be manna from heaven). I just dont want to be worked over prodded into being charmed. Its possible to make a movie about an innocent do-gooder that doesnt drown in sugary goodness. The 1935 ""The Good Fairy"" an adaptation of the Molnar play written by Preston Sturges directed by William Wyler and starring the heavenly Margaret Sullavan managed it (and I would bet that Jeunet and his co-screenwriter Guillame Laurant had that movie in mind as one of their models). ""Amelie"" has the weird effect of people who come up to you at a party and insist that you should have a good time. You might actually enjoy yourself if it just gave you some space.

USATODAY.com - Amelie engages with quirkiness Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 11/05/2001 - Updated 1049 AM ET Amelie engages with quirkiness By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Amelie (out of four) Stars Audrey Tautou Mathieu Kassovitz Claire Maurier Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet Distributor Miramax Films. Rating R for sexual content The charming Amelie already a hit in its native France is bound to capture American hearts and imaginations with its whimsical fable of random acts of kindness. Its color-drenched view of Paris and stylistic camera work is a visual treat. But the most engaging aspect is the performance of 23-year-old Audrey Tautou as a kindhearted shy waitress whose interior life is much more compelling than her day-to-day existence. After her mother dies and her father withdraws with grief Amelie retreats into solitude. Read more Related Breakout Audrey Tautou Amelie capturing worlds fancy Miramax already feels a tingle of Oscar buzz Video Amelie trailer But after discovering a box of childhood treasures hidden behind a loose brick in her wall and returning it to the rightful owner Amelie becomes intoxicated with the power of anonymously intervening in peoples lives. The movie becomes a modern-day fairy tale. Its heroine part cloistered princess and part knight in shining armor even bears a bit of a resemblance to Joan of Arc -- though she dresses in Doc Maartens and thrift-store fashions. And instead of battling she orchestrates -- behind-the-scenes and unbeknownst to the people involved. She inspires an elderly eccentric artist avenges the victim of a cruel bully spurs her father to take his first vacation and convinces a downcast widow that her philandering husband truly loved her. Inspired by an appreciation for senseless beauty she impulsively links her arm with that of a blind man and provides a running commentary on the sights around him then scampers off to perform more good deeds. But her focus on bettering the lives of others (some might call it meddling) keeps Amelie from facing her own growing loneliness. She exchanges glances in a Metro station with a handsome eccentric (Mathieu Kassovitz); he is intrigued but she lacks the confidence to approach him directly. Tautou is the very definition of gamine Her smile is impish her dark eyes resonate with warmth and sly intelligence and she has the coltish grace of a young Audrey Hepburn. Equally enchanting is director Jean-Pierre Jeunets Paris; his affection for his Montmartre neighborhood is palpable. We see it as Amelie the dreamer must see it -- a romanticized City of Light all dramatic skies and glimmering days. Composer Yann Tiersons evocative score is lovely lilting and bittersweet. Though its theme is distantly related to Pay It Forward and Chocolat Amelie is neither heavy-handed and downbeat like the former nor blandly predictable like the latter. Amelie is irresistibly endearing with a visual verve all its own.

In French with English subtitles. Running time 120 minutes. Rated R (several quick sex scenes). At the Paris and the Angelika. AMELIE"" is a slick sweet fast-paced feel-good romantic fantasy thats fairly irresistible if you can keep your cynicism in check for a couple of hours. Seeing ""Amelie"" again the other day I found that crucial suspension easier than when I first watched the film before Sept. 11. Its something I suspect I may have in common with a lot of other jaded New Yorkers who might previously have had difficulty staying with the films relentlessly precious magic realism. But now Amelie - played in a star-making performance by Audrey Tatou a saucer-eyed gamin with bobbed hair - has zutalors accidentally tapped into the zeitgeist. Amelie whose unhappy childhood is spelled out in elaborate (and sometimes hilarious) detail in the dazzling opening sequence is a shy 23-year-old whose life changes dramatically in the 48 hours following the death of Princess Diana in 1997. Finding a box of childrens toys hidden in her apartment Amelie arranges for the now middle-aged owner to rediscover them. That makes Amelie feel so good that she sets about improving other peoples lives including fixing up the cigarette girl with a customer at the cafe where the two women work and befriending an elderly recluse with fragile bones. She develops an elaborate ruse for drawing out her widowed father (the singularly named sour-faced Rufus) and plots to teach a lesson to a greengrocer who abuses his slow-witted assistant. An X-ray view literally shows Amelies heart aflutter when she bumps into Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz) a fellow obsessive-compulsive who collects discarded ID photographs from photo booths at train stations. Her ambivalent pursuit of him takes her into the porn store and amusement park where he holds part-time jobs. Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet best known in this country for the sci-fi sequel ""Alien Resurrection"" has elaborately constructed a love letter to an impossibly idealized Paris where cars have been digitally removed from the streets (and the citys multi-ethnic population is not in evidence). Though he pays homage to Truffauts ""Jules and Jim"" Jeunet (who co-wrote the screenplay with Giulliame Laurant) is clearly more influenced by the slam-bang visual pyrotechnics of Hollywood directors like Steven Spielberg than such stately French masters as Eric Rohmer. ""Amelie"" a huge box-office hit in France seems poised to take America - and possibly the Oscars - by storm. Even if Jeunets hyperkinetic visuals are so overwhelming that as my wife put it the movie is too much of a good thing.

"Mean Streak Hurts Amelie - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMovie Review Mean Streak Hurts AmelieDirector Jean-Pierre Jeunets attempted homage to 30s and 40s romances lacks genuine sweetness.November 02 2001|KENNETH TURAN | TIMES FILM CRITIC ""Amelie"" is what happens when a filmmaker with nasty habits tries to make nice. Its very much of a sometime thing.The filmmaker is Frenchman Jean-Pierre Jeunet responsible for the distinctly unpleasant trio of ""Alien Resurrection"" ""The City of Lost Children"" and ""Delicatessen"" (the last two with collaborator Marc Caro). ""I suddenly realized that Id never made a truly positive film"" Jeunet has explained. ""At this stage in my life in my career I wanted to make a sweet film one that makes people dream which gives them pleasure.""This is all very nice even laudable. The problem is just as Tina Turner explains in ""Proud Mary"" that shes frankly incapable of doing ""anything nice and easy"" Jeunet doesnt really have the sensibility to make the homage to the classic 1930s and 40s romantic celebrations of the little people of Paris that this is clearly intended to be.If those French films were poetic and affectionate ""Amelie"" features an aggressive in-your-face romanticism thats noticeably lacking in genuine warmth. While its story of lonely misfits searching for love has appealing moments more often it turns into an overbearing fable overburdened with fake joie de vivre.The problem starts with Jeunets jittery visual style his penchant for busy speeded-up camerawork (including frequent zoom-ins on characters) combined with a passion for slightly surreal occasionally off-putting imagery. For better or worse this is a film that will not leave you alone that is irritatingly insistent on pushing its hollow charm as if it were the real thing.Despite this ""Amelie"" has been a genuine phenomenon in France both critically and at the box office for reasons that wont necessarily be as potent in this country. For one thing the film appeals to a streak of cultural meanness that may be more French than American and its burlesquing of any number of standard French characters probably wont have the same resonance over here.The key to ""Amelies"" success however should have wide appeal and that is the performance of its charmer of a star Audrey Tautou. Winner of a Cesar for her work as the youngest beautician in ""Venus Beauty Institute"" the gifted Tautou plays Amelie as a kind of ultimate pixie complete with impish smile and huge ever-twinkling brown eyes.Jeunets film (which he co-wrote with Guillaume Laurant) opens with a brief look at Amelies childhood ""raised by a neurotic and an iceberg"" in a home so bleak a pet goldfish continually attempts suicide. All that makes Amelie so lonely that she retreats deeper and deeper into a fantasy life.As an adult Amelie works as a waitress in a Montmartre cafe called the Two Windmills thats filled with customary types the world-weary patroness a hypochondriac cigarette vendor another waitress hyper-jealous suitor and so on.Amelies apartment house is also exclusively populated by excessive characters. Theres the glass man (Serge Merlin) a shut-in with fragile bones who repaints a celebrated Renoir painting every year. Theres a weepy concierge (Yolande Moreau) still mourning a husband who ran off to South America with his girlfriend and Collignon (Urban Cancellier) a dyspeptic grocer who mistreats his long-suffering assistant.Amelies quasi-ordinary life changes one morning when she discovers a small box of childhood treasures in her apartment hidden there by a small boy some 40 years ago. She determines to return the cache to its rightful owner and rededicates her life to becoming a doer of increasingly complex good deeds for the downtrodden and woebegone.But fixing other peoples messy lives is also an excuse for Amelie to neglect her own. So even when she meets Nino (actor-director Mathieu Kassovitz) a fellow lonely recluse who spends his days re-assembling torn up and discarded snapshots from train station photo booths she flies from this potential romance at every turn. Not that it does her any good.Because Jeunet and company are working from time-tested models this sounds quite appealing and at times ""Amelie"" is as advertised. But in general this film thinks its doing things its not. Its spirit is as mocking as it is celebratory and its frozen heart is most engaged when its heroine takes sadistic revenge on an unpleasant character. ""Fifty million Frenchmen cant be wrong"" was a popular sentiment among American soldiers during World War I but times have changed. In this day and age maybe they can.MPAA rating R for sexual content.

"Amelie | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; amelie ) Amelie (France 2001) A movie review by James Berardinelli Years ago while watching Delicatessen (in 1992) and The City of Lost Children (in 1995) I wondered which of the co-directors Jean-Pierre Jeunet or Marc Caro was more responsible for the films quirky tone and striking visual style. Although Caro hasnt made a film since The City of Lost Children Jeunet has continued in the business accepting the Hollywood offer to helm Alien Resurrection then returning to his native France to direct Amelie. With the release of this movie which has won critical accolades across the world become one of the most popular home-grown films of all time in France and captured the audience award at the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival I have learned the answer to my question. Amelie makes it clear that the primary creative force behind the earlier films stylistic uniqueness was Jeunet. Like Tom Tykwers Run Lola Run Amelie is energized by instances of fast-cutting and unexpected inserts. We learn more about secondary characters than we need to know (a tongue-in-cheek voiceover for example lists their ""likes"" and ""dislikes"") and are the richer for the experience. Amelie works not just because it tells an interesting story about an affable character but because it does so in an involving and energetic manner that incorporates the right amount of comedy into the overall mixture. This motion picture proves that two hours can pass very quickly in a movie theater if whats being projected on screen truly deserves its running time. Amelie is about Amelie Poulain (Audrey Tatou) a young woman who has spent most of her life existing in the background. As a child she was discouraged from having friends by her neurotic mother and emotionally distant father. As an adult she works as a waitress in a cafA(c) and spends her nights alone in her small apartment. She has no boyfriend no confidantes and no real sense of purpose in life. But all that is about to change. One small event - the discovery of a box of old snapshots and toys in a hidden compartment in her apartment - causes her to take action. She sets out to find the owner of the box and her quest eventually leads him to reconcile with his son. Emboldened by her success Amelie decides to become a force for good in her small corner of the world helping others around her. In the process she encounters Nino Quincampoix (Mathieu Kassovitz) who may be her soulmate - if she can ever find the courage to talk to him face-to-face and admit her feelings for him. Amelie is a wonderfully uplifting motion picture that features a sparkling performance by Audrey Tautou in the lead role. Tautou brings Amelie to life with a delightful mix of shyness energy and mischievousness. It doesnt take long for Tautou to win our sympathy and once gained its something she never loses. It isnt difficult to understand why this movie has been such a success with audiences around the world - its the kind of motion picture thats both intelligent and immensely likable - just like the main character. Mathieu Kassovitz (the director of Hate) makes Nino an effective match for Amelie. Kassovitz underplays the part perfectly showing that Nino like Amelie is used to being in the background not the foreground. Also like Amelie Nino is shy about their relationship but he is determined to pursue it. Since she never approaches him directly but is content to leave him clues and anonymous messages he is forced into the role of detective and pursuer and Kassovitz displays the gradual strengthening of Ninos confidence and personality as events mature. Other supporting performers include Rufus (as Amelies father) Jeunet regular Dominique Pinon as a disgruntled customer at the cafA(c) where Amelie works and Serge Merlin as Amelies painter neighbor who gives her advice on life and love. One of the most intriguing aspects of the film aside from its visual vivaciousness is the manner in which Amelie chooses to help others. Rather than going about things in a straightforward manner she devises stratagems the complexities of which are analogous to the workings of a Rube Goldberg project. Her father has a hidden desire to travel so in order to bring his interest to the surface Amelie kidnaps his garden gnome and has it photographed in front of various geographical landmarks around the world. For a neighbor who cherishes old love letters from her dead husband Amelie fakes one that was ""recently found"". And so on... Throughout this movie Jeunet keeps us guessing whom Amelie will help next and how she will choose to do so. Voyerism is also a theme. Characters in this movie spend a lot of time watching. Amelie studies others before taking action. Nino keeps a scrap book of torn snapshots. And Amelies painter neighbor the ""Glass Man"" has not left his apartment for 20 years. He remains inside gazing out his window when he isnt copying a painting of Renoirs. In fact the Glass Mans choice to venerate Renoir adds another layer to the theme since the artist was once referred to as a ""professional voyeur"" who spent much time observing his subjects to understand them before committing their images to the canvas. Like Delicatessen and The City of Lost Children Amelie uses odd camera angles quick edits and other ""tricks"" to keep the movie visually dynamic. Recognizing that its easy for an audience to become bored by the repeated use of familiar shots Jeunet varies our diet without going so far overboard that it negatively impacts the viewing experienced. His approach proves to be stimulating and invigorating. Since this is a lighthearted drama (with occasional detours into absurd comedy) not a science fiction excursion there arent as many excesses as in the previous movies but anyone familiar with Jeunets previous work will immediately recognize the style. By shooting all around Paris Jeunet uses the city as more of a character than a mere backdrop although the directors surreal and timeless vision should not be confused with the place seen by tourists (or even ordinary citizens). This is Jeunets city where magic abounds in the strangest places where fate and predestination lurk around every corner where photographs talk and where one sprightly young woman can orchestrate small miracles. Amelies golden touch will even extend to Miramax Films - by releasing this movie in North America the distributor will restore some of the sheen to an image tarnished by its recent frequent embracing of subpar material.
