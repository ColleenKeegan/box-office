By Anthony Lane Angelina Jolie and Elle Fanning in the latest version of the Sleeping Beauty story.   Credit Illustration by Victor Melamed For centuries the myth of Sleeping Beauty has tossed and turned. In Charles Perraults version of 1697 the happy ending was not an ending at all; it led to an aftermath flavored with serial cannibalism writhing vipers and slit throats. Italo Calvino collecting Italian folktales dug up an old Calabrian variant in which the prince does not wake the heroine but rapes and impregnates her in her sleep. For some reason none of this made it into the Disney film of 1959. As for the fairy villain Perrault did not name her; nor did the Brothers Grimm in ""Little Briar-Rose"" their retelling of 1812. Disney however which never lost money by spelling things out called her Maleficent something of a giveaway you might think although the other characters seemed taken aback when she rolled up to the christening of the princess and started raging about spinning wheels and death instead of handing over a Tiffany feeding spoon and a couple of bibs from Bonpoint. No surprise then that like the Queen in ""Snow White"" or Cruella De Vil in ""101 Dalmatians"" she commandeered the story. But does she need a movie to herself? There is only one reason to see ""Maleficent"" but it is a very good reason indeed and that is Angelina Jolie. She takes the title role and plays with it--teasing out every strand of sadism defiance and ennui and perhaps reflecting on what further strands might have been available within a claws reach were this not another Disney production. Her speech is brisk and British with overtones of Kristin Scott Thomas and the icy abruptness with which she says ""Oh"" upon learning of the babys birth would not have disgraced the pages of Evelyn Waugh. On her back is a pair of enormous wings; finding them plucked off one morning she gives an overwhelming howl of loss and grief. More resilient are the curving horns on her head; at the screening I attended the audience was offered the plastic equivalent which I regretfully declined so as not to block the view of the person behind me. And they work only when teamed with satanically red lipstick which I didnt have on me at the time. Plus you need the cheekbones. Jolie has many co-stars. Sam Riley is her sidekick who can adopt the form of a dragon a raven or a wolf; Sharlto Copley is her nemesis the king of a neighboring land; and the part of Sleeping Beauty never easy goes to Elle Fanning whose expression tirelessly seraphic suggests that she is raising funds in a charity smile-a-thon. The contributor who matters most though is Rick Baker. He was the presiding genius of movie makeup in pre-digital days winning seven Oscars and anybody who saw Michael Jackson groove with the undead in ""Thriller"" was looking at Bakers handiwork. Jolies cheekbones which I thought were designed by Ferrari or Lockheed turn out to be Bakers invention and you feel them slicing through the softness of the film. Try stroking Maleficent on the face and youd wind up with bloody fingers. Children will not forget her in a hurry. Would that the rest of the movie followed suit. The rule is that Disney cartoons are mettlesome and taut whereas Disney live-action projects are a meandering mess; who would honestly choose ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" over ""Tangled"" or ""Frozen""? The director of ""Maleficent"" is Robert Stromberg and the screenplay is by Linda Woolverton who wrought her narrative magic on ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""The Lion King""; but having started the new movie at a trot they reach the baptismal curse and come to a juddering halt. The problem as with so many fairy tales is the weight of time. If you are Perrault or the Grimms you merely say ""Years passed"" and leap to the next enchanted event but ""Maleficent"" takes the risky decision to hang around for those years waiting for the princess to grow up and padding out numerous scenes with the doings of farcical fairies. The music by James Newton Howard gives little propulsion but then any composer is going to suffer next to Tchaikovsky whose ballet score was so unblushingly pinched by Disney in 1959. The result was orchestra-powered aided by the heraldic simplicity of the animation. The design of the new movie by contrast has that over-busy cram-every-corner relentlessness that infected Tim Burtons ""Alice in Wonderland"" in 2010 and Maleficents forest lair which should be a haven of ominous quietude is a pulsating traffic jam of tree monsters and trolls. Again it is Jolie who saves the day and brings on the night. There are wonderful shots of her emerald eyes gazing at the princess from the shadows all the creepier for being so calm. But why is she gazing? What has the movie done to her and to the armored gleam of her wickedness? The news is bleak Maleficent far from being arrested for stalking a minor begins to think better of her plans. Why she even takes a fancy to the noble little brat She might as well go the whole hog and change her name to Benevolent. Such a transformation would of course be wholly in line with the tender niceties on which unlike the Brothers Grimm we pride ourselves and ""Maleficent"" is hardly alone in its revisionist urge. I would wager that it sprang from a night at the theatre when a row of movie executives noted the crowds flocking to ""Wicked""--a musical about the good heart that beat inside the bad witch from ""The Wizard of Oz""--and dreamed of similar gold. Where this maddened hunt for backstories will lead I dread to think. Will the sisters in Disneys latest version of ""Cinderella"" already pencilled in for next year stay ugly to the end? Will the wolf help the three little pigs to build a communal living space eco-friendly and resistant to both huffs and puffs? The notion that evil can and should be redeemed not punished smacks of moral progress; but kids who like their villains to be vanquished may have other ideas. Set in Arizona in 1882 ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" stars Seth MacFarlane as Albert Stark. Albert is a poor sheep farmer with a yellow belly and limited prospects so its no surprise when his sweetheart Louise (Amanda Seyfried) leaves him for Foy (Neil Patrick Harris) a dandy with cash and a rococo mustache. Albert has a best friend Edward (Giovanni Ribisi) a God-fearing type who is betrothed to a prostitute named Ruth (Sarah Silverman). Also present are Liam Neeson as a black-hearted gunslinger called Clinch and Charlize Theron who plays Anna his long-suffering wife. So the cast is in fine shape; the grandeur of the landscapes is well caught by the cinematographer Michael Barrett with many a nod to John Ford; and the soundtrack by Joel McNeely kicks off with a big generous pastiche of an old-school Western theme. As it fades at the end of the opening credits the scene is set. Then the film happens. Here are some of the subjects with which it grapples death by flatulence the pains of anal sex (""Im going to rest my asshole"") and a hatful of diarrhea. Do you notice a common theme? Picture an entire movie spawned by the campfire scene from ""Blazing Saddles"" and youre almost there. All this will speak to your soul no doubt if you are a twelve-year-old boy who believes the bathroom to be the funniest place on earth but what about the rest of us? Fear not for MacFarlane--who co-wrote and co-produced the film as well as starring in it--has joys in store for those of more cultivated tastes. There are gags about retarded sheep Chinese immigrants the halitosis that follows a blow job and the precise appearance of the pudenda after a spell in the sex trade. As is his wont MacFarlane is daring us to be disgusted; and should we flinch his movie will mock us for being prim--the worst of all crimes in his scabrous world. But what if were just bored? Stuck in the foul mire are a few good scenes. I liked the idea that Edward and Ruth are chaste with each other saving themselves for marriage even while she is servicing fifteen clients a day; the joke keeps coming back however growing less amusing with each repeat. Thats the thing about running gags eventually they stagger and collapse. The same goes for the historical observations--the fact that nobody smiled in nineteenth-century photographs or Annas admission that she was a child bride because ""I just didnt want to end up like one of those fifteen-year-old spinsters."" Here we approach the nub of MacFarlanes argument his bold contention that in Annas words ""the West fucking sucks"" with its army of diseases its wretched life expectancy and what Albert calls its ""general depressing awfulness."" Yet what is most depressing about the film is not the low strike rate of its zingers or what Freudians will diagnose as its anal fixation so typical of the infant mind but the comic complacency. Albert may be spineless but that is nothing new; it is more than sixty years since Bob Hope put a coward among the cowboys in ""The Paleface."" And does Seth MacFarlane think that he is the first to notice how grim conditions were in the great drive westward that he alone can puncture the myth of that adventure or that his gang of neer-do-wells is the wildest bunch of all? Tell it to Sam Peckinpah.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

"Million Ways to Die in the West A | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; million-ways-to-die-in-the-west-a ) Million Ways to Die in the West A (United States 2014) May 31 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli It would be inaccurate to claim that A Million Ways to Die in the West is devoid of humor. It isnt. However Seth MacFarlanes hit-and-miss spoof of Westerns has far more ""misses"" than ""hits"" and the actor-director-writer (Ted) doesnt seem to realize that less is sometimes more when it comes to comedy. Too many of MacFarlanes jokes which are initially funny lose their luster because they go on too long or because the movie plumbs the same well too often. The running length is also an issue. A Million Ways to Die in the West feels like about 80 minutes of material was padded out to 110 minutes. The comedy standard by which all Western parodies are measured remains Mel Brooks Blazing Saddles. Although age has robbed it of some of its humor the laugh-aloud moments are intact including the classic campfire scene. On some level Im sure MacFarlane was trying to recreate the chemistry (although not the specifics) of Blazing Saddles but he doesnt succeed. The comedy is a weird amalgamation of the clever and the gross with Monty Python-esque moments warring with graphic sex-and-poop material. The film uses over-the-top farce to call out the stupidity of various flavors of racism (blacks Jews Muslims) and features a raft of cameos (two of which are brilliant). A lot of the raunchiest material which features Sarah Silverman as a prostitute who doesnt believe in premarital sex becomes tiresome after a while. The screenplay has been constructed to accommodate the humor which isnt unusual for a comedy. The main character Albert is played by MacFarlane whose mannerisms make him as annoying as a protagonist can be. Hes an inept gunslinger who eventually ends up in a gunfight with the deadly outlaw Clinch Leatherwood (Liam Neeson). As usual theres a woman involved. In this case its Anna (Charlize Theron) who loves Albert but is married to Clinch. Amanda Seyfried is Alberts big-eyed ex-girlfriend and Neil Patrick Harris is a guy with a nice mustache. (The mustache is so nice it gets its own musical number.) Aside from the cameos some of the cleverest elements of A Million Ways to Die in the West relate to technical elements. The photography by Michael Barrett makes full use of the setting echoing the vistas we have come to expect from Westerns. The musical score by Joel McNeely is a pastiche of almost-familiar tunes from about a half-dozen old movies. At times theyre so close to the originals that you can almost hum along with them. All this is window dressing for a movie that doesnt deserve it but its very nice window dressing. As far as the actors are concerned Liam Neeson seems to be having fun hamming it up as the villain - a role he rarely gets to play. Charlize Theron is appealing as the love interest/mentor. MacFarlane is too busy being MacFarlane for any kind of character to emerge although to his credit he does allow himself to be the butt of a few nasty jokes (such as a scene in which he is urinated on by a sheep). Everyone else is pretty much wasted although no one who sees this movie is going to forget Neil Patrick Harris (perhaps not for the right reasons). Comedy is subjective but A Million Ways to Die in the West consistently tries too hard to sell its humor. The funniest movies are usually the ones in which the jokes flow easily and theres a sense of spontaneity about their delivery. In A Million Ways to Die in the West too many gags are labored repetitive or predictable. There are enough high points sprinkled throughout to make the movie of passable value to MacFarlane fans. Others however are likely to be unimpressed offended or just plain bored.

"Toil and Trouble << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous Numbers Rarely Lie  Next The B.S. Report Jimmy Kimmel Facebook Twitter Print Movies Toil and Trouble Angelina Jolie redeems Maleficent and Charlize Theron almost saves A Million Ways to Die in the West by Wesley Morris on May 30 2014 The ads for Maleficent promise quality time with one of Disneys most evil animated queens. Who knows why we need the reintroduction? Who knows why wed want to see Angelina Jolie interpret the role? In Sleeping Beauty Maleficent is a party pooper a fairy with horns and a scepter who barges into a newborn princesss christening so annoyed that no one invited her that she curses the baby to live 16 years then prick her finger and die. Shes a bitch. That movie was released in 1959 about a decade or so after the popularity of the great dames of classical Hollywood -- the Bette Davises Joan Crawfords and Rosalind Russells -- had peaked. Maleficent was a perversion of their steeliness and hauteur and lighting. All of that legendary indomitability was given the cartoon treatment. But the Disney animator Marc Davis and the actress Eleanor Audley made Maleficent iconic. They gave her the domineering carriage and self-possession of a great movie persona while telling the story of stardoms nightmare -- of Daviss Margo Channing and Gloria Swansons Norma Desmond.1 Davis drew a lot of the enduring Disney characters including Cruella de Vil which pretty much makes him the John Singer Sargent of batshit-crazy shrews. By 1959 popular movies belonged in part to princesses virgins and dolls -- your Grace Kellys Doris Days Sandra Dees and Marilyn Monroes. Increasingly it was also the province of color specifically blonde. The black-and-white hustlers and hussies of the classical era had become harpies and harridans. Elizabeth Taylor stood virtually alone as a big star with some of the movies fading authority. A dozen years after All About Eve Davis and Crawford were fire-breathing gorgons together in What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? The evil-queen type was a cartoon consecration of what an audience feared lurked in strong womens souls a black hole. In the last three years there seems to be some kind of reconsideration of these fairy tales an attempt to extract a contemporary allegory from whats basically princess fable. Julia Roberts (Mirror Mirror) and Charlize Theron (Snow White and the Huntsman) both played the evil queen as jokes on Hollywood myths of beauty and youth. Roberts blew all of the evil from the part and went for self-amused stress. Theron dove into tortured hotness. But it was saddening either way. These are essentially petty hag parts that two famous actresses were playing as if they were Shakespeare. Female villainy in these movies comes from a kind of insecurity but the films are structured only for comeuppance. Why the queen curses and casts spells doesnt matter. Just finish her Both Snow White movies were in some way also about older actors ceding the floor to younger actors -- Roberts to a missing-in-action Lily Collins; Theron to Kristen Stewart. It just seemed too soon for what essentially felt like a concession. I say just do the Shakespeare. Like a lot of films since The Little Mermaid both movies also wanted to address the ""princess problem."" They wanted to turn the princesses into tough cookies. There is feminism in these movies but its on crutches. Their most appealing ingredient isnt the ingenue but the hatefully jealous older star. Thats the hook for Maleficent too Come watch Angelina Jolie be awful to Princess Elle Fanning. Jolie hasnt appeared in theaters since 2010 with Salt and The Tourist which means she hasnt been in an (arguably) good film since Changeling in 2008. So the invitation to watch a star who has always struck me as canny about her image fall into the evil-queen trap seemed like one that should be refused. But Jolie knows what shes doing. Its as if she has seen the cartoons and the attempts to redress princess politics and deduced that whats been missing is feminism that can stand on its own two feet -- that whats been missing is her. She makes this movie something to see. I might feel that way even if she acted more than she does but her return from a prolonged absence only enhances the mystique of a star we only think we know. In Maleficent she arrives a happy airborne fairy with antelope horns gargoyle wings and high digitally adjusted cheekbones that Henry Moore couldve sculpted. Theres a war on between humans and woodland creatures. Shes the commander and vanquishes the kings forces. As a girl Maleficent befriends a human boy named Stefan who dreams of living in the royal castle. And as a man (Sharlto Copley) he becomes so mad for power that when the king falls ill and asks for proof of Maleficents death Stefan betrays his old friend to secure the throne. He steals Maleficents wings. And Jolie aided by the hysterics of James Newton Howards score wails in anguish. When King Stefans daughter Aurora is born Maleficent crashes the christening in a helmet and cape and puts the baby under that ridiculous spell. Three dingbat pixies (Imelda Staunton Lesley Manville and Juno Temple) disguise themselves as peasants and raise the baby in a cottage outside the kingdom while Maleficent hangs back and plays pranks on them all. The movies screenplay is credited to Linda Woolverton whos been writing scripts for Disney since Beauty and the Beast. Its as if she has fused Game of Thrones with different versions of Sleeping Beauty -- by Charles Perrault the Brothers Grimm and Disney. The result doesnt make any sense. The other iterations did -- more than Maleficent does anyway. But theres a method to the writings badness. To tinker with the politics of the story the movie has chosen to tie itself in a dramatic knot Theres really no conflict between Maleficent and Aurora whom Fanning plays as a carefree teenager. The girl loves the woman who learns to love her back. Its King Stefan and his army who have it out for Maleficent. (Copleys become the most elastic embodiment of nastiness; its never the same villainy twice with him.) She seems perfectly killable but they try chaining her up. For sport. For torture. On the one hand its perfectly obvious what Maleficent is up to. But considering how flagrantly the movies have gone out of their way to celebrate misogyny this one might have too much subtlety to be construed as blatantly feminist. Although by the time Aurora discovers what her father once did to her surrogate mother what else could this movie be? Frozen does more with similar ideas (coldness and innocence and the resuscitative power of love) and without any of the defensiveness. Boys like that movie not because its feminist per se but because its fun. The feminism just looks like the way it is. Maleficents director Robert Stromberg is an effects artist and designer making his first movie and revisionism is almost all he has. Some of the silhouettes and production-design ideas have the exciting ominousness of silent-era expressionism. But the movie doesnt work -- as a tract or as entertainment -- without Jolie. While her stardom has come almost entirely from her years of shooting at people on the run this is Jolie in a new mode. Theres a vibrancy here thats new for her. Over a year ago the news broke that she underwent a preventive double mastectomy. I dont want to overemphasize a connection between that decision and a reconsideration of her onscreen femininity but here she is using one of those Hollywood contraptions to capture another dimension of her own womanliness. And shes extraordinary. This is studiously calibrated respectfully edited movie-star acting.  There isnt a false close-up or cutaway. Theres barely any camp. Shes personalized her acting. You watch her screaming because of Maleficents stolen wings and think for a moment about Jolies surgery and her six children and the movie she directed in Bosnia. She had to do all that living in order to reinterpret an angel of death. Good parts turn her solemn. Shes better in crap. If we accept that theres something formative in exposure to so many princesses shouldnt it hold that for generations of moviegoers theres also something damagingly formative about the evil-queen experience? Jolie is the perfect star to address the problem. Shes of the Faye Dunaway school -- pitched somewhere between Network and Supergirl. Dunaway herself was of the Crawford school having played her in Mommie Dearest a career-immolating evil-queen part that makes the queen Crawford co-inspired for Snow White seem like Shirley Temple. Jolie seems to know the history and feel a duty to correct it. You feel a little absurd being moved by something as shoddily put together as this. But it likes these women -- even the nincompoop pixies. It believes in its star. There are a couple of scenes in which Fanning looks at Jolie with radiant admiring affection you can feel. Shes not looking at an evil queen. Shes gazing at a superhero. Charlize Theron went through a Dunaway phase. In two years she played three bitches in Young Adult that Snow White movie and Prometheus. She was so good that you got nervous that producers and the studios wouldnt let her do anything else. But there she is next to Seth MacFarlane in A Million Ways to Die in the West cracking up. What hes said isnt that funny but the sight of her tipped over in laughter is contagious. It feels genuine. The movie is as much an attempt at a repair job of MacFarlanes reputation among women as Maleficent is a revision of women in fables. Who knows what the ladies will say? But it works more often than it doesnt. MacFarlane has taken the canvas of a Western and graffitied it with farce feces and 21st-century sitcommery. If Mad Magazine wrote an Albert Brooks movie directed by Life Stinks-era Mel Brooks itd go something like this. When a big baddie (Liam Neeson) grabs his wife (Theron) and tells her to show him some respect in front of his men she rolls her eyes and drones ""Oh my god I love you. Im like the luckiest girl in the history of girls."" The movie which MacFarlane directed and cowrote with Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild is clever about its anachronisms. You stay surprised. Sarah Silverman turns tricks in a brothel but she wont have sex with her long-suffering dimwitted (but not stupid) boyfriend (Giovanni Ribisi) because its not the custom. Silverman puts as much air and mock earnestness as she can into her lines while Ribisi spends the movie taking her at her word. Their exchanges are funnier than anything in Ted MacFarlanes previous outing as a director. That movie made a fortune toying with the incongruities of indecency and innocence. But it was cheap and lazy and foully violent. The Old West sheep farmer MacFarlane plays Albert gets dumped and his girlfriend (Amanda Seyfried) starts seeing the owner (Neil Patrick Harris) of the local mustache-grooming shop. (Albert doesnt have a mustache because itd cost too much to take care of.) When the baddies wife Anna shows up and befriends Albert they use their brand-new friendship to make his ex jealous. The intercouple bickering leads to the best scene in the movie a musical number at a barn dance with a song built around the word ""mustache"" whose tune I still remember. MacFarlane has the ingenuity for a whole movie of scenes like that. At 40 hes also got the face of an 11-year-old and the voice of a good FM-radio DJ. His hair in this movie shoots up in the front like Astro Boys. Albert spends the movie exasperatingly pointing out the horrors of life in the West and remains guiltless anytime something disgusting happens like when a block of ice crushes a mans head. Hes like Woody Allen and Albert Brooks a charmingly self-deprecating guide to absurdity. Its a trick but it suits MacFarlane. You get why Theron would go for him. Hes got a Brady Bunch cleanliness. The world saw this even as the Oscars were tanking MacFarlanes got something. But hes also a comedian always looking for a line to cross. When he Theron and Harris play a carnival game called Runaway Slave complete with a sambo caricature biting into a watermelon the line is leapt over and the smirking crassness almost sours the rest of the movie. That comedy of randomness becomes a liability What awfulness is next? The carnival game is the one transgression from which MacFarlane doesnt distance himself. Its also one that youd like to think liberal-minded Albert would have grandstanded against given a long sequence later on with Wes Studi as an American Indian chief. The movie tries to make amends during the closing credits when the (very famous) actor who makes a cameo shows up at a carnival with a gun. He shouldve just handed it to MacFarlane so he can finish shooting himself in the foot. The wicked queen in Disneys first full-length animated movie 1937s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was loosely inspired by Crawford.

LOREY SEBASTIAN BY MICHAEL SRAGOW / MOVIE CRITIC Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF A Million Ways to Die in the WestStarring Seth MacFarlane Charlize Theron Liam Neeson Amanda Seyfried Sarah Silverman Neil Patrick Harris Giovanni Ribisi Directed by Seth MacFarlane Rated R for strong crude and sexual content language throughout some violence and drug material Running time 1 hour 56 minutes Playing In wide release (See theaters and movie times)The quick hitEgregiously over-long and only sporadically funny Seth MacFarlanes comic Western mixes loving frontier re-creations with parodies on the sub-Mad level of the old Cracked magazine. Grade C In ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" director-star Seth MacFarlane builds an imposing affectionate reconstruction of the American movie West then defaces it with funny mustaches - often literally. The secondary villain a dandy named Foy played by Neil Patrick Harris in his Tonys mode runs a ""moustachery"" in Old Stump Arizona circa 1882. He sports a classic mustache himself - Id call it a modified Snidely Whiplash. Sustaining it with oils and tools as a sign of wealth and status is just one notion that MacFarlane harps on long after its humor has expired. He even writes a song about mustaches and showcases it in a barn dance. The ad line for the forthcoming Tom Cruise sci-fi vehicle ""The Edge of Tomorrow"" - ""Live. Die. Repeat."" - could summarize the comedy in ""A Million Ways to Die in the West."" The mustache gags get a workout because Foy steals the purtiest gal in Old Stump a fetching schoolmarm named Louise (Amanda Seyfried) from the arms of the hero Albert a frustrated peace-loving sheep farmer (played by MacFarlane himself). Albert keeps proclaiming how much he loathes the frontier for its danger violence and crudity. As a director MacFarlane is equally primitive (his one previous film was the dirty-teddy-bear frolic ""Ted""). The movie often turns into an illustrated gag book - ""Jokes for the Western John"" - while MacFarlane plays ""can you top this?"" with tales of barbaric frontier ways like the doctor prescribing a blue jay to peck the blood out of a wound. Hes peculiarly inept about marrying visual and verbal humor or bringing momentum to a gag. Hes best with one-offs like the fleeting startling sight of an un-sheared sheep as a stumbling hill of fleece. MacFarlanes idea of building to a payoff is for Albert to complain about the doctor and then actually go to this wacky medic for his blue-jay treatment. As a writer (with Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild) MacFarlane concocts a flimsy burlesque story that draws on every offbeat oater from ""Destry Rides Again"" to ""Cat Ballou"" and ""Django Unchained."" After Albert saves the life of a lovely stranger Anna (Charlize Theron) during a bar fight she persuades him to stick around for the annual fair if only to fascinate Louise when she sees Anna on Alberts arm. The audience knows that Anna is married to fearsome gunslinger Clinch (Liam Neeson) wholl be coming for her. She and Albert fall in love anyway as she teaches him skills for one gunfight (with Foy) that come in handy for another (with Clinch). The running jokes in this movie are really diarrhetic - and not just when they focus on diarrhea. MacFarlane intersperses the central love story with the romance of a cobbler Edward (Giovanni Ribisi) and a plucky up-for-anything prostitute Ruth (Sarah Silverman). Expect recurrent bits about the gap between their sweet courtship and Ruths career and her refusal to have premarital sex with Edward no matter what she does on the clock. Even Silverman cant enliven a one-note part. Her slyest bit comes when she argues for premarital purity by proclaiming ""Were Christians"" As an actor MacFarlane casts a tiny shadow. His handsome features are oddly inexpressive; early on he looks as dead-eyed and immobile as the people in ""Clutch Cargo"" which superimposed moving human mouths on still cartoon faces. Theron at least warms him up. She finds a flexible nice-and-easy style to modulate the films helter-skelter blend of hyperbole anachronism and rugged authenticity. Unfortunately its not enough to make you root for them as lovers - Anna seems too good for Albert. What keeps you watching is wondering what archetypal scenes the film will resurrect beyond the barn dance bar fight and shootout. This movie is more secondhand and far more uncomplicated and nostalgic than any Mel Brooks movie - partly because its such a straightforward salute to Brooks ""Blazing Saddles."" When Brooks staged the farting scene in ""Blazing Saddles"" he was answering the question ""What effect did eating tons of beans have on your average cowboy?"" In ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" MacFarlane uses farts as punctuation. Too bad they didnt give off laughing gas.

By Peter Rainer Film critic May 30 2014 Save for later Saved A Million Ways to Die in the West stars Amanda Seyfried (l.) Neil Patrick Harris (second from l.) Seth MacFarlane (second from r.) and Charlize Theron (r.). Lorey Sebastian/Universal Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of If you measure a comedy by how many times you laughed Seth MacFarlanes ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" at least for me is a middling success. If you measure a comedy by how many misfires it has then this  film is a failure. Its a hit-or-miss extravaganza - a western spoof that tries to make ""Blazing Saddles"" look tame by comparison. In more ways than one MacFarlane is trying to outgross Mel Brooks.This is not to put it mildly an exalted ambition. After all if youve heard one fart joke youve heard em all. (There are a million ways to do more than die in this film.) And MacFarlane in his first leading live-action role is such a weightless presence that he blands out almost every scene hes in. Hes playing Albert a cowardly sheep farmer in 1882 Arizona whose girlfriend (Amanda Seyfried) has just dumped him for the towns scurvy mustache-grooming magnate (Neil Patrick Harris). But true love beckons in the hourglass form of Anna (Charlize Theron) a moll masquerading as an upstanding new neighbor but who is in fact married to the territorys most vicious gunslinger (Liam Neeson). Theron gives this movie its (sole) touch of class. Recommended The 25 best movie comedies of all time MacFarlane also produced directed and co-wrote this film so you cant say he was just a hired hand. I wasnt a big fan of ""Ted"" one of the smash comedies of recent years but it was more irreverent than ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" which even when its making icky jokes about a saloon prostitute (Sarah Silverman) is curiously chaste. MacFarlanes talent - or at least his appeal - is that he gift-wraps scurrility as wholesome family entertainment. The 25 best movie comedies of all time Monitor Movie Guide My tolerance for gross-out humor is higher than the average pointy-headed critics and out of self-preservation I have trained myself to take my pleasures where I find them in these lumpy jamborees. But maybe we would all be better off if we simply sat through a best-moments trailer instead.

Comments (1) click to enlarge A Million Ways to Die in the West Video Rated R  116 minutes  2014 Granted theres modern-day slang in Blazing Saddles (1974) which many would call the greatest western comedy ever. But what does it say about a writer-director when all the other people on his team--the location scouts the production designer the costume designer the props manager the title designer--strive for period authenticity while the boss lazily tells his story in like totally whatever dialogue? Despite all the costumes stunt work and locations in Monument Valley this big-budget western spoof by Seth MacFarlane (Ted Foxs Family Guy) is too glib to live up to its potential. MacFarlane has a solid comic angle scoring numerous laughs off the brutal living conditions of the old west but his hyperactive riffing as the hero emulated by Charlize Theron as his love interest tends to spoil any jokes that dont involve urine semen horse manure or diarrhea.

Or just call it icky. As the bawdy hitmaker of TVs Family Guy and the film Ted writer-director Seth MacFarlane gets a lot of that. Gags about farts STDs and violent pooping inspire haters. But for all its hit-and-miss jokes there are lots of ways to die laughing at this Western raunchfest. Its 1882 but MacFarlane in his first major acting role (he usually sticks to voices) is every inch the modern smartass as Albert Stark a wussy sheep farmer whose GF (Amanda Seyfried) dumps him for a fop (Neil Patrick Harris). Albert falls for newcomer Anna (Charlize Theron) but shes married to a scary villain Clinch Leatherwood (Liam Neeson). Complications nearly get Albert killed. MacFarlane following a trail blazed by Bob Hope Mel Brooks and Woody Allen plays himself leaving the heavy lifting to others notably a sweetly funny Theron. The surprise is how terrific the movie looks and sounds with its handsome vistas (thats the real Monument Valley) and Joel McNeelys rousing score. MacFarlane has an eye and a feel for Westerns.

Thats deftly evoked in an early gag in which inept sheepherder Albert (MacFarlane) gestures to a corpse on the street and explains that its the mayor killed several days before and never moved now fodder for wolves. There are also good bits about the absence of smiles in old photographs a nice play on words involving horse shit and funny cameos by characters from other movies (though not alas by Mel Brooks who ought by rights to be here). Otherwise MacFarlane serves up over-the-top gore expulsive diarrhea Sarah Silvermans vagina and A-list actors dressed like Western archetypes against glorious wide-screen vistas using dirty words. The thinking must have been Add ""fuck"" to a line and its har-dee-har-har. MacFarlane got by with a foul-mouthed giant teddy bear in Ted no small thanks to straight man Mark Wahlberg and his dopey deadpan. He puts himself in the center of A Million WaysA ... and looks like a bland last-minute replacement for a comedian on the level of Bob Hope or even Don Knotts both of whom took a turn trying to twirl a six-shooter under the tutelage of a foxy female gunfighter. Here the gal is Charlize Theron who plays the wife of a ghoulishly cruel Irish outlaw (Liam Neeson playing it straight) in town to scout out the banks. Naturally she finds herself drawn to MacFarlane because hes such a sweet sensitive empathetic male. Thats a good one MacFarlane as a proto-feminist. Bob Hope leering at Jane Russells boobs felt more progressive. The other stars? Amanda Seyfried wanders in under a lot of blonde ringlets as the shallow bitch who spurns MacFarlane because he wont shoot anyone leaving him for Neil Patrick Harris as the wax-mustachioed owner of a mustache emporium. Its Harris who gets the expulsive diarrhea how nice for him. Giovanni Ribisi is the tender virgin affianced to prostitute Silverman who screws ten men a day and has a butthole sore from overuse but wont have sex with Ribisi because ""Were Christian."" This is the umpteenth terrible role for Silverman who plays stupid instead of her specialty which is brilliantly stupid. Native Americans -- hell lets call them what they are in this context ""Injuns""--show up to crack wise in subtitles and pass MacFarlane the wacky bowl. A What saddens me most about A Million Ways to Die in the West is that I was primed to love it and the opening widescreen blood-red credits made me even giddier with expectation. Some of the gags do land -- maybe one in four. But the genre-parody genre with big stars and poop jokes needs a little more class than MacFarlane is capable of providing.

Dave McGinn The Globe and Mail Published Friday May 30 2014 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday May 30 2014 1228PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Seth MacFarlane Written by Seth MacFarlane Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild Starring Seth MacFarlane Charlize Theron and Liam Neeson Classification R Country USA Language English Seth MacFarlane has honed a potty-brained quick-fire style of comedy in his animated television shows Family Guy and American Dad. Even if you dont like the 40-year-olds humour and many dont you can at least appreciate its gleefully juvenile craft - scenes chockablock with sight gags rapid-fire cutaways to hilariously absurd punchlines painfully awkward pauses that last so long you eventually laugh all of it wrapped in an encyclopedic knowledge of pop culture that has made him a bro deity among the coveted 18- to 34-year-old male demographic. So its disappointing and more than a little confusing that his sophomore feature film is so plodding and lazy.The success of Ted his feature directorial debut starring Mark Wahlberg as a man who smokes pot with a living foulmouthed teddybear which earned more than 500-million worldwide guaranteed that MacFarlane could do anything he wanted with his follow-up film.Apparently inspired by Mel Brookss much funnier Blazing Saddles MacFarlane chose to make a comic western.MacFarlane stars as Albert a cowardly sheep farmer trying to make it in the harsh life of the frontier in 1882. After chickening out of a gunfight his girlfriend Louise (Amanda Seyfried) dumps him for Foy the smarmy owner of the Moustachery played by Neil Patrick Harris.Thankfully a fearsome gunslingers wife named Anna (Charlize Theron) shows up in town to teach Albert how to shoot and maybe just maybe find his inner confidence. Hell need it for when the gunslinger Clinch Leatherwood (Liam Neeson) shows up ready to kill the varmint whos been romancing his lady.Meanwhile Alberts buddy Edward (Giovanni Ribisi) is patiently dating the town prostitute (Sarah Silverman). Theyre Christians so theyre waiting to have sex.Theres plenty of poop jokes fart jokes and penis jokes none of them all that funny. Theres also a runaway slave shooting gallery which shows MacFarlanes willingness to offend.Amazingly theres only one really good pop-culture reference. It involves a weather machine but I wont ruin it.As is clear from the movies title there are indeed innumerable ways to die on the frontier a block of ice snapping loose and crushing a man a bull charging out of nowhere even a photograph can kill.The laziness of the storytelling however is clear from the beginning. A gravelly voiceover introduces the film and is never heard from again; the debt Albert promised to pay off to get out of his first gunfight is somehow paid although how is never made clear; a gash Albert gets on his forehead disappears the day later.Most unforgivably of all to anyone familiar with MacFarlanes usual rapid-fire comic pacing is the long stretches without any jokes at all or little more than tired ones.Yes there are a million ways to die in the west. Boredom shouldnt be one of them.

By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 1033pm on Thursday May. 29 2014 Thursday May. 29 2014 Thursday May. 29 2014 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram If there were a high-noon shootout in the Hollywood comedic corral between Mel Brooks 40-year-old Western spoof Blazing Saddles and the new kid in town Seth MacFarlanes A Million Ways to Die in the West its not even a contest. Brooks classic would chase the upstart out of town with a backside full of lead.Speaking of backsides the two films do have one thing in common flatulence jokes. But thats pretty much where the similarities end.Thats not to say there arent some very humorous segments in A Million Ways to Die (in a comedy that stretches to nearly two hours there ought to be). There are also some inspired cameos. But it lacks the raw anarchic spirit that made Blazing Saddles so ferociously funny. It substitutes that with a sense of sweetness as well as MacFarlanes Family Guy-style one-liners which as anyone who saw his stint as host of the 2013 Oscars or his last film the foul-mouthed teddy bear flick Ted can attest can be hit-or-miss.Its the 19th century and MacFarlane is Albert a luckless sheep farmer living with his parents in the dusty town of Old Stump in the Arizona Territory. His only friend is the equally hapless Edward (Giovanni Ribisi) a virgin dating the town prostitute Ruth (Sarah Silverman) who wont be intimate with Edward until he puts a ring on it.Meanwhile Alberts girlfriend Louise (Amanda Seyfried) has left him for a local lothario Foy (Neil Patrick Harris) the man with the most upper-lip facial hair for miles who also runs the towns moustachery. Their lives are disrupted when during a bar brawl Albert happens to save the life of a beautiful but mysterious woman Anna (Charlize Theron) who just moved to Old Stump.Despite the fact that shes an angel and hes a nebbish the two hit it off. But she fails to tell him one important fact Shes married to the most feared outlaw in the West a mean cuss who goes by the name of Clinch (Liam Neeson). Hes on his way to town and is not going to appreciate a varmint like Albert getting cozy with his woman.Theron brings an enjoyable sense of ease to her part while Harris (who has the most memorable -- and scatalogical -- scene in the film) Ribisi and Silverman seem like theyre having a frontiers worth of fun. But MacFarlane might have been better off casting someone else to play Albert. He never disappears into his character; hes just Seth MacFarlane in a cowboy hat spouting lines that are more 21st-century Hollywood than 19th-century Tombstone saloon. No doubt thats part of the joke but it wears thin after awhile.Plus some of the jokes -- like the runaway-slave shooting gallery at the county fair -- induce more groans and winces than laughs. (Though to be fair viewers need to stay through to end of the movie for a cameo appearance that makes that routine work. Sort of.)Visually the film is ravishing -- it was actually filmed in Santa Fe N.M. and at Monument Valley in Utah -- conjuring up John Ford-like purple-mountains-majesty visions of the American West. MacFarlane definitely needs to thank his cinematographer Michael Barrett.Overall though A Million Ways to Die in the West is just not very memorable. Neither offensive enough to be shocking nor funny enough to compensate for its weaknesses it stands in a fallow middle ground out in the open just waiting to be picked off by the next Hollywood gunslinger with a few jokes in his saddlebag.

Even straight-faced and sincere revisionists -- I see you Coen Brothers and Quentin Tarantino -- cant help but wink at the dusty form at this late date.But usually a filmmaker feels compelled to drape even casually a narrative around that sturdy if rusty frame. Not Seth MacFarlane the Family Guy whose Million Ways to Die in the West is little more than a two-hour dirty joke told by a guy whos seen some Westerns but never really felt them. Its clear what hes aiming for The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance riding on Blazing Saddles. Only he winds up shooting himself in the foot.MacFarlanes Albert Stark is a cowardly sheep farmer -- ""not a quivering jittery weak-kneed sort of a coward"" MacFarlane writes in the novelization ""but the kind who viewed his cowardice as an act of sensibility."" But Alberts not much of any kind of character Hes just Seth MacFarlane moaning about Westerns and their inhabitants from the sidelines while pretending not to be the hero he desperately wants to be.Cleavon Little was an anachronism in Blazing Saddles the hipster sheriff duded up in all-leather finery. MacFarlanes more like a time traveler -- Bruce Campbell in Army of Darkness or Michael J. Fox in Back to the Future Part III which is actually referenced here -- cracking wise about all the stupidity that surrounds him. ""We live in a terrible place and time"" MacFarlane says before he spends two hours explaining why over and over. Meanwhile the fine folk of 1882 Old Stump Ariz. are done in by butcher doctors exploding cameras blocks of ice stampeding bulls and the random bullet.Occasionally hell squeeze in another character like Giovanni Ribisi as Edward Alberts only friend and the God-fearing husband of a good-Christian prostitute (played by Sarah Silverman oy) wholl have noisy sloppy sex with everyone except Edward. Or Charlize Theron as Anna the good-hearted wife of outlaw Clinch Leatherwood (Liam Neeson as the best gun and worst pun in the West) who teaches Albert how to shoot straight. Or Neil Patrick Harris as Foy the foppish owner of the towns upscale mustachery who steals Alberts gal (Amanda Seyfried).But the down-for-anything cast along with a handful of welcome cameos cant prop up its weakest link Seth MacFarlane.He directed the movie co-wrote it produced it and appears in almost every scene -- good news for those who wanted more MacFarlane after his cant-you-people-take-a-joke stint as Oscars host last year. Without anyone to rein him in youre left with a wildly overlong movie (there might be seven minutes worth of jokes tops) an abundance of expletives (just because) and gross-out jokes involving every imaginable bodily fluid (human and animal).Mel Brooks had his campfire. Seth MacFarlane has a diarrheal Neil Patrick Harris filling two cowboy hats during a shootout. My how far weve come. A MILLION WAYS TO DIE IN THE WEST (C-)Directed by Seth MacFarlane.

"Review A Million Ways to Die in the West shoots self in foot - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review A Million Ways to Die in the West shoots self in foot A Million Ways to Die in the West Universal Pictures A scene from ""A Million Ways to Die in the West."" A scene from ""A Million Ways to Die in the West."" (Universal Pictures) So Seth MacFarlane Thought you could hold your own against Charlize Theron did you? If Seth MacFarlanes ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" accomplishes nothing else it proves beyond doubt the adage that dying is easy -- as promised in the title -- its comedy thats hard.Deadly jokes certainly dog this latest bit of ridiculous raunch from the Hollywood whiz kid who falls flat on his face many times over the course of the film On the main drag of the frontier town of Old Stump. Eating the dust of the Arizona plains where the film is set. On the sheep farm he runs -- and at times under the sheep or more specifically under peeing sheep. And in one comedy riff after another. MacFarlane is a very funny dude and there are times ""A Million Ways to Die"" is indeed funny. But too often the movie feels half-baked. Its as if the troika behind the surprisingly satisfying satire of 2012s trash-talking plush bear ""Ted"" -- MacFarlane Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild -- are still in the writers room working out the beats for ""West.""The filmmaker is lucky to have such a swell cast one game for the various humiliations visited upon them to get those laughs. Led by Oscar-winning actress Charlize Theron excellent even in the worst circumstances (see 2008s ""Hancock"" for that) her pistol-packing Anna pretty much saves the movie when shes not saving her man. Well one of them. Anna blows into Old Stump seeming like a single girl but in truth shes married to notorious gunslinger Clinch (Liam Neeson who asked for and got to use his Irish accent). Nursing a broken heart is MacFarlanes Albert a nice-guy sheep farmer whose girlfriend just dumped him and even his parents dont like him. While Anna waits for Clinch to wrap up his latest bit of lawlessness she takes on Alberts miseries his ex Louise (Amanda Seyfried) and his wide-ranging frontier inadequacies. Related story Seth MacFarlane Charlize Theron find common ground in West Rebecca Keegan They share an agent as well as a fondness for bawdy jokes of which there are plenty in their new western-comedy. They share an agent as well as a fondness for bawdy jokes of which there are plenty in their new western-comedy. (Rebecca Keegan) Basically the movie is structured into a series of ""High Noon"" face-offs featuring MacFarlane trying to talk his way out of them. I say MacFarlane because Albert isnt a character per se but something else MacFarlanes put on with the vest the hat and the boots to play cowboys and hum Native Americans.That idea extends to the central comic conceits of the film -- a mash-up of 21st century sensibilities with Old West cliches. For example Albert cant shoot but he is good at math. Sometimes it works -- as it does with Louises breakup line about needing some time to ""work"" on herself. Other times it fails. When a band of Native Americans labels him a ""nerd"" it barely merits a chuckle. A Million Ways to Die in the West trailer The trailer for ""A Million Ways to Die in the West."" The trailer for ""A Million Ways to Die in the West."" See more videos The deeper problem is the way the director uses political incorrectness like a blunt instrument. Mocking convention religion ethnicities etc. is a long comic tradition and well done it can provide insight and laughs. But the pejorative way ""West"" floats the references is problematic rather than provocative. Case in point A running joke involving Edward (Giovanni Ribisi) and Ruth (Sarah Silverman). Theyre sweethearts. Ruths a busy hooker at the local saloon. Edwards a virgin. Theyre waiting until marriage to have sex. Get it? The joke draws a laugh the first time. By No. 999999 you cant help but wonder why someone didnt just say no.Like many others Im a fan of MacFarlanes ""Family Guy"" -- and MacFarlane in ""Family Guy."" In addition to creating the popular Fox animated series he does an excellent job voicing many of the characters particularly Stewie the terrific enfant terrible.But on camera is another story. MacFarlanes scenes play very much like his appearances on talk shows a smart funny guy with an slightly goofy grin though a few moments in ""West"" edge closer to his 2013 gig hosting the Oscars remembered mostly for its meanness.Acting is something else entirely. The difference becomes clear the more time MacFarlane is opposite Theron who as we all know is quite good at it. Those scenes are his best but they also illustrate the divide between those who can and those who perhaps need to work at it longer before they make themselves the star of another movie.If MacFarlane wants to be a serious filmmaker or actor or both hes going to have to get serious about the craft -- from how the movie is pieced together to whether it makes sense. There is an internal logic to even the grandest farce.Unfortunately there are so many times that ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" reminds me of another death MacFarlane had a hand it. In Season 12 of ""Family Guy"" last year the creative team killed the beloved and brilliant ""Family"" dog Brian also voiced by MacFarlane. Of all the lofty reasons given in the turbulent aftermath of that decision I suspect it was something much simpler -- the series needed a shake-up and killing Brian offered the chance to title the episode ""Life of Brian"" a nod to Monty Python and emblematic of MacFarlanes off-the-cuff comic style.Television is a more forgiving medium. When fan outrage hit extreme levels the ""Family Guy"" writers simply resurrected Brian a few episodes later. There will be no such chance for ""West."" Oh and of the million ways to die in the West it turns out a comedy misfire is the deadliest of all.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com------------A Million Ways to Die in the WestMPAA rating R for strong crude and sexual content language throughout some violence and drug materialRunning time 1 hour 56 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Entertainment Reviews Column Seth MacFarlane Charlize Theron Giovanni Ribisi Emoticon ;) attempts to tackle relationships in 140 counts or less Seth MacFarlane Charlize Theron find common ground in West Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad78deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-a-million-ways-review-20140530-column.html,200,amillionwaystodieinthewest15,amillionwaystodieinthewest,latimes

Directed by Seth MacFarlane. 116 minutes. Opens Friday at major theatres 14AThere may indeed be A Million Ways to Die in the West as the title of Seth MacFarlanes parody western asserts. But theres just one path to his infantile humour. It starts from a clever brain that ceased emotional development at age 12 and winds its way through to the orifice that emits the rudest noises and effluence.Article Continued BelowThis is the curious thing about MacFarlane. He knows how to make people laugh as demonstrated in his Family Guy TV series his movie smash Ted and in sporadic moments of his gig hosting the Oscars last year.Yet hes afraid to stray from knuckle-dragging comedy being obsessed with jokes about farts diarrhea and genitals that splat more often than they zing. And if they dont work the first time hell try and try again.A Million Waysto Die in the West is a gross-out Gunsmoke with MacFarlane directing an old-timey facsimile of his modern self in the lead role of Albert a cowardly sheep herder in the Arizona of 1882.Albert cant abide the mindless brutality appalling hygiene and constant danger of life in Old Stump the tumbleweed town he reluctantly calls home ""Everything out here thats not you wants to kill you.""He gets no comfort or love from his girlfriend Louise (Amanda Seyfried) who breaks his heart by dumping him for moustachioed playboy Foy (the reliably funny Neil Patrick Harris). Albert recklessly challenges Foy to a gunfight a week hence even though the hapless sheep minder literally cant shoot to save his life.Enter Anna played by Charlize Theron a regular Annie Oakley who takes a shine to Albert and wants to show him how to cock his pistol. She neglects to tell him that shes married to the outlaw Clinch Leatherwood (Liam Neeson) an infamous and jealous gunslinger who regularly contributes to that million-ways body count.What should be an ensemble comedy is more of a showcase for MacFarlane who also co-writes and takes production and music credits. Your mileage may vary depending on your enthusiasm for his smirking frat-boy comedy. This is MacFarlanes first live-action lead role (he voiced the potty-mouthed bear in Ted) and for my money hes simply not great at being the leading man coming off as more obnoxious than straight-up funny.Hes outclassed by Charlize Theron who shows off her comedy chops in a surprisingly big way and generally seems to be enjoying herself. MacFarlane deserve some credit for allowing Theron to upstage him sometimes just with a knowing look. Maybe its his way of paying her back for mentioning her in his tasteless ""We Saw Your Boobs"" song at the Oscars.The movies best lines are typically one-liners that rarely come from the lips of MacFarlane who frequently oversells a joke when he isnt merely spouting obscenities. His running gag about how people never smile in old-fashioned photographs might have seemed hilarious on paper but it certainly isnt on the screen. Ditto the overdone sideshow of Sarah Silvermans energetic town prostitute bonding with Giovanni Ribisis bible-thumping virginal shoemaker.Is it possible to overthink moronic humour? MacFarlane certainly seems to embrace this contradiction. He shows impeccable taste in how his movie looks (his DOP Michael Barrett makes Monument Valley a locale to die for) and also how it sounds. Yet the screenplay he penned with Family Guy/Ted hands Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild is slapdash at best.If MacFarlane had spent as much time crafting jokes as he did writing the lyrics for the amusing title tune (sung by country ace Alan Jackson) and the catchy mid-film number ""The Mustache Song"" A Million Ways to Die in the West would have been a much better movie. Given his knack for singing -- the guy truly is multi-talented -- MacFarlane might have done better with following the musical comedy example of Paint Your Wagon rather than the slapstick of Mel Brooks for his western swing.Seth MacFarlane is generally upstaged by his co-stars not just sheep in A Million Ways to Die in the West.

Universal Pictures hide caption toggle caption Universal Pictures Seth MacFarlane who wrote and directed A Million Ways to Die in the West stars as Albert a cowardly sheep farmer who inadvertently falls in love with the wife (Charlize Theron) of a dangerous outlaw (Liam Neeson). Universal Pictures Theres a scene in Seth MacFarlanes animated sitcom Family Guy in which the precocious baby Stewie attempts to get his moms attention through a solid 30 seconds of just repeating her name or variations on the word ""mom."" Thats the whole joke A kid just keeps repeating essentially the same word for 30 seconds until he wears her down and then he doesnt have anything more to say than ""hi"" once he finally gets her attention. Thats MacFarlanes A Million Ways to Die in the West in a nutshell A constant assault of repetitive jokes designed to wear the viewer down without much to say in the end. Whats frustrating about MacFarlane -- who writes directs and stars in this Western about Albert a cowardly sheep farmer who inadvertently falls in love with the wife (Charlize Theron) of a dangerous outlaw (Liam Neeson) -- is that sometimes maybe even as much as half the time he actually is legitimately funny. There are subtle smart jokes scattered throughout the film but they tend to get drowned by the bleating volume of lazy jokes about bodily functions racial and gender stereotypes and learning-disabled sheep. The problem isnt that the jokes are crass; theyre just not that funny. MacFarlanes obvious touchstone here is another Western comedy that was both crass and smartly provocative Mel Brooks 1974 Blazing Saddles. Like Brooks MacFarlane attempts to hit satirical hot buttons making jokes at the expense of racists and the closed-minded and employing strategic anachronisms and fourth-wall breaking to help make points about the ridiculousness of old-fashioned attitudes. Its odd to point to [Mel] Brooks as a model of restraint but Blazing Saddles is a model of Bergmanesque austerity in comparison to A Million Ways to Die. Where Brooks made a funny point about bean-sparked frontier flatulence in one brief and memorable scene MacFarlane cant let five minutes go by without a fart joke. Its odd to point to Brooks as a model of restraint but Blazing Saddles is a model of Bergmanesque austerity in comparison to A Million Ways to Die. Where Brooks made a funny point about bean-sparked frontier flatulence in one brief and memorable scene MacFarlane cant let five minutes go by without a fart joke. Poor Neil Patrick Harris -- playing the foppish owner of a mustache-accessory store who steals Alberts girlfriend (Amanda Seyfried) -- has to play a seemingly endless scene of violent diarrhea in the middle of a street with a particularly unnecessary payoff at the end. Bridesmaids did nearly the same thing but MacFarlane is determined to up the ante on that scene in every respect except the humor. Occasionally quietly MacFarlane plays the thoughtful provocateur rather than the carnival huckster and it comes down to the old storytelling rule of showing rather than telling. Albert sitting at a table self-consciously telling a couple of friends a bunch of terrible ways the West can kill you like a second-rate stand-up comic? Not so funny. But when his character shows blithe insensitivity by accepting the governments propaganda about Native American relations its a funnier way of poking at 19th century racial attitudes than the moments when Albert just comes out and tells us what were supposed to be getting out of a scene. All creative projects are about choice and more than anything else A Million Ways to Die in the West comes off as an abdication of creative choice. Theres no sign of a filter here no indication that MacFarlane and his co-writers Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild ever looked at a gag and thought ""You know this one isnt good enough."" Instead we get everything that crossed their minds. More With Seth MacFarlane Monkey See The Oscars Broadcast Zooming Way Past Cheeky To Land Squarely On Crass Wait Wait...Dont Tell Me Not My Job Family Guy Creator Seth MacFarlane As a result the movie is a good 20 minutes too long. There are a lot of repeated jokes that just start to feel stale the sixth joke about the prostitute played by Sarah Silverman being called away from her virginal boyfriend (Giovanni Ribisi) to have loud sex within earshot isnt any funnier than the first. But the lack of editing also means that they cant resist trying to hit every Western trope they can. Just when the movie seems like it should be about to end we get an extended sequence with Indians and a mescaline-induced vision quest that just drags the already choppy pacing of the film off a hallucinogenic cliff. The other choice that might have benefited the movie is a different lead. MacFarlane may have a facility for playing voice characters but when hes on screen himself he just seems like a version of the same smirking presence that hosted the Oscars in a cowboy hat instead of a tux. With MacFarlane on screen as a minor variation of his real-life persona its that much harder to get away from the feeling that hes playing the role of Stewie here spending two hours tapping us on the shoulder constantly asking ""Is this funny? Is this funny? What about this? Is this funny?""

Borrowing its setting and premise from ""Blazing Saddles"" it gives us a sarcastic modern-minded hipster in an 1880s Western town. Albert a fast-talking cowardly descendant of Bob Hope and Woody Allen played by director/producer/co-writer Seth MacFarlane is an underdog with an attitude. He hates Arizona a place where boredom is everywhere and death is just around the corner. If the outlaws rattlesnakes or ""the latest offering of the frontier disease-of-the-month club"" dont get you he fumes the doctors will Medical science is likely to treat a headache with a mule kicking. The film gives its tomfoolery a classic frame with grandiose Monument Valley cinematography and a sweeping score that recalls the symphonic western compositions of Elmer Bernstein and Dmitri Tiomkin. Theres also a story a rarity in this era of arbitrary chaos-driven comedies. Albert a knock-kneed yellow-belly has to man up and confront the Arizona territorys deadliest gunslinger (Liam Neeson). Theres even a full-blown subplot a romantic rivalry involving Albert his ex (Amanda Seyfried) her new beau (Neil Patrick Harris) and Alberts new gunslinger gal pal (Charlize Theron) that occasionally becomes the main plot. The competent funny and gorgeous Therons attraction to the underachieving MacFarlane (pointedly one of the only men in town without facial hair) even gets a half-convincing explanation. Its good to see serious actors like Neeson and Theron letting their hair down and they ably carry every scene theyre in. Much of the film rests on MacFarlanes shoulders and he has toned down the snide obnoxious demeanor that spoiled his turn as the 2013 Oscars host. Here hes poised charming and handsome -- quite affable. Hes at the center of most of the films brazen immature gags but avoids the taint of smugness by playing a craven underdog. The burden of dislikability falls to the black-hatted Neeson and Harris a smarmy dandy who runs the towns mustache emporium. His pretentious boutique selling overpriced pomades and elixirs would be right at home in any upscale 21st-century mall. Universal Pictures Seth MacFarlanes newest movie also starring Liam Neeson Charlize Theron and Neil Patrick Harris and some sheep is an affectionate raunchy parody of the classic western movies of his youth. The film plays like a raunchy affectionate parody of the western films that made an impression on MacFarlane when he was a kid. Theres a big well-staged dance extravaganza an epic barroom brawl and a fairly thrilling horses-and-train chase scene amid all the incongruous humor. True to the films title any number of minor characters are carried off by absurd accidents. The county fair is a festival of death (watch out for the flash powder at the photo booth) and in the saloon we witness what I think is cinemas first fatality by fart. There are wildly funny bits here including a 1980s pop-culture reference that is as uproarious as it is unexpected. A film like this would be incomplete without an excrement gag and the delightfully hammy Harris milks this one to hysterical extremes. And most of the films anachronistic jokes succeed. There are funny extended riffs on the poker-faced poses of folks in old-time pictures and a good gag about ""splitting the country 50-50"" with ungrateful American Indians. The racial religious and sexual jokes here spoof ugly retrograde attitudes rather than endorsing them. The films biggest failing is its pacing. It carries a good deal of excess weight clocking in at an arduous two hours. Giovanni Ribisi and Sarah Silverman have a generous amount of screen time but only a single overstretched joke as the towns virginal cobbler and his prostitute fiance. Alberts encounter with Cochise (Wes Studi wisely playing it straight) leads to an overblown peyote dream sequence that goes nowhere. Universal has done the film no favors by revealing many of the choicest jokes in their advertising trailers. Expect a fistful of laughs nothing more. Colin Covert has covered films for the Star Tribune for 20 years interviewing Peter Jackson Kate Winslet Steven Spielberg Cate Blanchett Quentin Tarantino Neil Gaiman and John Travolta to name a few. Colins job as a film critic consists mostly of thinking up synonyms for ""mediocre."" He still gets a thrill when the lights dim and all too often a bigger thrill when they come on again.

And the Family Guy and Ted creators one-and-done gig hosting the Oscars a couple of years back?where he whipped up a tizzy of faux outrage with his now-infamous ""We Saw Your Boobs"" number?didnt exactly help matters. Love him or hate him though (or simply love to hate him) his naughty-boy sagebrush send-up A Million Ways to Die in the West is actually pretty hilarious. From his sideline obsession with Rat Pack swizzle-stick showmanship to his undeniably clever piggybacking on the small-screen legacy of The Simpsons and South Park MacFarlane is clearly a guy who isnt afraid to borrow from his betters. And his new film is such an unapologetic homage to 1974s Blazing Saddles that Mel Brooks probably deserves to get a cut of the box-office receipts. Still MacFarlane manages to make the film his own goosing Brooks original formula with hard-R raunchiness and post-modern mischief. While MacFarlane kept himself off-screen in Ted (he merely provided the profane voice of Mark Wahlbergs fuzzy pal) here he puts himself front and center as Albert Stark?a cowardly and inept sheep farmer in the backwater town of Old Stump Arizona circa 1882. At the outset of the film Albert is cowering at ten paces face-to-face with a grisly gunslinger nervously trying to weasel his way out of a duel. His stammering excuses to back out quickly become a sort of manic stand-up routine that encapsulates the theme of the movie riffing on all the ways that the Old West contrary to Hollywood legend is actually a horrible place the people are stupid yokels the height of medicine is treating wounds with the pecking beaks of blue jays and if the Indians dont kill you the rattlesnakes on the way to the nearest outhouse will. Hes like Louis CK in chaps. Ashamed by Alberts lily-livered lack of courage his schoolmarm girlfriend Louise (Amanda Seyfried) dumps him for Foy the dandy proprietor of the local mustache shop played with literal whisker-twirling glee by Neil Patrick Harris. Explaining why hes more fit to woo her than Albert is he says ""I can give her wrapped candies."" Albert is encouraged to try and win Louise back by his sexually frustrated dim-bulb best friend (Giovanni Ribisi) whose prostitute girlfriend (Sarah Silverman with a bottomless grab bag of blow-job one-liners and bodily fluid gags) withholds sex while doing unprintable acts in her day job. But Albert is no match for the deep pockets bad puns and luxurious waxed handlebar of Foy. Meanwhile the areas most wanted desperado Clinch Leatherwood (Liam Neeson) is on the run from the law who while hiding out sends his sharp-shooting beauty of a wife Anna (Charlize Theron) into town to lay low. Which is fine by her. She hates the scoundrel and only married him because she was nine at the time and afraid of becoming a spinster. Needless to say Anna and the harmless good-hearted Albert bond over how dreadful and absurd range life is. Eventually she hatches a scheme for them to pose as an item to make Louise jealous while she teaches him how to shoot a gun and grow a pair. MacFarlane who wrote the script with Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild keeps the gags flying like hot lead out of a Colt .45. And for every three that dont land one or two hit the bullseye. There are probably a few too many lazy fart and diarrhea jokes for some but 14-year-old boys will love it. And while the self-satisfied MacFarlane may give himself a little too much credit and face time as a leading man (I couldnt help thinking he looks like Peter Brady and his knack for laughing at his own gags is slightly grating) Theron displays a stunning set of razor-sharp comedic chops that shes rarely been given the chance to show off. It suits her as well as the bustle gown she wears to the local hoedown. ""Why are the Indians so mad?"" she asks at one point. ""Were basically splitting the country 50/50 with them"" I dont know if A Million Ways to Die in the West will turn any of the MacFarlane haters into fans. But for those of us who have remained on the fence until now his raunchy rat-a-tat parody is proof that beneath all of the bratty immaturity lays the head and heart of an outrageous quick-draw satirist.

For showtimes trailers and reviews click the bold text in each item. (Opening dates may change.) The Fault in Our Stars (June 6) Dont forget the tissues. The movie based on a bestselling young adult novel by John Green follows a teenager stricken with cancer (Shailene Woodley) who falls for a free-spirited boy (Ansel Elgort) set on teaching her how to live while she still can. James Bridges/Twentieth Century Fox Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. By Michael OSullivan May 29 2014 When it was revealed that video of Charlize Therons reaction to 2013 Academy Awards host Seth MacFarlanes awards-night ditty ""We Saw Your Boobs"" was not spontaneous exasperation but a pre-recorded part of the joke we learned two things about the Oscar-winning actress Shes not only a really good sport but boy can she keep a straight face. Both of these skills are in evidence in ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" a broad wildly hit-or-miss satire of Westerns co-starring Theron and MacFarlane (who also directed produced and co-wrote the film). Crude rude and -- in the case of actor Liam Neesons derriere -- briefly nude the movie not only taxes Therons willingness to crack wise about her lady parts but demonstrates that she can do so without cracking up on camera. The same cannot be said of MacFarlane. Look no one ever accused the guy of being Sir Laurence Olivier. Best known as the creative jack-of-all-trades behind the cartoon series ""American Dad"" ""Family Guy"" and ""The Cleveland Show"" MacFarlane when put in front of a camera seems caught in a perpetual smirk as though hes inordinately pleased with himself. Perhaps he has some right to be. The new movie -- in which MacFarlane plays a cowardly lovelorn sheep farmer with Theron as his romantic mentor and Neeson his gunslinging nemesis -- is passably funny assuming you have the stomach for jokes about diarrhea sex death and all manner of body parts (both human and sheep). Judging by the rapid-fire raunchy humor in the red-band trailer this is an effective combination. When stretched out to almost two hours by all the absurdist plotting pop-culture asides and sometimes painfully awkward silences that MacFarlane is known for its not quite so zingy. In fairness MacFarlane knows his own weakness. Hes not the hero of the movie as his character Albert reminds us. Rather hes ""the guy in the crowd making fun of the heros shirt."" This observational detachment -- being in the movie but not of it -- can work but only to the degree that you let it. As the Village Voice favorably -- and aptly -- noted MacFarlane is like the animated Roger Rabbit here a cartoon stuck in a live action world. Some viewers however may wish for a bit more commitment. The disconnect between Albert and the world he inhabits is at times off-putting especially when you compare MacFarlanes performance with those of his co-stars. Theron is not only quite funny but also fully invested in the role of Anna a woman who pretends to be Alberts girlfriend so that he can make his ex-squeeze Louise (Amanda Seyfried) jealous. Neil Patrick Harris also fully inhabits the role of Louises extravagantly mustachioed and egotistical lover Foy. Though shallowly written both parts are grounded in reality. With a supporting cast as strong as this -- supplemented by several surprise cameos from stars I wont mention -- does anyone care that MacFarlane cant really act? It never hurt Jerry Seinfeld whose paper-thin persona on his self-titled sitcom was made plausible if not fully three-dimensional by the top-notch ensemble that the star surrounded himself with. No the problem isnt MacFarlanes inch-deep performance. In a way we need him to splash through the proceedings like a kid in a puddle making fun of such tropes of the Western genre as the barroom brawl the bordello girls with hearts of gold the perfectly choreographed barn-dance blowout and the climactic gunfight. Cutting away from the action to comment on it is the joke. And it has become MacFarlanes signature style. The films failure isnt one of restraint either. As he demonstrated with his ""Boobs"" song MacFarlanes gift such as it is lies in pushing humor to the threshold of decorum and then charging across that line consequences be damned. Thats what we pay him for. The real problem with ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" is one of editing. There are a million jokes in it but only 500000 of them are funny.   1/2 R. At area theaters.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT On the American frontier a cowardly sheep farmer falls for a woman with a checkered past. Rated R. BOTTOM LINE MacFarlane scores another bulls-eye with this mix of raunchy humor and aw-shucks heart. CAST Seth MacFarlane Charlize Theron Liam Neeson LENGTH 154 If you loved ""Ted"" Seth MacFarlanes comedy about a teddy bear with a potty mouth and an active sex life youll love ""A Million Ways to Die in the West."" Its another example of MacFarlanes ability to mix poop jokes with romance foul language with sweet sentiment offensive humor with boyish charm. Not everyone will see it that way. After MacFarlane hosted last years Oscars his jokes -- about homosexuality womens breasts and Javier Bardems accent -- were criticized as evidence of a retrograde chauvinist streak in comedy. Theres plenty of that in MacFarlanes Western send-up set in the unenlightened Arizona of 1882. For some a fairground shooting gallery called Runaway Slaves wont be forgiven just because Jamie Foxx makes a cameo and a needless joke about two mincing fops wont be ameliorated by the openly gay Neil Patrick Harris here playing a mustachioed lady-killer. As for how the Indians are depicted you can probably imagine.

""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" is so full of gross-out humor that it makes Mel Brooks ""Blazing Saddles"" look like a Danny Kaye movie but at its heart lies a rather tender love story. MacFarlane who co-wrote co-produced and capably directed plays Albert a sheep farmer spurned by Louise (Amanda Seyfried) for his inability to shoot fight or otherwise assimilate into the violent West. The gorgeous Anna (Charlize Theron) comes along and bolsters his self-confidence though she neglects to mention her gunslinger husband Clinch Leatherwood (Liam Neeson). Sarah Silverman as a local prostitute and Giovanni Ribisi as her boyfriend provide most of the movies crass sexual humor. MacFarlane and Theron make an appealing couple and we bond with them all the way. For MacFarlanes fans the movies mix of raunch and romance will score another bulls-eye. Others might find themselves in more of a hanging mood. 102 VideoA Million Ways to Die in the West review PLOT On the American frontier a cowardly sheep farmer falls for a woman with a checkered past. advertisement | advertise on newsday CAST Seth MacFarlane Charlize Theron Liam Neeson LENGTH 154 BOTTOM LINE MacFarlane scores another bulls-eye with this mix of raunchy humor and aw-shucks heart.

(Photo/Video Magnolia Pictures) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Updated May 29 2014 640 p.m. ET 3 COMMENTS Lukas Moodyssons ""We Are the Best"" captures the screw-loose joy of youth with consummate ease and grace. The time is 1982 and the place is Stockholm where three middle-school girls are determined to start a punk band even though they know punk is over and two of the three have no instruments or discernible musical skills. (The existence of chords and harmony comes as news to them.) Dont be put off by the punk or by what might strike you as a depleted era of pop history. The true--and universal--concerns of this blissfully funny film are living life pushing limits making a mark discovering love. And dont expect a standard coming-of-age story since the outcome is mercifully free of intimations of maturity. Its a being-of-age story in Swedish with English subtitles the age being early adolescence when kids with throbbing hearts and incompletely wired brains are full of passion and blithe illogic. Mr. Moodysson who was once deemed a ""young master"" by Ingmar Bergman has had his ups and downs in a career that began provocatively with ""Show Me Love"" in 1998 My favorite ups are ""Together"" (2000) and ""Lilya 4-Ever"" (2002). Now at the age of 45 hes neither young nor old but hes certainly masterly with a touch so delicate as to be undetectable. Instead of performances theres a magical sense of life caught on the fly. (In fact the filmmaker adapted the script from a comic book by his wife Coco Moodysson. The cinematographer was Ulf Brantas and the editor was Michal Leszczylowski.) The premusical members of the punk trio--atonal cant convey the gleeful racket they manage to make--are Bobo (Mira Barkhammar) and her buddy Klara (Mira Grosin). They are both of them 13 years old and so thoroughly lovable that every glimpse of their funny faces brings new delight. Bobo is the tender tomboy quiet and seemingly earnest behind her round steel-rimmed glasses. Klara is the impish one sporting hair that shes spiked with soap; neither her pretty face nor her whirligig mind are ever in repose. Ignorant of music the friends may be but theyre smart enough to persuade an actual musician to join them. Hedvig (Liv LeMoyne) is 14 an eighth-grader and genuinely more mature than Bobo and Klara though that in itself isnt saying much. Serious sweetly humorless--or at least irony-deficient--and friendless until the advent of the alliance Hedvig has two big things going for her in Bobos and Klaras eyes. She plays the guitar having taken lessons for four years and shes a practicing Christian which means that the other two can try to liberate her from what they see as her repression and win her over to their vaporous notions of agnosticism. (Their first initiative in the latter campaign consists of singing her a hideous ditty of their devising called ""Hang God."") Half a century ago when Bergman was in his prime the arrival of a new film by the Swedish master or by other masters in other countries was a significant event for a significant number of American film lovers. Times have changed of course. Foreign films as a cultural movement have lost much of their luster in the era of the multiplex and of marketing bombardments whose budgets routinely run to many tens of millions of dollars. On a week when two heavily marketed studio productions will open on thousands of screens this little Swedish comedy will be hard for filmgoers to find. But Mr. Moodyssons film is little only in physical and financial scale. When measured by the pleasure it confers ""We Are the Best"" is a big deal that will be winning hearts--and even grownup minds--for a long time to come. Watch a clip from the film ""A Million Ways to Die in the West."" Starring Seth MacFarlane Charlize Theron Liam Neeson Amanda Seyfried and Neil Patrick Harris. (Photo/Video Universal) A Million Ways to Die in the West Mel Brooks can relax. (If he can relax.) Seth MacFarlanes comedy western is no ""Blazing Saddles."" Some of it sputters settling for smiles instead of laughs and much of it flounders while the slapdash script searches at exhausting length for ever more common denominators in toilet humor. Handsomely photographed (by Michael Barrett) and enhanced by an irony-free score (by Joel McNeely) ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" starts with a clever idea or at least with a promising character--a cowardly sheep farmer Albert (played by Mr. MacFarlane) who lives in frontier Arizona in the late 19th century and loathes everything about it except Amanda Seyfrieds Louise a local beauty who rebuffs his love because she loathes his cowardice. But the production is seldom as funny as it promises to be though it does turn downright likable when a mysterious beauty named Anna (Charlize Theron) is on screen and the script--by Mr. MacFarlane Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild--isnt trying to be funny at all. ENLARGE Charlize Theron and Seth Macfarlane in A Million Ways to Die in the West Universal Pictures Thats because Ms. Therons dry droll style provides a fine foil for Mr. MacFarlanes blandness as an actor. Albert who remains stuck on Louise warms with painful slowness to the possibility that Anna might consider him attractive. But Anna finds the situation amusing and Ms. Theron whos as skilled in the ways of comedy as she is beautiful makes Annas amusement alluring even endearing. Mostly though Alberts blandness stands him in not-so-good stead as a quasi-action hero in a pseudo-saga that sends up a variety of western tropes--gunfights saloon brawls chases on horseback across red-rock landscapes--with little wit and no bite. The cast includes Liam Neeson as a swaggering villain and Neil Patrick Harris as the mustache-twirling proprietor of a shop that sells mustache wax. A couple of surprise cameos are funny enough to get by without making a scintilla of sense. Watch a clip from the film ""Maleficent."" Starring Angelina Jolie Elle Fanning and Sharlto Copley. (Photo/Video Disney) Maleficent Under the banner of not leaving well enough alone--remember ""Oz the Great and Powerful""?--Disneys ""Maleficent"" tells the hitherto untold and long unawaited back story of ""Sleeping Beauty"" from the point of view of the evil witch. In this version Maleficent who is played as an adult by Angelina Jolie in full-bore hauteur isnt evil as a child. Far from it she is sweet-spirited and pure of heart until a betrayal turns her heart to stone. That raises the question of why her parents didnt pick a nicer name for her--Beneficent might have been a good choice--but lots of other questions are raised by a live-action movie that comes to life only when the screen is flooded by digital effects of variable quality. Sometimes theyre gorgeous as in several flying sequences; sometimes theyre murky or violent and banal as in several battle sequences; and sometimes theyre cute but a little creepy as in escapades of the three pixies--now named Flittle Knotgrass and Thistletwit--who reminded me of Fred Astaire Nanette Fabray and Jack Buchanan dancing on their knees as babies in the ""Triplets"" number of ""The Band Wagon."" The answer to one central question--why the reliance on technology at the expense of simple humanity--lies in the background of the director Robert Stromberg. He has never directed a movie until now but hes a reigning wizard of digital effects which is clearly what Disney wanted. (Just as the runaway success of the Broadway musical ""Wicked"" is what the studio wanted to emulate in single-witch mode.) Ms. Jolie is in truth a formidable presence--with heightened cheekbones that sweep up into her ears like the speed lines on a sports car and green vapors rising from her shoulders. Still this icon of witchcraft cant save a production thats suffocatingly elaborate yet insufficiently bewitching. Watch a clip from the film ""Night Moves."" Starring Jesse Eisenberg Dakota Fanning Peter Sarsgaard and Alia Shawkat. (Photo/Video Cinedigm) Night Moves Kelly Reichardts meditation on the contradictions of the environmental movement focuses on three eco-terrorists--they consider themselves radical environmentalists--as they prepare to blow up a hydroelectric dam with a boat bomb then follows them as they absorb the consequences of what theyve done. Although the film generates some suspense in the process its main concern is morality and a decay that besets the self-styled idealists. Paradoxically though the action phase slow-paced as it is proves to be more interesting than its moral consequences which unfold with glum predictability and lead to an oddly opaque conclusion. Jesse Eisenberg Dakota Fanning and Peter Sarsgaard play the conspirators. Mr. Eisenbergs Josh is anxious from the start a man given to long reflective walks in the woods. (The Oregon locales are spectacularly beautiful.) Ms. Fannings Dena comes from a wealthy Eastern family and bankrolls the purchase of the secondhand speedboat that gives the movie its name. Mr. Sarsgaards Harmon has a technical confidence born of military experience and a prison record that he mentions only in passing. Any one of the three could be the ventures weak link. ENLARGE Jesse Eisenberg in Night Moves Cinedigm Ms. Reichardt who wrote the script with Jonathan Raymond has made several films of calm distinction mysteriously minimalist dramas that require close attention and offer no easy explanations in return. Thats the style she has deployed here but the story is a shallow-draft bark with flat characters on board Josh in particular is de-energized to the point of entropy. ""Night Moves"" suffers from a lack of mystery and a deficit of motion. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download ENLARGE Together (2000) Lucas Moodyssons terrific political comedy which starts in 1975 centers on a Stockholm commune thats riven by arguments great and small--over sex Marxist-Leninist doctrine the materialist aspects of ""Pippi Longstocking"" and the introduction by truly radical elements of hot dogs and a small black-and-white television. Some members leave and some stay but the group reconstitutes itself on the basis of real feelings rather than political posturings. The idea of togetherness can be a good thing ""Together"" says; a better thing is people drawn together by love in all its unlikely forms. ENLARGE Young Adult (2011) Charlize Theron is Mavis Gary a self-deluded author of young-adult novels. Mavis was once prom-queen beautiful. Now in her late 30s she can still pull herself together to fairly dazzling effect. But she is also sly selfish nasty hurt and hurtful dryly sardonic and fatefully deluded. What makes her such a marvelous character is what seethes deep beneath her skin. What makes me continue to wonder about this movie which Jason Reitman directed from a script by Diablo Cody is why most people I know are baffled by my fondness for it. ENLARGE Published Credit no credit no credit Meeks Cutoff (2010) Kelly Reichardts marvelous minimalist epic amounts to a master class in the power of observation. Much of the action is seen and barely heard in long shots. The pace matches that of the characters three families in a wagon train moving slowly toward Oregon in 1845. At least the families hope theyre headed for Oregon since their guide a mountain man named Stephen Meek has taken them on an unmarked path and theyve lost their way. Meek is played with layered extravagance by Bruce Greenwood but you watch everyone and everything with unswerving attention.

There glad thats out of the way. Though its all worth mentioning because its the sort of ""outrageous"" gross-out gaggery that co-writer/director/producer/star Seth MacFarlane slops onto what otherwise looks like his childhood dream of making a straightforward sentimental white-hat/black-hat Western about a decent sheep farmer forced to do battle against the general indecency of the frontier. Apparently his inner child lacks confidence No one will tolerate these gorgeous sunset shots unless Im totally baked while watching them. Self-conscious importation of modern sensibilities into olden times is the modus operandi but every now and then MacFarlane forgets himself and just has fun a chase sequence featuring horses and trains; a song and dance number about mustaches. Once or twice he even seems to feel something. Sarah Silverman plays a whore who wont sleep with her beau til theyre married and Charlize Theron plays a game and gorgeous frontier gal. 2014. -- Matthew Lickona This movie is not currently in theaters. Facebook Twitter Google+ Share Email Comments DanDiego May 31 2014  1047 a.m. Seth MacFarlane should stay behind the camera. On screen hes not funny or appealing just egotistical. This movie has lots of borderline or outright racist jokes very few original sight gags too many stupid sex and penis jokes and gratuitous bloody violence thrown in for no apparent reason. The best things in this movie are the classic western music and the scenery. The movie is too long and not very funny. Go see Blazing Saddles and Django instead to see how its done right. 1 0 Add photo Post reply Sign in to reply Sign in to suggest removal Sign in to comment Username I have an account. Im new.

As far as I can tell MacFarlanes long-running animated TV show ""Family Guy"" and his 2012 hit movie ""Ted"" are subject to the same division Not many people feel neutral about them. At his best MacFarlane has the gift of self-deflating farce and the comic insight to grasp that you can get away with all sorts of offensive or idiotic gags if you make yourself the butt of the joke. While pretty much every professional comedian has mastered good timing MacFarlane is a master of bad timing which is more unusual.He has an extended bit of business in this movie when his character a hapless 19th-century sheep rancher named Albert tries to deliver a devastating pornographic putdown to the mustachioed fop who has stolen his girl. (Said chick-stealing fop is played by Neil Patrick Harris and yeah hardy-har-har.) But the gag is incomprehensible none of the onlookers laugh and Albert sneaks back a few seconds later to explain himself which only heightens the awkwardness. MacFarlane who also directed the film leaves himself out there to struggle for a few more seconds like the bridegrooms brother trying to save a rehearsal dinner thats gone south until Albert can gather what remains of his dignity and depart. The big laugh this got from the movies audience when I saw it was genuine and came more from compassion than mockery.You cant say that MacFarlane lacks ambition or at least bravado. With ""Ted"" he made a story about an adult man and his foulmouthed talking teddy bear into a massive comedy hit and here he directs co-writes and stars in a spoof of a movie genre whose popularity had vanished before most of todays moviegoing audience was born. Maybe hes trying to recapture the spirit of Mel Brooks ""Blazing Saddles"" but that movie was made in 1974 when everyone watching it had grown up with ""Shane"" and ""True Grit"" and ""High Noon."" Toward what end MacFarlane is channeling his abundant ambition is a more complicated question.By introducing his own persona into the equation as both sad-sack leading man and wiseass commentator on how much life sucks in the Old West MacFarlane seems to be bidding for the comedy throne of Adam Sandler whose star is evidently on the wane after several commercial duds. Sandler has built an immensely lucrative career off movies that self-evidently dont give a damn about dramatic realism and that combine a series of outrageous set-pieces and toilet gags with simple-minded and highly sentimental stories of redemption. Thats exactly the terrain were in here and while the whole thing feels weirdly miscalculated to me ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" tweaks the formula just enough delivers a few laughs and keeps the guest stars coming. I dont think its a ""Ted""-scale hit but its probably not a bomb.In fairness MacFarlane does not hew to the Sandler maxim of extreme casualness which dictates that no one involved with the film should behave at any time as if they cared whether it ever got finished or how it might turn out. Yes Albert and the long lean stranger named Anna (Charlize Theron) who assigns herself the task of turning him into an acceptable man sound and act nothing like 19th-century Americans - theyre all like ""Duuude"" and ""Fuuuuck"" and ""Noooo"" and ""Whaaat"" -- but thats clearly a considered choice. And lots of things about the movie are only in there to yank our collective chain like Harris as a suave ladykiller (though John Cho and Kal Penn got there first) and Sarah Silverman as a prostitute who talks about the details of her workday in way too much detail but wont sleep with virginal boyfriend Giovanni Ribisi because theyre both devout Christians. (Whoa WTF) You Might Also Like But none of that conceals the fact that significant effort went into this production. There are widescreen shots of the iconic Monument Valley scenery; theres a dolly-shot horseback sequence no doubt ripped off from some John Ford picture; theres an elaborate barn-dance number featuring complicated choreography pro-style hoofing from Harris (of course) an original song and patter from Bill Maher. Theres a dirty lowdown villain played by Liam Neeson who will take any role but does not work cheap and a cameo by Gilbert Gottfried as an Abe Lincoln impersonator. No doubt Gottfried does work dirt-cheap these days - in fact I sincerely hope he had to pay MacFarlane - but consider the pain and suffering involved in having him around even for a few hoursWhile some of the special effects in ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" are unbelievably crappy others are pretty effective including the gruesome scene when we see a guy crushed by a giant block of ice that just came off the train from Boston. You see the action such as it is gets periodically interrupted by non-sequitur violent deaths to support the otherwise irrelevant title and to illustrate Alberts premise that life in the Arizona Territory circa 1882 is basically crap. Speaking of which theres also a scene in which Harris character the supercilious proprietor of a mustache-supply emporium is smitten with uncontrollable diarrhea and must poop into other mens hats. Ill admit that I laughed maybe because of Harris grotesque extended slapstick routine and maybe because MacFarlane understands that if you drag a joke out long enough the audience is left with no choice except to defend itself with laughter. That particular special effect was not expensive or difficult Im thinking. I refuse to supply a plot synopsis; its simply not worth it. Theres a girl played by Amanda Seyfried and another one played by Theron and then theres the bandit played by Neeson who winds up with a daisy in his butt-crack. (Im assuming a butt-double was used.) MacFarlane is simultaneously a congenial screen presence and a remarkably bad actor so none of the interpersonal dynamics are even remotely convincing. The so-called romance between Albert and Therons Anna has negative chemistry; it feels more like shes taken a troubled youngster under her wing via the Big Sisters program. If you insist on finding a story in this movie its the story of MacFarlane flirting with offensive or unacceptable gags - cracks about the ""selfish"" Indians who wont let ""us"" have the country a shooting gallery featuring ""runaway slave"" caricatures - and then reassuring us that he means no harm hes not a right-wing asshole his hearts in the right place and so on. To return to the theme of the moment he wants to embrace white-guy privilege and renounce it at the same time. Its a neat trick if you can make it work. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

(AP Photo/Universal Pictures) HOEP This image released by Universal Pictures shows Seth MacFarlane right and Charlize Theron in a scene from ""A Million Ways to Die in the West."" (AP Photo/Universal Pictures) When Seth MacFarlane hosted the Academy Awards in 2013 it was the first time many moviegoers had heard of him. And even fans of his animated TV series ""Family Guy"" and ""American Dad"" were less familiar with his face than his voice.After lending the latter to his big-screen comedy ""Ted"" MacFarlane finally steps in front of the camera for ""A Million Ways to Die in the West."" Western comedies have been buried on Boot Hill since ""Blazing Saddles"" but as a writer and director MacFarlane has established the credentials to resurrect the genre. So its a shame that hes made such a lily-livered movie. And why did this greenhorn actor have to star in it?As a frontier sheep rancher named Albert MacFarlane starts the movie with a nod to Don Knotts in ""The Shakiest Gun in the West."" Yet after Albert weasels out of a high-noon gunfight MacFarlane the writer/director discards the subplot. That happens a lot in this sloppily scripted movie. And as an actor the dimly grinning MacFarlane makes Don Knotts look like Daniel Day-Lewis. Its especially apparent that MacFarlane is firing blanks when hes sharing the screen with tall-in-the-saddle actors such as Liam Neeson and Charlize Theron. They play outlaw Clinch and his sidekick Anna who temporarily split up after robbing an old prospector. Anna goes undercover in the backwater town of Old Stump where she makes the acquaintance of Albert and urges him to reclaim his lady love Louise (Amanda Seyfried) from mustachioed dandy Foy (Neil Patrick Harris). As the sexy cowgirl who teaches Albert to shoot a pistol roll a stogie and appreciate the Arizona sunset Theron is the desert rose in this dung heap. Sarah Silverman as a sleazy saloon gal and Giovanni Ribisi as her virginal suitor make a silk purse out of a sows rear and Harris merrily twirls the many mustache gags. But theres not enough meat or spice on the bones of the faux-outrageous screenplay which backs away from the fatalism in the title like a belle in a bar fight.Round these parts when a movie promises a million laughs but only delivers a dozen chuckles thats a hanging offense.

"A Million Ways to Die in the West (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review A Million Ways to Die in the West (R) Seth MacFarlanes vulgar comedy has its moments but not enough of them. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com5/29/2014 Editor rating 1 There are enough laughs scattered throughout A Million Ways to Die in the West that while youre watching it the movie seems like a passable comedy. By the time you get home though you can barely remember the jokes. The things that stay with you are the dull boilerplate love story the laziest performance of Liam Neesons career as a murderous gunslinger and the distracting amount of makeup Seth MacFarlane sports in the film. His face looks like it has been Photoshopped and smoothed over as if he were posing for a GQ cover even though hes playing a sheep farmer in the dusty Old West. His unnatural appearance fits right in with the rest of this star-studded vanity project a cheap-looking western (notice how small all the sets are) with a contemporary sensibility that feels like a bone Universal Pictures gave the writer-director as a reward for the success of Ted which grossed half a billion dollars in 2012. MacFarlane provided the voice of the foul-mouthed teddy bear in that movie the way he voices characters on Family Guy and American Dad But as an-screen presence MacFarlane recalls that old saying ""He has a face for radio."" Hes much funnier when hes just heard not so much when you have to watch him too. In A Million Ways to Die in the West MacFarlane surrounds himself with a stable of great comedians which doesnt do him any favors. Everyone is stuck with the same lame material -- a meek sheep farmer learns to find the courage to win over the girl of his dreams -- but performers such as Sarah Silverman (playing a hooker) and Neil Patrick Harris (a moustache-shop owner) are able to squeeze some juice out of this lumpy rock even when theyre saddled with old gags one stolen outright from Theres Something About Mary another that old classic stand-by -- the sudden bout of explosive diarrhea complete with an extreme close-up of the end result. Other actors such as Charlize Theron as the beautiful sharpshooter who takes an inexplicable interest in MacFarlane or Amanda Seyfried as his ex-girlfriend are simply miscast. Theron tries but doesnt get a single laugh in the entire film Shes only good at playing the tearful for-real subplot of the movie (yes here is another silly comedy that insists on inserting unconvincing heart and emotion like the worst Adam Sandler pictures when youd much rather be laughing). Seyfried whose scant screen time suggests heavy edits (but not enough; the movie runs a punishing 116 minutes) is here primarily so other characters can make fun of her big eyes. There are several surprise cameos some of them pointless others ingenious (the truly great one though has already been spoiled in the trailers and TV ads a sign of desperation by the marketing department to trick audiences into buying a ticket). Even the premise promised by the title which is laid out early on by MacFarlane in one of his few effective monologues (how did anyone survive the old West?) is set aside in favor of a dull zero-to-hero story. Ted too suffered from a third-act sentimental twist but the plentiful laughs that preceded it made the shift in tone easier to forgive. A Million Ways to Die in the West has wonderful opening credits that pay homage to John Fords Monument Valley westerns and there are some good throwaway bits such as a scene at an outrageously offensive shooting gallery at a carnival. But you expect more from an R-rated MacFarlane comedy than sheep penises or Neeson having a daisy stuck up his bare butt. The actors must have cracked up on the set. Too bad the merriment doesnt spill over into the audience. Cast Seth MacFarlane Charlize Theron Amanda Seyfried Neil Patrick Harris Giovanni Ribisi Sarah Silverman Liam Neeson Wes Studi. Director Seth MacFarlane. Screenwriters Seth MacFarlane Alec Sulkin Wellesley Wild. A Universal Pictures release. Running time 116 minutes.

Starring Seth MacFarlane Charlize Theron and Liam Neeson. Directed by Seth MacFarlane. (R. 116 minutes.) Writer-director Seth MacFarlane gives you 10 jokes where other comedians give you one so even if you dont like five of them you will still come out way ahead with ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" an inventive and caustic comedy that really does look like the thing its mocking. A parody of the great Technicolor Westerns of the 50s it has the Monument Valley setting and a faux Western score - and even the graphics call to mind those earlier pictures. It also has a point of view one thats buried under a cascade of gross humor but its there nonetheless and it gives the movie an extra edge. ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" isnt just a mock Western but an anti-Western asserting modern values and modern life over life as lived in the harsh days of legend. Now in a sense all comic Westerns do this whether were talking about Bob Hope in ""The Paleface"" (1948) or Mel Brooks ""Blazing Saddles."" The comedy is always in the contrast between the main characters who are always straight out of modern times and those around them homicidal lunatics at home in the lawless wilderness. But the awkwardness of the contrast - that is the fish-out-of-water aspect of the hero - is usually the source for the comedy not the contrast in values. More in Movies Cold in July review a skillfully made crime yarn The Grand Seduction review Quirky situation funny film Maleficent review Twist on Beauty casts enticing spell But in ""A Million Days to Die in the West"" MacFarlanes rejection of the Western legend is emphatic and funny. Early in the movie talking exactly like a man from 2014 and with no concession to the period he goes into a rant on why the West in 1882 is one of the most horrible places to live in all of history noting everything from the violence and the threat of illness to the horrors of the cuisine. ""Thats the American West"" he concludes. ""A disgusting awful cesspool of despair."" He doesnt belong there any more than we would and thats the connection MacFarlane builds with the audience. He plays Albert a sheep farmer who cant contain his sheep a loquacious guy in a world of silent types who has no violence in him though violence surrounds him everywhere. When his girlfriend (Amanda Seyfried) dumps him for a vain shopkeeper (Neil Patrick Harris) he really has no reason to stay in town except to try to get her back. ""A Million Ways to Die"" will be compared to ""Blazing Saddles"" for the way it cuts through movie cliche to show in a comic way the underside of Western life. But while Mel Brooks pointed out for example that eating beans probably made cowboys flatulent around the campfire MacFarlane is after something beyond absurdity. He gets to the crux of the matter that life in the West was cheap at least as portrayed in the movies and he tells us often hilariously that this is nothing we should celebrate. Charlize Theron plays a newcomer to town who strikes up a friendship with Albert a modern partnership of equals you dont find in old Westerns. Quite unexpectedly this is Therons best showcase since ""Young Adult"" three years ago a role with lots of conflict and internal movement. For one thing Anna (Theron) is secretly married to the most evil gunfighter in the West (Liam Neeson) who in comparison makes Jack Palance in ""Shane"" seem like a decent misunderstood fellow. Meanwhile on the lighter side theres Sarah Silverman very funny in a thoroughly coarse role as the town prostitute. Implicit in almost every Western - even the darkest ones - is the notion that America has lost something some pioneer individualism some rugged confidence some independent spirit. ""A Million Ways to Die"" is MacFarlanes way of saying no. Between the laughs its a plea for the city over open space the sophisticated over the homespun life over death and modernity over superstition. This makes it not only funny but refreshing.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 830 p.m. EDT May 29 2014In ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" starring Seth MacFarlane and Charlize Theron MacFarlane sends up Westerns directing and starring as a milquetoast farmer who falls for a new girl (Theron) in town but he winds up on the to-kill list of her gunslinger spouse (Liam Neeson).(Photo Universal Pictures)Like Blazing Saddles A Million Ways to Die in the West has a slew of comic set-ups and one-liners that kill. And as with Mel Brooks classic 1974 film it steps unabashedly into vulgar terrain.Seth MacFarlanes bawdy absurdist comic Western ( out of four; rated R; opening Thursday night in some theaters and Friday nationwide) boasts a clever high concept with lots of knowing jokes about the American frontier. It entertainingly spoofs the era offering a satirical take on movie Westerns. The only hitch in its giddy-up is how much it incorporates sophomoric and scatological humor. As directed produced and co-written by Teds MacFarlane the premise is humorous and the performances winning so the reliance on raunch seems unnecessary and its gross-out gags off-putting.MacFarlane pokes fun at an epoch in American history routinely romanticized in film. Sure the sunsets were striking but the Wild West was a minefield of murderous hazards.If the snakes didnt get you the bandits cholera tumbleweeds or county fair would.""We should all just wear coffins for clothes"" says Albert (MacFarlane) a nerdy sheep farmer living in Old Stump Ariz. in 1882. Albert finds life both dangerous and dull. He lives with his sullen aging parents who make the farming couple in Grant Woods American Gothic painting seem warm and cuddly.They glower when he comes through the door. ""Youre late"" snarls his ornery dad (Christopher Hagen).""For what?"" Albert asks.""Fair enough"" his dad replies.The locals are a dim lot.Albert reminds his best friend Edward (Giovanni Ribisi) that the mayor has been lying dead outside the saloon for days and no one seems to notice.Meanwhile Edward is in love with Ruth (Sarah Silverman) who puts in long hours at the local house of ill repute but he wants to wait to consummate their romance until after marriage.The opening credits make the most of Western vistas and a familiar Bonanza-style score and the film opens on a particularly bad day for Albert. A man he owes money to shoots him and then his girlfriend Louise (Amanda Seyfried) the town schoolmarm dumps him.When a vicious brawl breaks out at the local saloon Albert and Edward trade rhythmic fisticuffs in a comically choreographed tussle. Amid the mayhem Albert spots Anna (Charlize Theron) a mysterious stranger and saves her from the melee. They strike up a friendship based on their mutual hatred for frontier life.An ever-impressive dramatic actress Theron shows shes equally adept at sassy comedy.The next day Albert finds out that Louise has become romantically involved with Foy (Neil Patrick Harris) a smug shopkeeper who runs a ""moustachery."" The notion that a mustache makes the man is lampooned hilariously particularly at a barn dance where the joys of the mustache are set to music.When Albert foolishly challenges Foy to a gunfight -- and instantly regrets it -- Anna an expert marksman teaches him how to shoot. They grow closer. But unbeknownst to Albert Anna is the unhappy wife of the areas most infamous outlaw Clinch Leatherwood (Liam Neeson). When Clinch learns that Albert and Annie have kissed he goes ballistic. The only thing that will make Clinchs day is to shoot Albert.Plot details can be scattershot but it succeeds thanks to an outrageously comical deconstruction of Hollywood Westerns and an appealing cast of characters.A Western with a contemporary sensibility and dialogue that sounds markedly modern A Million Ways to Die in the West is quintessential MacFarlane at once silly and witty juvenile and clever. 124 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 13 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/05/29/a-million-ways-to-die-in-the-west-review/8324917/",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/05/29/a-million-ways-to-die-in-the-west-review/8324917/,200,amillionwaystodieinthewest30,amillionwaystodieinthewest,usatoday

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Seth MacFarlanes sloggy comic oater A Million Ways To Die In The West never wastes a good joke by telling it only once. Two is the minimum; four is better. MacFarlanes ""stoned nerd"" shtick can be funny in single doses but around the movies halfway point it becomes clear that he and his Ted and Family Guy co-writers Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild have brought only 30 minutes of material to a two-hour movie. To make up A Million Ways continually extrapolates on a small set of jokes the use of cocaine as an ingredient in medicine (two instances); extended Family Guy-style non-parodies (Back To The Future Part III Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade and Django Unchained); Old West people getting stoned (two instances plus a drug-trip sequence); the fact that nobody smiles in early photos (four instances); a shooting gallery with ""runaway slave"" targets (enough for one shot but used for an entire scene and a mid-credits stinger); the idea of a ""devoutly Christian"" prostitute who only practices abstinence with her fiance (more than 10 instances); the social significance of mustaches in 19th-century culture (more than 10 instances plus a musical number). Few of these get funnier after the first iteration. Several become annoying. Wearing a perpetual smirk and a tremendous amount of makeup MacFarlane stars as Albert Stark a self-aware sheep farmer in 1882 Arizona. After his schoolteacher girlfriend (Amanda Seyfried) dumps him for the oily proprietor (Neil Patrick Harris) of an upscale ""mustachery"" Albert sets out to win her back and in the process befriends new arrival Anna (Charlize Theron) unaware that she is the wife of notorious outlaw Clinch Leatherwood (Liam Neeson doing an exaggerated ""stage Irish"" accent). Playing his first major live-action role MacFarlane behaves like a sputtering stand-up riffing on weak material in extended take. (Theres one about how he imagines a black man might react to a bustle thats especially groan-worthy.)Comedy is humor organized given shape and purpose. Like much of MacFarlanes work A Million Ways suffers from an inability to maintain consistent characters or to make plot funny. (Ted now appears to be an outlier.) Its essentially a voice-acting exercise where every third line of dialogue qualifies as an aside and people rarely move while talking. Whenever MacFarlane--who has enough trouble maintaining basic continuity--has to stage a fight or choreograph a musical number the whole thing falls apart. Every now and then though the movie manages to pull out a funny joke--like a cutaway visual gag involving an unshorn sheep or a character complaining about how in the Old West ""theres only like three songs and theyre all by Stephen Foster""--only to lose it in a pile of repeated setups lame ethnic humor and over-extended scatological bits. This is the kind of movie where a man shitting in a hat is not enough; he must shit in two hats and then spill one of them in close-up.

Thats the sad sobering reality for nebbish sheep farmer Albert Stark (Seth MacFarlane) a man out of time in the perilous Old West. Theres outlandish danger lurking around every frontier bend and the long-running gag of A Million Ways shows us some of the silliest most grotesque manners in which a cowboy could perish. In case you didnt know ""decapitated by falling block of ice"" is not something you want on your tombstone. The plot doesnt pioneer into virgin territory Albert overcomes a breakup with the help of a mysterious new woman in town (Charlize Theron) who happens to be married to the regions most notorious bandit (Liam Neeson). Theres the requisite saloon fight the peyote-induced moment of epiphany with fun-loving Native Americans and of course a gun-slinging duel at high noon--three of them in fact. Its a full-on MacFarlane production (he cowrote and directed) so the toilet jokes and f-bombs flow as freely as the whiskey. Despite the constant threat of untimely death though the consequences never seem too dire and MacFarlanes irreverent humor feels subdued without the jolt of animation that gave his previous big-screen effort Ted an extra oomph of shock and awe. Still the one-liners and sight gags hit more than they miss and numerous cameos are a delight Watch for an encounter with an 80s time-travel-movie icon conducting a ""weather experiment.""

Photo AP MOVIE REVIEW A Million Ways to Die in the West Running time 120 minutes. Rated R (crude humor sexual content profanity graphic violence drug use). At the Empire the Kips Bay the Union Square others. How nasty is the 1882 frontier in ""A Million Ways to Die in the West""? So brutal that a schoolmarm ""got her throat slit by a fast-moving tumbleweed."" So savage that the pastor ends his sermon ""God bless you for another week and there is a mountain lion warning in effect."" So ruthless that the ownership of the New York Times is consulting the script for tips on how to handle its next personnel decision. I laughed more at Seth MacFarlanes sendup of 60s Westerns than I did at all the other comedies Ive seen this year combined. I even laughed as much as I did at ""Noah."" MacFarlane is just passable as a leading man but as a director and co-writer with two others he has a wider comic imagination than ""Blazing Saddles."" For every so-so gag there are three genius ones. Amanda Seyfried and Neil Patrick Harris star in ""A Million Ways to Die in the West.""Photo AP MacFarlane the ""Family Guy"" creator plays Albert an heir to the fast-talking cowards of Bob Hope and early Woody Allen movies ""Im not the hero"" he says defining the life of a comedy writer. ""Im the guy in the crowd making fun of the heros shirt."" He cant believe hes living in an era when a facial wound is treated by having a blue jay peck away the blood. Equally exasperated is Anna (Charlize Theron) a sharpshooting cynic who strikes up a relationship with Albert without mentioning that her husband (Liam Neeson) is a desperado who kills indiscriminately. Unlike a lot of wiseguy comedies the movie provides ample opportunity for the supporting cast to be more than straight men Neil Patrick Harris does nice work as a mustachioed snob who steals Alberts girlfriend (Amanda Seyfried). She is starting to realize the range of possibilities now that ""people are living to 35."" Sarah Silverman and Giovanni Ribisi in a scene from ""A Million Ways to Die in the West.""Photo AP Even better are Sarah Silverman and Giovanni Ribisi as a Christian couple who are waiting to get married before they have sex. Hes a virgin. Shes the skankiest hooker west of the Rio Grande. Many of the requisite gross-out gags involve her professional life and though I tend to reject bodily emissions humor MacFarlanes crew does find some surprising uses for it that fit the films absurdist irreverent vibe. Warning If they gave out triple-R ratings this movie would have one. ""West"" is a bit slowly paced and probably should have been trimmed by 15 minutes or so. Still its easy to see why MacFarlane loves these jokes so much he couldnt bear to cut them. Even a third-act dream sequence that at first seems like filler does pays off as do the random celebrity cameos (Ryan Reynolds is my favorite) and thrown-in cultural references that define ""Family Guy"" (and ""The Simpsons""). At his best MacFarlane delivers funny new takes on the strangest aspects of frontier life -- the weirdly stiff photos the constant accidents the shoddy medicine the dances -- and the movies about same. The score (by Joel McNeely) is a ringer for 60s cowpoke epics and MacFarlane has a brilliant tip on how to survive a saloon brawl. Through the eyes of a comic master even boredom can be funny In olden days ""theres only like three songs and theyre all by Stephen Foster.""

Hes gathered an all-star cast including Charlize Theron and Liam Neeson to headline this comedy about how hard life was in the old west. Bill Goodykoontz USA TODAY NETWORK 1043 a.m. MST May 29 2014Seth MacFarlane takes a genuinely interesting premise about how the Old West was a cesspool of disease and despair and buries it (and his talented cast) under a pile of unfunny gross-out jokes.Seth MacFarlane plays a sheep farmer in ""A Million Ways to Die in the West.""(Photo Universal Studios)Story HighlightsCritics review 2 starsThe idea that the Old West was a miserable brutal place is good but the movie is not.MacFarlanes comedy is not funny enough to justify its offensiveness.He assembles an outstanding willing cast but wastes it.Humor forgives a lot. But it has to be you know funny.Seth MacFarlane in ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" would have done well to remember that. He takes a genuinely interesting premise and a first-rate cast and does what he always does Make rude jokes. Offensive jokes. Stupid jokes. And every now and then a funny joke.But it isnt enough. Offensive humor can be really funny. But if youre going to be really offensive you have to be really funny and ""A Million Ways to Die"" just isnt.NEW June movie guideMacFarlane directs stars in and helped write the film so if youre going to blame someone well ...The idea is actually pretty brilliant. Weve seen a ton of Westerns in which the West is portrayed as a pristine pure antidote to the evils of the big city. Even ""All the Kings Men"" Robert Penn Warrens seminal novel buys into the theory ""It is just where you go.""MacFarlane turns this notion on its ear. The film is set in Arizona in the 19th century and Albert (MacFarlane) a wimpy sheep farmer constantly bemoans what a miserable place it is. There is disease poverty rampant alcoholism senseless violence wild animals the threat of Indian attack and more. Albert is determined to prove the veracity of the films title.Charlize Theron and Seth MacFarlane in a scene from ""A Million Ways to Die in the West."" (Photo Universal Pictures)That could make for a really funny movie.This isnt it.2014 Summer movie guideAlbert spends much of his time complaining to his friend Edward (Giovanni Ribisi) and Edwards girlfriend Ruth (Sarah Silverman) a prostitute. (The running joke is that she has sex 10 times on a slow day but never with Edward because theyre Christians.) The only thing Albert has going for him is his girlfriend Louise (Amanda Seyfried) -- until she dumps him for Foy (Neil Patrick Harris) who runs a mustache store. (Yes. Just go with it.)Then one day Anna (Charlize Theron) rides into town. Shes beautiful and mysterious and after Albert saves her from a bar fight she determines to help him become more manly maybe even a hero. The downside of all this is that unbeknownst to everyone in town shes actually the wife of Clinch (Liam Neeson) the baddest bad guy in the territory.At this point you perhaps have noticed the pile of talented actors MacFarlane has assembled here. Whats more theyre willing to do anything for laughs Theron in particular. But too often they seem involved in a fruitless search for those laughs. Or maybe watching Harris suffer explosive diarrhea in a hat is your idea of hilarious.Foy (Neil Patrick Harris) and his rival Albert (Seth MacFarlane) in ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"". (Photo Universal Pictures)As with any Western worth its spurs theres a showdown brewing. It takes awhile to get there -- at almost two hours the movie is too long -- and its not all that satisfying once it arrives. But thats OK. MacFarlane isnt trying to make a traditional Western. Hes trying to parody one. He can hide behind that while rolling out some of the truly offensive bits a couple of which seem like booby traps to goad the politically correct into complaining. (Guilty as charged.) A cameo at the tail end of the movie is inspired funny and almost forgives one of these. Almost.So yes this is a complaint that MacFarlanes film is too broad too dumb too offensive to justify the meager laughs it generates. In related news the sun rises in the east tomorrow. Some things you can count on and the vapid nature of ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" is one of them.Review A Million Ways to Die in the West 2 starsDirector Seth MacFarlane.Cast Seth MacFarlane Charlize Theron Liam Neeson.Rating R for strong crude and sexual content language throughout some violence and drug material.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Not just because his breakneck absurdist humor often demands that viewers pause and rewind but because the man himself looks like a hand-inked cartoon with his black pupil-less eyes and an alabaster baby face that lacking cheekbones that could carve in some shadows appears to reflect light like the moon. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - MacFarlane is the closest thing weve got to Mel Brooks a manic comic who empties a six-shooter at the screen in every scene hoping that at least a couple bullets hit.MacFarlane wrote directed and stars in the ruthlessly funny A Million Ways to Die in the West yet despite it being head-to-tail his project he sometimes feels layered on top of the film like Roger Rabbit on a live-action world. Oddly or perhaps cannily that works to his advantage. His character a bachelor shepherd named Albert doesnt want to fit into 1882 Arizona a nasty place where people can and do die from snakes cholera bulls fast-moving tumbleweeds exploding daguerreotypes falling ice blocks bad medicine flatulence and of course each other. Groans Albert ""We should all just wear coffins for clothes.""Film DetailsCritics Pick A Million Ways to Die in the West RatingR GenreComedy Running Time116 min. More Info Trailer This is the most unromantic take on the Wild West since John Wayne in The Searchers vowed to kill his niece. Everyone is dumb dirty superstitious and violent. Pre-mass media and seemingly pre-literacy the townspeople are so ignorant that Gilbert Gottfried is able to pass himself off as Abraham Lincoln. Worst of all lifes boring. Even children playing with hoops and sticks is deemed mental overstimulation.The only cheery bits are the opening-credits music which sounds borrowed from a Disneyland parade and Sarah Silvermans fresh-scrubbed prostitute a Christian whose virgin boyfriend (Giovanni Ribisi) doesnt mind that shes making him and him alone wait for marriage. You cant have a Western without a whore -- theyre as intrinsic to the genre as horses -- but Silverman manages to make the role feel novel even though its the natural outgrowth of her persona as the worlds filthiest chipmunk.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm MacFarlane makes no pretense of accuracy especially not linguistic. When Albert gets dumped by shallow schoolmarm Louise (Amanda Seyfried) for the rich bigwig who runs a mustache store (Neil Patrick Harris) she chirps ""I have to work on myself"" a phrase more commonly heard over kale salads in Beverly Hills. Albert himself speaks like an impatient time traveler from the future. Explaining Parkinsons disease he pauses and adjusts himself ""Its just another way that God mysteriously shows that he loves us.""Hes had enough. But on the night Albert plans to flee Arizona for the comparatively cultured San Francisco he befriends traveling tomboy beauty Anna (Charlize Theron) who convinces him to stick around for a week. With his heart still set on Louise and Anna secretly married to a murderous outlaw (Liam Neeson) the pair are free to do something truly unusual for any Hollywood genre pal around as platonic friends. (At least for a while.)Theron proved her comedy chops in the underrated Young Adult and here she and MacFarlane get along like two eager puppies. If MacFarlane indulges in self-flattery by keeping in all the times this babe bursts into laughter at his jokes hes forgiven; at least we feel like the characters are actually listening to each other. The Oscar-winning actress isnt given a huge range of things to do but she does them well even selling us on her characters slow-building crush on MacFarlane. No small feat given that he looked more natural kissing a human in Ted when his disembodied voice was shoved inside a teddy bear.Its hard to pin down how MacFarlane conceives of himself. ""Im not the hero"" Albert insists. ""Im the guy in the crowd making fun of the heros shirt."" But MacFarlane cant resist trying do to both as if deep inside himself he wants to be a real boy after all -- an actor who might conceivably one day be cast in a movie without a fart joke.Will audiences let him? Debatable.At least hes the closest thing weve got to Mel Brooks a manic comic who empties a six-shooter at the screen in every scene hoping that at least a couple bullets hit.Still A Million Ways to Die in the West feels softer than Brooks Blazing Saddles in part because MacFarlane is aiming at an easier target. Blazing Saddles released in 1974 -- the same year as Foxy Brown -- used the Western as a guise to attack racism. MacFarlane is merely attacking the Wild West itself and were all in agreement that it was a terrible place to live -- even our modern ranchers are mapping their livestock with Google Earth.If MacFarlane really wants to burn his brand on one of our cultures sacred cows hes chosen the wrong John Wayne genre.

Theyll say that the many F-bombs are just a cheap attempt to punch up punchless dialogue. Theyll find little cleverness in MacFarlanes attempts to satirize the Old West because so much of the material is cliched and obvious (and not in a way that successfully satirizes movie cliches). Theyll pooh-pooh MacFarlane as a nonactor whose protagonist is too whiny to be any sort of hero even in a comedy.On the other side will be the viewers who arent afraid of lowbrow humor and like that director and co-writer MacFarlane who shares screenwriting credits with Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild mixes in just enough cleverness with the foul-mouthed infantile jokes. An overwhelming chunk of this crowd will be young men not old enough to remember Mel Brooks or say the underrated more subtle 1985 comedy ""Rustlers Rhapsody.""I get both sides though Ive seen far too many lowbrow comedies that worked beautifully to get much out of ""A Million Ways to Die in the West."" While I can appreciate some of the well-worn gags here (I too have wondered why no one in the 19th century was allowed to smile in photographs) I didnt find myself actually laughing until the movie was about three-quarters done. By then it was too late.Advertisement MacFarlane plays Albert Stark a smart but cowardly Arizona sheep farmer in 1882. His devotion to mediocrity drives his girlfriend and town hottie Louise (Amanda Seyfried) into the arms of Foy the dapper owner of the towns moustachery (Neil Patrick Harris who as usual looks like hes enjoying every minute). As Albert MacFarlane misses more than he connects. Its almost as if he doesnt think his jokes are funny enough and has to push until the audience winces. The idea of Sarah Silverman playing a prostitute saving herself for her boyfriend Edward (Giovanni Ribisi) until theyre married is funny -- until we have to endure a misplaced body fluids joke (that was funny once and only once in ""Theres Something About Mary""). Alberts luck changes when Anna (Charlize Theron) wife of the territorys most notorious villain Clinch Leatherwood (played with little inspiration by Liam Neeson) hides out in town. Therons Anna is refreshingly natural. She takes Albert under her wing to prepare him for a big gunfight and of course falls for him setting up the big conflict once Clinch hits town. This image released by Universal Pictures shows Seth MacFarlane in a scene from ""A Million Ways to Die in the West."" (AP Photo/Universal Pictures) A few funny bits appear along the way (excitement over real paper money a random bull wreaking havoc a well-placed cameo from the star of a huge 1980s film). But those moments are swamped by gags about feces urinating slavery and anal sex and some skull-crushing violence. I get it -- Seth MacFarlane specializes in clever lowbrow humor. But as shown in his animated TV series ""Family Guy"" MacFarlane is best when he challenges his own imagination instead of merely settling for the lowest common denominator. So many of the bits in ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" feel like they were just jammed into the script at the last minute.Strangely things take a sharp turn toward movies end once Albert gets captured by Indians and the drugs kick in (Alberts not MacFarlanes though one never knows). Suddenly the satire becomes sharper and MacFarlanes weird imagination produces the movies most hilarious scenes by far. But its too little too late. If MacFarlane was hoping to make a new generations ""Blazing Saddles"" he failed amid an avalanche of dumb. Next time he should use the good jokes first and build from there.Contact Tony Hicks at Facebook.com/BayAreaNewsGroup.TonyHicks or Twitter.com/insertfoot.Print Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Review Holocaust haunts family in The GatheringReview In Hearts of Palm bumbling corporation aims to plunder paradiseReview In Bad Moms fast food and booze spike the stress of motherhood Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

Gross-out comedy about a cowardly cowboy. Director Seth MacFarlane (156). R Language sexuality violence drugs crude humor. Area theaters. Seth MacFarlane triumphed with his 2012 comedy ""Ted"" so he then decided he would not only co-write direct and produce his next movie hed star in it as well. And thats the problem with ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" There was no one on set to lasso MacFarlanes lesser instincts. So while you watch this comic Western -- and even while you laugh at its funnier moments -- your mind will wander back to ""Ted"" and youll realize that the key to that movies success wasnt the titular teddy bear (despite being perfectly voiced by MacFarlane) but star Mark Wahlberg. Unlike MacFarlane Wahlberg is a pro who knows how -- and equally important when -- to cede center stage. MacFarlane lacks Wahlbergs professional experience so he makes the movie all about his character Albert. The central joke is that Albert approaches life with the observational snark of a 2014 hipster even though hes a shepherd in 1882 Arizona. As such hes perpetually appalled by the endless dangers surrounding him -- rattlesnakes bar brawls poison gases toxic food. Things only get worse when his girlfriend (Amanda Seyfried) begins dating the towns nastiest dandy (Neil Patrick Harris) and Albert must duel for his own honor. Fortunately a mysterious stranger (Charlize Theron) offers to help him prepare for the gunfight -- though unbeknownst to Albert shes married to the infamous and very possessive outlaw Clinch (Liam Neeson). Charlize Therons a mysterious stranger with star Seth MacFarlane in A Million Ways to Die in the West. (Lorey Sebastian) From left Amanda Seyfried Neil Patrick Harris Seth MacFarlane and Charlize Theron in A Million Ways to Die in the West (Lorey Sebastian) Giovanni Ribisi and Sarah Silverman in A Million Ways to Die in the West (lorey sebastian) Giovanni Ribisi and Seth MacFarlane are pals in A Million Ways to Die in the West. (Lorey Sebastian) MacFarlane has corralled a great cast which makes it especially disappointing that the movies merely OK. There are some amusing jokes -- a Christopher Lloyd cameo is the highlight -- but MacFarlane ultimately relies too much on gross-out gags with no great payoff. Michael Barretts desert cinematography and Joel McNeelys orchestral score aptly evoke the genre even while tweaking it. And the supporting actors -- including Giovanni Ribisi as Alberts best friend and Sarah Silverman as a naive prostitute -- are uniformly fine. But all these first-rate performers are pushed to the sidelines so the movies creator can also be its undisputed leading man. Unfortunately he doesnt yet have the generosity required to build any real connections to the character his co-stars or the audience which is left with a giant hole where there should be some heart. In the end Alberts biggest problem isnt the threat of coyotes or cholera. Its that hes being played by the wrong guy. eweitzmannydailynews.com Tags movies movie reviews a million ways to die in the west seth macfarlane charlize theron liam neeson amanda seyfried neil patrick harris christopher lloyd giovanni ribisi sarah silverman comedy Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

His ingratiating personality reminds me of half the kids I knew at my Jesuit high school but way smoother. Unlike most comedians and comic writers he gives the appearance of having no inner demons to wrestle; his smile suggests a man at ease with himself and his outsize success. Hed be an excellent dinner-party guest scrupulously attending to each of his table partners (10 minutes to the right 10 minutes to the left) and if you asked him enlivening the cognac hour by singing a Jimmy Van Heusen standard in his big-band-vocalist baritone. What I dont find MacFarlane is funny. Family Guy and his other Fox cartoon shows tend to choke on the glut of their pop-culture references and his gig last year as the Oscar host found him practically strangled by his smarty-pants tone. Now he births A Million Ways to Die in the West a sagebrush comedy whose visual grandeur and appealing actors get polluted by some astonishingly lazy writing. The lovely exception on MacFarlanes resume is Ted which he directed and co-wrote supplying the voice of the talking toy bear. That 2012 comedy got pretty close to profundity in its take on the joys and limitations of male bonding. It portrayed the friendship of underachiever Mark Wahlberg and his childhood pal Ted as an infantile attraction that could last a sweet lifetime. The laughs came like Teds voice from inside the characters. By my definition thats good comedy. (READ Mary Pols Review of Ted) Made for a reasonable 50 million and grossing 10 times more at the global box office Ted gave MacFarlane carte blanche for his follow-up. Ask almost any guy whos made a hit movie what he wants to do next and the answer will likely be a western. Thats where Michael Cimino went after The Deer Hunter Barry Sonnenfeld after Men in Black Jon Favreau after two Iron Man hits and Gore Verbinski after three Pirates of the Caribbean blockbusters. The results -- Heavens Gate Wild Wild West Cowboys amp; Aliens and The Lone Ranger -- served to prove that the western is a genre cherished by all moviemakers and almost no current moviegoers. A Million Ways to Die fights that audience indifference -- and loses. MacFarlane plays Albert a sheep farmer in Old Stump Ariz. whos good at nothing except getting into trouble. The opening Main Street gunfight of three in the movie shows Albert sort of talking his way out of being shot down by a bad guy -- by promising to pay the varmint the money owed him. A few days later Albert says hes made good on the debt though theres no indication of where he got the dough he didnt have before. (READ Four New Westerns at the Cannes Film Festival) This is the first of countless examples 0f MacFarlane and his co-writers Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild (who also worked on Family Guy and Ted) tossing a plot idea in the air and as if with a comics version of ADHD not caring where it lands. (""Squirrel"") Similarly the opening narration by a voice reminiscent of Sam Elliotts in The Big Lebowski has no reason for existing unless it is to pay off later. But its dropped like so many of the films comic opportunities. Albert loves the pretty Louise (Amanda Seyfried) for the same reason MacFarlane loves the western because hes always loved what hes not suited for. But Louise has grown fond of Neil Patrick Harris Foy -- his first name must be ""F--ing"" since thats what Albert usually calls him -- who runs the towns flourishing mustachery and sports a curlicue lip toupee that even Salvador Dali would envy. That leaves Albert available to save the life of newcomer Anna (Charlize Theron) in a bar brawl. Mysterious of provenance but willing to teach Albert marksmanship for his impending middle-of-the-movie showdown with Foy Anna becomes attracted to the sheepman. But Anna is the restless wife and fellow traveler of the notorious bandit Clinch Leatherwood (Liam Neeson) who will invade Old Stump toward the end for the films third shootout. (READ The Long Life Death and Rebirth of the Western) The minor surprise is that the movie works pretty well as a western romance. MacFarlane with the unlined unremarkable good looks of a 40s B-movie swain plays nicely off Therons all-American (if native South African) glamour. Alone among the players she projects a cagey warmth true both to her character and to a zillion tough but tender ladies from old westerns. But others in the cast have little to do. Giovanni Ribisi is the town virgin engaged to Sarah Silverman the town whore -- and they wont have sex before marriage because ""Were Christians"" as the lustrously Jewish Silverman says twice. Maybe we didnt get it the first time. In a movie with a hundred rude sight gags the few good ones can be attributed to the stunt team a huge ice block that drops on a worker and crushes his head; a saloon cowboy who falls over dead his face colliding with and overturning a tabletop. Theres an indecent laugh with a county-fair Runaway Slave Shooting Gallery -- too soon after 12 Years a Slave? -- and an O.K. point-of-view shot of Albert getting urinated on by one of his sheep that would have worked better in 3-D. Even by these low standards though most of the stabs at humor miss their mark. Matching Mel Brooks immortal Blazing Saddles only in its plethora of fart and poop jokes -- one good one a man with diarrhea shouts ""Ow That came out of my penis"" -- A Million Ways to Die both fills and wastes time with joke cameos by Christopher Guest Gilbert Gottfried and Jamie Foxx as well as inside gags about his leading ladies. (An Indian language includes the phrase Mila Kunis -- the co-star of Ted -- and Anna asks Louise ""How can you be so blind with eyes that big?"" Seyfried is the female lead in next years Ted 2.) (READ Richard Schickels 1974 Review of Blazing Saddles) On The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon recently MacFarlane read some fake newspaper headlines panning his movie. The Miami Herald ""Boy Blunder Farts His Way to Failure in Worst Western."" The New York Times ""A Million Ways Sophomoric Fart Fest; Grand Budapest Hotel Best Thing Ever in the History of Things."" It happens that The Grand Budapest Hotel is a wonderful movie and A Million Ways to Die in the West is a sophomoric sophomore effort from an ingratiating actor-writer-director. Sometimes telling a joke on yourself is the truest funniest biggest laugh a likable guy can get.

Review What Does Seth MacFarlanes A Million Ways to Die in the West Tell Us About the State of the Western? Eric Kohn May 28 2014 1036 am erickohn Share This Article Pin It Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Print Talk Seth MacFarlane is the most paradoxical mainstream entertainer working today. The extreme popularity of his discursive comedy in ""Family Guy"" and its various spin-offs has steadily overtaken the mantle of primetime animation once held strong by ""The Simpsons"" while MacFarlane has similarly managed to pervade the live action arena with 2012s breakout comedy ""Ted."" Hes widely appreciated as a major comedic figure with the uncanny ability to smuggle a mixture of highbrow and lowbrow references (from Nikita Kruschev to Jerry Lewis) through a filter of cheap sophomoric toilet humor. That strength is also his weakness Everything about MacFarlanes silly technique relies on the power of the things preceding it. Thats certainly the case with his latest feature-length effort ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" a lightweight attempt to emulate the satiric approach to the Western genre already perfected by Mel Brooks with ""Blazing Saddles."" MacFarlane cant compete so he doesnt even try. Starring the writer-director in the lead role of a sheep farmer struggling to win back his girl in the wild frontier of Arizona circa 1882 the movie features MacFarlanes typical joke-a-minute method with the occasional non-ironic stab at emotion or action sequence to satisfy his base of college stoners eager to embrace the freewheeling style. Its like the comedian has sped through the sets of countless Westerns comedy guns blasting away to the baffled amusement of anyone willing to pay attention. That tendency to blindly embrace MacFarlanes sloppiness has made him a very successful man but with so many random attempts to make his audience laugh its no surprise that some of the jokes actually land. In ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" MacFarlane loads up enough zaniness to make for a generally enjoyable mashup particularly because the genial plot affords him a solid backdrop. Unlike the inane premise of ""Ted"" in which the prospects of a foul-mouthed teddy bear can only go so far  ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" develops a reasonably engaging premise involving the efforts by klutzy sheepherder Albert (MacFarlane) to win back his girl Louise (Amanda Seyfried) with the assistance of curious drifter Anna (Charlize Theron) whos the secretly the wife of dangerous bandit Clinch (Liam Neeson). The story is beside the point but provides enough coherence to prevent MacFarlanes relentless goofiness from devolving into incoherence. MacFarlanes talented cast plays along. While Anna helps Albert gain confidence he copes with constant mockery from Louises newest suitor (Neil Patrick Harris). While MacFarlanes bland delivery fits his everyman character Harris frequently steals the show as a cartoonish villain giddy over his excessive mustache with the obsession extending to a bedroom gag and one ridiculously catchy song. But its Theron who truly wrestles control of the material giving her tough-minded anti-hero a touch of the individualistic attitude she last displayed in ""Young Adult"" in this case elevating it to bawdy excesses. Populating her dialogue with f-bombs galore shes like every repressed damsel in distress from the Western canon dead-set on revenge at once. However MacFarlane deserves credit for the effectiveness of several gonzo digressions several of which are genuinely funny. A prolonged drug sequence involving floating sheep and vulture testicles marks the closest thing to a virtuoso piece of filmmaking he has done. Add in a couple of standout celebrity cameos (Christopher Lloyd with his DeLorean time machine Gilbert Gottfried as a hilarious Abraham Lincoln) plus Sarah Silverman in a supporting role as a dirty prostitute unwilling to sleep with her partner before marriage a recurring joke about the absence of smiles in old photographs and an entire town shocked by the sight of a dollar bill -- and ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" has enough wit to justify its limited appeal. MacFarlane is so eager to please that its hard not to get swept up in his efforts. Nevertheless ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" is weakened by MacFarlanes usual problems with half-baked and mean-spirited wisecracks. There are the usual throwaway jokes about pedophilia and fat people not to mention innumerable fart jokes in which the farting isnt a punchline but the joke itself. (One prolonged shit-in-the-hat sequence involving laxatives marks the directors brazen attempt to outdo ""Blazing Saddles"" which isnt worth the effort.) ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" lacks the inspired lunacy of Mel Brooks timeless Western and wont last the ages as a seminal swipe at the genre but at least MacFarlane gives the lark a point. His title refers to the expansive dangers of the Wild West which his character outlines in an amusingly extensive monologue early on chronicling dangers that include the prescription of an ""ear nail"" for the common cold and the sight of the towns mayor lying dead in plain sight for days. The Western is the only distinctive genre to both celebrates the countrys iconography and tap into its darker ingredients which allows MacFarlane to assail American identity more coherently than he has before. Of course that may have more to do with the Westerns lasting power than MacFarlanes eagerness to horse around with it. ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" is notably hitting theaters in the immediate aftermath of the Cannes Film Festival where no less than four movies riffed on the Western formula. READ MORE Is Tommy Lee Jones The Homesman the Strangest Movie In Competition at Cannes? Chief among them Tommy Lee Jones ""The Homesman"" delivered a much more sophisticated range of humor among its peculiar tonal shifts in its irreverent tale of a pioneer woman (Hilary Swank) attempting to transport a trio of crazy housewives with the efforts of a rascally drifter (Jones). Though not every twist in ""The Homesman"" works Jones does manage to take an inventive approach with the genre by exploring its implicit misogyny over the ages. Then theres ""The Rover"" Australian director David Michods uneven post-apocalyptic tale involving the plight of a squinty-eyed badass (Guy Pearce) as he attempts to recover his stolen vehicle. Michod uses the barren dusty Western landscape to explore the absence of traditional morals at the edges of civilization. That outlook takes on more compelling dimensions in the South America-set ""El Ardor"" in which Gael Garcia Bernal embodies the traditional Man With No Name figure in the middle of the rain forest implying that the lawless realm found in countless oaters has traveled elsewhere. And in the heavily stylized ""The Salvation""  Mads Mikkelsen stars as a lone shooter on a mission for revenge that reduces the Western to its bare essentials. READ MORE Robert Pattinson and Guy Pearce Cant Quite Salvage David Michods The Rover None of these movies have been deemed rousing successes but collectively they reflect an intriguing effort to think through the values and creative possibilities afforded by a genre that has routinely explored American mythology from the inside out. From John Fords patriotic visions to the allegorical dimensions of the Cold War-era ""High Noon"" and the Vietnam analogies of Clint Eastwoods best efforts the Western has always offered meaty fodder for wresting with relevant attitudes. MacFarlanes work has never aimed that high -- but love him or hate him he still ranks as one of Americas most prominent storytellers so its no surprise that he would tackle this prototypical American tradition. If anyone can rejuvenate the commercial prospects of the Western its him; whether it needed his clumsy broad strokes with so many fresher approaches in the pipeline presents a different question. If the Western will survive with quality intact theres no doubting that the substantial efforts will migrate to the sidelines much like the iconography of the Western itself. In ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" the humor only goes so far. But if this is the final frontier for the studio-produced Western there are worst fates than to go down than a barrage of shits and giggles.

TWITTER Seth MacFarlane stars in and directs the Western comedy. Seth MacFarlane mightve picked a safer place to make his lead-acting debut than A Million Ways to Die in the West his directorial follow-up to 2012s surprisingly successful Ted. The marketplace doesnt seem to be crying out for Westerns after all -- be they earnest revivals satires or genre hybrids involving extra-terrestrials -- and the undeniably of-his-moment MacFarlane is as the script indirectly admits a strange fit for the genre. Stocking the supporting cast with top-drawer talent he gives most of his costars little to do besides attract our attention on movie posters; that ruse might yield some results on opening weekend but wont be able to carry the picture to the kind of profitability enjoyed by Ted. PHOTOS A Million Ways to Die in the West Premiere A winking mid-film cameo prompts viewers to wonder how MacFarlane might have fared playing a time-traveler from our era stranded in the Old West. Instead his 1880s sheep farmer Albert Stark simply talks like someone born in and transplanted from the 20th century. ""We live in a terrible place and time"" Albert tells friends Edward (Giovanni Ribisi) and Ruth (Sarah Silverman) assessing his surroundings as if seeing medical and social realities through our eyes. There are too many ways to die out here he laments -- though most of the shock-violence gags the movie employs demonstrate the risks not of living in an age before modern medicine but of inhabiting a world whose authors arent terribly gifted at slapstick. Dumped by his longtime sweetheart Louise (Amanda Seyfried) Albert is about ready to leave town when he meets Anna (Charlize Theron) a newcomer who appreciates his gentle personality in a way locals dont. Perhaps thats because shes secretly betrothed to the meanest cuss in these parts a bandit called Clinch (Liam Neeson) who has sent her here to hide out while he dodges the law for a spell. (The preceding sentence contains more Western-ese than the entire script MacFarlane wrote with Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild which instead dates itself with lines like ""Oh snap"" ""Oh no I did-uhnt"" and ""douche."") STORY Inside the Million Ways to Die in the West Premiere While Albert frets about Louises new romance with fancy-pants shopkeeper Foy (Neil Patrick Harris whose vain moustache-tonic merchant is a reliable laugh-getter) Anna takes an inexplicable interest in helping him stand up for himself. Why? Though MacFarlane eventually demonstrates a knack for low-key flirty humor Alberts appeal at the start of their friendship is hard to see. One assumes Anna knows how much money Ted will make in 130 or so years and wants to get in on the ground floor. In a rare display of nerve Albert challenges Foy to a duel; as Anna offers him the gunslinger lessons that will inevitably lead to love the films supporting cast all but vanishes from the film. (Just as well perhaps as the screenplay is about to run out of ways to poke fun at the fact that Alberts buddy Edward is a virgin in a chaste relationship with Ruth the towns busiest whore.) The romance plot could hardly be more familiar but at least it plays out against a landscape so dramatic one almost suspects the filmmakers composited a few extra sandstone formations into Monument Valley. Theron carries almost all the weight here given her partners unexpected blandness which makes it vaguely insulting when the third act turns her into a helpless damsel in need of his rescue. FILM REVIEW Blended Though the film is hardly laugh-free its uneven jokes appear to have breezed through a very forgiving editing process. ""You really shouldnt drink and horse"" Edward tells a soused Albert as he heads out on horseback -- a bizarre turn of phrase that presumably sounded funnier to somebody than the more sense-making ""drink and ride."" The leave-it-all-in approach leads to a nearly two-hour running time that looks all the more indulgent given how much invention Blazing Saddles packed into an hour-and-a-half.

But as creator Seth MacFarlane could tell you for a comedian theres only one way to die Be unfunny. He had a taste of mortality hosting the Oscars two years ago when some of his jokes didnt just offend but -- worse -- fell flat. And he certainly knew he was risking a lot with this new movie a comedy western. Well -- dodged a bullet. Because ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" is yes often offensive and juvenile. (Its Seth MacFarlane after all.) But its also often funny and even occasionally pretty clever. Starring in his own script MacFarlane plays Albert an intelligent and smartly cautious man whos somehow ended up as a sheepherder in the Wild West. Which he hates with almost as much passion as he loves his schoolmarm girlfriend Louise. But she leaves him for a rich man and it seems as if things couldnt get much worse. Except then the territorys worst gunslinger passes through and his wife begins to take a shine to this shy shepherd. And suddenly things do indeed get a whole lot worse. MacFarlane who directs as well isnt the most obvious movie star. With his pleasant but inexpressive face and shoe-button eyes he looks a little like ""Ted"" the dirty teddy bear he created (he talks like him too) -- cuddly but unengaged. The movie also misses out on a nice joke by having everyone sound alike -- which is to say like the same foul-mouthed 21st-century cynic. It keeps Albert from standing out; itd be funnier if everyone but he spoke with florid 19th-century style. But MacFarlane is game for pratfalls and he has a good supporting cast around him including Neil Patrick Harris as a romantic rival Sarah Silverman as a perpetually upbeat hooker Liam Neeson as that dreaded gunslinger and a few surprise guest stars -- including one post-credits one -- whose identities Ill keep secret here. He also has a secret weapon in Charlize Theron who showed her taste for rude comedy in ""Young Adult"" but hasnt gotten much of a chance since. Here as the gunmans wife she cuts a confident eye-catching figure (and occasionally uncorks a terrific dirty laugh) while still rooting her character in reality. N.J.

As a comedian MacFarlane often cant help going for the gross-out joke. There barely a bodily fluid that not only gets its own gag but gag-worthy closeup too; his slightly self-conscious Im-a-bad-boy act also includes the usual non-PC tweaks at race and religion. But as a filmmaker he shows a real appreciation for genre (the movie starts with shots of John Fords beloved desert landscapes and a rolling Elmer Bernstein-style score). Some flashes of style too particularly in a psychedelic dream out of Dali and some clever in-jokes. Admitted for all its wild satire and crude humor ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" is no ""Blazing Saddles"" (although it does share a fondness for jokes about passing gas); only briefly does it risk going as fearlessly over the comedy cliff as Mel Brooks did regularly. But its well-made often (and outrageously) funny and manages to keep up the pace and interest for nearly two hours. Clearly theres more to MacFarlane than a bad Oscar show ""Ted"" and some Fox-TV toons. Itll be fun to see what he finds funny next. Ratings note The film contains strong language sexual situations brief nudity substance abuse and violence. A Million Ways to Die in the West (R) Universal (113 min.) Directed by Seth MacFarlane.

The saddles dont blaze in ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" and the pacing is limper than a three-legged horse. In following up his 2012 smash ""Ted"" with a lavish comic Western Seth MacFarlane has delivered a flaccid all-star farce thats handsomely dressed up with nowhere to go for most of its padded two-hour running time. Pic faces a formidable box office duel in its opening frame against Disneys costly ""Maleficent"" but regardless of the outcome there it wont come within striking distance of ""Teds"" 549 million global gold rush. While it may be too tall an order to expect MacFarlane to deliver at the level of classic Mel Brooks (or Quentin Tarantino) ""A Million Ways"" fails to measure up to even its own creators high standard for nose-thumbing irreverence. Indeed from ""Family Guy"" to ""Ted"" weve come to expect the 40-year-old wunderkind to go for broke and when he fails to go down swinging (as in his valiant but misjudged paean to Hollywood cleavage at the 2013 Oscars). What you dont expect from MacFarlane is a genteel weightless genre parody that even with its de rigueur parade of dick and fart jokes is unlikely to offend anyone born after the gunfight at the O.K. Corral. But thats exactly what MacFarlane serves up in this tale of a nebbish sheep farmer who falls for a gorgeous moll and finds his inner gunslinger in the process. When we first meet him MacFarlanes Albert Stark has just weaseled his way out of a gunfight in the 1880s frontier town of Old Stump Ariz. and been promptly dumped by girlfriend Louise (Amanda Seyfried) who already has her doe eyes set on the towns cocky ""mustachery"" impresario Foy (Neil Patrick Harris the ends of his stache pomaded into airtight curls). So a disconsolate Albert returns to the family homestead and tends to his disobedient flock until chance brings him face to face with strapping new-girl-in-town Anna (Charlize Theron) who fails to mention that shes actually the wife of the most feared bandit for miles around Clinch Leatherwood (Liam Neeson). Much of ""A Million Ways"" devotes itself to Alberts efforts to win back the hand of his erstwhile lady love though its a measure of the movies lazy writing (by MacFarlane and co-scribes Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild) that Louise never materializes enough as a character for us to understand what drew Albert to her in the first place. Having impulsively challenged Foy to a duel the gun-shy Albert gets a crash course in marksmanship from crack shot Anna -- a ""Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head""-style montage during which one senses teacher and student developing more than a mere educational bond. And its largely thanks to the wonderfully loose sassy Theron that the film stays as engaging as it does for as long as it does. Theron isnt given much to do here but she makes the most of it which is more than can be said for Giovanni Ribisi and Sarah Silverman who seem trapped in the ninth circle of comic hell as a virginal shoemaker and the prostitute girlfriend who refuses to sleep with him before their wedding night. Watching ""A Million Ways"" it feels as if MacFarlane fell in love with the idea of doing a comic Western and decided hed worry about the particulars as he went along resulting in a disjointed series of sketches linked together by lovingly photographed Monument Valley panoramas. In one of the movies more inspired bits Albert quells a tense encounter with the Apache leader Cochise (Wes Studi) by demonstrating a mastery of the Indian tongue but MacFarlane almost ruins the joke by following it up with a distended peyote dream sequence during which the movie veers perilously close to an ego-soaked vanity project. Periodically MacFarlane tries to gussy things up with off-color humor that simply feels off (like a ""runaway slave"" shooting gallery at the county fair) and a few gross-out gags that land with bigger thuds than the giant ice block that vividly crushes one characters head into pulp. But nothing in the movie is quite so limiting as the presence of MacFarlane himself in a lead role he proves ill fit to carry. In his first live-action lead he lumbers through the film spouting dialogue that sounds like an extended standup riff about the horrors of the Old West all delivered with a modern ironic-hipster smirk. The effect is not unlike that of seeing Brooks or Woody Allen in their own historical comedies where they continued to ""do"" their patented comic personas even when the setting was the Napoleonic Wars or the Spanish Inquisition. Except that MacFarlane who rose to prominence as an ingenious voice actor proves surprisingly bland in the flesh and his unmodulated delivery eventually runs as dry as the desert sands. The movie benefits from an expensive period look courtesy of production designer Stephen Lineweaver and costume designer Cindy Evans (who dolls Theron up in one particularly memorable green plaid number with an enormous bustle) though MacFarlane seems at a loss visually when he has to stage a barroom brawl or an elaborate folk-dancing sequence. Michael Barretts widescreen cinematography looks crisp by day but has a somewhat milky washed-out quality in the night scenes. A surfeit of unbilled celebrity cameos serves mainly to remind us what cool friends MacFarlane has.

T Cobble says November 17 2014 at 935 am ""A Million Ways To Die In The West"" trailers are grossly misleading as well as being the funniest part of the whole production. There needs to be a new rating to help identify how low and disgusting film-makers minds can be I suggest ""RDP - Regurgitatingly Disgusting Pornography"" The trailers gave nothing about how pornographic the movie is This movie is the most grossly waste of time and money at a comic attempt to be funny You want funny amp; hilarious? The writers producers directors and actors need to take lessons from the master comedian entertainer ""Red Skelton"" who brought audiences to tears of joy and roll in the aisles without a word of filthy vulgar garbage being uttered. This movie comes from the gutter minds it should have stayed in There is nothing artistic funny or redeeming about this movie and its actors. Reply Brad says June 2 2014 at 1013 pm As a huge fan of Family Guy and American Dad I was hugely disappointed with this film. Seth will now become the butt of the very jokes that he aims at his Hollywood peers. With any luck Family Guys Brian will write the review. Reply Rick says June 1 2014 at 748 pm I have lost all respect for anyone associated with this film. Reply Ken says June 1 2014 at 1016 am Wish I had read the reviews before I went. I read an article on Liam Neeson in Cowboys and Indians magazine that made the movie sound like it was of similar quality to Blazing Saddles. How wrong they and I were. MY WIFE AND I WALKED OUT. When we got outside we tried to remember when we had been to a movie so bad that we left and finally concluded it was a first for both of us. And we go to a lot of movies. I thought Liam Neeson and Charlize Theron were to intelligent to get themselves involved in a movie of such low quality. This is a lesson in choosing a movie partially because stars of there capability are in it. I will be more careful next time. Reply Robert P Campbell says May 30 2014 at 514 pm All I know right now is the previews for this movie look awesome. I will see it and hopefully I will like it. I tend to think critics are over cynical anyway and never like any good movies. Reply Russell Edgington says May 30 2014 at 1206 pm Seth MacFarlane smirks just a little too much like hes trying to make his gross out humor palatable because hes such a nice intelligent man-boy or something. Reply dsmith says May 30 2014 at 1202 pm I hated it. I really wanted to like it because of the previews which featured some of the highlights of a painfully unfunny movie. Reply Shawn Dando says May 29 2014 at 327 pm To each your own. Just because this guy dont like it doesnt mean I wont love it. The world needs dick jokes in comedy westerns. Hell we need more comedy westerns. And with Seth Mcfarlane I believe he has enough pizazz and gunth to write Spaceballs 2 (with Mel Brooks Permission) Reply peter says May 28 2014 at 905 pm TED sucked. The best part was when the teddy bear was cut in half and his stuffing fell all over the football field Reply big daddy D says May 28 2014 at 512 pm I love Seth McFarland. Ill see this movie. Maybe Ill laugh my ass off too. Who knows. Reply Rodger Ferguson says May 28 2014 at 123 pm MacFarlanes Oscar song took powerful female performances (a few that even depicted rape) and reduced them to nothing more than an excuse to objectify their bodies. This is the very definition of misogyny. Im all for offensive comedy that challenges and offends our notions of propriety and even Seth MacFarlane has created bits that manage to do this. But ""We Saw Your Boobies"" was not one of those bits. It was objectively horrible and wrong. The fact that Scott Foundas could champion such an indisputably deplorable event as a ""valiant but misjudged paean to Hollywood cleavage"" -- especially in the midst of the anti-women vitriol were seeing in the wake of YesAllWomen and the Elliot Rodgers shooting -- is disturbing and disappointing. The songs subtextual message was ""you can do amazing work and win and Oscar for it but ultimately your still a pair of tts."" Theres nothing valiant about that. Reply Dermot Moloney says May 28 2014 at 339 pm gt;MacFarlanes Oscar song took powerful female performances (a few that even depicted rape) and reduced them to nothing more than an excuse to objectify their bodies. This is the very definition of misogyny. Not really the entire point of the piece was the idea that he was so foolish he had to be told not to go ahead with something that was clearly a bad and wrong idea. Reply Rodger Ferguson says May 30 2014 at 1035 am Putting a ""meta"" spin on an anti-women joke doesnt make it any less anti-women. I could buy your logic if his song had gotten cut off 5 seconds in and the joke really had been about Seth Macfarlane misjudging how his humor would be received. But this wasnt the case. The ""bad idea"" became the main event and the butt of joke shifted from poking fun at Macfarlane to demeaning the work of every talented woman in the room. Imagine applying your same logic if the joke was racist instead of anti-women. Shatner comes from the future and tells Seth ""not to go ahead with something that was clearly a bad and wrong idea"" and then were subjected to a lengthy racist song called ""black people cant act"" where Seth mocks various african-american performances in movies. I dont think youd be championing the brilliant ""meta"" spin Seth put on the racist joke. I think youd just be calling him a racist. thewrittenwordofstutsman says May 28 2014 at 1245 pm Kudos to Seth for trying however I wasnt much of a Ted fan either I think the concept had potential a modern day ""blazing saddles"" type but I think its fallen very short of that. Personally I feel this is a perfect example of when artists stretch themselves too thin and end up loosing more ground as opposed to gaining. Sure there is a certain type of crowd this will appeal too but all-in-all I dont see too much to be proud or boastful about with this film. Sorry ) just my opinion everyones entitled to their own. ) Reply Cowgirl says May 28 2014 at 1245 pm I went to an advance screening of this movie and it was very funny (be warned you will be offended at something in it). It is the best comedy this summer and has more humor than Neighbors and Blended. I actually really like the wardrobe even though it seemed a little polished at times. Charlize Therons character of Anna is my favorite. Reply djl ny says May 28 2014 at 1202 pm was this supposed to be a period film or a modern day romp with ""jokes""? if the former what the hell were they thinking? the leads look as if they simply rolled out of bed. no attempt to recreate the look of a previous time period was jarring at least and most times simply looked as if they didnt have a stylists at all. the few ""attempts"" at a period look appeared to be more of ""PUT CURLS ON THEM that will look old fashioned"" but it s didnt it just pulled focus and was wrong. they should have hired someone that knew what they were doing. walked out of film for the horrid hair alone. Reply Nanny Mo says May 28 2014 at 1009 am And Seth looks old and worn out too poor guy. I saw him in the trailer in a theater. In 4K you could see his crows feet and tired eyes but worse the jokes were his same ole low brow style. If it had been released closer to Christmas at least I could have written ""Bah Humbug."" Reply Dex says May 28 2014 at 817 am The stench of bitter envy is strong on this page. Reply Luis says May 28 2014 at 1142 am seriously ... I actually REALLY enjoyed the movie. Reply facts says May 28 2014 at 1010 am lol Or maybe just that Seth MacFarlane is truly of only limited talent... Reply Todd Jacobs says May 28 2014 at 1007 am No it doesnt seem that way. Reply Joseph Redmond says May 28 2014 at 543 am I assure you folks Im not a psyche  but after several trailers and teasers were on the web I had the same reaction that no comedy classic was at hand. Reply Leon says May 28 2014 at 506 am hahaha so sad. This is the exact same writer who hated Ted when it first came out too. You are such a loser those who cant complain. Reply Dave Baxter says May 28 2014 at 1108 am Ha so I guess that means that you cant even write reviews and are soaking in the bitterest of envies that Scott here gets to write pro reviews when all you can do is complain about them. Youre right that logic actually does make perfect sense Reply Todd Jacobs says May 28 2014 at 1008 am Arent you complaining about the review? Maybe you shouldnt review Scott Foundas. Reply Glenn C. says May 28 2014 at 340 am Looks really really stupid. What a waste of everything Reply Shawn says May 28 2014 at 312 pm If enough people go see the film and it becomes profitable then its a waste of nothing. Movie studios exist solely to make money. If you dont want to see it then stay home. Reply One Who Finds Seth Seriously Unfunny says May 28 2014 at 700 pm Trust me I will. Austen says May 28 2014 at 422 am Nice contribution there bud.

And lest I be accused of priggishness let me go on the record as saying that for me the biggest laugh in MacFarlanes ""Ted"" involved a hookers bowel movement. See video A Million Ways to Die in the West Red Band Trailer Is a Bloody Thrill Ride ""A Million Ways"" sees the popular small-screen jokester behind ""Family Guy"" and ""The Cleveland Show"" making his on-screen debut as a leading man after supplying his voice to the title character of ""Ted"" but it also shows that while MacFarlane is capable of the smart unexpected punchline he more frequently settles for lazy jokes about human functions. Sometimes theyre shocking but theyre rarely as funny as the moments where people randomly fall victim to disease immolation or sudden bull-goring. MacFarlane stars as Albert a cowardly sheep rancher and fast-talking yellow-belly of the Bob Hope/Woody Allen school. After worming his way out of a gunfight his girlfriend Louise (Amanda Seyfriend) dumps him and immediately takes up with Foy (Neil Patrick Harris) the arrogant owner of the local mustache salon. Not far from their town of Old Stump nefarious outlaw Clinch Leatherwood (Liam Neeson) and his gang plan a railroad heist and he sends his put-upon wife Anna (Charlize Theron) to hide out in the town until things cool down. After Albert saves Annas life in a hilariously violently over-the-top saloon brawl the two bond over their shared loathing of life on the frontier. See photos 49 Summer Movies on Our Radar Anna acts like Alberts new girlfriend to make Louise jealous but when Albert winds up challenging Foy to a duel sharp-shooting Anna has one week to turn Albert into a master gunfighter. Naturally the two fall for each other leading to problems when Clinch comes to town and Anna must reveal her identity to her craven new boyfriend. If you grade a comedy by how frequently you chuckle then ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" is funny enough with laughs being generated by old-west profanity random cameos and the fact that many of these 19th century characters speak with like you know a contemporary patois. Also read Seth MacFarlane Explains Geek Westerns to The View Too often unfortunately MacFarlane and his co-writers Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild go for bits where the shock value is supposed to equal actual humor. Theres a running gag about Alberts pal Edward (Giovanni Ribisi) whos courting town prostitute Ruth (Sarah Silverman) with the joke being that a) he doesnt mind that she consorts with dozens of other men every day and b) Edward and Ruth arent having sex until marriage because theyre both Christian. Both ideas are potentially hilarious but MacFarlane doesnt build on either one; he just repeats them over and over with escalating detail and attention to bodily fluids. (Speaking of which theres also a moment in which Albert gets sheep urine delivered directly to the face which is not only not all that funny but also an unwelcome flashback to the opening moments of ""Grown Ups 2"" where Adam Sandler gets similarly soiled by a deer.) Also read Charlize Theron in Talks to Star in Produce Indie Movie American Express (Exclusive) MacFarlane is clearly having a ball with the trappings of an old-school Western; cinematographer Michael Barrett fills the screen with big sky and Monument Valley vistas while composer Joel McNeely serves up heaping helpings of Elmer Bernstein realness. (Theres even a shout-out to ""The Terror of Tiny Town"" during Alberts psychedelic spirit journey. Dont ask.) ""Ted"" proved that Seth MacFarlane had more up his sleeve than the ADD humor of ""Family Guy"" but ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" sees him not entirely ready to be outrageous without pandering. If MacFarlane gets the gumption to go weird without stopping to juvenile poop humor -- as opposed to witty clever poop humor which hes certainly capable of -- he may yet become a filmmaker to watch. For now regrettably hes just sheepish. Breaking News To Your Inbox.
