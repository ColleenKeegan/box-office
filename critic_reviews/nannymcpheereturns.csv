Toback director of Fingers The Big BangR The startling thing about James Tobacks documentary The Big Bang is how much fun it is. Toback director of Fingers 1990-05-18 B+ The Big Bang Director James Toback; MPAA Rating R Posted May 18 1990 -- 1200 AM EDT The startling thing about James Tobacks documentary The Big Bang is how much fun it is. Toback director of Fingers Exposed and other luridly pretentious pop-literary melodramas (as well as the likable mainstream comedy The Pick-Up Artist) had a simple idea. He interviewed several dozen people and asked them about everything sex love death God art anxiety the cosmos youth old age. Toback is a terrific interviewer -- he knows how to cajole and badger people sensitively. And he has shaped the responses into the best of all possible bull sessions one thats funny and moving and never bogs down. A few of the interviewees are names (or at least semi-famous) movie producer Don Simpson; basketball star Daryl Dawkins; restaurateur Elaine Kaufman. But most of them are just ordinary (if accomplished) folks who happen to be Tobacks acquaintances. In each case you form strong early impressions of the people being interviewed -- and then watch with surprise and delight as they prove you wrong. A somber middle-aged ex-gangster describes what a brutal character he could be. Then when recalling the young girlfriend to whom he was devoted his tone changes. Murderous jealousy mingles with the most astonishing tenderness; just when you thought you had the guy pegged he eludes you. A sprightly medical student makes a passionate case for religious conservatism -- without it she says there would be nothing holding us back from chaos. Its a wise thought yet perhaps the last one youd expect to hear from someone so vibrant and young. Despite its cosmic pun of a title The Big Bang isnt really about The Meaning of Life. Its more like 25 slices of life; those in the audience are put in the position of privileged eavesdroppers. The movies key revelation is a sly one Toback has dramatized how much the spirituality (and crazy- existential anxiety) we all tend to keep private is in fact part of our common experience. Its there in different ways in a philosopher a boxer a scientist a musician. The chief pleasure of The Big Bang lies in seeing how much you have in common with people so different from yourself. Who would have thought Don Simpson producer of such crass movie packages as Top Gun and Beverly Hills Cop II could come off as a soulful humanist? Its not that Simpson isnt a canny blowhard -- its that he lets you see the desperation that drives him onward. Toback has always taken a ribbing in the press both for his macho- meshuggener mov-ies and (more recently) for his compulsive womanizing. Now he seems to be trying to reveal a new modest side. The Big Bang sometimes gets bogged down in psychobabble but its a refreshing change of pace both from Tobacks other movies and from the lockstep commercialism of todays Hollywood. It deserves to be seen and savored.

Antonio Banderas starrer ""The Big Bang"" is a borderline unintelligible scattershot attempt at Lynchian neo-noir that takes intellectual and aesthetic risks it has no reasonable hope of pulling off. And yet train wreck that it may be its completely watchable at times garishly eye-catching and certainly the only film in theaters that features Snoop Dogg comparing himself to Alfred Hitchcock. Clearly counting on its star (and some considerable cameos) to goose audience interest ""Bang"" looks most likely to whimper in and out of limited release. The film is doubtless an unacknowledged reboot of Raymond Chandlers ""Farewell My Lovely"" so it comes by its plot challenges naturally -- Chandler himself was more interested in mood. But while director Tony Krantz maintains the anything-goes storytelling cheeky narration and gritty L.A. locations he makes no attempt at recreating the noir-kings shadowy atmospherics instead lensing the pic with a psychedelic quasi-mystical hue thats both pretty and distracting. The tale told by bloodied temporarily blinded private eye Ned Cruz (Banderas) as hes interrogated by a trio of shady cops (Delroy Lindo Thomas Kretschmann and William Fichtner) concerns a giant Russian boxer (Robert Maillet looking taller and wider than a beer truck) freshly out of the pen who hires Ned to track down a girl whos been writing him in prison. After some needless episodes in strip clubs and porn sets he follows the trail to a stash of missing diamonds hidden somewhere in a company town unaccountably filled with Sikhs in the New Mexico desert. Its there that things get truly weird as Ned is drawn into a romantic triangle involving the missing girl (Sienna Guillory) her reclusive billionaire husband (Sam Elliott donning a horrendous hippie wig) and a synesthetic scientist (Jimmi Simpson). The three are working on an underground particle collider which occasions all sorts of metaphysical musings and most bizarrely leads Ned into a tryst with a waitress-slash-particle physics enthusiast (Autumn Reeser). The conflation of New Age philosophizing detective fiction and goofy erotica bears a touch of Haruki Murakami here but its hard to shake the feeling that these elements have been shoehorned in and mean far less than the filmmakers think they do. Banderas is unmistakably having fun with the role though often at the expense of the film and his heavy Spanish accent makes him an unusual Marlowe. Though its no great loss when his delivery garbles the scripts cringe-inducing tough-guy quips of which Neds description of a midget on fire as a ""white dwarf gone supernova"" reps a high/low point. Production design and lensing are both topnotch even though they call a great deal of attention to themselves and former Smiths guitarist Johnny Marrs score is intrusive.

Nanny McPhee Returns (PG) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Nanny McPhee Returns (PG) The Nanny McPhee movies may be principally for kids but make no mistake about it They are quite literally a parents dream. Liam Daniel/Universal Share Print Save to your profile By Jake Coyle Associated Press8/18/2010 Editor rating 2.5 The Nanny McPhee movies may be principally for kids but make no mistake about it They are quite literally a parents dream. Overwhelmed single parents with unruly kids are rescued by a magical nanny who seemingly appears out of nowhere. And at no cost For some older moviegoers escorting little ones this premise might be impossibly alluring. And they said fans of Avatar were depressed when they left the theater. Nanny McPhee Returns is the sequel to 2005s Nanny McPhee. Both were written by Emma Thompson (who stars as the nanny in question) based on Christianna Brands Nurse Matilda books which were published in the 1960s and 70s. That McPhee owes much to P.L. Travers Mary Poppins is obvious and theres a whiff of familiarity to both Nanny McPhee movies that prevent them from being truly fresh. But theres still a warm British naturalism to Nanny McPhee Returns and an old-fashioned cheerfulness uncommon to most of todays kids movies. In the first installment McPhee a mean-looking witch clad in black came to the aid of a widowed father (Colin Firth). This time around she arrives to help Isabel Green (Maggie Gyllenhaal with British accent in tow) a mother of three and wife to a farmer fighting in World War II. The particular war is never mentioned but WWII is the films clear setting. A young nephew Cyril Gray (Eros Vlahos) and his sister Celia (Rosie Taylor-Ritson) have been sent from their wealthy home in London to their aunts thatched-roofed farm house an appalling development to their refined tastes. Eyeing the muddy farm Cyril promptly declares it the ``land of poo. They immediately clash with Isabels three children Norman (Asa Butterfield) Megsie (Lil Woods) and Vincent (Oscar Steer). Isabel is drowning in the chaos made worse by her ditzy candy shopkeeper (Maggie Smith). McPhee arrives mysteriously introducing herself (``little `c big `P ) as an ``army nanny who has been ``deployed. The government pays her way she informs Isabel though one can bet that free magical nannies would surely be among those to fall victim in Britains current deep budget cuts. Thompsons McPhee is a fairly wonderful creation. With two large moles an overgrown front tooth a monobrow and a protruding bulbous nose she appears a mean crone. But its all merely a facade to a deeply caring shepherd of misbehaving children Shes the fairy godmother of tough love. As the children learn each of her five lessons McPhees deformities disappear. The main source of drama (for McPhee wins the kids over quickly) comes from Isabels brother-in-law Phil (Rhys Ifans). Dressed in a shabby blue pinstripe suit he looks like an outcast from Guys and Dolls. He has gambled the farm away even though its only half his. Capably directed by Susanna White (making her feature film debut after some notable TV work) Nanny McPhee Returns is slightly less scatterbrained than the original but keeps its Day-Glo Victorian palette full of color and whimsy. The predictable story turns (the father away at war is handled as youd expect with worry followed by a miraculous homecoming) and the infrequently funny dialogue keep the film from quite taking off. But one can quibble only so much with a family-friendly film that so brightly preaches those not-exactly-hip tenets of country living and manners. When McPhee and two of the children make a trip to London (awash in zeppelins and double-decker buses) they meet a former pupil of McPhees now a Royal guard soldier. Its clear that the country itself has been made from McPhees mettle. Cut government services warily Britain. Cast Emma Thompson Maggie Gyllenhaal Rhys Ifans Maggie Smith. Director Susanna White.

Nanny Emma Thompson returns as magical nanny BY CHARLES WILLIAMS  cwilliamspost-dispatch.com  314-340-8286 Aug 20 2010 (...) Emma Thompson stars as Nanny McPhee in Universal Pictures ""Nanny McPhee Returns."" In ""Nanny McPhee Returns"" Isabel Green (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a young mother coping with a husband at war and a farm in disrepair. When her bratty niece and nephew arrive from London a full-blown fracas ensues.Amid the chaos the mysterious Nanny McPhee (Emma Thompson) appears and her calm demeanor and deft magic quickly quell the mayhem. McPhee is no perky put-together Mary Poppins. She sports a unibrow a buck tooth and several unfortunate moles. But as the children grow to love her McPhees inner beauty shines through.The film is set in the beautiful English countryside and includes some Rube Goldberg-like gadgetry making it reminiscent of bygone films such as ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang."" Weighty issues such as war and divorce are mentioned but the serious themes pass quickly. The lighthearted story always takes precedent over the special effects but a scene involving swimming piglets will have kids flashing a sea of smiles.In reprising the role of Nanny McPhee Thompson has created an enduring character that wins over the hearts of viewers. If you are a fan of the first film you wont be disappointed in the second.""Nanny McPhee Returns"" is a delightful family movie filled with frolicking farm animals flying motorcycles and life lessons worth remembering.

He is having a good 2010 too appearing in the fall release of ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" archly narrating the Banksy film ""Exit Through the Gift Shop"" and especially playing Ben Stillers best friend in ""Greenberg.""

But once shes arrived Nanny McPhee discovers that Mrs. Greens children are fighting a war of their own against two spoiled city cousins who have just moved in and refuse to leave. Starring Ralph Fiennes Maggie Gyllenhaal Emma Thompson Maggie Smith Rhys Ifans Asa Butterfield Daniel Mays Bill Bailey Nonso Anozie Sam Kelly Director Susanna White Running time 140 Release Opened Aug 20 2010  Editorial Review She hasnt lost her touchBy Stephanie MerryFriday August 20 2010It can take a miracle to create a movie thats fun for kids and their parents. Luckily Nanny McPhee has a little magic up her sleeve. It may not have the grown-up appeal of a Pixar creation but theres plenty in ""Nanny McPhee Returns"" to keep everyone entertained for the surprisingly fleeting 108 minutes. Emma Thompson reprises her 2005 role as the title character a strict old bag who looks more Roald Dahl than Mary Poppins. Her appearance is startling Along with some spectacularly hairy moles Nanny McPhee touts a bulbous nose a unibrow and one colossal front tooth. But her physical disarray is balanced by her supernatural ability to clean up a chaotic scene. Oscar nominee Maggie Gyllenhaal whose attempt at a British accent was grating at first as Isabel Green a flighty mother of three ended up a worthy addition to the cast thanks to her winning performance as a quirky loving mother who tries to protect her children from the horrors of World War II. Isabel is trying to make ends meet in the English countryside while her husband fights in the war. To complicate matters her scheming brother-in-law wants her to sell her half of the family farm so he can pay off gambling debts and her hoity-toity niece and nephew are visiting from London. As expected the Green children are at odds with their spoiled big-city counterparts. Londoner Cyril (Eros Vlahos) provides the comedy as a haughty little man stuck in a childs body donning silk pajamas reading the newspaper and introducing himself smugly as from ""the land of soap and indoor plumbing."" Meanwhile his sisters first encounter with her less sophisticated cousins leads her to gasp ""Savages"" Nanny McPhees introduction to the kids may prove slightly disturbing for some. It turns out the woman is adept at the old ""Why are you hitting yourself?"" game popular with brothers the world over. One slam of her cane and the kids are suddenly pulling at their own hair throwing their bodies onto the ground and generally abusing themselves instead of each other. There are other heavier moments too but for every grim discussion theres a lighthearted scene such as one crowd-pleaser involving piglets doing a synchronized swimming routine. Let it be said though that most of the humor is decidedly scatological and since the movie takes place on a farm there seems to be endless fodder for this kind of comedy. But theres a payoff to getting kids interested via gassy cows and burping birds Nanny dishes out five solid lessons parents will probably appreciate from helping each other to learning to share. Things end with a predictably tidy conclusion. But would the persnickety Nanny McPhee have it any other way?Contains rude humor language and mild thematic elements.

Pigs fly and perform a Busby Berkeley-style water ballet. Maggie Gyllenhaal sports a posh British accent. Everybody steps in dung repeatedly. These are the high points of ""Nanny McPhee Returns"" an overlong and overproduced sequel to the dimly recalled 2005 family flick written by and starring Emma Thompson as the poor kids Mary Poppins a snaggle-toothed magical nursemaid with hairy moles. That one was set in Victorian London but this time McPhee lands in the midst of the English countryside during World War II -- which I think is going to require a serious premovie parental tutorial for most contemporary American children. Otherwise the dear little ones may be a trifle confused about just why very spoiled and obnoxious London kids Cyril (Eros Vlahos) and Celia (Rosie Taylor-Ritson) have been sent to live on a farm against their wills. Its owned by an aunt theyve never met -- Mrs. Green who can barely cope with her own rambunctious brood Norman (Asa Butterfield) Megsie (Lil Woods) and Vincent (Oscar Steer). Mrs. Greens husband played by the briefly seen Ewan McGregor is off fighting the war. The government asserts McPhee has sent her (and her flatulent crow) to stop the kids from battling among themselves and to teach them various life lessons. Theres a charming little film struggling to get out of this nearly two-hour CGI extravaganza which includes star turns by Maggie Smith as a dotty old lady and Ralph Fiennes as the London kids forbidding father. Rhys Ifans is far funnier as the comic villain being blackmailed by a pair of wacky sisters though I wonder if the kids will find him forging a death-notification telegram to persuade Mrs. Green to sell the farm all that amusing. I kept hoping a Nazi would drop into the action -- and one does sort of. By the way if you take the kids to see ""Nanny McPhee Returns"" you should also be prepared to explain whether explosive devices can be defused using cuticle scissors.

Credit Liam Daniel/Universal Pictures Emma Thompson is back warts snaggletooth and all to teach unruly children lessons in self-reliance and to remind parents that theyre basically useless if sometimes amusing appendages in ""Nanny McPhee Returns.""The film was released in Britain in March under the title ""Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang"" which was a reference not to the origins of the universe but to a late plot twist involving some unexploded ordnance and the pyrotechnic harvesting of a field of barley. Ms. Thompson writer of both ""Nanny McPhee"" (2005) and this sequel has jumped ahead from the vaguely Victorian setting of the original (which matched the Christianna Brand childrens books on which the McPhee character is based) to a bucolic World War II home front in which the Blitz looks like a particularly strenuous summer on the farm.Under the direction of Susanna White a television veteran (""Generation Kill"" ""Bleak House"") making her feature debut ""Nanny McPhee Returns"" forsakes the menacing air and psychedelic color scheme of the original for a broader comic tone and a sunny gold-flecked palette. Neither the dangers of the plot -- a dissolute uncle who wants to sell the farm a father missing in action -- nor the forbidding Nanny McPhee herself are as fearsome as they were the first time around.In place of menace ""Return"" offers dung the films most consistent motif is the danger of stepping in sitting on or being splattered by it. This may please the younger members of the audience though at a preview screening they were noticeably quiet perhaps bewildered by the British accents and the frequent references to the War Office. (One incisive 5- or 6-year-old critic did pipe up during the closing credits asking ""Why wasnt it in 3-D?"")The hapless parent in need of the nannys help a widower played by Colin Firth in the original is now a war wife struggling to keep the farm going and is played by the American actress Maggie Gyllenhaal. Ms. Gyllenhaal works very hard to meet the scripts alternating demands for melancholy and manic cheerfulness while keeping a credible British accent in place. She does better than you might expect mainly by doing a close imitation of the young Emma Thompson. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Thompson herself who made a vivid even unsettling impression in ""Nanny McPhee"" is relatively innocuous this time around like a walk-on in her own film. With the formula established -- as she cajoles the children into learning her lessons her blemishes disappear one by one until Ms. Thompson looks like her radiantly attractive self -- theres apparently nothing new to know about the nanny.Several distinguished British actors including Ralph Fiennes and an amusingly dotty Maggie Smith lend panache to the credits. But the real scene stealers in ""Nanny McPhee Returns"" are the child actors particularly Asa Butterfield as the farm boy with a chip on his shoulder and Eros Vlahos and Rosie Taylor-Ritson as his supercilious city cousins. The skill and unaffected realism of their performances make you wish that casting on the Harry Potter movies could have been delayed for a few years.""Nanny McPhee Returns"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Cow dung is slung and often spoken about.NANNY MCPHEE RETURNSOpens on Friday nationwide.

Daily Edition Login to download Nanny McPhee Returns -- Film Review 1003 PM PDT 10/14/2010 by Kirk Honeycutt  AP FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS ""Nanny McPhee Returns"" Empty TWITTER Empty Five years after her movie debut -- not so long a passage to have been forgotten and enough time to be fondly remembered -- ""Nanny McPhee Returns."" This marks a welcome reappearance for children and a fanciful wish fulfillment for harried parents who can only yearn for such a child minder. Universal is therefore in a position to enjoy the happy (boxoffice) returns.Nanny McPhee a thoroughly English character pretty much created and enacted by the multitalented Emma Thompson can be summed up as Mary Poppins without the Sherman Brothers delightful songs. But this doesnt quite catch what is unique here. Thompsons nanny with magical powers that make children behave contains certain elements that would be quite at home in a horror film.Her initial appearance in this film for instance is presaged by storm warnings and ominous signs and her entrance is enough to send children scampering under beds. Moles and facial hairs dominate her countenance and considerable body padding gives the actress substantial girth. Clearly no spoonful of sugar is going to help any of Nanny McPhees medicine go down.Like Mary Poppins this character recruited and renamed from three ""Nurse Matilda"" books by Christianna Brand dwells in a bygone England that looked sort of Victorian in the previous film but in this one takes place during a war that only can logically be World War I.The movies farm-family dad (Ewan McGregor in a cameo) is away fighting in the war. This leaves his beleaguered wife Isabel (Maggie Gyllenhaal with a serviceable English accent and a welcome touch of glamour) saddled with a debt-ridden farm and three quarreling children -- a burden greatly increased when two snobbish city cousins arrive for an extended visit. Meanwhile her nefarious brother-in-law Phil (Rhys Ifans savagely overacting) is bugging her to sell the farm so he can satisfy his gambling debts.Enter Nanny McPhee -- ""small c big P"" she reminds everyone -- whose origins are vague to say the least. She claims she is deployed by the British Army. Indeed during a sequence in a nicely period London circa 1915 everyone from military guards to the statues in Trafalgar Square seems to know her. One wonders why her superhero skills arent deployed in the war effort rather than in calming domestic turmoil but then only an adult would question such a thing.It takes but a thump of her crooked cane on the floor to tame five squabbling children through magical ""lessons."" At first this amounts to using her magic against the children but soon they are all so delighted by such things as a baby elephant who sleeps in their beds and squealing piglets capable of synchronized swimming that the youngsters begin to share and cooperate without the need for magical nudges.Thompson admits she looted all three Brand novels for her first ""Nanny"" screenplay so in this one she must start from scratch with only a character and a situation of dire domestic turmoil. The major disappointment here is that the final act relies far too heavily on CGI magic rather than story character or wit. But getting to the final act provides most of the fun.The young actors are adept in their roles especially Eros Vlahos and Rosie Taylor-Ritson as visiting cousins. Their thorough distaste for the aggressively rural environment is palpable and their gradual acclimation to these surroundings is always amusing.Vlahos and Asa Butterfield as Isabels eldest boy have the movies most effective scene in which they confront Ralph Fiennes playing Vlahos stiff military dad during the boys quick trip to London to learn the fate of Butterfields father.Thompson develops some of the smaller roles quite well especially Sinead Matthews and Kathy Brand as a pair of ""hit women"" out to collect on Phils tardy IOUs and Bill Bailey as an affable neighboring farmer.Other roles call for too much mugging. This would include Maggie Smiths turn as a forgetful old shopkeeper and Sam Kelly as an aging air-raid warden. The film suffers slightly from a curious sort of ageism where the older you get the more ""comic"" you become.In the title role Thompson wisely lets her makeup artist do much of the initial work -- the moles and hair do start to disappear as the children learn her lessons leaving her more or less recognizable by movies end. Meanwhile she uses her commanding voice to bring the movies energy to her character while standing aside to give the child protagonists plenty of room to romp.Period films often get coy about their looks through overemphasizing historic details or restricting color palettes. Under Susanna Whites direction cinematographer Mike Eley shoots 1915 as if it were 2010 with bright colors and straightforward framing.Simon Elliotts production design and Jacqueline Durrans costumes set the table for much of the comedy -- fine linens getting soiled in a farms ""land of poo"" -- while never calling undue attention to themselves. James Newton Howards music picks up its comic cues perhaps a bit too swiftly and loudly but little of this detracts from the movies many pleasures.Opens Friday Aug. 20 (Universal)Production Working Title/StudioCanal/Relativity MediaCast Emma Thompson Maggie Gyllenhaal Rhys Ifans Maggie Smith Ewan McGregor Ralph Fiennes Asa Butterfield Lil Wood Oscar Steer Rosie Taylor-Bitson Eros VlahosDirector Susanna WhiteScreenwriter Emma ThompsonBased on a character by Christianna BrandProducers Lindsay Doran Tim Bevan Eric FellnerExecutive producers Debra Osborne Liza Chasin Emma ThompsonDirector of photography Mike EleyProduction designer Simon ElliottMusic James Newton HowardCostume designer Jacqueline DurranEditor Sim Evan-JonesRated PG 108 minutes FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Kirk Honeycutt THRnewsthr.com thr AP THRnewsthr.com thr Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""http//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> comments powered by Disqus The Hollywood Reporter (c) 2016 The Hollywood Reporter All rights reserved.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Aug. 20 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Nanny McPhee Returns Directed by Susannah White Written by Emma Thompson Starring Emma Thompson and Maggie Gyllenhaal With her fuzzy unibrow snaggletooth and hairy chin wart Nanny McPhee looks like a candidate for a reality makeover show. Her homeliness is obviously dear to Emma Thompson who both plays the character and wrote the script for Nanny McPhee Returns and its hit 2005 predecessor. In a world of shiny 3-D plastic stars Nanny McPhee (based on Christianna Brands Nurse Matilda books) stands out as a resolute non-conformist. You have to admire her pluck if not her tweezing. Set in the English countryside during the Second World War the new movie introduces harried mom Isabel Green (American Maggie Gyllenhaal sounding persuasively English) as the mother of three lovely but unruly children oldest boy Norman (Asa Butterfield) middle child Megsie (Lil Woods) and little Vincent (Oscar Steer). Shes trying to maintain a dilapidated farm and keep it from the predations of their dissolute uncle Phil (Rhys Ifans). The children are soon joined by her sisters two pampered city brats - Cyril (Eros Vlahos) and Celia (Rosie Taylor-Ritson) - sent from London to avoid the Blitz. The city kids are disgusted by the country squalor and prevalence of barnyard poo. When the cousins squabbling threatens to turn the household to chaos one night the magical Nanny McPhee mysteriously arrives at the door claiming shes been ""deployed"" by the government. She carries a big black stick and has unenlightened if effective methods that establish respectful order. (Theres something of Margaret Thatcher in her obedience-training methods.) The movie progresses through Isabels continued attempts to save the family farm while Nanny McPhee guides the children through a series of life lessons (""how to share"" how to help"" ""how to be brave"") to prepare them to be a better family. Following the template of the original film the production team has found various opportunities to include CGI animals doing unlikely stunts. A synchronized swimming team of piglets is the highlight. Least convincing is a somewhat unfinished-looking baby elephant who wanders into the farmhouse. As is par for the course with British films acting comes first with entertaining performance from Ifans as the conniving Uncle Phil and Maggie Smith making big messes as a dotty shopkeeper. Ralph Fiennes also pops up briefly as the cold-fish father of the city cousins. Among the children Vlahos who plays the foppish Cyril is the standout with the comic timing of a pint-sized Stephen Fry. Ultimately the performances carry the film. Thompsons script is fast-paced but depends on a series of contrived emergencies culminating in a dilemma with an unexploded bomb (the movies English title for the movie is Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang). Susannah Whites choppy direction (she previously did television adaptations of Bleak House and Jane Eyre) doesnt help nor do the swells of music from James Newton Howards score which are over-emphatic in punching home the emotional moments. The no-nonsense bottom line? Kids should revel in the warts choreographed pigs and animal poo. Their parents will endure these things stoically and occasionally chuckle which seems the traditional English thing to do.

Isabel cant keep her fractious trio from fighting and problems escalate when her brother (Ralph Fiennes) an aloof aristocrat and military leader adds his two spoiled kids to the mix forcing them to adapt from their posh parties to farm life with the pigs and the muck. Movie Information Nanny McPhee ReturnsRatingShowtimes | Official siteDirector Susanna WhiteStarring Emma Thompson Maggie Gyllenhaal Maggie Smith Rhys Ifans Asa Butterfield and Ralph FiennesRun time 109 minutesMPAA rating PG (rude humor some language and mild thematic elements)Synopsis Emma Thompson is back as the nanny everyone needs. She helps Maggie Gyllenhaal get her house in order.More movies from GuideLive.comIsabels on the verge of losing the farm too because her husbands irresponsible brother Phil (Rhys Ifans) is trying to trick her into selling it so he can get his hands on the proceeds to pay off his gambling debts.So Nanny arrives a startling figure in black looking lumpy and disfigured with a twisted wooden cane that shoots sparks and does magic when she pounds it on the floor.Fans of the first film know the drill. Nanny is the childrens Dorian Gray - her physical imperfections reflect the faults of the children she tends. Each time they learn a lesson - to cooperate to have courage to have faith - a mole disappears a tooth stops protruding until by the end she looks as lovely as well Emma Thompson.Thompson who earned Oscars both for best actress (Howards End) and best screenplay adaptation (Sense and Sensibility) brings intelligence heart and humor to the project. But other than brief pointed references to the troubled marriage of the visiting cousins parents the challenges dont seem so great. Phils nefarious plots and the farcical misunderstandings that ensue fuel much of the tensions here rather than painful life passages Thompson explored earlier with the loss of a beloved wife and mother and the struggle of father and children to reopen bruised hearts to the possibility of someone new.Still the lessons Nanny teaches this appealing cast of kids are good ones. The cast sparkles throughout with lovely turns by Fiennes as the difficult dad with all that inner torment he does so well and Sinead Matthews and Katy Brand a hoot as Miss Topsey and Miss Turvey the smiling scary women who have come to collect on Phils debt by stuffing him taxidermist-style. And not to give it away theres more to Maggie Smiths dotty Mrs. Docherty the woman who runs Isabels store than meets the eye. (Of course with Maggie Smith there usually is).Besides even if you werent planning to see another Nanny McPhee film until pigs fly guess what?

Starring Emma Thompson Maggie Gyllenhaal and Maggie Smith. Directed by Susanna White. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The new ""Nanny McPhee"" movie ""Nanny McPhee Returns"" has a lighter spirit than its predecessor but it arrives at the same warm and touching place. Emma Thompson not only stars as the homely supernatural nanny but she also wrote the screenplay as she did last time. So this is turning into quite a sideline Thompson has now made two superior childrens films that in look and spirit are completely their own thing outside the childrens-film trends of the past decade. ""Nanny McPhee"" takes place in a storybook England in a countryside of rolling hills green fields and farm animals. It takes place as well at a storybook period which once upon a time was invariably the Victorian age but now with the passage of years has become World War II. This is the Britain that Americans in particular marvel at and feel in awe of this nation of people who stammer and say ""Excuse me"" but must be tougher than we are because they beat back Hitler. In London the blitz is on but in the countryside the only warring parties are the three children belonging to Isabel (Maggie Gyllenhaal) whose husband is away fighting. She has already lost control of the household when yet two more children arrive her niece and nephew from London whose mother sent them away so they could avoid the bombs. The city kids are rich spoiled and wonderfully obnoxious especially young Cyril who is played by Eros Vlahos a kid with a wonderful face. Pudgy witty and scowling he already looks like Samuel Johnson or Charles Laughton and will probably look exactly the same when hes 60. It is the nature of all ""Nanny McPhee"" stories that there must be bratty kids; otherwise Nanny McPhee would never appear. But these films at least have a healthy recognition that bratty behavior exists and that its not precocious or charming and its not to be excused. Perhaps this quality most of all makes ""Nanny McPhee Returns"" for all its special effects feel old-fashioned in the most refreshing way. The movies one other concession to modernity besides the computer graphics is the relentless poo-poo and flatulence jokes that have been inserted ostensibly to make 11-year-olds scream with delight. Maggie Smith - that is Dame Maggie Smith - playing a demented shopkeeper plops down on a wet cow patty and announces that her seat is quite comfy. At another point the movie leaves you with the impression that Nanny has apologized for flatulence. In retrospect its actually remarkable that Julie Andrews got through all 139 minutes of ""Mary Poppins"" without ever passing wind. In any case Nanny shows up at Isabels door at a point of maximum chaos looking spectacularly ugly Two huge moles (she really ought to have them looked at) a long snaggle tooth and frizzy hair. With her long magic staff she takes charge immediately and the next morning she tells the children ""When you need me but dont want me Ill stay. When you want me but no longer need me Ill go."" Its a cryptic remark which Thompson enunciates with a full appreciation of the characters supernatural eternal quality. Nanny knows ultimate truths that she cannot reveal things that from Thompsons serious demeanor we might infer are not entirely consoling. The universal order may be ultimately benevolent but Thompson suggests that its also exacting. Ralph Fiennes shows up for a strong scene in which he meets up with his son and wants to say that he loves him. And so he does like a true Englishman of his generation ""Done you good that country air. Carry on."" In a much different way Gyllenhaal brings a fullness of heart to the proceedings that contributes much to the movies emotional punch. The original ""Nanny McPhee"" may have been a slightly better movie in most of its particulars but the sequel can put tears in your eyes and thats no small thing. It might be the ultimate measure.

ABOUT THE FILM Nanny McPhee Returns   1/2 out of four StarsEmma Thompson Maggie Gyllenhaal Rhys Ifans Maggie SmithDirector Susanna White|Distributor Universal PicturesRating PG for rude humor and some languageRunning time 1 hour 49 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Nanny McPhee is no Mary Poppins. With her jutting snaggletooth hairy warts and scraggly unibrow she makes a disturbing first impression. In fact she tends to scare small children. But magic lurks behind those off-putting features. The wisdom she imparts is more essential than mere spoonfuls of sugar taking the edge off medicine. She is on hand expressly to help children learn life lessons about kindness helpfulness and bravery. WATCH View the trailer Emma Thompson who wrote and produced Nanny McPhee Returns is ideal as the mysterious nanny dispatched by the military on urgent child-rearing missions. This sequel to 2006s Nanny McPhee is almost as charming as the first. There are problems though in its tone segueing awkwardly from escapism to gritty reality. Some of that is mitigated by the endearing performances and the way the story imbues its young characters with intelligence motivation and depth qualities often lacking for children in family films. Though the first movie took place in vague storybook time this one is firmly rooted in place and era. The tale is set in rural England during World War II and Maggie Gyllenhaal plays Mrs. Green a sweet-natured but frazzled mother of three children whose husband is off at war. They live in a ramshackle but charmingly picturesque farm which they are in danger of losing thanks to the nefarious actions of Mrs. Greens brother-in-law (Rhys Ifans) an inveterate gambler and neer-do-well. Between managing her job at a local shop overseen by the daffy Mrs. Docherty (Maggie Smith) and coping with her boisterous brood -- which includes a pair of snooty spoiled young cousins freshly arrived from London -- Mrs. Green is overwhelmed. Thats where the good nanny comes in. Dressed in strict black Victorian garb her bristly hair tethered in a bun Nanny simply appears and sets about putting the household in order. Ifans shows a clownishly evil side not previously tapped in films though his horribly selfish actions are glossed over. Smith is engagingly scatterbrained and Gyllenhaal is radiant. But its Thompsons film. As Nanny she restores order and happiness with her special subtle brand of magic. The production design amid a bucolic countryside is lovely. But the tone is inconsistent. Sometimes its enchantingly silly Pigs soar above the trees and engage in synchronized swimming stone statues come to life and a baby elephant becomes a slumber party participant. Other times it panders to a young audience with a succession of animal poop jokes. The bathroom humor seems gratuitous undercutting the sweet wit. Plus its both disconcerting and amusing to see the dignified Smith lower her venerable form to plop on a cowpat. Then it suddenly goes dark with the grim repercussions of world war looming large. The lively rumpus and magical goings-on are its strong suit along with the emphasis on children being responsible and strong. But director Susanna White should have picked a direction and more or less stayed with it. The end result while entertaining is the kind of unruly mess you cant imagine the indomitable Nanny McPhee tolerating.

"Movie review Nanny McPhee Returns - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMovie review Nanny McPhee ReturnsEmma Thompson is back as the wonder worker this time teaching manners to some warring cousins.August 20 2010|By Glenn Whipp Special to the Los Angeles Times When Emma Thompson donned a bulbous nose and a protruding snaggletooth to play the title character in 2005s charming family fantasy ""Nanny McPhee"" she was seen as playing a kind of anti-Mary Poppins using a magical walking stick instead of a spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go down. Watching Thompson settle again into the taciturn character in ""Nanny McPhee Returns"" its clear the actress absolutely loves channeling her inner Shane playing a calm authoritative enforcer who arrives unbidden to clean up a mess and then rides off into the sunset when her work is done. The new ""McPhee"" directed by Susanna White tells a slightly different story but uses the same blend of broad comedy respectful moralizing and special effects that made the first film a success. Thompson again wrote the screenplay putting an emphasis on language emotion and manners qualities typically in short supply in movies geared toward families. Where the first film pitted children against adults the follow-up finds Nanny McPhee mediating a conflict between two sets of children. Thompson has moved the action forward a century to 1940s England where frazzled Isabel Green ( Maggie Gyllenhaal) copes with tending to her three rambunctious kids and running a muddy farm while her husband ( Ewan McGregor in a brief cameo) is off fighting in the war. The Green children bicker and battle but theyre just warming up for the arrival of their prissy London cousins Cyril (Eros Vlahos) and Celia (Rosie Taylor-Ritson) neither of whom is happy to be away from their city digs. ""We come from the land of soap and indoor toilets"" Cyril announces surveying the muck surrounding him. Cyrils fighting words lead to much destruction of bric-a-brac and threaten to impinge on Gyllenhaals luminous glow. (The actress who affects a nice Thompson-like British accent has never looked more beautiful.) Enter Ms. McPhee who proceeds to lay down her five laws of cooperation which revolve around sharing and caring and tidying up. Basic stuff though often easier said than done. (Are those magical walking sticks for sale anywhere?) Grown-ups in the audience will enjoy seeing well-chosen vets like Maggie Smith and Ralph Fiennes turn up in key roles not to mention piglets performing some CGI synchronized swimming a la Busby Berkeley. The animals are impossibly adorable but never threaten to upset the films delicate balance between magic and a more sobering reality. Its a fairy tale in the best tradition. calendarlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESMovie review Salmon Fishing in the YemenMarch 9 2012Movie review BeginnersJune 3 2011Far Far AwayMay 10 2002Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-nanny-mcphee-20100820,0,7584997.story",200,nannymcpheereturns16,nannymcpheereturns,latimes

Samuel Goldwyn Films By Joe Morgenstern Updated Aug. 20 2010 1201 a.m. ET Sometimes its best to go into a movie knowing nothing of its plot. At other times an awareness of whats to come enhances the pleasure of watching the story unfold. ""Maos Last Dancer"" a flawed but pleasurable film directed by Bruce Beresford is one of those other times. The story based on the popular autobiography of the same name starts unfolding in earnest during an early scene in a rural grammar school. The time is 1972 and the place is a commune in an impoverished province of Communist China. Government talent scouts have come looking for culture fodder--future stars of Chairman Maos all-consuming cultural revolution. Just as theyre ready to leave without a candidate the teacher asks ""What about that boy?"" and the camera turns to a child whose beautiful face is frozen by fear. At that point its thrilling to know whats to come--that the boy Li Cunxin will grow up to be a ballet dancer of rare accomplishment that he will visit the U.S. where his defection will become a cause celebre and that his artistry--both as a dancer and as a teller of his remarkable tale--will become known throughout the world. (Hes now a stockbroker in Australia; talk about a long and winding road.) Kyle MacLachlan plays Cunxin Lis attorney in ""Maos Last Dancer"" based on Lis autobiography. Video courtesy Samuel Goldwyn Films. Li is played as an adult by Chi Cao a crucial piece of casting that explains more than anything else why the movie works as well as it does. The Chinese-born Mr. Chi is principal dancer with the Birmingham Royal Ballet and its a treat to watch him in action. (The treat de la treat is an extended excerpt from Graeme Murphys choreography of ""The Rite of Spring."") At the same time hes a refreshingly understated and consistently affecting actor. How to explain this is much harder since he has not acted in a movie until now. The answer must lie in the collaboration between the star and his director Mr. Beresford whose gift for working with actors--not all directors have it--has long been on display in such films as ""Tender Mercies"" and ""Driving Miss Daisy."" Bruce Greenwood a fine actor with more credits than you can count on the fingers of twenty hands plays Ben Stevenson the British-born director of the Houston Ballet who first brought Li Cunxin to the U.S. as an exchange student. Its a performance marked by graceful mannerisms yet never for a moment mannered. Kyle MacLachlan is the immigration attorney Charles Foster; he interceded on Mr. Chis behalf when officials at the Chinese consulate in Houston tried to kidnap the dancer following his twin announcements that hed secretly married an American and that he wanted to remain in the U.S. As the young bride Elizabeth Mackey Amanda Schull does well enough with what shes given but her role is truncated--the marriage didnt last--and clumsily managed. Jan Sardis screenplay is the productions Achilles tendon; it gets grievously strained from time to time. Mr. Sardi faced a formidable challenge in adapting and condensing an autobiography that traces its subjects journey from childhood to maturity through two vastly different cultures over the course of several decades. And one form or another of the scripts mosaic structure--back and forth between past and present between China and Houston--was probably unavoidable. But some of its lapses are regrettable a cliche-ridden account of Lis introduction to American life complete with throbbing disco and loud-mouthed Texans; a penchant for intrusive flashbacks (the worst offender involves an ancient archer); a wedding that unaccountably happens offstage and then soon afterward a spasm of domestic discord between Li and Elizabeth that leaves you desperately yearning for less. For the most part though ""Maos Last Dancer"" parallels the success of its hero who discovered that he loved the art form hed been forced to embrace and struggled to make himself physically strong so that in his words he could fly. The movies strengths are considerable. The first section summons up a tormented period of Chinese history when art was bent to the breaking point in the service of a ruthless state. An evocation of Maoist choreography with dancers carrying guns is all the wittier for being played relatively straight. In a brief but stirring vignette the young Li is overwhelmed by the beauty of Baryshnikovs dancing on a smuggled videotape. The film celebrates artistic freedom without preaching a sermon and often flies when Mr. Chi is on screen. When he is on stage spinning and leaping to the strains of magnificent music the film soars. Nanny McPhee Returns ENLARGE Emma Thompson in Nanny McPhee Returns. Universal Pictures The simplest way to explain ""Nanny McPhee Returns"" is that the first iteration released here four years ago didnt cost very much to produce and made a mint so why not do it again. An alternative explanation is that splendid British actors harbor a secret desire to give awful performances. Im not thinking so much about Emma Thompson who plays the title role and wrote both films based on characters created by Christianna Brand. Her performance isnt awful strictly speaking its just a reprise in italics and bolder face of the implacable kiddie wrangler she played before. But Rhys Ifans aims low and hits lower as a smarmy schemer who keeps trying unsuccessfully to out-silly John Cleeses silly walk. And the great Maggie Smith as a dotty old dame named Mrs. Docherty grabs her moment of unglory by sitting on a pad of cowflop that goes squish. Emma Thompson and Maggie Gyllenhaal star in Nanny McPhee Returns a sequel to the 2005 family film Nanny McPhee. Video courtesy of Universal Pictures. This childrens entertainment--grownups beware--is preoccupied by squishy stuff that includes mud and poop as well as by syrup that oozes from cabinet drawers. The plot such as it is centers on Nanny McPhees campaign to civilize two warring factions of ill- behaved children three country kids belonging to a frantic English mother played (with a persuasive English accent) by Maggie Gyllenhaal and two of their condescending city cousins. But the plot is merely a pretext for such specially labored effects as a burping crow and synchro-swimming piglets. The ham-handed director was Susanna White who intercuts compulsively whether or not anything is happening. My favorite character is a gorgeous old Rolls Royce sedan that navigates mud in silence. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD FOCUS Moscow On the Hudson (1984) ENLARGE The end of the Cold War made Paul Mazurskys wonderful film seem dated. Yet Robin Williams as a Russian jazz musician who flies into New York and defects in Bloomingdales gives a performance that remains a modern marvel of comic complexity. (While studying for the role Mr. Williams became sufficiently proficient in his characters native language to convince a number of Russian refugees in the cast that he was one of them.) The script was written by the director and Leon Capetanos. Albert Wolsky designed the costumes and Pato Guzman designed the production which was photographed by Donald McAlpine. The Company (2003) ENLARGE Robert Altmans fictionalized portrait of a dance company (in fact the Joffrey Ballet of Chicago) is all but plotless. The films most dramatic--and genuinely shocking--event is a dancer snapping her Achilles tendon; in a single instant a potentially illustrious career comes to an agonizing end. But Neve Campbell who was trained in classical ballet is a revelation as Ry a featured dancer with the company who must nevertheless work as a waitress to support herself. (Ms. Campbell does Lars Lubovitchs lovely pas de deux ""My Funny Valentine."") Malcolm McDowell is the companys manipulative inspirational director. Gosford Park (2001) ENLARGE In a Robert Altman film thats almost bursting with superb performances Maggie Smith shines as the Countess of Trentham a mistress of acidulous put-downs. Julian Fellowes wrote the screenplay a wickedly astute comedy of manners-cum-murder mystery thats too dense to grasp fully the first time around. How lucky then that its also too much fun to see just once. The ensemble cast includes Eileen Atkins Bob Balaban Alan Bates Charles Dance Stephen Fry Michael Gambon Richard E. Grant Tom Hollander Derek Jacobi Kelly Macdonald Helen Mirren Jeremy Northam Clive Owen Ryan Phillippe Kristin Scott Thomas and Emily Watson.

Joe Neumaier Thursday August 19 2010 423 PM Title Nanny McPhee Returns Childrens stories that present themselves as ""magical"" yet contain little actual magic ought not be giving lessons in how to behave. ""Nanny McPhee Returns"" certainly means well and Emma Thompson has as much fun as the titular taskmaster as she did in the 2005 original but this dour hyperactive family film is joyless overly busy and starchy. Worse it pats itself on the back for doling out the most minimal of morals.Adapted from the ""Nurse Matilda"" books written in the 1960s and early 70s ""Nanny McPhee Returns"" begins in the midst of World War II as the three Green children are facing a crisis on their English farm. When their aristocratic cousins Cyril (Eros Vlahos) and Celia (Rosie Taylor-Ritson) are sent there from London to avoid the bombings the kids initially clash -- much to the dismay of their hardworking mom Isabel (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who has a job cataloguing jam for a doddering shopkeeper (Maggie Smith) while her husband (a briefly seen Ewan McGregor) is serving overseas.The childrens bad behavior forces Nanny McPhee to arrive on a dark and yes stormy night to serve as governess. She arrives with a belching black crow on her shoulder and helps the family clean up and save some pigs and detours Isabels brother-in-law Phil (Rhys Ifans) from selling the farm. Most crucially she teaches the young ones five lessons in good behavior each one a bitter pill that nonetheless shows the benefits of kindnessand cooperation.Though the mysterious McPhee is more Willy Wonka than Mary Poppins this is the kind of childrens lark that forces its whimsy on you; every pratfall or step into cow dung is accompanied by perky musical accompaniment and theres a pair of strange-looking sisters -- Miss Topsy and Miss Turvy -- who want the deed to Isabels land but look as if they fell out of a Tim Burton movie. Ifans meanwhile is too retro-cartoony for 6-to-10-year-old audiences and Gyllenhaal just seems frazzled though her English accent and vintage clothes suit her well.The kids are all right but British TV director Susanna White makes their misbehaviorexasperating instead of awful so when McPhee taps her magical walking stick and makes them hit themselves or whatnot its a bit much. Youngsters may enjoy the clowning around but even they may get annoyed.Thompson who also wrote the script can work wonders with a withering glance and a purposeful pause and is never less than engaging. Nanny McPhee with all the goofily ugly warts and makeup still isnt as cuddly as the movie wants us to believe she is. Nonetheless Thompson is the only spark in sight.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Nanny McPhees second foray onto the big screen is just a bit sweeter then the first. Sweet as in pickles not sugar because this movie isnt afraid of alienating its audience by throwing in a little sour realism amid the magic. Thanks to star Emma Thompsons smart appealing script the mysterious baby sitter with the grotesque face and no-nonsense ways once again delivers a welcome antidote to Disneyfied heroines. This time she descends upon the Green familys muddy chaotic farm barely held together by a harried mom (Maggie Gyllenhaal having the time of her life) raising three quarrelsome kids in the 1940s while her husband is away at war. When two rich haughty cousins arrive via chauffeur a pint-sized class war breaks out until Nanny McPhee -- ""small c big P"" she says chin tucked into her neck -- appears and teaches them five life lessons without them suspecting a thing. Thompson who won an Oscar for her adapted screenplay of Jane Austens ""Sense and Sensibility"" has managed to spin a story that can engage both kindergartners and 9-year-olds. Poo jokes pigs doing water ballet baby elephants in the bedroom and slapstick abound as do great performances. Rhys Ifans is barely recognizable as a double-crossing uncle Maggie Smith is delightful as an eccentric shopkeeper Ralph Fiennes turns in an intense cameo as the cousins distant forbidding father and tween actor Eros Vlahos plays cousin Cyril like a miniature Oscar Wilde. Parents may find themselves checking the time on their cell phones less often than usual. But be warned After seeing ""Nanny McPhee Returns"" your kids may start clamoring for egg-and-cress sandwiches ginger beer drawers filled with treacle and -- of course -- a supernatural nanny who says ""When you need me but dont want me then I must stay. When you want me but dont need me then I must go.""

She speaks softly and carries a very big stick an alpenstock with wandlike magical powers that instills virtue in her wards.Featuring pigs that fly (and synchronize-swim) an unusually graceful elephant and a crow that is Nannys sidekick the film boasts animal magnetism for kids and emotional resonance for adults.Like Toy Story 3 and The Kids Are All Right Nanny M is about one who helps to build the character of children and when done bids them goodbye. ""When you need me and do not want me I will come"" Nanny announces to her charges. ""And when you want me and do not need me I will leave."" (Thompson conceived Nanny as the Shane of the nursery.)The first installment of Nanny M was set in Edwardian England. This time around the mystical time-traveler materializes in rural England during World War II.She comes to the aid of beleaguered mom Isabel Green (Maggie Gyllenhaal with a perfect British accent). Isabels husband is away at war her three children are running riot and her snooty niece and nephew have been dispatched to the farm that her brother-in-law (Rhys Ifans) wants to sell to pay his gambling debts.At its best Nanny McPhee Returns has the playful surrealism of Babe if Babe had been directed by Terry Gilliam. (Maybe its the combination of peripatetic piglets and Thompsons off-center humor.)Its actually directed by Susanna White a British television director (Bleak House) who strikes a nice balance between slapstick and earned sentimentality. The movie warms the heart without using schmaltz to fuel its fire.From grown-ups to rug rats the actors are a joy especially Maggie Smith as a fuddled shopkeeper who would seem to have lost her last marble. (Even those immune to bathroom humor have to chortle at the woman who mistook a cow pie for a cushion.)The screenplays nicest visual touch is that people mirror their context. When the children are brutish and nasty Nanny M is unibrowed and very unattractive. But as the charges master Nannys lessons in self-control and empathy snaggleteeth and warts are replaced by an even bite and clear skin.An eloquent way to illustrate how internal change can improve external looks.Nanny McPhee Returns  (out of four stars)Directed by Susanna White.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Part of what made the first ""Nanny McPhee so infectiously amusing was that it really was the anti-""Mary Poppins peppered with odd subversive moments and full of relentlessly dour looks from Emma Thompsons magical mono-browed mole-dotted caregiver. She might as well have shown up saying ""Im having a bad face day children so spare me the spoonful-of-sugar nonsense -- youll take your medicine and like it.In the disappointing sequel from Thompson and director Susanna White (the BBCs ""Bleak House) we get a gentler more wink-inclined Nanny McPhee not to mention kids whose rambunctiousness seems manufactured rather than entertainingly exaggerated. This time the parent at the end of her tether is Isabel (Maggie Gyllenhaal complete with British accent) whos struggling to keep the family farm afloat while her husband (briefly glimpsed Ewan McGregor) is off fighting in WWII. Isabels three children (Asa Butterfield Lil Woods and Oscar Steer) gamely pitch in with the mucking and pig-tending and for the most part are actually pretty civilized. In the first movie we had widower Colin Firth playing beleaguered as usual like second nature; here Isabel isnt so much a candidate for ""Nanny 911 as for an HGTV rescue.Its a curious premise-thwarting hole for Thompson to dig for herself as the movies writer. But its a hole she clambers out of by introducing the kids snooty citified cousins Cyril and Celia (Eros Vlahos and Rosie Taylor-Ritson) to get the fighting started. With his ""Little Rascals Waldo suits and general air of junior foppishness Vlahos is the movies one scene stealer delivering his share of Thompsons copious kid-catering poo references with perfect disdain. ""Weve come from far away Cyril tells his cousins ""from the land of soap and indoor toilets.The brood is soon being uniquely schooled in all the familiar lessons about getting along sharing and cooperation -- in the last case to wrangle a bunch of runaway piglets that have been magically transformed into oinking acrobatic wonders. (The pigs Busby Berkeley aquatic number in the farms pond easily outshines flat gags like a chronically belching pet crow.) Nanny McPhee also helps the kids help themselves both in keeping the farm from the clutches of a scheming relative (a squandered Rhys Ifans) and in trying to prove that McGregors character is still alive despite a fateful army telegram.The movie neednt be so busy or so sweet. When Nanny McPhees charges need to get to the War Office quick she plops them into her quaint sidecar motorcycle and races off to London. The initial close-up of Thompson -- all sourly snaggletoothed and begoggled -- is as funny as anything in the original. And just that one quick glimpse would have been perfect. But then plot demands and a general push for saccharinity have her taking to the air on the bike and being saluted by the Queens Guard and cheerily rocketing down a country byway. So much for skipping the spoonful of sugar.Tom Russo can be reached at trusso2222gmail.com. (c) Copyright 2010 Globe Newspaper Company. Thought you might like ...

Nanny McPhee Returns Fair to good Director Susanna White. Cast Emma Thompson Maggie Gyllenhaal Rhys Ifans. Rating PG for rude humor language and mild thematic elements. Family fantasy films Spotlight Emma Thompson Emma Thompson returns as well as both title character and screenwriter. She sets the story in a small village in wartime England where Isabel Greene (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is looking after her three children while her husband (Ewan McGregor) is off fighting. ""Coping"" is how she puts it and the gist is just barely. Whats more rich cousins from London are coming to stay for a while ostensibly because the city is being bombed though other reasons are hinted at. Spoiled and snotty upon their arrival at the dirty messy farm the city kids announce ""Were in the land of poo."" Indeed Isabels kids even make snowmen - poomen? - out of it. The place is a mess too much for one parent to handle. Meanwhile Uncle Phil (Rhys Ifans) Isabels brother-in-law wants to sell the farm to pay off gambling debts and Isabels boss Mrs. Docherty (Maggie Smith) is growing increasingly addled. Clearly Isabel needs help on all fronts especially when she starts hearing the familiar phrase ""Nanny McPhee is the person you need"" uttered by for instance tea services. The voices must be right. That night Nanny McPhee hideous looking like a hag with her bulbous nose warts and snaggletooth shows up on Isabels doorstep and announces herself as an Army nurse. ""I have been deployed"" she says and sets about immediately to calm down the kids - again in this film by means of her magical cane or staff or whatever it is which she pounds on the ground. They will have to learn five lessons she explains to Isabel. And she explains to the children her method of working ""When you need me but do not want me then I must stay. When you want me but no longer need me then I have to go."" As in the first movie when a lesson is learned there is a corresponding loss of a wart or unibrow or some other badge of ugliness for Nanny McPhee. The results of her work are predictable yet pleasantly played out whether it be something as silly as CGI-assisted piglets conducting synchronized swimming or the more serious matter of the boys standing up to ice-cold Ralph Fiennes the city kids father who is ""very high"" in the war office. Director Susanna White is somewhat restrained in her use of special effects at least until the last act which involves the defusing of an unexploded bomb that yields unexpected (and somewhat overdone) results. Thompson unrecognizable for most of the movie is impressively dour a sort of Mary Poppins gone to seed. A nice touch is the implication that at one time or another Nanny McPhee has looked after about half the population of London. And why not? Shes good at what she does; likewise so is Thompson.

"Nanny McPhee returns and the result is disappointing - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs 2 starsNanny McPhee returns and the result is disappointingAugust 19 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie critic2 stars ""Nanny McPhee Returns"" plays like a sequel designed to wallop the Americans who arent the primary revenue stream for this franchise and never will be. The first film came out five years ago. It was charming. The return is more pushy than charming which is odd given the pedigree of its key collaborators. Emma Thompson (right) is a wonderful performer and a skillful adapter and the director of the film is Susanna White who did ""Bleak House"" and ""Jane Eyre"" for the BBC. The combo seemed auspicious. That first film which White did not direct balanced comically sinister child-discipline tactics and whimsical romance. The sequel (already out on the DVD shelves in Britain under its original title ""Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang"") was a fine fat hit in the U.K. and it is rife with frantic incident. We are back in rural England. Theres a war on -- World War II based on the clothes and cars and air raid wardens -- and the farm belonging to the beleaguered Green family is teetering on the brink. Dad ( Ewan McGregor) is off fighting and Uncle Phil ( Rhys Ifans exhausting in an unfunny role) wants control of things to settle his gambling debts. No strangers to pig excrement and hard work the three Green children are forced to play host to their snooty London cousins who ""Narnia""-like have been shipped from the city to the farm and who are aghast at the sheer tonnage of poo this farm generates. McPhees supernatural presence causes all sorts of wonders en route to making a squabbling brood peaceable and whole again. Pigs do synchronized swimming routines and dash straight up trees motorcycles fly statues come to life. For all that the most interesting scene in ""Nanny McPhee Returns"" is a five-minute conversation between Ralph Fiennes (as the cousins starchy father a muckety-muck in the War Office) his son (played by Eros Vlahos) and the Green lad Norman (Asa Butterfield). The scene takes its time. Its played for keeps. Its moving. Too much of the contrasting comedy in ""Nanny McPhee Returns"" is shrill laden with routine computer-generated effects and pounded into dust by James Newton Howards shut-up-already musical score. Regarding Maggie Gyllenhaal (second from right at top) who plays Isabel Green A respectable dialect is only half the battle in any portrayal. Shes a vivid and expressive actress yet in or out of a dialect she seems incapable or uninterested in throwing away even the most obvious throwaway lines. I like my throwaway lines thrown away; that way a scenes pace remains dynamic and up-tempo. Thompsons talking about a third ""Nanny McPhee"" for reasons both financial and creative she says. I hope the third has more of the glancing touch of the first than the erratic energy of the second. mjphillips tribune.com MPAA rating PG (for rude humor some language and mild thematic elements) Cast Emma Thompson (Nanny McPhee); Maggie Gyllenhaal (Isabel); Rhys Ifans (Phil); Maggie Smith (Mrs. Docherty); Ewan McGregor (Mr. Green); Ralph Fiennes (Lord Gray) Credits Directed by Susanna White; written by Emma Thompson based on the ""Nurse Matilda"" books by Christianna Brand; produced by Lindsay Doran Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner.

In director Susanna Whites sequel to the 2005 Nanny McPhee the titular ugly nanny (played under unsightly makeup by star/writer Emma Thompson) appears in wartime on the doorstep of Maggie Gyllenhaals harried mother whose efforts to control three unruly kids and their snooty visiting cousins is complicated by her soldier husbands absence as well as by her sniveling brother-in-laws (Rhys Ifans) attempts to make her sell the poo-covered family farm. Imparting life lessons with a bang from her magic cane Thompsons intimidating caregiver is a charmless snooze. As the childrens bad habits disappear so too do McPhees hairy moles and snaggletooth and just as every book can be judged by its cover in this English countryside-set fable every source that the film futilely strives to emulate proves transparent. Awash in CG pandemonium involving synchronized-swimming pigs and burping birds McPhees latest saga neither conjures the humanistic heart of Babe nor addresses father-son separation issues with the sobriety of The Water Horse. Instead its merely a compendium of photocopied elements cartoonish special effects and easy-bake happily-ever-afters.

A spoonful of sugar a half-cup of schmaltz and some synchronized-swimming CGI piglets help the moral medicine go down a second time in family-friendly ""Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang."" Noisy as its title might suggest but good muck-splattered fun this sequel follows the same narrative trajectory as its cash-cow predecessor but transplants the title character to WWII-era Blighty to train a whole new family. Brand recognition should help ""Bang"" earn big bucks especially in the U.K. while the lack of 3D may prove as much a help as a hindrance in a market saturated with multidimensional product. Quintessentially middle-class-minded and parent-pleasing the franchise lauds above all good manners and happiness through imposed obedience; in that respect Nanny McPhee is like the Dog Whisperer in a black-crepe frock.  Based on the ""Nurse Matilda"" childrens book series by Christianna Brand the Victorian era-set ""Nanny McPhee"" (2005) revolved around a widowed father (Colin Firth) and his unruly litter of seven whom Nanny McPhee coerced into good behavior via magical means. Rather than catch up with the original characters ""Bang"" airlifts its heroine across decades into a family living in rural England during the Blitz. Once again one parent is absent this time the father Rory (played oh-so-briefly by Ewan McGregor) whos away fighting for his country. Temporarily single mother Isabel Green (Maggie Gyllenhaal essaying a fair Brit accent) has to contend not only with her own bickering brood of three -- 11-year-old Norman (Asa Butterfield) middle child Megsie (Lil Woods) and little Vincent (Oscar Steer) -- but also her sisters two spoiled brats Cyril (Eros Vlahos a standout with knockout comic timing) and Celia (Rosie Taylor-Ritson also excellent) whove come to sit out the war in the supposedly safe countryside. The latter siblings are highly unimpressed with the Greens mud-strewn country digs. Arriving unbidden but explaining shes been sent by the government Nanny McPhee (once again played by Emma Thompson who also scripted both films) enters the fray appearing once again as a snaggle-toothed grizzled crone. But after the children learn each of the five lessons she sets out to teach them (""to stop fighting"" ""to share nicely"" and so on) she loses a disfigurement and emerges youthful and fresh-faced by the end instilling the overall lesson that anyone who is beloved is always beautiful. Clearly loath to mess with a sure thing Thompson and producers Lindsay Doran Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner have stuck closely to the original pics template right down to the inclusion of CGI animals displaying outrageous antics and an ending involving a last flashy trick from the supernanny. Theres a sense that helmer Susanna White -- making her first feature after impressive TV work on ""Generation Kill"" and adaptations of ""Bleak House"" and ""Jane Eyre"" -- hasnt that much room to make her own mark here but she does a capable enough job coaxing good perfs from the child cast and boisterous ones from the grown-ups which serve to highlight Thompsons almost eerie stillness as McPhee. Kids are likely to gorge on it all like chocoholics on Easter Sunday while accompanying adults are less likely to be bored than they would be at most kidpics thanks to amusing turns by Sinead Matthews and Katy Brand as a pair of maniacal hitwomen and Maggie Smith as a doddery old dear first seen cheerfully buried up to her waist in flour recalling Winnie in Samuel Becketts ""Happy Days."" Simon Evan-Jones editing is perhaps a bit too frantic cross-cutting so relentlessly at one point that some setups are estranged from their punchlines. Score by James Newton Howard expresses itself in huge orchestral gestures that almost threaten to overwhelm the mood but it still works. Period design throughout is highly stylized adding a not-unwelcome modern sensibility although the costumes for Gyllenhaals character arguably go a little too far down the contempo road resembling recent retro creations on 21st-century catwalks. Universal is releasing the film Stateside under the title ""Nanny McPhee Returns.""

Down on the farm Maggie Gyllenhaals Mrs Green is at a loss when her three terrors are joined by their posh cousins evacuated from the threat of bombs over Kensington though its not long before ex-military Nanny McPhee instils improving discipline. The mix is similar to the first film naughtiness versus magic but nimbler this time as it shuttles from class warfare to unscrupulous spivs (draft-dodging well-dodgy uncle Rhys Ifans) and the prospect of enemy attack. Its bitty and rather light on mounting excitement yet Thompson the writer smuggles in cheery elements of Enid Blyton and A Little Princess the frolicking Old Spot piglets are a delight and Nannys resourceful jackdaw Edelweiss a cult hero in the making. Director Susanna White surely one to watch manages some disarming emotional grace notes under the circumstances.
