Actor-TV director Tony Bills epic homage to these gung-ho apple-pie boys is reminiscent of Michael Bays Pearl Harbour with its glossy colour palette conventional humdrum narrative and soppy love interest between hunky rookie Blaine Rawlings (James Franco) and sultry French sylph Lucienne (Jennifer Decker). It should by rights have been made into a TV mini-series since few would wish to endure over two hours of this cliched mush in one sitting. The worst offender is Trevor Rabins textbook-trite score the lads get ready for battle (cue swooning strings); a German triplane is shot down (cue militaristic brass); one of their own is killed (cue heavenly choral muzak); a moment of reflection (cue solo trumpet) etc. True the myriad computer-generated dogfights are mostly well choreographed and rendered but when youve seen one youve seen them all. Which leaves one with just the performances to consider. Erm... pass.

As the digital biplanes in Peter Jacksons ""King Kong"" made clear the time was ripe for a grand-scale revival of the World War I aviation movie. Now we have ""Flyboys"" loaded with cliches and digital dogfights more dazzling than anything in ""The Blue Max"" (1966) and ""Von Richthofen and Brown"" (1971). But are these computer-generated Nieuport biplanes and Fokker triplanes really as impressive as the real thing? Not entirely but that doesnt stop ""Flyboys"" from being a perfectly enjoyable slice of B-movie entertainment with A-movie production values. Aviation buffs will relish it flaws and all. Those spiffy effects have an artificial sheen. ""King Kong"" set the bar so high that the 65 million ""Flyboys"" cant match it in terms of digital photorealism although some of the airborne wizardry is still wondrous to behold. More troublesome is a screenplay that dredges up every familiar element of combat movies without a shred of innovation apart from whatever goodwill is engendered by fictionally embellishing a fact-based story set in France in 1916. Movie review Showtimes and trailer""Flyboys"" with James Franco Jean Reno Jennifer Decker Abdul Salis Martin Henderson. Directed by Tony Bill from a screenplay by Phil Sears Blake T. Evans and David S. Ward. 139 minutes. Rated PG-13 for war-action violence and some sexual content. Several theaters. In this case its the tale of the Lafayette Escadrille the French combat unit that pioneered aerial warfare during World War I recruiting American pilots prior to our entry into the war. As a Texan maverick (well played by James Franco) signs up and eventually romances a charming French girl (Jennifer Decker) we take what pleasures we can from male-bonding camaraderie including the first-ever black fighter pilot (Abdul Salis) a veteran bent on revenge (Martin Henderson with charisma to spare) a stern but lovable commander (Jean Reno) and the chivalrous Black Falcon (Gunnar Winbergh) this films answer to Germanys deadly Red Baron. Director Tony Bill brings seasoned experience and affectionate reverence to this noble material but the painstaking authenticity and appealing cast of ""Flyboys"" cant overcome the cloyingly formulaic nature of its story.

Drama. Directed by Tony Bill. (PG-13. 132 mins. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Flyboys"" is Tony Bills shot at a ripping old-school adventure about World War I pilots but besides some fine dogfight sequences it often feels threadbare just an exercise in recycling. Dramas about the early flying aces have a long Hollywood history from ""Wings"" (1927) and ""Hells Angels"" (1930) up to ""The Blue Max"" (1966) ""Von Richthofen and Brown"" (1971) and beyond. The critical response has often been the same great battle sequences but the rest is pretty moldy. That about sums up ""Flyboys."" The film (""based on a true story"") follows the exploits of young Americans who joined the famed Lafayette Escadrille -- a volunteer air squadron -- before the United States entered the war. The theme of course is how these greenhorns become hardened fighters and the tribulations and losses they suffer along the way. While thoroughly old-fashioned in spirit ""Flyboys"" does benefit from new technology. While the filmmakers aimed for total authenticity in production details -- some genuine museum-quality old planes were used along with painstakingly re-constructed ones -- they also made extensive use of computer enhancement. The result is adrenaline-pumping. (The special effects are by Double Negative the firm that did the CGI work for ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire."") Otherwise its a farrago of familiar themes characters and incidents doled out to a swelling musical track There are heroes and cowards; veterans and babes in the woods; an ineffectual rich kid and a Texas cowboy and a young black boxer. Theres a pious fellow who sings ""Onward Christian Soldiers"" as he flies into battle. There are tragedies and pranks. One sequence is set in a bordello and for love interest theres a beautiful French girl who speaks fumbling English. And shes taking care of a few adorable kids. The filmmakers heavy reliance on prefabricated parts makes the movie feel long. It could easily have ended after the epic battle sequence in which the Lafayette fliers pursue a German dirigible thats on a mission to bomb Paris. Its a shame because theres talent involved here both fresh and mature on both sides of the camera. Jack-of-all-trades Bill produced the Oscar-winning ""The Sting"" before he turned to directing (and hes had some decent acting roles). Bill is also an enthusiastic student of World War I aviation. Producer Dean Devlin was a main force behind ""Independence Day."" And one of the writers is ""The Stings"" David S. Ward. Heading the cast are James Franco (""Spider-Man 2"") as the Texan Martin Henderson (""The Ring"") as the senior pilot and the respected veteran Jean Reno (""The Da Vinci Code"") as the squadrons commander. Their efforts are especially impressive given the stale material. Advisory Some bloodshed depicted in the battle sequences.

James Franco plays one of a handful of Americans who fight for the French during WWI in Flyboys. Photo Courtesy Photo Flyboys 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Flyboys is set in the age of silent film and I wish it were one. It almost is already. Its most glorious sequences are its arcing World War I dogfights as whirling and lovely as a cage full of delicate (if angry) butterflies. Watching these aerobatic set pieces I felt a thrill of vintage movie-going joy This is what cinema should do and used to. This is spectacle in the grand old style a bygone shot of adrenaline and grace. As must happen in such films the planes eventually land. Their pilots inevitably speak. When they do Flyboys loses some altitude becoming an earthbound vehicle for fusty plot devices and cornpone dialogue that inspires both under- and overacting. I preferred the overacting; it added to the illusion this was a silent picture complete with tinkling piano and sepia-toned title cards. I even wonder whether director Tony Bill (back from television) instructed some of his actors to overdo it and mug like hell telling them to ""flare your nostrils"" or ""flick your head toward your enemy in disdain"" Flyboys is based on the true story of the 1917 Lafayette Escadrille a French squadron of international fighter pilots -- historys first -- that engaged the Germans in World War I. As the movie explains from the start planes had barely been invented when nations started rigging them with guns. Among those who volunteered to fly were assorted Americans including for Flyboys purposes a doughy heir (Tyler Labine) an African-American boxer (Abdul Salis) a dashing cowpoke (James Franco) and a surly veteran (Martin Henderson) with 20 kills under his belt and counting. He owns a pet lion but who growls loudest? Under orders from their capitaine (Jean Reno who ranks among the underactors) the American flyboys pilot their machines up up and away rattling off bullets in the clouds over verdant French farmland. These scenes are plump with nostalgia not just for the true-blue heroism of an earlier time but also for its wooly trappings stiff uniforms snarling propellers comely maidens carrying bread. One such damsel (Jennifer Decker) befriends Francos character who warms himself at her fireside and rescues her when shes in distress. It goes without saying that the screenplay is cliched; shouldnt it be? Shouldnt Reno tell his fliers ""Remember its the man not the machine that matters""? Shouldnt a pious pink-faced pilot plunge into a dogfight singing Onward Christian Soldiers? The films propellant swagger owes plenty to the dogfights of 1927s Wings and the clench-jawed virility of 1939s Only Angels Have Wings to which Flyboys pays obvious homage in a post-mission bar scene. Franco playing the Jean Arthur part is aghast at the callousness of flyers who should -- he thinks -- be grieving for their lost buddies not drinking like theres no tomorrow. Pilots die every day hes told. Lifes too short to waste on moping. These are tough lessons but familiar ones -- drawn from the sad wisdom of goggled young men in long silk scarves nosing their planes out of a dive. The Doppler-effect whine might recede into silence but the wistfulness never fades. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Augason Farms 1-Year Emergency Food Supply for 796 + pickup...

Well meet the Fokkers. Youll be sorry you did. If the current legroom in economy class doesnt make you resent the birth of the Wright Brothers ""Flyboys"" certainly will. Like a flight from New York to Los Angeles its bad and its long. The forgotten American aviators of The Great War stir from their graves just long enough to prove they still havent bothered to learn any French then go noisily - alas not quickly - into the blue yonder. What is it with those impertinent French people anyway? Must they insist upon using a foreign language? If a handful of spoiled American millionaires and malcontents are willing to ship all the way to Marseilles to put on fancy scarves and fly biplanes shouldnt the locals have the courtesy to learn fluent English? At least the prostitutes? But I digress stunned by the presence of everything from a pet lion to Jean Reno in a Legionnaire uniform in a supposedly gritty tale of wartime drama. It took many wrong twists of the ailerons to arrive at ""Flyboys"" and I shouldnt place all the blame on the Frenchmans galling refusal to speak American. ""Flyboys"" allegedly tells the kind-of-true story of American volunteers who flew fighters for the French before the United States formally entered World War I in 1917. James Franco is Blaine Rawlings the leader of a group of characters painstakingly assembled into composites from a secret Hollywood cliche manual. We get Tex otherwise known as Rawlings who actually says at one point to his French girlfriend ""Yer English is gittin so good"" And Fatty Snobster (Tyler Labine) who is mean to black people. And Noble Black Soldier (Abdul Salis) who will save Fattys cognac during a dogfight and teach him a Valuable Lesson. And Scared Colleague (variously Phillip Winchester David Ellison et al.) whom Tex will take under his wing (sorry) and teach more Valuable Lessons that often involve dying with honor. If you like that character development youll love the script ""Its a beautiful country. I can see why the French fight for it."" And ""Every time I go up Im afraid."" Or ""You can either join in or go up to your room and cry like a little baby."" Wait theres more. ""So youre a prostitute? You dont look like one."" If only I had a franc for every time that line worked in a LoDo bar. ""Ill give you a half-hour to get out of town."" OK thats enough youre already reaching for the air-sickness bag and you havent even met the Black Falcon yet. Word to the wise everybody is afraid of the Black Falcon because hes mean ... and hes German ... and ... his plane has THREE wings. The boys spend more time painting mascots on their biplanes than learning to fight. No matter for the crashes turn lucky too - wouldnt we all like to land the ol Sopwith so to speak in a Provence brothel surrounded by wildflowers? Since ""Flyboys"" has no grounding in reality Ill end with the one valuable lesson it may offer. Should you find yourself crash-landing your biplane into a brothel and you still havent learned any French get yourself a nice leg wound that needs immediate attention. Preferably in the upper thigh.

Comments Flyboys A labor of love for director Tony Bill this World War I drama was inspired by the Lafayette Escadrille a French squadron of flying aces who were mostly American volunteers. The aerial dogfights are thrilling but the script seems to have been written by Snoopy. It follows five new recruits as they earn their wings among them a cocky Texan (James Franco) a troubled rich kid (Tyler Labine) and a black boxer (Abdul Salis) based on real-life aviator Eugene Bullard. The most risible characters are Jean Renos gruff but lovable commanding officer and Martin Hendersons world-weary veteran flier who keeps materializing out of nowhere to deflate the young trainees with some blackly portentous remark.

"Flyboys is saved by high-altitude action - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW High-altitude action saves Flyboys By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  September 22 2006 Remember ``Hells Angels"" the World War I dogfight movie that Howard Hughes was obsessed with in ``The Aviator""? Theyve effectively remade it as ``Flyboys"" a high-altitude epic that repackages every aerial cliche in the playbook for an audience coming to them for the first time.The movies straightforward and ingratiating and as pretty-boy history lessons go its a lot less obnoxious than ``Pearl Harbor."" Still you may wish theyd found some storytelling inspiration to match the onscreen gung-ho.Purporting to tell the true story of the Lafayette Escadrille  the squadron of American volunteers who flew for the French during the early days of WWI (before the United States entered the war) ``Flyboys"" hammers just enough tent pegs into the truth to build a believable encampment. For one thing there actually were two tame lions who served as the squadrons mascots (the film merges them into one) and Eugene Skinner the African-American flier played by Abdul Salis is based on Eugene Bullard historys first black military pilot.Skinner is one of the crowd in ``Flyboys"" and his squadron mates include the films designated hunk Blaine Rawlings (James Franco) a Texas boy looking for action after his farm forecloses; Jensen (Philip Winchester) a kid from a military family who has to come to grips with his fear; Beagle (David Ellison) a daredevil with a shady past; rich snob Briggs Lowry (Tyler Labine); and Higgins (Christien Anholt) whos flying for the Lord. Theyre overseen by Captain Thenault (Jean Reno who else?) and guided by Cassidy (Martin Henderson) a grizzled cynical ace who has parachuted in from an old Howard Hawks movie.``Flyboys"" tells its tale as if proceeding by the Stations of the Flying Cross Theres the training sequence the initial flights the confrontation with a lethal German flier named the Black Falcon (Gunner Winbergh). A certain Corporal Lunchmeat (not his real name) is sacrificed to illustrate the dastardliness of the Hun. Blaine crashes into a provincial bordello and encounters the lovely Lucienne (Jennifer Decker) who -- Dieu merci -- is only dropping off fromage for the hard - working ladies. (Except for Cassidy who has obviously read his Hemingway none of our boys deigns to dally.)All this is old old stuff that has been handsomely filmed with attention to period detail; only the freshly scrubbed modernity of the cast -- the one thing that stands to put the film over with younger audiences -- rings false. The love scenes between Franco and Decker feel like kids playing dress-up; if youre looking for a recent WWI movie that conveys the passions and devastations of the era rent 2004s ``A Very Long Engagement.""In any event a flyboy movie exists for its flying sequences and once it gets aloft ``Flyboys"" is reasonably ripping. Combining actual aerial footage and computer-generated special effects the scenes have the dramatic crackle thats lacking on the ground and the inclusion of deadly webs of CGI tracer-fire adds a new dimension to the swoops and rollovers and Immelmanns . Ill let the aviation-history wonks parse the realism of the bi planes; on action terms the movie succeeds.It succeeds so well that you spend the last 10 minutes hoping the screenwriters and director Tony Bill wont honor cliche a final time and have one character come in for a final shot of glory. They do of course. What are the guns of Germany against all the stereotypes Hollywood can muster?Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

Flight film fans and the idly curious will check it out but the masses wont be mobilized for this MGM release at least not in theaters. ""Flyboys"" is an old-fashioned boys adventure version of an arresting chapter in World War I history about the enterprising bunch of young Americans who flew with the French before the United States entered the war. Lovingly and knowledgeably made by director Tony Bill who got his pilots license as a teenager pic nonetheless has a lightweight airbrushed feel; despite the brutal dogfights and inevitable deaths theres little gravity or resonance. Flight film fans and the idly curious will check it out but the masses wont be mobilized for this MGM release at least not in theaters. That not a single soul not even a Frenchman smokes in this film tells you pics portrait of the war has been sanitized for modern consumption. Even the 1958 picture about the same unit William Wellmans ""Lafayette Escadrille"" had the Yank leading man played by Tab Hunter fall for a French hooker; here the love interest is a virtuous young thing who looks after her dead brothers orphaned kids. Nearly all of the major Hollywood pictures about WWI aviators made in the late 20s and early 30s -- Wellmans ""Wings"" and ""Legion of the Condemned"" Hawks ""The Dawn Patrol"" Howard Hughes ""Hells Angels"" William Dieterles unduly neglected ""The Last Flight"" -- underline the bitter fatalism of these warriors who while the most glamorous figures in uniform had a life expectancy once they started flying of three to six weeks. They were beautiful stoics alcoholic knights of the air the poster boys for the Lost Generation; veteran pilots wouldnt even speak to new arrivals at first knowing many of them would be dead in short order. These tidbits are mentioned in the efficient but formulaic script by Blake Evans Phil Sears and David S. Ward (the latter Bills cohort from ""The Sting"") but they come across as items on a checklist rather than as facts that might have shaped attitudes and contributed to a mildly despairing pre-existential philosophy of life. ""Flyboys"" is intended as a 90-years-on salute to these adventurers but its bright-eyed and bushy-tailed perspective denies the tale true grit or the barest hint of tragedy. The small band of Yanks gathered together in 1916 have come to France for different reasons. Among them are Blaine Rawlings (James Franco) a laconic Texan whose family has just lost its ranch; William Jensen (Philip Winchester) a son of a soldier; Briggs Lowry (Tyler Labine) an upper class lout who needs to become a man; Eugene Skinner (Abdul Salis) a black expat boxer appreciative of how France has treated him; and Eddie Beagle (David Ellison) an odd fellow with a mysterious past. Ensconced in a fabulous chateau they train under the benevolent eye of Captain Thenault (Jean Reno bearing more than a passing resemblance here to Charles de Gaulle) and at a detached distance from charismatic squadron leader Reed Cassidy (Martin Henderson). Director Bills desire to communicate the minutiae of flying comes through vividly The biplanes were rickety fragile things fabric pulled over wire and a few struts; the controls were dreadfully imprecise; the machine guns often jammed; flying and aiming at the same time was tough and so much more did the military value the planes over the pilots that no parachutes were provided. The aviation-yarn format requires several airborne missions separated by earthbound downtime with the latter increasingly devoted to Rawlings puppy dog devotion to lovely Lucienne (Jennifer Decker) whose life with the kids on a nearby farm becomes threatened by the encroaching Germans. The corny scenes between them are made agreeable enough by the actors charm as well as by the way the characters slowly compensate for the fact that each speaks not a word of the others language. But the main action is in the air where a vigorous combination of real footage and extensive CGI makes for dynamic and complicated maneuvers of the sort that are routine in outer space movies and videogames but havent been seen before in WWI fare (with the momentary exception of ""The Aviator""). In many interludes it is impossible to tell where the six actual planes leave off and the computer-generated ones begin and perhaps never has the difficulty of lining up a moving target in a wobbly plane and getting off an accurate shot been better demonstrated. The film also shows the chaos of squadron-to-squadron combat. Bill placed great importance on expressing the chivalry and mutual respect between enemies in the air; pics most upsetting moments come when the implicit aviators code is transgressed by the German arch-villain. But these genre niceties are not going to mean much to young modern audiences and the vanilla-flavored storytelling fails to make the revisiting of a distant war relevant; the nostalgia is not unpleasant but in terms of tough-mindedness its miles away from the trenchant entertainments that were embraced by the public not long after the war itself. Francos carryover James Dean posings early on serve his characters gruff coverup of a wounded soul but the actor is best when he smiles and becomes personable. French stage thesp Decker is comely and promising Salis has a sensitive upbeat appeal as the initial odd man out who comes to love flying more than any of them and Henderson obviously enjoyed draping himself in the accoutrements of romantic danger. Shot in England pic is handsomely and credibly appointed in all departments.

Evans Phil Sears David S. Ward; Release Date Wide 09/22/2006; Runtime (in minutes) 139; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor MGM Posted September 20 2006 -- 1200 AM EDT Its been a while since the last truly rousing WWI dogfight films Wings came out in 1927 Hells Angels in 1930. (No 1966s The Blue Max isnt good enough.) The time is ripe for a new ""Red Baron"" movie. Which makes Flyboys pedestrian drama -- about a group of Yanks who move to France to battle tri-wing German fighters -- and videogame lameness all the lamer This is a lost opportunity on an epic scale. The actors are so styled and the dogfights so drippy with CG that as a period piece the movie almost looks like its set in the future.
