Credit Freestyle Sometimes a film feels a bit too pat and yet is impossible to resist. ""The Mighty Macs"" based on the national championship run of the 1972 womens basketball team at Immaculata College near Philadelphia is such a film lots of button pushing but in the end youre glad you saw it.Carla Gugino plays Cathy Rush a first-time coach (now in the Basketball Hall of Fame) who takes over a doormat team and with relentless practices that sometimes border on abusive shows its players how to win.Ellen Burstyn is Mother St. John the head of the college who is more worried about keeping the institution open than about properly outfitting and equipping a basketball team. David Boreanaz (a star of the Fox show ""Bones"") plays Ms. Rushs husband Ed in a thinly drawn characterization that is supposed to represent male spouses who struggle with the notion that their wives might want careers.The whole female-empowerment subplot of the film feels a bit out of phase more 50s than 70s. And the Cinderella nature of the teams run isnt quite as remarkable as it would be today back then what was called the national championship tournament had only 16 teams in contrast to the N.C.A.A. behemoth we know now.That said you have to love seeing nuns shouting basketball strategy from courtside. And the updates on the teams players that flash by at the films end drive home why this is a sports story that deserved to be told.THE MIGHTY MACSOpens on Friday in Manhattan. Written produced and directed by Tim Chambers; co-written by Anthony Gargano; director of photography Chuck Cohen; Whitney Springer producer. Running time 1 hour 38 minutes. This film is rated G.

Quaker Media Carla Gugino in ""The Mighty Macs"" (Quaker Media) If you think that the sports-underdog genre has exhausted every angle you havent met ""The Mighty Macs."" This true story fills a needed niche spotlighting womens basketball in the era before Title IX promoted equal treatment.Without resorting to any trick plays ""The Mighty Macs"" is the equivalent of high-top Converse All-Stars timeless and effective but perhaps not flashy enough for the kids at the mall.In 1971 a woman named Cathy Rush (Carla Gugino stretching her wings) accepts a job to coach the basketball team at a tiny all-girls Catholic school in eastern Pennsylvania called Immaculata College. Rush is the wife of an NBA referee (David Boreanaz) who is bemused by Cathys ambitions but the marital tension is underplayed. Likewise although rustling a team from the marriage-minded student body seems like an obvious subplot the movie concentrates on Cathys struggle for funds and facilities to compete with the larger schools. Her adversary is Mother St. John (Ellen Burstyn) but the movie doesnt delve deeply enough into the conflicts between a nun and a bell-bottomed proto-feminist who isnt even Catholic.Thankfully theres a spunky young nun/assistant coach (Marley Shelton) to represent progressive sisterhood. And while the backstories of the student-athletes are underdeveloped once the girls get on the court theres plenty of the unconventional training montages and conventional nail-biter finishes we expect from a basketball movie in the ""Hoosiers"" mode. In the spectrum of sports movies ""The Mighty Macs"" is an uncontested layup.

Inspired by the adventures of the 1972 womens basketball squad at the Catholic school Immaculata College in Philadelphia the movie makes the most of the versatile Gugino as Cathy Rush the headstrong and unorthodox new coach who stuns her charges with her frank talk and strange new ideas. The movie checks off every item on the list of sports-movie cliches from oddball training methods (Rush has the girls train in a drainpipe) to the threat of outside perils (the college is in dire financial trouble) to clashes with the boss (Ellen Burstyn as the Mother Superior) to a reach for sociopolitical significance (in this case equal rights for women as Rushs husband tells her she should be more of a conventional wife). Everything plays out exactly as youd expect in a cheerful well-meaning movie in the style of something made for the Disney channel.

(Matt Rourke/AP) Joe Neumaier Friday October 21 2011 400 AM Title The Mighty Macs With Carla Gugino Ellen Burstyn. A woman gets a job coaching a high school basketball team. Director Tim Chambers (137). G. At area theaters.Carla Gugino has yet to find the right movie that clicks with her spunky outsider appeal but ""The Mighty Macs"" a gauzy inspiring true-life drama about a girls basketball team at least gets her close and provides a lot of assists.Gugino plays Cathy Rush a once-promising basketball player who gave up the game after she got married. Her life in the early 1970s is a stifling mix of watching her husband (David Boreanaz) referee NBA games while wishing she could find a job that suited her. She comes upon it at Pennsylvanias Immaculata college a strict Catholic girls school that needs a coach.The schools Mother Superior (Ellen Burstyn) sees that while Cathy is a firebrand shes also a find since shell do the job for less than the school was prepared to pay. Cathy of course would have done it for free.The team is the usual mix of squirrelly and defiant personalities - writer-director Tim Chambers shortchanges them and us by resorting to cliches - but the amiable young nun Sister Sunday (Marley Shelton) becomes Cathys confidante and assistant coach. Sunday devout but not humorless has given up things as well and she and Cathy wind up turning the Immaculata squad nicknamed the ""Mighty Macs"" into a winning team.The movies look courtesy of cinematographer Chuck Cohen tries to evoke ""Hoosiers"" and the film feels at times like a farm-team ""Dead Poets Society."" But theres something refreshingly unpushy about the movie and its beliefs and Gugino seems to be sauntering through on her way to a different spikier movie the kind that is her stock in trade.The sweet surprise here is that she doesnt appear to be doing penance and the movie rises to match her.Magic Moment Cathy and Sister Sunday share a beer and different views of lifes paths.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"Underdog sports drama The Mighty Macs Review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review Underdog sports drama The Mighty MacsThe story of the 1972 Immaculata College womens basketball team rise to the national championship is told in by-the numbers fashion.October 21 2011|By Gary Goldstein Special to the Los Angeles Times Meghan Sabia left Taylor Steel Marley Shelton and Carla Gugino are seen... (Matt Rourke / Associated...)Theres seemingly no end to the true-life underdog sports dramas available for a cinematic close-up. Unfortunately the latest entry ""The Mighty Macs"" is given such old-fashioned kid-gloves treatment that its potential warmth and excitement caves under the weight of writer-producer-director Tim Chambers good intentions. Based on the story of suburban Philadelphias Immaculata College womens basketball team which went from virtual obscurity to winning the sports first-ever national womens collegiate championships in 1972 under progressive new coach a and ex-hoopster a Cathy Rush (Carla Gugino) the film opts for by-the-numbers plotting and inspirational speeches over serious character development and emotional depth. Given its Catholic school setting Chambers doesnt overplay the ""higher power"" of it all yet does keep things conspicuously cloistered from the eras social racial and political strife. Womens lib is touched on but hardly in bold strokes. Gugino brings requisite resolve to her portrayal of the driven ""theres no I in team"" Cathy but is limited by her roles narrowly written range. Ellen Burstyn is wonderfully dry as Immaculatas beleaguered Mother Superior though her shift from sourpuss to beaming booster feels too abrupt. As a questioning young nun who becomes Cathys assistant coach Marley Shelton adds charm but David Boreanaz can only do so much with the thankless part of Cathys conflicted NBA-referee husband. calendarlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVES2013 Fall Movie Preview complete listAugust 30 2013Was Orel Hershiser cut by his high school baseball team?November 28 2012Movie review Chico amp; RitaMarch 9 201294 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER  They Hitch a Ride on Dreams and a PrayerFebruary 21 1994MOVIE REVIEW  Sure-Footed Strictly Ballroom Makes All the Right MovesFebruary 12 1993MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesEntertainmentBasketball TeamCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/reviews/la-et-mighty-macs-20111021,0,4410582.story?track=rss",200,themightymacs4,themightymacs,latimes

Starring Carly Gugino Marley Shelton and Ellen Burstyn. Directed by Tim Chambers. (G. 102 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Mighty Macs"" is a typical sports movie given a little extra something by the fact that its all about women. Not only is it about a womens basketball team but the team is from a womens college and the school is run by nuns. Based on the true story of Cathy Rush (Carla Gugino) and her work at Immaculata College it takes place in 1972 a time of transition for women in America. Rush with no previous experience takes the coaching job for little pay - its something she just needs to do. Meanwhile her husband does every passive-aggressive thing he can think of to make her feel bad about it Injured looks long silences when he is forced to eat takeout and belittling comments. And hes supposed to be a sympathetic and reasonably decent guy. Related Stories Starting with nothing and trying to win it all Id forgotten but this is what men were like 40 years ago. If a wife wanted to do something outside the home the husband would make her life difficult. (In that same year 1972 when my mother got a job my father acted for six months as if she was trying to take a machete to his manhood.) This was real folks and in the grand scheme it wasnt even that long ago. ""Mighty Macs"" further distinguishes itself by for once giving a fair shake to nuns who are treated with respect both in the performance of Ellen Burstyn as the mother superior and of Marley Shelton who plays the assistant coach. Its about time. These are notable virtues and yet if you add all that up it still doesnt budge ""Mighty Macs"" out of the category of a routine experience. Sports movies live and die by what takes place on the court or in the field and this one feels rather rote. Not bad and certainly watchable but with nothing especially gripping about the process the strategies or the games themselves. Gugino is a pleasure to watch as the taskmaster and inspiration to the kids and she has a nice sisterly rapport with Shelton. As for Burstyn picture her as a mother superior. Got that picture in your head? Ok now you can stay home. Youve already seen the performance - in your mind. E-mail Mick LaSalle at mlasallesfchronicle.com.

""The Mighty Macs"" is a standard longshot-underdogs-go-the-distance yarn the true story of a ragtag team that won the first national championship in womens college basketball. Immaculata College a Catholic girls school outside Philadelphia had no gymnasium no athletics budget and scant support for a basketball program in 1971. The near-bankrupt schools president Mother St. John (Ellen Burstyn) just wants a physical activity to burn off a few of the students hormones. Things change with the arrival of Cathy Rush (Carla Gugino) a woman not content to sit on the sidelines of life. A former player married to an NBA referee Cathys a go-getter with a gift for motivational speeches diagramming plays encouraging her young athletes and when necessary chewing them out. Her zeal attracts Sister Sunday (Marley Shelton) who signs on to help coach the team while struggling with her own growing doubts about life in the order. ""The Mighty Macs"" isnt stylish entertainment and it doesnt have especially high aspirations but theres a soothing decency about it. Written directed and produced by Tim Chambers who has a personal connection to Immaculata and an innate sense of where to put his camera the film possesses a charming bittersweet authenticity. The parish priest preaches to a half-full church. The poor students dress poor and work at mop-and-bucket jobs. The nuns feel theyre being left behind by a changing world. Donations are dwindling vocations are declining and one nun ruefully jokes ""In a few years well be an exhibit at the Smithsonian."" While the 1970s were a scary time for people who felt their values were being overturned the social upheaval was exciting too. Cathys ardor to build a top-tier team injects a sense of hope in the little school and scores a few points for feminism along the way. A woman devoted to a cause really can work miracles it seems and can do so without having to be an imitation man. Gugino wears snappy figure-flaunting outfits to work and conducts team trust-building exercises around helping one of the students choose an appropriate shade of lipstick. Gugino is a spunky winning presence (though at 40 shes 17 years older than Rush was when she started coaching the Immaculata team) and Burstyn is dauntingly dour and prickly as the hard-to-convince Mother Superior. The young players scarcely register as individual personalities and the on-court action youve seen before. Still the comforting time-honored formula of David and Goliath contests and last-second tiebreakers remains infallible. Quaker Media Quaker Media Carla Gugino right as coach Cathy Rush in ""the Mighty Macs."" ""The Mighty Macs"" is no slam dunk but its a very pleasant hour and a half in the bleachers.

More specifically 1971. More about The Mighty Macs >> That year some female hoops competitors still wore skirts on the hardwood. Almost as many still played by the old-school womens rules of half court. As Tim Chambers film tells it at what was then called Immaculata College a females-only institution on the brink of insolvency there wasnt even a half court to play on when Cathy Rush (Carla Gugino) as bold as she was beautiful took the coaching job. Thats because the gym had burned down. Macs presents Rush as a cheeky New Woman who renews the hope and faith of a musty old school where to be a woman was to be submissive. With the assistance of a hoops-wise novice Sister Sunday (Marley Shelton) Rush drills it into her team that theres no deference in basketball. The ball thrust into Rushs hands by Immaculatas Mother Superior (Ellen Burstyn) is deflated and dinged beyond repair. Its emblematic both of the resources and the morale on campus when Rush arrives. ""Our last ball"" says the nun sternly. ""Dont lose it."" Without a gym uniforms or committed players Rush builds a team and school pride. The Macs cheerleaders - a flock of nuns who know their pick-and-roll - bring an alternative meaning to the 70s slogan ""sisterhood is powerful."" The Mighty Macs was written and directed with obvious affection by Chambers the former director of the Pennsylvania Film Office. He was a 10-year-old in Newtown Square when he watched the team practice in the gym at his parish school. His genial tale of team building is not quite the Sister Act of the courts. Pleasing rather than rousing informational rather than inspirational Macs is more of a sit-in-the-bleachers-and-clap than a stand-up-and-cheer affair. This story of a team is mostly about Rush a high school hoops star who was cut from her team and who in coaching the Macs settled scores with the coach who didnt value her talents. One wishes that Chambers had more gracefully integrated the stories of the individual players into this celebration of Rush. Still it is hard to resist the warmth and authority of Gugino who resembles the Police Woman-era Angie Dickinson with Farrah Fawcett hair.

Starring Carla Gugino David Boreanaz Marley Shelton Ellen Burstyn Jennifer Butler Director Tim Chambers Running time 140 Release Opened Oct 21 2011  Editorial Review Hoop dreams that fall flatBy Stephanie MerryFriday Oct 21 2011Stop me if youve heard this one A hapless obscure underdog team overcomes countless disadvantages to become undisputed champions. Theres a reason so many variations on this theme - from ""Miracle"" to ""Dodgeball"" - have emerged. It has the makings for an inspiring nail-biting and feel-good couple of hours. But ""The Mighty Macs"" one of the few female versions of the inspirational sports story proves that basic outline alone is not enough. The true tale of a girls basketball team at a small Catholic college in Pennsylvania is all platitudes and no personality. This new addition to the genre is more ""Sister Act"" than ""Hoosiers"" thanks to its setting of the all-female nun-run Immaculata College. The year is 1971 and Cathy Rush (Carla Gugino) has just gotten married but has no plans of becoming a housewife despite the protestations of her NBA referee husband played by David Boreanaz of ""Bones"" and ""Buffy"" fame. Rather than fill her days with baking pies and dusting Rush takes a job as the basketball coach for the tiny school which has no money no gym a single ball and a pile of outdated dresses as uniforms. Adding to those initial obstacles Cathy clashes with the unsmiling Mother Superior (Ellen Burstyn) and a ragtag bunch of players who are more interested in getting married and appearing ladylike than perfecting their jump shots. In stereotypical fashion Cathy initially repels everyone with her unorthodox methods. She starts practice at 7 a.m. arranges scrimmages against boys and forces the girls to run drills late at night in the freezing cold in a drainage pipe. But just when the odds begin to seem insurmountable a crew of nuns comes to Cathys aid including the religiously conflicted young Sister Sunday (Marley Shelton) who volunteers to be the assistant coach. On paper the accomplishments of this team are spectacular but its hard to get past the feeling that writer-director Tim Chambers was checking off items on a list titled Elements of a Cinderella Story. Cathy fits the archetype yet she doesnt feel like a complete person. She speaks almost exclusively in inspirational one-liners including ""Short tall fast or small its our voice that makes us one"" and ""Dreams are for everybody."" She might as well be a talking toy that spouts off trite proverbs. The players feel just as superficially drawn. And while its amusing at first to see nuns cheering from the stands to ""watch the pick and roll"" that comedic element wears thin after a while. It all amounts to a missed opportunity considering how many female athletes and sports fans would probably flock to the first film that targets their demographic since ""A League of Their Own"" nearly 20 years ago. The people behind ""The Mighty Macs"" could learn a lot from that film especially that following formula is fine as long as you dont skimp on the details that complete the portrait.Contains nothing objectionable.

"Mighty Macs movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Coach Gugino leads the way in The Mighty Macs -- 3 starsOctober 20 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticCarla Gugino stars in ""Mighty Macs.""When the monsignor in ""The Mighty Macs"" announces that ""itll take an act of God to save this school"" his mission is clear. Hes setting up the act of God for an on-time arrival.The acts headliner is Carla Gugino a pleasure to watch in almost anything.Filmed in 2009 writer-producer-director Tim Chambers low budget high-fructose but generally effective rouser showcases Gugino as suburban Philadelphia Immaculata College basketball coach Cathy Rush who in the early 1970s led her all-girl Catholic underdog team to long-shot glory.The film costars Ellen Burstyn as the crusty Mother Superior the one most likely to star in her own film someday ""Where Angels Dribble ... Trouble Follows.""Chambers film may be clunky in its visual technique but something good and true happens whenever Gugino and her young cohorts many of them non-professionals making their film debuts get the time and space to simply relate to each other on screen. Married to NBA referee Ed Rush (David Boreanaz) Coach Rush goes about the business of assembling the best team she can at a school barely able to keep its doors open or afford a pump for the basketball.Demanding but honest the coach assisted by Sister Sunday (Marley Shelton) delivers the axioms (""Our results will not change until our habits change"") in between serious skill-improving drills including one in which the players scramble sideways at night in a storm drain.The tactics and tough love work even if some of the scripts lines (""Sometimes angels wear high heels"" its noted at one point) do not while others (""Thats what Im talkin about"") dont sound much like 1972.Which wont bother too many people lets be honest. Rated G with a vengeance ""The Mighty Macs"" wears its religious and inspirational qualities openly and casually. The film doesnt pretend to be anything other than what it is a story of one woman overcoming low expectations. Gugino and Burstyn and the young performers playing the young players do likewise.mjphillipstribune.comThe Mighty Macs -- 3 starsMPAA rating G (language)Cast Carla Gugino (Cathy Rush); David Boreanaz (Ed Rush); Marley Shelton (Sister Sunday); Ellen Burstyn (Mother St. John)Credits Written produced and directed by Tim Chambers.

But even at that price the first feature by Tim Chambers is profligate with sports-movie cliches. Happily agreeing to a salary of 450 for the 1971-72 season Cathy (Carla Gugino) a young bride married to an NBA referee turns the sad squad at run-down single-sex Catholic Immaculata College into victors primarily by asking rhetorical questions such as ""Who here likes to win?"" and ""How much are you willing to sacrifice?"" Yet despite its unrelenting corniness The Mighty Macs admirably tries to honor the achievements of second-wave feminism. Always a trooper Gugino brings dignity and energy to the affirmation-spouting bio-doodle she plays striding proudly onto the court in butterfly collars and snug blazers (about the only period detail attended to). Although the young women she coaches remain blurs Cathy does form a strong bond with a nun (Marley Shelton) and finally wins over the abbess (Ellen Burstyn)--proving however literally that sisterhood really is powerful.

Family-friendly and abounding in uplift ""The Mighty Macs"" is an undemandingly pleasant indie drama about the true-life exploits of the 1971-72 Immaculata College basketball team which set a new standard for achievement in womens sports. Pic is so persuasively evocative of its period setting and so similar in tone and language to G-rated fare produced during that period that it wouldnt be surprising if decades from now some unwary viewers actually mistake it for a 70s release. Right now it should score with auds seeking wholesome theatrical and homevid entertainment. Indeed ""Mighty Macs"" conceivably could tap into the same demo drawn to recent faith-based pics even though despite the preponderance of nuns and references to God throughout it qualifies more as a mainstream megaplex offering with potentially broader appeal. Carla Gugino is aptly feisty as Cathy Rush depicted here as a budding feminist happily married to an NBA ref (David Boreanaz) but determined to establish her own identity. She finally lands the job opportunity she seeks at Pennsylvanias Immaculata College a liberal-arts university limited exclusively to women at the time where sports of any sort have low priority. Mother St. John (Ellen Burstyn) the harshly pragmatic dean warns that Immaculata doesnt have a gym a history of athletic accomplishment or even a budget for team uniforms. Worse Immaculata is in such bad financial shape the institution may be sold to land developers. What the school needs is divine intervention. What is gets is a feisty basketball coach who demands total commitment and disciplined teamwork from her players even if they have to play in really really unflattering dresses that oddly resemble Judy Garlands attire in ""The Wizard of Oz."" ""The Mighty Macs"" follows a story arc previously traced by countless other sports pics as Rush encourages her players to transcend their defeatist mindset and after a few early humiliating losses prove their prowess. But theres a feminist touch to this particular version of the oft-recycled scenario as the coach helps a cash-strapped sartorially challenged player (Katie Hayek) boost her self-esteem and inspires a marriage-obsessed beauty (Kim Blair) to be all she can be on the court after her boyfriend dumps her. And while its religious content is limited largely to gags involving cute nuns and their lovable quirks the film deals sympathetically with the crisis of faith endured by a young novitiate Sister Sunday (winningly played by Marley Shelton). Even auds who know nothing about Rushs real-life coaching successes will have no trouble figuring out early on where ""Mighty Macs"" will wind up. Writer-director Tim Chambers does little to generate suspense and appears determined to immediately defuse any situation that even hints at the possibility of unpleasantness. When Rushs husband complains about feeling neglected the argument ends before it really starts. And a guy who comes on to Rush and Sister Sunday (while the latter isnt wearing clerical garb) in a roadside tavern turns out to be the most polite barroom Romeo in movie history. From Gugino as the demanding coach to Hayek as the poor but proud MVP perfs across the board are earnest and engaging. Burstyn does a nice job of lacing her characters sternness with dollops of dry wit particularly when she announces her low expectations where Rushs efforts are concerned ""Ill be satisfied if you just use these activities to repress their hormones."" Production values evoke the period with Norman Greenbaums ""Spirit in the Sky"" used to the point of cliche in this kind of film here excerpted quite appropriately.
