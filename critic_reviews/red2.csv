Former CIA agent Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) is happy with the quiet life but his girlfriend Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) is bored. When it comes to Frank and Sarah the attraction is action suggests their buddy Marvin (John Malkovich). So the trio embarks on a mission to keep a next-generation weapon out of terrorist hands. This takes them to Paris (enter Catherine Zeta-Jones) London (hello Helen Mirren) and Moscow. It should be a zippy ride but stale dialogue and a bored-looking Bruce Willis slow things down. Parker Malkovich and Mirren wring a few laughs out of the script before scene-stealer Anthony Hopkins brightens the mood as a retired physicist who may or may not be insane. Ultimately its popcorn nihilism without the big laughs that helped distract from the casual approach to life and death in Red. To quote Austin Powers People never think how things affect the family of a henchman. Now that was funny.

If you didnt then you almost certainly wont like it. I feel it is a bit like the Ocean Eleven films as this runs out of ideas after a pretty good first film before half way in this film. if there is a third film I probably wont bother going. On a quiet weekend for cinema releases not a bad film just not really good enough to warrant paying full price. If you want to chance it I would suggest Wednesday night on a 2 for 1 deal with a friend. Its an ok 2 star film not really good enough to be a 3 star though.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreAug 2 2013DimitrisFeaturedIts so boring I couldnt wait for it to end. The plot is a mess there is no rhythm the jokes are nonsensical and the action is forgettable.

Mary-Louise Parker Bruce Willis (center) and John Malkovich play characters who find plenty of action in ""Red 2"" a likable action comedy. Photo Summit Entertainment2013 Red 2 review Hopkins steals the show 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Red 2 Action. Starring Bruce Willis John Malkovich Helen Mirren and Mary-Louise Parker. Directed by Dean Parisot. (PG-13. 116 minutes.) About halfway through ""Red 2"" in the midst of all the laughs and action suddenly Anthony Hopkins shows up and he doesnt care one bit that nobody is going to notice his acting in a movie like this. Hes going for the Oscar anyway. As a scientist who has been locked up by an intelligence agency for 31 years - he was such a genius at creating bombs he was deemed too dangerous to be let loose - Hopkins plays several varieties of nut simultaneously. A jovial nut. A scary nut. A nut who thinks hes only pretending to be nuts etc. But heres the beautiful thing Sometimes if you take a genuinely great actor and put him in an outlandish role hell make psychological sense of that role while in no way reining in the crazy. Give him something big and hell give you something great. This is what Hopkins does in ""Red 2."" The movie is what you might expect. Like every other cinematic extravaganza these days its a light entertainment about the threat of annihilation - fine on its own terms and Hopkins is just one actor in it. Yet what an unexpected find a performance that shows the invention playfulness and quickness of mind that we associate with this actor at his best. As in 2010s ""Red"" the sequel is about old CIA agents who find that every time they think theyre out something pulls them back in. In this case its a secret from the past A top-secret operation that went disastrously wrong in 1979 looks as though it soon might be exposed. Even worse there are people so intent on keeping it secret that theyre willing to kill everyone ever connected with the mission and among these are - no surprise - Bruce Willis and John Malkovich as Frank and Marvin respectively best friends and CIA partners for decades. As the movie starts Frank is retired and settling into domesticity with his corn-fed Kansas girlfriend Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) and their screen relationship is a fun component of the movie He wants to settle down but she wants action. Willis is the anchor of the film the effortless leading man the guy were so willing to watch that we almost take him for granted so easy is his command of the medium. And Parker is a big part of the movies fun playing Sarah as instinctive and clueless and yet always watching and thinking. ""Red 2"" maintains a tone throughout that allows for the possibility of truly horrible things happening. Theres violence and death at every turn and the threat of something worse - something nuclear - gives the movie urgency. At the same time theres a light quality about it not cartoony but of a comedy grounded in character and the weird combination somehow works This is a likable almost gentle comedy and also a violent action film about the possibility of a nuclear bomb going off in a major city. The movie has odd turns and surprises and always keeps moving except at one point when the story hits a snag. It comes about an hour in when the good guys and the despised bad guys both find themselves working on the same side only they dont know it. This state of affairs goes on for only about 10 or 15 minutes (until a new villain emerges) but in that time the air goes out of the balloon. ""Red 2"" does regain its footing but thats a major flaw in the design. Malkovich is the comedian to Willis straight man and has some of the best lines. Catherine Zeta-Jones shows up playing a Russian agent looking even more stunning than she did at age 22 which for the record was 21 years ago. So between Hopkins and Zeta-Jones ""Red 2"" is a very good movie for the Welsh. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

So to put his mind at ease several lines were added to the script to make it clear that she was the infatuated predator and he merely her reluctant prey. The happy result was an all-time classic of the caper-comedy genre. (If youve never seen the film seize the earliest opportunity to do so Charade is the best Alfred Hitchcock movie ever made by someone who was not Alfred Hitchcock.) Grant made just two more pictures before retiring from the screen altogether at age 62. Related Story A Beautiful Disappointing Pacific Rim Judging from the later-life careers of stars as disparate as Jack Nicholson and Woody Allen were past the point at which older male icons are likely to express any embarrassment at romancing much-younger co-stars. But can we at least agree as a society on an age at which actors should renounce automatic weapons? The idea of Getting the Old Gang Back Together for One Last Blowout isnt a new one. (To whit Space Cowboys back in 2000.) But of late the retirees-with-RPGs flick has quietly evolved into a whole subgenre of its own the Expendables franchise the extension of the Die Hard series RED and its new sequel RED 2. In the midst of this particular phenomenon stands Bruce Willis--star of the latter two franchises and a co-star of the former--in all his Roman-nosed shaven-headed glory. The actor is still on the tender side of 60 (he turned 58 in March) and he is self-evidently capable of kicking the asses of men considerably younger than himself. But at some point shouldnt he consider an alternative pastime? Willis can be a gifted subtle performer as hes recently displayed in such films as Moonrise Kingdomand Looper. But at just the moment in his career when one might expect him to explore his range hes instead narrowed it disappointingly His next five announced projects are another Die Hard another Expendables a sequel to Sin City and two more movies--American Assassin and Expiration--in which he plays hit men. Im all for showing the younger fellas how its done but surely there must be a limit. I cant be the only film-goer made nervous by the prospect of Die Hard With a Pension. Which brings me somewhat reluctantly to RED 2 itself. Unlike many I was not a fan of the first RED. But I suspect even those who enjoyed it will find their patience tested by this profoundly unnecessary sequel. As before the gag is summed up in the title which is spook-speak shorthand for ""retired extremely dangerous."" Former black-ops superstar Frank Moses (Willis) is quietly minding his own business (this time out ""playing house"" with the Mary-Louise Parker character he courted in the previous movie) when the lethal aftershocks of a decades-old mission abruptly arrive on his doorstep. Moses again reassembles his generationally compatible cohort of old spies (John Malkovich Helen Mirren Brian Cox) and together they treat us to just under two hours of escalating mayhem. Joining the festivities for this installment are Anthony Hopkins (a weapons scientist dubbed the ""rock star of conceptual mass-killing"" and ""Da Vinci of death""); Catherine Zeta-Jones (a KGB agent and former paramour described as ""Frank Mosess kryptonite""); and Lee Byung-hun (""the best contract killer in the world""--a title the film so wishes to emphasize that it bestows it on him twice verbatim in the span of five minutes). Im all for showing the younger fellas how its done but surely there must be a limit. I cant be the only film-goer made nervous by the prospect of Die Hard With a Pension. The plot such as it is revolves around a secret nuclear device that the United States and Britain planted somewhere in Moscow in the late 1970s and then--oops--forgot all about. But such narrative details are secondary to the movies recurring jokes which are trundled out repeatedly and to diminishing effect Willis wants to keep Parker safe but she craves adventure; Parker is jealous of Zeta-Jones and so resolves to unleash her own awkward inner Mata Hari; Cox gets turned on by watching Mirren shoot people; Malkovich is crazy (look hes blowing up the toilets); and of course theyre all old. Throughout the entire cast seems only superficially committed to the enterprise at hand--though in fairness its hard to imagine what even the most inspired performer could make of such lines as ""Frank you havent killed anyone in months"" and ""What happens in the Kremlin stays in the Kremlin."" The direction (by Dean Parisot) is competent but unimaginative and the body count while never graphic is childishly excessive. Despite a few moments of moderate wit--most of them in the early going--RED 2 inadvertently makes the case that for franchises as well as spooks sometimes retirement really is the best option.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Continue Reading Channel 4 The Prescience of Brass Eye 15 Years Later David Sims Chris Morriss brutal satire aired its last and most controversial episode in 2001 but its skewering of the news media feels more relevant than ever. A sex offender is thrown in the stocks presented with a small child and asked if he wants to molest him. A mob of protestors is thrown a ""dummy full of guts"" that is stomped to pieces within seconds. A radio host insists that pedophiles have ""more genes in common with crabs"" than the rest of humanity insisting ""Theres no real evidence for [that] but it is scientific fact."" Its hard to pinpoint the most cringe-inducing moment on ""Paedogeddon"" a special episode of the British TV satire Brass Eye. But 15 years after the episode aired it remains a totemic terrifying satirical vision. Few comedies since have dared to cross the boundaries of taste with such impunity. ""Paedogeddon"" aired in the U.K. in the summer of 2001 a year after the murder of a young girl had sparked national hysteria over the countrys sex-offender registry. Britains most-read newspaper led a campaign to publish the names and locations of all 110000 convicted sex offenders prompting a riot in which an angry mob ransacked the home of an ex-con. Brass Eye a parody of a 60 Minutes-like newsmagazine show had been dormant after airing one season in the UK in 1997. But it returned four years later for this surprise broadcast one that saw its furious (fictional) anchors barking from a dark studio about the plague of seemingly super-powered child molesters stalking the nation holding a funhouse mirror up to the climate of paranoia and fear that had built up around the country. It was a bold wildly insensitive piece of comedy but one that captured the growing madness of the 24-hour news media and foreshadowed some uglier aspects of its future.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post PG-13. 107 minutes. At area theaters. In late-summer 2010 a film featuring some ace actors as expert killers whod honed their lethal skill sets during the Cold Wars end arrived in the multiplex. Starring Bruce Willis as one-time CIA black-ops specialist Frank Moses ""Red"" was charming in a smirky way befitting its lead character and violent in an absurd magazine-emptying explosive fashion also befitting its star. Based on the D.C. graphic novel by Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner ""Red"" was a sleeper surprise. Ridiculously action-packed and just as endearing ""Red 2"" is why we go to sequels despite our well-earned cynicism about studios churning them out. On their best day sequels reunite characters we want to spend more time with doing the things that made us like them in the first place in an engaging and fresh story. At the start of this ride Frank and wide-eyed civilian Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) are still together. Frank is committed to doing his domestic best thereby keeping Sarah safe when old friend Marvin (John Malkovich) tracks them down. The CIA believes Marvin and Frank know something about a Cold War weapons project called Nightshade a weapon of mass destruction a number of governments do not want to come to light and a few more want to get their hands on. Pringles an arms dealer named ""the Frog"" and a murderous U.S. official portrayed with icy arrogance by Neal McDonough all figure into the plot which never comes off as throwaway. The on-screen chemistry of its characters (and their portrayers) is the draw. Anthony Hopkins portrays Edward Bailey the scientist MI-6 has in extreme lock-down. He may hold the key (and there are plenty of them throughout ""Red 2"") to the Nightshade mystery. Director Dean Parisot and returning screenwriters Eric and Jon Hoeber mix a lovely and absurd dose of relationship humor into headlong nearly cartoon-like action and violence. Like the original film this one takes pleasure in toying with the tension between the familiar (in this case keeping a relationship fresh) and the exotic (saving the world). Malkovichs mix of deadpan sweetness and lunacy is gradually pushing Marvin into the pantheon of indelible big-screen comedic characters. Here he becomes chief relationship counselor. Although theres no shortage of opinion when it comes to Frank and Sarahs relationship. Frank wants to keep Sarah safe. Everyone else seems to recognize her desire to live a bit more dangerously. Sarah is the character with the fullest arc. After all Frank Victoria (Helen Mirren having her larky way with a character) Marvin and Ivan (Brian Cox) have lived full lives. With one foot in the real world and a hankering for clandestine adventure shes our onscreen avatar. Parker plays her with a readiness to embrace her fellas past. To a point. Where that point is is among the films smartest ongoing jokes. And running into Franks old flame and nemesis Katja (Catherine Zeta-Jones) scares her more than being on the run. Handsome South Korean star Byung Hun Lee brings fresh appealing energy to the ensemble as Han the ""best contract killer in the world"" hired to off Frank and Marvin. Not only is he lethal he bears a grudge.

The novelty of the first film was that it was an international thriller shoot em-up peopled by senior citizen movie stars.Many of them are back for more here including Bruce Willis as retired black ops CIA agent Frank Moses John Malkovich as his former sidekick Marvin and Helen Mirren as sharpshooter extraordinaire Victoria. Anthony Hopkins turns up as a renegade weapons scientist who may know the whereabouts of a portable nuclear device one of all too many MacGuffins in this mix.Mary-Louise Parker is Franks ditsy love interest and Catherine Zeta-Jones turns up as a Russian spy. Apparently nobody told her she should attempt a Russian accent. Korean martial arts movie star Byung-hun Lee as the ""worlds best contract killer"" has a nice scene in which he fends off an entire squadron of attackers in a convenience store while handcuffed to a glass display case. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time Its nice to see oldsters cavorting in kaboom movies but a little of this stuff goes a long way.

Cut ahead three years later when the Retired-Extremely-Dangerous espionage antics of ""RED"" leapt off the page and onto silver screens to become a sleeper hit. Skip ahead another three years and here we have it ""RED 2."" The gangs all back together sort of. Morgan Freemans rascally character is still deader than disco; sadly Ernest Borgnine has followed suit. Speaking of suits Karl Urban is nowhere to be found and most distinctly director Robert Schwentke has been replaced. Hes been too busy helming this weekends other comic adaptation starring Mary-Louise Parker (""R.I.P.D."") to handle this one but in lieu of a continuous comic-book flair being brought to the action Dean Parisot (""Fun with Dick and Jane"" the much better ""Galaxy Quest"") opts for literally hand-drawn transitions and tons of sloppy coverage punctuated by the occasional slo-mo shot. Im getting ahead of myself I suppose. Theres still Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) retired CIA man and loving boyfriend to Sarah (Parker) a dolt from the Midwest whos always eager to see some action. Theres still Marvin (John Malkovich) a basket case who knows that he and Frank have been falsely tied to a Cold War-era op by the name of ""Nightshade"" and Victoria (Helen Mirren) their old MI6 cohort who has agreed to take them out. Lastly theres still Ivan (Brian Cox) a Russian contact of fleeting importance who continues to carry a torch for dear Victoria. Forced to clear their names across the globe rather than just the States the gang flies to Paris where they hunt down a source named ""The Frog"" (David Thewlis) and bump into Russian counterintelligence operative -- and Franks old flame -- Katja (Catherine Zeta-Jones). In London original ""Nightshade"" architect Dr. Bailey (Anthony Hopkins Mirrens ""Hitchcock"" co-star of late) is sprung from an asylum and all the way to Moscow Frank and friends are pursued by two additional assassins Jack Horton (Neal McDonough) and Han Cho Bai (Byung-hun Lee). Sound busy? It is but dont worry -- the best agents in the world will still need to spell everything out twice over throughout their mission (but they shop at Costco and eat Papa Johns pizza so theyre just like us). Sound funny? It was when a spys stale love life and intertwining career concerns was the premise for ""True Lies"" nearly two decades ago. Sound exciting? If watching countless lackeys get gunned down with nary a splatter of blood is your cup of tea sure although Lee putting his martial-arts skills to good use in a cop-filled convenience store is admittedly a highlight. The novelty of the first film was that the old guys (and lady) could stick it to the youngsters but even that feels old hat now. Willis stepping cooly out of a spinning car has now become Willis stepping cooly into the drivers seat of another moving vehicle. Every double-cross every ticking clock every Malkovich mumble and bug-eyed Parker reaction shot is familiar in the worst ways; what was once engagingly silly is now much closer to insultingly dumb. ""RED 2"" is meant to be minimally memorable. Its made for catching at a matinee and then picking up at Redbox three months later when you honestly cant tell if youve seen it already then throwing onto Netflix while folding laundry or entertaining the in-laws. Its the kind of movie youd then find at Costco stacked between the other Bruce Willis one and that thing with Tom Cruise waiting for some bald lunatic to come and save you from your own mundane existence.

The original film based on the DC comic-book series had a casually chatty B-movie extravagance that was disarmingly friendly. The plot was just pulp to chew on but the characters made for lively company and I was happy at the prospect of spending more time with them. To say that RED 2 is a worthy follow-up is to say that its another piece of smartly preposterous action-espionage trash with a countdown-to-Armagedden caper plot thats a little too arbitrary and complicated for its own good. This time our heroes have to track a rogue nuke thats set to go off in the middle of Moscow; theyre also out to clear their names in a Cold War scandal that dates back to the early 80s. Even more than in the first film Bruce Willis chemistry with Mary-Louise Parker has a spiky charm and I enjoyed the killer charisma of Byung-hun Lee as a newly added assassin who can murder you with a piece of origami -- though hes a perfect example of a character whos in the mix because hes more colorful than essential. You could sum up the concept of RED 2 like RED before it as ""cleverly convoluted action comedy with excessively nonchalant one-liners"" or ""a coed version of The Expendables crossed with Oceans Fourteen."" But I prefer to think of the concept as ""violent throwaway thriller featuring a cast youd expect to see in a hip Broadway revival of Shakespeare."" The (mild) kick of RED 2 apart from its snazzy if overdone pile-up of action scenes big twists and MacGuffins is that it once again plugs actors like John Malkovich Helen Mirren and Anthony Hopkins into the kind of over-the-top ballistic carnage -- and invites them to express the sort of kick-ass attitude -- that youd normally expect to see in a Bruce Willis blowout. As the former black-ops CIA agent Frank Moses Willis once again gives the audience a full satisfying dose of his die-hard-for-a-paycheck moxie which means that Mirren (as a cold-blooded MI6 assassin) and Malkovich (as a black-ops agent who keeps getting very irritated) have to measure up to that Willis standard. And they do. The best thing about RED 2 like its predecessor is its lightness of tone. Too many movies with comic-book roots come on too seriously even when the comics themselves have a loose fast jocular wit about them. The action is light too Late in the movie when that nuke is ticking down and the helicopter on which Malkovich is attempting to dismantle it is going down I flashed back to the early Bond films where every calamity was averted with style. The limitation of a movie like this one -- the downside of its lightness -- is that its hard to pretend that theres really anything at stake. That is beyond the next drop-dead rejoinder in the face of disaster.

That means that this Retired and Extremely Dangerous former CIA agent is keeping a coolheadedly low profile with his wife Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) in between pantry-stocking trips to Costco (the first of many shameless product placements). But trouble comes calling when Franks scatterbrained partner Marvin (John Malkovich) informs him of a mysterious man-woman-object known as ""Nightshade"" that several superpowers are itching to get their hands on. Time to get the band back together for a little globehopping derring-do--everyone from old ""friends"" like stoic British sniper Victoria (Helen Mirren) and her sometime Russian lover Ivan (Brian Cox) to new faces like mad scientist Bailey (Anthony Hopkins) and sensuous Soviet assassin Katja (Catherine Zeta-Jones). Villains include vengeful Chinese martial artist Han (Byung-hun Lee) and bespectacled arms dealer the Frog (David Thewlis) though allegiances shift as frequently as this tiresome sequel whiplashes between old-folks-with-guns farce and soul-sappingly demoralizing violence. One moment Mirren and Cox are doing some delightful romantic canoodling while rescuing their imprisoned compatriots the next the Iranian embassy is being shot up with a stone-faced indifference that seems tone-deaf to real-world tensions and hostilities. (The satisfyingly satirical edge director Dean Parisot displayed in 1999s Galaxy Quest appears to have abandoned him.) As in the first film the seasoned-pro cast provides the few fleeting pleasures to be found. Its amazing how Parkers flighty insouciance or Malkovichs patented peculiarity (where else can we see this inimitable performer decked out in a Carmen Miranda fruit headdress?) makes us think if only for a moment that were truly enjoying ourselves.

Red 2 gathers together a collection of lauded thespians - from A(nthony Hopkins) to (Catherine) Z(eta-Jones) - and leaves them to float on a sea of action-flick cliches.The only one to keep his head above water is John Malkovich and thats because he clearly doesnt care about the material His character an ex-secret operative named Marvin with a fetish for bizarre headgear is an affable afterthought to the more square-jawed secret agent played by Bruce Willis. Multimedia Red 2 The official trailer Like The Expendables the Red series is ostensibly about veteran professionals who are still lethal weapons (the title is an acronym for ""Retired and Extremely Deadly) but the one-liners keep missing the target. (Its quite possible that Helen Mirren has never had to speak such terrible dialogue in her life.)Confusingly shot and edited to ribbons the action scenes are only barely more comprehensible than the plot which involves a stolen weapon of mass destruction.The characters run all around the world from Paris to Moscow to London trying to prevent a bomb from going off without realizing that theyre actually all in it.

But their movie? There Im afraid the acronym only stands for Recycled Expensive Dull. The first film in 2010 adapted a comic book -- and took a hint from Sly Stallones recently revived senior-citizen action career -- to feature Bruce Willis Helen Mirren John Malkovich and Morgan Freeman as old but still deadly spies. The actual story made very little sense but it did feature four old pros doing what they do best -- Mirren being droll Malkovich acting oddly Freeman waxing wise and Willis smirking and pretending to be sexual TNT. And that was enough for it to be a surprise hit. Which no surprise set us up for a sequel. Its minus Freeman this time but the other three are back -- still being droll odd and smirky/sexy as the script (and their paychecks) demand. And this time it adds a wizened Anthony Hopkins (and oddly orange Catherine Zeta Jones) too. Except none of it comes to much good. There are people out to kill them again and some sort of secret weapon being sought. Zeta Jones is a tricky Russian. Hopkins plays a dotty old scientist who seems to be locked away in one of Hannibal Lecters old rooms. Oh and Byung-hun Lee is in there too as a Korean assassin on Willis trail. And he adds absolutely nothing except an obvious bit of pandering to the overseas market where these big-on-bangs low-on-nuance Hollywood movies now make their real money. The script however is once again strictly a piece of hackwork and the direction has no real wit or inventiveness; its hard to believe the same filmmaker Dean Parisot once gave us the sublimely silly and knowing ""Galaxy Quest."" Potentially comic scenes -- a mysterious funeral a romantic evening between two suspicious ex-lovers -- go absolutely nowhere. The action scenes while relatively well-staged are all played absolutely straight. Malkovich at least is enjoying himself as the petulant slightly drug-addled Marvin; he makes some funny faces behind peoples backs and the sight of him stalking around with Willis like a couple of armed angrily bald babies is worth a brief smile. But a movie which continually resorts to putting its characters in purposely awful clothes to get a laugh is a movie which is coasting on fumes and the whole thing shudders to a stop long before the de rigueur tick-tick-tick ending of a bomb that needs to be defused. That sort of thing was old hat three decades and several Bonds ago way back in ""Octopussy"" days. By now? It just needs to be retired -- like these agents and definitely like this franchise. Ratings note The film contains violence drug references and strong language. Red 2 (PG-13) Summit (116 min.) Directed by Dean Parisot. With Bruce Willis Helen Mirren Anthony Hopkins.

(Photo Frank MasiSMPSP) By Stephanie Merry July 18 2013 Follow stephmerry ""Red"" the 2010 sleeper hit and graphic novel adaptation felt refreshing. Not only were the movies heroes all older than 50 but the action-comedy paid as much attention to the comedy as to the action and the result was effervescently fun. Sequels are for the most part inherently stale so its no shock the luster has faded in ""Red 2."" The bigger surprise is just how clunky and unsatisfying this follow-up feels. As the movie opens CIA retiree Frank (Bruce Willis) has returned to the quiet life shopping at Costco with his girlfriend Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker). As he attempts to embrace the joys of the burbs while searching for giant bags of shrimp shes despondent staring at an elderly couple wrangling a jumbo pack of toilet paper. She craves adventure. Luckily Franks quirky former partner the conspiracy theorist Marvin (John Malkovich) appears with a new plan in mind. The trio ends up traveling to Paris Moscow and London trying to discern the meaning of Operation Nightshade. Frank and Marvin have been accused of spearheading the deadly mission even though they know nothing about it. New enemies have cropped up to take the three heroes down including the worlds best contract killer Han (Byung-hun Lee) the sadistic Jack (Neal McDonough) and even their old friend Victoria (Helen Mirren). To spice things up Catherine Zeta-Jones materializes to play Katja Franks ex-paramour. And Anthony Hopkins shows up in the role of an institutionalized scientist who may be the key to the Nightshade puzzle. The plot is fairly busy given that it feels like an afterthought. The point of the movie is action and its all here shootouts car chases shootouts during car chases hand-to-hand combat helicopter crashes bomb explosions and death by paper crane (Han is talented in the art of lethal origami). While the action sequences in the first ""Red"" were impressive the banter elevated the movie giving it cross-generational appeal. Sarah and Frank had great chemistry Frank and Marvin exchanged amusing barbs Sarah and Victoria shared dating advice. There doesnt seem to be much attention paid to dialogue in ""Red 2."" Malkovich is funny when he speaks though he spends most of the film with a dumbfounded expression his mouth in the shape of a perfect O. Hopkins meanwhile mostly repeats the phrase ""jolly good"" over and over. But nowhere is the triviality of dialogue more evident than in the editing. There are numerous occasions when mouths and words are completely out of sync. In a similar vein while theres action to spare much of it looks computer-generated. Neither the first film nor this endeavor seek to represent reality which explains why no character can be contained by handcuffs and how Frank probably could take down 300 Spartans without a scratch. But at some point the dearth of believability becomes distracting. ""Red"" director Robert Schwentke didnt return for the sequel. (His latest ""R.I.P.D."" also comes out this weekend.) But ""Red 2"" director Dean Parisot can hardly be the only one to blame. ""Red 2"" is merely part of the Hollywood machine that takes any surprise hit and churns out a follow-up as quickly as possible. Unfortunately that means to quality along with anything that made ""Red"" special ends up like all of Franks adversaries collateral damage. 1/2 PG-13. At area theaters. Contains intense action sequences mostly bloodless violence language and drug references. 116 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Credit Frank Masi/Summit Entertainment The gag or one of three in Dean Parisots action-comedy sequel ""RED 2"" is that its killer oldsters are unflappable not because theyre too cool but because theyre seen-it-all semi-retirees. And after surviving the adventures of ""RED"" these comfortably recognizable agents and mercenaries are now doubly experienced and casual. Sociopathic assassins drop in like son of a guns and fusillades of bullets come and go like passing showers but Bruce Willis John Malkovich and Helen Mirren will still trade relationship advice and in-jokes like old friends on a package tour.All that nonchalance (minus the strenuous panache of an ""Oceans Eleven"") is hard to get excited about but having actors who can put the slightest topspin on their volleys still helps along with some mild female rivalry to flavor the low-impact shootouts and routine double crosses. Frank (Mr. Willis) is still ""retired and extremely dangerous"" per the title and he is pulled out of quiet domesticity with his civilian sweetheart Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker). Together with their deadly buddy Marvin (Mr. Malkovich) they dive into a secret international crisis with nuclear stakes.But what pops more than the gunfire are the line readings where Ms. Parker especially but also Mr. Malkovich and Ms. Mirren can give personality to standard action repartee. Rest assured (and you may well rest a bit) theres also a mad genius (Anthony Hopkins bringing half-dotty British understatement to the party); a jet-setting whippersnapper (Byung-hun Lee best when fighting); and Franks Russian old flame (Catherine Zeta-Jones).Cars careen lazily written infiltration plans are executed and the violence is plentiful and toothless. You can tell the villain has been revealed when hes the only one who really cares about murder.""RED 2"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Former killers bloodlessly taking care of business -- nothing to be alarmed about.

"Review In Red 2 aging spies return for more AARP-style havoc - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review In Red 2 aging spies return for more AARP-style havoc ""Red 2"" Frank Masi / Summit Entertainment Helen Mirren stars as an assassin in ""Red 2."" Helen Mirren stars as an assassin in ""Red 2."" (Frank Masi / Summit Entertainment) Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic The new action spy thriller ""Red 2"" starring Bruce Willis John Malkovich Mary-Louise Parker and Helen Mirren opens at a Costco. The only action at the moment is a shopping cart with a bum wheel. A heated discussion about backyard grills and power sprays is underway. Until a box a bomb and an old spy on Aisle 3 threaten to upset this banal scene.Its official the retired and extremely dangerous -- a.k.a. RED -- crew of aging international spies is back for another round of AARP-style havoc. Which means the world will be a safer place -- eventually -- and youngsters that would be anyone under 40 will learn to respect their elders or pay for it. What was a minor gag in 2010s ""Red"" has become a major thread in ""Red 2"" with the issues of aging and retirement front and center. Even the movies central intrigues -- a long lost weapon of mass destruction and the brilliant scientist who created it -- are old. Thank you Anthony Hopkins for showing how delightfully devious a villain with memory loss can be.PHOTOS Billion dollar box office club Screenwriting brothers Jon and Erich Hoeber are back for Round 2 as well but directing duties have shifted to Dean Parisot. No doubt the hope was that Parisot could do to the action genre what he did to the ""Star Trek"" universe in the spot-on satire of 1999s ""Galaxy Quest."" He has and he hasnt. ""Red 2"" is much more of a mixed bag than it should have been.But back to Costco. The legendary Frank Moses (Willis) determined to stay retired this time is commandeering the cart. He doesnt want Sarah (Parker) the girl he fell for over the phone in ""Red"" to get caught in any more crossfire. She on the other hand is dying for more time in the spy game.In a very good move Malkovichs role as electronics-wizard Marvin and his spy-jinx have been ratcheted up while his crazy has been toned down. Now hes more of a smart insistent noodge and the movie is better for it. In fact if everyone delivered their lines with the rat-a-tat-tat precision of Malkovich Mirren and Hopkins the studio might have had a better movie on its hands.Meanwhile crazy and old has been reserved for Bailey (Hopkins) a scientist the Brits locked up as a mental case 32 years ago. CIA interest in an old covert operation called Nightshade has resurfaced. Somehow Frank and Marvin factor in which once again makes them targets. Its complicated and the movie spends far too much time trying to explain. Suffice it to say that in short order there is an ever widening circle of sharpshooters looking to take them out including old friend Victoria (Mirren) that classy British assassin whose romance on the run with Russian master-spy Ivan (Brian Cox) continues to sizzle.PHOTOS Summer Sneaks 2013 The movie does not pull back on the action front -- in fact the run and gun scenes are endless. Agent Jack Horton (Neal McDonough always a good bad guy) is in charge of the CIA dirty work and newcomer Han (Byung Hun Lee) brings martial arts action to the mix as he decides whether to settle an old grudge against Frank or throw in with him.But if anything the sequel is more focused on romance.Sarah and Frank are working through relationship issues already when Catherine Zeta-Jones turns up as Katja Franks sultry ex. Katjas big dilemma is whether to shoot Frank or seduce him while Sarahs is whether to shoot or strangle her.Although the romance between Victoria and Ivan heats things up the one between Sarah and Frank tends to cool things down. Some of the cute-factor of the first -- he kidnapped her to save her -- has been lost now that theyre a couple. Sparks do fly on occasion mostly when Sarah uses her biggest undercover asset -- a kiss that can apparently melt the heart of any villain in any country. It makes Frank crazy jealous. But for the most part hes just so mellow and Willis inherent charm goes only so far.The ""thing"" the world needs saving from besides another bad romance is that mysterious weapon Bailey made. To get Bailey out of lock-up and to recover the bomb before it gets into the wrong hands is what keeps everyone on the move. Still for all the pyrotechnics you never believe that love the world or the senior spies are in any real danger.Follow BetsySharkey on Twitter and on Google+-----------------------------------Red 2MPAA rating PG-13 for pervasive action and violence including frenetic gunplay and for some language and drug materialRunning time 1 hour 56 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Red 2 (movie) Bruce Willis John Malkovich Anthony Hopkins Helen Mirren Red 2 looks to an older audience for box-office action Hollwood Walk of Fame Bruce Willis Review Old-school The Conjuring has thrills gotchas aplenty Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad83deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-red-2-20130719,0,3735589.story",200,red215,red2,latimes

Better dead than ""RED 2."" Bruce Willis doing a nightclub comics impression of Bruce Willis is back as Frank an ex-CIA assassin who is (as we learned in a peek at his classified file in the original much livelier and funnier 2010 film) considered Retired Extremely Dangerous. This time he and John Malkovichs wacky sidekick Marvin learn that a Web site has leaked their names as being responsible for Project Nightshade -- the placement of a nuclear weapon in Moscow in 1979. Off we go on a round-the-world jaunt to solve the mystery of what happened to the rogue nuke to clear Franks name and to see what Malkovich looks like in funny hats. At one point he puts a bowl of fruit on his head. Guys Jerry Lewis just called to say your shtick is tired. Another top American spook (Neal McDonough) decides he needs to capture Frank and torture him for more details. But he blows that off and tries to just kill Frank out of spite. Franks girl Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) interjects with whiny-girl complaints (whyyyy she wonders cant she ever do professional hit-man stuff? Not that she is one) and goes shopping in designer stores when Frank has been drugged. Its like James Bond having to drag around Carrie Bradshaw. Also she keeps reminding Frank that the two of them need to work on their relationship usually when bullets are flying. And I do mean fly They soar like hawks or eagles always comfortably over Frank and Marvins heads while they keep bantering. Really the movie would be over if one of the hundreds of disposable assassins who line up to present their butts for kicking would just bend down and fire at the boys while they duck. Or if any hit squad would just assign one summer intern to keep a lookout behind to make sure no one shoots them in the back while theyre licking their chops about finally killing Frank. Whats most horrible is the violence directed at innocent scenery. At one point a snitch and wine snob called the Frog (David Thewlis appearing to his everlasting shame) has Frank and Sarah directly in front of him at a cafe in Paris but instead he fires at the ceiling. Since the Frog can as we have been told be bought off with a nice bottle of wine why the elaborately dull chase scene up and down the Seine? And why is Catherine Zeta-Jones playing a Russian ex-girlfriend of Franks? As for Helen Mirren -- not unalluring in a long fur coat stuffed with automatic weapons -- why would her character a British government assassin keep dead bodies around her home? Mark it down to UK austerity policies I guess but youd think MI6 wouldnt leave its best killers to dispose of bodies by pouring lye on them in their bathtubs. Mirren (despite a regrettable scene in which she spoofs her habit of playing queens) does slightly less mugging than the Americans which is a relief and Anthony Hopkins manages at least not to be too annoying as the scientist who designed Nightshade and is now for a super-genius surprisingly lax about keeping track of his prize creation. ""Red 2"" is a movie featuring actors in their 60s and lame one-liners from the 80s aimed at I.Q.s in the 70s. It isnt good it doesnt pretend to be good it isnt trying to be good. Its just a mass-produced industrial product like the half-digestible salisbury steak TV dinner its made to be half-watched in front of.

Grade C- In the original ""Red"" the secret weapon of its heroes - and the movie - was experience. Just as ex-CIA man Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) galvanized black-ops veterans to uncover a foul plot that led to Americas highest corridors of power the director Robert Schwentke inspired the entire cast including Helen Mirren and John Malkovich to use their well-honed wit to bring personality and flavor to the movie. In ""Red 2"" Moses team acts more reckless and arbitrary than wise and seasoned and the actors lose their intimate loopy rhythms. The movie tries to duplicate the appeal and formula of the first film only to achieve a clumsy mimicry. The focus of the plot is an international threat that brings the heroes to Paris Moscow and London instead of Chicago and New Orleans. (The segues are done with comic-book frames instead of ""Reds"" picture postcards.) Here the series comical surprises which derived from retired agents revving up are supposed to come from Franks desire to protect his civilian lover Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) and her desire to see some action. At the start Sarah worries that she and Frank might end up as one more aging couple fumbling among the shelves at Costco. Almost immediately Franks best friend Marvin Boggs (Malkovich) rescues them from creeping boredom with word that he and Frank have been targeted for death. The reason? A document leaked to Wikileaks has linked them to a once-secret and extremely nasty Cold War operation. Soon that elegant sharpshooter Victoria (Helen Mirren) and a virtuoso contract killer named Han (Byung-hun Lee) have accepted assignments to hunt them down. (Dont worry In this series allegiances are always subject to change.) At the center of the espionage is a mad scientist of destruction (Anthony Hopkins) and his breakthrough bomb. The director Dean Parisot proved in ""Galaxy Quest"" that he knew how to satirize an action genre while still building empathy and momentum. In ""Red 2"" hes temporarily lost his touch. Under his guidance the actors just do broader versions of established quirks. You wish that Parkers Sarah would give her wide-eyed delight and her crinkly expressions of worry and jealousy a rest. Even Malkovichs goofy flamboyance grows tiresome. Willis fares better - after all Franks an unflappable can-do guy - until the entrance of a gorgeous Russian agent named Katya (Catherine Zeta-Jones). Shes described as ""Franks Kryptonite"" but through no fault of Zeta-Jones the character becomes the movies Kryptonite. Of all the unfunny moments in this film the unfunniest are Katyas attempts to re-strike their old spark and her dismissals of Sarah as a romantic rival. The best byplay comes when Brian Cox returns as an affable amorous Russian agent named Ivan who marvels at Victorias prowess. Cox and Mirren connect sensually more than Willis does with either of his ladies. In the first film Mirrens Martha Stewart-based assassin really was a comic dream of elegance - a hit-woman who brought the same standards of taste and craft to homemaking high-caliber rifles and haute couture. Thats still the idea but this time the black-comic strokes in Jon and Erich Hoebers script are obvious and clunky. For example they highlight Victorias suave comportment while she pours acid into a bathtub to dissolve a corpse. Even thats chic compared to the scenes of Frank and Marvin slapping men around while Sarah wonders how she can become more like them. Director Parisot drops the balls in this juggling act. He doesnt stylize the action with comic-book boldness so that were able to thrill to it and laugh at it. The fights and chases are neither breezy nor irresistibly kinetic - most of the time theyre simply brutal. The exceptions are thanks to the Korean star Lee who makes efficiency charismatic (especially when he wields a piece of origami). ""Red"" you may recall stands for ""Retired Extremely Dangerous."" ""Red 2"" is more like ""Remake Exceptionally Dumb.""

More about Red 2 >> Not much has changed since the 2010 original Frank (Bruce Willis) the retired super-spy has once again slipped into a world of wimpy domesticity. ""Want to go look at the window treatments?"" he excitedly asks Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) his former hostage now housemate. Then another old mission of Franks explodes. The particulars are both ridiculously complicated and totally inconsequential this time too. The important thing is that every government agency and freelance assassin on the planet is now avidly stalking Frank. Hell need the help of those geriatric gunmen Marvin (John Malkovich) and Victoria (Helen Mirren) not only to survive but also to break into a series of impregnable redoubts including this time the Kremlin. The Red franchise has been turned over to TV director Dean Parisot who gives the sequel a quicker start and a warmer burnish while referencing the storys tenuous comic-book roots. He doesnt put a lot of effort however into making the stunt doubles convincing. That seems to be a dying art in Hollywood anyway. While Red spread its merry mayhem up and down Route 66 Red 2 has a distinctly European flavor spraying shell casings across the continents major capitals. Willis and Malkovich have settled into an easy and enjoyable rapport (although its odd how Marvin has gone from being a paranoid psycho recluse to a chatty sensible relationship expert). The additions to the cast - Catherine Zeta-Jones and Sir Anthony Hopkins - overplay their hands not recognizing how exceedingly nonchalant the tone of this farce is. Is it cynical to suggest Korean action star Byung-hun Lee has been recruited to lure a bigger Asian audience for Red 2? Its hard to imagine another explanation for his excessive screen time as ""the da Vinci of Death."" When not inane the movies trademark mix of gunplay and gags (""Why is it terrorists never appreciate Burgundy?"") is undeniably engaging. But in its long punishing final act Red 2 goes beyond its mandate as a lark to pose as a true action caper. It should make for a rousing finish but by that time enemies and allies have changed sides so many times so randomly that youre not sure whos fighting whom or why. You just know they all look a little old to be engaged in this sort of reckless behavior. Red 2 1/2 (out of four stars) Directed by Dean Parisot. With Bruce Willis Mary-Louise Parker John Malkovich and Helen Mirren. Distributed by Summit Entertainment. Running time 1 hour 56 mins.

The two are spending a dull day at Costco when they bump into ex-agent Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich) who is fond of feigning his demise.The first half-hour is less a reintroduction than a setup for a flimsy premise Our graying agents must beat villains hit men and government agents to ""Nightshade"" a Cold War weapon of unimaginable destruction. Directed by Dean Parisot (Galaxy Quest Fun With Dick and Jane) Red 2 is in such a rush to get the characters into a globe-trotting chase that it doesnt take the time even by sequel standards to flesh out its heroes.Instead theyre thrust into madcap vignettes. Want to break into the Kremlin? Just throw on some collar patches and crack a hole in the wall of a pizzeria bathroom next door. Need inside an insane asylum? Put Mirren in a crown and have her pretend to be the queen of England.That last scene though is what makes Red 2 palatable popcorn fare. It could have been wince-inducing but Mirren clearly is having fun parodying her more serious characters.Similarly the cast seems to genuinely enjoy the age-busting material as well as working with each other. Parker and Catherine Zeta-Jones in particular are terrific as competing women who know how to break a heart as well as a nose.It all nearly comes undone in the third act as our heroes and antagonists engage in increasingly ludicrous combat scenes.But credit Willis and Malkovich for keeping a grinning game face throughout. The two have the good-natured chemistry of buddy cops who have seen their share of doughnut shops. They may qualify for the senior discount movie ticket but when it comes to action films they still have one in the chamber. 100 CONNECTTWEET 2 LINKEDIN 15 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/12LALUK",http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~r/UsatodaycomMovies-TopStories/~3/kSYA7Kli4Qw/,200,red219,red2,usatoday

Pictures By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Updated July 19 2013 754 a.m. ET Things dont just go bump in the night in ""The Conjuring."" They go BUMP and then THUMP and then THUMP THUMP THUMP or SQUEAK BUMP or GROAN BANG. This saga of demonic possession deploys the full audio firepower of modern multiplexes and does so with brain-battering frequency like a ghostbusting version of a Japanese Taiko drum ensemble. The film is entirely irony-free and enjoyable up to a point for its straight-faced borrowings from ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Amityville Horror."" (A notable plus is the absence of vomit or at least green vomit; a brief spasm of standard upchuck is integral to the plot.) Apart from repetitive sound effects however little or nothing happens for long and boring stretches until all Hades finally breaks loose and an exorcism starts to look like the best medicine for an eerily familiar outbreak of evil. A full demonic procession hits theatres this weekend in the new film The Conjuring. There are few less than stellar ideas at work here says WSJ film critic Joe Morgenstern. Watch a clip from the film ""The Conjuring."" Paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren work to help a family terrorized by a dark presence in their farmhouse. Starring Vera Farmiga Ron Livingston and Lili Taylor. (Photo/Video New Line Cinema) The film was directed by James Wan working from a script by Chad Hayes and Carey Hayes and nicely photographed by John R. Leonetti; Joseph Bishara did the original music. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga play fictional versions of Ed and Lorraine Warren. You may remember the Warrens as respectively the self-declared demonologist and the clairvoyant who gained national celebrity for peddling solemn nonsense about the Amityville Horror case among others--for playing fictional versions of themselves. Mr. Wilsons performance is so bland that it could almost pass for parody. Ms. Farmigas expressions of empathy and concern are so eloquent that Lorraines worry lines become the equivalent of beauty marks. The clairvoyants pained concern is prompted by the haunting of an old farmhouse newly occupied by Carolyn and Roger Perron ( Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston) and their five daughters one of whom is played--extremely well--by Mackenzie Foy a 12-year-old veteran of the ""Twilight"" series in which she was cast as Renesmee the daughter of Bella and Edward. The time is 1971 a couple of years before the release of ""The Exorcist"" but the demonic spirits afflicting the Perrons know exactly the same tricks that will blight the life of Linda Blairs Regan. The big difference is that ""The Exorcist"" took the nation by storm with fresh ideas and brilliant filmmaking. ""The Conjuring"" conjures with amped-up echoes of old ideas and represents a bet that they still retain their creepy appeal for todays audience. ENLARGE The orca Tilikum in Blackfish. Magnolia Pictures Blackfish At the center of a swirl of claims and counterclaims in this enthralling documentary stands a chilling fact. An experienced trainer at Floridas SeaWorld Dawn Brancheau was killed three years ago by a killer whale named Tilikum that had killed two people before her. Gabriela Cowperthwaites film makes a persuasive case against the park which rejects all of the charges and denies all suggestions of negligence. More persuasively still ""Blackfish""--an Indian name for orcas--argues against the very concept of quasiamusement parks like SeaWorld that turn giant creatures meant for the wild into hemmed-in penned-up entertainers. Watch a clip from the film ""Blackfish"" a documentary that shows the sometimes devastating consequences of keeping killer whales in captivity. (Photo/Video Magnolia Pictures) The particulars of the case are deeply disturbing and include assertions that Tilikum had been notorious for aggressive behavior against humans. Former trainers interviewed for the film tell similar stories that they knew nothing of Tilikums notoriety or of scores of accidents with other orcas that preceded their hiring; that theyd been trained in their turn to regale park guests with information that was scientifically dubious or outright false; and that appalled by systematic mistreatment of the performing whales they kept their jobs mainly to protect creatures theyd come to love. (A caveat is in order video footage of two accidents is horrifying.) For those of us whove been to these parks as spectators theres a lingering temptation to think of large marine mammals as lovable or at least companionable if not downright cute. (A pilot whale in the petting tank of a long-gone park called Marineland of the Pacific once swallowed a new pair of Ray-Bans that had slipped off my sweaty nose. When the whale spit them out moments later an attendant netted them up undamaged except for a tiny tooth mark on the left lens.) After watching ""Blackfish"" you come away with a sense of orcas singular intelligence to be sure even their astonishing playfulness but most of all their glorious power and the majesty of their existence in their natural habitat. ENLARGE Ryan Gosling Radius-TWC Only God Forgives Nicolas Winding Refns excruciatingly--though definitively--pretentious exercise in ritual violence gives chiaroscuro a bad name. All those murky explorations of half-lighted corridors and gloomy rooms all those darksome exteriors with shadowy figures walking in slo-mo while the drama stalls in no-mo. ""Only God Forgives"" would seem to be a parody of something or other--""Blue Velvet""? ""Last Year At Marienbad""?--except that the film takes itself seriously to the point of suffocation in telling its lurid tale of slaughter and revenge. Watch a clip from the film ""Only God Forgives."" A Bangkok drug smuggler (Ryan Gosling) sees his life get complicated when his mother (Kristin Scott Thomas) compels him to find whoever is responsible for his brothers death. (Photo/Video RADiUS-TWC) Ryan Gosling so mesmerizing in Mr. Refns 2011 film ""Drive"" has a starring role that defines thanklessness. He plays the impassive inert and evidently impotent Julian who with his brother Billy manages a Bangkok boxing club that serves their family as a front for a drug-smuggling operation. When Billy is murdered the familys grotesque and profane matriarch Crystal ( Kristin Scott Thomas; go figure) arrives from London to claim her sons body and to remind the immobilized Julian that its up to him to avenge Billys death though thats like saying its up to the manhole cover to clean out the sewer. The least savory character in this spoiled stewed is a sadistic cop Chang (Vithaya Pansringarm) who likes to sing in nightclubs when he isnt lopping off limbs with his trusty sword. ""Only God Forgives"" is not without its absurdist rewards however especially when its making points about Julians castrating mom who always favored his brother. Informed by Julian that Billy was murdered for raping and killing a 16-year-old girl Crystal replies ""Im sure he had his reasons."" Whats a mother for? ENLARGE Helen Mirren Summit Entertainment Red 2 Any movie that gives Helen Mirren a chance to shoot really big guns wear an ermine astrakhan and channel Bette Davis as Queen Elizabeth cant be all bad and ""Red 2"" isnt though it comes close. Its a sequel to the 2010 action adventure that starred Bruce Willis John Malkovich Morgan Freeman Mary-Louise Parker and Ms. Mirren in a buoyant tale of ex-CIA operatives returned at a fairly advanced age to thunderous action. An inevitable sequel because the previous film was an unexpected hit so there was no way to leave well enough alone. Even allowing for the usual decay rate in the process though ""Red 2"" gets woefully monotonous unless you have a high tolerance for spasms of generic action interspersed with winks nods and smirks. Watch a clip from the film ""Red 2."" Retired black-ops CIA agent Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) reunites his unlikely team of elite operatives for a global quest to track down a missing portable nuclear device. (Photo/Video Summit Entertainment) Mr. Williss Frank Moses is still the leader of the ragtag crew of good guys and Mr. Malkovichs Marvin still wears the fixed expression of someone who has chomped on an underripe persimmon. (He also wears an overripe Carmen Miranda headdress at the end.) A few changes have been made to the lineup however. Mr. Freeman is out and sorely missed. Anthony Hopkins and Catherine Zeta-Jones are in; hes a villain shes an eyeful and thats not being sexist just reporting the facts. Dean Parisot directed from a script by Jon Hoeber and Erich Hoeber that fits standard elements of the genre together like well-worn Lego blocks. They include an exotic car a funny car a chopper a Learjet fine wine (Chateau Yquem if youre wondering) knife-throwing Tasering the most powerful nerve agent ever created and blowfish poison (theyre not synonymous). Whats at stake is the lives of countless millions of people since a hidden nuclear weapon is set to go off and finding it requires the heroic geriatrics to visit Paris London and Moscow. It wont spoil anything if I say that countless millions dont die although the death toll of bad guys is huge. Enrique Chediaks vibrant cinematography makes the whole silly thing look almost meaningful. Rewind ENLARGE The Eclipse The Eclipse (2009) Everyone is haunted by something in Conor McPhersons beguilingly leisurely ""The Eclipse"" set in contemporary Ireland. Ciaran Hinds is Michael a woodwork teacher occasional writer and single father. Haunted by the loss of his wife Michael suffers from apparitions that blight his fitful sleep. Iben Hjejle is Lena a writer who writes ghost stories because she was haunted by an apparition when she was a young girl visiting Italy. Aidan Quinn is Nicholas a best-selling hack novelist who is haunted not by his insufferable self-importance but by the fully justified sense of inadequacy that underlies it. ENLARGE Rust and Bone Rust and Bone (2012) Marion Cotillards Steph loses both legs above the knees in a terrible accident at the French marine park where she was working as an orca trainer. Matthias Schoenaerts is Ali a single father and chronic loser. Hes splendid in the role a sort of noble--though often ignoble--savage who might be civilized by the right woman in the right circumstances. (At times he may remind you of Ryan Gosling.) Shes always splendid a star of seemingly effortless distinction. Jacques Audiard directed from a screenplay he adapted with Thomas Bidegain from a story by Craig Davidson. ENLARGE Galaxy Quest Galaxy Quest (1999) Dean Parisot directed this peerless sci-fi parody which turns on a cosmic joke. A desperate band of Thermians the last survivors of a distant planet come to Earth seeking help from the washed-up actors of a worn-out television series called ""Galaxy Quest"" (read ""Star Trek""). Theyve been watching the series from its inception and have mistaken the tacky episodes for historical texts. The screenplay--a sacred text for lovers of comedy--was written by David Howard and Robert Gordon. The cast includes Tim Allen Sigourney Weaver Alan Rickman Tony Shalhoub Sam Rockwell and Daryl Mitchell.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The aging agents known as ""Retired Extremely Dangerous"" reunite to stop a doomsday plot. Rated PG-13 (for violence language drug references) BOTTOM LINE The senior stars of the 2010 action-comedy ""RED"" are still going strong in this enjoyably breezy sequel. CAST Bruce Willis Helen Mirren John Malkovich Mary-Louise Parker LENGTH 156 Back in late 2010 the action-comedy ""RED"" grew into a sleeper hit. Starring Bruce Willis John Malkovich and Helen Mirren as over-the-hill secret agents pulled back into action ""RED"" -- an acronym for Retired Extremely Dangerous -- became the rare ""senior"" movie to appeal to a wider audience. Its 200 million worldwide gross is something that sweeter gooier movies like ""Quartet"" and ""Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" couldnt quite manage. The overarching joke of ""RED"" was that these twinkly-eyed oldsters were actually cold-blooded killers. Willis as black ops veteran Frank Moses could still dispatch paramilitary goons single-handedly; Mirren as MI6 sharpshooter Victoria stashed a machine gun in her floral arrangements. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Fast-paced and slightly black-humored ""RED"" was breezy fun with an exceptional cast that included a comparatively young Mary-Louise Parker (shes now 48) as Sarah Ross a sassy civilian accidentally dragged into Franks latest mess. ""RED 2"" in which Franks new romance with Sarah is interrupted by news of a doomsday plot hews closely to the original films formula. (Brothers Jon and Erich Hoeber return as screenwriters while fledgling director Dean Parisot seamlessly replaces Robert Schwentke.) Mirren is back as are Malkovich as the LSD-addled savant Marvin Boggs and the wonderful Brian Cox as the hardy Soviet spy Ivan. New additions include Catherine Zeta-Jones as the temptress Katja Anthony Hopkins (in a slightly uneven performance) as mad scientist Edward Bailey and an appealing Byung Hun Lee (the ""G.I. Joe"" films) as martial-arts maestro Han. The threadbare story -- a bomb made of ""red mercury"" lies hidden in Russia but its those new screen villains the Iranians who want it -- is a pleasant excuse for elaborate action sequences and mid-shootout wisecracks in picturesque locales like London and Paris. 149 MoviesRed 2 trailer Theres one difference The old-folks jokes have largely disappeared. That makes ""RED 2"" feel a little less fresh but the characters (taken from the 2003 comic-book series) remain strong and the actors still sparkle. Mirren in particular handles more action here and the 67-year-old dame looks darn good firing double-fisted pistols in slow motion. ""RED 2"" stands quite sturdily on its own as a caper comedy whose stars just happen to be approaching 50 60 and even 70 years old. advertisement | advertise on newsday PLOT The aging agents known as ""Retired Extremely Dangerous"" reunite to stop a doomsday plot.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert Stupidity isnt a virtue but it can be amusing sometimes even endearing. How else to explain my fondness for ""Red 2"" an action comedy delivering dumb fun by the ton? Its utter drivel coasting by on slick proficiency (at 100 miles an hour). As anyone who saw this films 2010 predecessor knows the bar of expectation here hasnt been raised above sixth-grade height. This is simply a planes-pistols-and-passports time-killer slapped together with a goodhearted kind of sloppy naivete. The production features a constellation of superb actors whaling away at stuntmen with automatic weapons generating the sort of apocalyptic slapstick Moe Larry and Curly would create if they had access to bazookas. Yet the movie manages to keep theatergoers if not in stitches at least not in need of safety pins to keep their eyes open. ""Red 2"" wheels out aging-but-still-agile Bruce Willis for a second spin as Frank Moses a retired CIA black-ops man determined to build a safe risk-free life with his winsome girlfriend. Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) is bored silly sleepwalking the aisles at Costco; she wants Frank to play the rugged hero. Be careful what you wish for. The couple soon find themselves targets of a high-tech manhunt by INTERPOL and the Russian and American governments with a freelance assassin (Korean star Byung Hun Lee) chasing them to boot. Now its up to them to save the world or get really bruised trying. The plot is a rickety scaffold for a series of car chases sniper fire and boot-to-head combat along with the obligatory smooch scene. This is a film where all you need to break into the Kremlin is a sledgehammer and a Russian Army Halloween costume. The intrigue is not exactly credible but it keeps our interest in who did what to whom and whether theyll get away with it. Even if you dont believe Secret Agent Bruce could kill anything stronger than a six-pack of Bud Light you still want go along for the ride and see what happens next. JAN THIJS 2013 Summit Entertainment LLC. All rights reserved. Mary-Louise Parker Bruce Willis center and John Malkovich return to spy business and high jinks in ""Red 2."" Helen Mirren knee-meltingly gorgeous at 67 returns as MI6 retiree Victoria with lethal skills as sharp as her loyalties are ambiguous. John Malkovich again plays Franks trigger-happy spy partner Marvin whose antics Willis regards with the confounded expression of a man peering under the hood of his car. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Katja a Russian agent who was once Franks lover. And Anthony Hopkins plays addled British scientist Edward Bailey who is the key to locating a U.S. doomsday weapon hidden somewhere in Moscow. With his tweeds striped school scarf and absent-minded eccentricity Hopkins seems like one of Harry Potters dotty schoolmasters who wandered off the Hogwarts campus. The ace cast isnt an extravagance but a necessity. They con us into ignoring preposterous contrivances and make dimwitted dialogue sparkle like Champagne. When Willis barks at Malkovich for giving the untrained Parker a gun he chidingly retorts ""This is AMERICA Frank."" The substance of ""Red 2"" is not superior. Its sales technique is breathtaking. Colin Covert has covered films for the Star Tribune for 20 years interviewing Peter Jackson Kate Winslet Steven Spielberg Cate Blanchett Quentin Tarantino Neil Gaiman and John Travolta to name a few. Colins job as a film critic consists mostly of thinking up synonyms for ""mediocre."" He still gets a thrill when the lights dim and all too often a bigger thrill when they come on again.

"Red 2 2.5 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article Red 2 2.5 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED INFO Director Dean Parisot.Cast Bruce Willis John Malkovich Helen Mirren.Rating PG-13 for pervasive action and violence including frenetic gunplay and for some language and drug material. RELATED NEWS Elder hot actors Female Elder hot actors Male By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Jul 18 2013 1023 AM There is a fine line between silly dumb fun and out-and-out stupidity and ""Red 2"" crosses it one time too many. Two times. Three four whatever I lost count. Granted if youre making a (second) movie about aging retired assassins and secret agents getting called back into the game some suspension of disbelief is required if youre going to get through it at all. But at some point Dean Parisots film which stars Bruce Willis Helen Mirren and John Malkovich just gets ridiculous. Parisot took over for Robert Schwentke who directed the 2010 hit with much of the same cast and managed to rein in the silliness for the most part. Sure there was some nutty behavior and craziness because both films are based on a comic book. But nothing to make you stop in the middle and say ""Well that couldnt happen."" Because some little-kid part of your brain is trying to tell you ""Yes it could. Maybe."" Not this time. Since last we saw them Frank (Willis) the retired CIA black-ops agent is telling himself hes happy living a domestic life with Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker). She doesnt even pretend. Shes had a taste of the spy life and wants more to Franks worry. The paranoid acid casualty Marvin (Malkovich) pays a visit in his own inimitable way to tell them something big is cooking. And hes right. Through several plot machinations we learn that Frank and Marvin unwittingly helped smuggle a deadly weapon code-named Nightshade into the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Now everyone is after it good guys and bad -- and after Frank Marvin and Sarah too. This leads to a lot of globe-trotting and explosions and increasingly implausible escapes and shoot-em-ups. Like the quips between the good guys and bad guys its fun for a while but gets old pretty fast. One thing that doesnt get old is Parker. She all but stole the first movie. The context is a little different now since shes no longer necessarily terrified by all the gunplay and whatnot -- in fact she craves it (so she thinks) -- but the filmmakers wisely rely heavily on her comic timing for many of the laughs. Ruthless cheery killer Victoria (Mirren) is on hand again as is Ivan (Brian Cox). Additions include Katja (Catherine Zeta-Jones) a Russian spy and former lover of Franks; Han Cho Bai (Byung-hun Lee) a particularly effective contract killer; Jack Horton (Neal McDonough) the dependably greasy government agent; and Bailey (Anthony Hopkins) an addled scientist. Whats missing this time around (in addition to Morgan Freeman) is the first films playful examination of aging. Sure these folks were still lethal we saw then but things took a little longer. They had to work a little harder to kill people. In the sequel they might as well be 25 so invincible are they. Too bad. Its not that it isnt funny to see Mirren dissolve bodies in a tub filled with acid while in formal wear and chatting on the phone. Its that wed like to see her and the rest of the gang do something more too. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

"Red 2 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; red-2 ) Red 2 (United States 2013) July 18 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Im not sure whose idea it was to turn Red into a movie franchise. The first film based on the DC Comics graphic novel was an enjoyable throw-away but there was nothing about the movie or its modest box office success that cried out for a second installment. The existence of Red 2 is therefore something of a surprise; sitting through it is nowhere near as enjoyable as the experience of watching its predecessor. Much of what felt fresh and fun in Red has turned stale in the sequel and it doesnt help that the storyline a James Bond rip-off/satire is written at a level where sixth graders would be able to point out some obvious and irritating narrative flaws. One doesnt expect to see Helen Mirren Anthony Hopkins and John Malkovich mired in such a stupid plot. The movie reunites the group of AARP superspies we first encountered in 2010s Red (with the notable exceptions of Morgan Freeman whose character died and Ernest Borgnine). So we have retired kick-ass specialist Frank Moses (Bruce Willis); his best buddy Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich); his girlfriend Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker); and his ex-MI6 compatriot Victoria (Helen Mirren). Joining them are three notable newcomers sexy Russian military officer Katja (Catherine Zeta-Jones) confused diabolical scientist Edward Bailey (Anthony Hopkins) and the worlds best contract killer Han Cho Bai (Byung-hun Lee). Theyre all thrown together into a mix that has them moving from one country to the next about every five minutes with a somewhat unremarkable payoff that involves keeping a suitcase nuclear bomb from blowing up. The storyline gets a lot of mileage out of being confusing because the lack of coherence distracts viewers from realizing how moronic the whole thing is. The ending is a perfect example the big ""trick"" is so obvious its impossible to accept that the super-smart bad guy didnt figure it out. (He even quips ""I didnt see that coming."") Much earlier a faked death is so well executed that the filmmakers feel no need to explain how the ""fakery"" is accomplished. The reason is obvious theres no way any explanation would be remotely plausible. So they dont bother to explain it. Thats just lazy screenwriting. Give the audience some credit for intelligence. Is that asking too much? The action scenes in Red 2 are a weird amalgamation of old-school stuff and Fast amp; Furious over-the-top physics-defying material. Theres more of the former than the latter (largely I assume for budgetary reasons) although theres a significant helicopter crash from which two characters emerge unscathed. Those in search of an adrenaline rush wont find it here. The gunplay chases and fight scenes are choreographed with a PG-13 sensibility which means theyre mechanical largely bloodless and not especially exciting. Its possible to tell that director Dean Parisot has been spending a lot of time in television lately (it has been nine years since his last theatrical feature and fourteen since he made Galaxy Quest). Everything about this movie feels like it was made for TV from the shot selection to the poor use of widescreen to the choppy editing. There are some high points to be sure. As an action/comedy Red 2 may be unsatisfying on the ""action"" side but it at least partially compensates with its ""comedy."" Although the novelty factor of seeing old respectable geezers hoisting big guns was used up in Red theres still something amusing about watching Oscar winners like Helen Mirren and Anthony Hopkins wandering around in Bruce Willis territory. The repartee between Willis and Mary-Louise Parker is sharp and John Malkovich gets his share of nice scenes and snappy one-liners. The overall feel of Red 2 is breezy although the lugubrious storyline makes it seem longer than it needs to be. Its hard to argue that Red 2 is especially worse than many of the other intelligence-deficient action-oriented motion pictures of the summer of 2013 although its certainly not up to the level of the original Red. The film has its charms but the end result feels like warmed-over James Bonda| and not even especially good 007 at that.

"RED 2 shows its age with tired sequel | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesRED 2 shows its age with tired sequelRED 2 cant match the laughs and heart of the original despite a bigger cast and globe-trotting scope. By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. July 18 2013RED 2Starring Bruce Willis John Malkovich Mary-Louise Parker Helen Mirren Anthony Hopkins Catherine Zeta-Jones and Byung-Hun Lee. Directed by Dean Parisot. 116 minutes. Opens July 19 at major theatres. PGHelen Mirren still has a great pair of guns -- and knows how to use them in the few scenes she gets -- but much of the unexpected fun found in 2010s RED has departed to make room for a bigger cast and globe-trotting scope with sequel RED 2.Morgan Freeman is gone and a new director (Galaxy Quests Dean Parisot who knows a thing or two about reinterpreting genres) is in the drivers seat for the next go-round with a cadre of quick-lipped current and former spies of the Retired Extremely Dangerous squad who blend smarts lethal skills and cool heads when the bullets fly.Article Continued BelowBased on characters from the DC Comics limited series the clan is now down to Frank (Bruce Willis) and Marvin (John Malkovich). Only Frank is taking the ""retired"" part to heart content to troll the aisles at Costco for deals on power washers with girlfriend Sarah (Weeds Mary-Louise Parker).Shes itching for a little more excitement in their relationship and cant believe her luck when ex-spook Marvin appears and tries to lure a reluctant Frank back into the game with a story about a looming threat. ""You havent killed anybody in months"" Marvin chides him.Seems there may be something to Marvins paranoid rantings launching a confusing plot from returning writers Jon Hoeber and Erich Hoeber (Battleship) about a top-secret project dubbed Nightshade and a missing portable cold war nuclear device that a bunch of governments want to get their hands on.With various agents including an icy-eyed American badass Jack Horton (Neal McDonough) convinced Frank is involved in Nightshade the three go on the lam international style hoping to find and disarm the device while saving their skins.Not that its going to be easy. Cucumber-cool Victoria (Mirren) pauses mid-assassination to warn Frank from the other side of the pond that he has a price on his head and shes been hired to do the deed by MI6. And shes not the only one with Frank in her sights.Talk about overkill. Korean super-assassin Han (Byung-hun Lee clearly added to skew to a younger audience) is also ready to take him out at the behest of the Americans.Luckily Marvin always knows how to dress for the occasion never wearing the same garish outfit twice not to mention finishing things off with a stunning wardrobe of hats that may set a new record for onscreen haberdashery.The action hops from London to Paris to Moscow and the plot takes on even more convoluted twists as Katja (Catherine Zeta-Jones) a Russian agent and femme fatale from Franks past (""Franks kryptonite"" Marvin unwisely tells Sarah) shows up and to put Sarahs nose out of joint.The only person who can shed light on Nightshade is its mad scientist creator Edward Bailey (Anthony Hopkins) who has been locked up for more than 30 years shades of Hannibal Lecter in a sealed room in a psychiatric facility scribbling equations on the walls and talking to unseen compadres.Trying to get inside to find Bailey gives rise to a good gag involving Mirren. It makes us wish there was more of her and a little less of Zeta-Jones whose underwritten part is hardly worth the screen-time.Sarcastic quips and verbal jabs make for amusing moments and Parker is never less than quirkily charming as the chronically up-for-it Sarah. But for the most part RED 2 feels like little more than a travelogue with lethal weapons as the gang skips to various cities amid noisy shoot-ups and car chases.Still theres always time for a heart-to-heart where various players share insight into how Sarah and Frank could solidify their relationship. ""Rent Dirty Dancing and tell her you love her"" Victoria suggests.RED 2 moves at breakneck speed barely stopping for passport stamps as it jets off to another international capital yet it often feels tired and by the book missing the heart of the original in ways that cant be enlivened by any number of crazy lids on Marvins addled cranium.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Summit Entertainment photo Geriatric assassins reunite in Red 2 By Joe Williams joewilliamspost-dispatch.com 314-340-8344 Joe Williams Jul 18 2013 (...) Summit Entertainment From left Mary-Louise Parker Bruce Willis and John Malkovich in ""Red 2."" Summit Entertainment photo Roger Ebert used to say that a movie that satisfies its target audience is a success and that judging whether it makes the world a worse place is beside the point. Yet we both felt the first ""Red"" was a lukewarm thriller and hes not around to suffer through this sequel so Im free to violate my heros dictum. ""Red 2"" is not just a bad movie its bad karma. And the target audience of adult moviegoers who respect the names in its once-vital cast have a bulls-eye on their collective cranium.Former spy Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) is once again living a quiet life in suburban Kansas with goofy girlfriend Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) but the CIA still deems him ""retired extremely dangerous"" (i.e. ""red""). When his LSD-addled comrade Marvin (John Malkovich) learns about a doomsday weapon that may soon be unleashed world-weary Frank wants no part of the action. But Sarah thinks that dodging bullets will spice up their relationship and the arrival of some trigger-happy feds and a Korean hitman (Byung Hun Lee) convinces Frank that the fate of the world is at stake.The nonsensical plot is an excuse to reunite the Americans with former British spy Victoria (Helen Mirren) and to reunite Frank with an old flame Russian agent Katja (Catherine Zeta-Jones). The geriatric action lumbers from Paris where a source knows the whereabouts of mad scientist Bailey (Anthony Hopkins); to London where Bailey has been locked in an asylum for 30 years; to Moscow where Bailey may have planted a bomb to trigger World War III. The car chases fistfights and shootouts are painful to watch not just because theyre ineptly staged but because they entail collateral damage that makes these ostensibly lovable assassins even less sympathetic. Its bad enough that they machine-gun the guards at a foreign embassy but driving a Porsche through a Parisian newsstand is the last straw. A faintly bright spot in this dim-witted flick is Parker whose big eyes reflect the absurdity of her surroundings but the script betrays her. It continually substitutes dark-humored violence for character-driven comedy or sociopolitical satire.With a world of possibilities to chew on ""Red 2"" is toothless.

(SMPSP) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Thursday July 18 2013 200 AM Title ""RED 2 Film Info PG-13 Violence gunplay language. Area theaters. Sometimes credit can be given for not trying too hard. In which case ""RED 2"" generally comes out ahead for being so laid-back. This oldster-spies-in-from-the-cold flick is a sequel no one was asking for. Yet its here anyway and as the stars saunter through the movie starts to feel like a spy flick molded around a Dean Martin celebrity roast. Its never laugh-out-loud funny or inside-track smart but in a summer full of bombastic failures a lack of pretense is enough. Bruce Willis is again Frank Moses the former CIA black ops agent who as in the first film from 2010 is forced out of hiding. Frank and his loopy pal Marvin (John Malkovich) are classified RED -- ""Retired Extremely Dangerous."" They still have the skills to kill; they just need an excuse. Luckily Interpol gives them one when they interrogate Frank and set off double-agenting aplenty. John Malkovich takes a wacky turn as a retired spy in RED 2. (Jan Thijs) The reason for concern is a dormant ""doomsday device"" left over from the Cold War. Worried itll fall into the wrong hands Frank and Marvin go after it themselves with Franks nonsecret-agent girlfriend Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) tagging along. Going to such exotic spots as London Paris and um ... Teterboro N.J. the trio elude a contract killer named Han (Korean star Lee Byung-hun) and constant traps. In Russia they link up with Franks old KGB flame Miranda (Catherine Zeta-Jones) team up with ex-MI6 spy Victoria (Helen Mirren) and find the addled scientist (Anthony Hopkins) who can stop the imminent explosion. All this is just an excuse for seasoned pros to play with firearms and spoof action-thriller conventions. Willis off-the-cuff performance and side-of-the-mouth delivery work better than in the last ""Die Hard"" movie and Malkovich knows exactly whats required of him. When he sees a hole in the movie he hams it up. Perhaps only he could deliver lines with a mouthful of chips. From left Catherine Zeta-Jones Mary-Louise Parker and Bruce Willis in RED 2 (SMPSP) Hopkins meanwhile does an imitation of a shambling old academic that seems to spoof some of his 1980s and 90s turns. As for the ladies Parker is required to be a bit too cutesy-girlie (she sobers up for her major moment when she gets to fire the gun shes been coveting) and Zeta-Jones is a come-on punch line. But silver fox Mirren knows the score and has a sexy ol blast as the teams hidden weapon. All of them get their big entrance a moment of heroism and a quick chance to emote. But generally their mission is to let the unnecessarily jammed-up plot play second fiddle to charm. Which for this gang is the right shot to take.

Share Tweet Perhaps future pop-culture historians will be able to understand the root cause of the Old People Craze Of 2010 a still-unexplained nationwide epidemic of gerontomania that put Betty White on Saturday Night Live made Tavi Gevinson dye her hair gray and turned The Expendables into a viable blockbuster model kicking off a cycle of past-their-prime action vehicles that will continue into the foreseeable future. This fad also turned Red--a loose Warren Ellis adaptation about a group of retired CIA operatives--into an unlikely sort-of-hit. Its sequel Red 2 downplays the no-longer-fashionable retirement angle instead focusing on its characters blase attitudes toward death. Like its predecessor its a one-joke movie; the difference is that this time around the joke is better. Red 2 stars Bruce Willis and John Malkovich as black-ops agents who are targeted by their former employers as part of a cover-up related to one of their Cold War-era assignments. (This is also the plot of Red which makes Red 2 as much an exposition-less remake as a sequel.) With Willis girlfriend Mary-Louise Parker in tow they race around Europe following leads and tussling with CIA goons. Meanwhile their former comrade-in-arms Helen Mirren--introduced in a hotel room littered with corpses--is given the plum assignment of assassinating them. Red 2s snappy dialogue and zippy pace suggest a 60s-style globe-trotting caper comedy albeit one with a lot more killing. Though Parker is the teams civilian outsider the movie wisely avoids turning her into an audience surrogate or straight man; Willis under-reactions and Malkovichs aloof weirdness are the movies core and counterposing them with a surprised voice of reason would rob the film of its transgressive kicks. Interestingly Red 2 may be one of the few films improved--or at least refined--by its PG-13 rating; despite the high body count violence is never lingered on which reinforces the idea that its the characters nihilism and not the violence thats supposed to be funny.

"Review Red 2 plays it too safe - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Red 2 plays it too safeBy Tony Hicksthicksbayareanewsgroup.comPosted 07/17/2013 115240 AM PDTUpdated 07/17/2013 030102 PM PDT In 2010 ""Red"" delightfully sneaked up on us. The story of retired CIA black-ops veterans pressed back into service was funny and fresh and most importantly gave the world the chance to watch Helen Mirren kick butt in ways that would make Jason Bourne think twice about stealing her purse. The film did so well that producers whipped up ""Red 2"" for Mirren Bruce Willis John Malkovich and company. Unfortunately while the sequel manages to retain some of the charm of the original it does little else. There is a sense that ""Red 2"" is resting on its laurels and relying on the audience to simply enjoy the interplay among the actors while absorbing jumbled plot points that are being offered without much explanation.Who were the bad guys? Im still not sure.But at least the actors look like they were still having fun in a ""Lets Make Oceans 13 so George Clooney can hang out with Brad Pitt and Matt Damon some more"" kind of way. All of which adds up to a movie that isnt particularly good but is still fun thanks mainly to the sheer strength of the cast.At times ""Red 2"" is like watching a Dean Martin roast back in the 70s (get on YouTube and search for Don Rickles and Frank Sinatra). Theres not a lot of substance but its difficult not to enjoy watching the interplay of talented funny people who seem to enjoy working together.Advertisement A new cast member Korean martial arts wizard Byung-hun Lee shows off some subtle comedy chops as a hit man out to get Willis Frank Moses who has been accused of hatching an operation called ""Nightshade"" that involved a hidden portable nuclear weapon. Another new edition Anthony Hopkins plays a semi-looney scientist who created and hid a suitcase nuclear weapon some three decades ago the finding of which is the centerpiece of the film.

R.I.P.D. 3D Only God Forgives Girl Most Likely The Hunt Crystal Fairy Deceptive Not surprisingly the story line is more humorous than logical. Of course its funny when Malkovichs neurotic socially challenged Marvin Boggs tracks down Moses at Costco -- where hes trying to engage in some domestic shopping with his partner Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker) -- to tell him he thinks theyre in trouble and to remind him after all that Moses hasnt killed anyone in months. And Mirren is always a pleasure to watch especially when hilariously disposing of a body while talking business on the phone.But step back from the comedy and the story gets thin. The first film dealt more with retired spies trying to adjust to real life which gave it some depth. Now that story line just feels played out especially since Willis has seemingly dedicated his career to playing aging former military and law enforcement studs out to prove they havent lost their edge (Willis is supposedly lined up to play a retired CIA agent/mentor in an upcoming adaptation of one of Vince Flynns Mitch Rapp books).Parker is a pleasant surprise showing comedic chops and a newfound ability to get into the violent swing of things. She steals a number of scenes especially those with Catherine Zeta-Jones Russian agent (and Moses former flame) Katja.But for the most part the surprises are few and far between. Fans of the first film should view ""Red 2"" as a chance to savor the interplay of very good actors but not much else -- meaning it is likely worth a matinee or a rental down the road. Which is a shame; the first ""Red"" was a great idea and an unexpected hit. Any good spy has to take risks to be successful. Too bad director Dean Parisot and his team didnt employ the same concept.Contact Tony Hicks at Facebook.com/BayAreaNewsGroup.TonyHicks or Twitter.com/insertfoot.

Fabulous. Wednesday July 17 2013 at 4 a.m. By Stephanie Zacharek Hellen Mirren in Red 2. The world is full of lackluster movies. But the world is not full of Helen Mirren in a Marlene Dietrich fedora or Helen Mirren in full-tilt eveningwear disposing of a bothersome corpse in a marble bathroom or Helen Mirren firing a massive rifle-type thingie while sprawled on a picnic blanket -- in her stocking feet no less. We all know there are few great roles for ""older"" actresses but perhaps worse than that there are so few movies that will allow them to just be without playing a role model or a wronged wife or a matriarch facing a life-threatening illness. Dean Parisots Red 2 isnt as much fun as its predecessor the 2010 Red was. But watching Mirren being fabulous? It never gets old. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Red which was based on the series of graphic novels by Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner and directed by Robert Schwentke stole onto the scene without having the luxury of knowing it would become a surprise success. Even though it featured Bruce Willis playing for the trillionth time an aging action hero the movie still had a casual tossed-off quality; it glowed with the aura of not trying too hard. Red 2 gives the impression of being oodles more fun while really just being more self-conscious. The gags are clever and goofy -- a villain puts an extraordinary number of bullet holes into a row of parked vehicles while handily missing his two targets -- but the connective tissue between them is stretched too thin. Its the kind of movie where you spend most of your time waiting for the next thing to happen rather than living in the moment.Thats not to say Parisot -- who must always be hailed for giving us the extraordinary 1999 Galaxy Quest -- doesnt have some fun with the details. And he clearly knows that the plot is beside the point. Willis returns as retired CIA black-ops guy Frank Moses -- ""RED"" is an acronym for ""retired extremely dangerous"" -- whos now trying to live a quiet life with his sweetheart Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) just shopping at Costco and the like. Hes lured out of retirement again by his nutball pal Marvin (played by John Malkovich in a performance thats a marvel of doofiness). Apparently the wrong people -- are they ever the right ones? -- are trying to procure a Cold War-era nuclear weapon. Moses Sarah and Marvin head to France London and Moscow in a concerted effort to (a) stem the damage and (b) not be killed. Their path is strewed with baddies semi-baddies and possible nonbaddies in the form of Catherine Zeta-Jones Natasha-type hottie Katja Anthony Hopkins mad bumbling scientist Bailey and sexiest of all Byun-Hung Lees Han a contract killer who thinks nothing of leaping into hand-to-hand combat dressed in a Sean Connery-era James Bond suit and French-cuffed shirt complete with cuff links.Film Details Red 2 RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time116 More Info Trailer It should all be so much fun. But Red 2 just feels dutiful as if its relieved that all its parts somehow fit together properly. Even though its probably supposed to look glamorous and glowing cinematographer Enrique Chediak gives the picture a generic action-movie sheen thats decidedly inelegant. Willis is reasonably charming in his ""Just me and my cueball"" way and Parker is amiable enough though her character gets saddled with some degrading behavior masquerading as self-denigration Jealous of Moses history with the superhot Katja Sarah goes shopping in Paris and kits herself out in some really ugly stuff.Then again how could Parker -- lovely as she is -- compete with the radiant Mirren? Red 2 disappointing in so many ways isnt torture to watch in part because Mirren has even more to do than she did in the first installment. If you love her you really want to see her in a glorious decolletage-revealing evening gown and dangling earrings idly but expertly pouring acid on some poor dead jamoke while carrying on an otherwise normal cellphone conversation. In Red 2 Mirren works it without working at it. After a certain age most women feel they have to try harder. Its only natural and deep down Mirren may feel that way too. The difference is that she never ever lets it show.Follow VoiceFilmClub1 Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Stephanie Zacharek Follow szacharek Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

TWITTER Bruce Willis John Malkovich Helen Mirren and Mary-Louise Parker reprise their roles from the 2010 action comedy. With the concept of retired secret agents pressed back into service by imminent threats to their lives 2010s Red benefited from a wave of enthusiasm for high-octane baby boomer action comedies now mostly either forgotten or entering their second or third iterations. By now the interest factor in a Red sequel is more in the execution than almost anything else particularly since Red 2 doesnt have a whole lot new to offer. Not that it isnt entertaining but the films premise is certainly well past its ""use by"" date resulting in another passably palatable sequel distinguished by a lack of narrative and stylistic coherence that could potentially underpin a really viable franchise. While Red 2 could benefit from the shift to a mid-summer release the field of openers and holdovers is also well-crowded with comedy and action options which might serve to divert attention at the box office. Now a happily contented man indulging his domestic instincts retired CIA field agent Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) has settled down with Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) the much younger woman who fell in love with him after he repeatedly saved her from various attempts on her life by the CIA FBI and various law enforcement agencies in Red. PHOTOS Senior Superheroes 19 Action Stars Kicking Butt Past 50 But coupled life has gotten rather routine for Sarah so when Franks perennially paranoid former partner Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich) unexpectedly turns up spouting warnings about a plot to take them out Sarahs more than ready to listen despite Franks resistance. Hes quickly persuaded however when a car bomb kills Marvin and hes dragged in for questioning about a clandestine Cold War-era mission called ""Nightshade"" that hes suspected of having coordinated. Denying any knowledge Frank quickly becomes a liability to Pentagon special agent Jack Horton (Neal McDonough) whos about to finish him off when Marvin turns up very much alive and well-armed rescuing Frank as they go on the run with Sarah once again in tow. Nightshade it turns out was a briefcase nuke that Frank and Marvin unwittingly helped smuggle into the Soviet Union in the 70s. Its whereabouts are currently unknown -- even to them -- regardless of the opinion of a rogue group within the Pentagon which is determined to retrieve it. Unable to bring in the former CIA spooks however the DOD recruits a couple of expert assassins Franks former MI6 British counterpart Victoria (Helen Mirren) and ruthless South Korean contract killer Han (Byung Hun Lee) setting off a chase across Europe to determine the location of the Nightshade device. In Paris the Americans meet up with Katja (Catherine Zeta-Jones) a Russian agent and Franks former flame whos assigned to locate Nightshade for the Kremlin. Her amorous reunion with Frank traps him between Sarahs ire and the mission exigencies but when Han arrives heavily armed and primed to eliminate Frank and Marvin a fortuitous discovery sends them back to London to retrieve elderly scientist Edward Bailey (Anthony Hopkins) a weapons expert whom Frank believes died during the Nightshade operation. By now Victoria has rejoined her old comrades leading Frank deep within a British psych prison to extract Bailey an addled genius with apparent memory loss and no clear idea of what might have transpired four decades ago in Moscow -- which is exactly where theyll have to go to seek out the weapon if they can manage to counter Hans repeated ambushes Horton and the federal agents on their tail and an installation full of Russian military experts. Dipping back into the source material created for DC Comics by Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner returning screenwriters Jon and Erich Hoeber effectively revive their team of ""retired extremely dangerous"" characters but then subject them to an uninspired generic narrative that rarely rises above the strictly routine. Fortunately these characters still have some life left in them even if the spark has diminished somewhat. Action-comedy has long been Willis strong suit which he reprises here with aplomb although rarely appearing to completely revel in the role of Frank Moses as he did in the original film. An ongoing gag about his domestic tendencies plays well against type but when the action thickens he relies more on ironic facial expressions and all-out physicality rather than a more refined comedic performance. Nobody does nutty quite like Malkovich and if anything hes in even finer form throughout the sequel amping up the paranoia and angst to an almost contagious level. Once again providing the catalyst that makes the Frank-Marvin deadly-kooky double threat work so well Parker might be the best of the three. Sarahs character and screen time have been noticeably improved upon -- her gently humorous line readings and expertly timed physical comedy end up stealing more than a few scenes. With a supporting cast that includes Academy Award winners Anthony Hopkins Helen Mirren and Catherine Zeta-Jones a director could hardly go astray. Mirren adds that touch of class thats delightfully upended by Victorias deadly serious determination and skillful weapons handling. Zeta-Jones nicely pulls off Russian spy Katjas mix of allure and menace along with Brian Cox returning as Ivan her romantic Russian counterpart with a Victoria fixation. Hopkins proves almost too much of a good thing calibrating his prodigious talent to impressively shift Baileys character from gently droll to threateningly unhinged in the narratives major plot twist. Byung and David Thewlis as an unpredictable wild-card character are both effective if rather underused. Dean Parisot -- taking the directorial reigns from Robert Schwentke - dials the films overall tone and action down a notch or two from the original. With such an accomplished cast globetrotting locations and alternating shootouts and chase scenes of prodigious proportions a degree of directorial elan might seem superfluous but downplaying a distinctive visual style ends up holding the entire proceedings back a bit. Whether theres enough gas left in the tank for another sequel might depend as much on the age and enthusiasm of the actors as it does on the movies performance. But when it comes to this crew of aging action heroes its best to never say ""retired.""

In his 90s superstar heyday Bruce Willis regularly spun screenwriters drivel into catchphrase gold with little more than his iconic smirk but decades later in a lackadaisical sequel no one asked for except perhaps his creditors he seems unmotivated to smile at all much less offer a series of emotions that constitute a believable or compelling performance. Meanwhile ""Galaxy Quest"" director Dean Parisot tests the boundaries of acceptable big-screen incompetence not only by eliminating everything that made its predecessor passingly appealing but ignoring any of the films own interesting ideas in favor of a glib travelogue that only occasionally tries to mimic a legitimate spy caper. See video Red 2 Trailer Helen Mirren at Her Deadliest Willis once again plays Frank Moses a ""Retired Extremely Dangerous"" CIA agent who now mock-enthusiastically shuffles up and down the aisles at his local Costco in an effort to stave off the boredom of domestic anonymity. His girlfriend Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) who is decidedly less excited about accumulating enormous quantities of perishable goods is thrilled by the prospect of some bona fide action after Franks longtime pal Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich) shows up insisting that Interpol is after them. But when Marvins conspiracy theories prove true the three of them set out to find whos been pursuing them and why eventually reconnecting with former colleague Victoria (Helen Mirren) and Franks ex-girlfriend Miranda (Catherine Zeta-Jones) as they simultaneously discover an international plot to set off a nuclear weapon in the heart of Russia -- which they are going to be blamed for if they cant stop it. See video Bruce Willis Mourns for Robsten With Die Hard Spoof There was a time when Hollywood was able to mostly to eliminate those post-""Pulp Fiction"" Tarantino knockoffs where hit men and heavies discussed mundane subject matter in between shootouts and showdowns -- and no one missed them either. ""Red 2"" inexplicably resuscitates that hackeneyed formula but seemingly only because ""Red"" and ""Battleship"" screenwriters Jon and Erich Hoeber had no other ideas about what these characters might do say or think about. At the very least the first film offered a cockeyed examination of former greats as theyre being branded obsolete; its metatextual portrait of Willis advancing career notwithstanding there was some fun to be had in watching the ""Die Hard"" tower-jumper face off against upstarts like Karl Urban while easing into his golden years alongside a group of respected older actors who were themselves eager to toy with audience perceptions. Here Frank Marvin and Victorias age is completely irrelevant except as a plot device to introduce them to even more aged performers -- in this case a loopy Anthony Hopkins. Remarkably the Hoebers took no cues from what worked in Robert Schwentkes original -- a scruffily effective ""Grumpy Old Hitmen"" for the action-movie set -- and instead assumed that audiences knew and loved the chemistry of these characters so much that simply putting them into action set pieces would be enough to keep them entertained. The action is across the board either uninterestingly or flat-out incompetently staged -- there are no stakes to any of the gun- or fistfights any truly perilous situations are defused by hackwork one-liners and the films escalation to what should be a pretty significant event a nuclear explosion is at best dismissively handled. But the bickering romance between Frank and Sarah which is cartoonishly complicated by Catherine Zeta-Jones Miranda simply poisons everything else in the film. Ultimately what feels more disappointing than the awfulness of ""Red 2"" is the sense that it didnt need to be awful even if it probably never needed to exist at all. Willis performances in ""Looper"" and ""Moonrise Kingdom"" last year proved that when hes engaged or maybe challenged he can still give amazing performances. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

More turns out to be less in ""Red 2"" an obligatory sequel that cant quite recapture the sly laid-back pleasures of its cheerfully ridiculous predecessor. While Bruce Willis John Malkovich Helen Mirren et al. are still good for a few chuckles as a gang of superannuated government assassins this globe-trotting action-comedy diversion applies a bigger-is-better philosophy across the board upping the stakes the firepower and the travel budget but keeping real thrills and laughs at a modest trickle. ""Red"" became a surprise hit in 2010 with nearly 200 million worldwide a feat that this Summit release will be hard-pressed to match even with solid opening numbers.This story first appeared in the July 23 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. Domestic bliss doesnt last long for ""retired and extremely dangerous"" black-ops CIA operative Frank Moses (Willis) and his loopy civilian g.f. Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker). Shortly after his old partner Marvin Boggs (Malkovich) dies in an explosion -- its no spoiler to report that he doesnt stay dead for long -- Frank finds himself being threatened and interrogated by a U.S. official (a reliably nasty Neal McDonough) about his possible ties to a bona fide weapon of mass destruction that went missing during the Cold War. Not long after Frank breaks free dodging and unleashing a spray of bullets in one of many heavy-artillery action scenes he discovers hes being targeted by not one but two assassins regal sharpshooter Victoria (Mirren) whos enough of a pal to give him fair warning and a head start and the much more dangerous Han (Korean star Byung-hun Lee). Frank Sarah and Marvin (see?) head to Europe in search of answers with Frank trying to keep Sarah out of harms way even though shes all too ready for some transatlantic danger. Zipping from London to Paris to Moscow the script loses no time in piling on the new characters many of whom are introduced with the sort of handy single-phrase sound bites that anticipate greater investment in the story than most viewers will care to muster. Apparently we are meant to be impressed by the fact that Han is ""the best contract killer in the world"" while sexy Russian spy Katja (Catherine Zeta-Jones) isnt just our heros old flame shes ""Franks kryptonite."" No such descriptions are offered in the case of British scientist Edward Bailey whos been locked up for decades and may know the missing weapons whereabouts but given that hes played by Anthony Hopkins and likes to scribble equations on walls one almost expects to hear him announced as ""Hannibal Lecter meets John Nash."" At times director Dean Parisot (taking over for Robert Schwentke) and scribes Jon and Erich Hoeber (who adapted the first pic from Warren Ellis and Cully Hamners graphic novel) seem to be aiming for the winking insouciance of an ""Oceans"" movie the sort of loosey-goosey all-hands-on-deck caper that knows better than to take anything -- especially murder -- too seriously. An amusing scene in which Mirrens Victoria gabs away on the telephone while absent-mindedly dissolving a corpse in acid is typical of the breezily offhand approach here and the use of stylized graphic-novel illustrations as scene transitions further serves to keep the proceedings at a cartoonish distance. But while its never less than watchable this sort of droll dark comedy is harder to pull off than it looks and the lightness that ""Red 2"" seems to be aiming for ultimately feels more like laziness from the cut-rate quality of the banter to the busy cluttered nature of the storytelling. Boilerplate twists and indifferent plotting were no hindrance to enjoying ""Red"" which got by on its marvelous actors and the wry even poignant conceit of professional killers being continually made aware of their own mortality. But that irony had more or less exhausted its potential by films end and the actors returning for duty though still marvelous have little to do but recycle their character quirks invariably to lesser effect. Parker who provided an audience entry point the first time around is less winsome here as someone whose default personality setting seems to be stubborn indignation and whose thirst for adventure is matched only by her exasperating incompetence in the field. The script falls flat in its attempts to turn her Sarah and Zeta-Jones Katja into heated rivals for Franks affections; it doesnt help that Willis has scarcely enough chemistry with either actress to light a match. Malkovichs crusty paranoiac routine and Brian Coxs boozy Russian romantic comic highlights in the earlier film are given short shrift here and while Mirren once again does everything in her estimable power to lend the picture a pulse and a personality the near-climactic image of her pulling out the big guns feels like a tired rehash. Of the cast newcomers David Thewlis at least makes a brief fierce impression as a tweedy assassin with expensive taste in wine while the ever-compelling Lee (""G.I. Joe Retaliation"") gets to show off his martial-arts prowess in the films best pure fight scene impressively staged inside a convenience store. Tech credits are sturdy but unremarkable; location lensing in France and the U.K. offers strong atmosphere though sequences set but not shot in Russia suffer by comparison.

Everton Carter (therealeverton) says July 15 2013 at 830 am Why say such cynical things as ""obligatory sequel"" when you are talking about films that you KNOW are based on sources with more than one story? So Lord of The Rings The Two Towers is n obligatory sequel now? Reply Just Confused says July 15 2013 at 1253 am Already looking forward to REDS 3 where AARP agents target the gang for not paying their dues. HOW ABOUT adding BETTY WHITE next go-around?
