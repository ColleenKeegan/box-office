Comments click to enlarge Grown Ups 2 Video Rated PG-13  100 minutes  2013 Adam Sandler Kevin James Chris Rock and David Spade reprise their roles as a gang of best bros from the 2010 hit; in this sequel which Sandler cowrote with Fred Wolf and Tim Herlihy the guys move their families from LA back to their sleepy hometown. Sandlers films have always been stupid but the early stuff (Billy Madison The Water Boy) is pretty harmless; here the jokes almost always come at the expense of someone else the kind of needless bullying one expects of a YouTube comment section. Gay caricatures abound and there are numerous jabs at mental illness--in one scene theyre even depicted as the same thing. Dennis Dugan directed.

"Small(er) Movie Roundup Because Even the Studio Knows RIPD Is a Toxic Stink Bomb << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Small(er) Movie Roundup Because Even the Studio Knows RIPD Is a Toxic Stink Bomb Courtesy of Film District Adam Sandler July 18 2013 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Only God Forgives directed by Nicolas Winding Refn How nice it would be to report that the second teaming of Refn and Ryan Gosling has produced something as ecstatic and electrically nasty as their first. But the nastiness this time isnt nice. Its just ... nasty. This isnt Drive. Its a rib cage rolling on human heads for tires. Gosling is a dude who operates a muay thai gym in Bangkok and dreams of having his hands sliced off. Hes not wrong to be scared. Vithaya Pansringarm plays an ex-cop who starting with Goslings rapist-murderer brother hacks his way through anyone who exploits or kills anyones daughters -- or anyone related to Gosling. Refn usually works on the border between classicism and formal chaos. His shotmaking and choreography are pristine even when the images are splattered with blood. The film editing is precise. The sound design imaginative. The art direction museum-quality. This is more of the same -- the Crayola color would be ""viscera"" -- but all that craftsmanship is put to obvious indulgent ends. It doesnt take long to deduce that the vengeful slicing and hacking of limbs and the like are Refn living out some kind of castration nightmare. (At 89 minutes the movie lasts as long as a bad nap.) To put too fine a point upon that dread along comes Kristin Scott Thomas as Goslings slum queen with a dirty mouth and filthier intentions. Her participation is as much a stunt as any of the sword work. (The most loving if grotesque image happens not to be phallic but vaginal.) Directors are always digging around in their psyches for material -- David Lynch Alejandro Jodorowsky Lars von Trier Gaspar Noe. Refns anxiety seems out to top theirs. But theres no joy or folly or transcendence. Its a one-dimensional video game of death with Gosling as its star. To love him here -- or Refn for that matter -- is to be a necrophiliac. Monsters University directed by Don Scanlon Its true that Pixar has entered a mortal phase. Last year it gave us a princess adventure (Brave) and now yet another sequel. Are they out of fresh ideas? It feels like the companys having a creative crisis but whats amazing is that you rarely feel Pixar panicking and you never feel any complacency either. It might assume itll make three-quarters of a billion dollars globally (the new movies more than halfway there). But God do they earn it. University is actually a prequel about how the big green eye Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) met James P. ""Sulley"" Sullivan (John Goodman) a horned bear with Koosh ball fur and wound up working at a power plant called Monsters Inc. As much you can appreciate all the astounding visual wit (the half-smile a young Mike makes after he impressed everyone with his scream a batwing mustache the mosaic tiling of one characters skin) theres nothing here as cinematically inspired as the galaxy of doors in the climax of the 2001 original. But the care put into the satire of college life is actually kind of moving. One critter uses extra arms for extra coffee and extra eyes for extra studying. Theres a black-light joke. Sully it turns out is an entitled legacy. The movie takes great pride in its laugh-out-loud jokes that hit the ideal spot between children and the parents theyve brought. This is a moment when studios dont often seem to be thinking about the ideal moviegoer just about the maximum number of moviegoers they can fit in a theater. Pixar -- which is owned by Disney which owns this site -- is no different in that regard but even in this relatively fallow period in which its short on masterpieces its never stopped thinking the most of us. Im So Excited directed by Pedro Almodovar Almodovars previous movie The Skin I Live In had Antonio Banderas playing a plastic surgeon who took gender reassignment to insane extremes and yet it wasnt insanity -- or even sexual audacity -- you sensed. It was formal restraint. It was medication. Some of us ardent Almodovar junkies have been waiting to see what would happen if he went off his meds. This trifling airplane comedy is the answer. Its set on a flight from Madrid to Mexico City. When the landing gear fails the pilots have to circle for hours and basically so does Almodovar who barely needs a reason for the queeny flight attendants first-class passengers and the two pilots to fight and fuck. (Presumably because of budgetary concerns and a probable lack of familiarity Almodovar drugs the passengers in coach.) The movie has its pleasures namely the bitching and vamping and eye-rolling and humping done by the cast which includes Javier Camara Raul Arevalo Carlos Areces Hugo Silva Lola Duenas and a characteristically imperious Cecilia Roth. Every safety sign looks like an erection and Peninsula Airlines just sounds phallic. Almodovar is basically exploiting what people presume an Almodovar movie to be -- bitchy campiness -- in order to get some stupid telenovela fun out of his system. By the time you see a pile of suds bobbing up and down the sight gags have basically driven over a cliff. Yeah this is what people think Almodovar is. But its Almodovar for people who assume they cant get Almodovar otherwise. Its Almodovar for Target. Computer Chess directed by Andrew Bujalski As romances go the one between Bujalski and his 44-year-old video camera brings a tear to your eye. The movies flickering black-and-white images shot by Matthias Grunsky on a version of the Sony AVC-3260 look so deeply found that you cant believe this movie isnt a retrospective of comedies shot with primitive AV technology. Its set somewhere in the late 1970s and early 1980s at a computer competition for software engineers trying to develop a program that can beat a human. The dozen or so characters get mixed up in various types of lunacy around the hotel -- drugs some kind of New Age spiritualism and one participants folly to avoid paying for a room. This is Bujalskis fourth feature -- his Funny Ha Ha helped launch so-called mumblecore moviemaking. Ive never liked that term or most of the movies to which that label gets applied but Bujalski never felt like a conscious member of any extant movement. He has an older soul; one with a little more magic a little more hope a little more adventure. His characters seem stuck but he doesnt. This time the adventure is both tonal and formal. It stretches the starch of work-conference doldrums into drollery. The camerawork and editing and sound design are impossible to predict. Bujalski is having fun with Night of the Living Dead on a community-access palette. But I also cant think of another director whos come closer to capturing how antique technology would dream about us. The Conjuring directed by James Wan No one needs to make another movie about a nice white family and the demons that possess them -- not even the director of the first Saw. The problem isnt that these films are all striving to be The Exorcist or The Omen its that none of them get there. The Conjuring more or less continues what went down in Mama that hit with Jessica Chastain from January. Its as if evil is working on a continuum that rarely leaves 1970s plots. This movie has a couple good moments nearly all of them requiring Lili Taylor to work very hard at seeming satanic. She plays a mother and wife whose husband (Ron Livingston jaw dropped the whole time) moves her and their five daughters into the sort of house whose history real estate agents never come clean about. This place has a basement that doesnt stay boarded up for long. The clocks keep stopping at 307 a.m. And the girls acquire imaginary friends and sleepwalking talents. But Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson hit the scene as sexy ""ghost hunters"" and explain almost everything. Wan respects us enough not to lean on absurd effects and drunken editing to attempt to spook us. He holds his shots and uses wires to drag bodies across the living room and make chairs float off the floor. The movies absurd enough to get an audience screaming. Its just that if youve got Taylor Farmiga Wilson and Livingston in a movie the script should have more for them to do than duck when antiques fly at them and stare down crazy dolls. For Taylor this is a chance to revisit what she did in The Haunting. For us its deja vu. Every hand that reaches into a wardrobe every nervous trip into that basement just gets on your nerves. Satan needs to get over himself. The Way Way Back directed by Nat Faxon and Jim Rash The two guys who wrote The Descendants now bring you one of those ""summer that my life changed"" comedies. This one revolves around Duncan (Liam James) a 14-year-old loner whose acutely agreeable mother (Toni Collette) drags him to the beach-town home of her churlish new boyfriend (Steve Carell). It takes a while but eventually Duncan gets a job at a water park where hes shown the ropes by the resident man-child Owen (Sam Rockwell) who harbors a long-standing crush on a fellow employee (Maya Rudolph) while Duncan is in awkward pursuit of a girl next door (AnnaSophia Robb whos wonderful). Faxon and Rash are good comedic actors and theyve said theres some autobiographical material in their script but this movie couldnt feel less examined. No one seems to realize that Duncan and Owen have fallen into a kind of love that makes the scenes with Rudolph and Robb feel defensive and the ones between James and Rockwell feel illegal. And yet the deepening of that friendship provides the movie its only genuine emotional tension. Otherwise its tired jokes about lazy eyes shenanigans on the water slide and a double-extroverted Allison Janney taking over the movie because theres no one to stop her. All the perception is hidden behind a 14-year-old. Theres human ugliness (the relationship between Liams mother and her boyfriend and two of their friends a couple played by Amanda Peet and Rob Corddry threatens to turn into marital war) but the film has been complacently concocted for likability even as it gives you very little thats real structured or spontaneous enough to enjoy. If this movies a hit (and so far it is) its because its prechewed. ""By the studio that brought you Little Miss Sunshine and Juno"" brags Fox Searchlight in a statement of fact that sounds more and more like a punishment every time its used. Girl Most Likely directed by Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini Kristen Wiig plays Imogene a Manhattan arriviste socialite who after a miserable couple of weeks winds up sleeping on the floor of her estranged mothers Atlantic City shack. This should be just as mediocre as The Way Way Back. But it knows what it is -- or at least its determined to be more than a movie fallen off the Sundance conveyor belt. Michelle Morgans script traffics in the arrested development that most American situation comedy does now and the vapid fantasy fulfillment of so-called chick lit (that titles pretty awful). But Berman and Pulcini -- American Splendor The Nanny Diaries -- found a tone somewhere between tragedy and nonsense. Theyve also gotten all the actors to go under the top. When Annette Bening shows up as the mother your heart sinks for two reasons Less than 15 years separate her and Wiig and shes playing a woman whose daughter thinks shes the mother from hell. The movie gets some comedy out of that cliche. When Wiig gets her first look in years at Bening whos toned tan and full of weary maternity theres a cut to a wide shot of the frantic daughter trying to flee the scene. But Bening has too much dignity to play a Gorgon or Shirley MacLaine in Postcards From the Edge. The difference between what Bening does here and what The Way Way Back is up to is that she doesnt need us to like her. She likes herself and that self-enthusiasm becomes contagious. Matt Dillon plays her dimmish CIA boyfriend Christopher Fitzgerald her toddler of an adult son and Darren Criss the nice-guy singer renting out a room in her house (Imogenes not sleeping on the floor for long). You can feel all the actors wanting to be as casually good as Bening is. Criss is kind of a shock. Hes been rinsed of Glees gooey geniality. Now his earnestness seems all natural and you can feel Wiig being drawn to him as opposed to a screenplay forcing them together. He could spend the rest of his youth playing the kind of sweet confident boy toy who makes warm feel like the new hot. Museum Hours directed by Jem Cohen A woman (Mary Margaret OHara) goes to visit a gravely ill cousin in Vienna and spends many of her days in and around the Kunsthistorisches Museum where she acquaints herself with one of the guards (Bobby Sommer) an older man who in his narration of the film professes a love of the vast action-packed paintings of Bruegel. Its a love that Cohen an American experimentalist imparts and encourages. His camera lingers up close over the images. He dispatches a curator (Ela Piplits) to explain the paintings and the intentions of their author and to dismiss any dissent from the people on her tour. Ultimately though in surveilling Austrian street life Cohen attempts to become another Bruegel to show the ways in which we can be Bruegel or that Bruegel once was us. The movie has a slightness that at 107 minutes begins to feel slack and some of its 16mm high-definition images risk seeming washed out in the dark of an art house. But its delicacy is absorbing. And its commitment to the inexorable allure of watchfulness and observation is resolute. Yet the films two most striking moments feature a character with her back to the camera. Amid all the looking and dissection Cohen demonstrates an understanding of the individual need for increasingly elusive privacy that feels urgent wistful and quaint. Grown Ups 2 directed by Dennis Dugan If anyone else had made this movie -- ""anyone"" being say the goats at a petting zoo or a gang of middle school boys who spoke no English because their middle school was on Saturn -- you could salute the effort put into getting the men of Saturday Night Live to dress in tiny spirit squad uniforms and use their crotches to wash Kevin James and Maria Bellos car. You could admire the hard physical work the comedian Nick Swardson does to steal scenes from Adam Sandler and Chris Rock that Shaquille ONeal puts into making us believe hes related to Tim Meadows. You could say ""thank you"" for reminding us that funny women like Cheri Oteri Melanie Hutsell and Ellen Cleghorne are still alive even though theyre not particularly funny here. But kids didnt make Grown Ups 2. Grown-ups did. For all the writing Sandler did with Tim Herlihy and Fred Wolf for as close to intergenerational farce as the film gets what you feel is laziness. You feel the somewhat dismaying acquiescence to middle age while behaving as if adolescence never ended. This isnt a moral problem its a comedic one. The movie isnt sure whether having a family is hilarious or depressing. It just does stuff like make fun of Taylor Lautner who plays an acrobatic frat boy or have deer get up on hind legs and pee on Sandler and Salma Hayek. These movies are about four friends -- played by comedians -- remembering what it was like to be young. How much better for an audience would it be if they remembered what it was like to make comedy?

Grade D+ ""Grown Ups 2"" delivers exactly what its been advertising in trailers and on talk shows grubby low-comic escapism. Excretory products fuel the humor and jiggle shots supply the titillation for an hour and half in a cozy New England suburb where ordinary guys and gals lead the life of Riley. Here its still safe to prank or be pranked - even if youre a cop - and everybody knows your name except for obnoxious college kids who look down on townies. The movie is flush with selections from the PG-13 ""family comedy"" menu. Gas or fluid spouts from every available orifice starting with a gag about a urinating deer and ending with a running joke about a ""burp-snart"" (youll just have to use your imagination). Kids stuff cheese curls up a drugged-out semi-conscious school bus drivers nose. (He takes one out and eats it.) Bouncy cheerleaders in midriff-baring costumes put on a community car wash. Wives salivate over their buff exercise instructor. Husbands ogle their daughters sexy dance teacher. (Actually April Rose is billed as ""Hot Dance Teacher."") At a lakeside end-of-semester beer bash ripped frat boys led by the unbilled Taylor Lautner go all ""Porkys"" on our good-buddy heroes - Adam Sandlers Lenny Feder Kevin James Eric Lamonsoff Chris Rocks Kurt McKenzie and David Spades Marcus Higgins - and force them to leap nude off a 35-foot rock. Its all supposed to be wholesome all-American fun because in the end everyone returns to hearth and home except of course those nasty college kids. Heres what passes for a story this time out Lenny has moved back from Hollywood (where he was a super-agent) his designer wife Roxanne (Salma Hayek) has opened a boutique Eric owns an auto repair shop and Kurt is a cable guy. If Marcus has a job it sped right by me but it doesnt really matter because not one of them does any work. Everyone is celebrating the last day of school and taking it as a holiday - a half-day for the kids a whole day for most adults. It culminates in a 1980s party at the Feders palatial house. Both Rocks Kurt and Tim Meadows Malcolm show up as Prince. The film is partly ""Life Lessons for Dummies."" Lenny must get behind Roxannes determination to have a fourth child as well as teach his younger son how to combat bullying. Eric must stop hiding from his wife (Maria Bello) at his mothers house. Marcus must man up to being a dad to a hulking lad he fathered a decade and a half ago. And Kurt - well Kurt doesnt have to do anything as long as he provides Chris Rock with a chance to riff on the only funny lines. (He refers to an obese Caucasian bully as ""white Precious."") The film is mostly an exhausted middle-aged family-values version of ""This is the End"" with Sandler functioning as the host. He surrounds himself with 16 former ""Saturday Night Live"" members stand-ups from venerable Norm Crosby to funky Nick Swardson (who as the bus driver spends most of the film lying down) and athletes like Shaquille ONeal and ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin. The cast is like a cross between a Friars Club roast and weekend programming in a man cave. Everyone does shtick including the leads. James Eric is so huge that he requires a fist-full of five-hour energy drinks to get going. Spades Marcus is so scrawny and cowardly that he needs the protection of his latest lover - a hyper-masculine female bodybuilder ""Beefcake Kitty"" (Kris Murrell). Sadler shows his enduring love for his wife by setting off his first successful burp-snart. This dubious achievement is Sandlers greatest coup in ""Grown Ups 2.""

Credit Tracy Bennett/Sony Pictures Entertainment ""The partys over fellas"" says Adam Sandlers character Lenny to his buddies in ""Grown Ups 2."" ""Were irrelevant."" And though the box office may disagree his words arent far from the truth. The first ""Grown Ups"" in 2010 grossed more than 271 million worldwide; the sequel will probably rival that amount reaping lavish dividends for Mr. Sandler and his co-stars many of them his fellow ""Saturday Night Live"" alumni. Once again Mr. Sandler milks middle age for lucre nostalgia and clunky ham-fisted humor. But he has cause for concern.As often happens in follow-ups to hit movies connective logic flies out the window Lenny and his family have now left Los Angeles for his New England hometown and his friends -- girthy Eric (Kevin James) henpecked Kurt (Chris Rock) and randy single Marcus (David Spade) -- seem to have moved onto the block. Three are joined by their wives (portrayed by Salma Hayek Maria Bello and Maya Rudolph all talented performers slumming here). The ""SNL"" parade continues with Jon Lovitz Tim Meadows and Colin Quinn in smaller parts. (Playing a pronounced corporate supporting role Kmart.)There are numerous plot threads woven haphazardly. Mr. Spades character meets his son a delinquent raised by a distant ex; Mr. Sandlers objects to his wifes desire for another child; Mr. Jamess feels ignored by his spouse; and Mr. Rocks has earned a ""get out of jail free"" pass from his missis for a day because he remembered their 20th anniversary. Husbands you see are oppressed; wives are demanding.Oh a gang of fraternity lunks threatens the boys for daring to swim in their cherished childhood quarry lake. When Lenny throws an 80s-themed costume party (pop goes the nostalgia) the Greeks invade and a free-for-all commences in which age battles callow youth and townies fight collegians (dubious class warfare conducted on Lennys expansive property). For humor there is flatulence and urination (favored motifs from the first installment) belching vomiting simulated defecation abundant leering and jokes about mannish women and feminine men.This is pap plain and simple scattered raunch-lite devoid of emotional resonance. At best it sells itself on the spectacle of a TV shows cast reunion -- and even then it disappoints. With the debacles of ""Thats My Boy"" and ""Jack and Jill"" Mr. Sandler has increasingly squandered his comic capital. His onetime ""SNL"" brethren do themselves few favors -- beyond a paycheck -- by working in his orbit.""Grown Ups 2"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Bikinis and bodily functions.

You remember that era when the Adam Sandler movies were funny and when one could sense a new comedic voice forming? Those were nice moments and for about half a second youre in a good place due to the beloved films that formed the Happy Madison name. Then well ""Grown Ups 2"" happens and you realize that even good things come to an end and when they do its usually with a giant thud. The opening that manages to erase all goodwill? A buck pees on the entire Feder family for about five good minutes. Animal urination it seems is to be the opening gambit for ""Grown Ups 2"" and what a worthy beachhead it is. This scene cant help but make one wonder why the giant peeing buck didnt simply gore the entire family turning the movie into more of a digital short but alas theres 100 minutes left and no goring in sight. This is an ill-conceived move in the same way that tying your shoes together at the start of marathon would be. You wouldnt make it very far and youd have some serious scrapes on your knees to show for your stupidity. However to be fair after that initial nonsense transpires ""Grown Ups 2"" isnt so much actively terrible as it is just plain old not good. Theres a difference and if 2013 has taught me anything at all its that weve got to differentiate between massively awful efforts like ""Scary Movie 5"" and ""Movie 43"" versus the merely bland offerings of a film like ""Grown Ups 2"". Indeed if truly horrible comedies are a plate of rancid meat ""Grown Ups 2"" is a plate of gruel. You dont want to have to survive on gruel for any length of time but if youre hungry enough? Youll eat some gruel. Youll eat it right up. Thats ""Grown Ups 2"" for you and thats my poster quote for the movie. Please prepare the commercials. Blandness aside there are around a dozen chuckles in ""Grown Ups 2"". These arent full-throated laughs so much as an admittance that the film was at least attempting a punchline and that the effort wasnt completely unworthy. But credit given where credit is due these smirks form the best parts of the film especially paired with the odd sweetness of the franchise. Yes ""Grown Ups 2"" is a largely sentimental movie which is a strange thing especially given the unorthodox route they take to pull at the heartstrings. Add all of this together and you end up with a sequel thats every so often funny sometimes sweet and featuring the best performance Taylor Lautner has ever given (no seriously). Certainly ""Grown Ups 2"" could have been far worse. Faint praise to be sure but its all they can manage given the rather largish constraints on the entire enterprise. Those constraints include the lukewarm portions of ""Grown Ups 2"" moments forming the vast majority of the movie filled with happenings that are neither funny nor particular interesting. Its here where ""Grown Ups 2"" offers up no real plot to speak of just all of the fellas (Adam Sandler Chris Rock David Spade Kevin James) wandering around town. Sometimes their children wander around and to switch things up occasionally the wives will wander around. Regardless of who is wandering around you can expect plenty of lame physical comedy a few pokes in the dark at a potential funny angle that they never quite get around to and other moments that are not so much offensive as they are completely innocuous. Theres a scene where a pervert gets a ladies workout class to do his bidding and another scene where a sixth-grade girlfriend to one of the guys becomes obsessed. These efforts pass like a wind on the night barely noticeable or worthy of contemplation. Unfortunately the terrible parts of ""Grown Ups 2"" do present themselves about as consistently as the chuckles. Oh the pee you will see plenty of that action plus simulated poop thrown in for good measure. And the Piece de resistance of ""Grown Ups 2"" a creation they are particularly proud of is the triple combo of someone (usually Kevin James) burping farting and sneezing in rapid succession. This is just as impressive and hilarious as youd expect which is to say its wildly stupid and misguided. Even more frustratingly they go back to the well on it about a dozen times as if theyve discovered the greatest invention in comedy since the slide whistle. Clearly thats awesomely annoying especially when combined with vomit more vomit and then a pee in a pool chaser (as opposed to deer pee). All of this is followed up by a guy being cross-eyed (which is the entirety of the gag). I dont know which four-year-old wrote these jokes but I sure hope he doesnt find future work. Should a gal or fella buy a ticket to ""Grown Ups 2""? No probably not unless said person enjoyed the first edition which is about the same in terms of a complete lack of substance. Its not a particularly watchable film though it doesnt actually hate its audience either as has become the custom in some of our worst comedies. Yep ""Grown Ups 2"" is gruel and occasionally grueling but rarely cruel. A movie of fools by fools for fools ""Grown Ups 2"" is easily forgotten which isnt as bad a feature as youd think. SCORE 4.4 / 10 Laremy wrote the book on film criticism and was always grown up even as a child.

(Tracy Bennett) By Stephanie Merry July 11 2013 Follow stephmerry Nearly every Adam Sandler movie seems to provoke handwringing over whether hes living up to his potential. Hes capable of portraying nuanced characters as he did in ""Funny People"" and ""Punch-Drunk Love"" but hes clearly happy to settle for his go-to routine of acting like a child and spewing lazy jokes that include his comic holy trinity bodily fluids flatulence and ogling scantily-clad women. The shtick must be rote by now and indeed ""Grown Ups 2"" appears to have been made while engaging as few brain cells as possible. The movie revisits the group of longtime friends that made ""Grown Ups"" a hit in 2010 bringing in 162 million at the domestic box office. That impressive if depressing sum shows the hunger for senseless summer comedies. But ""Grown Ups 2"" isnt merely mindless. At times it seems to actually drain IQ points from its viewers while wasting a talented cast of ""Saturday Night Live"" alums who are all capable of being much smarter and so much funnier. The film follows four men (Sandler Kevin James Chris Rock and David Spade) over a single day as the quartet plans a 1980s-themed summer kickoff party. But every man also gets his own individual story line each of which seems plucked from a bad sitcom. Sandlers Lenny is dealing with the fact that Roxanne (Salma Hayek) wants another baby; Kurt (Rock) gets to lord over Deanne (Maya Rudolph) that he remembered their anniversary and she didnt; Eric (James) has to hide frequent trips to his moms house from Sally (Maria Bello); and Spades Marcus finds out he fathered a son who happens to be a tattooed teenage thug. All these threads plus many more involving the younger generations love lives math deficiencies sports aspirations broken bones dirty diapers and bullying vie for attention over the course of the relatively short run time. Throw in a crew of frat boys led by Taylor Lautner who aim to destroy the middle-aged men and youve got one overstuffed film that only a runaway elk can resolve. 1 of 31 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad x Summer movie guide 2013 View Photos Catastrophes superheroes sequels -- the months ahead have it all.

For showtimes trailers and reviews click the bold text in each item. The Kings of Summer June 7 Two best friends (Gabriel Basso left and Nick Robinson right) and one oddball interloper (Moises Arias center) decide to escape their stifling parents and live in the woods for the summer in director Jordan Vogt-Robertss feel-good feature debut. Chris Gallettas hilarious heartfelt script could turn this little dramedy into the breakout indie hit of the summer. A cast filled with established comedians such as Nick Offerman and Megan Mullally plus fresh talent including Arias (looking like the next Zach Galifianakis) provides plenty of laughs. CBS Films Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Sandler must be adept at remembering to cash in on IOUs to assemble this crew of actors. At one point Hayek Rudolph and Bello have to act idiotic enough to believe a skeevy janitor (played naturally by Jon Lovitz) is their aerobics instructor and they comply when he orders them to turn around bend over and spank themselves. Female objectification never looked so stupid. The fact that some moments are genuinely laugh-out-loud funny almost makes the whole endeavor sadder. Each of these comedians shows how capable they can be of transcendent physical humor and even Shaquille ONeal who plays a cop lands some good lines. Why do writers Sandler Tim Herlihy and Fred Wolf have to sully those moments with jokes about a potbellied man in a too-tight T-shirt eating his own belly button lint? Why the need to forever spoil chocolate frozen yogurt with an inane and grotesque spectacle of toilet humor? Ruining a beloved dessert isnt Sandlers worst transgression however. That would be the way his movies make a movie critic feel like an old curmudgeon muttering to herself Seriously Adam grow up. ""Grown Ups 2"" r 1/2 PG-13. At area theaters.

Photo Everett Collection Being a grown-up is tough Sometimes just to provide for your kids you have to take a job thats tedious pointless and degrading. Like for example a role in ""Grown Ups 2"" the odious Adam Sandler sequel nobodys been clamoring for. Its the only explanation I can muster for why women like Maria Bello Maya Rudolph and Salma Hayek -- mothers all -- would sign on for this celebration of sexism homophobia and general a-holishness. All of which are also true of the original 2010s ""Grown Ups"" (both directed by longtime Sandler collaborator Dennis Dugan) but at least that movie had a plot. This time around the occasion is simply the first day of summer. Perhaps its a reimagining of ""Dazed amp; Confused"" for people who found Linklaters movie too highfalutin? Family is still the center of this sequel though the plot is nonexistent. (Everett Collection) Morning dawns in the hometown of Lenny Feder (Sandler) where hes moved with his family after giving up his Hollywood agent job. He and wife Roxanne (Hayek) are awakened by inexplicably a deer in their bedroom. It immediately pees on Lenny per the Sandler rule book. Underachieving friends Kurt (Chris Rock) Eric (Kevin James) and Higgins (David Spade) are still around though Rob Schneiders character is absent. (I like to imagine Schneider reading the screenplay and going ""This is beneath me -- and I starred in Deuce Bigalow 2"") Kurt is thrilled because hes remembered his 20th anniversary while wife Deanne (Rudolph) forgot which gives him a massive ""get out of jail free card"" to drink non-diet soda with dinner. Wives are so tyrannical (Rock almost never a good judge of a screenplay is better than this and spends the movie looking like he knows it.) Higgins is dealing with a visit from a son he never knew he had a sullen teenager (Alexander Ludwig) with a matching blond mop. And Eric is honing his ability to burp sneeze and fart simultaneously to the great envy of his mouth-breather pals. The movie lurches from one gross-out scene to another flipping the bird at continuity and logic. It honestly seems as if Sandler and his team descended on a random suburb halfheartedly improvising and moving on when they got bored. (At least Sandler and his two credited co-writers can congratulate themselves on how ""naturalistic"" their work is.) Once-promising comic Nick Swardson shows up as the school bus driver strung out on pills because his wife dumped him ""She caught me eating a banana with my butt."" Because hes actually gay ew The wives gather for an aerobics class where they shudder at the appearance of a mannish female instructor and coo over a hunky guy until finding out that he too is gay. The men head for the local swimming hole so Eric can face his fears (the movies big theme) by jumping off a cliff. There they encounter a group of local college frat jerks headed by Taylor Lautner (in a sobering glimpse at the post-""Twilight"" landscape) who develop a roided-up vendetta against the old dudes. ""Thicky Thick and the Flabby Bunch"" he dubs them in one of the films most creative moments. A brief reprieve comes when Eric and his wife (Bello) are bait-and-switched at a cheerleader car wash and Andy Samberg and a pack of younger ""SNL"" guys show up in skimpy shorts. You hope itll blossom into a Lonely Island video mocking the whole sexist premise but no such luck Its over after a few bars of Warrants ""Cherry Pie"" -- and Taran Killam licking suds off the windshield with gusto. Theyre the only ""SNL"" people you dont actively pity; Colin Quinn Tim Meadows Jon Lovitz Ellen Cleghorne and Cheri Oteri are another story. And lets not even talk about why Steve Buscemi is still showing up for these things. After stops along the way to watch Swardson defecating in a Kmart display toilet the school principal eating his own belly button lint Spade projectile vomiting Quinn in a poop-themed soft-serve gag and a lot of ogling of the hot school ballet teacher it all ends up with an 80s-themed party at Lennys where the host confronts his own childhood bully (Steve Austin who actually comes off as a nicer guy than Lenny or his friends). Spoiler alert The movie ends with Sandler literally farting on Hayek which must be punishable under some Hollywood bylaw. In any case Sandler sums it up himself halfway through ""Were irrelevant Were losers Were old"" Age isnt the problem buddy; nobody is more in touch with his inner obnoxious 6-year-old than you. But two out of three aint bad.

Billed as a comedy the film also features Kevin James Alexys Nicole Sanchez Chris Rock Maria Bello and David Spade who in this scene are all pretending to laugh at something that in all likelihood involves poo. Tracy Bennett/Sony Pictures hide caption toggle caption Tracy Bennett/Sony Pictures Grown Ups 2 Director Dennis Dugan Genre Comedy Running Time 101 minutes Rated PG-13 for crude and suggestive content language and some male rear nudity With Adam Sandler Kevin James Chris Rock Two decades ago when stupid Hollywood comedies were relatively smart they lampooned their own sequelitis with titles like Hot Shots Part Deux. The genre has become less knowing since then so the follow-up to 2010s Grown Ups is named simply Grown Ups 2. Grown Ups Minus 2 would be more apt. Like its predecessor this is a vehicle for Adam Sandler his pals and whatever they think they can get away with. That means some creepy sexual insinuations if not so many as the first time. But excreta and flatulence are the movies two true fixations (with projectile vomiting running a strong third). Indeed the story opens with a sequence in which a large male deer urinates copiously on not one but two of the characters. Its a fitting introduction to the movies tone. Rob Schneider couldnt make it to the set for the second installment it seems but the other principals play the same roles as before. Sandler is Lenny a Hollywood agent whos now relocated to the small Massachusetts town of his youth supposedly because its a more wholesome place for the three kids hes raising with wife Roxanne (Salma Hayek). Also living there are Marcus (David Spade) a single man with odd taste in women and two couples Kurt and Deanne (Chris Rock and Maya Rudolph) and Eric and Sally (Kevin James and Maria Bello) who have multiple children -- although not the exact same lineups they had previously. There are some family-dramedy issues. Roxanne wants to have a fourth child but Lenny is reluctant. Eric is spending too much time with his mother (Georgia Engel still riffing on her Mary Tyler Moore Show role as Ted Baxters naive girlfriend). Marcus meanwhile meets the son he didnt know hed fathered who turns out to be large and threatening. And two teenage offspring ponder their first dates. To call these plot points would be to overstate their importance. Even more than the first one Grown Ups 2 is a series of riffs skits and sight gags barely integrated into anything resembling continuity. Director Dennis Dugan a longtime Sandler enabler lines up the episodes competently but without anything more than a rudimentary sense of structure. Adding to the grab-bag feel are a large number of cameos Shaquille ONeal and Steve Buscemi take minor roles and Twilight werewolf Taylor Lautner flexes and flares as a shirtless frat boy who leads his fellow meatheads in clashes with the older guys. The reunited J. Geils Band actually performs during the 80s-themed party that serves just barely as a finale. And there are so many appearances by former Saturday Night Live cast members that the movie begins to look like a benefit for the SNL Pension Fund. Sandler one of three credited screenwriters gives Lenny a few parenting moments that in real life would require the intervention of Child Protective Services. But he is of course really a great dad. Deep down. Really truly. Grown Ups 2 doesnt push that button as often as its precursor did but this movie like all of Sandlers insists on its stars likability. It might be time for the actor to play a character who more honestly embodies the hostility his performances exude. But apparently Sandlers not grown up enough for that yet.

The deer then says hello by urinating in his face. This is the films way of letting us know that the comedy is going to be in-your-face. The first Grown Ups (2010) which critics unfairly trashed was Adam Sandler edging into middle age right along with his fans and doing it with an enjoyably self-deprecating finesse. In its slapdash way the picture was Sandlers autobiographical look at what an infantile anarchist has to give up to become a husband and father. In certain ways Grown Ups 2 marks a return to classically Sandlerian infantile anarchy. Lenny and his buddies -- the genially sharp-witted Kurt (Chris Rock) the put-upon mamas boy Eric (Kevin James) and the seedy eternal bachelor Marcus (David Spade) -- are as beleaguered as ever by the demands of family (even Marcus now has a long-lost switchblade-wielding delinquent son hes trying to connect with). Its not just that they cant let loose any more; its that whatever they do in the eyes of their wives it is never enough. The film doesnt present this as unfair The women like Maya Rudolphs no-bull Deanne and Salma Hayeks high-maintenance Roxanne are treated as hip smart matriarchs who are probably right to be constantly whipping their husbands into shape. But when the guys hijack a school bus from the local deranged bus driver the slapstick antics they get into are like a purging of everything that theyve been repressing. They proceed to take that bus on a joyride of damage. Marcus gets wedged into a truck tire that goes speeding and bouncing through town Eric keeps doing his ""burp-snart"" (a combination burp sneeze and fart) and the bus driver gets treated like the corpse in Weekend at Bernies. For a while Grown Ups 2 has the lunatic-stunt tone of one of the Jackass films and I mean that as a compliment. Its a decisively funnier movie than the first Grown Ups. After a while our heroes run into a pack of frat boys at the local swimming hole and the impromptu insult contest that goes down between the fascist college jerks and the flabby gone-to-seed older schlubs is -- how shall I put this? -- terrifically abusive. (Marcus ""Kid why are you acting so crazy?"" Frat-house lout ""Did Betty White just call you crazy?"") The frat boys are led by a hilariously smug Taylor Lautner who punctuates each insult by bumping chests with one of his fellow dudes and shouting ""Boom -- that just happened."" Yet through all the psycho silliness we feel the mens pain at the youthful vitality thats deserted them. When theyre forced to jump naked off the reservoir cliff their testicles hitting the water with a punishing smack its a metaphor for what life as sensitive and emasculated New Dads is doing to them. I dont want to make Grown Ups 2 sound like more than the high-spirited formula lark it is. The characters are still just likable Johnny two-notes. (And why has Rob Schneider been dropped from the pack?) But Sandler working with his regular director Dennis Dugan (the first Grown Ups You Dont Mess with the Zohan I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry etc.) has figured out how to age his brand on screen in just the right way. The movie is punctuated with peppery side characters like Tim Meadows fulminating bald nerd Malcolm and his Urkel-gone-hip-hop son (Kamil McFadden) and it ends with a 1980s-themed blowout bachanaal that is so goofily devoted to that era it made me realize that Adam Sandler may be as obsessive about the 80s as Quentin Tarantino is about the 70s. For Sandler its not just when he grew up. Its the garden of idiotic innocence something that in Grown Ups 2 he is helping to keep alive.

To read the whole story subscribe to BostonGlobe.com GROWN UPS 2 Share Comment Apparently the world demanded another family-friendly version of ""The Hangover"" one that combined scatological comedy with smarmy sentimentality. So Adam Sandler has obliged with this sequel to 2010s ""Grown Ups."" I guess the world should be grateful that he didnt make a sequel to ""Jack and Jill"" (2011). Since last seen super-agent Lenny Feder (Sandler) waxing nostalgic after a visit to his rustic hometown in New England and missing his childhood pals has given up his Hollywood life and moved back to the old neighborhood with his wife Roxanne (Salma Hayek) and three kids. Besides how else can a film open with a rampant deer peeing on someone unless it takes place in the country? As someone once said theres no place like home.

Grown Ups 2 (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Grown Ups 2 (PG-13) Try to find the plot in this stinker of a sequel. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle | cogleMiamiHerald.com7/11/2013 Editor rating 1 War plague pestilence famine tornadoes drought head lice cold corn dogs the fourth hour of the Today Show that Train song where the guy sings about wanting a two-ply hefty bag -- all of these things are far far worse than Grown Ups 2. And yet sitting through this deluded directionless relentlessly puerile comedy somehow feels equally punishing. The first Grown Ups was a middling family comedy about a guy named Lenny (Adam Sandler) and his childhood friends (Kevin James Chris Rock David Spade and Rob Schneider) who reunite after their basketball coachs death and reconnect by spending part of the summer together with their families. It was forgettable but sporadically amusing the actors off-screen friendships at least translating into some good-natured ribbing and unforced jokes. All you need to know about this new movie? Rob Schneider sat this one out. Yes. The guy who played Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo -- twice -- apparently said No thanks Im busy. Good move by him because nobody escapes untainted by the foul stench of Grown Ups 2; its bad enough to make you look askance at Salma Hayek Maria Bello and Maya Rudolph all of whom deserve a chance to do something funny other than pose as wives exuding various degrees of sexiness. Hayeks cleavage in particular is singled out; it gets more screen time than Steve Buscemi which probably works in his favor. The movie opens with a deer breaking into Lennys enormous house and peeing all over him. Consider yourself warned This is a harbinger of whats in store as well as a crass but effective metaphor for what the filmmakers are doing to the audience. What follows the peeing sequence is hard to explain because although three screenwriters are credited including Sandler theres no plot at all in Grown Ups 2. Zero. Nobody even tried to form any sort of narrative guideline (or write good jokes for that matter). Even kids movies -- maybe especially kids movies -- need some sense of framework or structure or point. Heres what Grown Ups 2 has Lenny the successful filmmaker has left Hollywood and moved back home with his family (Hayek and three kids) to enjoy the slower-paced small-town life. School is just about over for the summer. His pal Kurt (Rock) suggests Lenny throw a party to celebrate. And Lenny does. The end. Before we get to that blessed finale though there are many flatulence jokes; vomiting; Cheetos stuck up a nose and then eaten; a guy shooting himself in the face with pepper spray; assaults on the male cast members private parts; a guy dressed as Boy George making out with a dog; and Shaquille ONeal in a cop uniform. Turns out the Shaq appearance is necessary because the best joke comes at his expense. Theres also an ongoing battle between the middle-aged gang and a group of jerky frat brothers led by Taylor Lautner; the final confrontation takes place at Lennys big party which has an 80s theme presumably so Sandler could dust off and reuse some costumes from The Wedding Singer. He also dusts off the J Geils Band to perform and suddenly that Train song doesnt seem so awful. But can you blame Sandler for evoking the ghost of The Wedding Singer? Just think back to that funny little film for a moment. It was amusing. It had charm. It made you laugh. You didnt feel vaguely dirty for spending money to see it. Grown Ups 2 is not going to leave you with such a pleasant memory. Cast Adam Sandler Kevin James Chris Rock David Spade Taylor Lautner Salma Hayek Maya Rudolph Maria Bello. Director Dennis Dugan.

Credit Sony Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A sequel to Adam Sandlers 2010 hit about old friends who never change. (Rated PG-13) BOTTOM LINE Lots of below-the-waist humor but very few laughs in this uninspired retread. CAST Adam Sandler Kevin James Chris Rock David Spade LENGTH 141 In ""Grown Ups 2"" Adam Sandler returns as Lenny Feder a successful Hollywood agent who moves back to his small hometown to raise a family and hang out with old friends. Like the first movie in 2010 the sequel is selling a combination of comfy-cozy Americana broad humor and nostalgia. It all seems well-intentioned enough. So why does ""Grown Ups 2"" feel so relentlessly unpleasant? The talent is certainly here. Reprising their roles are Kevin James as amiable Eric Lamonsoff Chris Rock as cable-installer Kurt McKenzie and David Spade as still-partying Marcus Higgins. The jokes tackle seemingly cant-miss topics like spouses jobs and children. But something is missing. I mean aside from Rob Schneider who played a serial divorce in the first film. And aside from a script. And aside from respect for women (Maria Bello Maya Rudolph and Salma Hayek as various wives all jiggle and wiggle.) What ""Grown Ups 2"" is missing is a heart. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Who was the Sons of Anarchy Homeless Woman? For all its warm and fuzzy notions of family and community ""Grown Ups 2"" directed by longtime Sandler cohort Dennis Dugan has a desperate reliance on nasty jokes about pee poo and -- with surprising frequency -- gay panic. The film opens with a deer urinating on Lenny moves on to a chocolate ice-cream gag (Colin Quinn returns as soft-serve peddler Dickie Bailey) and repeatedly shoves straight male faces into same-sex genitalia. Nick Swardson a highly unwelcome addition plays a mentally ill bus driver who tongue kisses a dog. When the movie succeeds its in small ways that only make the larger picture seem dimmer. Taylor Lautner shedding his sulky ""Twilight"" persona is a bright spot as a hopped-up frat-boy; Shaquille ONeal is appealing as a fun-loving police officer; and Rocks lazy cable-guy (""some time between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m."") scores. Steve Austin as former bully Tommy Cavanaugh is the unlikely source of the only glimmer of genuine emotion. For one funny touching moment ""Grown Ups 2"" feels like the movie it could have been. 221 MoviesGrown Ups 2 trailer PLOT A sequel to Adam Sandlers 2010 hit about old friends who never change (PG-13) advertisement | advertise on newsday CAST Adam Sandler Kevin James Chris Rock David Spade LENGTH 141 BOTTOM LINE Lots of below-the-waist humor but very few laughs in this uninspired retread Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

"Review Grown Ups 2 refuses to leave the sandbox - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Grown Ups 2 refuses to leave the sandbox Grown Ups 2 Tracy Bennett / Sony Pictures Salma Hayek left Kevin James Alexys Nicole Sanchez Chris Rock Maria Bello Adam Sandler and David Spade star in ""Grown Ups 2."" Salma Hayek left Kevin James Alexys Nicole Sanchez Chris Rock Maria Bello Adam Sandler and David Spade star in ""Grown Ups 2."" (Tracy Bennett / Sony Pictures) Mark Olsen It is just a few minutes into ""Grown Ups 2"" when star Adam Sandler is peed on in the face by a deer. How one feels about that -- is it funny is it cheap is it a weird curiosity? -- will likely be an accurate litmus test for responses to the rest of the film.The 2010 film ""Grown Ups"" was among the biggest box office successes of Sandlers career so it makes sense that he would reunite with costars Kevin James Chris Rock and David Spade for his first sequel. As very patient wives Salma Hayek Maria Bello and Maya Rudolph are even more flagrantly underused here than in the first film. (Who knows what kept Rob Schneider from returning except for a rare display of noble decorum.) The first film was based around a reunion of childhood friends. The new film finds Sandlers character -- who made it rich as a Hollywood agent -- having recently moved back to his leafy East Coast hometown so his kids can ride their bikes to school and his family can live in a house exponentially larger than anyone elses in town.PHOTOS Summer Sneaks 2013 Directed by Sandler go-to Dennis Dugan from a screenplay credited to Sandler Fred Wolf and Tim Herlihy the films story is structured loosely around the last day of school which somehow allows the four fathers to have the day to knock around. Eventually last-minute plans to throw a party push the story along with most every character in the movie able to pull together an elaborate 80s-themed costume on a few hours notice.The films cast is nonsensically populated with Sandler regulars alums from various eras of ""Saturday Night Live"" random tween talents a Schwarzenegger-Shriver son a Victorias Secret model Shaquille ONeal a character apparently modeled on hip-hop personality Humpty Hump Steve Austin a ""Hunger Games"" actor and Taylor Lautner from the ""Twilight"" movies. The J. Geils Band play at the party.Late in the film Sandlers character bemoans the fact that they are all old and irrelevant that there should be no more parties for them just the low-key respectability of family-man responsibility. That concept and the tension it creates within the male characters is teasingly just close enough to an actual point to remind that this entire enterprise could have actually been about something besides whether chocolate ice cream looks like poo.PHOTOS Billion-dollar movie club Judd Apatows recent ""This Is 40"" more fully explored a similar anxiety of middle-age and the comedic pathos of everyday life with messily vibrant results. With the slack lackadaisical effort of ""Grown Ups 2"" Sandler has perhaps revealed himself not as a confrere of Apatow who directed him in ""Funny People"" to a performance both crude and soulful. Rather hes the white Tyler Perry smart enough to know better savvy enough to do it anyway lazy enough not to care.""Grown Ups 2"" looks like it was a lot of fun to make. And the last laugh is on us.mark.olsenlatimes.com--------------------------Grown Ups 2MPAA rating PG-13 for crude and suggestive content language and some male rear nudityRunning time 1 hour 41 minutesPlaying In wide release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Adam Sandler Movies Entertainment Grown Ups 2 Maya Rudolph Maria Bello Tyler Perry Review Fruitvale Station an incendiary portrait of a life cut short Review Grown Ups 2 refuses to leave the sandbox Review Killing Season has Robert De Niro John Travolta tedium Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad71deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-grown-ups-2-review-20130712,0,5880756.story",200,grownups217,grownups2,latimes
"Adam Sandlers Grown Ups 2 a gross and lazy no-star flop review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesAdam Sandlers Grown Ups 2 a gross and lazy no-star flop reviewAdam Sandlers Grown Ups 2 is his first sequel and its a winner -- of the prize for worst movie so far of 2013.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. July 11 2013Grown Ups 2Zero stars (out of 4)Starring Adam Sandler Kevin James Chris Rock Salma Hayek David Spade Maya Rudolph Maria Bello and Shaquille ONeal. Directed by Dennis Dugan. 101 minutes. Opens July 12 at major theatres. PGAdam Sandler scrapes the bottom of the barrel -- and then he pukes into it -- with Grown Ups 2 a lazily cribbed-together swamp of pointless and unfunny sketches that makes 2010s Grown Ups look like Citizen Kane.Theres no explanation why Rob Schneider isnt back for the further adventures of five high school pals from the class of 1978 who reunited to prove how little theyve matured. An attack of conscience perhaps? So now they are four Kevin James Chris Rock David Spade and their shameless ringleader Sandler. Article Continued BelowDennis Dugan (Jack and Jill) is back to direct for round two but theres little direction going on in this three-ring circus of cinematic torture.With only the barest excuse for a plot something about standing up to bullies and lets have an 80s-themed costume party Sandler and former SNL writers Fred Wolf and Tim Herlihy have created a script in name only. Gags written by a troupe of Ritalin-addicted monkeys are funnier -- and likely include fewer feces jokes.In fact bouncing boobs urine projectile vomiting hits to the crotch testicles and the contents of diapers seem to be an endless source of fascination for Sandler who opens Grown Ups 2 by being sprayed in the face by an enthusiastically peeing male deer. And he seems to have a sudden appreciation for inflatable rafts paging Dr. Freud.Selfish wiseasses who end up with audacious babes Sandlers Lenny is married to curvaceous Roxanne (Salma Hayek) who always appears to be one sneeze away from popping her buttons. Shed like to have another baby but Lenny wants to stick to the three kids he has.Its a good policy. The cutesy annoyances that populate Grown Ups 2 are already too much to bear.Sally (Maria Bello) married to James underachiever Eric -- whose claim to fame is he can burp sneeze and fart at once creating a ""burpsnart"" -- and Deanne (Maya Rudolph) wed to tricky cable guy Kurt (Rock) also partake in the crudity. Rudolph cant seem to believe the leering line shes given to purr to a buff fitness instructor. The joke like many others falls flat as an anvil.Weedy looking Marcus (Spade) is still understandably single. He discovers he has a son a hulking lug who shows up to spend the summer with his pop. Women are ill used throughout either set up as the butt of jokes or something to be ogled. Witness Paulina Gretzky playing a drunken college co-ed slurring and prancing about in a bikini. A career is born.The guys dont fare much better. Spade is stuffed into a tractor tire and rolled around until he vomits a green geyser. Meanwhile Twilights Taylor Lautner plays the most unlikeable character onscreen this year (and Im including the World War Z zombies) as a trash-talking frat boy. ""Why is this never ending?"" Eric wonders at one point. We feel his pain as the obligatory car-wash scene begins with soapy vixens and ""Cherry Pie"" blasting. But wait Its SNLs Will Forte and Andy Samberg rubbing their short-short-clad fronts on the windshield. HilariousThe huge cast appears to cover off all those Sandler owes a favour to from his SNL days plus a rag-tag bunch of cameos from Steve Austin to wrinkly 70s rockers The J. Geils Band.The original Monday night screening for Grown Ups 2 was cancelled due to a power outage at SilverCity Yorkdale caused by the massive storm that slammed Toronto.

Cast Adam Sandler Kevin James Chris Rock David Spade. Rating PG-13 for crude suggestive content language and male rear nudity. RELATED NEWS Adam Sandlers 10 worst movies By Randy Cordova The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Jul 11 2013 1004 AM In its own way ""Grown Ups 2"" sets the bar really high. After all its hard to imagine another comedy coming along this year that is this abrasive and free of laughs. Its like everyone involved intentionally tried to create a horrible movie. Touted as the first sequel in Adam Sandlers career -- as if thats a selling point -- the movie focuses on Lenny (Sandler) and his old high-school friends all living in the small town where they were raised. Essentially thats it. Sandler who wrote the film with two pals cant even be bothered to come up with anything resembling a plot. Oh things happen here and there The guys anger some frat boys; Lennys wife wants a baby; and there is a big 80s-themed party so everyone can wear silly costumes and the J. Geils Band (seriously?) can perform. But basically nothing of any consequence happens. If a movie is witty and halfway entertaining its easy to forgive all kinds of problems. Make the characters likable and thats a plus too. But nothing here generates any good will. The humor is repugnant obnoxious and repetitive. In one scene a deer urinates in Lennys mouth. If you thought that was a knee-slapper hang on for a few seconds because the deer then does the deed in the mouth of Lennys son. The cast really slums here. Returning from the 2010 original are Chris Rock David Spade and Kevin James as Lennys pals with Salma Hayek Maya Rudolph and Maria Bello as the women in their lives. It says something that Rob Schneider doesnt return from the first movie. You figure a project must have major issues if the star of ""Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo"" cant be bothered to turn up. The one moment that ekes out something resembling a smile occurs when Spades character dresses for the 80s bash as the mustachioed half of Hall and Oates and hes mistaken for magician Doug Henning.

Salma Hayak (from left) Alexys Nicole Sanchez Kevin James Chris... Grown Ups 2 Comedy. Starring Adam Sandler Salma Hayek Kevin James and Chris Rock. Directed by Dennis Dugan. (PG-13. 101 minutes.) ""Grown Ups 2"" isnt repugnant obnoxious or painful to experience. This would not seem necessary to say and under normal circumstances that could hardly be construed as praise except that recently the bad movies havent only been bad. Theyve actually hurt to watch. Indeed if you scooped up someone from 500 years ago some poor soul not inured to entertainment as a form of abuse and made the unlucky victim sit through either ""The Lone Ranger"" or ""Pacific Rim"" hed probably go mad and never recover. Thus the bar gets lowered and the temptation arises to say something nice about ""Grown Ups 2"" just because it doesnt cause injury. But no its a bad movie too just old-school bad the kind thats merely lousy and not an occasion for migraines or night sweats. It has five good minutes and theyre right at the beginning. Lenny - that is Adam Sandler - is a married man who opens his eyes one morning and finds a huge deer standing by his bed. Lennys wife (Salma Hayek) screams and the deer startled rears up and urinates in Lennys face. This is worth mentioning for two reasons first to establish right off that ""Grown Ups 2"" was not based on a Noel Coward play; and second just to put it out there that a urinating deer joke is perfectly OK - and even to be celebrated - so long as its funny. People go to ""Grown Ups 2"" for good well-timed urinating-deer humor and I for one am all for it. So the problem here isnt in the nature of this movies humor but rather in the failure of it. After the deer its all downhill though it takes a little while to figure that out. Characters are introduced - two other couples played by Maria Bello and Kevin James and by Chris Rock and Maya Rudolph respectively. The introductions are pleasant enough. But then just as the mechanism is in place for the movie to get started it stalls on a series of half-gags almost gags and gags aborted midway because they didnt turn out to be funny. If you ever have the mild misfortune of seeing this movie - say youre on an airplane and its either this or the in-flight magazine - notice how many scenes are cut off right in the middle because the joke never flowered. Of course the conscientious thing to do in that situation would have been to jettison the gag and write a better one but why do that if you can just lean on the talented cast to create an atmosphere of funny where funny doesnt otherwise exist? I feel the pull too. To see Sandler here in his appealing straight-man mode or Chris Rock who just shows up and you expect to laugh or Hayek who is a lively and appealing comic actress is to get ready and stay ready for a good time. Forget it. Its not coming. You might as well sit there and expect Godot to turn up. In ""Grown Ups 2"" the audience waits in vain. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Share Tweet Grown Ups 2 opens with a CGI deer invading Adam Sandlers bedroom standing up on its hind legs and pissing in his face; it ends with Sandler simultaneously farting sneezing and burping while having sex with Salma Hayek. In between the audience is treated to Nick Swardson shitting in a Kmart and making out with a dog David Spade sensuously licking a female bodybuilders bicep while wearing a John Oates costume members of The Lonely Island rubbing their asses on the soapy windshield of Kevin James car while wearing cheerleading uniforms and Shaquille ONeal filling a swimming pool with his urine. In other words Grown Ups 2 is a quintessential late-period Sandler movie. Largely free of Sandlers usual schmaltz and lame romance its pure plotless grotesque high jinks bizarre and inept in a way thats fascinating without ever being all that funny. The humor is largely based on bodily discomfort and shame with Sandler Spade James and Chris Rock--playing middle-aged men who dont take their shirts off when they go swimming--offering an endless stream of fat jokes muscle jokes short jokes tall jokes poop jokes and bald jokes. Set over the course of a single day the movie follows its four leads as they avoid work their significant others and their kids while guzzling various sponsored beverages. (In one of the laziest pieces of product placement in recent memory Sandler wakes up with an unopened can of Pepsi on his nightstand.) Along the way they run afoul of Milo Ventimiglias band of roving frat boys leading to climactic free-for-all at an 80s-themed kegger. Grown Ups 2 marks Sandlers eighth collaboration with director/yes-man Dennis Dugan a filmmaker whose style is distinguished by an inability to frame gags and a fondness for Pottery Barn interiors lit with soap-opera flatness. Like the other recent Dugan/Sandler movies--Jack And Jill Just Go With It--Grown Ups 2 is surreally shoddy Continuity and technical errors are the norm; the movies opening credits roll over mismatched low-resolution stock footage. Bad prosthetics and make-up abound; there are countless paste-on beards and wrinkly bald caps and two characters have fake noses that are the wrong skin tone. The crappiness of the filmmaking is so pervasive and compulsive that viewers may suspect that it constitutes some kind of perverse artistic statement--an intentional crass ineptness thats very much in line with Sandlers anti-snob worldview.

Adam Nayman Special to The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Jul. 11 2013 1021AM EDT Last updated Thursday Jul. 11 2013 154PM EDT Comments AA Directed by Dennis Dugan Written by Adam Sandler Tim Herlihy Fred Wolf Starring Adam Sandler Kevin James Salma Hayek Classification PG Genre comedy Year 2013 Country USA Language English The 1980s have their revenge in Grown Ups 2 The last half hour of Dennis Dugans comedy takes place at a costume party where the entire cast is decked out in full Reagan-era regalia from Hall and Oates and Boy George to Flava Flav and the Terminator. The spectacle of so many old-school icons locked in a no-holds barred battle royale feels torn straight from Adam Sandlers subconscious and Grown Ups 2 eventually reveals itself as a desperate exercise in nostalgia. Its a Hot Tub Time Machine of a movie that allows its producer-writer-star to project himself back into his glory days Its no coincidence that Sandlers character is dressed up as Bruce Springsteen. Multimedia Grown Ups 2 The official trailer Like its predecessor Grown Ups 2 is proudly retrograde both in its relentless deluge of toilet humour and the way it bear-hugs some good old-fashioned conservative values. As the film opens Sandlers Lenny Feder has moved from Hollywood back to his heartland hometown where its implied people are kind and decent and hard-working - except for the privileged lily-white college kids (led by a self-mocking Taylor Lautner) who serve as the films de facto villains.Not that there is much at stake here In lieu of a plot we get a series of loose barely connected vignettes where Lenny and his lifelong pals (played as in Grown Ups by real-life besties Kevin James Chris Rock and David Spade) clown around and reflect on the mixed blessings of middle age while their kids go through some middle-class rites of passage first beers first kisses and final reckonings with high-school bullies.Theres something fascinating about the tension between Sandlers bad-boy comic instincts and his sturdy suburban values and Grown Ups 2 is at the very least a work of sincerity. But the relaxed vibe only exacerbates the laziness of Dennis Dugans direction - there isnt a single well-staged gag in the entire movie - and the indifference becomes wearying. None of the stars are trying very hard and so the most memorable presences are the cameos If nothing else Grown Ups 2 will go down as the only film in history to find room for Steve Buscemi alongside ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin.

(Tracy Bennett) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday July 11 2013 1227 PM Title Grown Ups 2 Film Info PG-13 Crude humor language brief nudity. Area theaters. Sometimes its hard to know how to review an Adam Sandler film -- or if its even worth it. The first ""Grown Ups"" from 2010 earned a dismal 9% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes ... and then went on to earn hundreds of millions worldwide. Which means of course that we are now gifted with ""Grown Ups 2"" about which I can say well its certainly no worse than ""Grown Ups."" Like most Adam Sandler movies its exactly like most Adam Sandler movies. It was directed by Dennis Dugan whos contributed not only ""Grown Ups"" but several other titles in the Sander canon (from the high of ""Happy Gilmore"" to the low of ""Jack and Jill""). This movie stars all Sandlers buddies and gleefully embraces lowbrow crudity even while promoting loving family values. In other words Sandler has no need to mess with the formula so we should probably be grateful that the script (which he co-wrote) has enough moments of easygoing good humor to get us through the grade-school jokes about bras and bathrooms. The biggest asset of course is the cast whose offscreen camaraderie is evident in every scene. The filmmakers obviously know this since they barely bother to craft an actual story line. For the most part we tag along as recently retired Lenny (Sandler) and his life-long friends (Kevin James Chris Rock and David Spade) complain about their wives (despite being married to Salma Hayek Maria Bello and Maya Rudolph); ogle the single hotties in their hometown; and lament the good old days when they were in high school. Perhaps youve noticed that extreme wish-fulfillment is a major appeal of this franchise. The closest we come to a plot is a ""Revenge of the Nerds""-style rivalry with some moronic frat boys (guided amusingly by Taylor Lautner). This bitter feud comes to a head at a cleverly staged 80s-themed party at Lennys house. So really what is there to say? You know what youre going to get and that is indeed what Sandler delivers. Its juvenile its obvious and its crass. But with Sandler at the helm at least its as easy to like as it is to forget. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Adam Sandler pats his own back for being loyal in Grown Ups 2 an excuse for the star to hang out with his friends while he plays a Hollywood bigwig whos celebrated for moving back home so he can hang out with his friends. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Like its 2010 predecessor Dennis Dugans comedy has no real plot to speak of instead pretending to care about schlubs played by Sandler Kevin James Chris Rock and David Spade dealing with adult issues--Sandler is unprepared for wife Salma Hayeks pregnancy; Spade meets the son he never knew; Rock frets over his daughter dating--while really focusing on a series of random goofing-off incidents involving ogling sexy dance teachers getting peed on by angry deer and discharging ""burp snarts"" (a burp-sneeze-fart combo). Endless cameos from Sandler pals and cursory conflict with local frat boys pad out the proceedings before the finales de rigueur 80s-themed costume-party climax. A few decent one-liners notwithstanding the movie comes off as willfully uninspired to the point that Sandler joking about the only-in-the-movies implausibility of his character being married to out-of-his-league Hayek comes off not as clever self-consciousness but as an admission that hes too lazy to even pretend this is something other than self-congratulatory fantasy.Film Details Grown Ups 2 RatingPG-13 GenreComedy Running Time101 More Info Trailer See Also Adam Sandlers Laziness Why Nothing Changes in Movie After MovieFollow VoiceFilmClub Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Nick Schager Follow nschager Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

The first scene in ""Grown Ups 2"" depicts a deer urinating directly onto Adam Sandlers face. The penultimate scene (spoiler alert) depicts the very same deer apparently castrating Taylor Lautner. These bookends are not only the films highlights they also represent the closest it comes to establishing any sort of narrative throughline. Among the slackest laziest least movie-like movies released by a major studio in the last decade ""Grown Ups 2"" is perhaps the closest Hollywood has yet come to making ""Ow My Balls"" seem like a plausible future project. It is all but guaranteed a strong opening weekend.This story first appeared in the July 16 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. A follow-up to 2010s critically savaged yet massively lucrative ""Grown Ups"" this sequel introduces a few changes. Most obviously although Dennis Dugan is back in the directors chair and stars Sandler Kevin James Chris Rock and David Spade all reprise their roles as high-school buddies turned over-the-hill dads Rob Schneider is mysteriously missing. But more importantly while ""Grown Ups"" made some often cringeworthy attempts to shoehorn maudlin life lessons and character arcs into all the crotch smashing this sequel barely attempts to function as a piece of narrative filmmaking at all almost immediately devolving into a hash of frantic random incidents strung together with the slimmest sliver of coherence. Like ""Mrs. Dalloway"" and ""Ulysses"" ""Grown Ups 2"" unfolds entirely within the span of a single day; in this case the last day of school in a small Massachusetts town. Like ""Ulysses"" -- though unlike ""Mrs. Dalloway"" -- it features plentiful flatulence and James Joyce might well have appreciated the neologism ""burpsnart"" which describes Kevin James characters ability to burp sneeze and fart simultaneously. Whether he would have appreciated seeing this trick repeated no less than five times is an enigma for the ages though the sheer amount of pissing vomiting ear picking crotch sniffing man-on-dog tongue kissing and belly-button lint eating that the film contains would surely push anyone over the edge. The cast is massive -- in addition to a cross-section of Sandlers former ""Saturday Night Live"" compatriots Lautner Shaquille ONeal and Steve Austin are among the newcomers -- and rather than attempt to construct intersecting plotlines that involve all these thesps the script (by Sandler Fred Wolf and Tim Herlihy) instead simply doles out a single task for each character to accomplish (ask the girl out avoid the bully bond with the long-lost son etc.) the vast majority of which are forgotten as soon as theyre introduced. As bad as it is at tying up loose ends the film is even worse at laying groundwork. In one scene the central foursome come across a giant tire and with no attempt at explanation or reasonable comedic setup Spade is simply thrust inside and sent rolling through town because thats what grown men do when they find a giant tire. SEE ALSO Adam Sandler Gets Chatty at Grown Ups 2 Premiere There are some mercies however. Befitting Sandlers personal reputation as a mensch most of the actors seem to have had a good time onset. And while Sandlers films usually feature wall-to-wall product placement ""Grown Ups 2s"" brand-whoring is constrained to a single -- albeit seemingly endless -- scene set prominently inside a K-Mart. The film also avoids some of the misanthropy and borderline racism that has emerged in so many recent Sandler projects although a female bodybuilder comes in for some bizarrely elongated and repeated abuse and never with more wit than the moment in which Maya Rudolphs character randomly points at her and yells ""Shes got a penis."" While the film is hardly distinguished by any of its craft elements its never nearly as ugly as it is stupid. Film Review Grown Ups 2Reviewed at AMC Century City 15 Los Angeles July 10 2013.

Terrence Linder says July 17 2013 at 535 pm BecauseJoseSony gave them all huge paychecks Even they know(the stars of this crap) how awful this movie is Reply Jose says July 17 2013 at 503 pm This movie has got to be one of the worst I have seen in recent times considering the actors who star in it. I actually felt embarrassed for Adam Selma and crew...not sure why they accepted to take the roles. Please save yourself the money and the agony of sitting through 100 minutes of stupidity they should have stopped at the first Grown Ups. There is stupid funny and there is stupid funny....here they just rambled off and it got boring. Reply Karl says July 15 2013 at 641 am Honestly Andrew and many who have posted seem to have alot of pinned up emotion which could easly be relieved through various means. But ripping on Adam Sandler is like ripping on Charlie Chaplin and his slap stick comedies. Does Adam every portray himself as some great insightful director/producer? I do not think so...he simply is doing slap stick with a bunch of guys in a Saturday night style. Andrew if you are really some sort of genius when it comes to the creation of great comedic creation go forth in the world and create foool Reply Dale says July 15 2013 at 406 am Andrew you wouldnt know a good comedy if it slapped you in the face your an idiot. Grown Ups 2 was one of the funnest movies this year. Reply Travis Sheveland says July 13 2013 at 755 am If you dont go in expecting an academy award performance expect "" cheese "" and humor reminiscent of "" meatballs "" or any other old 80s comedy before we all got so critical and just wanted to have fun  it is a multitude of laughs and chuckles. Dumb... Yes But most know that going in  Its a no thought required bunch of laughs and we all need that occasionally too. We enjoyed it  Reply uhhuh says July 12 2013 at 246 am props for ripping this to shreds...Sandler needs to stop making movies. Reply Rotten says July 11 2013 at 1258 pm This movie currently is at 0% on rotten tomatoes. Ive never seen such failure Total cash grab of a movie Reply The Kingslayer says July 11 2013 at 1240 pm Why pay when you can just use Google for that? Reply Terrence Linder says July 11 2013 at 1227 pm You actually think this movie is funny? You must be as brainless as Adam sanderChris rock and maya Rudolph combined Reply The Kingslayer says July 11 2013 at 921 am I hope to god people have the sense to see Pacific Rim and not this pile of manure. Reply Lew says July 11 2013 at 910 am And they say the Lone Ranger is an example of whats wrong with Hollywood. While I agree with that observation Sandler is another example. While his movies cost relatively little compared to flop blockbusters they bring in the bucks-which is all the movies seem to be interested in. Sandler brings in the bucks by appealing to the lowest brow elements of the public who are willing to spend money on garbage. His movies do nothing to enhance film comedy. His movies show no respect for the audiences intelligence (which he may have gauged correctly). They make some people laugh by shock value that is good for a momentary response. Some things are not funny after their first time. He is not even in the same category as the 3 Stooges Laurel amp; Hardy Abbott amp; Costello Jerry Lewis or Mel Brooks etc. all whom used slapstick. Sandlers brand of slapstick is gross ugly and mean. It wont stand the test of time as do the work of these earlier comics and will eventually wear thin. The older Sandler gets the less able he""ll be to make this garbage. The problem is hell probably have influenced future filmmakers to dumb things down even further...if thats possible. Between the overblown messes of the Lone Ranger John Carter Battleship Man of Steel and their like and the garbage that Sandler cranks out is it any wonder that the movie industry finds itself in trouble. Reply cadavra says July 11 2013 at 955 am Actually his films are not cheap; the budgets routinely hit 90 million or more which is inexcusable for films without costly visual effects or elaborate sets and costumes.

The best that can be said for this who-asked-for-it sequel to the 2010 comedy is that Rob Schneider did not return. As for the rest of the cast -- led by Adam Sandler Kevin James Chris Rock and David Spade -- they are comedically outgunned by an inflatable raft that literally pops up in two scenes. Also read Pacific Rim Review There Be Monsters in Here Somewhere At least the raft gag is mildly amusing; all the other leaden moronic terrible jokes that ""Grown Ups 2"" has to offer get repeated three four five times in the desperate hope that one of them will become funny. Yes its time for another visit to the Adam Sandler Death-of-Cinema Fun Factory the big-screen version of a terrible sitcom where laugh tracks are replaced by the co-stars chuckling at their own awful material. Its the first day of summer and the lifelong chums of the first film are all facing the mildest of quandaries that in true sitcom fashion all come to mildly satisfactory conclusions. Retired Hollywood agent Lenny (Sandler) is enjoying life and is disconcerted that his wife Roxanne (Salma Hayek) wants to have another baby. Also read Bombs Away Hollywood Braces for Historic 4 Straight Weeks of Megaflops Kurt (Rock) exults over the get-out-of-jail free card he gets when wife Deanne (Maya Rudolph) forgets their 20th anniversary and Eric (James) hides his other woman from his own spouse Sally (Maria Bello) -- namely Erics mom (Georgia Engel) with whom he has a daily appointment for snacks and soap operas. Oh and Marcus (David Spade) gets a visit from the son (Alexander Ludwig) he never knew he had. And since none of this really adds up to a plot we get a wispy story about the guys running afoul of a bunch of arrogant local frat boys (whose leaders are played by MIlo Ventimiglia and an uncredited Taylor Lautner). Granted no one is going to ""Grown Ups 2"" for the plot but the jokes here are asinine immature offensive to women and to almost everyone else on the planet who isnt a middle-aged heterosexual male. And thats not even counting the continuing presence of Nick Swardson. Also read Turbo Review Going Where Many Other Toons Have Gone Before Sandler and his director longtime co-conspirator Dennis Dugan once again try to have it both ways balancing the gross (the movie literally opens with a deer urinating all over Sandler) and the grossly sentimental (Sandler just cant keep himself from delivering at least one oogie-woogie-snoogums homily about family life). One minute we get our heroes ogling busty women (with everything but a Tex Avery ""a-ROOOO-gah"" sound effect thrown in) and the next we get parents arguing about whos going to change the poopy diaper. As with the entire Sandler-Dugan filmography ""Grown Ups 2"" is hackneyed overlong blisteringly stupid and a waste of everyones time. If there must be a ""Grown Ups 3"" let it star the raft. Or hell even the poopy diaper. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

TWITTER Adam Sandler and company (minus Rob Schneider) return to show just how immature middle-aged dads can be. It would be dishonest to call Grown Ups 2 the most repellent high-profile comedy in recent memory. But thats largely because few moviegoers have memories kind enough to have already erased 2010s Grown Ups -- which offered almost every loathsome quality of this installment plus Rob Schneider. A water-treading rehash even on its own terms the sequel is unlikely to attract an audience to match that of the first film which was one of the biggest (if least-deserving) hits of co-writer/co-producer/co-star Adam Sandlers career. (Both films are directed by Dennis Dugan who owes his career to Sandlers patronage.) Sandler returns as Lenny a Hollywood player who since the first film has moved his family to his rural hometown where the kids can bike to school and Dad gets plenty of Guy Time with pals Eric (Kevin James) Kurt (Chris Rock) and Marcus (David Spade). Happily this films conception of male friendship is less reliant on insults and abuse than its predecessor and doesnt need to paint the mens wives as shrews in order to give the motley bunch something in common. PHOTOS 26 of Summers Most Anticipated Movies Which is not at all to say that the humor has matured. The opening scene in which a deer wanders into Lennys house offers two separate occasions where the beast rears back on hind legs to urinate on someone; the second goes on long enough to suggest someone has a fetish to indulge. Throughout gags are cartoonishly broad and afforded so little time for setup and delivery we seem to be watching less a story than a catalog of tossed-out material. Set on the last day of school the script follows as Lenny commandeers his kids bus (the driver played by Nick Swardson is high on pills) and after dropping them and their schoolmates off makes a day of it with his hooky-playing pals. Together they pioneer new bodily functions (Erics ""burp-snarting"" which may sound more amusing than it is) and fantasize about those they dont get enough of Attending their daughters dance rehearsal they cant stop gawking at an educator the credits helpfully dub Hot Dance Teacher. Soon the fellows are trying to make old bodies do what young ones never did. Visiting a favorite swimming hole so Eric can dive off the cliff he always feared they cross paths with a band of frat boys (led by Taylor Lautner) whose collective loutishness makes Sandler amp; Co. look like Knights of the Round Table. A rivalry is born though the adults dont know theyre being targeted for destruction. Instead they spontaneously decide to throw an 80s-themed yard party and in a couple of hours half the town arrives in costumes that would have taken a week to assemble. PHOTOS From Fat to Fit 8 Funnymen Who Trimmed Down Like the first film this one is built upon the seriously misguided idea that five or 10 minutes of sentimental family-values talk can coexist with an hour and a half of burp-snarting and the like. Here Lenny must contend with the news that his wife (Salma Hayek) wants to have a fourth child; Eric inexplicably must keep his wife (Maria Bello) in the dark about how much time he spends keeping his elderly mother company; Marcus must make peace with the thuggish son he never knew he sired; and Kurt ... well Chris Rock gets to ad-lib one or two funny lines and spend the rest of the film waiting for something better to come along. Sandler whose best work tends to be his least rewarded at the box office has never before made a sequel. (One could argue of course that his early hits were the same movie in different clothes.) That he would make an exception for Grown Ups says nothing good about his trajectory as an artist -- at this point even combining those five words may provoke snickers. He and Rock more than their co-stars may yet have good movies in them about embracing adult responsibilities after years of playing the fool. But Grown Ups 2 and a dozen other half-hearted productions suggest they wont succeed with such statements while theyre trying to succeed commercially.
