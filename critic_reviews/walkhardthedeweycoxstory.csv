Covering Deweys myriad artistic reinventions and subsequent lapses into drugs adultery and light entertainment the films relative strengths and weaknesses are captured in a scene in which seeking spiritual guidance he heads to India and bumps into The Beatles. Their ridiculous facial hair ludicrous accents and internal bickering are funny for about 30 seconds but director Jake Kasdan has no idea when to shout Cut. Similarly as he has proved in other supporting roles a little Reilly goes a long way and 96 minutes in his childlike discombobulated presence isnt the joyful experience that many would perhaps expect. Hes suitably daft in the title role but his performance suffers from being almost identical in tone and nuance to that of his Talladega Nights cohort Will Ferrell; theres even a scene where he lollops down a street in a pair of oversized Y-fronts wigged out on acid (the Ferrell trademark).The one area where Walk Hard does manage to hold its own against classics of the genre such as This is Spinal Tap or Sweet and Lowdown is the music all of which is expertly written and performed and comes as sweet relief from the bawdy depths that the remainder of the film frequently chooses to plumb.

By David Denby Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman in Rob Reiners ""The Bucket List.""   Credit BARRY BLITT The holidays are over and its time to sweep up the sticky pine needles cracked ornaments and occasional twirled bits of pretty ribbon that have gathered under the tree. ""The Bucket List"" a comedy about two terminal-cancer patients living it up severely tests ones critical compassion. I know Im not a good enough person to pass the test but Im not sure anyone else is either. (Todd McCarthy in Variety called the movie "" Ikiru for meatheads."") ""The Bucket List"" which was written by Justin Zackham and directed by Rob Reiner seems to have been created by applying algorithms to sentiment. Jack Nicholson plays a crass and rancorous billionaire and Morgan Freeman an intellectual who was forced by family obligations to become an auto mechanic. Nicholson is bulge-eyed heavy-bellied and super-emphatic; Freeman is wise baritonal and eloquent. I omit the character names because the two stars are doing what theyve done a great deal of recently and theyre drawing on the audiences feelings for them. The picture might have been better if the filmmakers had played around with the actors a bit--reversed the roles for instance so that Nicholson rather than Freeman unfurled the fortune-cookie wisdom about bringing joy to other people before you die and Freeman rather than Nicholson snarled that money is the only thing that matters in a rotten world. But no such luck Reiners Hollywood heart is too pure for mischief. After some fairly grim scenes at a Los Angeles hospital where the men meet ""The Bucket List"" turns into a globe-trotting tour disguised as a search for enlightenment. Determined to find what is missing in their lives the two geezers write down a series of wild-and-crazy things to do using Nicholsons money. Cheeks flattened by the wind they jump out of airplanes. On an empty racetrack they play bumper cars with a pair of Shelby GT350s. They visit the glamour spots--the Himalayas Hong Kong the pyramids the South of France the Taj Mahal and the African savanna where the terrain bursts with enough digital zebras to freeze a supercomputer. In general the light is golden the mood technologically sublime the actuality of the experience a dead zero. Reiner does a few things with a sure hand. The two men warm to each other slowly and Reiner manages the stages of friendship--mutual indifference changing into ironical tolerance then into irritated appreciation and finally into dependence--with psychologically acute detail. Nicholsons character is estranged from his daughter Freemans from his wife and each takes a turn persuading the other to set things right an interference that gives the actors a chance to display a little temper. These blowups which make an instructive contrast in acting styles are the most entertaining thing in the movie. Both men are seventy but Freeman seems to be handling age with greater ease. He is tall and straight and when his eyes blaze and his voice hardens hes still the most commanding actor in Hollywood. As Nicholson does his neck-jutting rage his acquired bulk swerves and spills with alarming violence. ""The Bucket List"" will quickly be kicked into oblivion but at a lifetime-achievement-award ceremony Nicholsons tempest will fit nicely into a montage of Crazy Jack moments. If youre curious about pride in old age and want to see something more literate than ""The Bucket List"" you might drop in on the recent independent movie ""Starting Out in the Evening"" in which Frank Langella plays with formidable dignity a once famous writer named Leonard Schiller. A man in his seventies who knows what he knows and has little interest in learning much more Schiller lives in a funereal apartment on the Upper West Side. Amid dark-stained bookcases he pecks away at a novel on a typewriter and tries to fend off an ambitious and needy female graduate student (Lauren Ambrose) who wants to revive both his career and his sex life. The director Andrew Wagner depicts Schillers relations with the student and also with his wayward daughter (Lili Taylor) with some delicacy--perhaps too much delicacy. Schiller is meant to be a survivor of the New York Jewish literary renaissance of the nineteen-fifties and sixties but the movie for all its considerable intelligence dries out his temperament too much. Anyone who remembers that vanished tribe of New Yorkers knows that even in their later years they made a joke now and then and were given to malice and desire as well as to bouts of intellectual severity. After a while Schillers austere ironies wilt ones respect for him. Langella is superb and ""Starting Out in the Evening"" is a classy film--I never thought I would hear the phrase ""Trilling Howe and especially Edmund Wilson"" uttered in a movie theatre--but it could have used a little less circumspection a little more juice. John Sayless ""Honeydripper"" is a good movie for a dark icy day. Its set in rural Alabama in 1950 at harvest time and the cotton fields and the red-leafed trees as photographed by Dick Pope appear lustrous and warming. Like some of Sayless earlier films--""Passion Fish"" and ""Sunshine State"" in particular--""Honeydripper"" is at its best when the characters sit around dither and ruminate. Moviemaking seems to have become almost magically easy for this independent writer-director. He builds a detailed atmosphere brings his good people and his bad together and lets them jabber at one another; the virtuosity is rhetorical rather than visual. Often not much happens--at least not in conventional terms. In ""Honeydripper"" Stacy Keach plays a racist sheriff who more or less runs the small town of Harmony. The sheriff is powerless though in the most important way. He lacks music. The center of the movie is an old bare wood-plank jazz club the Honeydripper Lounge situated near the cotton fields and presided over by Pine Top Purvis (Danny Glover) a retired boogie-woogie piano player who is running out of cash. His club is almost dead (the crowds have gone to hear the jukebox at an adjoining establishment) so Pine Top engages Guitar Sam a famous jazz musician from New Orleans. (Sayles has said that any similarities to the real-life Pinetop Perkins and Guitar Slim are merely incidental.) When the genius doesnt show Pine Top substitutes a young wanderer (Gary Clark Jr.) who miraculously brings the place alive with his electric guitar. ""Honeydripper"" is a fable of musical rebirth complete with a blind angel (Keb Mo) who sits on the street playing the blues and making witty remarks. Its the gentlest movie imaginable but in its own way it covers a lot of ground. In a long monologue that Danny Glover delivers in an impassioned whisper Pine Top imagines the first slave to sit down at a piano in the masters house--a shackled man who realizes that he could attain power by making music. Pine Tops reminiscences include his youth in the jazz clubs of New Orleans. In the course of the movie an elderly blues singer (Mable John) working at the Honeydripper performs her last set and theres also a local church choir which backs up a pastors chanted invocations of Jesus saving power. By the time the young guitarist begins playing and singing we realize that we have progressed through the entire history of black music and arrived at something new. Sayless modest manner conceals a major claim in ""Honeydripper"" in that tiny club he has created his version of the birth of rock and roll. None less than the Beatles turn up in Jake Kasdans ""Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story."" The movie written by Kasdan and Judd Apatow is an uneven spoof of music bio-pics (especially ""Walk the Line"") with John C. Reilly playing a hapless dolt who rises to the top by imitating every popular style at exactly the right moment from Elvis to the Fab Four to Dylan. Dewey encounters the Beatles in India dropping acid and sitting in the lotus position with the Maharishi. Jack Black (Paul McCartney) Paul Rudd (John Lennon) Justin Long (George Harrison) and Jason Schwartzman (Ringo Starr) do Liverpudlian with hilarious brio--its just a single scene but its the funniest thing in the movie. Apart from Christopher Guests mock documentaries (""This Is Spinal Tap"" ""A Mighty Wind"") parody of a tired genre probably works best as a sketch. ""Walk Hard"" runs down quickly and suffers further from having the wide-eyed and weightless Reilly as its star. Although hes a fine character actor Reilly is not charismatic or funny enough to hold the picture together so one waits for the few good bits. Bob Dylan fans will be amused by the cryptic strangled poetry of the lyrics for the Dylan-style song that Dewey sings but such jokes as having three black-bearded men named LChaim Mazel Tov and Schmendrick turn up as Deweys managers may have cracked up a script conference but do no more than lightly amuse the audience. And the same is true for an orgy scene including a penis an organ that Apatow in recent interviews has vowed to bring into mainstream film-making. Well there it is and the truth is that after the surprise of its first appearance the member doesnt bring all that much to the party.

One type ends with a plane crash (to contrast the mortality of man with the immortality of song). The second ends with a drug overdose (to slam home the moral of how creation and destruction are flip sides of the LP of life). The third ends with a post-rehab career rebound (all the better to applaud the unkillable artistic spirit). The clump of cinematic silly putty called Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story spoofs the conventions of all three as it follows its musical shape-shifter (John C. Reilly) from rockabilly goat to folkie troubadour to rock dinosaur. While it might not have the laughs-per-minute ratio of the Naked Gun movies (but then what does?) it is a reliable titter generator for boomers and their echo boomlings. Like a musical Zelig or Forrest Gump Dewey Cox (whose surname is stroked for every naughty pun imaginable) for five decades is at the center of the hurricane that is pop music mastering every idiom from rock to rap. As a boy Dewey loses his musically gifted older brother in a freak accident that inspires his fathers grumpy refrain ""The wrong kid died."" Which in turn inspires Dewey the living less-loved child to prove himself to Pop. Dewey starts out as a heartbeat-skipping teen crooner goes rockabilly and feels a whole lotta shaking going on then like a rolling stone morphs into a protest poet. He radiates bad vibrations as a reclusive pop guru loses his way in an octopus garden when he goes psychedelic and finds his heart of gold when he gets inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Which is another way of saying that Dewey Cox plays like a Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour skit extended to feature length a parade of shaggy wigs and shagalicious fashions. Written by Jake Kasdan and Judd Apatow evidently after two too many viewings of Walk the Line the film offers puckish Reilly who rode shotgun in Talladega Nights and Chicago an opportunity to drive his own vehicle. Reilly is recklessly funny. But Dewey is a better showcase for toupees and trousers than for his singular talents. Jenna Fischer scores smiles as Darlene the puritanical hottie who sings backup for Dewey. Likewise Tim Meadows as Deweys drummer ever ahead of the curve when it comes to the happening drug of the moment. Big laughs? More like big smiles. Most of which rely on a knowledge of rock history. As a tousle-haired troubadour of the Dylan school Dewey fulminates something to the effect of ""My sense of taste is wasted on the phosphorous and orange peels of San Franciscos ax-encrusted frenzy. So let me touch you."" As a bearded-whale mad genius of the Brian Wilson stripe Dewey snaps ""Open your mind and learn to play the effing theremin"" I will Dewey if you open your heart and let John C. Reilly out.

Why? Cox rocks. This rowdy spoof of music biopics is silly fun and often hilarious. And its great to see John C. Reilly who plays Dewey pull off a starring role. A talented comic and dramatic actor who proved he could sing in Chicago (his Mr. Cellophane was pitch-perfect) Reilly is ideal in the role. Reilly ably parodies a range of distinctive styles from Bob Dylan to Buddy Holly to Brian Wilson. Walk Hard begins by specifically mocking Walk the Line the 2005 Johnny Cash biopic then expands into a more wide-ranging satire of musical and pop culture cliches and lampoons the thematic conventions of the biopic genre. Of course its all about sex drugs and rock n roll and as written by director Jake Kasdan (The TV Set) and Judd Apatow (Knocked Up) its all done with raucous good humor. The segment featuring Dewey with The Beatles played by Jack Black Paul Rudd Justin Long and Jason Schwartzman is one of the funniest in the film. Walk Hard follows the rise and fall of Dewey Cox a fictional musician who got his start in the 1950s. He starts off with simple values but goes far astray becoming a bigamist collecting giraffes chimps and famous friends and getting addicted to virtually every known drug. A star is born crashes burns falls into near-obscurity and then hosts a bad TV show. Along the way he finds love with his backup singer Darlene (Jenna Fischer). The movie opens strongly with young Dewey and his brother Nate their fathers favorite playing innocently. Then Dewey accidentally slices his brother in half with a machete and his lifelong trauma kicks into gear. Deweys father (Raymond J. Barry) holds it against his son and reminds him for decades that ""the wrong kid died."" The next scene shows us Dewey in high school at 14 (portrayed by the fortysomething Reilly). He marries his 12-year-old sweetheart Beth Anne (Kristen Wiig the thirtysomething comedian from SNL). But its the songs that make for the biggest laughs. Royal Jelly features Reilly aping Dylans nasal twang and his arcane lyrics. Walk Hard is exuberant and fun. Though it occasionally wanders off course it never gets boring. And best of all the music is surprisingly catchy the lyrics inventively funny. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Reader Editor Brent Jones.

Reilly in Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME Machetes are not something you expect to find on hard-scrabble southern farms. But there they inexplicably are and the adorable little Cox brothers are in the habit of fencing with them on soft-focus summer days -- until accidentally Dewey cuts his saintly sibling in two with his blade. There you have it the utterly improbable central trauma that ""explains"" the rest of Deweys life his drive for the fame that can never compensate for his terrible guilt the self-destructive drinking drugging and sexual outlawry that sully his path to pop icon status the bum musical trips -- his adored brother may have been an authentic musical prodigy that Dewey dimly needs to emulate -- that threaten his career. Youve been here before of course with Walk the Line and Ray to name only the most recent biopics about the trials and triumphs of pop-music icons. These movies ritualistically recycling their subjects most famous hits and their more infamous falls from behavioral grace provide the last sentimental postscripts to their subjects celebrity arcs. They have for years deserved parody and Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story is that long-awaited -- by me at least -- of comic commentary on breathless mythomania. Not since This is Spinal Tap have I had such a good time watching amiable idiocy stumble on toward uncertain glory. Oh the troubles this movie recounts The first wife who contemptuously refuses to believe in Deweys dream the second wife who endlessly rebuffs his sexual blandishments the trips up musical blind alleys (its almost worth the price of admission to watch Dewey during his Bob Dylan and Beatles phases). And that says nothing about the ways inspirations for his songs strike him. Somebody says something commonplace within his hearing we see a dim gleam of recognition in his eye and -- bam -- the next thing we know his band is playing the song featuring the overheard phrase while a montage shows it rising on the charts. As it is in allegedly authentic biopics so it is in this send-up. There is no effort or intentionality in Deweys story. He writes songs the same way he gets girls -- by standing around and looking receptive. We are to understand him as the pure product of the pure prisoner of his ""genius."" Which is why of course he is totally unable to cope with celebrity. He has no core convictions to fall back on only addled appetites to satisfy. The film is co-written by Judd Apatow (The 40-Year-Old Virgin Knocked Up) who can do no wrong in Hollywood right now and Jake Kasdan who also directs with a light and glancing hand. They are good-natured lads -- smart but not mean-spirited -- and richly blessed by the presence of John C. Reilly in the title role. Theres an almost pre-moral innocence about his soft and squishy mug a heedless exuberance in his playing. Hes happy to play dumb -- allowing Dewey to live profitably within the unexamined premises the mythic fatuity of his media-driven myth. Like the other films Apatow has been involved with Walk Hard is a clever blend of very broad occasionally raunchy gag-smithing and an unspoken yet palpable social shrewdness. For the moment at least this guy is somehow plugged into our half-formed half-subversive thoughts. Walk Hard is actually talking about -- well all right goofily alluding to -- serious issues though its creators would I suspect rather die than admit that. Thats all right with me. But I do think Walk Hard is a rather more dubious box office proposition than something like Knocked Up. Satire is ever a tough sell to the populist audience which prefers sentiments of a more uplifting kind while the crowd that might get a kick out of this film it will likely dismiss it as kid stuff. But call me a cynic call me a curmudgeon call me perverse -- I loved every moment of Dewey Coxs story. I hope Im not alone in that feeling.

"Walk Hard Raunch and roll | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesWalk Hard Raunch and roll Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story is old-school parody and by that I mean really old school.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Dec. 21 2007 Starring John C. Reilly Jenna Fischer Kristen Wiig and Tim Meadows. Directed by Jake Kasdan. 96 minutes. At major theatres. 14A  Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story is old-school parody and by that I mean really old school.Article Continued BelowAll the way back to Grade 4 fondly remembered as a time when anyone possessing XY chromosomes could spend an entire afternoon snickering about a surname like ""Cox."" All while anyone possessing XX chromosomes looked on in disgust and wonder.Its like that here. The juvenile humour in Walk Hard isnt of the same calibre as Knocked Up and Superbad the other recent issues from the Judd Apatow hit factory. That could be because director Jake Kasdan who co-wrote the script with Apatow is content to simply track and mock the earnest Hicksville-to-Hitsville trajectory of music biopics like Walk the Line Ray and Beyond the Sea the three chief influences.Dead horses arent just flogged theyre set on fire and dragged to the glue factory. When Kasdan and Apatow need a break from their endless conjugations of ""Cox"" - and that includes the visual pun of an eye-popping full-frontal male crotch shot - they shift to a running gag about rockabilly star Dewey Coxs inability to just say ""no"" to drugs. He also has an unfortunate habit of slicing people in half with a machete.But Dewey is played by John C. Reilly an inspired choice in that hes up to the job of playing Cox from a teenager right up to a grandfather and he does so with deadpan precision. Hes also pretty handy with a guitar and a tune as anyone would know who had heard him sing in Prairie Home Companion Chicago and even Magnolia.The trouble is that its hard to maintain momentum in a parody like this because youre walking in the footsteps of a genre that is pretty ridiculous to begin with. For instance the duelling wives tension between Deweys first wife Edith (Kristen Wiig) and the come-hither hussy Darlene (Jenna Fischer from TVs The Office) isnt that far removed from the battling femmes of Walk the Line or from Johnny Cashs real-life family drama for that matter.When the jokes work they rock -such as when Dewey travels to India and walks into an ego-driven encounter with John Paul George and Ringo (played by Paul Rudd Jack Black Justin Long and Jason Schwartzman). Those four could make a great Beatles parody if The Rutles hadnt already beaten them to it.Music fans will also enjoy the cameos by Lyle Lovett Jewel Ghostface Killah Eddie Vedder and Jack White all who are more than willing to flail the hide of the pompous pop beast. All hail Spinal TapWalk Hard is the kind of movie that you want to love and not just like but liking it is good enough. And its one that I grow fonder of the more I think about it judging by how often I find myself singing the title tune and the very rude yet very funny ""Lets Duet.""Anyone who doesnt at least crack a smile when they hear that song probably skipped Grade 4.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Reilly star in ""Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story."" Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story. (R) Columbia (92 min.) Directed by Jake Kasdan. With John C. Reilly Jenna Fischer Tim Meadows. Opens Friday at theaters throughout New Jersey. TWO AND A HALF STARS Judd Apatow has a colon problem. He produced ""Anchorman The Legend of Ron Burgundy."" He produced ""Talladega Nights The Ballad of Ricky Bobby."" And now hes produced ""Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story."" All movies with lumpy stars crude jokes lots of guest stars and easy targets -- TV anchormen stock-car racers the music business. And none quite as funny as the movies he actually writes and directs himself like ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up."" But Apatow is both busy and loyal so hes not only produced and co-written this one hes given it to long-time friend Jake Kasdan to direct. Apatow stock-company players like Paul Rudd and Jonah Hill show up in small roles and John C. Reilly stars as the musical hero. The idea is to collect every musical biopic cliche there is -- then exaggerate them to the point of absurdity. So theres a childhood trauma (involving a machete) and a disability (Dewey has no sense of smell). Theres a hit record affairs drug problems and famous friends (with Jack Black of all people playing a Maharishi-era Paul McCartney). This is all fine as a start and the movies at its best when making fun of rock movies themselves. So the fortysomething Reilly begins the film playing a 14-year-old; Rudd who plays John Lennon uses a Liverpudlian accent so awful hes unintelligible. There are bursts of deliberately over-the-top melodrama and painfully ugly costuming. And that all works occasionally. What doesnt work is the film as a whole. Apatow has always told loose and improvisational stories but the work hes done here with Kasdan just feels lazy and unfinished. Ultra-Orthodox Jews with long beards are always good for a laugh it assumes; so is having a naked man wander into the frame or just saying the heros name. Wrong. All comedy is hard but satire is particularly tricky; the reason ""Blazing Saddles"" worked was that it both understood the genre it was ridiculing and remained willing to throw it aside for a killer gag. ""Dewey"" doesnt have that kind of control. Wheres Mel Brooks when you need him? (Oh thats right -- getting more than 400 a ticket on Broadway.) Reilly is fine as Cox -- he has a strong voice and hes not afraid to put on a thong and run down the middle of a brightly lit street although he should be. (Worse though is an ill-advised beard which makes him look like one of the Geico cavemen). Jenna Fischer is both sexy and silly as Deweys second wife and Tim Meadows a genial and generally underused performer gets plenty of mileage out of Deweys druggie drummer. As amiably untucked as its star ""Dewey Cox"" is a sloppy shambling mess of a movie that just wants to be liked. And there are things here to smile at and even a few good laughs. But youll laugh longer -- and like this movie better -- if you spend a couple of dollars to rent it in a few months instead of spending 11 to see it now. To put it in terms even Dewey would understand its got a few decent tracks -- but its headed straight for the cut-out bin. Rating note The film contains nudity sexual situations drug abuse comic violence and strong language. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

WE DO By Lou Lumenick View author archive email the author follow on twitter Get author RSS feed Name(required) Email(required) Comment(required) December 21 2007 | 1000am PERENNIAL second banana John C. Reilly rocks as a hard-rocking decades-spanning musical icon in ""Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story"" though this biopic parody it self is a more scattershot affair. I loved both ""Walk the Line"" and ""Ray"" but it will be hard to watch either one with a straight face again after the skewering they get in this Judd Apatow production which quotes scene after scene to hilarious effect. Dewey is a good ol product of the 1940s South who kills his beloved older brother in a sword-fighting accident - one of many jokes repeated way past the point of diminishing returns - and who suddenly finds himself a rising musical star. Like Johnny Cash hes equipped with a disapproving ever-pregnant wife (Kristen Wiig) and a father (Raymond J. Barry) who loudly and repeatedly blames him for his brothers death. Like Cash and Ray Charles Dewey is turned onto ever-harder drugs by a bandmate (Tim Meadows) and is lured into bed by a succession of young women (and the occasional man). There are some wonderful musical parodies here particularly the classically suggestive duet that Dewey sings with the songbird (Jenna Fischer) who becomes his second wife ""In my dreams youre blowing me [long pause] . . . some kisses."" Also hilarious is a sequence featuring Dewey and The Beatles (Jack Black and Paul Rudd in cameos as a battling McCartney and Lennon) in India - complete with an animated LSD trip - and a Dewey sendup of an incoherent pretentious Bob Dylan tune that makes it hard to take ""Im Not There"" seriously as well. Apatow and his co-screenwriter/director Jake Kasdan (""Orange County"") get all the cliches of the genre right - the portentous dialogue the name-dropping references the bad-aging makeup even the overproduced recording sessions of the late 60s. Its too bad they didnt trust the audiences sophistication and padded the flick with gross-out jokes including repetition of the main characters surname many of which are repeated beyond endurance. And was it really necessary to give Reilly as many underwear scenes as Will Ferrell whom he supported in ""Talladega Nights The Ballad of Ricky Bobby""? Still in a season filled with so many feel-bad movies dont underestimate the appeal of something as silly as ""Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story."" WALK HARD THE DEWEY COX STORY  1/2Sketchy fun.Running time 96 minutes. Rated R (sex nudity drugs profanity). At the Empire the Orpheum the Chelsea others.

Reilly (c.) with Justin Long (l.) and Jason Schwartzman takes a magical mystery tour. BY Jack Mathews Thursday December 20 2007 847 PM Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story. Comedy parodying the movie biographies of Ray Charles and Johnny Cash. With John C. Reilly Jenna Fischer. Director Jake Kasdan (135). R Language drug use nudity/sexuality. At area theaters.The biographical parallels between Johnny Cash and Ray Charles in ""Walk the Line"" and ""Ray"" become the linchpins of writer-director Jake Kasdans irreverent benignly vulgar and generally hilarious ""Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story.""Starring the heretofore underrated John C. Reilly ""Walk Hard"" tells the life story of a poor boy from the South who guilt-ridden over the accidental slaying of his brother with a machete sets out as a teenager to make good in the dawning world of rock n roll. Its a long haul punctuated with groupies bad marriages drugs career ups and downs prison terms self-loathing destroyed hotel rooms and every other rock cliche that Kasdan and co-writer Judd Apatow (""Knocked Up"") could summon. This kind of parody is hard to sustain for an hour and a half and ""Walk Hard"" does gets wearying at times. But the humor is so outrageous the original music so much fun and Reilly so good - both while hamming it up in the role and in singing the songs - that its irresistible. Reilly is a musician and has sung in ""A Prairie Home Companion"" and ""Chicago."" But here he sings an albums worth sounding at times like Cash and at others like Roy Orbison. In Deweys folk-protest phase when hes being compared to Dylan Reilly does Dylan better than any of the actors in ""Im Not There."" ""Walk Hards"" wonderful soundtrack includes the title song which is a jape on Cashs ""I Walk the Line"" and a ballad called ""A Beautiful Ride"" that should be up for an Oscar. Through its arc ""Walk Hard"" serves as a summary of the historical shifts in rock n roll from its blues background through Elvis rockabilly the British Invasion electronic punk and the inevitable oldies-but-goodies reunion. The films able supporting cast includes Kristen Wiig as Deweys teenage bride Jenna Fischer as his long-suffering second wife and Raymond J. Barry as his estranged father who shows up periodically to remind Dewey that ""the wrong son died."" There are a few too many lazy jokes played off Deweys last name but not nearly enough to wipe that grin off your face. jmathewsnydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

The cookie-cutter cliches of ""Ray"" ""Great Balls of Fire"" and ""Walk the Line"" are ripe for mockery and writer-producer Judd Apatow star John C. Reilly and director Jake Kasdan eviscerate the genre gleefully. Reilly plays Dewey Cox a dimwitted superstar whom we follow from hardscrabble youth to his creaky antiquity at a lifetime achievement awards show. Deweys early days were marked by the kind of heartbreak that inevitably sparks musical greatness As a boy he accidentally cut his piano-prodigy brother in half with a machete. After promising his bisected bro to be good enough for two people he set off on a singing career that turned him into dozens Dewey at various points bears an uncanny resemblance to Buddy Holly Johnny Cash Brian Wilson and Bob Dylan. Reilly plays the part with sublime earnestness beneath a gallery of ridiculous wigs and beards as his career caroms from rockabilly through psychedelia and disco. The story follows the well-traveled route for such tales and Kasdan shoots it like a high-toned Oscar candidate. Dewey begins his journey as a last-minute fill-in at a black nightclub persuading the owner that he has learned the ailing stars routine by heart but not anticipating how hell sound singing ""Mama You Got to Love Your Negro Man."" His ever-pregnant skeptical wife Beth Anne (Kristen Wiig) provides plenty of static on the home front while he tours. His sultry singing partner (Jenna Fischer) suggests that more than their voices should entwine then primly pushes him away shocked that hed take her for that kind of girl. Dewey succumbs to the usual temptations -- setting up a cameo by the Temptations -- indulging in all manner of ribald drugged-up tomfoolery. All the while he remains somehow unaware that its not OK to act like the superhuman music god people tell him he is. When Beth Anne shouts ""Its against the law to be married to two people at the same time"" Dewey protests ""What about if if youre famous?"" As troubled times descend some of his band yearn for the happy early days only to be reminded ""That was early Cox this is middle period Cox"" while Dewey himself wails ""this sure is a hard period"" At every dramatic crescendo he charges into a bathroom yanks the sink from the wall and shatters it on the floor. When things get really rough he enters a public restroom and busts up several. WALK HARD 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for sexual content graphic nudity drug use and language. The cast is packed with familiar faces from Apatows acting troupe TV comedy and pop music. Jack White plays a mush-mouthed indecipherable Elvis Jack Black plays Paul McCartney and Eddie Vedder Ghostface Killah and Jewel play themselves. But this is entirely Reillys picture. He gives Dewey who is essentially a coat rack to hang jokes on an endearing sweetness and performs his own singing and guitar work on 33 original songs. If this rise to top billing marks the beginning of middle period Reilly it ought to be a swell period.

"Biopic spoof mocks around the clock - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsReal EstateLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsGames THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review Biopic spoof mocks around the clock John C. Reilly plays the title character in Jake Kasdans ""Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story."" (Lucas jackson/reuters) Email|Print| Text size - + By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / December 21 2007 The first 30 or so minutes of ""Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story"" condense the entire Hollywood biopic genre into a sweet chewable tablet. Its the Flintstones vitamin of spoofs. (However it is not recommended for actual Flintstones chewers.)In one of the opening scenes we see our tall gawky hero Dewford Cox (a great John C. Reilly) leaning against a wall. Hes got a minute before hes set to take the stage. But wait his drummer tells the stage manager Dewey has to go over his entire lifes story before he plays. And that scene melts back to the farm Dewey grew up on while the soundtrack pours mellifluous gospel moaning all over the pastoral imagery.The movie gives us the scarring family tragedy (""Im cut in half pretty bad"" says Deweys brother) the discovery of his early musical genius (he learns the blues in about two seconds) the ascent to fame the instantly dysfunctional marriage the introduction to drugs the luscious new wife the collapse (jail rehab) and the comeback. That the makers of ""Walk Hard"" - director Jake Kasdan wrote the movie with Judd Apatow - manage do all this in about half the time it takes to watch a ""Behind the Music"" is part of what makes it such a carbonated treat.Like the ""Scary Movie"" series ""Walk Hard"" is a comedy that doubles as obscene film criticism. The tired tropes and cliches of Hollywood music biography (about Jim Morrison Ray Charles Johnny Cash et al.) get beaned hard with a dodge ball. One of the best gags is that Reilly is already playing Dewey at age14. A year later comes this line to spouse one whose mantra is ""Give up your dreams"" ""I think Im doing all right for a 15-year-old with a wife and a baby""""Walk Hard"" is pure ""Weird Al"" Yankovic pop prank - impersonation that merges homage and disrespect into confection. This brisk bliss is short-lived though as Kasdan and Apatows ambition gets the best of them. Three or four awesome novelty singles strive to make up an album. But when is the last time you listened to an entire Weird Al record? In essence the movie becomes one of the fish in the barrel its shooting. This should be over in 35 minutes but goes on for another hour.There are gold nuggets strewn about those 60 minutes - like the vulgar crassly fused hip-hop mash-up that resuscitates old Deweys career (race is deftly toyed with). The cast is uniformly committed to the movies nonsense from the ""Saturday Night Live"" alums like Tim Meadows and Chris Parnell (these two need a show of their own) to current ""SNL"" player Kristen Wiig. Jenna Fischer - Pam from ""The Office"" - plays Deweys second wife. On TV she can seem self-doubtingly sad even when shes smiling. Here Fischer is very funny anyway both when her feet are in the air and when theyre kicking Dewey out of her life. Reilly meanwhile is like Will Ferrell with a vastly human third dimension.Even so fatigue sets in. Since ""Walk Hard"" is essentially lacking in drama the gags move laterally and they can stand more or less independent of each other. Its not building toward anything. So youre free to drift in and out if you please to make your own playlist of the movies greatest hits. Speaking of which Deweys songs are smart little rockabilly pop and country numbers that Apatow Kasdan and others wrote and that Reilly intones with hearty sincerity. The movie stays with you for about 10 minutes. The music though suggests that while Dewey Cox might have been a cartoon he was certainly an achy-breaky one.

Reilly plays hardest-working buffoon in rock n roll 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story Musical comedy. Starring John C. Reilly Jenna Fischer Raymond J. Barry and Kristen Wiig. Directed by Jake Kasdan. (R. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) Its just the way it is. Sometimes you cant wait to see an inspirational movie about a guy paralyzed from head to toe (""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"") or have an existential experience with a movie about a psychotic murderer (""No Country for Old Men""). And then there are other times when an odd impulse takes over and all you want to do is watch John C. Reilly freaking out down the street in his underwear playing a rock n roll idol on LSD. ""Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story"" is a joke machine and a nice change from the better but almost uniformly downbeat movies out there this season. A biopic satire its about nothing but its laughs. The songs may be good - well-made pastiches of various musical genres and eras - and John C. Reilly is wonderfully ridiculous as a lunkheaded music legend. But whenever the jokes begin to sag and fortunately thats not often the movie has no reason for being. Its no stand-alone piece of work either If you havent seen ""Walk the Line"" theres really no point in seeing this movie. But those caveats aside ""Walk Hard"" is 100 minutes of fun and for pure uncomplicated enjoyment its the movie to see right now. It could have grown tiresome after a half hour. It would have if ""Walk Hard"" only parodied the predictable story lines of pop music biopics. But Judd Apatow and director Jake Kasdan who collaborated on the screenplay go beyond that. They parody the actual strategies that filmmakers employ in telling these stories and their close attention to these lazy conventions provide them with a constant source of laughs. They take little things weve all seen many times and emphasize them into absurdity. For example whenever a famous real-life person is introduced into a biopic the screenwriters have to figure out a way to slip in the characters name so that audiences understand whos who. So here when Dewey meets Buddy Holly Hollys name is repeated several times. The same goes for when he meets Elvis and later at the dawn of his LSD phase the Beatles. The names are repeated over and over so that absolutely no one can miss them. Another convention sent up is the bathroom crack-up scene in which the rock legend upon receiving some distressing news takes it out on a bathroom sink. In real life it generally doesnt occur to people to rip out plumbing when they feel sad but we know from movies that thats exactly what rock legends do. In ""Walk Hard"" Dewey Cox rips out about a dozen bathroom sinks and it gets funnier each time. The story is told as a long flashback as Dewey contemplates his life before going onstage for a tribute concert. Like Johnny Cash and Ray Charles Dewey had a brother when he was a boy his fathers favorite and as soon as we see the brother we know That kid is dead. To emphasize this point the script has the brother talking about all the great things hes going to do with the limitless years he has ahead of him. Dewey moves from rockabilly to rock n roll has flirtations with punk and disco and has a full-blown protest period. His drugs change as his music changes. Theres an Elvis-type song a Roy Orbison-type song and most hysterically a Dylanesque number a folk ballad with nonsensical lyrics. Reilly does an excellent Dylan imitation and is a convincing singer throughout. He plays Dewey as a reckless child-man in search of the love he never got from his father (Raymond J. Barry) a harsh parent who never tires of saying ""The wrong kid died."" Reilly gets good comic support from the women in Deweys life. Kristen Wiigs role satirizes the thankless depictions of first wives in biopics. (""Im starting to believe you dont believe in me"" he tells her.) Jenna Fischer brings comedic precision and a sense of contained but ever-present mischief to Darlene as Deweys religious second wife a send-up of Reese Witherspoon as June Carter in ""Walk the Line."" Perhaps the strangest thing about ""Walk Hard"" is that in following the form of biopics and carting out all their tricks the movie ends up partaking of some of their power even while holding them up to ridicule. Its weird. Dewey doesnt exist and the character is a ludicrous amalgam of stereotypes but by the end you might actually start feeling something for him. It just shows that theres a reason for the biopic formula Its indestructible. -- Advisory This film contains full frontal male nudity simulated sex female nudity drug use and strong language.

"Walk Hard Parody That Verges on Pedestrian washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Walk Hard Parody That Verges on Pedestrian Network News X Profile View More Activity Play Video TRAILER | Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 21 2007 The hoary cinematic genre of the musical biopic is by now so structurally threadbare aesthetically bankrupt and riddled with risible cliches that one first response to the biopic parody ""Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story"" is What took you so long? The second response upon actually seeing it is Why isnt it better? Another sure-fire teenage hit from Judd Apatow (""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" ""Knocked Up"") ""Walk Hard"" is one of those fish-in-a-barrel comedies that mine a rich comedic vein but manage to come up with few genuine gems. John C. Reilly plays the title character a country boy who as a small child accidentally hacks his older brighter brother in half with a machete a trauma that will make him lose his sense of smell. ""Youve gone smell-blind"" his devoted mama shrieks while his outraged father keeps shouting that the wrong kid died. Resemblances to ""Ray"" and ""Walk the Line"" are purely intentional as Dewey strikes out to become a musician and against all odds makes it as an overnight sensation. All this while being a husband and a father at 15. Directed and co-written by Jake Kasdan ""Walk Hard"" proceeds to skewer the most cherished tropes of Hollywood biopics from stock scenes of Dewey succumbing to drugs and groupies to the inevitable backup singer who becomes his mistress (played by Jenna Fischer of ""The Office""). Meanwhile Dewey hits all the major musical movements of the past generation including 1950s rockabilly protest folk music acid-fueled concept rock a hip-hop mash-up and finally the masterpiece he writes as a tribute to his dead brother the redemption of all the squalor prison and rehab that have gone before. It all sounds so good on paper like the ""Talladega Nights"" of sex drugs and rock-and-roll. And there are some chuckles to be had throughout ""Walk Hard"" which depends for much of its humor on scenes of graphic vulgarity that are usually glossed over in mainstream Hollywood movies. The teenage kids to whom ""Walk Hard"" is directed will no doubt howl at an early moment when Dewey is talking to his long-suffering wife back home while surrounded by naked hung-over hangers-on a scene that culminates in a sight gag involving a full frontal shot of a nameless actors lower extremities. When the filmmakers arent working blue they make silly sport of the biopics penchant for on-the-nose exposition with supporting characters saying things like ""Guess this is the end to a chapter in your life Dewey Cox."" Shamelessly hitting the easy mark when it isnt pandering to the lowest common denominator ""Walk Hard"" traffics in the same raunch and heh-heh double-entendres (think of Deweys last name) that has made Apatow such a cash cow. But what could have been a satire on the level of ""This Is Spinal Tap"" or Christopher Guests mockumentaries -- heck even Austin Powers -- often plays like an extended sophomoric ""Saturday Night Live"" skit and not just because such ""SNL"" veterans as Kristen Wiig Tim Meadows and Chris Parnell show up in supporting roles. Stereotypes abound in ""Walk Hard"" from sex-crazed ""Negro"" dangers in the juke joint where Dewey hones his performance skills to the Hasidic Jews who run the record company that signs him; they eventually become as lame as a shockingly unfunny sequence in which Dewey meets the Beatles in India. (Shocking because Jack Black Paul Rudd Jason Schwartzman and Justin Long as the Fab Four should be well fab.) Still there are some hilarious moments in ""Walk Hard"" such as when Dewey in his Brian Wilson phase fills his studio not just with a full orchestra but with Aboriginal musicians a didgeridoo a glockenspiel and a goat. (In an uncanny moment of pop-cultural synchrony this marks the second time this year that a fiction film has paid homage to the Bob Dylan documentary ""Dont Look Back"" here with Dewey singing the uproarious nonsense song ""Royal Jelly."") Trivia fans will want to look out for cameos from Lyle Lovett Jackson Browne Ghostface Killah Eddie Vedder and Jack White who mumbles with flawless incomprehensibility as Elvis. The best part of ""Walk Hard"" oddly enough is the music which has been written by such lights as Marshall Crenshaw (""Walk Hard"") Van Dyke Parks (the ""Smile""-esque ""Black Sheep"") and the team of Dan Bern and Mike Viola who composed most of the music in the movie. (The entire soundtrack was produced by Michael Andrews.) Like ""Spinal Tap"" and Guests ""A Mighty Wind"" the soundtrack of ""Walk Hard"" holds up on its own not only because the songs are genuinely funny and good but because as he proved in ""Chicago"" Reilly has a glorious voice his by turns tender and soaring tenor often recalling Roy Orbison. Im not sure I care to see ""Walk Hard"" a second time but I cant wait to hear it again. Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story (98 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for sexual content graphic nudity drug use and profanity.

"Movie review Dewey Cox hits all the right notes - Mercury News Entertainment Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeMovie review Dewey Cox hits all the right notesJohn C. Reilly delivers a perfect combination of comedy and crooningBy Bruce NewmanMercury NewsPosted 12/19/2007 012530 PM PSTUpdated 12/20/2007 035604 PM PSTClick photo to enlargeTim Meadows John C. Reilly Matt Besser and Chris Parnell from the movie ""Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story."" (AP Photo/Sony Pictures Gemma La Mana)<<12>> It would be difficult to imagine a movie genre as ready-made for parody as the legend-of-music biopic and ""Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story"" milks the pat formulations of its brethren such as ""Walk the Line"" for all the laughs theyre worth. And then some. On screen in such pictures as ""The Buddy Holly Story"" ""Coal Miners Daughter"" and ""Ray"" all music legends come up the same way the hard way. Born to neglectful sharecropper moonshiner daddies and weepy mommas they strive for fame achieve fame achieve massive quantities of drugs go to rehab then get redemption. Along the way the men sometimes discard a wife or two before finally meeting a good gal who loves and understands them accepts them for the self-indulgent drug bingeing serial fornicators they are. The premise underlying ""Walk Hard"" is that if you cant have a little fun with goofballs like that youre just not trying hard enough. And the script for this mostly solid gold spoof - written by Judd Apatow and Jake Kasdan whose previous collaborations were the TV shows ""Freaks and Geeks"" and ""Undeclared"" - never stops trying to have fun. If it sometimes strains for a laugh where there isnt one the movie also finds them in places you wouldnt expect. The problem with parodies is that they rely almost entirely upon excess and in movies nothing exceeds like excess. Even the best ones such as ""Airplane"" and Mel Brooks Hitchcock spoof ""High Anxiety"" usually run out of gas once you get the main joke; from that point on everything else is just a variation on that.Advertisement But Apatow and Kasdan (who also directs) have imbued ""Walk Hard"" with so much rascal charm - and in John C. Reilly theyve found the perfect person for the title role - that even when the movie drags you find yourself rooting for it to make one more comeback. Just like Dewey Cox. They must have been tempted to cast a bigger name in the lead someone like Will Ferrell. But Reilly who played Ferrells sidekick in ""Talladega Nights The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" proved he can sing with his Oscar-nominated performance in ""Chicago"" and here he delivers a perfect combination of comedy and crooning. Reilly may go into this movie a relative unknown but he comes out a star. Mocking the somber flashbacks and overawed attention to rural beginnings that were hallmarks of the recent Johnny Cash and Ray Charles movies ""Walk Hard"" picks up Dewey Cox in a darkened backstage corridor as someone frantically urges his silhouette to get out there and perform. Finally his drummer Sam (Tim Meadows) emerges from the shadows and explains the delay. ""Dewey Cox needs to think about his entire life before he plays"" he says. Which he then does. As a boy Dewey suffers the tragic loss of his older brother Nate (Chip Hormess) followed by the equally heartbreaking loss of his sense of smell. After Nates unfortunate demise Deweys daddy (Raymond J. Barry) tells him bitterly ""Youre not half the boy that Nate was."" After youve seen the movie you might question the old mans math but not his larger point Dewey has always been in Nates shadow. And even after the shadow is half of what it used to be it still looms over Dewey as the movie picks him up again at 14 (played by Reilly now) about to perform in a high school talent show. No one seems to expect much from Dewey but when he sings he sounds like Roy Orbison. Spectators leap to their feet and start dancing as if they were spontaneously combusting. Encouraged by this first blush of success he marries his 12-year-old girlfriend (Kristen Wiig of ""Saturday Night Live"") who keeps having babies and keeps telling him hell never make it in show business. But when he sings ""Walk Hard"" Dewey becomes a star anddiscovers sex drugs rock and roll more or less in that order. He also falls for his new backup singer Darlene (Jenna Fischer of ""The Office""). The rest as they say is history. Dewey succumbs to excess of every kind including finally the running time of his own life story. But thats OK. Dewey Cox has to think about his entire life before its funny and a thing like that takes time. WALK HARD THE DEWEY COX STORY  Rated R (sexual content graphic nudity drug use profanity) Cast John C.

And drinks. And does drugs. And sleeps with any number of women (and fathers a boatload of children by them). But most of all he rocks. As does John C. Reilly who plays him in Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story. Its the role of a lifetime for Reilly who plays Cox from a teenager to an old man (older actors playing kids are a running joke). He traces the history of rock embodied in one person from Elvis through Dylan and the Beatles to Smile-era Brian Wilson to disco and punk and beyond. If it sounds ridiculous well . . . duh. The latest comedy from the Judd Apatow team - Apatow co-wrote the script with director Jake Kasdan - replaces the underlying sweetness of previous efforts such as Knocked Up and Superbad with a out-and-out silliness. But if its not as deep as those movies which is kind of an odd but fitting word to use to describe them its often every bit as funny. Reilly in particular is fall-down-laughing funny especially when Dewey is in all his drugged-out glory. For instance theres an orgy scene you wont soon forget no matter how hard you try. The audience may be shocked but not Dewey who at this point has seen and done so much with so many people he doesnt blink an eye. Without giving anything away its a signature Apatow scene. If somethings funny hell beat it to death and gleefully so. The repetition particularly with something outrageous becomes part of the joke. Dewey has the classic rock-star background coddled by his mother but hated by his father for his part in a childhood tragedy albeit a tragedy of the Monty Python variety. After discovering his talent as a musician and songwriter and finding success at a high school show he sets out on the road with his girlfriend where fate finds him fronting a band in a club on the night record-company executives are in the audience. In a fit of desperation in the studio he cuts his signature hit Walk Hard. From there its Rock History 101 combined with clown school as Dewey both succeeds and falls prey to every wretched excess you can imagine. How wretched? Well theres the orgy scene. How excessive? He gets himself a monkey. Along the way Dewey finds love after a fashion with Darlene (Jenna Fischer) not letting a silly little detail like his current marriage deter him. He travels to India to meditate with the now-bickering Beatles; in one of the films more inspired bits Jack Black plays Paul McCartney. Walk Hard has a certain style of comedy. Everything is announced sometimes telegraphed. McCartney isnt just Paul McCartney for instance. Hes Paul McCartney of the Beatles on almost every reference. If it sounds repetitious and stupid thats because sometimes it is. But its also hilarious. That kind of comedy takes skill of course but also confidence. If you tell the audience a joke is coming youd better make it funny. And Walk Hard does. Reilly Apatow and real songwriters including Marshall Crenshaw wrote several songs including Walk Hard (a double-entendre-laden duet with Darlene is particularly funny). Real music stars show up to play them as well. All part of the swirling mercurial life of Dewey Cox. Maybe youve heard He rocks.

Reilly playing the title balladeer from teen to senior citizen generating enough goodwill to offset the flat sections and a decidedly juvenile streak. At first this ""Walk the Line"" sendup sounds more like a sketch than a movie before director Jake Kasdan and co-writer/producer Judd Apatow broaden it to include every tic of the musical biopic from ""The Buddy Holly Story"" through the current wave. ""Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story"" thus strums the genre for considerable laughs with John C. Reilly playing the title balladeer from teen to senior citizen generating enough goodwill to offset the flat sections and a decidedly juvenile streak. While unlikely to rival Apatows recent hits box office should sing a merry little tune as a raunchy Oscar-bait alternative. Hewing more toward ""Airplane"" territory than he has previously Apatow incorporates members of his repertory company in what amounts to a variety of amusing cameos such as Paul Rudd popping up as one of the Beatles. For whatever reason this Sony release also features a vast assortment of NBCs comedy talent starting with ""The Offices"" Jenna Fischer and ""Saturday Night Lives"" Kristen Wiig as the protagonists overlapping wives. Infused with a adolescent streak that revels in its R rating and never seems to tire of puns derived from Deweys last name pic dutifully chronicles the life of Reillys Cox from well-telegraphed boyhood tragedy to unexpected stardom to drug abuse despite half-hearted ""You dont want to try this"" warnings from band member Sam (Tim Meadows). Along the way Apatow and Kasdan (coming off the satirical ""The TV Set"") zero in on a surprising number of spoof-worthy conventions within these films The star playing his character starting at a ridiculously young age (when Reilly takes over as Dewey hes 14); black characters bursting into raucous dance when a budding white singer lets loose; nurturing Jewish (here Hassidic) record executives; and the excess that invariably accompanies stardom -- in Deweys case not just drugs but destructive rages that consistently wreak havoc on bathroom fixtures. Having worked out his comedy chops for Apatow in ""Talladega Nights The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" Reilly not only belts out the double-entendre-laden tunes -- one of which sounds impressively like Roy Orbison -- but unabashedly dives into the silliness of the role. Fischer also makes the most of her turn as the backup singer who wins Deweys heart but much to his chagrin keeps withholding her body. ""Walk Hard"" employs a quartet of songwriters -- among them Marshall Crenshaw -- to cleverly craft Deweys songography which should yield a dynamite tie-in novelty soundtrack. One suspects many a young lad will find himself humming ""In my dreams youre blowin me (pause) sweet kisses"" perhaps even inadvertently. By its very nature the movie is episodic in its chronological stroll through Deweys fictional life and not all the bits (among them a ""Yellow Submarine""-like acid trip) work equally well. Fortunately theres a general exuberance and fondness for the musical material that eases the rough spots down to meticulous technical touches ranging from the evolving costumes and hairdos to the conspicuous makeup as Dewey enters his ""Driving Miss Daisy"" years. For Apatow ""Walk Hard"" also continues to demonstrate that gleefully embracing R-rated comedy neednt be reserved for DVD extras; rather its possible to walk hard laugh hard and still earn hard -- a formula thats surely music to any studios ears.

Reilly Tim Meadows Jack White; Director Jake Kasdan; Author Judd Apatow Jake Kasdan; Release Date Wide 12/21/2007; Runtime (in minutes) 98; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Columbia Pictures Posted January 4 2008 -- 1200 AM EST Walk Hard a parody of warts-and-all pop-star biopics comes out of the Judd Apatow factory (he produced and co-wrote it) and at first it appears to be nothing more or less than this years model of Epic Movie Not Another Teen Movie and all those other happy-idiot genre spoofs that descend from the Airplane school of artfully hyperbolic razzing. Directed by Jake Kasdan the movie tells the story of Dewey Cox (John C. Reilly) a doltish country-rocker who becomes a star meets a stage partner (sparkly Jenna Fischer) as prudish as a nun and enjoys a rise to legend status matched only by his druggy Daddy didnt love me fall. A handful of the jokes score (the boy Dewey slicing his brother in half which inspires his dads refrain of ""The wrong kid died"") a few fall flat (a not-dirty-enough tweak of dirty dancing) and most are mildly clever enough to keep you grinning. The movie walks the line of surreal vulgarity (you will not repeat not expect the penis) yet most of it intentionally is less nutzoid than your average megaplex genre parody. Its a teensy bit straighter and thats a good thing since it allows Kasdan to take on not just the cliches of the biopic but the emotions as well. He skewers the spirit of rock history. As Dewey moves into the hippie 60s then the variety-show 70s Reilly lends his weariness a goofy heart. Walk Hard isnt merciless (except for maybe one wicked sequence with the Beatles) and thats because it so loves what its sending up the pleasure ego and sheer exhaustion of what happens behind the music.
