Reinvigorating a genre well past its sell-by date with a combo of dry wit widescreen panache and a cast that handles the expletive-strewn dialogue like rough poetry pic looks set to hook younger auds. As one of the Cockney crims in Nick Loves Spanish-set gangster yarn might put it ""The Business"" is the bollocks. Reinvigorating a genre well past its sell-by date with a combo of dry wit widescreen panache and a cast that handles the expletive-strewn dialogue like rough poetry pic looks set to hook younger auds at U.K. wickets on Sept. 2 release with warm business elsewhere in Europe. Stateside where the slangy dialogue and cultural specificity will limit broad acceptance it will be more of a specialty item though the films sheer style and verve could build a cult following. On the surface Loves third feature is a rollercoaster ride through -- and a sardonic valentine to -- the Thatcherite 80s an era of conspicuous consumption in British society paralleled here by a bunch of expat villains on Spains southern coast. (The so-called ""Costa del Crime"" flourished as a criminal haven for Brits due to a temporary absence of any extradition law between the two countries.) At a deeper level and following on from his previous feature soccer-hooliganism drama ""The Football Factory"" film is another look by the young writer-director at English tribal rituals -- here in a working-class criminal setting. Just as the young wannabe in ""Factory"" longed for the fast-lane of group bravaderie and a good post-game punch-up so Frankie (Danny Dyer) hooks up with the elite of the Costa del Sols English drug barons and their amoral lifestyle. Like the voiceover narrator of ""Factory"" Frankie stakes out his ground in the opening scenes. ""Better to be someone for a day than no one for a lifetime"" he says before clubbing his abusive father to death in a dour southeast London housing project and then skedaddling to Malaga as bagman for a drug deal. Taken on as a driver by charismatic bar owner Charlie (Tamer Hassan in pics standout performance) Frankie soon idolizes his perma-tanned boss and flashy world. However when hes introed to Charlies business partner the seriously psychotic Sammy (Geoff Bell) and Sammys hot-to-trot but off-limits g.f. Carly (Georgina Chapman) he starts to think he may be out of his depth. This is the same territory and era as the first half of ""Sexy Beast"" and Love also milks the sun-blasted setting and extravagant characters and clothes for all theyre worth. Damian Bromleys strikingly composed widescreen lensing profits from its DV origins with almost electric colors and costume design by Andrew Cox is right on the money from leisure wear to shades. However where ""Sexy Beast"" gradually listed under the weight of its grandstanding stars ""The Business"" stays light on its feet with a much lesser-known ensemble cast. Under Charlies tutelage Frankie helps smuggle marijuana across the straits from Morocco and even risks an occasional hot-tub session with Carly. But when Sammy starts to get jealous Charlie splits with his longtime partner and despite warnings from the local mayor (Arturo Venegas) to stick with soft drugs ventures with Frankie into the way more lucrative cocaine biz. The stage is set for multiple betrayals and falls from grace. Pics biggest surprise is that it maintains its momentum with hardly a blip across 96 minutes. The almost wall-to-wall music with a heavy component of 80s rock/disco classics certainly helps; but its the characters first and foremost who drive and sustain the movie effortlessly cruising on Loves dialogue as if to the manner born. Hassan one of the best things in ""Football Factory"" is aces here as the brash but ruthless Charlie -- think Antonio Banderas with a Cockney accent -- and Bell also very good as the disturbed Sammy. Pairs curious friendship is summed up in one of the pics scariest and most surreal scenes (testing bulletproof jackets in a stone quarry) that also epitomizes the hair-trigger blend of drama and comedy. Dyer who first came to attention as Moff in ""Human Traffic"" (1999) makes Frankie a much more shaded character than his confident voiceover suggests and carries the viewer along in a subtly slow-burning performance. As the manipulative goodtime girl Chapman looks and acts on the money.

"Barbershop 2 Back in Business | Variety Variety Continue to Variety () Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Review Barbershop 2 Back in Business Todd McCarthy 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr February 3 2004 | 1100PM PT Focused as much on Cedric the Entertainers highly popular (and momentarily controversial) uncensored opinion machine Eddie as on Ice Cubes shop proprietor sequel comes by weightier tone spotlighting threat posed to small family businesses by chain franchises. Domestic B.O. will approach but likely not surpass the 2002 original. A less raucous and more serious-minded neighborhood comedy than its entertaining predecessor ""Barbershop 2 Back in Business"" still provides enough solid character-based amusement to put customers in the chairs and send them out content with services rendered. Focused as much on Cedric the Entertainers highly popular (and momentarily controversial) uncensored opinion machine Eddie as on Ice Cubes shop proprietor sequel comes by its weightier tone due to the central theme spotlighting the threat posed to small family businesses by mushrooming chain franchises. Domestic B.O. will approach but likely not surpass the 75.8 million generated by the 2002 original although all theatrical biz will have to be done Stateside; first entry earned all of 1.3 million overseas as international distrib Fox couldnt stir up any interest in the almost entirely verbal ethnic funfest outside of some small change in Asia. But substantial home entertainment revenues will make this limitation a moot point. Aside from its comic content first film struck a chord with the public including a sizeable crossover crowd due to its portrayal of the barbershop as a cornerstone of an old-style storefront neighborhood and significantly a last bastion of free speech where everyone is free to say whatever is on their minds. This last part didnt go down too well with Jesse Jackson whose feathers were so ruffled he demanded some of Cedric the Entertainers lines about him and Martin Luther King Jr. be changed for homevid release. Although the filmmakers rightly declined to make any alterations they have largely steered clear of political targets this time around. Cedrics Eddie sounds off about the D.C. sniper (""the Jackie Robinson of crime"" because he ""broke into the white league"" of serial killing) biracial celebs like Tiger Woods Jennifer Beals and Vin Diesel and alleged child molesters R. Kelly and Michael Jackson. But the sociopolitical subjects broached by screenwriter Don D. Scott who was one of three scripters on the original are generally not the butt of jokes; while treated broadly they relate mostly to the ways of big city politics and the squeeze put on mom-and-pop operations when corporate America hits the hood. A few things have changed at the shop since it was last seen. After all his previous ambivalence about the enterprise he inherited from his father Calvin (Cube) has become proud of his establishment a place where the good times roll even when much of the talk is superficially acrimonious; the formerly inept white homey Isaac (Troy Garity) is now a wizard with the electric blade; the highfalutin Jimmy (Sean Patrick Thomas) has left to take a job with local alderman Brown (Robert Wisdom) and ex-con Ricky (Michael Ealy) and spirited femme haircutter Terri (Eve) may have something percolating. Then theres Queen Latifahs Gina a former girlfriend of Calvins who works at a salon right next door to the barbershop. Latifah gets good supporting character screen time here but stint is really just a warm-up for her spin-off starring vehicle ""Beauty Shop"" which starts shooting with the same producers next month. The good-natured folk at the shop go into a spin when they notice whats under construction across the street Nappy-Cutz a trendy national chain featuring vibrating chairs videoscreens aquariums and even a basketball court. Calvins optimistic take that ""Change is a good thing"" is put to rest by the outlets slick business rep Quentin (Harry Lennix) who assures him the old shop will be out of business within six months. Calvin is further unsettled when some other small business owners who are tempted to accept the already generous offers to sell being tendered by big real estate interests tell him they could probably double their money if he went along too. When Calvin decides to hold firm he undertakes a few community-friendly initiatives to cement customer loyalty such as redecorating and telling his employees to keep their voices down; latter move creates a library-like feel casting a pall over the joint that makes the reality of the threat sink in. Calvin also throws a neighborhood barbecue an event that merely provides an excuse for Eddie and Gina to get into an argument triggering a toe-to-toe throwdown between Cedric and the Queen. And while its mouth-watering to anticipate comic fireworks between these two frame-bursting talents the results arent quite the gut-busters one hopes for; amusing enough but hardly galvanizing. Same could be said for the entire film. As the drama accelerates around whether Calvin will capitulate to the profitable forces of gentrification or do the right thing by his heritage and community the lack of accumulated laughs appears more noticeable. At the same time the characters have generated a sense of family akin to those on beloved sitcoms so watching them represents a pleasure regardless. Unsurprisingly climax involves a Capra-esque public repudiation of greed and big money interests by the ordinary citizen hero. Taking over the directing reins from Tim Story helmer Kevin Rodney Sullivan (""How Stella Got Her Groove Back"") takes a fair amount of the action out of the barbershop onto the streets into characters residences and even into the past; latter is an important way in which Eddies character has been expanded as flashbacks reveal how he came to the shop in the first place back in the 60s and other youthful misadventures some of them on an El train. Returning thesps all fit into their roles as if they were comfortable old chairs. Newcomers Lennix Wisdom and Kenan Thompson the latter as brash Calvins young cousin who makes a mess of his short stint at the shop work in broad strokes. Except for returning lenser Tom Priestley main tech team is new but film is of a piece with the original thanks as much as anything to the lived-in feel of the Chicago settings.

"Barbershop 2 is a cut below the original - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Barbershop 2 is a cut below the original By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  February 6 2004 The best thing about ""Barbershop 2 Back in Business"" is also the best thing about ""Barbershop"" the social commentary. Theres a lot near the start when the same cavalcade of barbers in the same South Side Chicago shop argue about multiracial stars. ""What about Vin Diesel?"" somebody asks. ""Oh hes half car"" says Eddie (Cedric the Entertainer) whose hair still looks as if it leapt off Frederick Douglasss head and joined George Clintons touring crew.Eddie is still supplying the movies irreverent punch lines and theres a new one at least every 20 seconds until of course there isnt. The movies jokeless interludes stretch a crowd-pleasing comedy into tedium.Most of the meandering also features Cedric the Entertainer who was a shot in the arm to the 2002 original and is more like a thorn in its sequels side especially in the countless flashbacks to his characters late-1960s salad years. We find out how tubby young Eddie landed his job at Calvins barbershop. We learn about his love affair with a beautiful woman (Garcelle Beauvais) and that he used to sing a cappella on the el. One thing however has very little to do with the other; these tangents are just meant to lavish us with more Cedric whos much more entertaining in his beer ads than in these flashbacks.But because they touch on grave cultural touchstones like the rioting after Martin Luther King Jr.s assassination and double-knit polyester pants the trips back in time are meant to ground the movie in a specific sense of history. They just tack more time onto a movie that at 115 minutes is too long to begin with.But ""Barbershop 2"" has a lot to do. For one thing its barbers still have issues with one another. Terry (Eve) is trying to tame her anger while berating Ricky (Michael Ealy) for being a player. Ricky has an education secret that pushes the movie into the public service announcement territory. Hes also jealous of the outrageous popularity of Ike (Troy Garity) the shops white barber who actually calls himself ""Slim Fadey.""Amid all the squabbling and trips to yesteryear Calvin (Ice Cube) has to save his fathers shop -- again. This time from a land developer (Harry Lennix) who with the help of a flashy alderman is erecting a barbershop franchise called Nappy Cutz across the street. Its billed as the black Supercuts but when Calvin and his fellow barbers break in the place actually looks like a discarded set from Ice Cubes stripper melodrama ""The Players Club.""The movie also has to make room for Queen Latifah whos here to plug her upcoming ""Barbershop"" spinoff the economically named ""Beauty Shop."" So when this movies not cutting away to flat asides in her salon Latifahs Gina is barging into scenes to spar with Eddie and flirt with Calvin. Finally seeing Latifah and Cube together on screen is the rap equivalent of having to wait all those years to catch Streep and Pacino together in ""Angels in America."" ""Barbershop 2"" is decidedly the lesser event.The originals strong suit was hardly the intricacy of its plotting or the sophistication of its directing. But it was a rare good movie made with insight and love by black people for black people -- although hardly exclusively for them.This sequel is overstaffed with a cast thats underserved by Don D. Scotts schematic script and Kevin Rodney Sullivans crude direction. ""Barbershop 2"" still takes a dedicated and true snapshot of African-American life. But so little of its presentation is memorable. This is a haircut movie that redefines ""fade.""(""Barbershop 2 Back in Business"" ) Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Isaac Rosenberg (Troy Garity) the shops lone white stylist has gone from pariah to the shops best and most in-demand tonsorial artist signing his work with a small ""i"" etched into the hair on the nape of the neck. And what of Eddie (Cedric the Entertainer)? Well the shops senior barber is a lot grayer now for one thing looking even more like the love child of Frederick Douglass and the Bride of Frankenstein. As for his famously indecorous mouth which in the last film dissed Rodney King Rosa Parks Jesse Jackson Martin Luther King Jr. and other sacred cows its still in fine fettle. Here he sinks his teeth into the scandal-plagued Michael Jackson R. Kelly and Kobe Bryant even -- over the vociferous protests of his shop mates who plead for mercy due to the mans poor health -- singer Luther Vandross. Okay so some of the gang hasnt grown up -- thank God. In many ways ""Barbershop 2"" is the exact same movie as ""Barbershop"" give or take some minor tweaking that hasnt hurt its robust heart or wickedly subversive funny bone. Calvins shop is still in financial trouble only this time its not from a crooked businessman who wants to turn the place into a strip joint but from the arrival of a slick and impersonal chain barbershop just across the street whose owner threatens to put Calvin out of business unless Calvin persuades the other mom-and-pop stores on his block to take a buyout from the greedy developer his new rival is in cahoots with. The rest of the formula repeats itself with splendid if not unexpected results. Heartstrings will be tugged and ribs tickled particularly thanks to Cedric the Entertainer who reprises his brilliant scene-stealing and button-pushing political incorrectness shining with special brightness in a showdown with Queen Latifah as Calvins new beauty-salon neighbor. In a set piece the two face each other down at a barbecue trading escalating insults so uproarious that much of the dialogue was drowned out by audience laughter. One new touch in the sequel is the addition of flashback footage showing Eddies arrival at the shop and revealing his instrumental role in saving it from destruction during the 1968 riots in response to Kings assassination. Thats what makes both entries in the ""Barbershop"" franchise such rare treats. Sure theres a lot of what Eddie calls ""real conversation"" in these movies much of it empty -- if very funny -- blather. In fact it is precisely Calvins gift for gab that the developers want to exploit in their effort to make him talk his neighbors into selling. What separates Calvin and Eddie from the typical comic hero -- and each ""Barbershop"" movie from the standard yuk-fest -- is that these folks know how to back up all the hot air with meaningful action. BARBERSHOP 2 BACK IN BUSINESS (PG-13 98 minutes) -- Contains obscenity some roughhousing and a lot of humorous trash-talk. Area theaters.

"Barbershop 2 Sit Down And Take a Load Off washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living >> Follow Style On Barbershop 2 Sit Down And Take a Load Off Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday February 6 2004 ""Barbershop 2 Back in Business"" isnt going to give ""The Godfather Part II"" a run for its money as the best sequel ever made. Nor does it have the same comic oomph as 2002s ""Barbershop."" But its a warm often funny reunion of the sassiest chattiest characters ever to buzz a brothers head. Youll like this one more than youd expect. Proprietor Calvin (Ice Cube) is back again trying to make ends meet in his shop on Chicagos South Side. The joint established in 1958 -- and miraculously the only business left standing after the riots of the 60s -- is the central meeting place for just about any talking point on the minds of black Americans. This is the place to throw down about anything politics men women and the perfect butt size on a woman. Oh and you can get your hair cut too. It has always been a struggle to keep the place afloat in this less-than-affluent neighborhood. But it looks like the end for sure when big business starts gentrifying the block. Most ominous a nationwide chain called Nappy Cutz is about to open a glitzy franchise right across the street. This plush upscale hair cuttery offers luxury while you wait with indoor basketball hoops and vibrating chairs. Theres even a tank of tropical fish. Its haircut heaven or seems to be. Calvin and associates including big-haired Eddie (Cedric the Entertainer) sultry Terri (Eve) and slick soul-brother wannabe Isaac (Troy Garity) suddenly look like small potatoes indeed. The less we talk about the movies Capraesque plot pitting small-business community values against soulless consumerism the more trees we save. What counts are the characters. Mr. Cube has always exuded an appealing baby-faced petulance; he does the same here. And the familiar dilemmas of the first movie flare up again Terri still has a thing for studly Ricky (Michael Ealy) while she maintains her cold war with yuppified Jimmy James (Sean Patrick Thomas). And lovelorn West African shop assistant Dinka (an amusing Leonard Earl Howze) meets that special ready-for-African-love somebody. But the movies big star is clearly Eddie whose iconoclastic rant about civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks in 2002s ""Barbershop"" caused such a fuss in the African American community. He goes at it again striking an even more sensitive nerve The D.C. sniper he declares (treating John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo as one entity) should be considered the ""Jackie Robinson of crime"" since serial killers historically have been white. Hey Eddies only just started. He doesnt care whos hollering at him. Through extended flashbacks we learn Eddie has a greater significance in the history of Calvins shop than anyone realized. This arty addition to the story doesnt quite sit right. Do we really need such depth in this kind of flick? Better to return to the funnier Eddie of the present. Even more distracting is a tacky promo for Queen Latifahs spinoff movie ""Beauty Shop."" A preview of this upcoming female version of the ""Barbershop"" series runs just before the movie and in ""Barbershop 2"" she gets a scene or two duking verbally with Eddie. But for the most part ""Barbershop 2"" stays to its own roots. To quote Calvin the shop -- and the spirit of this movie -- is about ""real people real conversation real barbers."" Barbershop 2 Back in Business (106 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for obscenity sexual situations and drug references.

The second Barbershop is just as sharply funny and as heartwarming yet unsentimental as the first. (Related video Watch the Barbershop 2 trailer) Queen Latifah stars as Gina in Barbershop 2 Back in Business. By Tracey Bennett MGM Calvins landmark establishment is still a place where the barbers and their regulars can say just about anything in the realm of politics entertainment race relations or social issues and audiences can share a laugh or 10. This is what movie marketers can legitimately call a viable franchise. For moviegoers that translates into distinctive characters and a talented ensemble cast that we gladly will watch through succeeding installments -- not unlike the way we enjoyed the folks at the Cheers bar or the cabbies on Taxi. The old-school barbershop run by Calvin Jr. (Ice Cube) is weathering the neighborhoods encroaching gentrification. Lattes abound and some of the old-timers are considering selling their stores to entrepreneurs who will turn them into gyms or juice bars. More on Barbershop Barbershop 2 Back in Business (   out of four) Stars Ice Cube Cedric the Entertainer Queen Latifah Sean Patrick Thomas Director Kevin Rodney Sullivan Distributor MGM Pictures Rating PG-13 for language sexual material and brief drug references. Opens Friday nationwide The worst affront is ""Nappy Cutz"" a high-tech salon that is opening across the street from Calvins decidedly low-tech establishment. Adding to the ribald humor this time around is a peek inside the beauty shop next door run by Gina (Queen Latifah). The haircuts are cool but its the collection of opinionated barbers that keeps the regulars coming. Calvin is smart ethical and cool-headed. Eddie (Cedric the Entertainer) threatens to steal the movie with his larger-than-life tell-it-like-it-is humor and surprisingly big heart. Verbal salvos are aimed at everyone from Kobe Bryant to Condoleezza Rice. When talk turns to blacks proudly ""claiming"" those of color Terri (Eve) the shops lone female barber points out ""One guy I dont want to take credit for is that D.C. sniper."" But Eddie takes a unique view ""That guy was like the Jackie Robinson of crime. He broke into the white leagues"" of criminals. No one is immune A Muslim dismisses Terris devotion to Jesus saying ""You dont have a problem with a savior that looks like Kenny G?"" When so much entertainment dumbs down or attempts to create a false consensus Barbershop 2 shows us a multiplicity of views and reminds us that no ethnic group holds a monolithic body of opinions. And it does this in a rowdy hilarious fashion which is often an effective way to get people to think about important social questions.

Two years ago controversy swelled around ""Barbershop"" because of jokes Eddie the barber (Cedric the Entertainer) made about civil-rights icons Rosa Parks the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Rev. Jesse Jackson. A boycott was urged by among others Jackson. Instead -- surprise -- everyone flocked to the film and it made a mint. Now its ""Barbershop 2 Back in Business"" and while the barbershop is still run by Calvin (Ice Cube) its Eddies business we want to hear. He doesnt disappoint. Some of his targets are easy (his advice to Bill Clinton ""Lock the door""). But while everyone else shakes their head over the D.C. sniper you can almost feel Eddie mentally sharpening his razor against his strap. Movie review Showtimes and trailer 1/2 ""Barbershop 2 Back in Business"" with Ice Cube Cedric the Entertainer Sean Patrick Thomas Eve Queen Latifah. Directed by Kevin Rodney Sullivan. Written by Don D. Scott. 98 minutes. Rated PG-13 for language sexual material and brief drug references. Several theaters. When he calls the sniper ""the Jackie Robinson of crime"" because with his sharpshooting ability and the insanity to use it ""he broke into the white leagues"" its raw funny and provokes howls of protest. From within the barbershop. Mr. Jackson I assume will know enough to keep quiet. ""Barbershop 2"" is in some ways better than the original where if you remember a few characters were dull stereotypes (the white guy who sounded black; the black guy who sounded white). These characters are back just not so broadly drawn. Isaac (Troy Garity Jane Fondas son) is now the star stylist at Calvins (the others call him ""8 Mile"") while Jimmy (Sean Patrick Thomas) works for the local alderman. Ah but there has to be a plot doesnt there? This time the shop is threatened when a high-end hair-salon chain -- ""Nappy Cutz"" -- opens across the street. The entire block is in the process of being gentrified and old folks are losing their homes. Will Calvin sell out -- literally or metaphorically -- or will he stand up for whats right? If you cant answer that one dont worry there are several transparent subplots to chose from as well. Some developments are just downright silly. When the alderman trailing a camera crew comes into the shop Eddie sits him down in front of the newbie (""SNLs"" Kenan Thompson) Calvins wifes cousin who hasnt cut anyones hair let alone their most important client in years. Predictability ensues. Theres also several sepia-toned flashbacks to the late 60s as we discover a) how Eddie started working at the barbershop b) how he saved the shop from rioters c) how he hooked up with an impossibly good-looking girl (Garcelle Beauvais) but not d) why they split up. Its still funny and warm and neighborly inside Calvins barbershop; its just a little predictable as soon as you step outside.

Starring Ice Cube Cedric the Entertainer. Directed by Kevin Rodney Sullivan. Written by Don D. Scott. (PG- 13. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters). Cedric the Entertainer stole ""Barbershop."" Hes handed ""Barbershop 2."" Given an arc that shows that his character wasnt always an incorrigible coot Cedric dominates the film producing consistent laughs and rendering the pictures community and anti-corporate messages less medicinal. Cedrics barber Eddie continues his compulsive commentary about African American society of course but targets such as R. Kelly are hardly the unimpeachable figures (Rosa Parks Martin Luther King Jr.) roasted in the first ""Barbershop."" A warmhearted and surprisingly ambitious sequel to the 2002 hit ""Barbershop 2"" revisits the formula from the first movie by having shop owner Calvin (Ice Cube) threatened again with closure this time by a soulless chain salon called Nappy Cutz. A sequel reviving what made the original work is to be expected. That ""Barbershop 2"" also deepens the originals social concerns was not expected. The sequel (written by Don D. Scott co-author of the original) overplays notions of civic pride but its still far more thoughtful than most studio comedies. ""Barbershop 2"" frequently dips into the past cementing the shops status as an institution in its South Side Chicago neighborhood. It starts with a funny black-and-white sequence explaining Eddies loyalty to the shop. On the run from police Eddie finds refuge in Calvins fathers barber chair -- and gets more than he bargained for. The back story allows Cedric to do a little dramatic work most notably in a scene where a scared but determined Eddie battles looters during the 1968 riots. The characters younger self devoid of the heavy aging makeup Cedric usually wears even gets to be a ladies man leading to an uproarious improbable action sequence where Eddie makes a mad dash for a woman he glimpsed on the train. The flashback scenes are also notable because Cedric drops the mush-mouth delivery of his older guise. Some of what he says as the older Eddie is too hard to make out which is a shame because it was probably funny. ""Barbershop 2"" like its predecessor always works best when the barbers and customers get to riff. Director Kevin Rodney Sullivan (""How Stella Got Her Groove Back"") uses a handheld camera to increase spontaneity swerving from the chatter of Eddie to the braggadocio of the shops lone white barber (Troy Garity) now so confident that he showboats with styling tools as if hes Tom Cruise in ""Cocktail."" The barbers played by rapper Eve and Michael Ealy (as the ex-con) shoot each other alternately hostile and lustful looks. Eddies most incendiary riff concerns the Washington D.C. sniper and other subjects are similarly topical as if the filmmakers shot up to the last possible second. Jokes about Parks and King as unpopular as they were with the Rev. Jesse Jackson are at least timeless. The immediacy of the humor in ""Barbershop 2"" makes you wonder about the movies shelf life. Ice Cube anchors this film as he did the last but he also has to take one for the team. Calvins role as a voice of reason and shop savior requires Cube to be almost stodgy. Still its a kick to see the reserved Cube awkwardly embracing every customer as part of Calvins bid for better customer service. Queen Latifah appears as a stylist in Calvins beauty shop next door engaging in a spirited but stagy battle-of-the-sexes comic showdown with Cedrics Eddie. Latifahs extended cameo is basically a setup for her own ""Barbershop"" spin-off (the forthcoming ""Beauty Shop"") and it shows. The corporate invasion brings nefarious characters the most enjoyably oily being Robert Wisdoms dodgy alderman. But the gentrification/corruption angle weighs down the story and produces too much exposition about the barbershops place in the neighborhood. That concept works much better when seen -- in flashbacks and in comic interplay within the shops walls -- than when heard. Advisory This film contains raw language suggestive humor.
