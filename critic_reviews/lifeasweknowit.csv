But turning the boy-hating girl and the girl-hating boy into instant parents -- that takes some ingenuity. To bring together the uptight gal Holly Berenson (Katherine Heigl) and the stud-muffin guy Eric Messer (Josh Duhamel) the writers of Life as We Know It had an inspiration make these two unsuitable people the respective best friends of a happily married couple with an adorable infant ... then kill off the parents in a car crash and reveal that they had secretly designated Holly and Messer as the babys joint guardians who must now live together in the dead couples house to raise the baby. If you had bugged the office where this brainstorm took place you probably would have heard cheers. Plot problem solved And never mind the odor of mangled flesh and steel that suffuses the rest of the picture. Life as We Know It -- written by Ian Deitchman and Kristin Rusk Robinson and directed by Greg Berlanti -- is another dreadful entry in the festering form of romantic comedy the forced intimacy of two people who have nothing in common but hatred for each other. We saw it just over the past year or so in The Proposal Did You Hear About the Morgans? and Leap Year. Though the latter two were forgettable flops Hollywood must think theres magic in this collision of the severely flawed. Recall that the philosopher Hegel defined ""genuine tragedies"" as ""conflicts between two rights."" Heigl who also produced her new movie must think romantic comedy emerges from the conflict of two wrongs -- of half-people who become whole by growing out of their extreme views and meeting in the middle with a fade-out kiss. Holly and Messer arent exactly parent material; hes only chronologically a grownup. But by living together theyll mature into fond lovers and good parents. (See TIMEs 2010 fall entertainment preview.) Actually thats not the worst premise for a rom-com. And somewhere in the universe of theoretical movies there could be an appealing mating of Heigl and Duhamel he the tall unthreatening hunk from TV (Las Vegas) and movies (the Transformers franchise) she the Greys Anatomy star who was the bedrock of sexual common sense in Knocked Up -- and when she was just 15 Gerard Depardieus precocious naively enticing daughter in the 1994 My Father the Hero. We keep seeing Heigls potential as a fine comic actress and the curse of optimism continue to be disappointed when she betrays her best instincts. (See Heigl in TIMEs top 10 worst chick flicks.) For theres an odd similarity to Life as We Know It and 27 Dresses and The Ugly Truth the movies Heigl has chosen to solidify her star status after Knocked Up her character usually comes across as a prude a pill and a dominatrix (but not in the fun way). Hollys last boyfriend of three years walked out on her -- perhaps because as she describes herself ""Im a little bit of a control freak."" She always plays a creative career woman -- here the owner-chef of a boutique bakery called Fraiche (a word no one in the film can pronounce correctly) -- whose life is empty because shes not married. In Life as We Know It Hollys friends her assistant at the bakery and total strangers reprove her for being single. (Messer the technical director of Atlanta Hawks games on TV gets different advice. One harried husband searching for an analogy for marriage says ""Imagine a prison -- and then dont change anything."") In this movie the comedy to use the generic term rises from indignities inflicted on Holly being stoned on marijuana when she meets the babys social worker sporting a dab of baby poop on her face as she greets the neighbors. In the big breakup scene at a block party Heigl and Duhamel are both obliged to do their emoting with their faces painted like clown felines. And when she finally finds Dr. Right (Josh Lucas as a kindly pediatrician) fate keeps crossing their stars first when her call to him is interrupted by the news that her friends have died; then on a fabulous first date when Messer calls to say the babys suffering from a urinary-tract infection; then after Holly and her pediatrician have settled in when Messer returns from Phoenix to set in motion his final reconciliation with her. (See TIMEs top 10 angry breakup songs.) What could have saved this movie? Deitchman and Rusk Robinson having come up with a gruesome way to make a twosome might have nervily pursued their dark muse into black comedy. As it is theres just one creepy moment Holly and Messer have their first real sex in the bedroom of the deceased couple. At this point viewers may be roused from their torpor to whisper a queasily admiring ""Ewwww."" For the rest of Life as We Know It youre likely to think youre at home watching some substandard TV show and find yourself pressing the fast-forward button on an invisible remote. But attendance in a movie theater requires more decisive activity get up and walk out. See the 100 best movies of all time. See the top 10 Hollywood remakes.

The predicates missing. As anyone whos ever had a kid already knows the full sentence is ""Life as we know it is over"" i.e. nuked by the sudden and irreversible arrival of a human infant. And that pretty much sums up the film. Its marketing campaign suggests a certain amount of comedy and its triangulated stars imply a certain amount of romance but both the comedy and the romance hinge on poop puke sleep deprivation more poop and bouts of fussy eating accompanied by piercing screams. As one whos given birth a few times I can appreciate that smear on Katherine Heigls face; truly no film about rearing a 1-year-old would be complete without a spot or two of misplaced fecal matter. But you should know what youre in for at the start. Directed by Greg Berlanti from a screenplay by Ian Deitchman and Kristin Rusk Robinson Life As We Know It stars Heigl and Josh Duhamel as battling Atlanta godparents tapped to raise adorable moppet Sophie (played by Clagett triplets Brooke Brynn and Alexis) after her parents (Hayes MacArthur and Mad Mens Christina Hendricks) die in a car crash. By this mechanism theyre tossed into the maelstrom of pureed food and large plastic objects that swirls through early childhood. The added twist naturally is that Heigls character and Duhamels loathe each other. Heigls Holly is a buttoned-down businesswoman who owns and runs a hipster bakery -- the occupation du jour among rom-com heroines these days -- while Duhamels Messer is an unrepentant Lothario who dotes on Sophie but dislikes the way she cramps his lovin style. The standardized format for such plots requires a third wheel in this case Josh Lucas as a spiffy sweet and unnaturally passive pediatrician who might have been portrayed by Ralph Bellamy back in the day. Heigl is an old hand at super-neurotic lonely hearts but she seems to lack conviction this time. Duhamel an easy fit in playboy roles has lately sported the fuzzy domestic aura of an actor looking to soften his M.O. But the toned-down shtick on both their parts is more a function of the movies baby-centric plotline than any problems with chemistry between them. They sputter nicely together whipping up a believable fizzy charm that almost distracts us from the canned predictability of the script. Still. The poop. Berlantis movie takes on two of the sloppiest and least-forgiving topics in all of film - grief then babies - and it does so whole-heartedly with a mild touch and an almost reportorial attention to detail. That said the ins and outs of a childs alimentary canal dont make for breathtaking cinematic excitement even with breaks for grocery store runs. Watching Duhamel and Heigl discover the joys and pains of parenthood is cute as far as it goes but their story cant progress too far until the kid is out of diapers.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post ""Life as We Know It"" is romantic comedy pretty much as weve come to expect it. Yes there are some twists a nice comedic turn or two but the inevitable hook-up of dueling opposites is never anything but inevitable. Katherine Heigl plays Atlanta bakery owner Holly Berenson. Josh Duhamel portrays Eric Messer a television producer for the Atlanta Hawks basketball team. Josh Lucas arrives as Sam a handsome pediatrician and required wrinkle. When Holly and Erics dearest friends set them up on a date its a disaster. He arrives scruffy. Shes ever so put together. He rides a battered motorcycle. Shes got a spiffy gas-sipper hardly bigger than his bike. A couple of years later the two arent any more fond of each other. But they are godparents to best friends Peter and Alisons baby girl. Director Greg Berlanti and writers Ian Deitchman and Kristin Rusk Robinson over-accentuate Hollys and Erics clash of sensibilities. Audiences are so well versed in the collision of unlike-minded souls that less really is more. Especially given the tragedy that throws them together. Peter and Alison die. And Holly and Eric are left holding the diaper bag and dear baby Sophie (the Clagett triplets Brooke Brynn and Alexis). Though their situation is improbable the two are meant to resonate with many young ambitious parents who find the glue to their nascent relationship becomes a vulnerable kid. Sophie has little choice in the matter of guardians. Her role is to unite bickering personalities in an upscale house not of their choosing in a situation not of their making. Poop finicky eating and first steps figure in. Assorted character actors portray Holly and Erics nosy if concerned neighbors. This nattering clique also feels familiar though Melissa McCarthy is funny as the sweet-tea-frank Deedee. The best surprise comes from of Sarah Burns who portrays the social worker sent to vet the couple. Her characters observations and Burns timing upend the predictable. Duhamel has a mischievous charm that tugs nicely even when hes a bit of a jerk in an undemanding story. Heigl who along with her mother Nancy is one of the films producers delivers her increasingly recognizable mix of off-kilter and sharp-tongued. She does hit a fine sorrowful note when Holly learns her friends have died. A bespectacled babysitter tells the pair -- whove yet to make the leap to the same conclusion -- that they make a cute couple. Our response ""Duh."" Looking good together isnt quite the same thing as having chemistry but romantic comedies so often forget that. ""LIFE AS WE KNOW IT."" PG-13 for sexual material language and some drug content. 1 hour 55 minutes.

By Peter Rainer Film Critic October 8 2010 Save for later Saved Josh Duhamel and Katherine Heigl are shown in a scene from the movie Life as we know it. Warner Bros. Pictures          View Caption About video ads View Caption of ""Why am I watching this on the big screen instead of on TV?"" Thats the question I kept asking myself while watching the new Katherine Heigl comedy ""Life as We Know It."" Its a question Ive been asking myself a lot lately at the movies.The answer of course is that sitcoms long ago gave up television as their primary province. What once was designed for the small screen is now inflated (only slightly) for the big screen. For a bottom-line movie industry loath to risk alienating audiences with something new a big-screen sitcom is the perfect insurance policy. And if its crammed with TV-friendly stars so much the better.Heigl after a stint on ""Greys Anatomy"" is by now a bona fide movie draw; Josh Duhamel her costar in ""Life as We Know It"" is best known for the TV show ""Las Vegas."" His easygoing OK-ness here will probably make him a movie star too. It doesnt take much these days. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Heigl plays Holly a singleton and professional foodie who in a pre-credit sequence endures a very bad blind date with basketball telecaster Eric (Duhamel) who appropriately goes only by his last name Messer. Hes the kind of guy who is busy lining up a new hookup while still on the old one. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Cut ahead three years. When their mutual best friends (played by Christina Hendricks and Hayes MacArthur) are wiped out in a car accident the raising of their baby daughter Sophie (played by a trio of infants) as per the couples will falls to the two nonlovebirds - who had no inkling of their guardian status. To make matters worse they must live together in their friends Atlanta home although the mortgage thoughtfully has already been taken care of.A more contrived and tenuous premise you would be hard-pressed to find although since this is a romantic comedy suspension of disbelief comes with the territory.I would have had a better time suspending my disbelief however if I didnt feel quite so manipulated by the territory. Or if better yet the payoff to all this contrivance was something jollier than a few mild chuckles and an overdose of moments when the director Greg Berlanti overdosing on babykins ballyhoo encourages us to go ""Awwww.""One of the oddities of Heigls movies which also include ""Knocked Up"" and ""27 Dresses"" is that she always seems distinctly overqualified for her role as mopey singleton. Shes supposed to be lovelorn and manless and yet shes made up to look like Grace Kelly. Shes a knockout who thinks shes a wallflower and I suppose this is the essence of her appeal.Sandra Bullock by contrast is or was more like the girl next door. After ""The Blind Side"" shes more like the diva next door. Jennifer Aniston is probably a closer equivalent to Heigl although she doesnt have Heigls mild aura of retro glamour.In any case the point this movie is ultimately trying to make is that it doesnt matter what you look like when youre changing diapers. Babies are equal-opportunity splatterers. ""Life as We Know It"" is as disposable as one of those diapers.

(Peter Iovino/Warner Bros.) Josh Duhamel as Eric Messer and Katherine Heigl as Holly Berenson plus a baby in a scene from Life as We Know It.(Peter Iovino/Warner Bros.) Movie review Life as We Know It Chemistry sparks up this rom-com Add to ... Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 08 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English WHAT IS IT? Two things blended together surprisingly well A rom-com mixed with a baby pic. The first you know about. The second is a bit trickier since babies have a more flexible pedigree in the movie world. Sure sometimes theyre all sweetness and light but just as often theyre not. Hell the tykes frequently get played for sheer horror growing up wicked ( The Bad Seed) or in Rosemarys unfortunate case into the very Devil himself. Even parentless children arent always the helpless victims they seem As Orphan recently proved happy couples who adopt may not be happy for long. KATHERINE HEIGL 40 watts Heigl needs a hit more than Ashton Kutcher needs marriage counselling. The last movie both were in Killers died at the box office. With the pressure on from her previous successes The Ugly Truth and 27 Dresses can the 31-year-old actress get her rom-com mojo back with Life as We Know It? Celebrity The Wattage Meter How bright are these stars shining? By contrast for unhappy couples and for narcissistic singles the baby usually reverts to cliched type becoming just the bouncing bundle of joy needed to put their rancorous or solipsistic or misguidedly ambitious lives back on the track to Pleasantville. Here the adults are the horrible screw-ups and the kid is the comic saviour. So it was for Diane Keaton in Baby Boom. And so it is in Life As We Know It. HOW DOES IT WORK? Well the rom gets put in the com even before the credits roll when Holly and Eric (Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel) venture out on a blind date and quickly face the impediment to romance They cant stand each other. Shes an uptight lady and hes an easygoing lady-killer. Happily this mutual hatred is matched only by their shared love for mutual friends a married couple with yes a newborn named Sophie. Unhappily said couple die in a car accident a tragic intrusion that lasts only long enough to set the premise Their will appoints guess-which-twosome as co-guardians of the orphaned child. But please dont mistake this gooey premise for a TV sitcom; in fact it was a TV movie - back in 2004 and called Raising Waylon. From there of course its the babys job to prove to the hitherto disdainful duo that they really love each other. During that altogether predictable process its our job to laugh as the insta-parents contend with the inevitable poopy diapers and sleepless nights and crying fits (some of them even by Sophie). Were also obliged to act worried when further complications arise to thwart their union - like her interest in Sam the good doctor or his in taking a job in another city. But heres the nice surprise Our part of the bargain is a lot easier to uphold than we might have thought. Why? Partly because the dialogue is an occasionally witty cut above the norm partly because director Greg Berlanti goes easy on those cute baby reaction shots but mainly because of something rather more valuable screen chemistry. DOES IT MATTER? In movie rom-coms in movies generally chemistry always matters. Heigl and Duhamel spark off each other quite brightly. Now such chemical equations are often ineffable and hard to parse but in this match my best guess is that shes the explosive sulphur to his wooden hunk. After all even when hunk-less even when paired with Seth Rogen in Knocked Up Heigl still managed to generate some heat all the while flashing not inconsiderable gifts as a comic actor. Those gifts dont get fully tapped here but theyre not entirely wasted either. So voila. If innocuous entertainment amiable enough while it lasts but forgettable beyond has a place in life as you know it then Life As We Know It will have a place in your heart.

"Life as We Know It | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; life-as-we-know-it ) Life as We Know It (United States 2010) October 07 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli The best thing that can be said about Life as We Know It is that it gets some of the details right when it comes to the experience of sharing a home with an infant. Still all the poop vomit sleepless nights and cute joyous little moments cant make up for the fact that the framework is constructed out of artifice. Cloying and at times annoying Life as We Know It is egregiously manipulative whoring itself out for a few unearned tears. In fact although it poses as a story about the love of (adoptive) parents for a child its really little more than a standard-order romantic comedy. The proof is in the ending with the final ten-or-so minutes being copied chapter and verse from the Romantic Comedy Playbook. Isnt anyone else tired of having so many movies of this ilk climaxing in airports? For Holly Berenson (Katherine Heigl) and Eric Messer (Josh Duhamel) its hate - or at least disdain - at first sight. Oil and water they never get beyond her curb on their first blind date which is set up by their mutual best friends Peter and Alison Novack (Hayes MacArthur and Christina Hendricks). However even though the romantic angle doesnt work out their orbits nevertheless intersect frequently most often because of Peter Alison and their one-year old daughter Sophie. Then tragedy strikes. Peter and Alison are killed in a car accident. Their will gives joint custody to Holly and Eric forcing the two to move into Peter and Alisons house and work out complementary schedules that allow them to care for the little girl and maintain their careers - running a catering business for Holly and directing basketball game telecasts for Messer. Of course there are conflicts but their mutual desire to provide Sophie with a stable home keeps them together. Hate turns to love and Life as We Know It falls into the ""been there done that"" dA(c)jA  vu groove. I think there might be a good movie in here somewhere but director Greg Berlanti (whose filmography consists primarily of TV episode screenplays) never uncovers it. Life as We Know It touches on the impossible situation of being thrown into the guardianship of a child before one is ready for it and of the struggle to merge career personal life and the babys well-being. The production takes no risks however. The animosity between Holly and Messer is cartoonish and the situation is reduced to a number of sit-com-influenced skits. The ever-helpful neighbors are represented by usual suspects. Weve seen them all before in other movies (albeit played by different actors). Everything about Life as We Know It feels recycled. Because it is. Berlanti tries far too hard to get us to feel. His over-the-top manipulation is so obvious that its a turnoff. He obviously has no faith that the situation on its own is worthy of tears or smiles or both so he stacks the deck with frequent close-ups of a crying baby or a giggling baby (as the situation demands). Early in the movie there are also frequent reminders of the late great parents. And theres the obligatory scene in which Holly becomes the recipient of the babys first ""Mama."" As Life as We Know it enters its second half Sophie becomes a prop in the escalating romantic tension between Holly and Messer. Too bad the ""tension"" gets left on the pages of the script; it certainly doesnt turn up on screen. I have yet to decide whether Katherine Heigl is a bad actress or merely a lazy one but with the possible exception of Knocked Up she plays every role in the same manner. Her characters are all interchangeable. And boring. Maybe if I cared a little more about Holly or viewed her as more than a blonde attractive caricature the directors crass manipulation might have seemed more heartfelt. Josh Duhamel is fine - his is a restrained laid-back performance. The only drawback is that theres never any connection between his Messer and Heigls Holly. Josh Lucas who normally plays the romantic lead is trapped in the role of the ""other guy"" which means hes destined to end up without the girl at the end. The movie mistakenly makes him a better match for Holly than Messer. Savvy movie-goers however will never doubt whos going to be with whom when the end credits roll. Life as We Know It clocks in at an unwarranted 115 minutes which is about 30 minutes too long for something this formulaic. The extra half-hour allows additional screen time to be granted to the annoying neighbors provides an opening for the pointless relationship between Holly and Sam to be developed and gives the NBA multiple product placement opportunities. Admittedly most parents (new or old) are going to encounter some familiar moments during the course of Life as We Know It but theyre the kind of obvious non-insightful interludes that will generate little more than a knowing nod from the viewer. Thats a poor reason to see a movie that is otherwise so deeply flawed.

"Life As We Know It (Baby) formula but entertaining | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesLife As We Know It (Baby) formula but entertainingLike the clunker you end up buying and liking in spite of everything the romantic comedy Life As We Know It gets you there.Katherine Heigl faces instand parenthood with Life As We Know It.  (HANDOUT)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Oct. 7 2010 Life As We Know It (out of 4) Starring Katherine Heigl Josh Duhamel Josh Lucas and Sarah Burns. Directed by Greg Berlanti. At major theatres. 112 minutes. PG Life As We Know It comes with more qualifiers than a used car. It begins with implausibility and then tragedy before lurching towards romantic comedy. And the two main characters played by Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel are harder to warm up to than a cold bed. The story is highly predictable -- when its not being downright absurd -- and also shamelessly manipulative. It combines the accidental parenthood of Knocked Up with the romantic triangle and baked goods of Its Complicated without improving on either of those movies. But just like the clunker you end up buying and liking in spite of everything Life As We Know It gets you there. Exactly where is hard to say but chances are you wont regret making the journey. It has some distance to travel right at the start by immediately establishing Josh Duhamels Eric Messer (everybody calls him Messer) as the blind date from hell. He shows up at the Atlanta abode of Holly Berenson (Heigl) an hour late dressed like a slob and shrugging off his failure to make a restaurant reservation. He then proceeds to take a booty call from another girl making little attempt to disguise what hes doing. The justifiably outraged Holly calls him a word that rhymes with ""gas hole"" and swears never again to let her best friends Alison and Peter (Mad Mens Christina Hendricks and Hayes MacArthur) set her up on a date. Can this relationship be saved? Why would anyone care? And that would seem to be that. But it turns out that Messer is also best buds with Alison and Peter. He and Holly are obliged to be civil towards each other when they meet for occasions such as the birthday of Sophie their friends bouncing baby daughter. The forced civility becomes serious when fate tragically conspires to make Holly and Messer the guardians of Sophie with the further proviso that they must live under the same roof. This latter requirement may be the toughest thing of all because Holly is tightly wound and Messer really is a selfish rhymes-with-gas-hole. Are you buying this so far? Its impossible to fathom a couple choosing two single people who hate each other as child guardians and doing so without consulting with them first. And neither Holly a baker and aspiring restaurateur nor Messer a TV director for the Atlanta Hawks basketball team has shown the slightest interest in parenthood. (Its a situation Heigl would certainly recall from Knocked Up when she played a TV professional suddenly made pregnant by a lout.) So imagine the surprise of Holly and Messer when they are confronted with a squawling infant explosively soiled diapers babysitting emergencies and Fisher-Price toys strewn dangerously around the house. Of such ideas are so-so sitcoms made but then director Greg Berlanti comes by it honestly having arrived here by way of the tube. He and screenwriters Ian Deitchman and Kristin Rusk Robinson mine every last nugget of the motherlode (and fatherlode) of new-parent traumas which are often funny even if completely unoriginal. Minor twists ensue when Josh Lucas enters the picture to provide romantic distraction for Heigl reminding us all too clearly of the recent romcom hit Its Complicated which starred Meryl Streep as a baker mom with one too many suitors. Lucas actually says ""Its complicated"" at one point and Life has the brass to steal that films funniest scene where a couple gets stoned and silly. About the only thing that Life doesnt rip from another film is the busybody social worker character played by Sarah Burns who is constantly making surprise visits to Holly and Messer to assess their suitability as parents. She may be the only person in doubt as to how this arrangement is going to end up although it takes nearly two hours to do so about 20 minutes too long. Still Heigl and Duhamel wear well. Theyre not exactly Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn but neither are they chopped liver. As accidental parents go they go pretty well together making this Life worth knowing at least until the next diaper change.

Seems the Lone Ranger and Tonto are surrounded by angry Indians on the warpath. ""It looks like were in real trouble now Tonto"" says the Lone Ranger. To which Tonto replies ""What do you mean we paleface?"" After watching this silly cliche-ridden -- and yet more than slightly alien -- romantic comedy you might feel a similar urge to disavow membership in the club suggested by its all-embracing title. Whose life are we talking about exactly? Although the words are meant to suggest the universality of the human condition -- Were all in this mess together huh pal? -- theres really only one tiny group of people on the planet for whom the ""life"" as depicted in ""Life As We Know It"" will feel the least bit recognizable Hollywood movie producers. I can almost hear the pitch meeting now Theres this married couple with a baby see? And then one day the couple dies in a tragic car accident leaving their adorably orphaned 1-year-old daughter in the care of her hot single godparents. Except the godparents -- Im thinking Josh Duhamel and Katherine Heigl here -- never even knew about let alone agreed to this arrangement in the first place. The beauty part? They hate each others guts Sounds like your life right? Actually it doesnt sound any less plausible than the sitcom proposed by George on ""Seinfeld"" way back when in which a judge sentences an uninsured motorist to be Georges butler -- his butler for Gods sake -- after a traffic accident. Hey it could happen. Conveniently enough there are no blood relatives who can take in the kid other than one cousin whos a stripper another who already has nine children and a grandfather on an oxygen tank. That leaves Holly Berenson (Heigl) and Eric Messer (Duhamel) -- or ""Mess"" as he is aptly known -- to move in together and try to make the best of a stupid situation. Hes a a womanizing pig who works in the TV control booth for a professional Atlanta sports team. Shes a nurturing homebody who runs a gourmet store and bake shop like the one Meryl Streep had in ""Its Complicated."" Neither one knows the first thing about changing diapers. Like weve never seen that before. Brace yourself though. The movie has more excrement jokes than the typical rom-com. Messers characterization of one particularly nasty diaper -- ""Its like Slumdog Millionaire in there"" -- is one of the movies funnier lines. Otherwise the script (by first-time feature writers Ian Deitchman and Kristin Rusk Robinson) is not especially original zingy or insightful. Fortunately both Holly and Messer are incredibly hot. Which means that in accordance with the physical laws of the known hot universe they must be together certain plot contrivances notwithstanding. Hollys dalliance with an earnest but only semi-hot pediatrician (Josh Lucas) and Messers brief escape to a new job in Phoenix only serve to prolong the inevitable fusion of nuclear hotness made all the more cloying by the addition of a cute baby. At nearly two hours the movie feels bloated. It could easily lose 30 minutes give or take and live. It would still not however live up to its title.Contains obscenity drug use sensuality and poop humor.

Predicating an escapist romantic comedy on a realistic tragedy requires a nimble touch at the helm. Perhaps if Life had been made by say James Brooks it would have worked. As written by Ian Deitchman and Kristin Rusk Robinson the film offers predictable laughs before and after a jarring accident that is anything but funny. Duhamel plays Messer a handsome womanizer and the best friend of Peter (Hayes MacArthur) who is happily married to Alison (Christina Hendricks). Heigl plays the uptight ambitious Holly Alisons best friend. TRAILER Get a sense of Life Heigl essentially plays the same role she did in The Ugly Truth and Knocked Up. Messer and Holly are what pass for an odd couple in Hollywoods superficial rom-com terms attractive and intelligent but with polarized character traits and cliched dating habits. The filmmakers at least sidestepped the ""date from hell"" scene that has been done to death. But they indulge in enough musical montages and the familiar climactic race to the airport to make up for their prior restraint. The broad comedy is undercut by bursts of melodrama. The first such moment comes early when Peter and Alison are killed in a car crash. Neither character was drawn fully enough so we mourn their loss as much as we feel Messer and Hollys grief. But thats set aside when they learn that they are guardians for Peter and Alisons baby Sophie. Though they despise each other Messer and Holly must take up residence in their friends home and be co-parents. Look Whos Talking-type humor kicks in with the requisite baby vomit and a particularly gross twist on dirty diapers. Though parents can find some relatable material here theres nothing terribly original presented. Duhamels boyish charm and comic timing make the biggest impression. He has a winning sort of subtle self-mockery that works particularly well when the neighbors -- male and female -- fall all over him. Its a spotty movie that at least attempts to ground its story in reality. The booze and weed situations and the potty humor provide silly slapstick gags while the story takes too long to reach its obvious conclusion. The main premise is hard to swallow. Neither of their friends found a moment to tell Holly or Messer -- or better yet ask them -- about being guardians? The tragedy feels trumped-up so the movie can find a fresh way to make opposites attract. When the unlikely duo ends up in an amorous encounter Holly muses ""I wonder if they planned this."" As if a couple would be so selfless as to sacrifice their lives just so their best friends could get together. Then again martyrdom as a date movie concept is at least something fresh in a tired genre.

Weinstein Company By Joe Morgenstern Updated Oct. 8 2010 1201 a.m. ET In ""Nowhere Boy"" a modest and enjoyable account of the young John Lennon (who would have been 70 this week) the camera glances fleetingly at a small ""Strawberry Field"" sign in front of a Liverpool house. What would we have thought of Sam Taylor-Woods debut feature if the fruit of the sign had been blueberry or if the heros touchingly young band mate had been a kid named Peter instead of Paul? We might still have found her film to be modest and enjoyable albeit less resonant a coming-of-age drama about a gifted youngster caught in a no-boys land between a stern aunt who raises him and a loving mom whos too tormented to mother him. ""Nowhere Boy"" a movie that chronicles John Lennons life. More Yoko Ono on Nowhere Boy Aaron Johnson on Playing John Lennon in Nowhere Boy John is played by Aaron Johnson who makes him a strong presence and a credible one. You can imagine that Lennons prodigious outpouring of pop poetry--the movie ends before the Quarrymen became the Beatles--was beginning to form in the fertile mind of this likable 15-year-old with a cocky facade and a tender soul. The creative process is almost audible in a silent moment when John turns an adoring gaze on the curvaceous body of his first guitar. (The reliably fine shooter Seamus McGarvey did the cinematography.) The script adapted by Matt Greenhalgh from a memoir by Lennons half-sister Julia Baird is flagrantly Oedipal; almost every scene between John and his mother is sexually charged. The curse is taken off most of these encounters by Anne-Marie Duffs eloquent work in the mothers role--beautiful as a seductress in spite of herself affecting as a woman with a wild childs impulses. And ""Nowhere Boy"" which was directed by a woman gives another enviable role to the brilliant Kristin Scott Thomas. Her Aunt Mimi isnt beautiful at least on the outside she buries her features beneath thick powder marches around in dowdy clothes and looks old beyond her years. When the time comes for truths to be told though Ms. Scott Thomas fires off volleys of passion that transform Mimi from a prim martinet into a powerfully loving influence in Johns life. ENLARGE Above right Ms. Scott Thomas and Sergi Lopez in Leaving. IFC Films Leaving Kristin Scott Thomas is the best though not the only reason to see ""Leaving."" Catherine Orsinis French-language drama starts with a departure that isnt what it seems to be. The actress looks exceedingly beautiful as Suzanne a doctors wife and devoted mother who once had her own career as a physical therapist. After 15 years of domesticity she hopes to revive her practice as soon as a builder finishes work on her home office. But shes taken out of her comfortable bourgeois life by the builder instead of the office (his name is Ivan and hes played by the excellent Spanish actor Sergi Lopez.) ""It hit me"" Suzanne tells her husband in an effort to explain her uncontrollable passion ""I didnt ask for it."" Nor did she ask for the trials that ensue. For a triangular tale with a familiar premise this compact feature which was written by the director with Gaelle Mace proves to be uncommonly interesting. (And beautifully photographed by Agnes Godard with long shots that tell more than most movies close-ups.) Suzannes folie damour slowly changes to a folly of another sort while her love for the hard-working Ivan comes up against chilling issues of class. Along the way Ms. Scott Thomas finds or creates lovely moments like the one when Suzanne tells Ivan teasingly that she wont leave his bed unless he tells her to then realizes to her quiet astonishment that she truly doesnt want to go. Life as We Know It Opposite singles who have a strong mutual dislike for each other are unexpectedly thrust together when their best friends die and the couple leaves their daughter 1 in their friends guardianship. In the wonderful world of tell-all trailers you dont have to see ""Life as We Know It"" to know what its about or how the story is worked out. As the website reveals--nay proclaims--Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel have a first date from hell followed by the discovery that the friends who introduced them have died and left a will designating them as the ones to raise their baby daughter. If that sounds ever so slightly contrived you might be a candidate for the online excerpts. Turning on your computer costs a lot less than two tickets to a multiplex and you dont have to worry about gum on the floor. If you insist on investigating the big-screen version be forewarned that the charming co-stars--shes a gifted comedienne and hes skillful too--contend against coarse direction as well as the clanking machinery of the plot. The movie will surely find an audience since it speaks to young peoples anxieties about marriage and parenting. But what are two particularly engaging performers doing in a dump of a comedy like this? ENLARGE Diane Lane and John Malkovich in Secretariat. Disney Enterprises Secretariat More Why Malkovich Is Fun to Watch A family film about one of the fastest racehorses in history ""Secretariat"" stumbles along beneath the weight of leaden life lessons. Theyre dispensed at frequent intervals by Diane Lane who does better than anyone had a right to expect since she is saddled with dialogue of exceptional dreadfulness. Ms. Lane plays Penny Chenery the owner of the Triple Crown winner a Colorado housewife and mother who in the 1970s took over a Virginia stable from her ailing father. (John Malkovich dispenses some of his trademarked acting tricks as Lucien Laurin the horses French-Canadian trainer.) The lessons are feminist in a narrow sense though theyre meant to be broadly inspirational--never give up run your race to see how far you can run etc. etc. As if the script werent clumsy enough the movie even mangles a wordless moment when Penny seeks to inspire her hay burner by looking him in the eye. His eyes are dead while her barely suppressed desperation makes her look like a horse wheedler. Tamara Drewe A young newspaper writer returns to her hometown in the English countryside where her childhood home is being prepped for sale. ""Tamara Drewe"" makes a strong case for rhinoplasty and a stronger one for the pleasures of comedy. This bucolic frolic was directed with unflagging elan by Stephen Frears from a script with a layered lineage Moira Buffini adapted a graphic novel by Posy Simmonds which was in its turn a contemporary riff on Thomas Hardys ""Far From the Madding Crowd."" The heroine of the title returns to the Wessex village of her birth with a cute new nose and newfound confidence to go with it. Once an ugly duckling known to the locals as Beaky she is now absurdly glamorous and given the unchained nature of her id extremely dangerous. (Its hard to visualize an outsize schnoz on Gemma Arterton the lovely actress who plays her but flashbacks to Tamaras childhood help.) The storys literary underpinnings are hilariously represented by the denizens of a seedy writers retreat situated near Tamaras old house which she has come back to reclaim after her mothers death. Some denizens are dazzled by her charms others are undone by them. I found myself rooting for Tamara to reconnect in the deepest way with handsome Andy her childhood friend--Luke Evans makes him a son of the soil who would have had Hardys vote--and I was shocked by her home-wrecking exploits with a fatuous scrivener though her heedlessness is exactly the point. The scintillating cast includes Roger Allam Bill Camp and Tamsin Greig. Dominic Cooper is a fatuous rock star and Jessica Barden is a wondrously funny teenager and slatternly deus ex machina who adores him. A dog named Boss--the credits say hes played by Albert Clark so make of that what you will--has the dubious distinction of turning a placid herd of Belted Galloway cows into killers. Inside Job If Charles Fergusons polemic documentary were merely depressing it could take its place alongside the dreariest of downer dramas from Bulgaria or the former East Germany. But ""Inside Job"" has the added value as well as the cold comfort of being furiously interesting and hugely infuriating. Its a scathing examination of the global economic meltdown that began more than two years ago and continues to affect our lives. Takes a closer look at what brought about the financial meltdown in the movie ""Inside Job."" Extremely cold comfort can be taken from the case that serves as an introduction. ""There is nobody unaffected in Iceland"" we are told. Well before 2008 that small island nation privatized its banks; then economists paid by the Icelandic Chamber of Commerce wrote reports that praised the perilously fragile banking system. But no nation is an island these days. Cataclysmic events that began with the collapse of Lehman Brothers and AIG sent concentric tsunamis around the globe and the film reserves special fury for its contention that ""this crisis was not an accident--it was caused by an out-of-control financial sector."" (Mr. Fergusons co-writers were Chad Beck and Adam Bolt. Matt Damon delivers the narration with seething calm.) As circumstantial evidence ""Inside Job"" puts the toys of that sectors beneficiaries on display--the private jets the horses the houses and yachts--and lays out some of the astronomical salaries theyve received as rewards for failure as well as success. But Mr. Ferguson also provides historical context for his provocations--the savings-and-loan crisis of the 1980s the steady march of deregulation the advent of exotic derivatives. Iceland isnt the only place where the film contends the financial industry ""has corrupted the study of economics itself."" Among others interviewed on the subject Glenn Hubbard dean of Columbia Universitys Graduate School of Business is unresponsive and visibly shaken during a withering interrogation about his connections to financial-services firms. And the Obama administration gets as much of a drubbing as any other ""Its a Wall Street government"" a former president of the Greenlining Institute says. ""Its status quo."" After seeing ""Inside Job"" you dont have to be a tea partier to feel the anger thats sweeping the land. Its Kind of a Funny Story A clinically depressed teenager gets a new start after he checks himself into an adult psychiatric ward in the movie ""Its Kind of a Funny Story."" Think of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest"" blissed out on Wellbutrin and youve got a slight sense of ""Its Kind of a Funny Story."" The film itself is fairly slight Im not sure what it adds up to. Still I enjoyed every moment of its beguiling saga of a depressed teen named Craig who checks himself into a Manhattan hospital and ends up in an adult psychiatric ward full of wouldnt you know it screwy people. The directors were Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck; they adapted the screenplay from Ned Vizzinis young-adult novel. Craig is played by Keir Gilchrist from ""United States of Tara""; hes got a sweet spirit and a cockeyed Paul Simon smile. Of the patients he meets the most appealing is Noelle (Emma Roberts) and the most mysterious--and funny surprising and touching--is Bobby whos played with sensational verve by Zach Galifianakis. From time to time theres a bit of Mickey and Judy putting on mental illness; these arent tragic figures and arent meant to be. But Craig eventually comes to a useful understanding of where he belongs in the spectrum of human suffering. Id like to think of this graceful little movie as a fantasy about empathy as therapy.

Bailey (c) 2010 Focus Features Review Its Kind of a Funny Story has charm 1 / 4 Back to Gallery Its Kind of a Funny Story Comedy-drama. Starring Keir Gilchrist Zach Galifianakis and Emma Roberts. Directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck. (PG-13. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) A depressed teenager checks himself into a mental ward sees how crazy everybody else is - ""My beds on fire"" - and feels suddenly cured. But he finds out that no sorry he cannot leave. He must stay for a legally mandated five days. When he is told this he is understandably crestfallen and so are we in the audience. We know If hes not getting out were not either and at first the prospect of a long stretch doesnt seem promising. How on earth will he fill the time? How will the filmmakers? How will the audience? And then gradually what seems awful becomes human what seems foreign becomes familiar and about halfway into this sincere and surprisingly lovable movie a vacation feeling sets in. He doesnt want to leave and neither do we. Based on the novel by Ned Vizzini and written and directed by the team that created ""Half Nelson"" Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck ""Its Kind of a Funny Story"" ambles along and has a feeling of randomness about it but in fact its tightly plotted. Every moment however seemingly haphazard and casually presented is keyed to the progress of a young man from lost to not so lost. The possible pitfalls are many. First of all they have to make us believe it Pep talks dont cure depression and neither do fleeting moments of exhilaration or even insight. So the incidents presented have to be both authentic in a quotidian sort of way and yet slyly and convincingly transformative. ""Its Kind of a Funny Story"" isnt flashy but it gets there. The journey is aided immeasurably by the casting of Keir Gilchrist as young Craig. He has dark sensitive eyes and a probity about him that wins you to his side and makes you believe that this is one valuable kid. Gilchrist though in no way self-indulgent or self-consciously theatrical just has one of those faces that shows every calibration of thought and emotion. He can use this quality dramatically or comedically as the occasion demands. This is a seriously talented young actor. The presence of Zach Galifianakis in the cast might lead people to assume that the movie is funnier than it is. But ""Its Kind of a Funny Story"" is more of a drama with some laughs than a comedy with funny parts and Galifianakis role as a husband and father who has fought suicidal depression his whole life is a sober one. Bobby (Galifianakis) takes the newbie under his wing and in a droll but straight-faced way shows him around. The movie taps into a curious truth about life and a particular variety of relationship that exists in the world but thats rarely if ever depicted in movies Theres a special mentoring bond that can sometimes develop between a thoroughly screwed-up adult and a slightly less screwed-up teenager. No matter how screwed up the adult is he knows more than the kid. And the kid so used to being lectured by functioning members of the older generation feels less intimidated and more able to learn from this kind of older person. A beautiful thing in this film which is fairly lovely throughout is the way Galifianakis looks at Gilchrist. On the surface he looks impassive but theres a lot behind that gaze Knowing amusement a certain impatience and most of all a longing to be back at that stage of life again before the mistakes were made and with every possibility still available. Not everything in ""Its Kind of a Funny Story"" cuts that deep but neither does it cut corners and Craigs blossoming friendship with a teenage girl (Emma Roberts) is especially well played and genuine. -- Advisory Drug talk sexual situations and mature themes.

Three years later when they are named foster parents to Sophie said friends orphaned infant Holly and Messer take baby steps toward adulthood.With pratfalls and teardrops the film swings from sitcom to sit-dram. Will two singles who hate hate hate each other lovingly coparent a child? Will Sophie make Holly more forgiving and Messer more responsible? Will this movie be another slice of Heigl processed cheese?The film from Greg Berlanti (TVs Brothers amp; Sisters) strains to appeal equally to girlie women and manly boys by making its leads the extreme examples of each type.Heigl has wonderfully offbeat timing but is typecasting herself by repeatedly playing the Type A personality with man trouble (see Knocked Up 27 Dresses The Ugly Truth).Duhamel whose shambling manner recalls that of Shaggy in the Scooby-Doo cartoons is a pleasant surprise. Unlike Heigl he handles the demands of slapstick comedy and sobbing drama without appearing to suffer from mood swings.The same cannot be said of the script by Ian Deitchman and Kristin Rusk Robinson simultaneously edgy and mushy. The films abrupt shifts of sentiment blunt its edge and make lumpy its mush.As a social worker paying home visits Sarah Burns is quite droll. Likewise Melissa McCarthy as a neighbor with a devoted husband and a crush on Messer.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

"Movie review Life as We Know It - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Baby BoomMovie review Life as We Know ItKatherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel are appealing as a dating couple trying to figure out their relationship when a baby is tossed into the mix.October 08 2010|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Romantic comedies are usually all about what is keeping the couple apart a the distance in ""Sleepless in Seattle"" the friendship in ""When Harry Met Sally"" the fiancA(c) in ""My Best Friends Wedding."" In the likeable ""Life as We Know It"" starring Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel its all about whats keeping them uncomfortably together. That would be a bottle-hugging diaper-wearing adorable moppet named Sophie the baby they inherited after their best friends were killed in an accident. With that premise a which has been trotted out in an ad blitz of massive proportions but irritatingly takes forever to get to when the movie actually starts a you know this film is not going to be all laughs. What you may not expect is quite how satisfying much of the film is with Duhamel turning out to be a very good sparring partner for Heigl whose lush soft exterior conceals a very spiky interior that tends to wilt her co-stars in these sorts of romantic escapades. Heigl is Holly a planner and baker extraordinaire with hopes of turning her gourmet cafA(c) into a restaurant eventually a chain maybe become a mogul for good measure. Duhamel is Messer which about says it all but just to add a little perspective hes a behind-the-camera TV guy who dreams of directing sports broadcasts from one of those booths filled with monitors and other Messer-like dudes. We quickly find out that Messer is a briefs not boxers kind of guy and he spends much of his screen time in them or in sweaty jock stuff. Both are excellent looks for him but thats just an extra perk because hes actually more than eye candy. Holly and Messer meet ugly rather than cute a on a blind date set up by their happily paired best friends Alison and Peter (played by Christina Hendricks and Hayes MacArthur). Everything goes so wrong they dont even make it out of the parking space. Over the years Holly and Messer turn up at all those milestone events Alison and Peter celebrate a marriage Sophies birth first birthday then the funeral that also comes with a will and the guardianship wishes for their baby girl. Director Greg Berlanti who has enough teary TV drama under his belt to keep ""Titanic"" afloat knows how to do weepies well. (And I say that as a fan of both ""Brother amp; Sisters"" and ""Everwood"" sob.) But what always carries him is his way with human connections and disconnections. That talent kicks in once ""Life as We Know It"" gets into the meat of the story which is about all the complications of making a complicated relationship work. Thats where the film is at its best. Though there are echoes of ""How do you diaper a baby?"" that played out so well in the long-ago ""Baby Boom"" (with Diane Keatons Tiger Lady weighing her unexpected arrival in the produce section of the grocery store) the question of whether to parent Sophie is not much of a debate here. Its all about how which says something fundamental about the pendulum swing on the whole yuppie parenting issue. The most salient theme running through the film is that balancing act between career and family that couples everywhere face. Since this is a family of someone elses making the going is rougher for Holly and Messer and accounts for most of the comic tension the film mines. To make matters better and worse there is a tightly wound child-services worker whos evaluating their parenting skills and a gaggle of neighbors a couples with lots of kids and even more advice led by the seriously funny Melissa McCarthy a born scene-stealer. And a ""baby whisperer"" of a babysitter a delightfully serious Britt Flatmo. With the film set in Atlanta there are a lot of warm Southern accents floating around and cinematographer Andrew Dunn keeps the look of the film equally cozy. Still the central question that must be answered before the lights come up is will they or wont they fall in love. The issue is made more difficult (and in a sense easier) by the fact that both are not just free to date but expected to. On that front we have Hollys interest in Sam ( Josh Lucas) the handsome doctor who stops by her cafe in the mornings and turns out to be Sophies pediatrician a what are the chances? Meanwhile Messer has a string of nameless flings to distract him until a really big one comes along in the form of a dream job in another city. That you find yourself rooting for Holly and Messer to work it out for each other as much as for Sophie is a tribute to a smart script by Ian Deitchman and Kristin Rusk Robinson a their first to be produced after about a decade in the pitching/writing trenches. The battles that rage the frustrations that boil over all have a very authentic feel. There are a few false notes near the beginning particularly the regrettably flirtatious exchange at the attorneys office when Holly and Messer learn that Sophie has been entrusted to their care. But the film quickly finds its footing and tackles the serious business of making a family work. Ultimately ""Life as We Know It"" is messy at times rough around the edges too but worth hanging in there to see how it all turns out. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESFergie Josh Duhamel have a baby boyAugust 29 2013Josh Duhamel reveals wife Fergie is having a baby boyJuly 16 2013Fergie is pregnant expecting baby with Josh DuhamelFebruary 18 2013MORE STORIES ABOUTBaby BoomJosh DuhamelBaby GirlCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-life-as-we-know-it-20101008,0,7128513.story",200,lifeasweknowit14,lifeasweknowit,latimes

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Life as We Know It gives bland and predictable a good name. The story of a mismatched couple learning to live and love when theyre forced to raise their friends newly orphaned baby its the kind of date-night fluff that Hollywood regularly cranks out to keep the suburban multiplexes and Netflix queues humming. Pure product. But where the current ""You Again or star Katherine Heigls last few films (""The Ugly Truth ""Killers) are crass and generally hateful ""Life is one of the better mass-produced greeting cards out there. Its brisk pleasantly acted painless. These days thats high praise.Heigl partially redeems herself as Holly Berenson an Atlanta caterer and singleton pushing 30; its the same old role but at least the screenwriters dont regard her unmarried status with complete horror. Shes a sympathetic neat freak who barely survives a disastrous blind date with Eric Messer (Josh Duhamel) a cocky slob of a sports TV technician. Why their mutual friends Peter and Alison (Hayes MacArthur and Christina Hendricks) thought theyd click is a mystery to these two and to anyone who has never seen a Hollywood romantic comedy before.Peter and Alison then have the temerity to get killed in a discreet off-screen car crash leaving their 1-year-old daughter Sophie (played by triplets Alexis Brynn and Brooke Clagett) in the care of Holly and Messer. Youre probably asking the same questions I did Arent there any other relatives? Where will the couple live? How long before they cave in to the inevitable? The movie answers these amusingly and in the context almost believably.What we have then is Oscar and Felix stuck in a suburban mansion with a kid except that Felix is a woman and Oscar is a hunk. ""Life as We Know It gets as much comic mileage as it can out of the nosy neighbors -- the husbands griping about their lost sleep and expanding waistlines the wives (and one gay husband) waiting by their front doors for when Messer goes jogging shirtless -- and it deploys its subsidiary characters efficiently. Sarah Burns gets off a few good deadpan reaction shots as a Child Services caseworker and Faizon Love is very funny as a cab driver pressed into service as a baby sitter.And theres Josh Lucas as the movies Mr. Dreamboat a divorced pediatrician who woos Holly and stands as much chance of getting her as Ralph Bellamy stood of getting the girl in any of his movies with Cary Grant. Not that Duhamel is Cary Grant but hes likable enough under the circumstances and he plays well with Heigl. Theyre a good match even if their chemistry doesnt quite expand to fill the big screen.Everything about ""Life as We Know It feels TV-size actually which makes sense given director Greg Berlantis extensive experience writing and producing network series (""Everwood ""Brothers amp; Sisters). That extends to the depressingly generic suburban settings and home decor the coffee-bar cover versions of well-known songs -- if youre going to use ""Pump It Up you may as well pay for the Elvis Costello original -- the over-lit actors and the occasionally slipshod camerawork. You may enjoy the movie even if you know where its heading at any given moment but this is not life as we know it. Its life as we know it from television.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

We Know It already Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday October 7 2010 212 PM facebook Tweet email Life As We Know It stars Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel in roles they have played numerous times before. (Peter Iovino) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday October 7 2010 212 PM Title Life as We Know It Romantic dramedy about two unlikely parents. With Katherine Heigl Josh Duhamel. Director Greg Berlanti (155). PG-13 language sexuality drugs. At area theaters.You wont find a more aptly titled movie than ""Life as We Know It"" which veers not an inch off Hollywoods well-worn rom-com path. Weve met Katherine Heigls tightly wound character countless times before. Were all familiar with the aging frat boy played by Josh Duhamel. And we can predict exactly when why and how theyll connect because by now we know this story inside out.As she proved in ""27 Dresses"" Heigl can be enjoyable to watch. But for reasons that presumably remain between her and her therapist she prefers to portray rigid high-strung women no one wants to be around.Certainly thats true of Eric Messer (Duhamel) a committed bachelor well into his 30s. Years ago Eric and Holly (Heigl) went on a miserable blind date arranged by their friend Alison (Christina Hendricks wasted in this role).Despite this disastrous experience Alison secretly chose these sworn enemies as guardians for her baby Sophie (Alexis Brynn and Brooke Clagett). If youre wondering why youre already too cynical for the movie. And you certainly wont appreciate the rest of this misjudged scenario in which Alison and her husband are swiftly killed off in a car accident.When little Sophie is orphaned Eric and Holly are stunned to learn they have to raise her together. We however can guess immediately how this arrangement works out through stages one (fighting about diaper changes) two (bonding over sleep deprivation) and three (will they? wont they?).The supporting cast tries hard to create some fun with Melissa McCarthy especially amusing as a nosy neighbor. And Josh Lucas is appealing as Sophies cute pediatrician. But films like this are really about the highly paid leads two impossibly attractive actors mimicking real life.Unfortunately its hard to generate chemistry when you dont remotely resemble an actual human being. Duhamel ambles through his cliched role and though Heigl attempts to add some dimension the assembly line script gives her little room to breathe.On the other hand the sisters who play Sophie are adorable. And if you happen to be a sleep-deprived parent yourself there are worse ways to catch a two-hour nap.eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

But romantic comedy is all about the formula. Life as We Know It Fair Director Greg Berlanti. Cast Katherine Heigl Josh Duhamel Josh Lucas. Rating PG-13 for sexual material language and some drug content. Journalism in the movies Chick flicks Guys as caretakers Sure every once in a while a movie will play with the genres conventions without a happily-ever-after ending as in ""The Break-Up"" and ""(500) Days of Summer."" But these rare exceptions merely underline the rule. In ""Life as We Know It"" we find Katherine Heigl Hollywoods current quirky/feisty heroine out of central casting clinging to the last shreds of her A-list status after a string of commercial and/or critical flops. This time out shes in a cleaned-up (or dumbed-down) version of her funniest film ""Knocked Up."" Instead of a one-night stand its a fatal car accident that forces her into a co-parenting situation with a guy who seems like hes all wrong but turns out to be Mr. Right. Heigls Holly an ambitious caterer meets the motorcycle-riding Eric Messer (a buff and scruffy Josh Duhamel) in a blind-date prologue that establishes them as oil as water. She is a compulsive planner he flies by the seat of his id just like Sally and Harry. When their respective best friends die in a car crash they are shocked to learn they have been named as guardians of their year-old daughter Sophie. (Apparently when they agreed to be godparents they didnt bother to look the word up in the dictionary.) What follows is a lot of obligatory diaper humor and an off-and-on attraction that culminates in the ultimate in rom-com cliches a rush to the airport to stop true love from flying off to Phoenix. The setup is unconvincing the chemistry between the leads is tepid and the plot is as predictable as they come. But ""Life as We Know It"" is saved by a genuine affection for the roller-coaster ride of parenting and by a series of amusing bit parts that make the movie a pleasant if forgettable entertainment. Sarah Burns steals scenes as a seemingly prim social worker and Melissa McCarthy (Sookie on ""The Gilmore Girls"") does the same as a pushy neighbor. The supporting cast serves up enough small moments of surprise to keep this formula flick from falling flat. Reach the reporter at kerry.lengelarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4896.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Does America now demand its onscreen sweethearts to be brittle snappish and impeccably tailored and coiffed? Thats the gamble on which Katherine Heigl has staked her career since breaking out from the Greys Anatomy ensemble with Knocked Up. She looks great and smiles winningly but only between long fits of chewing out her male co-stars and anyone else who gets in her way. Heigl doubles down on that bet with Life As We Know It which feels like one long argument between her character and co-star Josh Duhamel interrupted only by the occasional montage featuring a cute baby. To be fair Heigl plays a character under an unusual amount of stress. After her best friend (Christina Hendricks) and her best friends husband (Hayes MacArthur) die in a car accident they leave their 1-year-old daughter in Heigls care with the provision that she raise the child with their other best friend--a slobbish womanizing television sports director played by Duhamel. Do they get along? No they do not. But for the good of the kid they work out a series of compromises that allows them to live under one roof an arrangement theyre apparently committed to sticking with until the child grows to adulthood. The movies fuzzy on that detail. In fact Life As We Know It doesnt spend much time exploring particulars of this arrangement in its long shouty trudge toward Heigl and Duhamels inevitable mated-in-captivity pairing. Mostly director Greg Berlanti--a TV veteran responsible for Everwood Brothers amp; Sisters and other shows--lets the co-stars snap at each other while tending to the baby as if theyd just inherited a being from another world. (It leaks It cries) Too bad all the sniping crowds out some potential entertainment happening in the margins from supporting players like Melissa McCarthy and Andrew Daly as a brassy wife and her henpecked husband and Sarah Burns as Heigl and Duhamels blunt social worker. Instead we get bickering that weighs the film down without giving it any gravity and twinkly cutesiness that doesnt compensate for all the disapproving glares. Pity any poor kid stuck in a house like that. Pity too anyone who has to stop by for a visit.

Comments click to enlarge Life as We Know It Rated PG-13  115 minutes  2010 Since Knocked Up Katherine Heigl has starred in a string of ill-conceived romantic comedies ranging from the drab 27 Dresses to the ghastly Killers. Her latest vehicle tries to milk laughs from tragedy as a successful caterer she finds herself cohabiting with a womanizing director of TV sports programs (Josh Duhamel) while they care for the baby daughter of their mutual friends whove died in a car crash. Credulity is stretched throughout from a ridiculously lenient social worker to the three neighbors--a single woman a married woman and a gay man--who are hot for Duhamel. The movie relies on the notion that postponing sex heightens arousal but its lovers arent any better matched post-coitus than they were before. Greg Berlanti directed; with Christina Hendricks.

"Life as We Know It A romantic comedy that actually doesnt crush your soul - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Life as We Know It A romantic comedy that actually doesnt crush your soulLife as We Know It a 2 1/2 starsOctober 07 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticCompared to ""27 Dresses"" ""The Ugly Truth"" and ""Killers"" -- ""The Ugly Truth"" and ""Killers"" being extra-specially evil benchmarks of how low modern romantic comedies can go -- ""Life as We Know It"" does not crush your soul does not turn Katherine Heigl into a shrill pain in the keister only occasionally devolves into clumsy poorly timed slapstick and outstays its modest but heartfelt welcome only by 10-15 minutes. ""Killers"" had a running time of 93 minutes yet somehow managed to outstay its welcome by 94. I have a sinking feeling that me having had a not-bad time at ""Life as We Know It"" which co-stars the appealing Josh Duhamel means its destined to make less money than any of the above. For a film deeply into formula both of the baby and the screenwriting varieties its just scrappy and off-center enough to alienate a sizable portion of the audience. To which I say Good for you At times like these we must remember what that great great Hollywood mogul Henrik Ibsen said ""The majority is always wrong."" Heigl and Duhamel are playing safely within their grooves to the extent that Heigls character a baker and caterer owns up to being ""a bit of a control freak"" (who doesnt think of Heigl that way?) and Duhamel wears his baseball cap backward signifying carefree lad-about-town and a boy-man resisting the responsibilities of unexpected parenthood. (All that from a cap) Premise After their best friends die in a car accident Holly (Heigl) and Eric (Duhamel) the godparents who can barely tolerate each other learn theyve been named guardians of year-old Sophie. Uneasily they move in to their late friends spacious Atlanta home and begin playing competing versions of ""house."" The movie covers a year in their complicated lives as they inch toward romance (a prologue set in 2007 establishes that they tried one blind date and failed). The telegramming of certain gags certain vomit-and poop-related gags certain baby vomit-and-poop-related gags is enough to bring the telegram back into a second golden age. Whats different here is the mixture of tones. The movie begins with a tragedy and eases into a more interesting blend of drama and comedy than weve gotten in this genre lately. Director Greg Berlantis TV credits (""Brothers amp; Sisters"" ""Dawsons Creek"" ""Everwood"") explain the attractive synthetic materials on display but the script by Ian Deitchman and Kristin Rusk Robinson takes time to establish the leads as fully functioning and reasonably likable adults who are (surprise) nothing like each other. Yet the movie doesnt feel like a put-down of the female protagonist. Its not about taming the shrew. This is a change from what audiences have come to expect from the usual Heigl vehicle. Shes quicker-witted and warmer than usual here and she keeps Duhamel on his toes even when the storyline drags its feet. Yes theres a dash to the airport to confess how much so-and-so loves so-and-so. But even that doesnt play out according to the ancient blueprint dating back to when movie characters ran to train stations more often than tarmacs. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating PG-13 (for sexual material language and some drug content) Cast Katherine Heigl (Holly Berenson); Josh Duhamel (Eric Messer); Josh Lucas (Sam); Christina Hendricks (Alison); Hayes MacArthur (Peter) Credits Directed by Greg Berlanti; written by Ian Deitchman and Kristin Rusk Robinson; produced by Barry Josephson and Paul Brooks. A Warner Bros. Pictures release. Running time 153. Bringing up (someone elses) baby ""Raising Helen"" (2004) Kate Hudson (as Helen) becomes an instant mother of three when her sister and brother-in-law die in a car accident. ""Mostly Martha"" (2001) Remade as ""No Reservations"" in the U.S. this German film stars Martina Gedeck as a chef who takes in her niece when her sister dies in a car accident. ""Baby Boom"" (1987) Diane Keaton plays a Wall Street striver whose life is upended when she inherits a baby girl from a deceased cousin.

Life As We Know It (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Life As We Know It (PG-13) Predictable romantic comedy is business as usual. Katherine Heigl Sophie and Josh Duhamel. (Warner Bros.) Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald10/7/2010 Editor rating 1.5 Sometimes I suspect there is secret high-stakes contest in Hollywood among filmmakers to try and come up with a movie without a single original idea. If so Life As We Know It is a contender (although its going to get stiff competition from The Back-Up Plan which terrorized moviegoers earlier this year). The story line goes something like this A couple sets up her friend Holly (Katherine Heigl) with his friend Messer (Josh Duhamel) on a date that goes disastrously wrong. Hes a slob and a womanizer; shes a prissy control freak. Imagine. Then the couple is killed in a car accident and custody of their year-old daughter Sophie goes to these two unlikely caretakers who dont even like each other The worst tragedy of this set-up is that the dead mom is Christina Hendricks of Mad Men whos infinitely more interesting than Heigl who reprises her shrill I-cant-get-a man persona that is fast becoming unbearable. (Yes 27 Dresses was a lot of girly fun but see The Ugly Truth for more evidence of this claim.) Duhamel acquits himself better here than he did in the excruciating When in Rome but no matter how appealing he looks in his jogging shorts hes still just doing the same old thing. The baby is cute of course but the plot is as formulaic as whats in her bottle. Little Sophie (played by a set of triplets) cries all night and spits up on everyone. Messer worries about commitment issues and keeping his booty-call lifestyle alive. Holly pretends to be disgusted by him and meets a thoughtful well-groomed doctor (Josh Lucas) who in real life would end this hoax of a romance immediately. (What new single mom gives up a pediatrician?) A social worker shows up at inopportune times - say after a batch of brownies laced with marijuana has been baked. There is even that most unholy cliche a race to the airport during which Holly hopes to unburden herself of her true feelings. Not even a bite of those pot brownies could make that scene palatable or make us believe Life As We Know It is anything more than Hollywood business as usual. Cast Katherine Heigl Josh Duhamel Josh Lucas Christina Hendricks. Director Greg Berlanti. Screenwriters Ian Deitchman Kristin Rusk Robinson. Producers Paul Brooks Barry Josephson. A Warner Bros. release. Running time 112 minutes. Sexual material language drug content. Playing at area theaters.

A married couple sends two of their friends bubbly caterer Holly (Katherine Heigl) and playboy TV technician Messer (Josh Duhamel) on a date that goes badly. That should be the end of that yet the fallout of a tragedy requires that the two live under their friends roof and raise their baby. The debate is low. Will they? Wont they? Can he change a nappy? This is yet another spin on the mismatched-couple comedy although luckily theres enough of a spark between Heigl and Duhamel (in contrast say to Gerard Butler and Jennifer Aniston in the disastrous The Bounty Hunter) to distract from the obvious plotting and faceless direction. Duhamels one-note immature jock shtick is hard to warm to but Heigl offers an easy comic naturalism. At best it feels like theres a more serious drama simmering under the surface. At worst we have to endure Heigl and Duhamels excruciating stoned act.

Posted October 8 2010 -- 1200 AM EDT In the business-as-usually-awful romantic comedy Life as We Know It Katherine Heigl plays Holly a dithering control freak of a single career girl (youre shocked right?) unprepared to take care of an infant unexpectedly left in her care. We know this because Holly shrieks at the smell of a dirty diaper collapses under the challenge of removing said undergarment by pulling two pieces of tape and greets neighbors unaware of the insouciant streak of baby poo on her face. Theres something about Holly Shes the most ridiculous irritating two-dimensional rom-com heroine since...Katherine Heigls last rom-com. Fulfilling I can only assume Hollywood career-building homework assigned by his agent Josh Duhamel (Transformers) plays last-name-only Messer the caveman hero so wrong for Holly that hes bound to end up sweetly wiping the poo from her cheek. For his part Messer demonstrates his unsuitability for parenthood by dropping the baby out of her carrier and parking her with a taxi driver when he cant find a sitter. Holly and Messer have rom-com love-hated each other ever since a rom-com bad blind date years ago. But theyre raising this kid together because of a wee bit of plot-pushing tragedy The parents who are allegedly Holly and Messers best friends die (neatly and casually) in a car accident. (Pity. Mom is played by Mad Mens Christina Hendricks.) Have there ever in the history of reality existed parents who fail to discuss the responsibilities of legal guardianship with those designated as legal guardians? Well there are in the tedious unreality of this witless unfunny unromantic product a comedy as disposable -- and stinky -- as loaded Pampers.

Trust me she doesnt) and separate in a huff before making it to dinner. Soon the best friends die leaving custody of a baby daughter to the ""incompatible"" twosome. Guess how long it takes the barely mourning singles to fall in love? If sitcom parenthood begins with a romantic kiss and resolves itself in a lifetime of compromise and adjusted expectations Life As We Know It imagines motherhood in reverse. Largely shooting through a hazy white dreamlike filter director Greg Berlanti creates some womans dream instant satisfaction of domestic and matrimonial urges via the takeover of a perfect friends perfect life--with the added bonuses of transforming an Entourage-style dude into a domesticated dad and indulging in desserts while still fitting into a pencil skirt. And all without having to put up with stretch marks without putting the career on hold without having to do much at all but change an occasional diaper. Perfect wish fulfillment--right? If only. Life offers some vicarious pleasure for the baby-hungry but it also forces Heigl--and most of the other women in the picture--to humiliate themselves for the sake of gags that debase without drawing laughs (unless errant poop is your idea of a comic riot . . . ?) while Duhamels himbo struts obliviously. The feminine fantasies Berlanti seemingly seeks to stoke are undercut by a vibe thats weirdly misogynistic.

Daily Edition Login to download Life as We Know It -- Film Review 137 PM PDT 10/14/2010 by Kirk Honeycutt FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS An innocuous sitcom about two combative people trying to raise a child. TWITTER ""Life as We Know It"" could be a backdoor pilot for a TV sitcom about a man and woman struggling to raise a toddler who is not their own. Although wholly predictable in its every beat and featuring bland unremarkable WASPs as romantic leads ""Life"" is not without its charms. Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel do make for very attractive leads while bringing plenty of vitality to thinly written roles. And the various twins who play the crucial third character first as an infant and then a supercute 2-year-old girl are coaxed into winning performances. So Warner Bros. once the studio that flew the flag for macho-man movies probably will see fair-to-middling coin opening weekend thanks to female viewers. But the film probably lacks staying power; its natural home is in home entertainment. Like any good sitcom the movie manages the neat trick of never having to change locations despite a substantial upheaval in the lives of three people each with a separate home when the story begins. A screenplay by Ian Deitchman and Kristin Rusk Robinson imagines that a married couple who die in a car accident can somehow will their child home and even mortgage payments to the childs two godparents who are not married and indeed can barely stand each other. So the movie runs through all the challenges of raising Sophie -- all that fine comedy involving diapers sleep deprivation crying fits and finicky eating -- with ""parents"" who only get to fall in love after reluctantly adopting a baby. No thats not a spoiler; theres nowhere else for this movie to go. The movie begins three years earlier with a blind date between Heigls Holly and Duhamels Messer which probably wasnt necessary and certainly is a poor setup for the male character. Messer -- everyone calls him by his last name -- eventually gets established as a cad who rarely calls a girl after getting her in bed. But because this is a first date with an exceptionally good-looking woman why does he act like such a jerk? As with many movies with foregone conclusions for endings and not much story in between ""Life"" drowns in montage sequences. There are montages to demonstrate the arch of the couples mutual animosity to show Sophie learning to walk and to show the couple redecorating the house to make it their own. Director Greg Berlanti whose background is of course in television keeps things on an even keel without many spikes of either comedy or drama. Peripheral characters dont have much to do. A handsome pediatrician (John Lucas) is around to play a rival to Messer for Hollys affections and a social worker (Sarah Burns) drops by as a threat to the couples continued custody of Sophie. Tech credits are pro if unexceptional.

Katherine Heigl has already done enough similar movies to warrant grading on a curve (a ""Knocked Up"" here a ""27 Dresses"" there) so the mild revelation will be Josh Duhamel though not to anyone who admired his romantic-comedy credentials from ""Win a Date With Tad Hamilton."" Its a predictable date-night diversion true but the stork will still likely deliver Warner Bros. reasonably happy returns. Theres no escaping the sitcom premise -- mismatched couple who hate each other reluctantly forced to raise orphaned baby -- but ""Life as We Know It"" milks its formula (pardon the expression) for about all it can. Katherine Heigl has already done enough similar movies to warrant grading on a curve (a ""Knocked Up"" here a ""27 Dresses"" there) so the mild revelation will be Josh Duhamel though not to anyone who admired his romantic-comedy credentials from ""Win a Date With Tad Hamilton."" Its a predictable date-night diversion true but the stork will still likely deliver Warner Bros. reasonably happy returns. Granted the ""Omigod The diapers full"" gags are hardly new (Foxs sitcom ""Raising Hope"" is currently mining the same soiled linen) and romantic comedies tend to be dangerous zones these days for biological parents. But for young women in particular a lot of this will resonate -- including the fact that whenever Duhamels character strips down to jog that prospect brings out much of the neighborhood to bathe him in admiring stares. Duhamels Eric (who goes by his last name Messer) is a guys guy so much so that he arrives on a pre-credits blind date with Heigls Holly with a latenight booty call already lined up. Yes the first meetings a disaster but the two are best friends with the respective halves of a young couple (Hayes MacArthur ""Mad Mens"" Christina Hendricks) so they tolerate each other while keeping up with them and their baby daughter Sophie (played by a trio of tots). An accident later Holly and Messer discover their friends have left them as the childs guardians forcing them to take up residence together in the couples house. The improbability of it all notwithstanding (nobody told them?) this leads to the requisite new-parent confusion coupled with sexual tension disguised as hostility -- hes a man-child/horndog naturally and shes an uptight list-maker. Director Greg Berlanti is best known for his work in television (""Brothers amp; Sisters"" ""Everwood"") and stars Heigl (""Greys Anatomy"") and Duhamel (""Las Vegas"") came to prominence in that medium as well. The filmmakers have also assembled a gifted ensemble of actors primarily associated with TV with Melissa McCarthy of CBS ""Mike amp; Molly"" standing out as a round-faced Georgia peach (the settings Atlanta) who gets the vapors around Messer -- who when not bedding women works behind the scenes on Hawks basketball telecasts. The script by Ian Deitchman and Kristin Rusk Robinson hardly breaks any new ground but it does yield occasional bursts of dialogue that exceed expectations. That said Berlanti overstays his welcome padding out the movies length (how many musical montages do you really need?) in a manner that demands some patience given that the ultimate destination -- despite a handsome pediatrician (Josh Lucas) vying for Hollys affection -- never seems in doubt. Mostly though Berlanti seems to recognize that between the cute baby and Duhamels even cuter smile ""Life"" delivers enough ""aww"" moments (coupled with the occasional laugh) to deliver its moneys worth to an audience vulnerable to such elements -- perhaps especially those who have pried open a diaper with trepidation.All that might sound painfully familiar or like a welcome distraction but either way ""Life"" demonstrates quite a lot about the state of this genre as we know it -- and by that unexacting measure anyway its better than most.
