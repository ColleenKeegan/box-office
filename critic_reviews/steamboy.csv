Here the steamball developed by pioneering English inventor Eddie Steam (voiced by Alfred Molina in this solid English dub) offers a potentially fearsome source of energy but with its creator in the pay of powerful American arms manufacturers concerned grandpa Steam (Patrick Stewart) smuggles the gizmo back to his grandson Ray (Anna Paquin). The final power struggle however takes place in London where Eddies employers are planning a show of strength - at the Great Exhibition in the Crystal Palace.With every piston and pane of glass painstakingly registered Otomos film thrums with admiration for nineteenth-century Britain while creating a whole array of steam-powered weaponry and flying machines echoing the inventions of Hayao Miyazaki. Sadly though one-note thematic repetition and scrappy over-extended action sequences fail to translate the evident pictorial qualities into a satisfying storyline. An exasperatingly uneven affair.

"Steamboy So Cool Its Cold washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Steamboy So Cool Its Cold Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday March 25 2005 I passed a tourist the other day shooting camcorder footage . . . of a building. Now after watching ""Steamboy"" Japanimation icon Katsuhiro (""Akira"") Otomos visually resplendent sci-fi adventure set in Victorian England and Korean director Moon Sang Kims recent futuristic ""Sky Blue"" Ive figured out what that footage gets used for. It gets sent to the Far East where teams of animators turn it into gorgeously detailed backgrounds for narratively dull feature-length cartoons. If only they would lavish as much attention and money on the human characters as they do on the sets maybe theyd have something. (Oh wait they already tried that. It was called ""Final Fantasy The Spirits Within."") Touted as the most expensive Japanese animated film ever made ""Steamboy"" is right to brag about the lushness of its reimagined late-19th-century world a metal-spined and wood-ribbed world in which the power of steam has been harnessed like nuclear energy by a father-and-son team of inventors (voices of Patrick Stewart and Alfred Molina). After an accident in which the younger man is disfigured a dispute arises between them over the potentially destructive use of this awesome power. Enter the heroic grandson the aptly named Ray Steam (voiced with as much boyish enthusiasm as she can muster by Anna Paquin) who is entrusted with keeping the volatile energy source contained in a melon-size metal orb called a ""steamball"" out of the hands of those who would use its power to make weapons. Its all very loud and metaphorical with the kind of generically grand cheesy music that only keeps you from falling asleep when you most need to. Its problem is not a lack of things to look at. Theres plenty of them and theyre all cool. Its just that in this world of clanking hissing machines even the people seem like robots. STEAMBOY (PG-13 106 minutes) -- Contains cartoon violence. At Landmarks E Street Cinema. The last showing of every day will be the original uncut Japanese-language version of the film with subtitles running 120 minutes.

Its a globalized version of the longer denser domestic-Japanese version and one has to wonder was this scrub job really necessary? We already have a Disney and a DreamWorks animation department as well as a Twentieth Century Fox unit. We dont need more of them boutique divisions of huge industrial congloms owned by mega-corporations that squirt out blandly streamlined works meant to appeal to the restaurateurs of Angola as well as the pawnbrokers of Bangkok and the DVD collectors of Lapland. Young inventor Ray Steam tries to save London in a too-mechanical version of the Japanese anime film.

Pictorially it has combined the mystical with the streamlined and the delicate with the violent. Sometimes it even seemed to make a little sense Such films as Otomos own ""Akira""; ""Ghost in the Shell"" and its sequel; and the epic ""Samurai X"" have singularity and precision. To see them is to accept them into the cranial vault forever. By these lights ""Steamboy"" is a disappointment albeit a spectacular one. This version of it -- for anime connoisseurs the Japanese version will be shown at the E Street Cinema at the last screening daily -- has been internationalized into something thats both gigantic and bland. It lacks what might be called a soul Theres no sense of the intensity of Japanese culture behind it. The imagery is all hard-edged and unambiguous. The characters are cliches the violence generic and endless and somehow the whole thing adds up too easily. It doesnt have that exquisite Japanese insistence on not revealing itself too clearly. The movie is set -- I am not making this up -- in London at the time of the Great Exhibition which might be viewed as the consecration party of the Industrial Age. It marked the formal ascension of the machine over the heart and it ultimately spelled the end of everything decent and noble that Western Civilization had ever produced (okay we got the toaster out of it) as well as leading inexorably to the weapons of mass destruction the Japanese became intimately familiar with in 1945. ""Steamboy"" clearly means to be a critique of Western culture It uses issues such as industrialism domination mass destruction ambition and despotism as a background to what feels like a boys book adventure. Yet somehow it lacks conviction These concepts are viewed from the outside in and they never come alive to give the movie that special sense of confidence. Let the Japanese contemplate the mysteries of Bushido the game of Go the art of the tea ceremony the porcelain neck of a geisha. I will follow those investigations anywhere. Here the filmmaker is tone-deaf He cant recognize the difference between a true vision of Western hubris and something that feels arbitrary cliched entirely predictable. Generically the movie turns out to be one of those science-fiction pieces that is drawn from a peculiar moment in science so the fiction has a historical sense to it. ""Robots"" of two weeks ago did a similar trick essentially basing its Rube Goldberg version of reality on the engineering of 1938 or so. In ""Steamboy"" the key year is 1851 and the defining miracle of the age is the steam engine abetted by the secret device that makes heavy machinery possible the rivet. The movie is therefore machine crazed. It is full of gigantic steam-driven engines of destruction -- the dreadnought is a key image although historically dreadnoughts did not come to rule the oceans until the early 1900s -- each with an assortment of grinding gears and hissing pistons. If it moves by land add clanking tires with valves levers servo-mechanisms tubes and grease holes; if by sea towering superstructures belching stacks and whirling propellers. In fact under the bland story the true drama of the thing is whether or not director Otomo can trump himself as he keeps unveiling bigger and more unlikely devices to fill the screen. The conceit of ""Steamboy"" is that in this smoky belching loud universe aborning some kind of mysterious weapons-manufacturing conglomerate called the OHara Foundation means to control steam and therefore the world. The stage for the takeover is the Great Exhibition at the Crystal Palace that glass castle on the greensward at Hyde Park where the worlds industrialized nations gathered to show off their new goodies in the name of progress and nationalism. (Col. Colt had a wondrous exhibition of his ultramodern ""revolving"" handguns.) As Otomo tells it a family actually called ""Steam"" -- three generations of em in fact a Grandpa Steam his visionary but corrupted son and his heroic grandson Ray -- all share genius-level engineering brains. The grandfather has uncovered some form of concentrated steam -- the physics are baffling -- and contained it in what he calls a ""steam ball"" a font of endless power in the form of an object that looks like a bowling ball with a garden hose nozzle attached. Plotwise ""Steamboy"" is pretty simple bowling ball bowling ball whos got that darned bowling ball? The bowling ball changes hands several times after its initial delivery to Ray Steams house. Secret agents from the OHara Foundation -- their leader turns out to be Rays dark father possibly a Darth Vader allusion -- seek it with a variety of road graders bulldozers and threshing machines and a wild card in the chase is the grandfather a whiskery old goat who carries on like some kind of Old Testament prophet and keeps showing up at the most opportune moments. Then there are some boys from the British secret service or some such originally seen as heroic but ultimately revealed as mere competitors in the game of power. Finally and most unfortunately a pushy little girl named -- again I am not making this up -- Scarlett OHara is yet another wild card in the confusion and shes by no means an attractive or calming influence. In fact shes extremely annoying. Those are the players; the game is played in increasingly gigantic action set pieces against the coming opening of the Great Exhibition climaxing in nothing less than a pitched battle in downtown London between the OHara forces (steam-powered robotic combat suits flying machines Gatling guns mini-subs) and the British armed forces (rifles steam-driven motor torpedo boats dreadnoughts) that leaves everything in ruins and presumably millions dead. A strange building called ""the Steam Castle"" revealed to be a craft as big as the mothership in ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" ultimately has a close encounter of the first kind with the most civilized city in the world. Bye-bye Bloomsbury. So long to Piccadilly Circus. London Bridge you are falling down. Yet all this destruction is queerly unrooted in emotion. The movie never transcended its elaborate production work to achieve an independent reality. Its simply pictures of what never happened. Steamboy (105 minutes at Landmarks E Street Cinema) is rated PG-13 for intense but not gory violence.

The film takes place in a Jules Verne fantasy of Victorian London a formal gray kingdom of bowler hats muttonchop sideburns and magic industrial inventions. I cant imagine what it would sound like in Japanese. Porn cyberpunk down-the-rabbit-hole reverie Its hard to think of a corridor of outlandish imagination through which anime hasnt passed. Steamboy by contrast is a work of stodgy retro classicism. The hero voiced by Anna Paquin (well why not?) discovers that his father a scarred megalomaniac has built the Steam Castle -- a gigantic fortress of pipes levers and pressure gauges that rises over London like a wrought-iron factory version of the mothership in Close Encounters. Its nifty to behold but about the only drama in Steamboy lies in waiting for this colossal hovering machine-monster to blow a gasket.

Allen Johnson Published 400 am Friday March 18 2005 Lost Embrace Comedy-drama. Directed by Daniel Burman. (Not rated. 99 mins. In Spanish with English subtitles. At the Balboa.). The hero of ""Lost Embrace"" wants nothing more than to bolt the scruffy Buenos Aires shopping mall where he helps his mother run a lingerie shop that may be doing a bit better than most of the other marginal businesses there but doesnt exactly promise a bright future. In his 30s and restless Ariel Makaroff ( Daniel Hendler ) is angling to move to Poland a land of opportunity in his view -- its also the place his Jewish grandmother fled during World War II. But that old dame (Rosita Londner) is reluctant to provide the documents he needs to get a European passport. Ariel also has issues with his father who left the family behind to fight for Israel in the Yom Kippur War (1973) and never came back. Its unlikely material for a comedy but comedy is what Argentine director Daniel Burman makes of it. The mall is a world of its own where everyone knows everyone elses business (or thinks they do). We see Ariel interacting with among others the Saliganis the Italian family that runs a radio repair shop and beauty parlor; with the Kims Korean newlyweds who sell feng shui items; with Rita (Silvina Bosco) the sex goddess who works in the Internet shop and has an ambiguous relationship with an older man there; and with Ariels brother Joseph (Sergio Boris) who wanted to be a rabbi and now runs a somewhat shady import-export business. Meanwhile Ariels mother (Adriana Aizenberg) has kept the family business going but seems to spend much of her time making and eating lekach (honey cake). The lekach which everyone seems to be munching is a running gag one of the malls idiosyncrasies that Burman delights in showing (among them is a competition between deliverymen pushing dollies -- the malls equivalent of a day at the races). For Ariel life at the mall feels stultifying and he isnt alone. Theres a general sense of a community in decline and even the aging local rabbi announces that hes leaving to take over a synagogue in Florida. Ariel is set to cut the cord. But while his mother and grandmother seem content to forget the past he finds he cant simply walk away from it and specifically from his resentment at the father (Jorge DElia) who abandoned him. Once in a while Burman seems on the verge of letting things slide into shtick but finally the film is a gentle comedy that tackles some serious issues resolving them in a way that may be less than profound but carries emotional heft. Burmans use of handheld camera and his editing convey the messiness of life in the malls large extended family but he never allows the hurly-burly of the setting to overwhelm Ariels story. ""Lost Embrace"" won a grand jury prize and Handler received the best actor award at last years Berlin International Film Festival. The movie was Argentinas selection for the 2004 best foreign film Oscar. -- Advisory The film has no MPAA rating but contains mature themes. -- Walter Addiego Eating Out Comedy-drama. Starring Scott Lunsford and Jim Verraros. Written and directed by Q. Allan Brocka. (Not rated. 85 minutes. At the Castro.). One thing you can say in favor of ""Eating Out"" Its the best movie yet to star an ""American Idol"" survivor. This tri-sexual farce which won the best first feature award at last years San Francisco International Lesbian amp; Gay Film Festival co-stars Jim Verraros famously the first finalist voted off in the first season of ""Idol."" Verraros plays Kyle who convinces his roommate Caleb (hottie Scott Lunsford the most natural actor in the cast) to pretend to be gay to attract Gwen (a shrill Emily Stiles) whose favorite bedroom sport is trying to ""switch"" gay guys. But Gwen decides Caleb would be a great catch for her gay roommate Marc (Ryan Carnes the new gay gardener on ""Desperate Housewives"") ... who is naturally the object of Kyles affection. Sort of a love parallelogram if you will. Director Q. Allan Brocka loads up the screen with eye-candy for every preference -- no one keeps a shirt on for long. Think Skinemax with a gay twist. But his script overdoses on pop culture references and bitchy wisecracks that his trying-too-hard cast cant quite pull off. -- Advisory The film has no MPAA rating but contains mature language and sexual themes. -- Joe Brown Steamboy Japanese anime. Written and directed by Katsuhiro Otomo. Dubbed in English (except at Lumiere which is in Japanese w/English subtitles). 104 minutes. Rated PG-13. (At Bay Area theaters).. If he made no other film Katsuhiro Otomo would go down in movie history as making one of the best and most influential anime films ""Akira"" (1988). It seemed for a while as if Otomo never would make another film - he worked mostly in television and writing screenplays (2001s ""Metropolis"") for 16 years until coming up with his second animated feature ""Steamboy."" And what unusual anime it is. The first oddity is its setting -- not many Japanese anime films are set in Victorian England which means that for Westerners the English dubbing (featuring the voices of Patrick Stewart Anna Paquin and Alfred Molina) actually helps. (Note ""Steamboy"" plays in the original 126-minute Japanese-language version with English subtitles at the Lumiere). The ambitious movie unspools with the complicated precision of a Rube Goldberg device. Ray Steam is a cheeky young lad who receives a strange metal ball which is dubbed a ""steamball"" from his grandfather who must go into hiding. It contains a power that can preserve or destroy the human race and he must protect it from an evil villain who has built an elaborate machine that will dominate London. The real pleasure of this movie which has many is the last 40 minutes when the villains plan is unleashed and young Ray must save London. It is the most ambitious stretch of any animated film I have ever seen action-packed and tightly edited with imaginative conceptions based on the mechanical contraptions of the period. ""Steamboy"" is a fine example of how anime uniquely contributes to world cinema. -- Advisory This film is rated PG-13 for animated violence. -- G.

Leading manga and Japanimation writer-helmer Katsuhiro Otomo charcoal-filters his ambivalent attitude toward technology through a complex sci-fi plot set in Victorian England where steam power has quasi-nuke destructive potential. Pic is being touted as most expensive anime movie ever and budget shows in every intricate painstakingly designed frame. The diaspora of anime buffs who revere helmer will ensure healthy opening figures as a niche release. However dry storytelling and boys-toys mechanics will stop this from being the next ""Spirited Away""-style crossover hit. In Manchester in 1866 young factory-assistant Ray is the son of Eddie Steam a scientist abroad working with his father Lloyd Steam. Grandpa Lloyd sends Ray a mysterious ball in the mail that nefarious agents from the shadowy OHara Foundation try to seize. Ray escapes on a one-wheel contraption of his own devising (first of pics many groovy gizmos) but is captured and whisked by zeppelin to the OHara Foundations pavilion at the not-yet-opened Great Exhibition in London. Eventually it is revealed that the strange ball is a type of engine using compressed steam of ""unbelievable power"" invented by Lloyd. Several of these balls run the OHara pavilion which later reveals itself to be an immense mobile fortress. Deep inside its bowels Ray discovers both his dad Eddie who has fallen under the sway of OHara and Grandpa Lloyd who fearing OHara wishes to harness the steam balls power for evil ends is trying to foil their plans. Gramps suspicions look to be on the money when the OHara faction hijacks the opening of the Great Exhibition to turn it into an armament show for potential buyers from nations around the world. Otomo also works in a chaste love interest for Ray in the form of a spoiled little rich girl named of all things Scarlett OHara but her role seems a merely cursory concession to young femme auds. Pics implicit ideology is consistent with the helmers pacifist and techno-skeptic principles as displayed in his feature ""Akira"" short ""Cannon Fodder"" (in portmanteau pic ""Memories"") and the story he penned for Hiroyuki Kitakubos ""Rojin Z."" But Otomo is a Socratic instructor leaving the aud to make its own mind up like Ray torn between his dad and his granddads equally persuasive arguments. Younger viewers may start squirming with boredom during the heavier debates but theres always another cool piston-powered machine on the way. As a writer Otomo may fear how technology is used by those in power but as an artist he sure loves a good gadget. Animation is aces further pushing the possibilities of blending computer-generated 3-D technology with traditional 2-D design. Palette takes its cue from sepia tones of old photographs washing out the colors and recreating the drab milky light of British weather very effectively. Character design is a bit conventional compared with the lavish backgrounds. SteamboyJapan ProductionA Toho Co.
