"No special effects needed for The Flight Fantastics stunning trapeze performance footage - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review No special effects needed for The Flight Fantastics stunning trapeze performance footage The Flight Fantastic Damiki Productions A still from the movie ""The Flight Fantastic"" featuring Richie Gaona left and his brother Armando. A still from the movie ""The Flight Fantastic"" featuring Richie Gaona left and his brother Armando. (Damiki Productions) Kenneth Turan Made without computer-generated imagery or elaborate special effects ""The Flight Fantastic"" will nevertheless have you doubting your eyes as you watch its action unfold.Subtitled ""A Story of Legend and Legacy on the Flying Trapeze"" this documentary tells the story of the Flying Gaonas routinely described as ""the first family of the air"" during their years of circus stardom for Ringling Bros. and Barnum amp; Bailey. Footage of this sibling quartet and other memorable performers as they yes fly through the air with the greatest of ease never fails to elevate and enthrall. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story As directed by Tom Moore ""The Flight Fantastic"" is not executed as crisply as the routines it features. A trapeze enthusiast himself Moore is not shy about displaying his passion. His shambling amiable film has a tendency to wander and digress sometimes effectively sometimes not. But its core of balletic trapeze footage is always gripping.The Flying Gaonas are the fourth generation of a Mexican circus family. Their father Victor sometimes known as the Chaplin of the trapeze for his comic act started his children on the trampoline and they and their father soon formed an act known as the Four Titos. But being on the trapeze was always on the siblings minds with son Tito appearing on TVs ""Whats My Line?"" as a boy aerialist at age 10. This passion did nothing but intensify after seeing Burt Lancaster Tony Curtis and Gina Lollobrigida in the sturdy circus drama ""Trapeze.""The Gaonas as their performance footage amply testifies all had big personalities. Armando the gifted oldest son ended up as the catcher after his father retired and Chela the only woman in the act was a complete ball of fire tiny but powerful. Richie a decade younger than his siblings had beautiful form and joined the act fulltime when dad Victor retired. And then there was Tito.A splendid flier called by Sports Illustrated ""maybe the finest athlete in the world"" Tito stood out even in his ultra-charismatic family. Someone who specialized in unprecedented routines like ""the double-double"" (a double somersault with a double twist) some of which he literally dreamed up. Tito even intentionally made mistakes because ""if you make it perfect no one will know how hard it was.""""The Flight Fantastic"" is at its best relating the multiple international triumphs of the Flying Gaonas including winning the Golden Clown the circus Oscar at Monte Carlos international circus festival. Also interesting is the history of the trapeze form related by a series of circus journalists and historians and including the accomplishments of Frenchman Jules Leotard who came up with the garment that bears his name.Most emotional of all is the tragic story of Alfredo Cardona the great aerialist of the 1920s the first man to make a triple somersault a regular part of his act and doomed fellow aerialist Lillian Leitzel ""the Queen of the Air.""Tito always felt a strong connection with Cardona even before accidentally coming upon his elaborate grave in Inglewood Park Cemetery and he became the first man since Cardona to consistently do a triple even occasionally making the move blindfolded.This trapeze lore extending to Titos quest for the elusive quadruple somersault is always of interest but the same cannot be said for the films extended sequences showing us what the Gaonas are doing today much of which involves teaching and passing on their knowledge to the next generations. This stuff is sweet and good-natured but it seems to come from another film entirely.Fortunately we always have footage of the Gaonas in their prime to fall back on. Paul Binder the founder of the Big Apple Circus where the Gaonas performed after they left Ringling Bros. is especially articulate about their act.""They do it with grace and beauty which translates to audiences as a sense of magnificence"" Binder says. ""They were magicians they were there to create magic."" And so they did.No MPAA ratingRunning time 1 hour 37 minutesPlaying Laemmle Music Hall Beverly Hills.""The Flight Fantastic."" Great performance footage enlivens this documentary on the history of the flying trapeze in general and the legendary Flying Gaonas in particular. -- Kenneth Turan Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Tony Curtis Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined TV viewership for Hillary Clintons acceptance speech is smaller than Donald Trumps Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad71deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-flight-fantastic-review-20160613-snap-story.html#nt=oft13a-4gp1,200,flight0,flight,latimes

Credit Big Apple Circus Archive If someone were to call and ask ""Wanna come over and watch our home movies?"" youd probably think ""Ugh."" But thats because you dont know the Gaona family.The Gaonas -- or to use their stage name the Flying Gaonas -- are trapeze performers who in their heyday the 1960s through the 1980s appeared all over the world and brought a new verve to the art form. In ""The Flight Fantastic"" a documentary by Tom Moore they are genial guides to their own history reaching all the way back to their childhood in Mexico in the 1950s when a backyard trampoline first got the siblings Armando Tito Richie and Chela airborne.By the 1960s the family act was touring and the trapeze had joined the trampoline. Tito who is now in his late 60s became the magnetic center a showman in the classic circus tradition.The film propelled by archival footage and vivid recollections from the Gaonas and their admirers moves engagingly from the early days to the spotlight years. Tito Gaonas quest to become the first aerialist to execute a quadruple somersault in performance makes an especially compelling segment. And the familys work in more recent years to pass along the art form is a nice coda. Is the film a bit self-promotional? Sure but its enjoyable nonetheless.

The Flight Fantastic is both a lively biography of the Mexican circus family and a primer on trapeze as both art form and joyous expression. During interviews members of the Gaona family exude relentless good cheer which seems as integral to their success as fearless disciplined physicality. (Moore never mentions injuries or regrets.) Film Details The Flight Fantastic RatingNR GenreAction/Adventure Running Time97 min. More Info No one blended skill and magnetism more than Tito star flier and master showman who was inspired by the Tony Curtis character in Trapeze to incorporate a triple somersault into his performances with brother Armando sister Chela and father Victor. (Curtiss stunt double Fay Alexander was one of Titos first catchers.) The athleticism and charisma of the Gaonas made them international stars during the 1960s and 70s when circus acts were featured on television variety shows and Ringling Bros. and Barnum amp; Bailey drew thousands to their extravagant three-ring big tops. They joined the more intimate Big Apple Circus in the 1980s after younger brother Richie had taken over the most demanding routines. EXPAND While detailing the Flying Gaonas fame and influence Moore emphasizes that theyre part of a continuum trapeze performers who perfect their soaring artistry then teach earthbound enthusiasts how they too can take flight.The Flight Fantastic Directed by Tom Moore Tom Moore Productions Opens April 1 Cinema Village Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Serena Donadoni Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film and TV Film Reviews Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.
