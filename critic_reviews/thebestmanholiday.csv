"Life Death Laughter Epic Romantic Comedy in The Best Man Holiday and About Time << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Life Death Laughter Epic Romantic Comedy in The Best Man Holiday and About Time Courtesy of Universal Pictures Movies November 15 2013 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print The Best Man Holiday directed by Malcolm D. Lee What kind of title is The Best Man Holiday? This isnt a question Im asking. Its been asked of me. Some of the askers are looking for a hyphen or a comma or a colon. They arent grammar police. Theyre just confused. If you dont know this movie is a follow-up to The Best Man a nine-way romantic comedy that was a minor hit 14 years ago its confusing. All the punctuation money was spent plastering Americas bus stops subway stations and billboards with posters of the cast looking sexy with red scarves. Ive seen people stand around trying to figure out whats happening in these ads. Some of these people had already seen the first movie. Back in 1999 four college friends got together for one guys wedding. They brought women. And sparks flew. Harper (Taye Diggs) had written a gossipy roman a clef about his friends sex lives and the weekend revolved around who in the group has read it. It was a good screwball premise that had funk and wit. But it was Malcolm D. Lees first movie as a writer-director and you could tell. He seemed nervous about what it meant for a movie to showcase four black men sitting around talking about sex. The women were combustible borderline stereotypes. But it basically worked. You liked these people because they seemed like real middle-class human beings -- even Candace the stripper Regina Hall played and Shelby the snobby gorgon who should have made Melissa De Sousa more famous. A decade and a half later you can sense that Lee had been thinking about what more he could do with these characters. Theyre in their early forties and now very successful. Getting them back together to compare notes and rehash the past works because there are both thematic opportunities and actual cultural points to make. Harper just lost his job at NYU and needs a new best seller. His agent recommends a book on his estranged superstar football player and best friend Lance (Morris Chestnut). Hes too proud to ask outright. So when Lances wife Mia (Monica Calhoun) summons the gang to their house for Christmas he just starts asking leading questions and sneaking answers into his notebook. Lee packs about a dozen movies into two hours. Harper brings his wife Robyn (Sanaa Lathan) whos got a chip on her shoulder about being very pregnant while surrounded by one of Harpers flings -- Mia -- and his closest lady friend Jordan (Nia Long) a cable executive who might be too careerist to fully commit to her white well-heeled new man (Eddie Cibrian). Theres a dirty video from Candaces past that makes its way around the house until it gets to Shelby who cant stand that Candaces professorial husband Julian (Harold Perrineau) didnt marry her instead. But Shelby might be unmarriageable. Shes still a trifling egomaniac now with a Beyonceeload of blonde extensions. Now an entire wing of the entertainment industry is devoted to the Shelbys of the world. The movie makes her a very rich very famous Real Housewife. Terrence Howard was the best thing about the first film -- all the sexiness and danger came from him. Hes back as Quentin Shelbys slutty male counterpart. The movies too good for him to outright steal but he adds the right amount of nasty seasoning. He and De Sousa are what old Hollywood screwballs would use as the irreverent undercard the pair that has all the deviousness and all the sex thats too sordid for the leads. When they get together its either Noel Coward or Mortal Kombat. When Tyler Perry moved into his haute-bourgie phase with the Why Did I Get Married movies it was fair to accuse him of wanting to replicate the smoothness of The Best Man. But that comfort never came naturally to him. Success in a Perry movie is to be suffered for and suffered from. God in his movies is slightly vengeful. Lee on the other hand is Spikes nephew. A black middle- or upper-middle class isnt a moral test for him. Its a matter of fact. These are characters who want more success. Theres no self-torture in that ambition. And God is on their side. Best Man Holiday is as much a mega-drama as one of Perrys productions. Someone is deathly ill. A child is born in an SUV. Theres an expletive-laced screaming brawl between two women that is the rawest fight Ive seen outside of a schoolyard or a UFC cage. The men dress in sequins and perform a New Edition gem. Its probably too much the throwaway lines the priceless reaction shots the weeping. You leave emotionally exhausted but theres a lot of care in this movie. Lee knows how funny it is to see Howard in a Santa Claus suit so he keeps him in one for about three scenes. He lets Diggs win more laughs with uptight guilty ""ha ha ha ha"" than even George Clooney would get. Its understandable why Lee wanted to come back to this movie. It has come to stand as a breakthrough. His first installment arrived after black moviemakings independent phase in the early 1990s and in middle of the ghetto-comedy period. (Now most of the cast are successes although Long Lathan and Hall can never be successful enough for me.) A movie like this represents a viable way up from slaves and servants. Originally Lee was trying suggest a male answer to Terry McMillans sister-to-sister fantasies. He wanted to live in the real world and in Hollywood. He didnt want to be self-conscious or pretentious about it either. When Candace sees how big Robyn has gotten shes blunt ""Your titties are huge"" Perrys movies have a lot of church. But its a line like that makes you say ""Amen."" About Time directed by Richard Curtis Theres a face some people make when they drink something warm if that something happens to be served in a giant mug and the mug contains whipped cream or foam and the foam winds up on their face. Its part ""aaah"" part ""mmmm"" part ""awww."" Its part ""No one has ever enjoyed a mug of coffee or cocoa as much I am right now."" The satisfaction of drinking this way outweighs the ridiculousness and potential embarrassment of how the drinking makes them look. This to them is heaven and the foam is a blessed blemish of bliss. This is the face people make at Richard Curtis movies. I know because Ive turned around to look. Curtis wrote Four Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill and adapted both Bridget Jones movies. The first movie he directed Love Actually is The Towering Inferno of romantic comedy more than a dozen stars trying to put out a fire. But with Curtis the fire usually burns in the chest. He concocts movies of intense charm and wit then drenches them in cute sentimentality often by making it rain or having someone die. Globally Love Actually grossed close to a quarter-billion dollars. Its mentioned without mockery in a DirecTV ad that plays during football games. I know someone who has seen it 20 times and that someone is neither a woman nor her gay best friend. Dudes makes foam face too Curtis is back climbing the North American box office with About Time another rain-soaked candlelit table for 12 complete with a death toll. Hes added the wrinkle of science fiction -- his protagonist a skinny young redheaded lawyer named Tim Lake (Domhnall Gleeson) can time-travel. Its a gift put to mundane personal private (and pedestrian) use -- at parties and art shows once to save a sibling (Lydia Wilson) from herself. But its an imperfect gift. One night he meets Mary his dream woman a bookish North American played at the height of adult purity by Rachel McAdams. But when he time-shifts to another portion of the evening to save the play of his bitter bitch of a friend (Tom Hollander) it means never meeting Mary and having to win her again. This movie combines Curtiss love of science fiction with his loves of slapstick (hes written for Dr. Who and Rowan Atkinson) and actual love. The combination isnt lethal. Its Groundhog Day without the certitude. What makes Curtis insufferable is that he doesnt know when to dam off his cleverness. His movies always turn into the bookshelf that falls on poor Leonard Bast in Howards End. (Curtis is the furniture guy who ignores the wall supports. Its always safety last with him.) With no shame this movie merges the time-travel and death in order to wring tears from people who need movies to reduce them to tears and snot. The years pass the cultural importance of Kate Moss absurdly comes up (""Do you believe the magic of her lies in her history?"" asks the future editor of major novelists) and the manuscript of a Very Important Writer is put in a shredder. The rain sequence here occurs during the exchange of vows and its inane. But Curtis turns it into a gorgeous epic of slow-motion disaster. Its The Poseidon Adventure of weddings. McAdams gets luminously wet. Otherwise she doesnt have enough to do. As Tims tony parents Bill Nighy and Lindsay Duncan are droll and toast-dry. But the film is entirely Gleesons. The son of the robust Irish actor Brendan Gleeson hes a ladle of a man with a great big smile and oft-furrowed brow. His gawky adoration portends a new era of movie men. If he catches on it means audiences prefer a star wholl dote serve and protect. Theyll want a perfect man who looks less than perfect -- a super-husband super-father and super-friend. Even in a work of science fiction like this Gleeson seems beyond real. All those foam-faces being made in the dark? Theyre for him.

Universal Pictures Back in 1999 Malcolm D. Lees The Best Man was a winning sensitive ensemble comedy that showcased the talents of some of our best black actors. It didnt make boatloads of money but it did pretty well proving yet again that there was real opportunity -- both financial and artistic -- in going after a midmarket African-American audience. Since then of course with more flamboyant (and lets just say it less accomplished) movies from folks like Tyler Perry crowding the marketplace The Best Man feels like the product of a bygone era. It was soft and fuzzy but it also had a certain unvarnished honesty a surprising intimacy that lent credibility to the characters forthright discussions about relationships and sex. For The Best Man Holiday the characters are back albeit at later stages in their lives. Harper (Taye Diggs) is no longer a young author with a hot new novel but a guy whose books have stopped selling; meanwhile his wife Robyn (Sanaa Lathan) is pregnant with their first child. Talented athlete Lance (Morris Chestnut) is now at the end of a storied NFL career about to retire to spend more time with his lovely wife Mia (Monica Calhoun) and their gaggle of kids. Jordan (Nia Long) whom Harper was once madly in love with is a high-powered executive at MSNBC (with a cool and somewhat Don Draper-like white boyfriend played by Eddie Cibrian). Theres also committed single Quentin (Terence Howard) and straitlaced Julian (Harold Perrineau) who married former stripper Candace (Regina Hall) and started a school. Anyway the gangs all here -- but theyre not really doing anything. The Best Man Holiday feels more like an accessory than a sequel. This time instead of a wedding weve got a holiday reception at Lances immense mansion. Thats as good an excuse as any to get them all together in the same place again but the years have made them a bit less interesting a bit less distinct. The mild little nuggets of plot -- Harper wants to convince Lance to let him co-write his autobiography -- dont do much to carry us along. The reverential intros are still here The characters often show up accompanied by smooth pop music and smiles. But while they felt like a fun generous bit of stylization in the original here they feel overbaked.A  Similarly in the earlier film each character ably represented a different philosophy of love and relationships Lance was the womanizer transformed by the love of a good woman; Harper was the agitated romantic for whom everything had to be perfect; Quentin was the unrepentant dawg; etc. But theres a thin line between an archetype and a cliche and The Best Man Holiday is not as successful as its predecessor about not crossing it. Still the actors continue to have an ease around each other that sells some of the films sillier bits. A conversation about blow jobs doesnt quite feel as candid as it might have in the first film but it still has its own energy -- in part because we buy the idea that these people have known each other for years.A  The Best Man Holiday eventually does go to some surprisingly dark places -- to say more would definitely constitute a spoiler -- and the final act of the film is a mixed bag. Its hard not to feel like were being manipulated but even here there are occasional moments of honesty sold mainly by the actors understated delivery and patience and by the fact that director Lee knows not to get in the way. The Best Man Holiday is an inelegant movie but its cast is so damn likable that were still willing to follow them -- even when theyre not going anywhere.

Lee Starring Taye Diggs Morris Chestnut Melissa De Sousa Terrence Howard Classification 14A Country USA Language English God Family Football is the title of the biography that one character in The Best Man Holiday is writing about another but its a pretty nifty alt-title for a movie that does to your emotions exactly what one player does to another on the big Christmas game day slams them to the ground and stomps them silly. Handout Video Video Weekend movie pick Short Term 12 will change your view on millennials Handout Video Video Weekend movie pick Blue is the Warmest Colour is raw beautiful A sequel to the 1999 movie The Best Man The Best Man Holiday gathers the same super pretty ensemble cast - then graduating from college now mostly made millionaires - in order to see if the seasonal spirit of peace on Earth can trump the rest of the years petty resentments. Like the game itself it proves a tough and tight match.Set mostly in the impossibly huge New Jersey crib of star football player Lance (Morris Chestnut) - the house is so big it doesnt even seem to have any neighbouring domiciles or even a street for them to be on - The Best Man Holiday begins the week before Christmas as the invites to the Sullivan familys big holiday sleepover summon our peeps into the 21st century. Theres Harper (Taye Diggs) the formerly bestselling author whos secretly planning a book about Lance as a way to reinstall himself on the bestseller list; Jordan (Nia Long) whos made a major business splash in Manhattan; Shelby (Melissa De Sousa) now a fearsomely intimidating cleavage-wielding ""Real Wife of Westchester""; Quentin (Terrence Howard) still stoned after all these years; and the eternally loving Mia (Monica Calhoun) married to Lance and now facing a personal tragedy that will prove instrumental in getting all these superannuated fortyish teenagers to finally grow up and hoist the mistletoe.Traditionally Christmas movies are about the power of the holiday spirit to conquer all in the name of seasonal detente and The Best Man Holiday although sprinkled with bad behaviour and salty bon mots is traditional right to the twinkly-tipped top of the tree. It sprints gamely through the endless corridors of the Sullivan manse as inspirationally as Lance himself does on that Christmas Day playing field and the forgiveness it preaches extends to the forgiveness it asks. Why would we care about the petty personal tribulations of all these beautiful people cavorting through a house that God Himself might get lost in? Because its Christmas dummy.Special to The Globe and Mail Report Typo/Error Follow us on Twitter GlobeArts Comments AA In the know Life This woman became a middle-age man magnet.

Credit Michael Gibson/Universal Studios The writer-director Malcolm D. Lee gathers the crew of friends from his 1999 debut ""The Best Man"" for a Christmas reunion. In this follow-up the struggling author Harper (Taye Diggs) and the football god Lance (Morris Chestnut) are wary former pals. Julian (Harold Perrineau) discovers that his wife Candy (Regina Hall) has a past preserved in a video online. And its not immediately apparent why anyone still puts up with the troublemaking television diva Shelby (Melissa De Sousa).Theyre all under the same roof specifically the comfortable home of Lance the everlastingly gracious Mia (Monica Calhoun) and their polite offspring. But if the soapy dramas that emerge out of the movies status-anxiety comedy feel predictable and unhappily tilted against the women having stars with some charisma helps especially Terrence Howard as the unrepentant horndog Quentin. Mr. Lee is unrepentant too in embracing familiar Hollywood elements terminal illness a big football game pregnancy and innocent children lip-syncing songs.Mr. Lees film is more traditional than its sexually frank humor might indicate with faith and charity ultimately given pride of place (right alongside human pettiness). But even if some of the crudeness and the drama feel forced its hard to hate. The Best Man Holiday Director Malcolm D. Lee Writer Malcolm D.

Photo Universal Pictures MOVIE REVIEW The Best Man Holiday Maybe second best. Running time 122 minutes. Rated R (profanity crude humor drug use sexual references adult themes). At the Lincoln Square the Magic Johnson the E-Walk others. A likable cast and interior-decor porn worthy of Martha Stewart Living are the highlights of ""The Best Man Holiday"" but the mix of raunchy sex comedy and Christian faith doesnt quite come off. Fourteen years after ""The Best Man"" showcased such then-young actors as Taye Diggs Morris Chestnut and Terrence Howard the former college friends they play reunite for a Christmas weekend at a suburban mansion owned by Chestnuts character a star running back about to break a record for the New York Giants. The first half of the movie sets up several thin dramas Writer Harper (Diggs) is having trouble getting published as bills pile up but hes afraid to ask his former best buddy Lance (Chestnut) to hire him to ghostwrite a memoir while Harpers wife Robyn (Sanaa Lathan) prepares to deliver their child who is endangered by being in a breach position. Meanwhile private school administrator Julian (Harold Perrineau) frets about his stripper wife Candys (Regina Hall) sexual past as revealed in a YouTube video and his slutty ex Shelby (Melissa De Sousa) is now a reality-show star and loose cannon. Harpers ex Jordan (Nia Long) brings along a new white boyfriend. And skirt-chasing party boy Quentin (Howard) hangs around texting out pictures of his own junk. Writer-director Malcolm D. Lee (cousin of Spike) retains his customary light touch and good nature but theres no getting around the problem that his jokes are trite and weak. If a kids name is August Lee has someone approach to say ""You must be July."" The director loves to stage awkward double-takes and ""No no youve got the wrong idea"" moments as when two people in a friendly embrace are surprised by a third party walking into the room at exactly the wrong instant. When really stretching for a laugh Lee has everyone sit around talking about porn or sends Howard wandering around the house without his pants. ""The Big Chill"" this is not and Lee doesnt quite know where to go with the mild quandaries the characters face. After much leering and joking for instance it turns out that Julians suspicions about his wifes past are absolutely correct but everyone shrugs it off. A similar resolution awaits the problem of whether Harper will write Lances autobiography. Yet in the second half Lee conjures up some genuine emotion as things turn more serious and the ever-reliable Chestnut shines. His Lance at first grouchy is revealed to be a man with a solid foundation who shrugs at his prospects of breaking the all-time NFL rushing record on Christmas. Instead when asked whats important in life he says ""God. Family. Football. In that order."" The bond between him and his wife Mia (Monica Calhoun) and their children gives the film its heart and you could do worse than watch their adorable girls sing ""O Holy Night"" by the piano. For all of its appealing actors the films true stars are those gorgeous sets -- lush immaculate sparkling and vast. Seeing this movie is like moving into Williams-Sonoma for two hours. If only the script were as tasteful.

(AP Photo/Universal Pictures Michael Gibson) The Best Man Holiday"" the sequel to a well-liked African-American rom-com from 1999 has so much going on that it also couldve been titled ""The Best Man Birth"" ""The Best Man Engagement"" or ""The Best Man Reunion.""Even ""The Best Man Funeral"" wouldve made sense. But who wants to see that?A full plate of tear-jerking drama is served here. And its even tastier than the first time around. The first story ""The Best Man"" revolved around a group of college friends portrayed by Terrence Howard Taye Diggs Morris Chestnut Sanaa Lathan Nia Long Harold Perrineau and more reassembled years later for a wedding.One of the friends Harper (Diggs) was a writer with a hot property on his hands -- a thinly veiled story revealing all his friends dirt including his own. The tension in the group comes to a head on the eve of football star Lances (Chestnut) wedding to Mia (Monica Calhoun).The new movie opens with the final scene from the original the wedding then quickly catches viewers up what has been happening with the ensemble using a series of clips photos and magazine covers (Nelly is featured in one of them).Fourteen years later in ""The Best Man Holiday"" the gang is together to celebrate Christmas at Lances estate a somewhat ill-conceived ideathrusting exes hook-ups and near-hookups together under one roof.Robin (Lathan) is a chef and is pregnant with her and Harpers first child. Harper has writers block and needs a hit and is in desperate need of a hit. Family man Lance is retiring from football. Julian (Perrineau) has married his stripper girlfriend Candy (Regina Hall) and they have children and now run a charter school together. Jordan (Long) is a TV producer dating Brian (Eddie Cibrian) a new addition to the story. Shelby (Melissa De Sousa) stars in the latest ""Real Housewives"" franchise. And the hilarious Quentin (Howard) is still Quentin.Lance has lingering resentment from events in the first film. Though reading Harpers book he learned that his best friend Harper and Mia slept together. And the suggestion that Harper can revive his career by writing Lances memoir is a bomb waiting to explode. But the film takes an unexpected turn one that gives it new heft when one of the major characters takes ill.From there its a bit of a guessing game if and when the character dies. (Will it be when the character falls into the Christmas tree while singing a Christmas song or perhaps for extra dramatic effect on Christmas morning?)Director Malcolm D. Lee scored big in getting every member of the ensemble to return. Each of them is as engaging as before even when forced to lip-sync an old New Edition song something recently seen in ""Baggage Claim.""Though not so warm and fuzzy as some fans may expect ""The Best Man Holiday"" is a more than fitting return that improves upon the original in unexpected ways.What ""The Best Man Holiday""  Three stars out of four  Rated R  Run time 204  Content Language sexual content and brief nudity Kevin C.

Starring Monica Calhoun Taye Diggs and Morris Chestnut. Directed by Malcolm D. Lee. (Rated R. 121 minutes.) The people in ""The Best Man Holiday"" - not just the actors but the characters they play - deserved a better script than this. Thats an odd thing to say or even think because if we know these characters only through the script and if we care about the characters enough to want good things for them then the script cant be all bad. And its not all bad. Its just part bad It suffers from cliches and corniness from the same kinds of scenes played over and over and from more false endings than the last ""Lord of the Rings"" movie. Even its first moments are clumsy with a credits sequence in which were introduced to eight characters and are expected to track who is who who is with whom and what they all do for a living. Throughout writer-director Malcolm D. Lee hurries up when he needs to take his time and lavishes time on scenes he doesnt need. And yet ""The Best Man Holiday"" has something. It introduces us to a group of people who are complex and engaging and it places those people in relationships that are believable. These characters all of them black professionals in their early 40s - all of them friends for years - come together for a long Christmas weekend. The hosts are a football star (Morris Chestnut) soon to retire and his saintly wife Mia (Monica Calhoun). But our doorway into the story is Harper (Taye Diggs) a former best-selling novelist who has hit a financial wall just as his wife (Sanaa Lathan) is about to give birth to their first child. In brutal succession Harper loses his teaching gig at NYU and finds out that his new novel has no takers. His only shot at a big payday is to persuade his football star friend to let him ghost his autobiography - a prospect complicated by the fact that he and his former best buddy have been estranged for years. The movie is at its best in the first hour as we follow Harper and experience through him the awkwardness of having to maintain a successful facade while he experiences the internal humiliation of scheming for a writing assignment he considers beneath him. Lee knows that even among close friends there is often an implied hierarchy determined by ones professional success and he conveys this with precision and subtlety. But then ""The Best Man Holiday"" takes its focus off of Harpers tensions and charges headlong into what the filmmaker probably thinks of as a more emotional and affecting direction - and it is in a way. There are some heartrending moments. But mostly the last half of the film is boilerplate tearjerker with scenes youve seen over and over in other better movies and with dialogue thats occasionally cringe-inducing. The last half hour is a complete mess but a weird experience too in even after we give up on the movie we dont give up on the characters. Its as if the storys collapse isnt just our misfortune as spectators but theirs too. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

VPC Claudia Puig USA TODAY 603 p.m. EST November 14 2013Less would have been more in this jam-packed not-so-jolly holiday. Humor is weighed down by contrivances and sentimentality though the cast is generally appealing.Taye Diggs left Morris Chestnut Harold Perrineau and Terrence Howard perform in The Best Man Holiday.(Photo Michael Gibson Universal Pictures)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY  out of fourStars Monica Calhoun Morris Chestnut Melissa De Sousa Taye Diggs Terrence Howard Regina HallRated R; Runtime 2 hours 2 minutes; opens Friday nationwideFaith football flirting and fisticuffs are a big part of the festivities in The Best Man Holiday.This reunion ( out of four; rated R; opens Friday nationwide) of major players from the 1999 rom-com The Best Man is as rowdy and rooted in religion as its predecessor which also starred Morris Chestnut Taye Diggs Terrence Howard and Harold Perrineau as college friends.Nearly 15 years have elapsed since the original film so the opening credits feel like a backward-looking trailer. Highlights of the first movie are cobbled together in a chain of visual snippets and catchy phrases. It doesnt work and the scattered montage leads to a cluttered movie. Only a few charming tidbits are nestled snugly in this over-stuffed Christmas stocking.Merriment and light mayhem during a long Christmas weekend house party at a stately mansion are overshadowed by the melodramatic treatment of terminal disease. The setting is like the American equivalent of Downton Abbey and the intrigue and gossip could rival the BBC show.REVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersHOLIDAY MOVIE CALENDAR NovemberThe estate is inhabited by football star Lance Sullivan (Chestnut) his wife Mia (Monica Calhoun) and their four young children. Lance and Mia are hosting seven college pals for a few days of what is meant to be luxurious relaxation and yuletide celebration. But amid the tree trimming and dinner parties secrets are exposed old wounds reopen and pummeling ensues.Its mystifying why people portrayed as intelligent successful attractive and good-hearted have to descend into catfights and brawling worthy of the worst reality TV.Harper Stewart (Diggs) wrote a best seller about his college years but is in a writing slump. To make matter worse he just lost his day job. Hes understandably worried about the future given that his wife Robyn (Sanaa Lathan) is due to give birth on New Years Eve.His agent (John Michael Higgins) suggests he write a book about his famous footballer buddy Lance so Harper conducts covert research during the weekend.Lance has clear-cut values God family and football. But he sure can hold a grudge. Hes never forgiven Harper for having a one-night stand with Mia back in college. He kneels in prayer quite a bit during the movie.And speaking of falling on ones knees there is a lovely rendition of O Holy Night by the only occasionally seen children of the revelers.In contrast a scene depicting all the couples coupling to the accompaniment of The Christmas Song seems a weird marriage of visuals and musical accompaniment. Chestnuts roasting hardly seem the lyrics to inspire thoughts of carnal pleasures. But maybe chestnuts light the fires of writer-director Malcolm D. Lee. Or he figured a holiday-inspired romantic montage was necessary to gird us for the nasty spats and resentments that ensue.Some funny lines (including a risque interpretation of the term ""stimulus package"") and comical repartee are interspersed among the maudlin moments. But too many major life events and career climaxes are packed into these few days. Despite some likable performances from this appealing ensemble cast -- and Diggs stands above the pack -- sentimental schmaltz competes with slapstick silliness for an uneven result.The contrived story suffers from holiday season clutter. Its like the movie version of The 12 Days of Christmas Eleven players footballing seven friends ladling food for the needy four buddies dancing two ladies fighting and one baby born in a speeding SUV. 385 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 48 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1hJEHOwHoliday Movies Calendar NovemberTake a look at the films heading to the box office this November complete with trailers reviews previews and more.

"Best Man Holiday The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; best-man-holiday-the ) Best Man Holiday The (United States 2013) November 14 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli In the normal course of things a sequel would be unlikely for a 14-year old film whose box office performance while profitable wasnt exceptional. (The Best Man made for about 9 million grossed north of 3.5 times that during its theatrical run.) However in todays risk-averse climate where familiar characters placed in predictable narratives are desirable Universal Pictures saw an opportunity for a holiday-themed success by greenlighting Malcolm D. Lees The Best Man Holiday a follow-up that resulted from a desire on the part of the cast and filmmaker to make a reunion. (It seems to me theres an apostrophe-s missing from the title but maybe thats being picky.) Like the original The Best Man the comedic aspects exist to provide some levity to a screenplay with drama-based inclinations. The Best Man Holiday however suffers from melodramatic oversaturation and an ending that seems determined to offer closure to even minor subplots - and there are plenty of those. Although the first half is an appealing mix of mostly understated humor and light drama the second half trajectory tends toward the obvious and director Lee turns up the manipulation as he pilfers shamelessly from Terms of Endearment one of the worst films ever to win a Best Picture Oscar. After starting out as a character-based ensemble piece The Best Man Holiday turns into a predictable affair determined to hit as many familiar beats as possible while striving to wring tears and cheers in equal quantities from its audience. The Best Man Holiday catches up with most of the characters from The Best Man about fifteen years after the earlier film. Harper (Taye Diggs) the author whose book caused unpleasantness in the first movie has fallen on hard times. He and his wife Robyn (Sanaa Lanthan) are expecting their first child but hes out of work blocked as a writer and drowning in debt. He accepts a Christmas party invitation from his estranged best friend Lance (Morris Chestnut) and Lances wife Mia (Monica Calhoun) in the hope that he might be able to nab the rights to pen Lances biography. An NFL star Lance is approaching retirement with a chance at breaking the all-time rushing record. Also spending the weekend at the festively decorated New York-area mansion are Harpers ex-flame Jordan (Nia Long) and her new boyfriend Brian (Eddie Cibrian); couple Julian (Harold Perrineau) and ex-stripper Candace (Regina Hall); brassy and bitchy Shelby (Melissa De Sousa); and flamboyant uncensored Quentin (Terrance Howard). Over the course of the few days spent under one roof old wounds are re-opened new injuries are created and a tragedy brings everyone together. Some of the things that rubbed me the wrong way are likely to be embraced as crowd-pleasing elements. Thats the way it goes with viewer manipulation. Lee is unquestionably adept at playing on the audiences emotions but theres no subtlety in the way he goes about it. His orchestration of Lances final game and the events surrounding it are designed to generate maximum impact even though theyre so overcooked that its almost impossible to take them seriously. Is it a really a spoiler to say that it all comes down to a 4th-and-goal play in a close game with only a few seconds remaining on the clock? The entire screenplay is pitched on this level. Its written to be appreciated on a superficial level and for those looking for something shallow it works. Although this is an ensemble piece some actors have more screen time than others. Taye Diggs Morris Chestnut Sanaa Lathan Monica Calhoun and Nia Long would be considered the leads with the story being told from Harpers perspective. Diggs plays him with warmth and respect; hes a flawed man desperately trying to reclaim a past success while struggling with the twin challenges of impending fatherhood and unemployment. Likewise Morris Chestnuts Lance offers an atypical portrait of a football player intelligent and compassionate he lives by the creed of ""God Family Football."" Chestnuts portrayal is authentic and credible. On the female side Monica Calhoun gets all the best scenes and plays them with Kleenex-selling capability although Nia Long and Sanaa Lathan are nearly as good. Stealing scenes left and right is Terrence Howard whos on hand primarily for comedic relief and fills that role admirably. Although the trappings are those of a Christmas movie - there are lights trees and a surfeit of mostly modern carols - The Best Man Holiday would work as effectively viewed in June as in December. (Although I dont think Ive ever heard Nat King Coles ""Christmas Song"" used for the purposes employed here.) Its very good at what it sets out to do. The problem is that it doesnt aim particularly high and when the tears have dried and the cheers have subsided theres a sense that what the movie offers is disappointingly ephemeral. Movies about the inevitability of mortality should have a more lasting impact but the crowd-pleasing mentality underpinning The Best Man Holiday guarantees that its easily forgotten once the end credits roll.

(Michael Gibson/AP) By Ann Hornaday November 14 2013 Follow AnnHornaday Has it really been nearly 15 years? In 1999 ""The Best Man"" became a hit romantic comedy a launching pad for several of its attractive gifted young stars and part of an amazing wave of African American rom-coms that included ""Love amp; Basketball"" ""Love Jones"" ""Soul Food"" and ""How Stella Got Her Groove Back."" Its taken writer-director Malcolm D. Lee this long to deliver a sequel ""The Best Man Holiday"" but his timing is propitious. Not only has his ensemble aged remarkably well but his film also is once again part of an exciting time in black film in this case a year that has spanned the reassuring uplift of ""42"" and ""Lee Daniels The Butler"" the searing history of ""12 Years a Slave"" and such vibrant contemporary stories as ""Fruitvale Station"" and ""Newlyweeds."" Oh yes and ""Peeples"" and ""Baggage Claim"" which share more than a little DNA with ""The Best Man"" which was that rare Hollywood movie that presented African American life not as an urban ""problem"" but as a lush wish-fulfillment fantasy of prosperity friendship and faith. Those principles also propel ""The Best Man Holiday"" which begins with an efficient sequence of flashbacks and updates Harper (Taye Diggs) after becoming a bestselling author hasnt written a book for a while (hint hint Mr. Lee?). His wife Robyn (Sanaa Lathan) a successful chef is nine months pregnant with their first child. Lance (Morris Chestnut) is a star running back for the New York Giants and his wife Mia (Monica Calhoun) serenely looks after their sprawling New Jersey estate and impeccably behaved four children. Jordan (Nia Long) is a hard-charging executive at MSNBC Quentin (Terrence Howard) is a music impresario Julian and Candace (Harold Perrineau Regina Hall) have opened their own school and Shelby (Melissa De Sousa) it will surprise no one to know has become the star of Bravos ""Real Housewives of Westchester."" When the gang gathers at Lances palatial pad for a days-long Christmas party some long-standing tensions re-emerge culminating in at least one epic cat fight a stunning tragic turn and a delicious dance number from the guys set to vintage New Edition. Like a long-lost soap opera emerging from a Rip Van Winkle-length hiatus ""The Best Man Holiday"" has lost none of its often baggy saggy melodrama; luckily when things get too soppy Howard can be depended on for crude one-liners that land with all the more finesse thanks to his smoky slightly stoned delivery. And ""The Best Man Holiday"" has clearly caught up with the times with one plot point revolving around social media run amok off-handedly invoking everyone from Barack Obama (natch) to Melissa Harris-Perry Olivia Pope and Robin Thicke. That last name-check comes by way of Shelby when she meets Jordans new boyfriend played with square-jawed appeal by Eddie Cibrian. Theres no denying that the maudlin message-y machinery of ""The Best Man Holiday"" often threatens to collapse of its own self-conscious weight. This is a one-two-three-four hankie movie that misses no opportunity to wring a few tears no matter how shameless. Lees efforts to imbue his often profane sexually ribald proceedings with religiosity can be heavy-handed especially when Lances attempt to break the all-time rushing record somehow becomes a proxy for a holy life-and-death struggle. But its refreshing to see characters for whom prayer and spiritual service are an everyday part of life. And as with the first film its the actors who bring warmth humanity and compulsive watchability to every moment of ""The Best Man Holiday"" no matter how ersatz overprocessed or manipulative. In other words you dont go to ""The Best Man Holiday"" to deconstruct its flaws. You go for its myriad adamantly un-cerebral pleasures. You go to see Chestnut take that shirt off. You go to giggle at Howard then come up short during a frank and unexpectedly moving encounter when he talks about money with one of his friends. And you go to take in the quietly regal Calhoun whose subdued performance sneaks up and grabs you while you thought you were laughing at something else. You go simply to take in the fineness beauty and charisma of everyone involved in ""The Best Man Holiday"" which -- in the age of Obama and Olivia Pope and ""The Butler"" and ""12 Years a Slave"" and ""Baggage Claim"" -- its once-starved audiences may finally be able to take for granted. Fourteen years ago ""The Best Man"" was firmly rooted in a niche part of a mini-trend that wasnt guaranteed to last. Today ""The Best Man Holiday"" possesses all the strengths and weaknesses of banal high-gloss mainstream entertainment Its boringly bracingly gratifyingly conventional. No shame in that game.   1/2 R. At area theaters. Contains profanity sexual content and brief nudity. 122 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Spinning Plates [?][?][?] out of four stars Rated Unrated by the MPAA suitable for all audiences. In English and subtitled Spanish. Theater Lagoon. Even if ""Top Chef"" cooking shows are on your DVR ignore list Joseph Levys touching documentary ""Spinning Plates"" is worth your while. Levy himself a creator of reality TV restaurant shows presents three wildly diverse restaurants and the personalities behind them. Atop the food chain theres Alinea Chicagos temple of ""molecular gastronomy"" whose world-renowned chef Grant Achatz combines advanced techniques and science lab equipment to turn out odd delicacies like edible balloons and desserts served with a crown of flaming maple leaves. Breitbachs Country Dining in Balltown Iowa has served its community for 150 years and the newest generation of the family pounds out fried chicken and raspberry pies with dedication and not a little love. Finally theres Tucsons La Cocina de Gabby where Francisco and Gabby Martinez see a modest cafe offering Mexican home cooking as a way to bootstrap their way into financial security. While the dramatic conflicts in the film are set up in a rather rote manner (meet the personalities fret over their setbacks sigh at the resolution) the human stories here are undeniably moving. The overachieving too-cool-for-school Achatz commands admiration but not until we delve into his poignant back story and his experience of a life-changing crisis does he elicit our full empathy. The Breitbachs bustling restaurant-cum-community-center experiences a staggering stroke of bad luck followed by an even more astonishing turn of fate. The financial tribulations facing the Martinez clan are exasperating precisely because theyre so commonplace. This is a movie about the food of life -- dreams family health and work -- as much as Michelin ratings and breakfast burritos. Great Expectations [?][?] out of four star Rated PG-13 for some violence including disturbing images. Theater Edina. Universal Pictures Regina Hall and Harold Perrineau in a scene from the sentimental ""The Best Man Holiday."" With its prestigious literary roots and casting coups (Ralph Fiennes as scary Magwitch Helena Bonham Carter as dotty/evil Miss Havisham) the anticipation for ""Great Expectations"" was well great. The film itself feels like its only halfway there a dress rehearsal for a better version. Directed with the best of intentions by Mike Newell (""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"") its a respectful restrained adaptation of the riotously inventive Charles Dickens whose grab-bag novels teem with wild characters and mad events yoked together by force. Newell gives us a tepid rundown of the ups and downs and ups of Pip a rustic blacksmiths boy elevated to London gentility through a mysterious endowment. Sometimes Newells images are fresh. The graveyard where Pip fatefully encounters the escaped convict Magwitch is not a dim horror set but a sunny country churchyard. The fine apartment Pip occupies in his snooty big-city adulthood is painted a garish shade of lavender that sums up the empty frivolity of upper-class life in the capital. Pip is a reactive character maneuvered through life like a marionette by multiple guardians some malign others well-intentioned. Played as an adult by Jeremy Irvine (""The War Horse"") hes a wishy-washy anemic fellow especially compared with some of the electric supporting players. Bonham Carter is sardonic and more than a little demented as the mad spinster Miss Havisham reviving a character usually played as a stock hag. Robbie Coltrane gives the scheming lawyer Jaggers a shifty intelligence and a soothing Orson Welles speaking voice the better to sedate his victims. Olly Alexander has such fun as Pips friend Herbert Pocket a kindhearted twit he seems to be holding his laughter inside. The crucial central roles go wanting. Fiennes as Magwitch adopts a Cockney growl and observes Pip with intense searching eyes but doesnt create a character. As Miss Havishams ice-cold adoptive daughter Estella Holliday Granger is defeated by an ambivalent emotionally inconsistent character that must be as baffling to actresses as she is to readers. Her plastic beauty is emblematic of a handsomely composed but hollow film desperately in need of flamboyant circus energy. The Best Man Holiday [?] out of four stars Rated R for language sexual content and brief nudity. Pure drivel. A charismatic cast grapples with sledgehammer sentimentality and hackneyed story lines in this belated sequel to 1999s ""The Best Man."" The upscale African-American twentysomethings of writer/director Malcolm D. Lees original reassemble for a Christmas reunion more mature but still prone to getting tangled in plot contrivances. Harper (Taye Diggs) a novelist whose early success has petered out is advised by his publisher to write a biography of his frenemy Lance a football superstar on the cusp of retirement. Private school headmaster Julian (Harold Perrineau) has lost a key donor because of a YouTube video of his wife back in her days as an exotic dancer. Quentin (Terrence Howard) a put-down artist and player fires zingers from the sidelines. And the ladies of the group (Monica Calhoun Regina Hall Sanaa Lathan Nia Long and Melissa De Sousa) go about the usual relationship comedy/drama business of catty sniping commiserating over illness beaming over pregnancy and negotiating lovers quarrels. The crisis- and resolution-packed last half-hour plays like a Soap Opera Network highlights reel.

To read the whole story subscribe to BostonGlobe.com The Best Man Holiday Share Comment The last time we saw the nine raucous irresistible college buddies of ""The Best Man Holiday"" was back in the Clinton administration when we met them in 1999s ""The Best Man."" Much has changed in the professional fortunes and romantic relationships of the characters since then but one thing that has stayed the same is their sassy dialog - from writer/director Malcolm D. Lee - and the casts talent for delivering it with panache nuance and expert timing. That and Lees unfortunate weakness for trite bromides and pat plot resolutions. Luckily theres a lot to keep us entertained before things take a turn for the worse. Full story for BostonGlobe.com subscribers.

"The Best Man Holiday 4 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article The Best Man Holiday 4 stars Taye Diggs from the film The Best Man Holiday. Universal Pictures. SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED VIDEO ""The Best Man Holiday"" trailer By Randy Cordova The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Nov 14 2013 1125 AM There didnt seem to be a burning need to catch up with the characters from ""The Best Man"" 14 years after the film was released. That said the sequel ""The Best Man Holiday"" is surprisingly engaging. Think of it as a reunion with a particularly likable group of friends. One reason the movie works so well Writer-director Malcolm D. Lee returns from the original so the characters feel true to the first film. Secondly most of the cast is back and they have the kind of comfortable chemistry you cant fake. Its easy to believe these people have a history together. After a title sequence updates viewers on the characters things move quickly. The gang of former college pals is gathering for the holidays at the gorgeous home of Lance (Morris Chestnut) a football player in his final season with the Giants and his wife Mia (Monica Calhoun). Former best man Harper (Taye Diggs) is a writer whose career is stumbling so he hopes to pitch Lance on the idea of ghost-writing his autobiography. His wife Robin (Sanaa Lathan) is expecting their first child. There is also Candace (Regina Hall) whose past as a stripper has resurfaced which could damage her marriage to Julian (Harold Perrineau). Jordan (Nia Long) is a successful businesswoman who brings along a new boyfriend (Eddie Cibrian dubbed a ""tall vanilla latte"" by one of the women). For comic relief throw in Shelby (Melissa De Sousa) the star of a reality-TV franchise and weed-smoking businessman Quentin (Terrence Howard). Thats a lot of characters but they all seem to complement each other. You cant imagine removing one without upsetting the balance of comedy and drama that Lee has achieved. Members of the group fight flirt break up and reconcile. There are tears laughter and even a choreographed dance sequence. Somehow Lee manages to keeps a tight grasp on everything. Your belief may occasionally be strained but he never pushes things too far. Everything stays in the realm of possibility -- soapy possibilities sure but it is all plausible. The cast is great fun each getting his or her own moment to shine. Diggs in particular ties everything together with an easygoing charm masking his characters desperation. Howard and De Sousa can detonate punch lines for the fullest effect. Calhoun adds layers to a role that initially feels like a one-note character. At times the movie recalls the vacationing-couples premise of ""Why Did I Get Married?"" while other moments feel like they wandered over from ""Steel Magnolias."" Still that doesnt detract from the movies breezy charms or Lees spirited direction. Reach the reporter at randy.cordovaarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849. Twitter.com/randy_cordova.

"The Best Man Holiday falls short of original review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Best Man Holiday falls short of original reviewTheres a lot to like among the engaging cast in this sequel before it becomes just another sugary seasonal romcom.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Nov. 14 2013The Best Man Holiday Starring Morris Chestnut Taye Diggs Regina Hall Terrence Howard Sanaa Lathan Nia Long Harold Perrineau Monica Calhoun Melissa De Sousa and Eddie Cibrian. Directed by Malcolm D. Lee. 120 minutes. Opens Nov. 15. See Star listings for theatres and show times. 14AThe Best Man Holiday is akin to getting a massive gorgeously wrapped Christmas present and opening it to find a pair of socks. With its hugely likable cast especially Terrence Howards (Hustle amp; Flow) amusingly return as trash-talking scene-stealing Quentin theres a lot to like in the first half of Malcolm D. Lees buddy reunion sequel.Article Continued BelowThe letdown of finding an unimaginative cinematic gift comes in the second half as The Best Man Holiday collapses under the weight of a two-hour overdramatic slog. Or to quote Quentin ""That was some melodramatic s---""The smart sophisticated African American college pals from 1999s The Best Man are back together for the holidays invited to spend a cool Yule complete with printed agenda of events by Mia (Monica Calhoun). Shes married to pro football sensation Lance (charismatic Morris Chestnut) a godly man who is preparing to retire from a stellar career with the New York Giants.They live with their four perfect kids in a miniature version of Versailles outside New York City with a Christmas tree in the foyer that looks like it was borrowed from Rockefeller Center.A lot has happened in the 14 years since Lances and Mias wedding the event that brought the pals together in The Best Man. Were brought up to speed in a flash as the movie opens yet those who missed the first film may find the various storylines side plots and old wounds confusing.Harper (Taye Diggs) the best man from the first film whose fictionalized book based on the groups private lives led to bad blood between him and Lance is going through a rough patch creatively and otherwise.Harpers wife Robyn (Sanaa Lathan) is now a celebrity chef and in the late stages of a difficult pregnancy while tart-tongued siren Shelby (Melissa De Sousa) has landed on her stiletto-shod feet nicely thanks to a role on a Real Housewives-style show. Spunky Jordan (Nia Long) has a big-money TV exec job -- and a white boyfriend.As for Julian (Harold Perrineau) hes running a private school with his wife Candace (Regina Hall) a former exotic dancer whose past is becoming a present problem.And then theres good-time guy Quentin. Hes running a successful marketing firm and living the good life while avoiding getting tied down romantically.Their reunion offers an opportunity to air old grievances and repeat past mistakes. Theres also deception foot; Harper is hoping to get enough material out of his stay to pen an unauthorized bio of Lance envisioning a redeeming return to the bestseller list.The various slapstick elements sexy banter and verbal smackdowns make for good fun even if things do get confusing with various stories in play. As before Lee includes some very witty material and sharp topical lines that generate laughs bolstered here by a terrific pop holiday soundtrack.But then the writer-director arrives at the second half and drains the charm from the picture swapping it for a secret reveal that spins the film in a completely different direction. Fun time over we get religious lectures tears and soul searching while audiences may be left wondering what they did to suddenly end up on the naughty list. Who invited Tyler Perry to this clambake?The Best Man broke fresh ground in 1999 showcasing talented and engaging young African American actors in a smartly urban version of ensemble-cast romcoms that helped expand the genre.Its disappointing that after such a promising beginning The Best Man Holiday becomes just another sugary seasonal confection although thanks to Howards Quentin we get enough sass with the sugar to make it at least somewhat worthwhile.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Lee Rating R for language sexual content and brief nudity Running time 2 hour 3 minutes Playing Throughout Orange County (See theaters and movie times)The quick hitThe sequel to a deft romantic ensemble hit tries too hard to add heartbreak uplift and religious family values messages to the comedy-drama. Grade C ""Holiday"" is the word that turns out to be the dead giveaway. This sequel to the romantic ensemble comedy ""The Best Man"" (1999) starts out bright and funny and gets more gloppy the closer the action comes to Christmas. The writer-director Malcolm D. Lee doesnt merely want his audience to (laughingly) embrace the personalities that made his first movie a hit. He also wants fans to cry and cheer and be uplifted by the spirit of the season. His high-grade banter deserves better payoffs than his trumped-up (and Trumped-up) moments of truth. Hope springs eternal - well maybe not eternal but for 40 minutes or so - when Mia (Monica Calhoun) the almost angelic wife of the New York Giants greatest running back ever Lance Sullivan (Morris Chestnut) invites their college friends for a weekend stay at their winter palace. Except for that irrepressible hedonist Quentin (Terrence Howard) and supreme narcissist Shelby (Melissa De Sousa) whos now aptly enough a Real Housewife of Westchester each old pal has a crisis or two that promises fresh comic complications. But instead of a Yuletide cornucopia you get a corny kvetch-fest. Its a good thing the Sullivans home is so fairy-tale deluxe. Youre stuck there as the hosts and guests bond and bicker size each other up in every way (including sexually) and eventually pool their financial and emotional resources to solve an array of upscale problems. Harper Stewart (Taye Diggs) once a hot novelist is now a laid-off NYU professor with his first child on the way and his biggest hope for a professional recharge would be writing Lances biography. Harpers wife Robyn (Sanaa Lathan) still feels out of sync with her hubbys over-achieving buddies and insecure over his fondness for Jordan Armstrong (Nia Long) a programming whiz at MSNBC who wont commit to her white boyfriend Brian. (Hes played by Eddie Cibrian whose ex-wife Brandi Glanville is one of the real Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.) Julian Murch (Harold Perrineau) the headmaster of a private school faces a funding shortfall after a longtime donor stumbles into an online video of his wife Candace (Regina Hall) in her stripper days. Instead of all these conflicts and calamities merging in some madcap choreography Lee delivers a free-for-all of pratfalls and platitudes. Aiming for slapstick tragedy he ends up with baggy-pants pathos. In a typical setup he wants the audience to howl with laughter when Shelby and Candace go for each others throats then go ""awww"" when Shelbys daughter asks her whether Mommy is hurt. Its a recipe for emotional whiplash. The only character who benefits from these mood swings is Howards Quentin who operates as a combination of class clown and vulgar truth-teller. He takes a direct path to basic solutions If Candace innocently asks Julian to hand over a smartphone containing her embarrassing video Quentin will just grab it and smash it to the floor. Much of the time he gazes on these suffering or self-important people like a stoned demigod of farce swimming in his own sweet vapors. What really brings everyone together is the excruciating conveniently timed slow death of a beloved character. Lee milks the pathos mercilessly. He even doubles down on it connecting the forced poignancy on the home front to a sports mini-melodrama at MetLife Stadium. On the brink of retirement Lance seizes the chance to set an NFL rushing record and bring the Giants a conference title. Since Lance is a religious man given everything else going on it takes God Himself to get him to the field. This movie is equal parts reverent and bawdy with sentimental underpinnings throughout. It wants us to laugh and cry our way to salvation. It wants to say ""God works in mysterious ways"" - except by the end it makes God work in very obvious ways. The movie has multiple climaxes and not in a good way. If a character mentions a breech birth you can be sure it will unfold in an SUV stuck in traffic en route to a hospital. And then its off to the next cliche. Time if not imagination marches on - and on. Subtitles mark the dates - ""Christmas Eve"" then ""December 28"" - as the heartbreak persists. At the end I thought it could have been worse. After all there are 12 days of Christmas.

Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday November 14 2013 1200 PM Title The Best Man Holiday Film Info R Language sexuality. Area theaters. In 1999 Malcolm D. Lee had an unexpected hit with ""The Best Man"" a romantic dramedy about African-American friends figuring life out together. It would be nice to think that viewers waited 14 years for a sequel only because everyone involved in the original was too busy working on other movies. But in an industry that still visualizes projects in black and white there may have been other factors at play. Why after all has most of this movies cast -- all talented all movie-star gorgeous -- met with only limited mainstream success? Thats not to say they havent found their footing since appearing in ""The Best Man."" Each has worked steadily in films and TV. But come on  Hollywood. Taye Diggs and Nia Long should be go-to names for any big-budget popcorn project by now. While Diggs Harper provided a focus for the first film the sequel shifts its center to Monica Calhouns Mia. After marrying in the original Mia and Lance (Morris Chestnut) a superstar Giants running back have four children and a seemingly perfect life. But Mia desperately misses her old friends who have drifted apart. So despite Lances reluctance she invites them all to their suburban mansion for Christmas. Sanaa Lathan in The Best Man Holiday (Michael Gibson) Everyone shows up but some participants are less enthusiastic than others. Best-selling author Harper has an ulterior motive for attending and doesnt realize his pregnant wife Robyn (Sanaa Lathan) is stressed about him reconnecting with former flame Jordan (Long). Similarly Candace (Regina Hall) and Shelby (Melissa De Sousa) look set to reprise their competition over Julian (Harold Perrineau) who is grappling with a shocking revelation. As for ever-mischievous bachelor Quentin (Terrence Howard) hes gleefully ready to cause trouble. Lee doesnt waste time playing catch-up so its worth watching ""The Best Man"" again before revisiting these complicated lives. As long as you know all the players youll delight in their new highs and lows makeups and breakups birth and death faith and forgiveness. (The religious element is stronger this time around.) The film does feel overlong and the tone is occasionally wobbly. But Lee keeps the pace generally steady mixing comedy and melodrama in even amounts. From l. Monica Calhoun Melissa De Sousa and Nia Long in The Best Man Holiday Most of all its a pleasure to see each of the actors enthusiastically returning to the roles that helped kickstart their careers. De Sousa bound by a thankless part in the original turns out to be a comic delight while Calhouns luminosity deepens her soapy story line. Chestnut and the Oscar-nominated Howard whove had the most box-office success are adept team players. But its Long and Diggs who really stand out with charisma to burn. The movie ends with a setup for another sequel which will undoubtedly be embraced by fans. Lets just hope we dont have to wait another 14 years to see it. On a mobile device?

Share Tweet Taye Diggs toothpaste-commercial smile--wide disingenuous with a perfectly horizontal upper lip and impeccable teeth--gets put to good use in The Best Man Holiday Malcolm D. Lees sequel to his 1999 sleeper hit The Best Man. Diggs plays Harper Stewart a has-been novelist whos bounced out of his cushy NYU gig by budget cuts. Unable to sell his latest manuscript Harper happens upon the idea of writing a biography of Lance Sullivan (Morris Chestnut) an NFL superstar who used to be his best friend. The first half of The Best Man Holiday plays like classic farce. Harper--whos been invited along with all of The Best Mans major characters to spend Christmas at the Sullivans New Jersey mansion--struggles to re-ingratiate himself with Lance all the while secretly jotting notes for his book. There are the usual shared secrets and object-switch shenanigans. Mistakenly picked-up phones iPads and notebooks tangle the characters in an increasingly absurd web of subplots. Like The Best Man the movie stakes almost everything on its superb ensemble cast which includes Terrence Howard Sanaa Lathan Monica Calhoun Harold Perrineau Nia Long Regina Hall and Melissa De Sousa. There isnt a whole lot going on in terms of style; The Best Man Holidays soundtrack (""Winter Wonderland"" ""This Christmas"" and so on) catalog-photo-ready setting and countless scenes of characters arguing imbue it with the atmosphere of a department store around mid-December. Its a testament to the actors sense of character that most of the material works despite some missteps on Lees part. (The opening credits which combine footage from the original film with Photoshopped magazine covers and newspapers are groan-worthy.) Partway through one of the characters reveals a terminal cancer diagnosis and the movie begins sliding into seriousness. While The Best Man Holiday doesnt have anything especially original to say on the subject its still refreshing to see a reunion movie set aside the usual themes of aging and reconciliation to focus on how a group deals with death. The conclusions are familiar--friendship provides support death makes squabbles seem petty whats past is past--but far from meaningless.

Lee; Release Date Wide 11/15/2013; Runtime (in minutes) 124; MPAA Rating R Posted November 20 2013 -- 1200 AM EST ""That was some melodramatic s--"" So says Quentin the bachelor troublemaker played by Terrence Howard in The Best Man Holiday. Hes talking about one of the films many heated if not hysterical fights but he might be describing the movie as a whole. Back in 1999 The Best Man was an outrageously fresh comedy of love and backbiting and not just because it marked Hollywoods belated discovery that characters could be upscale and African-American at the same time. The movie had wit verve spark and surprise. But writer-director Malcolm D. Lee shouldnt have waited 14 years to do a sequel. The Best Man Holiday reunites the characters for a Christmas-weekend house party and what ensues is like a better-written Tyler Perry movie too many life crises rooted in too much recycled backstory. The actors are winning especially Taye Diggs as the now-struggling Harper Regina Hall as the ex-stripper Candace and the great Morris Chestnut as football star Lance. But The Best Man Holiday is an eggnog thats sticky-sweet and heavy at the same time. B- Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

TWITTER Writer-director Malcolm D. Lee has re-assembled the entire nine-member cast of the original 1999 movie for this sequel. Sequels are rampant in Hollywood but its rare to see a sequel produced almost 15 years after the release of the original movie. This happens when a movie has a fan base and filmmakers and cast members are eager to revisit an earlier opus. The Best Man was a hit in 1999 partly because it appealed to a more upscale African-American audience than Hollywood ordinarily acknowledges. Now writer-director Malcolm D. Lee has re-assembled the entire nine-member cast of the original movie for The Best Man Holiday which is set at Christmas and has a good chance to succeed and also become a holiday perennial on TV and DVD. The original movie followed the romantic and professional travails of a group of college friends as they set out in the world and prepared for the wedding of two members of the gang. Although the new film refers to events in that earlier movie it isnt necessary to recall the film to enjoy this one. In the intervening years several of the college chums have remained close while others have drifted apart because of tensions that arose when they were younger. Some of them have enjoyed professional success in the intervening years while others are struggling. Most have married and have families though a couple are still unattached. When the two most affluent members of the group--pro football player Lance (Morris Chestnut) and his wife Mia (Monica Calhoun)--decide to invite the gang for a reunion over the Christmas holidays friendships and marriages are tested as new crises arise. PHOTOS Ho Ho Hollywood Tinseltowns 22 Best Christmas-Themed Movies The premise of course isnt novel. The film stirs strong memories of another reunion movie The Big Chill though the writing here is far less incisive. The key characters in addition to Lance and Mia are Harper (Taye Diggs) a struggling novelist and his wife Robyn (Sanaa Lathan) who are expecting their first child. Some of the other characters provide more comic relief. Shelby (Melissa De Sousa) is the star of a lurid TV show like Desperate Housewives while Quentin (Terrence Howard) is the bad boy of the group an aging immature Lothario who provokes and aggravates the others with his sexual byplay. Some of the crises that these characters face are more interesting than others. Harpers financial problems resonate in todays economic climate. On the other hand the uproar surrounding a video that ex-stripper Candace (Regina Hall) made many years earlier is milked much too strenuously. The film as a whole veers rather uneasily from broad comedy to teary dramatic crises  The irreverent humor works best. A catfight between Hall and De Sousa is delicious fun and Howard steals the movie with his uproarious sexual shenanigans. All of the cast members deliver smooth capable performances but this sequel clarifies why Howard has become the biggest star from the original ensemble. (He also gave one of the strongest performances in Lee Daniels The Butler this past summer.) And although the movie turns too sentimental in the final third theres no denying that there are some emotionally affecting moments to bolster the comedy. Reactions to the heavy religiosity in the last section will be mixed with some audience members appreciating this element and others tuning out. PHOTOS Falls Most Anticipated Movies The biggest problem with the movie which it shares with the original Best Man is its excessive running time. Too many endings bloat the last half-hour. We have a big football game a funeral a childbirth scene a successful book publication and even a wedding. A couple of those climaxes could have been cut without seriously weakening the film. Technically the film is polished though the gigantic mansion that Lance and Mia inhabit may be a bit excessive even for a successful sports star. Still its the glamorous trappings that set this movie apart from many others with black characters and thats clearly what the audience will turn out to see. Theres a lot of effective music in the film though the Christmas standards on the soundtrack are overused. All in all this long-delayed sequel is a very mixed bag with just enough laughter and tears to squeak by as holiday entertainment.

Writer-director Malcolm D. Lee has his own brand of dry twig in ""The Best Man Holiday"" with his cast constantly walking in on exactly the wrong part of an overheard conversation misreading something on someone elses phone or tablet or eavesdropping when they shouldnt. The tally of significant coincidences and half-heard scraps of information on display here would exhaust even the snoopy staff of Downton Abbey. Still as its title suggests ""The Best Man Holiday"" is a Christmas movie the genre of film most likely to bypass critical faculties and nestle comfortably in our sentimentality zone. For some audiences its mix of holiday cheer and pathos will make it a go-to movie in Decembers to come but I found it to be a disappointing sequel to its charming-enough predecessor 1999s ""The Best Man."" See video Mariah Carey Jimmy Fallon The Roots and Kids Perform All I Want for Christmas Is You The opening credits do a tidy job of bringing newbies up to speed theres novelist Harper (Taye Diggs) who has yet to publish a follow-up to his best-selling roman-a-clef about his college years; his chef wife Robyn (Sanaa Lathan) in the final stages of a pregnancy that both of them have long wanted; Harpers close platonic pal Jordan (Nia Long) now a programming hot-shot at MSNBC with a preppy white boyfriend (Eddie Cibrian) who loves her ""Olivia Pope vibe""; rakish Quentin (Terrence Howard) after years of job-hopping has come into real money as a ""brand manager""; Julian (Harold Perrineau) runs a tony private school with his ex-stripper wife Candy (Regina Hall); and Julians shrewish ex Shelby (Melissa De Sousa) has found the perfect place for her sense of drama and self-aggrandizement as one of the ""Real Housewives of Westchester."" This whole gaggle gets an invitation to spend Christmas with soon-to-retire pro footballer Lance (Morris Chestnut) and his wife Mia (Monica Calhoun); Lance is still wary of former BFF Harper because of Harpers one-night stand with Mia in college (and over Harper having included it in his novel). But Mia insists that all of their closest friends gather at their sprawling home for the Yuletide. Also read Delivery Man Review An Excessively Artificial Insemination Comedy And if youve watched enough Christmas movies -- and Ive seen my share -- you know that impromptu holiday gatherings of friends and/or family means someone is terminally ill. (This is also one of those December-set movies where it clearly wasnt cold during shooting -- at some point theres a reference to someone slipping on ice even though all the lawns are still green.) ""The Best Man Holiday"" keeps lobbing plot twists at us -- Can Julian keep the school open after a major donor learns of Candys past? Will Harper desperately attempt to save his writing career by exploiting his relationship with Lance and offering to ghost-write Lances memoir? -- but the movie works best when these talented actors get to just banter and goof on each other the way old friends do. In both ""Best Man"" movies Lee shoehorns in conversations about Jesus without much grace but even the characters he treats like role models have no place being so didactic. Lance for example is constantly held up as this paragon of godly behavior but he keeps stewing over Harper and Mias indiscretion all these years later. One subplot revolves around whether or not Lance will break the NFL rushing record but hes already a world-class grudge carrier. Also read Baggage Claim Review Woefully Outdated Look at the Challenges of Finding True Love Lee also never seems to notice that the women in both movies are held to a much higher standard over their past behavior than the men are. This isnt presented as a failing of the male characters; its just something that the male writer-director does without apparently realizing it. The ending (which involves among other things a layman delivering a baby thats in the breech position -- dont try this at home) couldnt be more contrived but again its a Christmas movie and we all have our favorite flavors of seasonal schmaltz. The kind that ""The Best Man Holiday"" serves up was for me at least too hard to swallow. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Lee returns to the same well with lesser results in this cluttered overlong sequel to 1999s The Best Man. Back in 1999 Malcolm D. Lees debut feature ""The Best Man"" had all the hallmarks of a low-key groundbreaker Smart sophisticated and effortlessly charming the film was a sleeper success at the B.O. and seemed to point toward a lucrative future for cosmopolitan romantic comedies featuring actors of color. Fourteen years later its disappointing to note just how few features seem to have followed in its footsteps and almost as discouraging to see Lee return to the same well with such disjointed results in ""The Best Man Holiday."" The returning ensemble cast remains eminently watchable here and should help position the Universal release as a profitable counterprogrammer but the cluttered overlong narrative never really finds its footing.This story first appeared in the November 19 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. Wagering that fans of the original remember its sizable cast of characters with a level of recall most commonly seen in Marvel fanboys the film offers only a few remedial clips from ""The Best Man"" over the opening credits as well as some lightning-fast catch-up. We learn that protagonist and onetime best man Harper (Taye Diggs) topped the bestseller list with his semi-autobiographical novel while his now-pregnant wife Robyn (Sanaa Lathan) is a superstar chef. Harpers estranged best friend Lance (Morris Chestnut) is nearing the end of his final season as a running back for the New York Giants poised to break the all-time career rushing record while his wife (Monica Calhoun) and four angelic children gaze on beatifically. Julian (Harold Perrineau) and his former-stripper wife Candace (Regina Hall) run a luxe private school; bachelor-stoner Quentin (Terrence Howard) helms a branding agency; and platinum-haired harridan Shelby (Melissa De Sousa) has found her calling as a reality TV reprobate on a ""Real Housewives"" spinoff. Meanwhile Jordan (Nia Long) is now a high-powered TV producer dating a studly white lawyer (Eddie Cibrian) to the shock and titillation of her old friends who have apparently never encountered an interracial relationship in all their years among the New York media elite. This motley group of former college buddies lovers and antagonists gather to spend Christmas weekend at Lances gargantuan country estate the first time theyve been reunited since Lances wedding 14 years earlier. A wealth of old jealousies and hostilities remain waiting to be unearthed complicated by the fact that Harper suffering from writers block and money woes hes kept secret from his wife has agreed to write an unauthorized biography of his famous host. Lees screenplay contains a number of winning lines and hes admirably willing to tackle some tough issues but he never settles on an appropriate tone. For much of the first hour the filmmaker orchestrates an ungainly polyphony of fast-moving hijinks smutty dinner-party conversations inopportune entrances cell-phone mix-ups attempted husband snatches and blackmail with mounting conflicts periodically interrupted by abrupt cuts to sexytime montages and weirdly well-rehearsed New Edition dance routines. Roughly halfway through the two-hour-plus running time one character reveals a tragic secret and the film switches gears on a dime filling the second half with tearful fights reconciliations Christmas miracles and chest-beating religious invocations. The original ""Best Man"" juggled most of these disparate elements and tones too but it managed to do so far more organically in a way that made sense for a group of twentysomethings still finding their way in the adult world. To see these characters indulging in the same catty asides and childish histrionics while pushing 40 begins to strain audience sympathy particularly when there are a number of genuinely affecting grace notes and plot threads buried within all the noise. Most notably the central relationship between Harper and Lance is sensitively sketched delineating the complicated ways that adult male friendships can seesaw between resentment and vulnerability and Harpers increasing desperation to keep up appearances in the face of financial hardship strikes a painfully realistic chord. Yet Lee surrounds this solid foundation with far too many contrived subplots for it to resonate as deeply as it should. His affection for these characters is obvious and while hes nothing if not democratic in his allocation of redemptive arcs to each and every actor onscreen a good deal of clear-eyed pruning would have done a world of good. Which is not to say that the supporting ensemble doesnt do its part; in fact without such an overstocked bench things could have become a real mess. Howard clearly relishes the chance to reprise his scene-stealing breakout role; De Sousa provides some outrageously hissable villainy; and Long is so sharp and luminous in what should be a tiresome role as a commitment-phobic career woman that one cant help but mourn the number of such parts that have routinely gone to Katherine Heigl instead. Production design lays on the luxury signifiers with a trowel - these characters were always bourgeois but now their lifestyles seem only a few steps removed from Saudi royalty - but otherwise the film is professionally shot and assembled with an ace soundtrack full of soulful yuletide tunes.

Michael W says November 21 2013 at 1135 pm I must respectfully disagree with you assessment of the film. I thought it was wonderfully crafted and the acting was superb. I thought it achieved an amazing balance of comedy and very heavy drama and seemlessly flowed from one to the other. I admit there were some formulaic and occasionally contrived moments but the were few and wholly forgivable when measured next to all the great positives ofbthe film. I actually saw it twice during the opening weekend and am tempted to see it again. I really was that good to me. AWESOME film. A must see Reply ted says November 18 2013 at 127 pm I agree with everyone but I wouldnt spend money to see it. I am just getting so sick of all the racial business today it seems to sap the life out of everything. Reply c.velez-powell says November 17 2013 at 1121 pm Was a wonderful movie black white green blue people would not have mattered. Best movie I have seen all year compared to movies about ghosts werewolves and the same old stuff remade from the 80s movies what a breath of fresh air to see something that is real and deals with real life stuff that people deal with everyday Reply Star Briscoe says November 17 2013 at 954 am The characters are not surprised at inter racial dating. Its within their circle with a friend that has not dated much and when she does hes white. Not unlike the side glances stares and whispers that we have had to endure when dating someone outside our race and we meet their friends particularly when it is uncommon for that individual to do so. Lets not try so hardito sound enlightened that you sound unrealistic Reply TAI says November 17 2013 at 903 am THIS MOVIE WAS AMAZING SAD YOU DIDNT SEE THAT. IT WAS HEART FELT AND HE DID A GREAT JOB AT CIRCLING ALL THESE CHARACTERS TOGETHER WITHOUT TOO MUCH PREDICTABILITY. SOMEONE SOUNDS RACIST TO ME AND ITS THIS CRITIC. ""ACTORS OF COLOR"" .. YES THEY ALL ROCKED AND THE BOX OFFICE NUMBERS WILL HELP TO DISCREDIT YOU. ENJOY YOURSELF AND GET A NEW CAREER Reply Terri-Ann says November 17 2013 at 610 am The movie was fantastic and all the fans like me are going to make all you negative reviewers eat your words Just wait and see how successful this movie will be. Im going to see it again this weekend by the way. Absolutely wonderful movie Best movie Ive seen all year Reply Yolanda says November 16 2013 at 536 pm I love the movie it was great........... Reply melanie says November 16 2013 at 438 am Catherine it was great..as an AA woman i usually ignore critics like this. Im sick of people saying this is a black film that only blacks will see and support. Both movies were about love friendship faith and family. I wonder if he would have shredded an all white cast. Which by the way if it was the movie would have been classified as a romantic comedy or dramedy. These types of reviews are what hinder AA and people in film. I see movies with all white casts all the time with no regard for color at all just the story. movies/music with all people of color (black hispanic asian etc) dont get that unconditional support unless it involves violence mysogyny or buffonery. So who really has issues? Reply sally says November 15 2013 at 914 am Well said Catherine Reply Joi says November 16 2013 at 738 am Catherine I couldnt agree more. Reply Catherine says November 13 2013 at 1129 am meant to say academic hyper-critical criticism is standard for any film.... Reply Catherine says November 13 2013 at 1127 am Methinks youre overthinking things. This academic hyper-critical is standard for any film but there is something to be said for the value of entertainment good actors and fans who just want to enjoy a ride. Im not African-American - and happened to catch the first film on TV a few months ago ahd loved it. Im just excited to see the next chapter. I have a feeling I will enjoy the hell out of it. Thats good enough for me.

Malcolm D. Lees ""The Best Man Holiday"" picks up fifteen years after the fistfight-filled wedding that served as both setting and reason for his first film and while everyone has moved on with their lives some people are still emotionally mired in the past. This is absolutely a good reason to gather ten people in a house together to celebrate the holidays. Nothing can possibly go wrong. When is the Yankee Swap taking place? Here to help audiences along with remembering just what went down in the first film - fine well bite Harper Stewart (Taye Diggs) wrote a book about his friends college years and the secrets revealed within it came to light during his best pal Lances (Morris Chestnut) wedding thats as far as well go - is a zippy opening montage. Packed with footage new and old fake news clippings and handy name tags the opening credits are both strangely ambitious (it clearly took some time to put together) and utterly confusing to neophytes. Informative opening credits aside audiences will pick the rest up quite easily along the way thanks to helpful (it not entirely hammy) exposition and enough in fighting to make it plain just who hates who (even if its not always exactly clear why). Friendships that were already tested in Lees first film havent necessarily healed so when the Stewarts (Diggs and Sanaa Lathan as his very pregnant wife Robyn) are asked to attend a long weekend of holiday festivities at the Sullivan home (the now long-married Chestnut and Monica Calhoun as a lovely wife Mia) its certainly jarring and a bit strange. Their presence has been requested via the most vague invite imaginable - the Sullivans card references only ""this holiday season"" and their desired attendance without any details whatsoever. No wonder they dont want to go. Yet as soon as they arrive at the Sullivans McMansion (presumably on time and on the correct day) they are greeted with printed out itineraries that detail the next three days. Relaxing right? Well it sort of is if only because Mia is so beatific and charming as a hostess and never lets them feel as if something else is going on (read something else is going on). Perhaps its because Harper is so caught up in his own personal games that he doesnt pick up on the inherent weirdness of the situation sooner. Author Harper hasnt had a hit in years and his agent (played weirdly and wonderfully by John Michael Higgins as a man prone to yelling about Twitter without sounding deranged) has suggested that Harper charm ex-bestie Lance in order to pen the soon-to-be-retiring football heros memoirs. Too bad for Harper that Lance still hates him and the arrival of the rest of their pals will only stir up more drama to spare. ""The Best Man Holiday"" is a film about relationships and people - so there are plenty of relationships and people to move around inside it and confusing introduction aside Lee does a good job keeping everyone and everything (mostly) straight once theyre all under one roof. Robyn is still struggling with Harpers old feelings for Jordan (Nia Long) who is also struggling with her own feelings about her nice new boyfriend Brian (Eddie Cibrian). Elsewhere Julian (Harold Perrineau) is dealing with the business repercussions of a YouTube video of his ex-stripper wife Candace (Regina Hall) who is none the wiser to the troubles her husband is facing. Rounding it all out are Shelby (Melissa De Sousa) a drama queen who has finally found a fitting home on ""The Real Housewives of Westchester"" and Terrence Howard as dippy sexy Quentin turning in one of the most off-the-wall and engaging performances of the year. Its an explosive combination of personalities secrets and pure insanity. How insane? Lets put it this way - ""The Best Man"" holiday includes a sex montage that features all the different characters engaging in various acts all set to Christmas music. Happy holidays folks hope you brought your families. That sort of thing speaks to the tone of the film which is to say one that is all over the cinematic map - vacillating wildly between the pure cornball (platitudes about faith and family) to the outrageously wacky (Terrence Howard sending dick pics). ""The Best Man Holiday"" crams wild hijinks and crazy catfights alongside deeper mediations about the presence of God in our lives and the true meaning of friendship without batting a damn eye making the film both bonkers crazy and totally engaging to watch. Yet for all its tonal missteps and traditional tropes ""The Best Man Holiday"" has something rare at its very center - genuine emotion. Once the real reasons for Mias burning desire to reunite all her friends for one last Christmas come to light its a race to see who can sob and wail the hardest and longest but all that emotion the stuff that could so easily feel forced and over the top scans as believable here. By its last act ""The Best Man Holiday"" goes whole hog on the holiday cheese and theres something admirable about an adult feature that doesnt balk at real feelings especially around the holidays (sex montages notwithstanding).

Harper (Taye Diggs) meanwhile is still struggling to equal the success of his first novel and his wife Robin (Sanaa Lathan) is near term after a series of miscarriages. Christmas as it is wont to do brings everybody back together. Theres something strangely subversive to this awkwardly titled sequel as if writer-director Malcolm D. Lee is trying to stake an African-American claim on every dumb melodramatic cliche in a single movie. That thing where friends get together after years apart and long-buried tensions rise to the surface? Thats ours now. The bit where incriminating documents spill out of an upended bag? Dont care if it doesnt make sense in the iPad era--were using it anyway. Lee manages the cross currents of their many relationships more artfully than the first time out but the more profound change is how much his actors and his skills in managing them have grown. The scripts sporadic silliness makes every plot turn questionable; how the talent deftly negotiates such goofiness makes the film near-impossible to resist.

Pictures like Love Jones Brown Sugar How Stella Got Her Groove Back and Something New provided a showcase for actors of color a refreshing change from the usual practice of airlifting the occasional black actor -- wisecracking sidekick alert -- into an otherwise all-white-people action movie or thriller. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Even though those movies werent always romantic comedies in the strictest sense they were still more appealing than most of the ""white"" romantic comedies of the day. Instead of giving us Meg Ryan or Kate Hudson desperately trying to appear average and pathetic the ""black"" comedies were populated by attractive people wearing beautiful clothes and leading interesting complicated lives. These comedies of manners were bold and vibrant and like the romantic comedies of the 30s they werent afraid of aspirational glamour. Why settle for the sad vision of Sandra Bullock in a baggy sweater sniffling into a tissue when you could be watching Nia Long stride into the sleek corner office -- one that shed earned -- wearing a drapey silk pantsuit?And then even though they made good money and filled a crucial niche these movies disappeared almost as mysteriously as they had arrived -- strangely enough just before we got it together to elect our first black president -- leaving the field wide open for Tyler Perrys broader brand of humor and Madeas even broader bosom. And so its only now that were getting a sequel to one of the most exuberant and astute black ensemble comedies Malcolm D. Lees 1999 The Best Man.Film DetailsCritics Pick The Best Man Holiday RatingR GenreComedy Running Time122 More Info The Best Man Holiday picks up 14 years after The Best Man left off and an early montage gets newcomers quickly up to speed on the four male characters introduced the first time around as well as their significant others exes or would-be exes. Harper the once-successful author played by Taye Diggs has fallen on hard times Writers block has hit him hard. His agent (a wily John Michael Higgins) trying to coax another hot book out of him explains bluntly why the first was such a success ""It was funny sexy smart."" Then comes the killer kicker ""And not just black-people smart.""It doesnt help that Harper and his wife (Sanaa Lathan) are expecting their first child after a long fertility struggle. Plus its Christmas time and theyve been invited to spend a holiday weekend with his former best friend upstanding pro football player Lance (Morris Chestnut) his sweet self-sacrificing wife (Monica Calhoun) and their four -- count em -- beautiful and well-behaved children. Diggss and Chestnuts characters have had something of a falling out -- if you saw The Best Man you know why -- but their other pals also invited for this weekend of revelry and revelations have problems of their own Long Harold Perrineau Regina Hall Melissa De Sousa and the irrepressible Terrence Howard all reprise the roles they played in the earlier film. And miraculously most of them look as if only two or three years have passed rather than 14.If you havent seen The Best Man you may well be thinking Is this a movie or a soap opera? Actually unapologetically its a little of both. Lee -- who again wrote the script -- throws in everything he can grablove sex money jealousy interracial romance mortal illness childbirth; theres even a dance number. Lee cant quite juggle it all and the picture drags a bit through its last third. All that free-floating melodrama even tempered by the occasional well-placed zinger takes its toll.Then again maybe Lee -- cousin of Spike incidentally -- is just making up for lost time. A lot can happen in 14 years but what hasnt changed is Lees tendency toward inclusiveness. (He recently made an entry in the past-its-sell-by-date Scary Movie franchise but he also directed the sly marvelous 2002 blaxploitation spoof Undercover Brother.) The Best Man Holiday isnt a piece of social realism. And yet like the dazzling canny comedy of Key and Peele it acknowledges that its futile to speak of a single black experience; at this point in America were all a mess of experiences. When the guys in The Best Man Holiday break away from the women for a turn at the pool table they segue into a debate about which girlfriend or wife past or present has proved best at ""rocking the mic."" (Theyre not talking about karaoke.) The women left on their own are actually bawdier.Weve seen this kind of thing thousands of times before with white characters as well as black ones which is probably the point. Lee seems less interested in capturing how people of color talk than in capturing how people talk. He coaxes us to step in and listen and the very casualness of his invitation is the key to the joyousness of The Best Man Holiday flaws be damned. In one of the finest sequences the men rib Longs boyfriend a white guy (Eddie Cibrian) only to recognize that hes extremely good to and for her. They posture as big men and he shames them a little with his lack of judgment about Longs romantic or sexual past. Theyve caught themselves being stereotypes and its all good because who isnt a stereotype? But really theyd rather be better men. Maybe were getting that much closer to being one nation under a groove.Follow VoiceFilmClub Subscribe to the Voice Film Club podcast Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Stephanie Zacharek Follow szacharek Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.
