The maternal/filial bond however has recently been weakened by competitiveness Max determined to show shes not too old for the game Page intent on proving herself as capable as mom. And while repellent billionaire William B Tensy (Hackman) is almost too much to handle its a previous victim the inescapable Dean (Liotta) and a cute bartender Jack (Lee) who cause the real problems. The film lacks funny jokes. But if youre interested in the blossoming of Love Hewitt therell be no refunds. Admittedly shes playing a young woman who uses her sexuality overtly to seduce men but such slavish attention to looks obscures the acting. Not offensively bad but silly.

See Heartbreakers In this story Two dames on the make Off to Florida The family that scams together ... RELATED SITES By Paul ClintonCNN Reviewer (CNN) -- Movies milking laughter out of the nefarious exploits of grifters and con artists has long been a popular Hollywood formula. Michael Caine and Steve Martin teamed as a couple of guys on the take -- with hilarious results -- in ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"" (1988). Robert Redford and Paul Newman added plenty of comic undertones to the dramatic tension of ""The Sting"" (1973) and Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis scammed their way to safety -- in drag no less -- in ""Some Like It Hot"" (1959). And thats just a few. ""Heartbreakers"" continues that time-honored tradition. With a cast including Sigourney Weaver Jennifer Love Hewitt Gene Hackman Ray Liotta and Jason Lee there is no shortage of talent in this comedy. Add director David Mirkin (""Romy and Micheles High School Reunion"" 1997) throw in a sharply worded script by Robert Dunn Paul Guay and Stephen Mazur and you have film that is clever witty and fast-paced -- even if the plots structure does get absurd at times. However since this film is a farce absurdity is allowed ... to a point anyway. Two dames on the make Weaver and Hewitt play mother and daughter and its a good match. Exceptionally attractive women the two appear as if they may have been swimming in the same gene pool. In some scenes they are so barely covered that you could make an argument to give their chests star billing too. Mother and daughter have devised a con that is as brilliant as they are lovely. Weaver playing Mama Max finds the mark and marries him. Then Hewitt as Page Maxs dutiful daughter (wearing skin-tight skimpy outfits that would rival anything is Jennifer Lopezs closet) enters the picture disguised as a secretary maid - whatever -- and seduces said mark. Mama catches them in the act. Horrors Divorce follows. Big settlement ka-ching Next victim please. The films credits open with one of these scams in progress. Ray Liotta as Dean Cummano is a low-level New Jersey hood who runs a chop shop for stolen cars. Hes fallen under Maxs spell and we meet them at their wedding. But when it comes time to consummate the union Max feigns sleep. Dean goes to his office to clean up some paperwork before the honeymoon. Waiting for him is Page whos posing as a temporary secretary and the sexual sitting duck hasnt a chance.

"USATODAY.com - Heartbreakers falls apart Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 04/02/2001 - Updated 1220 PM ET Heartbreakers falls apart By Susan Wloszczyna USA TODAY Heartbreakers out of four Stars Sigourney Weaver Jennifer Love Hewitt Ray Liotta Gene Hackman Director David Mirkin Distributor MGM Rating PG-13 for sex-related content including dialogue Heartbreakers is the perfect bonding experience for fathers and sons. The nasty overlong and undisciplined sourball of a sex farce about a mother-daughter con team will nonetheless satisfy bigenerational libidinous fantasies. Dad gets to ogle 51-year-old Sigourney Weaver stuffed into her gowns as if they were spandex sausage casings a tantalizing sight for bifocal-wearing eyes. Junior will have a chance to revel in the bountiful charms of 22-year-old Jennifer Love Hewitt. Like a Love-struck schoolboy the camera cant stop staring at her ample bosom her rounded rear her shapely legs. Acting-wise well lets just say if they gave Oscars for best calves shed have Julia Roberts beat. These familial fleecers put the glam in scam as they dupe yet another hot-to-trot wallet-heavy sucker. Initially its Ray Liottas New Jersey chop-shop owner. Weaver weds him but before she has to bed him she dispatches her fetching daughter posing as a secretary to bait the patsy into nearly committing an act of infidelity. Lawyers are called money is paid and theyre off to their next bilking job. That would be in Palm Beach Fla. where the pair fishes for rich bachelors. Weaver zones in on Gene Hackmans phlegm-spewing tobacco tycoon who is so nicotine-stained his entire epidermis is an unsavory brown save for a red beacon of a nose. Imagine a toasted W.C. Fields. Meanwhile Hewitt yearns to commit a solo gold-dig gig and seizes upon a stargazing beach-bar owner (Jason Lee as befuddled about what his character is supposed to be as we are). But she commits a no-no She falls for him. Weaver can do ruthless in her sleep (and does) and Hewitt convinces as a cynical tease. The way they stomp about in tandem spike heels gagging at the thought of paying for gas or a hotel room is a neat sendup of human behavior in expense-accounted times. But at some point after the material gals compete to see who can first trap a bar patron into buying them a drink but before Weaver falls into a silly Russian accent its clear we the audience are the fools. We were expecting a comedy as well-built as Hewitts body. There are occasional zingers. Liotta proves to be a welcome source of riotous raunch -- Ive never heard the phrase ""soil sample"" used in a sexual context. But for a dark-humored lark to truly work it must be carefully constructed and perfectly wound. Director David Mirkin whose Romy and Micheles High School Reunion was similarly afflicted never gets the timing right and allows the story to drag with little internal logic. Even the tricks Weaver and Hewitt pull to escape their bills (pouring shards of glass on restaurant plates pretending to trip in a hotel lobby) arent inspired or believable. Instead of rooting for the seductive swindlers I kept wishing that Hackman whose exit is undeservedly cruel would somehow return. But just like Hewitts neckline Heartbreakers would rather plunge to new lows.

Handout Photo Sigourney Weaver right and Jennifer Love Hewitt play a mother-and-daughter con team in ""Heartbreakers."" Handout Photo Cardiac Arrest / Heartbreakers needs surgery 1 / 1 Back to Gallery HEARTBREAKERS Comedy. Starring Sigourney Weaver Jennifer Love Hewitt Ray Liotta Jason Lee and Gene Hackman. Directed by David Mirkin. Written by Robert Dunn Paul Guay and Stephen Mazur. (PG-13. 123 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Bewitched blitzed and bamboozled men tend to make fools of themselves around Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt. Marriage is proposed bank accounts emptied common sense left in the gutter. Theres a great idea at the core of ""Heartbreakers"" which stars Weaver and Hewitt as a mother-daughter con team with a gift for fleecing the rich and deluded. But director David Mirkin who made ""Romy and Michelles High School Reunion"" lacks the kind of rhythm and snap to make it work -- and allows this fitfully entertaining romp to dribble on way too long. ""Heartbreakers"" runs 123 minutes but it drops dead at the 90-minute mark when a wheezy old tycoon played by Gene Hackman falls on the erect penis of a plaster statue and croaks. With Hackman gone the energy just evaporates and the stuff that follows -- twists turns whos-zooming-whom? surprises -- grows tedious. Its time for directors of lightweight comedy to sign an ironclad pact No one with only the rarest of exceptions should be allowed to make a film longer than 95 minutes. Running any longer makes no sense and the movies that do usually smell of self-indulgence and poor writing. ""Heartbreakers"" has great costumes (short skirts nose-bleed heels va-voom push-up bras) a smattering of zingy lines and several moments that suggest where Mirkin might have gone with tighter focus and a better script. (The screenplay is credited to three writers -- always a bad sign.) Mirkin and his writers obviously were inspired by Preston Sturges who made the screwball classic ""The Lady Eve"" (1941) with Barbara Stanwyck and Charles Coburn as daughter-father bunko artists and Henry Fonda as their stooge. Id also wager that Mirkin spent a few evenings running Ernst Lubitschs ""Trouble in Paradise"" (husband-wife jewel thieves) and Stephen Frears ""The Grifters"" (mother-and-son swindlers). What those movies had that ""Heartbreakers"" lacks is the brilliance of economy. They also had impeccable acting which Weaver and Hackman deliver but which Hewitt whatever her merits cant provide. Playing her first adult role after a TV teen-queen career Hewitt remains fixed in an acting rut Instead of purring with confidence and layering her performance with a femme fatales multiplicity of faces and attitudes she comes off like an adolescent vixen (""Like duh"") in an Aaron Spelling soap. I would have loved seeing Reese Witherspoon or Kirsten Dunst in this role. Hewitt poor thing shows her claws in every scene so much so that when an easygoing Florida bartender (Jason Lee) falls for her and tells her he senses the sweetness beneath the facade it makes no sense. Theres nothing in the movie to support his observation and nothing to make us feel warm inside as were meant to when this crooked little scammer goes straight. Unless youre a Hackman aficionado theres no reason to bother with ""Heartbreakers."" Playing William B. Teensy a grumpy leering chain-smoking Palm Beach billionaire Hackmans a wonder He looks like hell works an amazing variety of looks from those rummy heavy-lidded eyes (think W.C. Fields without the accent) and adds a blast of zest to a mediocre movie. Is there anything this actor cant play? Any boundary to his resourcefulness and good humor? None that I can see. . This movie contains sexual situations and raw language.

(Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer) Max (Sigourney Weaver) and her daughter Page (Jennifer Love Hewitt) are a scamming team. Max tricks rich men into marriage Page seduces them into infidelity then Max picks them clean in divorce court. But when they decide to do their last scam together -- on hacking coughing tobacco billionaire William B. Tensy (Gene Hackman) -- romantic complications follow. For Max theres Dean (Ray Liotta) a husband and chop-shop owner from New Jersey who still loves Max even after she has divorced him and taken his money. And when Page tries to branch off on her own she falls in love with her target nice guy Jack (Jason Lee). The performers give this mediocre comedy more energy than it deserves. But Pages affair with Jack in which she spends almost two hours of the movie in denial about her feelings is too tedious for anyone to sit through. And the subplots -- Maxs dealings with Tensy and Dean -- are even worse. Trust me youll want to leave these people to get on with their tedious scams alone.

Tall and imperial Max (Sigourney Weaver) a mistress of disguise will manipulate a hormone-driven sap like the New Jersey chop-shop entrepreneur Dean Cumanno (Ray Liotta) into marrying her in no small part by withholding bedroom favors. The moment the knot gets tied Page (Jennifer Love Hewitt) a fresh-faced sex bunny shows up to seduce the new groom out of his pants and his wedding vows. A speedy and lucrative divorce settlement inevitably follows. This vicious feminine hustle sounds like a canny arrangement and so its appropriate that the two actresses are nothing if not fetching in their vengeful-minx glee. Weaver by now has taken on these sorts of aristocratic-bitch roles once too often but the light of her comic contempt remains undiminished. In Heartbreakers shes at her best when Max pretending to be some sort of Russian temptress is wooing the grotesque walking-corpse cigarette tycoon William B. Tensy (Gene Hackman) whose hacking cough could rattle the plaster off walls. Weaver makes herself as old-world ""romantic"" as Anna Karenina but she also performs a triumphant balalaika-band version of ""Back in the USSR."" The perky Love Hewitt is a more limited actress but her live-party-doll look all sharp teenybop angles set off by that voluptuous bosom (strutting her bod in skin-tight minidresses and platform heels she looks ready to take on the role of Playboys Little Annie Fanny) has never been put to better use. That said Heartbreakers is at best a half-hearted mercenary farce. Game as the actresses are you can feel the movie slipping into the wrong gear the moment that Page starts to bicker with her mother about how shes old enough to go out on her own. This coming-of-age conflict belongs in a different movie and it dilutes what should have been a far trickier series of schemes and deceptions. Jason Lee looking as scrubbed here as he did rock-god sleazy in Almost Famous shows up as a laid-back beach-bar owner who falls in love with Page unaware that shes trying to bilk him out of the 3 million hes been offered for his property. Lee as an actor is a slacker Jekyll and Hyde -- he can play wistful innocents as convincingly as he does raffish jerks -- but his courting scenes with Love Hewitt are bereft of comic tension. You just want to see these two kids get together. It has been over half a century since Kind Hearts and Coronets gave us a British cad blithely killing off his extended family. In 1988 the hit-or-miss Dirty Rotten Scoundrels generated a few mean laughs. By now though the culture at large has grown avaricious enough to have rendered this sort of movie all but obsolete. Heartbreakers never tickles your nasty bone perhaps because in an era when the gossip pages are dotted with news of celebrity prenups the prospect of marriage as a route to instant fortune seems less scandalous than it does like business as usual.

B.O. haul looks to be moderate. The dirty rotten scoundrels are mother-daughter babes in ""Heartbreakers"" but the concept of a glamorous tag team fleecing unsuspecting men overstays its welcome by at least a half-hour after never getting very high off the ground in the first place. Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt make the gold-digging duo attractive but not the least bit sympathetic resulting in a picture to be watched for its plot mechanics and very occasional laughs rather than with any engagement in its characters or the stakes involved. B.O. haul looks to be moderate. With a deep bow to Preston Sturges ""The Lady Eve"" certainly the class of all female con artist pictures ""Heartbreakers"" is scarcely oblivious to other genre antecedents. As he did in his first feature outing ""Romy and Micheles High School Reunion"" director David Mirkin supplies a certain gaudy energy to a just OK script but the dialogue offers only intermittent zingers and the fundamentally unsavory tenor of the story isnt ultimately offset by comically successful stylization. Long opening sequence illustrates the modus operandi of Max (Weaver) and Page (Hewitt) hardcase mother and cynical sprig respectively who have made a career of their deceitful tricks. Newly married to chop shop operator Dean Cumanno (Ray Liotta) Max teases him with exceptional sexual promises before passing out on their wedding night bed. Next morning she repeats how much she wants him only to race off to barf before any hanky-panky can take place. Horny as hell when he visits his office Dean simply cannot resist the charms of his busty secretary (Hewitt) and just when shes got him in a compromising position Max bursts in to witness her brand new husbands infidelity thereby prompting a tidy cash settlement. Still in need of a major monetary score however the women move on to Palm Beach and take a scenic boat tour of the mansions and their owners in search of a target. Their choice is William B. Tensy (Gene Hackman) a tobacco tycoon who would be far richer still if everyone else smoked as much as he does (when a woman asks him to put out his cigarette he mutters ""Nazi""). Rightly sensing an easy mark in this aging bachelor with a red nose and the worst hair this side of Larry of the Three Stooges Max puts on a full court press posing as a Russian and quickly inducing Tensy to propose. Farcical tragedy intervenes however so the onus is now on Page who has been busy falling in love to the best of her curdled abilities with beachfront barman Jack (Jason Lee). Finding out that the sweet good-natured fellow is actually worth well into seven figures makes the task all the easier for Page who reluctantly joins Mom and the newly reappeared Dean in a plot to fleece Jack. Given the gleeful self-deprecation with which he seizes the role of the bamboozled billionaire its too bad Hackman wasnt given more angles to play and that he disappears from the action as soon as he does. Much more fun might have ensued had his wheezing geezer grasped the con and attempted a counterattack; this might also have eliminated the need for some laborious business concerning corpse disposal and a statue in need of a penis implant. As it is the seriously extended final reels are mostly devoted to the flinty Page trying to figure out whether she really loves Jack and to an unconvincing effort by Mirkin and scripters Robert Dunn Paul Guay and Stephen Mazur to inject a little heart and humanity into a tale about ruthless connivers. Looking like the billion bucks Max feels should be hers Weaver puts a good sultry/comic spin on her calculating character. Given that Hewitts performance is dominated by petulant stances and impatient eye-rolling her contribution here is mostly decorative as not a chance is missed to emphasize her cleavage and legs. On the supporting side Liotta is vigorously vulgar Lee is blissful and Nora Dunn has a choice moment or two as Tensys stern housekeeper. Lilly Kilverts splashy intentionally loud production design and Gary Jones costume designs abetted by those of Ann Roth for Weaver enliven the protracted proceedings while the repetitive nature of John Debneys score which is often used like a cymbal crash to key scene-ending laughs becomes annoying. And hasnt it been common knowledge forever that comedies are with rare exceptions best kept short? Apparently even the best known lessons have to be forgotten and relearned at the viewers expense.
