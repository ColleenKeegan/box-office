Pretty but unpopular Kate (Brittany Snow) is enlisted to help three party girls get even with John Tucker whos been dating them all. Kate must be trained in the ways of popular flirty girls in order to catch Tuckers eye so she can then break his heart. Quite why Kate agrees is never clear although the benefits for the young female viewer are obvious (Tucker is Desperate Housewives heartthrob Jesse Metcalfe). And so the wish-fulfilment storyline plods on evenly enough with the odd laugh here and there. Theres precious little for older audiences none of the bite of Mean Girls and the transparent plotting and gender stereotyping annoy. John Tucker... is not the worst of its kind but few over the age of 14 will find it worth forking out for.

"John Tucker Must Die | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; john-tucker-must-die ) John Tucker Must Die (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli The gulf is vast between what the studio wants us to think John Tucker Must Die is and what it really is. The marketers and publicists would have us believe this is a dark edgy teen comedy about a band of two-timed girls taking revenge on the schools biggest hunk. Unfortunately Betty Thomas film is neither dark nor edgy (although it occasionally tries masquerading in those categories) nor is it particularly funny. (Anything close to amusing can be found in the two-minute trailer.) Predictable and familiar it feels during its best moments like the neutered offspring of Mean Girls and Cant Buy Me Love. But any goodwill the film builds up during its first 80 minutes evaporates in the last ten when it resorts to moralizing and universal redemption. I know this is supposed to be a fantasy but when I was in high school my dreams never came complete with sermons. John Tucker (Jesse Metcalf) is the most popular guy in school - as the saying goes every girl wants him and every boy wants to be him. Hes a cross between a model and a Greek god but John is about to learn the truth of the proverb that hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. When Johns three latest conquests - cheerleader Heather (Ashanti) animal rights activist Beth (Sophia Bush) and honors student Carrie (Arielle Kebbel) - learn that each of them is not his one and only they vow revenge. Their plan make him fall in love then dump him. To help they enlist the schools most unpopular girl Kate (Brittany Snow) as his fake love connection. After remaking her into the perfect bait for John they unleash him on the sports superstar. The results are pretty much what youd expect John starts seeing Kate as more than another notch in his belt and Kate starts seeing John as more than an object of female vengeance. I love movies in which 26-year-olds and 28-year-olds pretend theyre still in high school. Who do they think theyre fooling? In recent years Hollywood has gotten away from that trend casting performers who are close to the ages of their characters but it makes a comeback in John Tucker Must Die. (Although these actors dont approach the absurdities of Grease where 34-year-old Stockard Channing and 30-year-old Olivia Newton-John played teens.) The film also perpetuates the ""ugly duckling"" conceit the character intended to be the least appealing is actually the most attractive. This is the case with Brittany Snows Kate. No matter how far youre willing to go in your suspension of disbelief its tough to accept that Kate never gets asked out on dates. Anyone who has followed Betty Thomas career knows to approach John Tucker Must Die with skepticism. Thomas had couple of minor hits in the mid-1990s (Private Parts and The Brady Bunch Movie) but her resume is dominated by titles likely to make the average movie-goer wince. Dr. Dolittle. I Spy. 28 Days. John Tucker Must Die fits in with those uninspired titles and thats not company any self-respecting motion picture with box office aspirations wants to keep. The performances mainly by second-tier actors trying to make the leap from television to movies are perfunctory across-the-board. No one stands out as being especially good or bad and as most people will acknowledge nothing is more boring than mediocrity. The one surprise comes from Jenny McCarthy the ex-Playmate who has a small part as Kates mom. Although it was apparently written into her contract that someone has to comment how ""hot"" she is every time she exits a scene McCarthy has never looked worse. Shes only 33 but looks ten years older than that and ""worn out"" is a better descriptor than ""sexy."" The films content is sufficiently tame for it to fall into the PG-13 category but thats not a fundamental flaw. Mean Girls showed that an R isnt necessary for a film to possess bite yet John Tucker Must Die is toothless. The jokes are obvious and unfunny the storyline goes nowhere thats interesting or unexpected and the only chemistry happens in a science lab. The movie may be able to bamboozle a few teen female fans into multiplexes but its hard to imagine any of them - even those who swoon at the sight of Jesse Metcalf - labeling this as better than forgettable. And for anyone outside that demographic unfortunate enough to endure John Tucker Must Die the memory will be too painful to fade quickly.

The antics of four scorned high school girls bent on revenge are meant to be grounded in hellish fury. But the vengeance fizzles both in intent and in cinematic execution. Three popular babes -- the cheerleader (Ashanti) the free-spirit rebel (Sophia Bush) and the over-achieving club president (Arielle Kebbel) -- find out theyre all dating the same basketball hunk (Desperate Housewives Jesse Metcalfe). With the help of a new student who calls herself ""invisible"" (Brittany Snow) the girls plot their vengeance. They decide to remake the new girl so that he falls for her and she breaks his heart. The movie starts out cleverly enough but grows insipid as the girls antics become more predictable. One scene might be misogynistic if it werent so vapid The girls substitute estrogen pills for the serial cheaters bulk-inducing tablets and he throws an emotional hissy fit at a basketball game. Metcalfe doesnt have the comedic skills to carry this scene off. Snow alternates between caustic humor and simpering sweetness. Coming off with more verve are Penn Badgley as the high school Casanovas supposedly less hunky brother. Both Ashanti and Sophia Bush acquit themselves well wringing laughs from limited characters. Tucker panders to hormone-driven teen audiences with slut jokes cleavage-cams and the lead hunk exposing his bare bottom (in a lacy red thong no less). Teen audiences like their older counterparts deserve better than a series of cliches and mild titillation disguised as a plot.

(AP Photo/20th ... more Photo 20th Century Fox/ Diyah Pera Teen revenge served up as fluffy high school romp 1 / 1 Back to Gallery John Tucker Must Die Teen comedy. Starring Jesse Metcalfe Brittany Snow Jenny McCarthy and Ashanti. Directed by Betty Thomas. (PG-13. 87 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""John Tucker Must Die"" is the second revenge comedy with female avengers to come out in so many weeks. The high school students who attempt to get even with a big man on campus for cheating on all three of them lack the superhuman resources at Uma Thurmans disposal in ""My Super Ex-Girlfriend."" But their determination is something to see and occasionally even to laugh at. The title notwithstanding no contract is put out on Johns life. Instead his trio of exes conspires to trick him into taking estrogen. Almost immediately afterward John is heard complaining to his teammates about how fat he looks in his basketball shorts. That must have been some dose he swallowed. Most of the movie is at the same level of plausibility. But as long as there are teenage girls there will be fluffy comedies about their trials with boys. This one will probably appeal to its target audience which is young enough not to have tired of watching cat fights and food fights. The film is given a boost by Brittany Snow (""American Dreams"" and ""Nip/Tuck"") in the lead role of Kate the new girl at the school where John rules. Snow plays her with the spunk of Jennifer Aniston. Youre compelled to listen to Kates woeful story of being raised by a sexy single mom (former Playmate Jenny McCarthy who can do sexy in her sleep) who has a trail of men in and out of her life. They leave so fast Kate calls them all Skip. The reason Kate is the perennial new girl is that her mother picks up and moves every time her heart is seriously broken. The source of the family income -- one house is nicer than the next -- is never made clear. Theres a lot in Jeff Lowells cliche script that needs explaining. You dont have to be clairvoyant to see that John (Jesse Metcalfe Eva Longorias hot young lover on ""Desperate Housewives"") and Kate are destined for each other. The twist is that shes used as bait by his ex-girlfriends. They show Kate who supposedly has never been out on a date how to entice the louse and then -- getting their ultimate revenge -- break his heart. Kates a quick study who soon has him totally besotted. Director Betty Thomas (""The Brady Bunch Movie"") keeps the action moving along at a brisk pace so you dont have time to think about holes in the plot like how the conspirators find the time and money for their elaborate pranks. Dont they ever have to study? Metcalfe is kind of stiff -- whatever charisma he has on the small screen doesnt translate. But Ramp;B singer Ashanti cast as an avenger is a natural on the big screen. The camera pans through the high school revealing an inordinate number of pretty girls. That rings about as true as everything else in ""John Tucker Must Die."" -- Advisory Sexual references and language.

Canoodling couple Carrie (Arielle Kebbel) and John Tucker (Jesse Metcalfe) are oblivious to waitress Kate (Brittany Snow) in John Tucker Must Die. Photo 20th Century Fox Unfortunately everybody survives John Tucker Must Die 1 / 1 Back to Gallery First of all he doesnt. Titillating imperative to the contrary no one buys the farm in John Tucker Must Die. Not even close. Hopeful cinephiles might long for pitch-black satire a la Heathers (in which the title characters must die and do at least in part) but this by-the-book high school revenge comedy has the spine of a wet ramen noodle. Early on three of the star cads ex-girlfriends discuss appropriate punishment -- death is one of the less-violent options -- but theyre not serious. They speak figuratively the only acceptable option in a PG-13 undertaking that spins humor off of rampant adolescent promiscuity but presumably wouldnt tolerate a little murder between friends. If you can call them that. The film introduces us to one John Tucker (Jesse Metcalfe the lawn boy on Desperate Housewives) a basketball captain and himbo girlfriend-juggler whose cheatin heart is revealed when three concomitant squeezes wind up in gym class together. This being Stereotype Central one of the girlfriends is a bookworm (Aquamarines Arielle Kebbel) another is a vegan activist (Sophia Bush One Tree Hill) and the third is a skin-deep cheerleader named yep Heather (Ramp;B singer Ashanti). A cat fight erupts by the volleyball net catching mousy-outsider Kate (Brittany Snow) in the crossfire. It ends when she remarks ""The guy is cheating on all of you and instead of taking it out on him youre beating up on each other?"" Thus begins the revenge plot which involves evil rumors (J.T. has VD) and estrogen supplements (J.T. has sensitive nipples) but settles finally on transforming Kate into a robotic super-vixen programmed to break his heart. At this point one would expect the movie to echo Mean Girls and Shes All That and one would be right. Just envision teenagers in female attack position -- hand on hip chin thrusts at the ready -- and you get the general idea. John Tucker Must Die also features Penn Badgley (from The Bedford Diaries) as Johns supposedly not-hot brother whos the unsuspecting recipient of this grammarians nightmare ""I thought he was you guyss (pronounced EWE GIZES) god"" So says Kate who assumes everyone on the b-ball team like worships J.T. Like duh. The entire unspoken aim of the movie seems to be slobbering J.T. worship. His liars charm deserves comeuppance but never gets it; the film cant ignore the guys infernal cuteness long enough to really smack him around. (And while shots of Metcalfe in a thong are good for a laugh endless adoring scenes of a near-naked Tucker are a bit cough unseemly. A reference to Abercrombie doesnt help.) Director Betty Thomas (who made the instantly forgettable I-Spy) and screenwriter Jeff Lowell a TV sitcom scribe cant decide what they want. They want to be hip and punchy and cruel and they want their herpes jokes but they also want everything hunky-dory in the end. In the finales group catharsis the dirtbag playa and his vengeful harpies smoosh birthday cake into each others faces before a teeming crowd. So John Tucker Must Die must he? If you insist.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post The most useful thing I could say regarding ""John Tucker Must Die"" would be a warning to discerning parents of 10- or 11-year-old girls. If the kids remain blissfully ignorant about sex jokes keep them well away from this tart-tongued mediocrity. ""John Tucker Must Die"" is one of those tweener high school romps that prove just how tone-deaf the ratings system and Hollywood marketing wizards can be. The girls dress like pole dancers with the surgery to back it up the guys cant wait to ""tap that"" and the parents stuck in the audience can only hope the mom in the next row who brought her 6-year-old is blushing in the dark. But what if youre 15 you say or the mall chauffeur dropping four 13-year-olds at the cineplex for the afternoon? In that case the plot of ""John Tucker"" is serviceable akin to any number of Shakespeare knockoffs like ""Shes the Man."" Just know that a graduating class full of thrusting hips and double entendres earns ""John Tucker"" every bit of its PG-13 rating. When Jenny McCarthy plays the responsible maternal figure enough has been said. Can you tell I sat between an 11-year-old and a 14-year-old and could barely keep my mind on the movie for all my embarrassment? I did manage to catch a few of the story twists. Brittany Snow is Kate who in voice-over tells us her mother picks losers for dates and then leaves town every time she breaks up. (For those paying attention yes this was exactly the beginning of last years ""The Perfect Man."" For a minute there I thought the screening had simply ordered a DVD from Netflix.) At her new high school John Tucker (Jesse Metcalfe) is captain of the basketball team and the local lothario. He dates the most beautiful girls at school and lies to all of them. Three of the wronged girls link up with Kate to try to ruin Tuckers perfect life. Of course Kate is the bait luring him into his first real love and then dumping him. Of course Kate will fall for the jerk meanwhile leaving a more deserving boy to choke on her glitter. The tricks on John Tucker include falsely outing him as a carrier of genital herpes and putting estrogen in his weightlifting supplements so that he can cry and otherwise ""act like a girl."" On second thought parents keep all those daughters at home no matter what the age Isnt high school hard enough without dreck like this? Former ""Hill Street Blues"" tough-woman cop Betty Thomas directs ""John Tucker"" as if it were a TV episode starring Hilary Duff. Thomas has done much better - see ""Private Parts"" and ""The Brady Bunch Movie."" This one feels as if it were mailed in during senior skip week.

Comments John Tucker Must Die Three teens (Ashanti Sophia Bush Arielle Kebbel) discover theyve been sharing the same boyfriend (Jesse Metcalfe) and conspire to make him fall for a reclusive pal (Brittany Snow) whos bound to break his heart. Betty Thomas directing a script by TV veteran Jeff Lowell seems uncertain whether to sympathize with her three heroines or with the title cad but theres something mildly charming about this cheerful revenge comedys lack of any straightforward moral agenda.

Less bloodthirsty than its title would suggest the feisty teen revenge comedy ""John Tucker Must Die"" follows the ""Heathers"" and ""Mean Girls"" mold of teaming an impressionable heroine with a trio of imperious high school babes; this time however theyre united in their mission to eradicate not mean girls but a boy whos broken one heart too many. Predictable developments are more or less redeemed by spirited execution and the pleasures of an able good-looking cast -- which means Fox stands a fair chance of turning ""Must Die"" into must-see teen fare. After briefly introducing herself by way of self-deprecating voiceover lovely but socially inept teenager Kate (Brittany Snow) quickly turns the story over to its rightful subject John Tucker (Jesse Metcalfe) captain of the basketball team and the most popular stud on campus. As Kate finds out through her waitressing job John is secretly dating three girls at once hot-tempered head cheerleader Heather (pop/Ramp;B singer Ashanti); extracurricular overachiever and multimedia whiz Carrie (Arielle Kebbel); and bodacious vegan Beth (Sophia Bush). Its not long before the truth comes out and after a nicely staged three-way catfight in which Kate becomes unfortunately entangled the four girls band together to punish John for his lady-killing ways. Their initial stabs at tarnishing his image -- spiking his muscle supplements with estrogen for instance -- are conceived along sitcomish lines but play out amusingly enough. John ever the rebounder has an uncanny ability to turn even his setbacks into suave victories. And when he dumps Heather Carrie and Beth in rapid succession (in a sharply cut sequence that plays up the girls interchangeability) they decide to exact the ultimate revenge by setting him up with naive inexperienced Kate -- easy enough once she joins the cheer squad -- and then have her break his heart. What follows is essentially a very frothy youthful update of ""Les liaisons dangereuses"" with the added twist that both girl and guy are scamming each other. Kates friends initiate her in the alien rituals of high school courtship while John nearly exhausts his supply of empty sweet talk trying to score with this beguilingly hard-to-get newcomer. Screenplay is the first feature-length effort from TV scribe Jeff Lowell (""Spin City"") and while it boasts a confident structure and quite a few saucy one-liners several of the key set-pieces -- one of which has John tricked into wearing female undies -- feel recycled from old ""Friends"" episodes. Nor does the pic quite know what to do with Johns sensitive younger brother Scott (Penn Badgley) or Kates mom Lori (Jenny McCarthy) whose constantly revolving door of boyfriends is meant to provide her daughter with an emotional history. Helmer Betty Thomas (""Private Parts"" ""The Brady Bunch Movie"") has a snappy engaging style and an occasional weakness for belaboring jokes. But to her credit she doesnt even try to pass off this glossy enjoyable comic fantasy as a credible slice of high school life and she casts a sympathetic net around all her characters mainly by letting their charisma speak for itself. Snow whose adorable blend of innocence and spunk suggests a less worldly Olsen twin makes Kate easy to root for as a stuttering wallflower who grows in naughty confidence. As her partners in crime Ashanti Kebbel and Bush tear into their parts with bitchy enthusiasm though their snippy backbiting is at times overdirected. Metcalfe last seen as Eva Longorias botanical boy-toy on ""Desperate Housewives"" could hardly be more ideally cast as a smooth operator who even at his most caddish is almost too charming to loathe. When someone warns him that Kate isnt his type and he retorts ""Girl is my type"" one is hard-pressed to disagree. Musical selections supervised by Alexandra Patsavas strike mostly obvious notes although Rick Nielsens ""I Want You to Want Me"" is thoughtfully integrated into the action.

"John Tucker Must Die Girls Behaving Badly washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On John Tucker Must Die Girls Behaving Badly Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints Friday July 28 2006 ""John Tucker Must Die"" is one of those teen romantic comedies set at Britney Spears Memorial High School where everyones hot honey blonde and hooking up. Appropriately enough the lead role -- a putative misfit named Kate -- is played by Brittany Snow whose generic cuteness recalls a young Reese Witherspoon or the wholesome Olsen twin. When Kate starts at a new school she discovers that the BMOC -- Big Manipulator of Cheerleaders -- has been three-timing a bevy of precocious classmates; she leads the girls in a sadistic revenge spree that includes putting his face on an ad for herpes awareness and spiking his bulking powder with estrogen. ""John Tucker Must Die"" (which could have been called ""In the Company of Mean Girls"") features a clutch of rising stars including ""Desperate Housewives "" Jesse Metcalfe Sophia Bush Arielle Kebbel and the Ramp;B star Ashanti. But despite doing its best to jiggle giggle and ogle its way into a niche somewhere between ""Heathers"" and ""American Pie"" it becomes just another forgettable pastiche of sight gags and pop-culture references. At one point a would-be suitor of Kates describes her affection for old-school Elvis Costello obscure podcasts and Dave Eggers ""Shes deep man."" And this movie isnt dude. -- Ann Hornaday John Tucker Must Die PG-13 87 minutes Contains sexual content and profanity. Area theaters.

Ostensibly hes been caught dating three pretty girls at the same time but really is that a big deal? Well no according to this confused female-disempowerment flick. The trio -- assisted by a cherubic Brittany Snow -- plot delicious revenges on handsome John. But astonishingly (and offensively) the witless ending comes down harder on the women than the cad.
