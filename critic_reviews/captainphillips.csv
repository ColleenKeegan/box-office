The camera hovers above stacks and stacks of big bright 8-by-40-foot rectangles. What the shot establishes is a location. Were at the Port of Salalah in Oman. But the stacks also establish the stakes of the stress and emotional devastation to come. Once the ship is hijacked every shot that features even a bit of all that tonnage recasts it Lots of men and women risk their lives to make and deliver goods that some people take for granted. A world away some other people covet what those goods signify. A few of those people become pirates. And astonishingly this movie is as much about them as it is about their victims. Captain Phillips dramatizes the story of an actual 2009 incident in which armed Somali men came aboard an enormous Maersk container ship headed for Mombasa. The hijacking scenes are tense and swift and grimly ironic. The ships captain a trim goateed New Englander named Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) is in the middle of conducting security drills when he notices a suspicious blip approaching on the radar. There have been warnings of trouble near the Horn of Africa but its clear that even without a threat Phillips runs a tight ship. Early in the movie the captain interrupts a coffee break and sends the crew to their stations. The glowers that he wins are the ones you give a boss who seems to take his authority too seriously. But once its clear the ship has been targeted the men shed their exasperation and spring into action. But they have doubts. The camera gets in close on the crews worried agitated faces. But Phillips who is nervous as well exerts his authority. They dont have a choice. The maritime authorities havent given the most useful instructions. The crew have to be prepared to defend themselves. Phillips tries to be resourceful. He knows the men in the skiff are on his radio signal so he fakes a military call to intimidate the blip. All along were also in the rocketing rickety skiff. Actually the movie does something more remarkable. It grants the men in the boat their own side of the story. Not long after Phillips hugs his wife (Catherine Keener) good-bye in New Hampshire theres a shot of commotion in a Somali fishing village. The local industry no longer appears to be very lucrative. The men are bullied into piracy often more than once only to return the spoils to the local warlord. There are ships near the Horn of Africa. The task of catching and taking over one goes to four ropy men with geometrically long faces Muse (Barkhad Abdi) Najee (Faysal Ahmed) Bilal (Barkhad Abdirahman) and Elmi (Mahat M. Ali). As a quartet they shove off toward the Maersk ship in part because they have no choice. But they also have a kind of Robin Hood bravado. They want a multi-million-dollar ransom because whoever owns the ship can afford it. When they find out their target is an American ship the Somalis react as though theyve won the Powerball. Logically the films two halves first meet on the ships bridge. What occurs between them first is potboiler action stuff. Phillips tries in vain to keep the Somalis from discovering the 20 or so men hiding far below near the engines. He keeps his walkie-talkie open so the crew can improvise based on what hes telling the intruders. He tells them to take the ships 30000 in cash and a lifeboat and go. A couple of the Somalis view that as an insult. A series of events forces them off the ship and into the little orange boat anyway. But they take the captain with them as a hostage and a film already thriving in close quarters only intensifies in a space 28 feet long. The film spends the second half alternating between the lifeboat and the American militarys attempt to find and rescue Phillips. All the men do is sit and wait and shout and talk -- and as they do the films moral sophistication begins to work on you. Captain Phillips is actually based on two true stories the catastrophe Phillips documented in his book A Captains Duty Somali Pirates Navy SEALS and Dangerous Days at Sea and Hollywoods dehumanization of the Third World. Theres every reason to catch the advertisements for this movie and throw up your hands. Tom Hanks versus the bad Africans is so Hollywood its almost farcical. When the Somalis climb aboard the ship and think theyve hit the jackpot you almost expect them to see Hankss face and run Well never win But the movie Greengrass has made from Billy Rays script shrewdly frustrates that expectation. He knows hes crafting a thriller about the abduction of Hanks and that in doing so hes raising the bar high for the movies humanist challenge. Can he get you to see more than Phillipss peril? Can he get you to understand the Somalis as well? In so many ways Captain Phillips reckons with the hazards of a consumer economy not just the goods that one country ships to another but the images and ideas that Western nations export around the world. The way the movie portrays the Somalis initially feels typical of how the movies treat Arabs and Africans. Theyre screaming lunatics whose eyes pop out of their heads. Najee is especially one-dimensional. Hes no less unstable on the lifeboat but by then the tenor of the movie has changed. Hes unstable and irrational but hes also desperate both for a way out of this mess and for more of the extremely addictive khat the Somalis incessantly chew but have run out of. Theyre running a hostage situation essentially in withdrawal. Despising the Somalis becomes harder as you watch them take distressed looks out of the little lifeboat window and see a gigantic military closing in on them. Before Greengrass made movies he was a journalist and as a filmmaker he provides the illusion of objectivity. Hes a docudramatist. In Bloody Sunday and his two Jason Bourne movies -- to say nothing of United 93 -- you see what Greengrass wants you to see. But you also feel free to draw your own conclusions. (His Iraq war film Green Zone came too close to taking a side but pretended to walk a straight apolitical line. Thats the only film hes made where his approach left him with a hollow phony movie.) Its not as if you cant detect a sensibility. Hes the opposite of Michael Bay Greengrass makes jumpy fretful action thrillers about the consequences of action. Its possible to like both mens films. Its even possible to pretend theres no significant difference. And the hawkishly inclined are free to love the Bourne movies without reservation. But where Bay unconditionally partakes in the permissions and entitlements of the intelligence- and defense-industrial complex Greengrass approaches the use of force with intelligent complexity. His movies feature settings too far-flung to ignore the impact of all that force. The sense of outrage and shame in a Greengrass movie would get him called a pussy in Bay village. Greengrass works in a tough physical overwhelming immersive style. Much of that sense of on-the-ground reporting comes from use of handheld cameras. Barry Ackroyd is Captain Phillipss cinematographer and for once Greengrasss seasick-inducing moviemaking has a natural home. That style leaves you feeling jostled exposed unsafe and frequently out of breath. His movies are scary because like some good news stories they dont feel as if theyre trying to protect you. Theres a dangerous recklessness about his filmmaking leading to movies that feel like speeding cars with no seat belts windshields or brakes. That chaos is of course highly controlled. Captain Phillips made me think the same thing I thought about United 93 How did he do that? You could leave the latter movie wondering about why it was made but the elusive skill of its maker is never in doubt. Captain Phillips forces the viewer to wrestle with a different kind of intent. Its the rare movie about Western guilt that doesnt wallow or pity. What some moviegoers will experience in that lifeboat is not Stockholm syndrome. Its a hard searing empathy. In every Greengrass movie whats at stake is both personal and political. But Captain Phillips represents a subtle new risk for his globalist existentialism. This is a film about bigness and smallness. The five men bob atop the Gulf of Aden as if they were in a toddlers bath-time tugboat. Both the captain and his captors are tiny players in a larger geopolitical configuration. The framing bears this out. Theres more than one shot of the lifeboat shown not far from a U.S. destroyer. Early on the Somalis approaching skiff shares the camera frame with the container ship which tries to maneuver away from the smaller nimbler boat. Theres also the relentlessness of Americas first-class military focusing on four men from a Third World nation the undeniable appeal of Hankss stardom versus the relative anonymity of his costars (though the movie certainly closes the gap there especially with Barkhad Abdi who carves out a moving performance) and the achievement of Hanks bringing his stardom to bear on this small intense feat of acting. That discrepancy in size also gets at the matter of privilege. Greengrass sets up the movies finale so that the tremendous effort that goes into Phillipss rescue is almost embarrassing in its scope. Another movie would have reduced the many scenes with the maritime authorities and the Navy in order to show Phillipss family and friends huddled together in anguish. But once Keener says good-bye she never comes back. The character isnt needed. Nothing about this movie is cheap. The mere awareness of the divergent fates of the men in the lifeboat is enough to break your heart. Muse remains reasonably optimistic that his elders will also come for him and the others. But we know better. For a privileged audience thats the power of this movie. It elicits guilt not about being citizens of a nation that would move heaven and earth to save you from pirates but about knowing that the American movie industry has been churning out a version of this situation for a century and calling it entertainment. The effort to rescue Phillips serves a purpose different from say the procedural scenes in the air-traffic control room in United 93. They have the force of a precision-oriented hurricane and yet its interesting that Greengrass doesnt push the military action in a manner that could be construed as heroic. It feels like work. Heroism is something the movie is striving against. It cant even be applied to Phillips. He was just doing his job too. Captain Phillips wrecked me before Hanks released the valve on his stoicism but when he did I sobbed. Its the most powerful acknowledgment Ive ever seen of the comparative unfairness of simply being born. Both the world and pop culture place lesser value on certain lives. Either you live somewhere that will make a movie about the time the Navy rescued you from pirates or you dont. The difference here is tragic. The Somalis had their reasons for storming that ship. But the movie doesnt ask us to be naive about what theyve done. It trusts us to understand the hijacking for the crime it is -- and to know that these sorts of crimes happen in the world. But it also dares you to consider the despair behind the crime. Greengrass entrusts the audience with complexities of the bigger picture. Over and over in this movie we hear variations on the phrase ""everythings going to be OK."" Its just impossible to head out of the theater and back into the wider world believing thats actually true.

"Captain Phillips - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Captain Phillips Posted by Christy Lemire on October 14 2013 8 Comments Sony Pictures Rated PG-13 for sustained intense sequences of menace some violence with bloody images and for substance abuse. Running time 134 minutes. Three stars out of four. Theres a scene at the end of ""Captain Phillips"" in which Richard Phillips the all-business captain of an American cargo ship thats been invaded by Somali pirates finally reveals the cumulative toll this ordeal has taken on him. After days of threats and thirst maneuvering and manipulation within cramped spaces in the middle-of-nowhere western Indian Ocean Phillips -- played by Tom Hanks -- now can allow himself to breathe tremble weep and begin the process of healing. The entire performance is one of the greatest in Hanks prolific varied career -- a role that gives him a massive arc and the opportunity to show great range. Paul Greengrass film is based on the true story of a 2009 pirate attack off the Somalian coast and despite the inescapable tension the director achieves we know that the real-life Phillips made it out alive; this is no spoiler here folks he wrote the book that provided the basis for this movie. But what Hanks does is extraordinary because its so subtle Hes the hardworking everyman who becomes an accidental hero but he also must remain accessible as he serves as our guide through this harrowing world. He has moments of daring but many more of quiet resourcefulness. Yes his New England accent is distractingly bad and Phillips wasnt the most jovial of fellows on the high seas which initially makes it difficult for the crew members of the Maersk Alabama (and for us) to warm up to him. But when the situation gets gnarly -- and it does in a hurry -- you want this veteran a man of strength smarts and preparedness on your side. Hanks masterfully handles both the mundane early moments on the ship as well as the manic later ones. Which brings us back to the scene I mentioned at the beginning of the review and the stylistic tendency of Greengrass that keeps his very good film from being great. Phillips had put on a brave face for both his captors and his crew for so long. Once hes safe and under the care of Navy medical specialists he finally lets go; covered in blood -- most of which is not his own -- he stammers in shock. Hes bewildered. He cant believe he made it out alive. Its a tremendous piece of acting; his performance seems unforced yet the catharsis is palpable. Still Greengrass feels the need to rove with his camera and overpower the scene further with a dramatic score when the inherent drama of the moment is more than sufficient. This kind of in-your-face kinetic filmmaking which weve come to know as Greengrass signature can be a distraction but it can also be his strength. As in his excellent ""United 93"" about the hijacked flight that crash-landed in a Pennsylvania field on Sept. 11 2001 hes telling a story to which we already know the outcome. But his action sequences are so intimate and detailed and he cranks up the suspense so steadily we find ourselves immersed nonetheless. ""Captain Phillips"" begins on what should have been an ordinary morning as Phillips wife (a woefully underused Catherine Keener -- seriously shes in one scene) drives him to the Burlington Vt. airport for his latest journey. This establishing scene is the weakest in Billy Rays script as Phillips and his wife speak broadly and blandly about how the world is changing so quickly all around them. Once Phillips and his men take off for their trip around the Horn of Africa it doesnt take long for a ragtag but brazen group of Somali outlaws to hop in their speedboats and head in their direction with dollar signs in their eyes in the millions. Armed with automatic weapons a ladder and just enough technology (and stimulants) to make them dangerous they cop the jacked-up bravado of Wild West desperadoes gearing up for a train heist -- one of many examples in ""Captain Phillips"" of the repercussions of globalization. Their leader is a young man named Muse aptly nicknamed Skinny for his nearly emaciated appearance. The fact that hes so intimidating despite his slight frame is part of his frightening allure. Barkhad Abdi a 27-year-old former limousine driver making his acting debut appears opposite Hanks for nearly all of his screen time and surprisingly holds his own with the Oscar-winner. (Abdi however is the only one of the four actors playing the pirates who gets the benefit of much characterization; the others are sort of interchangeably crazed with greed.) Phillips Muse and their men engage in an increasingly fraught game of cat and mouse both on board the massive cargo ship and within the much smaller and more cramped lifeboat in which Phillips and the attackers ultimately find themselves. Greengrass skill is really on display in both of these scenarios given that he has to provide perspective tension and narrative drive in a disparate and challenging spectrum of spaces. But because ""Captain Phillips"" is a big American studio picture that aims to wow audiences as well as awards voters Greengrass also has to portray good guys and bad guys winners and losers and hang those tags on people and struggles that cant be categorized so easily in the real world. We want to be unnerved for a couple of hours (and ""Captain Phillips"" could have benefited from some trimming) but we also want to walk away feeling good about ourselves. The pirates may suffer from a lack of motivation and characterization but were left cheering America ... fuck yeah And oh yeah that Tom Hanks -- he can really act. Tweet Category Reviews Tags Barkhad Abdi Catherine Keener Paul Greengrass pirates Somalia Tom Hanks 8 Comments on ""Captain Phillips"" October 15 2013  by  Douglas Roy     Beyond that final emotional breakdown sequence of Tom Hanks as Captain Phillips I found Henry Jackmans thunderous score quite relevant to all the rising and falling action in this melodramatic film. Ill also assume that Catherine Keener had more expository scenes filmed but were edited for time. Nice observations once again Christy. Reply October 15 2013  by  JozieLee     Tom Hanks works so much and has taken on so many forgettable roles that its easy to forget how talented he is. Then he shows up in PHILADELPHIA FORREST GUMP CAST AWAY and we remember why we love watching him at work. Didnt think Id see CAPTAIN PHILLIPS but your review changed my mind. Reply October 15 2013  by  Christy Lemire     Jozie Ill be curious to hear your thoughts once you see it. Hope I dont steer you wrong Reply October 17 2013  by  JozieLee     Holy Moly was that intense. The movie started and I was so immersed in the story I lost track of time. One act led to the next to the next and somehow were adrift at sea in a tiny capsule knowing how it would end but wondering how wed get there. Quite a fascinating story. And I loved the movie tho for me it has a few flaws. Grainy film in opening scenes especially the Somalian village and the pirates at sea. I didnt understand why that filming technique was used. I could have done without the overused in-ur-face shaky camera. The technique effectively added drama and fervor to the events but after a while I got tired of looking up nostrils and inside open mouths. Admittedly effective in Hanks final scene. I am left with a few questions which the book probably answers so Ill have to read it. 1. The shipping company was aware of pirating in that area. Why didnt they employ security? Why didnt the captain or a designated crew member have a gun . . . they had flairs which the captain used to deter the pirates but no gun. 2. In the closing credits were told Captain Phillips was reunited with his family and that hes returned to work but were not told what happened to all the pirates. Also we arent told how this act changed international shipping methods. How amazing in this day and age with all the technology and war power in our arsenal a couple of bandits weilding a knife and shot gun could hold America hostage. David and Goliath. Finally Im struck by Muses dream of coming to America . . . Reply February 9 2014  by  Jimmy Spadola     Hello Jozie We just rented Captain Philip last night thank God for On Demand and both of us were blown away. Really an amazing story We agree on most of what you said...especially the fact that they didnt carry any guns on board for protection...DA In an answer to your question... If Im not mistaken in the credits at the end of the movie they do state that Muse is currently searing a 33yr. prison sentence and of course the other 3 are dead In a VERY strong year of acting performances it was unfortunate that Tom Hanks was the odd man for the Oscar...all 5 nominees are worthy...to bad they couldnt add a 6th...however its Matthew McConaughys year However Barkhad Abdi is nominated in the best supporting actor category. Tom Hankss final scene is brilliant ...absolutely brilliant. I had dreams about this movie...It kept me up all night...left me very unsettled. Great filmmaking will do that. Reply October 17 2013  by  JozieLee     At IMDB message boards someone posted a Qamp;A that answered my questions. http//www.historyvshollywood.com/reelfaces/captain-phillips.php Reply November 2 2013  by  Russell Dee     Great movie Weve been lucky to have some really good movies this year. Reply November 3 2013  by  pattylg1 thinker     I was seasick. The shaky camera even on land or in a solid ship on smooth seas made this terrific action film impossible for me to watch. They should have a ride warning like there are for theme parks. Movie picked me up and carried me off to sea but I saw most of the outside of the theater with a handful of other film goers.

""I came too far"" their leader explains. ""I cant give up.""Related Story The Spectacular Simplicity of Gravity Is Paul Greengrasss Captain Phillips the most inadvertently resonant movie of the year? The film is of course based on the real-life hijacking of the Maersk Alabama by Somali pirates in 2009 not on the real-life hijacking of the federal government by a few dozen GOP House members last week. But as inexact--and to some no doubt unreasonable--as the comparison may be I cant be the only one who noticed the thematic similarities. The pirates are even led by a relatively sensible conciliatory fellow (wonderfully played by first-time actor and Somali refugee Barkhad Abdi) who is cowed by his ever-more-intemperate compatriots ...But on to the film itself. It begins unpromisingly with the titular Captain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) packing for his upcoming voyage and introducing us to his genuinely painful Boston accent. (Dont worry It recedes noticeably over time.) Phillips banters with his wife (a thoroughly wasted Catherine Keener) about their grown children about the changing world (""Everythings different big wheels a turning"") and other comparably tedious bits of backstory/foreshadowing.As soon as Phillips is aboard his immense cargo ship in Oman however preparing to embark around the horn of Africa to Mombasa Greengrasss film settles into a comfortable groove spare and realistic. Preparations are completed (x metric tons of fresh water y metric tons of fuel) anchors are weighed (""bow thrusters"" ""dead slow ahead"") and the vessel--and with it the film--gets underway.Greengrass takes various liberties with the ensuing plot with perhaps the greatest being his failure to note that Phillips took his craft within 240 miles of the Somali coast despite a U.S. advisory to remain at least 600 miles offshore. In any case pirates are encountered--their tiny craft dwarfed by their gargantuan prey--repelled with hoses and then encountered again. This time a band of four Somalis manages to board the ship armed with AK-47s and palpable desperation and the Alabama crew--most of whom have taken refuge in the engine room--begin resisting the takeover of their ship by any means available.What unfolds is an escalating game of cat and mouse in which each side is defined more clearly by its weaknesses than its strengths. The crew of the Alabama have the numbers but not the weapons. The pirates have the weapons but no sense of the ship and--once it becomes clear to them that the crew does not intend to cooperate cheerfully with their 10 million ransom demand--no real idea of what to do next. Initially their advantage seems to reside in their willingness to kill. But by the time two U.S. Navy warships arrive on the scene it has become clear that their true advantage lies in their willingness to die. The final act of the film takes place (as followers of the news will recall) with the pirates and their last hostage Phillips crowded into a tiny airless covered lifeboat surrounded by the overwhelming force of the U.S. military. The movies initial irony--of a ship the height of an office building and the length of one-and-a-half football fields being taken captive by a skiff with an outboard motor--has come full circle and the world order reasserted itself.Greengrass has directed gripping films both fantasy-based (The Bourne Supremacy The Bourne Ultimatum) and all-too-real (United 93). With Captain Phillips he finds an extremely effective middle path providing an edge-of-the-seat thriller that is also something more--but not so much more that it ceases to be a thriller. The directors customary reliance on handheld camera-work (by cinematographer Barry Ackroyd) though overused in the early going becomes increasing apt as the film accelerates into its nerve-jangling later acts. Greengrasss underlying humanism moreover lends moral depth and sophistication to the proceedings. Yes this is the tale of one mans courage under adversity. But it is one in which the ""villains"" are as textured and relatable as the heroes.Yes this is the tale of one mans courage under adversity. But it is one in which the ""villains"" are as textured and relatable as the heroes.Credit on this score must also be given to the large cast which is unassuming in its excellence and in particular to the movies two very disparate leads. Despite his iconic status it has been a long time since Hanks has challenged himself as an actor to this degree (unless I suppose you count the dubious challenge he undertook with Cloud Atlas). And there is as noted a hint of Hanksian hamminess to his work at the outset of the movie. But it is pared away slice by slice until what emerges is an exceptional portrait of the simple nobility of doing ones job even when it no longer resembles the job one signed up for. (Hanks is so good in the role that its easy to forgive one dialed-up-to-11 scene at the conclusion that might as well have had ""For Your Consideration"" stamped on the print.)At the other end of the spectrum Barkhad Abdi is a revelation as Muse the leader of the pirates. Twenty years ago when Abdi was a boy his family fled Somalia and ultimately made their way thanks to a lottery visa to Minneapolis. It was there that on a whim Abdi answered a 2009 open casting call for Greengrasss film. The neophyte actor now 28 offers a performance that is the perfect complement to Hanks where the latter gradually strips his character down to its essential core Abdi builds his up from a stick-figure teen full of bravado to a genuinely sympathetic figure who has come to understand just how far in over his head hes gotten. One hopes Hollywood can find further roles for Abdi in the future.Captain Phillips is in short a terrific film and I look forward to watching it again at a moment when I--and yes perhaps only I--wont be distracted by echoes of the congressional news of the day. Theres one point early in the movie as the pirates are first bearing down on the Alabama when the first mate (Michael Chernus) attempts to radio for help but to no avail ""Theres no answer at the U.S. maritime emergency line"" My immediate thought was god I hope thats not the kind of government function thats affected by the shutdown. And I presume its not two-thirds of the employees of the Transportation Department are still at their desks. But my rudimentary effort to reassure myself was unhelpful. When I called the press office of the U.S. Maritime Administration I reached the following message ""We will be out of the office due to a lapse in funding. Please call back after news reports advise of a resumption of services by all federal agencies.""

In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Chris Keane / Reuters North Carolinas Deliberate Disenfranchisement of Black Voters David A. Graham A federal appeals court finds the impact of the states voting law can only be explained by ""discriminatory intent."" Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz.

At the end of 2013 in the low-slung industrial Taiwanese city of Kaohsiung a bevy of officials came to attend the ribbon cutting of a huge former hotel that had undergone a top-to-bottom multimillion-dollar renovation. Speaking before the throngs of celebrants who blocked the flow of traffic Taiwans deputy director of the Ministry of the Interior praised the group that funded the renovation and presented them for the 10th year straight with the national ""Excellent Religious Group"" award. ""For years you have dedicated your time and lives to anti-drug work and human- rights dissemination"" said the director echoing praise offered by the mayors office and the presidents national-policy adviser.

Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Khizr Khan began his speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday with words I wish he didnt have to say ""Tonight we are honored to stand here as parents of Captain Humayun Khan and as patriotic American Muslims--as patriotic American Muslims with undivided loyalty to our country."" I wish he and his wife didnt have to stand there as the parents of a 27-year-old Army captain who was killed by suicide bombers while serving in the Iraq War. And I wish Khizr Khan hadnt felt the need to declare his patriotism and loyalty to the United States of America. Those truths should have been self-evident. The state of the union is not strong when an American feels compelled to clarify such things. In better times Khizr Khan who was born in Pakistan and moved to America from the United Arab Emirates might have begun his speech with what he said next ""Like many immigrants we came to this country empty-handed. We believed in American democracy--that with hard work and [the] goodness of this country we could share in and contribute to its blessings.""

Hillary Clinton is out of the frying pan and into the fire. On July 6 Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that the Justice Department would not pursue criminal charges against the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee for her use of a private email server at the State Department. But the following day with that criminal investigation closed the State Department reopened its own probe into the emails the AP reported. State Department spokesman John Kirby told the AP that it would be looking at potential mishandling of classified information by Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Former officials could face administrative sanctions including a loss of their security clearances--a step that would be both politically embarrassing for Clinton and complicate efforts to staff a national-security team should she prevail in November.

Just an extroidinary performance. Ryansaid on Saturday November 02 2013 24742 PMMasterful camera work from Paul Greengrass and excellent acting from Tom hanks makes this one of the best movies I have seen in a few years. It is also the best thriller I have seen all year. Joseph R. Jonessaid on Sunday October 20 2013 51011 PMCompletely agree that Hanks was excellent but I will be shocked if Barkhad Abdi isnt at least nominated for best supporting actor. He delivered a phenomenal performance that was the highlight of an already exceptional film. Great actor so nuanced. To be ruthless yet still have a shred of humanity that the audience can empathize with is impressive enough but sharing the screen with Hanks for half a movie and still being memorable is a feat in and of itself. The pacing was perfect too - perfect blend of drama and adrenaline. Jonathan Lemmonsaid on Friday October 18 2013 104029 PMI saw a prescreening of Captain Phillips exactly one month ago. It really is one of Tom Hankss finer works. I especially loved the final moments. I wont say what they are but they really take your breath away. I actually remember hearing about this piracy situation back in 2009. I was only fifteen at the time but I remember it was the biggest news since 9/11. Greengrass did a fascinating job with this real life story rather than giving it the Hollywood treatment which he could have easily done but thankfully didnt. This film will definitely earn some Oscar nominations including Best Actor (Of course) Best Director and it will most likely win some sound editing and mixing because it really feels like you are in there with Phillips in that terrifying situation. /5 James S.said on Wednesday October 16 2013 74941 PMGood Lord I hope Im not alone in my feeling that this is far and away Tom Hanks best work on film. What an extraordinary performance in an extraordinary movie. And Greengrass--this guy just keeps getting better. diana floressaid on Saturday October 12 2013 102442 PMBest 2013 movie dwchusaid on Saturday October 12 2013 35842 PMThis movie actually reminds me of Dog Day Afternoon but on the high seas and told from the POV of one of the hostages as opposed to the main antagonist Reply from Richard Roeper Well played Quite a few similarities.

Richard Phillips captain of the Maersk Alabama found the commercial ship boarded by Somali pirates who held him for ransom on a lifeboat for five days until the Navy SEALs came to the rescue. Over and out. End of heroic story. More News Peter Travers Fall Movie Preview All Stories >> Not so fast baby. Captain Phillips directed with docudrama vigor by Paul Greengrass from a scrappy script Billy Ray adapted from Phillips own memoir is not content with standing just-the-facts duty. It wants more. It wants to dig like Greengrass did in United 93 and Bloody Sunday to find the heart beating under the kinetic surface. Luckily Greengrass has just the right actor to help him excavate this incredibly true story. Tom Hanks at the top of his everyman game starts by playing Phillips with deceptive simplicity. On his way to the job starting from the port of Oman Phillips and his wife (Catherine Keener) discuss their children and the difficulty of finding a job in todays market. But the prevalence of piracy hovers no less troubling for going unspoken. Onboard Phillips is no-nonsense with his crew relying on routine drills to ensure safety measures. When the pirates seen briefly on their turf taking orders from warlords start following the Alabama in skiffs the tension kicks in hard. The Alabama is bigger and faster than the skiffs but laws at the time required that merchant vessels be unarmed. Only hoses could be used to stop the pirates from boarding on ropes. Fat chance. These scenes superbly shot by Barry Ackroyd (The Hurt Locker) generate suspense that only intensifies when Muse (Barkhad Abdi) the leader of the pirates shoves a gun in the captains face. The extraordinary Abdi a Mogadishu emigre living in Minneapolis had never acted before. Yet he crushes his scenes with Hanks his skinny bravado a force to reckon with. The captain he calls ""Irish"" offers 30000 but Muse wants millions. What follows is a cat-and-mouse game between the crew in hiding on the ship and the pirates including Najee (Faysal Ahmed) Elmi (Mahat M. Ali) and the teenage Bilal (Barkhad Abdirahman). It might have all been another Hollywood-formula flick with American might taking on the alien other. But Greengrass gives Phillips and Muse the time aboard a covered lifeboat to discover shared beliefs and fears. ""I have bosses"" Muse explains of his demands. ""We all have bosses"" says Phillips indicating a chain of command that transcends local politics and cultures. Hanks who has been tremendous throughout hits a new career peak when the captain succumbs to post-traumatic stress. This is acting of the highest order in a movie that raises the bar on what a true-life action thriller can do.

By Peter Rainer Film critic October 11 2013 Save for later Saved Capt. Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) of the cargo ship MV Maersk Alabama stares down a Somali pirate. Columbia Pictures          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Paul Greengrass the director of ""United 93"" ""Bloody Sunday"" and two ""Bourne"" films certainly knows how to put the screws to audiences. He makes movies featuring people under extreme duress and he wants us to sweat it out too.""Captain Phillips"" his latest exercise in high-tension theatrics is not as pulpish as the ""Bourne"" movies or as politicized as ""United 93"" and ""Bloody Sunday."" Its based on the memoir of Capt. Richard Phillips whose cargo ship MV Maersk Alabama was hijacked in 2009 in the waters off the coast of Somalia by Somali pirates while en route from Oman to Mombasa Kenya. The hijacking something of a botch-up resulted in Phillips being kidnapped for ransom aboard a high-tech lifeboat bound for the Somali coast with the US Navy and a crack SEAL team in hot pursuit.Because Tom Hanks plays Phillips the Everyman vibe is here from the get-go. We first see him leaving his Vermont home to catch a flight to the Middle East. Once aboard his ship all too aware of the piracy dangers he faces he issues crisp orders to reinforce security. When the cargo ship is chased down by pirates hes prepared - and aghast. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time Especially in the ""Bourne"" movies Greengrass has gone wild for bobbly you-are-there camerawork that made me want to flee to the back row of the theater. (Why do filmmakers equate this technique with ""realism""?) Thankfully hes toned it down here. The film is tautly engineered and given the inherent claustrophobia of the situation fluidly shot. The cat-and-mouse sequence in which the pirates search the lower reaches of the ship for the hidden crew is a model of thriller dynamics. The 50 best movies of all time Video How true is the true story of Captain Phillips? Monitor Movie Guide He also makes a point of giving the four pirates who commandeer the ship enough of a back story to flesh out their desperation. No terrorists they are poor fishermen looking only to make a big score. Their leader is Muse very well played by Barkhad Abdi a Somali living in America and making his film debut. His hair-trigger anxiety is tempered by his grudging respect for Phillips - a fellow commander. As they try to outwit each other a screwed-up esprit de corps develops between these two.Hanks has always been good at playing average Joes but what must have attracted him to this part was the chance to play an average Joe in mortal danger. As Phillips he keeps a very tight hold on his temper. He knows he stands a better chance of surviving that way. When near the end he is rescued in a state of shock all that normality breaks down and a real rawness comes through. Its some of the most powerful acting Hanks has ever done.My problem with ""Captain Phillips"" albeit to a far lesser extent is the same problem I had with ""Zero Dark Thirty."" Greengrass and screenwriter Billy Ray have used a highly charged political backdrop to make in essence a glorified crime procedural. We never hear about why the international corporations funding these cargo ships allow the seamen to so perilously risk their lives. (And why arent there any guns on board?) You dont have to be a cynic to realize that if the cargo ship had been from a less powerful country than the United States no SEALs would have swooped in.I was also made a bit uncomfortable by the way the four pirates with their snarls and bulging eyes seem at times a breed apart from the whites on board. This extends to the blacks we see on the beach in the city of Eyl before the pirates set out. The film skirts perilously close to ""Heart of Darkness"" territory - the enemy as Other.Its a tribute to the films galvanizing momentum that most of these reservations didnt sink in for me until the film was over. Greengrass is an expert hijacker too. He hijacks our good sense. Grade B+ (Rated PG-13 for sustained intense sequences of menace some violence with bloody images and substance use.)

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday Oct. 09 2013 1159PM EDT Last updated Thursday Oct. 10 2013 559PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Paul Greengrass Written by Billy Ray Starring Tom Hanks Barkhad Abdi Classification 14A Year 2013 Country USA Language English Paul Greengrasss Captain Phillips is a pulse-pounding dramatization of the real-life 2009 hijacking of a U.S. cargo ship and the abduction of its captain by Somali pirates. On one level its an expert Hollywood entertainment of choreographed chaos with an impressive if familiar award-season star turn from Tom Hanks as an Everyman turned hero. Liam Lacey Video Tom Hanks in true-life story of Somali pirates this weekends best bet Yet Captain Phillips manages to expose us to a few things that are unusual in a thriller including sympathy for the enemy and in Hankss performance the frailty that is the other side of heroism.The film which opened the New York Film Festival last month has already earned some comparisons to last years two CIA-friendly thrillers Argo and Zero Dark Thirty though the association only serves to highlight the differences. The other films were in different ways about American national myth-making. Captain Phillips is primarily an individual survival tale with politics and militarism as a backdrop.Although he is best known for his globe-hopping Bourne movies (The Bourne Supremacy The Bourne Ultimatum) Greengrass spent more than a decade working in English television making documentaries and later political and social-issue TV movies. His 2002 breakthrough the Northern Irish docudrama Bloody Sunday - like his later 9/11 film United 93 - focused on ordinary people caught in political tragedies.The movie is a reminder of why Greengrass is among the best action directors working today. While jittery handheld shots whip-pans and rapid edits have become the cliches of action/horror he does the usual thing at twice the speed and with a far greater sense of when to provide punctuating moments of clarity.He also consistently emphasizes narrative structure naturalistic performances and procedural details.The script written by Billy Ray (Shattered Glass The Hunger Games) makes for a tautly structured film with an introduction and three distinct acts. The opening introduces the middle-aged taciturn Phillips (Hanks hidden behind a grey goatee and glasses) packing in his Vermont home and driving to the airport with his wife (Catherine Keener) as they discuss their two boys in college and the difficulties of these long trips. The subtly anxious undertone is about age risk and separation.Phillipss assignment is to take a container ship - the Maersk Alabama out of Norfolk Va. manned by a U.S. crew - from south Oman around the horn of Africa to Kenya carrying food aid among other cargo.The first impression is the sheer immensity of the vessel a floating factory or warehouse on the water with Phillips as the chief executive officer working with a crew of strangers. The captain is businesslike to the point of being brusque with his subordinates determined to get through this without mishap. Because of warnings about hijackings in the area Phillips puts the crew through a safety drill.On the beach in the pirate city of Eyl Somalia another crew of strangers is being assembled. Their mission is to hijack the ships passing by their coast to steal money and take hostages. The men are young and lean and carrying automatic rifles. They chew khat as a courage-building stimulant and set out in pursuit of their prey. The different scale of the two Somalian skiffs and the American cargo ship a kind of floating geopolitical metaphor looks absurd. The Somali boats resemble toys. But Captain Phillips picks them up on his radar. When he sees them quickly approaching through his binoculars he prepares the crew for an assault. The Alabama is unarmed The only deterrents are to shoot flares and spray jets of water down on the skiffs. Eventually just four men make it aboard shooting their guns in a display of intimidation and immediately take over the ship.The second act includes a game of cat and mouse aboard the ship. The 20-man crew is hidden below and Phillips stalls for time claiming improbably not to know their whereabouts. Later he insists the ship is ""broken"" and cant move. The leader of the hijackers named Muse (Barkhad Abdi a Somali-born Minneapolis resident) a young man with a piercing gaze and a leaders swagger (""Relax"" he tells Phillips. ""Look at me. Im the captain now""). He jocularly dubs Phillips ""Irish"" (the captain had said he was American of Irish descent) and tries to engage him as an equal a professional who like himself can recognize the robbery of the boat as ""just business."" And in a sense we see some validity in his argument; he says factory trawlers have depleted the Somalis traditional fishing grounds making fishing for big ships another kind of living.Yet the ""business"" is messy - the hijackers are frightened and disorganized and time is running out. A U.S. Navy ship is on its way and two of the hijackers are injured including a barefoot 16-year-old who has lacerated his feet on broken glass. The hijackers make a decision to abandon the Alabama and take the captain with them to hold him hostage.The final act takes place inside an orange spheroid lifeboat where Phillips held for ransom and the four men are attempting to sail for the Somali coast. The tension ratchets up even further. Conditions inside are suffocatingly hot. The hijackers are almost hysterical and the American military is closing in. Night falls and with it the inevitable end game of this misguided venture. The rescue by faceless forces who fall from the skies and surround the bobbling ball of a life raft is startling only because the resolution comes so close to going horribly wrong.The coup de grace here is Greengrasss ending and its unexpected stress not on power but frailty. The emotional punch comes not with the catharsis of thriller but the empathetic image of a man on the brink of emotional collapse.

Director Paul Greengrass and screenwriter Billy Ray have taken Capt. Richard Phillips 2010 memoir -- ""A Captains Duty Somali Pirates Navy SEALS and Dangerous Days at Sea"" co-written with Stephan Talty -- and broadened and deepened its cultural lessons. In 2009 after the Kenya-bound cargo ship was boarded by four Somali pirates Phillips was taken hostage. Crafted with a precision at once machine-like and seemingly improvisational ""Captain Phillips"" is riveting and pensive. Hanks Everyman qualities serve his character especially well. He has moments of human-scale heroism and just-as-believable scenes of distress. Abdis turn as Muse a young man who seeks opportunity in crime is striking for its avoidance of sentimentality or villainy. From the moment he fights to captain a skiff for a warlord Muse eludes easy pegging. Director of two quite successful Jason Bourne spy flicks Greengrass has made popcorn movies that come with ethical tensions that distinguish them from most blockbusters. With his two post-9/11 films ( ""United 93"" and ""Green Zone"") he traversed the turf of documentaries with action-flick vigor. ""Captain Phillips"" is his best work yet in mixing propulsive energy with political and ethical quandaries about what it means to live and act in a world of steady conflicts. A former documentarian Greengrass pays special heed to the details of the ship. Cameras scan the metal machinery of the Maersk Alabama. This scrutiny sets a subtle tone. The ship is huge. Bigger still is the machinery of the marketplace it operates in. Meanwhile the void of a failed state is a fertile haven for conscripting young men into criminal enterprises. This is no David vs. Goliath yarn. Even though the conglomerates moving goods around the globe are gargantuan the aims of the pirates are hardly righteous. Nor are they driven by ideology. ""No al-Qaeda here. Just business"" Muse tells Phillips early in the hijacking. ""Captain Phillips"" puts names and faces to its tale of economic clashes. Thats why Hanks and Abdis performances are so anchoring. Their characters face off negotiate cajole each other not as archetypes but as humans. Even so the filmmakers will remind us while the two may not be cogs they are acted upon as much as they act. Only none of us ever wants to feel that puny in the world. Not a young fisherman in a Somalian village. Not a merchant marine lifer with a wife in Vermont. Not the audience for their stories. Its hardly a spoiler to say the cavalry arrives in the form of the logistically gifted Navy and its SEALs. And their intervention does lead to one of the most touchingly human moments were likely to witness on screen this season. But the filmmakers have taken exquisite care to take the story deeper than that rescue.

The film is based on the true story of Capt. Richard Phillips. VPC Claudia Puig USA TODAY 928 p.m. EDT October 10 2013Tom Hanks the ideal on-screen Everyman intensifies the sense of authenticity in this taut relentless and riveting story of survival against terrible odds.Tom Hanks center stars in the high-seas hijacking drama Captain Phillips.(Photo Sony/Columbia Pictures)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review 1/2 out of fourStars Tom Hanks Barkhad Abdi Barkhad Abdirahman Catherine KeenerRated PG-13; Runtime 2 hours 14 minutes; Opens Friday nationwide 167 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 6 COMMENTEMAILMOREIt takes a particularly agile director to helm a movie set on the roiling high seas and its additionally tricky to make a riveting thriller about a real-life event where the outcome is known.But its not surprising that Paul Greengrass who directed such suspenseful films as The Bourne Supremacyand United 93 could enthrall audiences with Captain Phillips (1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide) his harrowing account of the 2009 hijacking of the American freighter Maersk Alabama by Somali pirates.While told from the perspective of the ships captain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) it does not ignore the desperate situation that drove four Somali men to climb aboard the ship and demand great quantities of cash.Hanks deftly captures Phillips blend of bravery heroism and abject terror in a wonderfully minimalist performance one of his best.Greengrass is a masterful action director adept at keeping audiences off balance and on edge with his rapid hand-held camera moves brisk pacing and quick edits. He also knows how to take ripped-from-the-headlines incidents and re-create them with striking verisimilitude. Audiences feel thrust into the heart of the action.PREMIERE Hanks launches Captain Phillips at London Film FestivalREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersBy focusing on the edgy relationship between Phillips and Somali pirate Muse (Barkhad Abdi) Greengrass personalizes a terrifying experience. No simple bandit Muse may be a reluctant villain at the mercy of a vicious warlord but his despair makes him all the more ruthless. Muse and Phillips are pawns of a sort victims of global economic forces beyond their control. The pirates see U.S. cargo ships as floating islands of prosperity. Scenes on a war-torn Somali beach showing hopeless fishermen-turned-pirates are chaotic but illustrative.Crew members are almost sitting ducks hampered by being aboard an enormous un-armed commercial vessel (firearms were forbidden on commercial cargo ships per international maritime law). Though only four in number the pirates have a lethal advantage automatic weapons. The ships crew can only feebly fend off the marauders by spraying water hoses.Piloting a cargo ship from Oman to Kenya Phillips is a veteran sailor and no-nonsense Vermonter big on following established procedures. When the pirates make their way onto his ship he is decisive and quick-thinking. A scene in which the intruders try to track down the crew (hidden per Phillips plan) is extremely tense.The film glosses over why ships were sent knowingly into such dangerous waters with so little protection in the first place. While the film still works without this context it would have been better with it. (Billy Rays script is based on a book written by Phillips and Stephan Talty.)Somali-born Abdis portrayal of Muse is terrific but the film belongs to Hanks. So much hinges on his earnest Everyman performance as his character spends several days as a hostage inside a claustrophobic lifeboat. When an American military aircraft carrier arrives the pirates grow increasingly frantic. As they bicker among themselves they become all the more fearsome and unpredictable.The climactic rescue by Navy SEALs is riveting. But its Phillips devastating after-the-fact shock that leaves the most haunting impression in this ambitious taut and captivating thriller. 167 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 6 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1g45BQsFall Movies Calendar OctoberTake a look at the films heading to the box office this October.

Grade A+ No one working in movies today does fervid visceral realism better than director Paul Greengrass who made ""Bloody Sunday"" and ""United 93"" as well as the two best Bourne movies (""Supremacy"" and ""Ultimatum""). In ""Captain Phillips"" he tops himself. He marries the prickling intensity and spontaneity of fly-on-the-wall journalism with the sweep of epic filmmaking. His magnetic account of how Somali pirates hijacked the American cargo ship Maersk Alabama in April 2009 and held its captain Richard Phillips hostage draws you into the heart and soul of its multifaceted title character. The films unique kinetic intimacy makes you feel as if youre thinking on your toes along with the shrewd courageous skipper. Through his sharpshooters selection of images Greengrass turns the Somalis chasing and boarding of the Maersk and the captivity of Captain Phillips inside out. The director roots the film in Phillips point of view. We feel how high the stakes are for him as he uses guile to protect his crew. The mid-section is a titanic bout of cat-and-mouse. Phillips and his men exploit their knowledge of the ship and their confidence in each other as they strive to keep the pirates from taking control of the ship. When the action closes in on Phillips and hes alone with the pirates on a small enclosed lifeboat it grows even more intense. Its a test of strength and character for an exhausted captain who may be better at saving other merchant mariners than he is at saving himself. Greengrass stages the movie on a spectacular scale. Early on he gives us an indelible view of a chaotic Somali town and later he cuts to brisk scenes of Navy men conferring on a rescue plan warships surrounding the lifeboat that contains Phillips and the pirates and a SEAL team setting up a kill plan. But what supplies the film with its pulsing heart and consciousness is Greengrass inspired collaboration with Tom Hanks. They take us inside a decent embattled mans conscience. In Phillips own memoir ""A Captains Duty"" written with Stephen Talty the seasoned merchant mariner says he learned ""the value of trying to see things through other peoples eyes."" Hanks makes this empathy charismatic. From the beginning Greengrass gears his cameras to his stars expressive body language and eloquent glance whether hes saying goodbye with banked emotion to his wife Adele (Catherine Keener) before he takes his flight to West Africa or signaling his concern over the Maersks lax security to his first mate (Shane Murphy). Hanks has never been more forceful or subtle vocally and in every other way than he is as Phillips. Its as if mastering the mans New England accent (Phillips grew up in Massachusetts and lives in Vermont) has given Hanks a fresh emotional register. His clipped way of saying ""enjoy your coffee men"" measures the genial distance he maintains from his crew. They grumble about sailing through pirate-infested waters - and then perform superbly under pressure. The audio commands and subtle cues Phillips gives them by radio as they hide from the pirates amount to a virtuoso demonstration of the power of inflection. Hanks Phillips knows the sweat and skill that go into being a capable able-bodied seaman and the spine it takes to be a leader. Thats why he recognizes the capacity for command in the pirate leader Muse (Barkhad Abdi). Phillips and Muse lock eyes before the pirate comes into his cabin and once he gets there Muse announces hes the captain now. The pair share a flickering intuitive bond. Intelligence and passion streak through Abdis eyes even when Muse and his men are high on the amphetamine-like effects of khat a shrub whose leaves the pirates chew on constantly to sustain their wild-eyed aggression. Phillips appreciates Muses human substance no matter how vile and wrongheaded his actions. Their connection is a tribute to Hanks and Abdi a Somali from Minneapolis who never acted before. Abdis Muse has enough longing for legitimacy to explain himself to Phillips. Muse says theyre fishermen who must resort to hijacking because Western fleets have scooped up the riches of their fishing routes. Phillips isnt buying it. He insists there must be other choices for Muse besides taking hostages. The pirate replies ""Maybe in America."" But Phillips wont accept that statement and the movie doesnt take it at face value. This action film sets off human and political reverberations because the director and his cast and crew work with instinctive unity. You cant help feeling that Hanks has borrowed some of his characters generous sensibility from Greengrass. After all this is a director who shows that Somali pirates are pressed into service -- warlords expect them to extort millions from international shipping companies. (When they realize the Maersk is an American ship they think theyve hit the jackpot.) The high-minded Danish fiction film ""A Hijacking"" which superbly rendered the tense ransom negotiation between a shipping companys CEO and similar Somali pirates avoided ""conventional"" pirate scenes. Greengrass demonstrates with gusto how a gifted director can find meaning and feeling in moments of high-seas adventure. He cunningly contrasts the pirates tiny fast boat with the enormous cargo ship and its towers of cartons - a floating symbol of American consumerism (though its carrying humanitarian supplies). And Hanks face reflects his growing comprehension of his enemies guts raw skill and scary desperation. Phillips book contains several movie references including a couple to John Wayne. Under the gun of his most volatile captor Phillips recalls a line in ""The Searchers"" when Wayne declares ""Some men need killing."" But Phillips also mocks the guy ""whos seen just one too many John Wayne movies and wants to go toe to toe with the bastards."" In lesser hands ""Captain Phillips"" could have been that kind of John Wayne movie. Instead its a new kind of Tom Hanks movie - exciting unsentimental and profoundly moving.

"Captain Phillips (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Captain Phillips (PG-13) Tom Hanks delivers career-high work in this fact-based account of the hijacking of an American cargo ship. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com10/10/2013 Editor rating 3.5 In Captain Phillips director Paul Greengrass pulls off the same remarkable feat he accomplished with United 93 He takes a true story in which the outcome is already known and transforms it into a gripping wrenching devastating thriller. This one plays like an enormous punch to the gut. The movie is based on Richard Phillips book-length account of the 2009 hijacking of the Maersk Alabama cargo ship by Somali pirates the first such attack on a U.S. vessel in 200 years. But although the scenario might seem limited in dramatic potential screenwriter Billy Ray (Shattered Glass State of Play) takes a journalistic approach to the story turning it into a procedural in which every detail contributes to the whole the way the ragtag group of pirates comes together; the day-to-day operations of the mammoth ship; the limited resources Phillips had to defend his boat against an attack and the ingenious tactics he employed in order to save his crew. Like United 93 Captain Phillips doesnt take political sides. Greengrass approaches the story from the center out showing instead of telling and focusing on the humanity of its protagonists instead of their ideals. The movie allows us to interpret everyones actions instead of telling us what to think and how to feel about them. We come to understand why the skinny Muse (the terrific Barkhad Abdi) the leader of the four-man pirate gang feels justified in trying to rob the cargo ship (hes a small-time fisherman who resents big corporations draining the resources of the African coast; hes resentful of what he perceives to be American imperialism). We learn exactly how a few armed men on a rickety speedboat could manage to board and commandeer such an enormous craft. And through Tom Hanks remarkable performance as the eponymous protagonist we experience the constant rush of emotions the by-the-book captain felt from dread to fear desperation to panic despair to hopelessness. Hanks has entered a stage in his career where we take him for granted. Hes a reliably warm and funny presence (Larry Crowne Extremely Loud amp; Incredibly Close) who occasionally takes show-off look-at-me chances (Cloud Atlas) that dont amount to much. But in Captain Phillips Hanks delivers his subtlest most internalized performance to date. Phillips is an experienced sailor a pragmatic man who believes in procedure and routine. When hes thrust into a situation where the normal rules no longer apply he has to relearn everything he knows and try to deal with captors who have impossible expectations and place a much lesser value on human life than he does. Hanks allows you to watch this man react to extreme circumstances and respond the best he can. A big part of the films considerable suspense comes in seeing what Phillips will try next even after hes been trapped into the tightest corner imaginable. Greengrass tones down his trademark shaky-cam style just enough that you can always follow the action although the handheld camerawork still makes you feel like youre living the movie along with its characters. The movies first scene is so clunky -- Phillips ride to the airport with his wife (Catherine Keener sporting a horrible frizzy-hair wig) during which they talk about how much the world has changed and how much better things used to be -- that you brace yourself for a disaster. But by the time Captain Phillips reaches its stunning final scene which manages to be happy and emotionally devastating at the same time even that horrible opening makes sense. Ive purposely avoiding recounting what happens in Captain Phillips because even though the story is well-known the movie plays even better if youre not familiar with the facts. But Greengrass treatment of this material -- and Hanks extraordinary performance -- makes the movie required viewing for the informed and uninformed alike.

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe Review Captain Phillips Tom Hanks and the Pirates of the Somali Coast The two-time Oscar winner plays a real-life American hero in Paul Greengrasss pounding jittery docudrama By Richard Corliss Oct. 10 2013 Share Read Later Send to Kindle Columbia Pictures Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture The most shocking moment in Captain Phillips which re-creates the ordeal of a freighter captain kidnapped by Somali pirates comes in the very first shot an exterior of Phillips Vermont home for which the camera is perfectly still. This is a film by Paul Greengrass director of two Bourne movies and the high lama of queasy-cam cinema. Did Greengrass undergo a late conversion to cinema classicism where the camera rests on a tripod and audiences neednt take Dramamine before entering the theater? Nope. Greengrass is back to his old shake-n-break games by the time Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) and his wife (Catherine Keener) drive from their home to the Burlington airport; their conversation is filmed in alternating closeups that let viewers count the actors pores like a dermatologist with a magnifying glass. Phillips is to take a flight to East Africa to pilot the container ship M.V. Maersk Alabama toward a rendezvous with international piracy. There the directorial point of view alternates between macro and micro helicopter views of the Gulf of Aden and the jittery closeups of a documentary cameraman dancing barefoot on hot coals while trying to keep the action in focus. (MORE Richard Corliss on Paul Greengrasss The Bourne Ultimatum) The action ought to be plenty exciting and it often is. Anxiety surely seized the sailors of any vessel plying those waters in 2009. Somalia which on maps looks like the rhino nose guard on the Horn of Africa had been host to hundreds of acts of piracy and kidnappings that netted the perps 80 million in ransom the year before. The Somali civil war had led to the disbanding of the countrys navy leaving maritime commerce in the gulf essentially unprotected. So the crew of the Alabama knew they could be sailing into trouble. Phillips story is well-known it was reported in TIME and other media as it unfolded over five April days and for anyone not following the news then has been in every recent story on the movie. So its not a spoiler to say that Phillips survived the escapade and wrote a book about it. A piece on CBS Sunday Morning reveals that the real captain doesnt speak in the broad Yankee accent that Hanks sometimes assumes and that he looks like a cross between fellow New Englander Stephen King (whose father was a merchant seaman) and George Clooney who was otherwise engaged shooting Gravity a similar tale of a man whose job puts him in danger far from home but one which is set in space not on the sea. (MORE Why Gravity Is a Vision of the Future of Movies) Richard Phillips calm tough demeanor and the flinty resolve he displayed in protecting his crew make him a good fit for Hanks who in many films (including his own astronaut gig Apollo 13) has played the competent ordinary guy whom dire circumstances force into extraordinary valor. He was stranded offshore before too in the 2000 Cast Away. But that trauma was a stroll on the beach next to his face-off with Muse (Barkhad Abdi) the Somali pirate who commandeers the Alabama points a gun in Phillips face and says ""Im the captain now."" The interplay between Phillips and Muse duplicates the elemental tension of any western confrontation peaceful hero vs. armed villain. But it does cause a viewer to wonder why when the Alabama crew members first saw the tiny pirate skiff overtaking their huge ship they didnt follow the great American tradition of taking out their rifles and shooting the invaders. As members of the Seafarers International Union Phillips real-life mates had received small-arms training for just such an emergency. Yet Billy Rays screenplay shows them using only the ships hoses in an attempt to flood the skiff and repel the pirates. Does an Americans right to bear arms not extend to an American ship traveling through hostile waters? (Thats not a rhetorical question; I cant explain it.) (LIST Richard Phillips on TIMEs Top 10 Heroes List of 2009) Many of the pirates had been fishermen and some Somalis have insisted that foreign ships poisoned the fish by dumping toxic waste in the water. Poverty and revenge may have given incentive to the young men whom Abdi and the other excellent Somali actors portray as teens driven less by greed than desperate bravado. They are lost boys trying to play Peter Pan or in a pinch Captain Hook. When they take Phillips hostage in a lifeboat and are later surrounded by the U.S. Navy and a SEALs contingent hungry for a Zero Dark Watery adventure the young renegades resourcefulness turns into cluelessness and Phillips has the feeling hes inside a collective mind verging on madness. Shaky-cam complaints aside Greengrass is a master at managing complicated activity with docudrama urgency. He proved that in United 93 (2006) the tick-tock thriller about passengers on a hijacked 9/11 flight and more fancifully in the 2010 Green Zone set in the first months of the U.S. invasion of Iraq which turned Matt Damon into a kind of Bourne in Baghdad. (Both films graced TIMEs Top 10 Movies lists of their respective years.) Creating zigzag lines of screen conflict Greengrass floods the moviegoers eye with enormous amounts of assimilable detail. Those gifts are on offer here too but in a scenario lacking in suspense. You wait not for Phillips to be saved but for the young pirates to crack. They are four kids in a lifeboat against the worlds most powerful navy. Whats at stake is the boys doom not the captains life. (MORE Subscribe to TIME for Reviews of United 93 and Green Zone) Hanks has a wonderful scene late in the film that shows a strong man collapsing into frailty. It hints at the emotional depth the movie might have plundered. The rest of Captain Phillips must rely for its drive on the relentless mechanical agitation of Henry Jackmans score. It cant save an overly muscled docudrama that is more pounding that truly gripping.

For the man whose container ship was hijacked by Somali pirates in 2009 going to sea was like going to prison with a strong chance of dying. His story is extraordinary and its told by two perfectly matched collaborators-- Tom Hanks the Hollywood embodiment of American decency and self-effacing courage and Paul Greengrass the virtuoso director of action adventures with a documentary feel and a fidelity to facts. The film succeeds on its own terms--an exciting entertainment that makes us feel good about the outcome and about the reach of American power rather than its limits. Yet the narrative container is far from full. There isnt enough incident or complexity to sustain the entire length of this elaborately produced star vehicle. Watch a clip for the film ""Captain Phillips."" Tom Hanks plays Captain Richard Phillips who in real life sacrificed himself to save his ships crew during a Somali pirate hijacking in 2009. (Photo/Video Columbia Pictures) The story starts with its instantly appealing hero leaving home in Vermont-- Catherine Keener plays his wife--to go to work off the coast of Somalia. Rich Phillips is appealing not only because hes played by Mr. Hanks but because hes a high-tech globalized version of a venerable archetype the quietly competent Yankee seafarer. Its fascinating to follow him aboard his vessel the Maersk Alabama as he takes command of the huge thing but his comfortingly familiar routines dont last for long. A collision lies ahead--not with a ship but with a third-world culture represented by new versions of the corsair archetype four young desperados with deadly weapons at least one of them tech-savvy and all of them determined to make a killing that will in the best case be purely monetary. The leader of the Somalis who board the Alabama from a scruffy skiff comes to be called Skinny--Skeletal wouldnt have had the same ring. Hes played with such ferocious charisma that its almost impossible to believe that Somalia-born Barkhad Abdi who lives in Minnesota is making his acting debut in the role. (Mr. Greengrass also excels at directing actors.) Skinny insists that the raid is ""just business--we want money; when everybody paid we go home."" He also insists that he and his cohorts are fishermen whove been driven to crime by the predatory practices of Western fishing fleets. It may be more complicated than that even if Billy Rays script chooses not to explore the complications. But whoever Skinny may be hes a captain too and the films dramatic core--as distinct from its much hotter action core--concerns the two mens struggle for dominance and for control of a ship being held for ransom. Phillips tests prods and observes his rival shrewdly. He is by turns affable and tough fearless while appropriately fearful. The Somali is fearless too but with dangerous displays of bravado. Having taken Phillips hostage hes unfazed by the prospect of taking on America as well. All of this is suspenseful as far as it goes but it cant go further because in an odd way the film has fallen hostage to its own integrity. Apart from the inevitable telescoping and heightening for dramatic purposes plus some minor--and in a couple of cases foolish--spasms of invented heroics ""Captain Phillips"" hews fairly closely to the events set forth in the book. The movie is essentially what it claims to be based on a true story that happens to culminate in a display of U.S. naval power and Navy SEAL expertise. ( Barry Ackroyd did the spectacular cinematography. The film was edited by Christopher Rouse.) That sets it in sharp contrast to a recent film on the same subject one that is not coincidentally coming out next week on DVD and Blu-ray. Tobias Lindholms ""A Hijacking"" from Denmark in Danish English and Somali is a fiction film that barely registered as a blip on the scope of the international movie market. Yet ""A Highjacking"" is wonderfully dramatic in its interweaving of disparate elements--enthralling characters; intricate negotiations with startlingly sophisticated pirates; explorations of geopolitics and corporate imperatives; and through it all a question of life or death thats answered from the start in ""Captain Phillips"" a Hollywood action adventure with a beloved star in the title role. I mention the Danish film not to suggest what ""Captain Phillips"" should have been but to suggest why it is what it is. The script was based on a book that doesnt lack for personal heroism or a thrilling climax. But the book recounts a string of factual events that by their repetitive nature lack the density of first-rate fiction. Thats why the film plods along so perplexingly while the pirates search the Alabama from top to bottom for its apparently vanished crew; why its portraits of the pirates are as shallow as they are striking and why so much time is given over to the pirates yelling and screaming at Rich Phillips or at each other. It also sheds light on why Mr. Hankss most powerful scene--youll know it when you see it--is in fact a piece of fiction. Thats not a bad thing mind you but a good thing. Its based on true feelings. Watch a clip from the film ""A River Changes Course."" Filmmaker Kalyanee Mam travels to her homeland to capture the stories of three Cambodians struggling to maintain their way of life while the modern world closes in around them. (Photo Migrant Films) A River Changes Course Ever so calmly sometimes languorously Kalyanee Mams documentary feature reveals the anguishing sense of loss behind a profusion of ravishingly beautiful images. Ms. Mam was born in Cambodia during the Khmer Rouge regime; she and her family fled that shattered nations refugee camps and emigrated to the U.S. where she was educated became a lawyer and a gifted cinematographer. In recent years she has returned to her homeland several times to film ""A River Changes Course."" Beautiful images can be a distraction in a serious documentary but thats hardly the case here. They draw us in so we can better understand the hurtling changes that endanger the future of Cambodia and by extension much of the developing world. The story is told through three families connected only by pressures they understand imperfectly if at all. Khieu Mok and her mother cultivate rice in a small village outside the capital Phnom Penh. Mired in debt theyre forced to borrow more money to buy a buffalo and additional land that they need to survive. Sari Math and his family live in a floating village on central Cambodias Tonle Sap River. Hes forced to quit school and go to work when the familys livelihood is threatened by dwindling catches that result from large fish traps they cant afford and by the proliferation of illegal fishing. Sav Samourn and her family live high in the remote mountains of northeast Cambodia in what could pass for a jungle Eden--butterflies orchids cashew orchards rice paddies dense forest--except that the forests are being devoured by corporate loggers. Ms. Mam follows these families and their distinctive ways of life with her eyes wide open. Whats so unusual about her approach is that she sees just as clearly as an artist a journalist and a de facto anthropologist. (Her film is enhanced by David Mendezs haunting music.) ENLARGE Khieu Mok in A River Changes Course Film Collaborative The pastoral and littoral scenes are lovely but the loveliness masks a degrading environment. The childrens faces are photographed luminously but the kids well-being is shadowed by pollution and the lure of urbanization. Khieu who goes to work in a Phnom Penh garment factory thinks of herself as ""divided in half."" She fantasizes that someone will bring employment to her village by building a factory but that the village will somehow remain unspoiled an idyllic idealization of Phnom Penh. Sav has an undivided fear of what has already happened and whats to come. ""Before"" she says of her cherished surroundings ""we wouldnt dare walk through here. There were tigers bears and elephants. Now all the wild animals are gone. Were no longer afraid of wild animals and ghosts. Now were afraid of people. The elders say theyre afraid of people cutting down the forests."" Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download ENLARGE Bloody Sunday (2002) An air of fatefulness suffuses ""Bloody Sunday"" Paul Greengrasss stunning re-creation of the day in September 1972 when 13 unarmed civilians were killed by British soldiers during a peace march in Northern Ireland. Thirty years later the bloodbath is still surrounded by controversy so the film cant be taken as a definitive factual account. Yet it makes a powerful case for the contention that 3000 British paratroopers presumably sent to keep the peace were looking for a fight when they arrived and that their contingency plan was nothing more than a sequence of ghastly blunders waiting to happen. ENLARGE The Bourne Supremacy (2004) For his Hollywood debut Paul Greengrass directed this impressive sequel in which Matt Damons haunted assassin Jason Bourne is still trying to figure out who he is. He starts out in Goa a photogenic state on the western coast of India and he remains on the goa from start to finish. The movie keeps you in a state of reasonably contented attentiveness. Still the nonstop action reminded me of George Carlins alarmed response to the ticket agent who tells him hes on a nonstop flight. At some point you yearn for solid ground. ENLARGE United 93 (2006) ""Captain Phillips"" isnt Paul Greengrasss first fact-inspired film about a hijacking. Five years after the fact he directed this literally spellbinding vision of what happened on the ground as the twin towers of the World Trade Center were struck and what may have happened in the cockpit and cabin of the hijacked airliner that was diverted by a passenger revolt from its flight path to the U.S. Capitol. The filmmakers mosaic--and lapidary--technique is similar to the one he employed in ""Bloody Sunday."" It worked superbly then and just as superbly here.

Cathy Kanavy/Bleecker Street Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. By Ann Hornaday October 10 2013 Follow AnnHornaday Those readers who habitually skip past the review to see how many stars a movie has earned might be muttering to themselves about now Didnt she just give four stars to ""Gravity""? Now ""Captain Phillips""? Has she gone that soft? No the movies have gotten that good. ""Captain Phillips"" a taut finely crafted superbly acted maritime thriller is just one of a wave of fabulous films heading our way. Its autumn my friends a time of falling leaves and soaring cinematic standards. Hallelujah and pass the buttered popcorn. The two principal artists involved with ""Captain Phillips"" go a long way in explaining why it works so well Paul Greengrass the exacting British director behind such masterpieces as ""Bloody Sunday"" and ""United 93"" -- as well as a couple of movies with the name ""Bourne"" in the title -- is behind the camera. Tom Hanks -- who needs no introduction -- is in front of it in this case playing a modest hard-nosed merchant mariner who in 2009 was hijacked and kidnapped by Somali criminals while his ship was delivering commercial goods water food and fuel to Kenya. As ""Captain Phillips"" opens Richard Phillips is driving from his pretty Vermont farmhouse to the airport chatting with his wife Andrea (Catherine Keener) who sends him off with a perfunctory ""Have a safe trip."" It wont be as anyone knows who recalls the harrowing five-day ordeal of the real-life Capt. Phillips who calmly ensured the safety of his crew and then continued to keep his wits about him while being held captive in a cramped lifeboat. ""Captain Phillips"" is based on his memoir of the event which was widely reported in newspapers and on television. But Greengrass and screenwriter Billy Ray (""Shattered Glass"") go one step further introducing viewers to the poverty desperation and cynicism that converge to lead four Somali fishermen to go to work for a warlord attacking container ships and absconding with their cargo. High on khat and armed to the teeth the particular thieves in question are led by a charismatic young man named Muse (the terrific newcomer Barkhad Abdi) who once he boards the enormous Maersk Alabama vies with Phillips for control. ""Im the captain now"" he declares at one point. Once again collaborating with cinematographer Barry Ackroyd Greengrass hews to a familiar visual style immersing viewers in the rhythms of Phillipss day and familiarizing them with the labyrinthine vessel that doesnt resemble a boat as much as a vast floating office. (Like Peter Weirs ""Master and Commander"" ""Captain Phillips"" offers a fascinating tutorial in the humming hive-like organization of a working sea craft.) Once two tiny skiffs show up -- first as a radar blip then as bobbing barely distinct omens of oncoming danger -- the filmmakers keep ""Captain Phillips"" on its even keel allowing the tension to ratchet up organically rather than by way of self-conscious editing or manipulative music cues. What larger messages ""Captain Phillips"" conveys -- about globalization consumerism and the clash of radically different supply chains -- are delivered deftly rather than with ham-handed polemic; the fact that Phillips was delivering food aid to Africa may be seen by some as a grievous irony and by others as a cruel case study in how foreign aid exacerbates dependence and poverty throughout the continent. Greengrasss straightforward style not only keeps ""Captain Phillips"" from didacticism but it also is perfectly suited to its protagonist -- a bespectacled by-the-book guy who runs a tight ship literally and metaphorically. Hanks who has made something of an art of playing real-life characters submerges his usual Everyman charm and instead plays up his Everyman blandness allowing Phillipss sober quick-thinking character to emerge through behavior rather than stirring speeches or swashbuckling set pieces. The result is a study in movement and action that is as purely cinematic as ""Gravity"" a film that may be more far-reaching in its location and visuals but portrays isolation dire straits and the wages of Manifest Destiny with similar white-knuckled intensity. ""Captain Phillips"" is such an impressive dramatic achievement that it comes as a shock when it gets even better during a devastating final scene in which Hanks single-handedly dismantles Hollywood notions of macho heroism in one shattering virtually wordless sequence. That moment as purely emotional as what went before has been kinetic makes ""Captain Phillips"" yet another Greengrass masterpiece. And it reveals why there have been so many Behind the directors dispassionate unfailingly rigorous lens lies an enormous unfailingly compassionate heart.     PG-13. At area theaters. Contains sustained intense sequences of menace some violence with bloody images and substance use. 130 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Faysal Ahmed left and Tom Hanks star in Columbia Pictures ""Captain Phillips."" Photo -- Captain Phillips review real-life terror 1 / 6 Back to Gallery Captain Phillips Drama. Starring Tom Hanks and Barkhad Abdi. Directed by Paul Greengrass. (PG-13. 134 minutes.) ""Captain Phillips"" is another highlight in Tom Hanks Americana gallery the story of a seemingly regular guy who turns out to be something more than a regular guy thus giving hope to regular guys everywhere. Specifically this is the true story of Richard Phillips an American merchant seaman who spent several of the tensest days imaginable locked in a struggle with Somali pirates in 2009. If you remember the news accounts you remember the outcome (you wont hear about it here). Yet theres a big difference between knowing about something and experiencing it. In ""Captain Phillips"" director Paul Greengrass gets viewers to a place where they feel it - enough that they appreciate what Phillips went through and yet only so much that they can stand it. This is an intense and complicated story and the film doesnt rush it. It lets it unfold and build methodically. In the process the audience learns things about commercial shipping something most of us have never thought about. For example there are no weapons on those boats - at least there were none on the Alabama Maersk which Phillips piloted - not a torpedo not a machine gun nothing. And so when Phillips (Hanks) looks and sees two tiny motorboats pop up on the radar going fast and heading in his direction he is more than concerned. But he doesnt panic. ""Captain Phillips"" was guaranteed to be a gripping chronicle no matter what because what happened was so remarkable. But beyond the bare events theres also Phillips himself who found himself in a predicament demanding that he be smart shrewd and beyond-belief brave moment by moment for days in the face of imminent mortal danger. When another person might have been scared out of his wits Phillips had to be brilliant. He had to look the pirates straight in the face and lie to them - and get them to believe him when they expected lies. So Phillips is not just somebody who had something extraordinary happen to him. Hes an extraordinary person in his own right. That as much as anything else makes ""Captain Phillips"" more than a very adept thriller but rather a tale of character under pressure the portrait of someone who gradually inspires awe. Four Somali pirates board the ship and the one in charge announces ""No al Qaeda here just business."" When the pirates discover that theyve taken an American ship they break into smiles. Its one of the unexpected undercurrents of ""Captain Phillips"" - the weird affection the pirates seem to have for the United States which to them is synonymous with glamour wealth and good times - all the things theyre after. And so it begins Phillips must deal with four men carrying machine guns whose culture he doesnt understand and who are all chewing khat a plant that creates a sense of aggression and euphoria. Only one of the men speaks enough English that a conversation is possible and that man as played by Barkhad Abdi is ruthless and alert to any hint of dissembling. Good acting doesnt happen in a vacuum. Abdis fierceness and odd sensitivity helps bring out of Hanks a signature performance. True Hanks New England accent sounds like hes just talking funny and going in Hanks has an innate advantage - the movie stars magic gift for inciting empathy just by standing there. But Hanks transparency is something brilliant. His face is so easy to read that we not only get his emotions but also the complexity of his thinking. At one point for example he knows these pirates are finished that theyre going to be either dead or imprisoned that there is absolutely no way out for them. And he just sits in dread of their realizing it. Likewise his depiction of a man in a state of traumatic shock must go down as one of this actors best moments on screen. Director Greengrass likes the handheld camera and likes to move it around but hes an artist not merely jittery. The cutting the camera work and the pace all work in support of the mood hes building one of gradual and increasing tension to the point that it becomes almost unbearable - and then a little beyond.

"Captain Phillips starring Tom Hanks reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Captain Phillips Is Not Your Run-of-the-Mill Maritime Action Thriller Captain Phillips Is Not Your Run-of-the-Mill Maritime Action Thriller Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 10 2013 717 PM Captain Phillips Oscar ho By Dana Stevens Tom Hanks and Barkhad Abdirahman in Captain Phillips. Photo by Jasin Boland/Columbia Pictures Industries Inc. After youve seen Captain Phillips come back and listen to Slates Spoiler Special with Dana Stevens and David Weigel. You can also download the podcast here. The defining scene of Paul Greengrass Captain Phillips occurs in the last few minutes after the cargo-ship captain of the title played by Tom Hanks has survived his ordeal of being taken hostage on a lifeboat by four Somali pirates off the coast of Africa. It isnt spoiling anything to note that the captain makes it off the lifeboat alive--after all the real-life Richard Phillips went on to write a book about the harrowing 2009 hijacking of his ship upon which this movie (written by Billy Ray of Shattered Glass and The Hunger Games) is based. But the way Greengrass treats the moment is something I wont spoil except to say that this last scene exemplifies the compassion and truthfulness that sets this movie apart from your run-of-the-mill maritime action thriller (and that it very well may be the reason Tom Hanks wins an Oscar). Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Advertisement That powerful last scene had its work cut out for it in my case because by the time it rolled around I was starting to lose patience with Captain Phillips the second half of which takes place almost entirely in a claustrophobic enclosed lifeboat. Greengrass has an impressive gift for creating tension with his trademark documentary-style shaky camera (here wielded by frequent Greengrass collaborator Barry Ackroyd) but hes not always so great at diffusing that tension or modulating its rhythms over the course of a film (which is part of why I sat through his 9/11 re-creation United 93 with an uneasy combination of anguish and boredom). That second hour in the lifeboat suspenseful as it is makes for a long stretch of uninterrupted intensity especially when filmed in Greengrass jolting quick-cut style. Its effective on a visceral level but so unvaryingly clamorous and chaotic that I for one found myself at times as eager to get out of the movie as Captain Phillips was to get off the boat. The rescue operation is staged with great skill and tension (and even rare for Paul Greengrass the occasional stationary establishing shot). The first hour is much more effectively paced even if theres something off about the opening scene in which Phillips and his wife (Catherine Keener) have a curiously programmatic chat about the economically unstable world their children are growing up into. The thematic import of that conversation becomes clear in the next scene as a group of desperate young Somali fishermen haggle with a warlord for a place on the crew of the next pirate expedition hes sending out. In addition to being an action-adventure about captors and hostages Captain Phillips is a tragedy about the ruinous consequences of global capitalism. The would-be pirates may have it unimaginably worse than the middle-class Phillipses but everyone we see onscreen is just a working man doing what he feels he has to do to get by. (And given that Keeners character disappears after that first scene never to be replaced by another female face I do mean ""he."") Once the pirates have boarded the Alabama though--in a staggering David-and-Goliath raid in which four scrawny Somalis in a broken-down skiff manage to breach the defenses of a massive American cargo ship on full alert--youll be too busy trying to catch a breath to pick up much political subtext. The head of the pirate crew is the hotheaded acutely status-conscious Muse (unforgettably embodied by Barkhad Abdi who was recruited from the Somali community of Minneapolis for his first film role). Captain Phillips on the other hand is a seasoned leader under pressure a fact Greengrass establishes with an admirably light touch--no sentimental heroics here just brisk pragmatism. He manages to warn most of his crew in time for them to hide in the engine room where he communicates with them by walkie-talkie from the bridge as he negotiates with the hijackers. In an agonizingly intense scene the frightened squabbling pirates force Phillips to take them on a tour of the ship slowly zeroing in on the place we know the entire crew is hiding. Eventually Phillips persuades the pirates to leave on a lifeboat with the 30000 from the ships safe. But the Somalis take him hostage resulting in an international incident that will entail the parachuting in of Navy SEALs. Although the pace flags as described above while were waiting for the SEALS to arrive the eventual rescue operation is staged with great skill and tension (and even rare for Greengrass the occasional stationary establishing shot). The scenes in which the hijackers meet their various fates--I wont spoil them if you dont remember the story but none are pleasant--have something of the feel of the raid on the Bin Laden compound in Zero Dark Thirty a taste of bitter ambivalent victory. And then comes that transcendent last scene in which the man whose side weve barely left during this incredible ordeal is suddenly revealed as the best kind of hero not super at all but ordinary and vulnerable and human.

"Review Captain Phillips a gripping game of cat and mouse - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Captain Phillips a gripping game of cat and mouse Review Captain Phillips Kenneth Turan reviews Captain Phillips starring Tom Hanks Catherine Keener and Max Martini. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews Captain Phillips starring Tom Hanks Catherine Keener and Max Martini. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic When Paul Greengrass directs a thoroughly dramatic tale based on true events and Tom Hanks takes on the title role you think you know what to expect. But just you wait -- the piercingly realistic ""Captain Phillips"" will exceed your expectations.The story of the six days that Richard Phillips captain of the cargo ship Maersk Alabama spent in April 2009 first trying to avoid a gang of Somali pirates and then as their restive captive this film does an impeccable job of creating and tightening the narrative screws. The result is so propulsive that you may find yourself looking at your watch not out of boredom but because youre not sure how much more tension you can stand. But ""Captain Phillips"" based on the real mans memoir is more than a reaffirmation of how good Greengrass responsible for both ""The Bourne Supremacy"" and ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is at the delicious mechanics of crackerjack storytelling.PHOTOS Tom Hanks | Career in pictures As written by Billy Ray who wrote and directed ""Shattered Glass"" this film has qualities we might not expect. This is a film with an emotional quotient that manages to combine the dynamics of human behavior under stress with our affinity for the nuts and bolts of realistic action.More than that harking back to ""Bloody Sunday"" Greengrass first international success and the film that revealed his gift for based-on-fact dramas  ""Captain Phillips"" has also managed to include some subtle but unmistakable social commentary that speaks the director has said ""to the larger forces shaping our world today."" Tense drama top acting topical relevance and thoroughgoing realism  this is a film that reminds us what weve been missing and does it all without breaking a sweat.That kind of involvement was a special challenge with a story whose every detail was covered to death by the major media. Greengrass made it happen with a canny mix of known unknown and completely inexperienced actors all of whom had to be broken into the directors very particular filmmaking style.PHOTOS Captain Phillips on screen and in real life Few actors are better known than two-time Oscar winner Hanks who after an unfortunate ""Cloud Atlas"" detour is back in his wheelhouse here as the above-average average man who possesses the kind of everyday heroism its easy to both identify with and believe in. As good as Hanks has been in the past there are moments here especially near the conclusion that are deeper and more emotional than anything weve seen from this actor before.Except for a brief cameo by Catherine Keener as the captains wife Andrea no one else in the almost exclusively male cast will be known to most moviegoers but this works to the films advantage by increasing believability across the board.This is especially the case with the quartet of Somali Americans -- all without acting experience and all discovered in the Minneapolis area by casting director Francine Maisler and her Minnesota colleague Debbie DeLisi -- who play the pirates who bedevil the Maersk Alabama. They are a sepulchral bunch thinner than thin every one and especially the leader Muse (Barkhad Abdi) and his enforcer Najee (Faysal Ahmed) initially looking scary enough to be capable of anything.Greengrass who had extensive documentary experience before turning to features likes to shoot in long unbroken sequences using two or three hand-held cameras a style he feels enhances the believability he is passionate about.NYFF 2013 Watch the trailers For that reason Hanks and the Somalis did not meet each other until the moment the pirates looking like men from another planet storm the Maersk Alabamas bridge. ""The verisimilitude was just incalculable"" Hanks comments in the press notes. ""The hair stood up on the back of our necks.""Before that ""when worlds collide"" moment both sides have been carefully introduced to us Phillips in some regular guy moments at his Vermont residence and the pirates in sequences not in the book in their home in the seaside town of Eyl Somalia.Its there that we get the crucial sense of why these men -- impoverished former fishermen without prospects and under the thumbs of armed and dangerous warlords -- do what they do. ""Captain Phillips"" in no way condones piratical behavior but it does want us to see the men as feeling trapped into roles they would not have otherwise chosen.As much a personality as any of the men is the Maersk Alabama an enormous 508-foot vessel capable of holding close to 1100 railroad car-sized containers. Greengrass a bear for authenticity moved the production to Malta to be able to shoot on the Maersk Alexander the Alabamas sister ship just as he moved everything to Norfolk Va. to get access to the appropriate U.S. Navy vessels.PHOTOS Celebrities by The TimesGreengrass regular cinematographer Barry Ackroyd outdid himself shooting vivid footage in the ships extremely confined spaces causing his director to comment ""I dont think he could have made this film if he didnt practice yoga.""The initial nautical chase is involving and it gets more so when the Somalis in the image that is the films poster art succeed in scaling the skyscraper-like side of the ship without aid of stuntmen or CGI. Once they take over the weaponless vessel the armed pirates begin an intricate game of cat and mouse with Captain Phillips that begins when Muse the only English speaker in the group announces ""Captain relax nobody gets hurt. No Al Qaeda here. Just business.""As the back and forth between Phillips and Muse continues through more tense permutations than it is possible to list -- one man determined to save and protect his crew the other focused on getting the payday this has all been about -- they come to have a wary and grudging kind of understanding of the profound ways their lives differ. All these strands come together when an exasperated Phillips says to Muse ""Theres gotta be something other than being a fisherman or kidnapping people"" and the Somali replies after a beat ""Maybe in America."" Its yet another moment to ponder and savor in this altogether exceptional film.Captain PhillipsMPAA rating PG-13 for sustained intense sequences of menace some violence with bloody images and for substance useRunning time 2 hours 14 minutesPlaying In general releasekenneth.turanlatimes.com    PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Tom Hanks Piracy Maersk Alabama Hijacking (2009) Reviews Lifestyle and Leisure Captain Phillips trailer Captain Phillips On screen and in real life On the Set Movies and TV Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad71deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-captain-phillips-movie-review-20131011,0,781246.story",200,captainphillips20,captainphillips,latimes

Columbia Pictures hide caption toggle caption Columbia Pictures In the emotionally fraught thriller Captain Phillips Tom Hanks plays the real-life freighter captain whose Maersk Alabama was overtaken by Somali pirates in 2009. Columbia Pictures Captain Phillips Director Paul Greengrass Genre Action drama Running Time 134 minutes Rated PG-13 for sustained intense sequences of menace some violence with bloody images and for substance use With Tom Hanks Barkhad Abdi Catherine Keener (Recommended) Before seeing Paul Greengrass nerve-wracking based-on-fact thriller Captain Phillips Id never been able to get my head around the logistics of Somali piracy. Enormous commercial freighters captured and held for ransom by tiny bands of pirates -- often teenagers -- who always seem to overtake the freighters on the high seas in fishing skiffs smaller than the freighters lifeboats. I mean you wonder How on earth could four or five teenagers capture a freighter subduing a far larger crew and extracting millions of dollars in ransom? Wonder no more. Greengrass -- director of two Bourne movies and the based-on-real-life Sept. 11 nightmare United 93 -- bows to no one when it comes to bringing screen clarity to complex action. Give the man a Point A a Point B and half a dozen perfectly good reasons the two cant be visually or logically connected and hell still manage to give you the cinematic equivalent of a straight line. He has a capacity for making murky plans transparent subterfuges clear and in Captain Phillips he brushes in the built-in defenses of the freighter Maersk Alabama before its quite occurred to you to grapple with how a hijacker might get past them. Captain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks sporting a distracting New England accent but otherwise persuasive) has no sooner boarded the ship than hes found grates unlocked between decks and ordered extra security checks. By the time the ship is rounding the Horn of Africa a day or so out of port in April 2009 hes presiding over a full-on security drill. The timing proves fortuitous. The men have barely been mustered when the drill becomes more than an exercise. i Newcomer Barkhad Abdi (middle) plays Muse who leads fellow pirates Bilal (Barkhad Abdirahman right) Elmi (Mahat Ali left) and Najee in the hijacking. Hopper Stone SMPSP/Columbia Pictures hide caption toggle caption Hopper Stone SMPSP/Columbia Pictures Newcomer Barkhad Abdi (middle) plays Muse who leads fellow pirates Bilal (Barkhad Abdirahman right) Elmi (Mahat Ali left) and Najee in the hijacking. Hopper Stone SMPSP/Columbia Pictures ""I dont like the look of that"" Phillips growls peering at twin blips that shouldnt be on his ships radar. He likes it even less when he scrutinizes them through his binoculars and sees two tiny fishing skiffs speeding toward his ship manned by Somalis with assault rifles who are looking at his freighter much as Ahab once looked at Moby-Dick. Phillips radios for help and when its not forthcoming he gets creative scaring off one skiffs crew with a clever exercise in what you might call sleight of voice. The other skiffs crew though is made of sterner stuff -- and relentless as led by the gaunt scarily calm Muse played by newcomer Barkhad Abdi. Though Phillips buys the crew time to hide below decks -- the locks on those grates prove utterly useless -- the lumbering freighter cant outrun the skiff and soon its been boarded by four determined young pirates. Greengrass being an old hand at ratcheting up tension this first half of the movie works more or less the way youd expect. But then Phillips gets trapped with the pirates in a tiny enclosed lifeboat separate from the ship and the film shifts into less thoroughly charted dramatic waters with the director making the pirates strikingly individual and the story turning into a saga of haves and have-nots. As two very different ""captains"" square off and the desperation of the Somalis comes into sharper focus the film becomes both more intimate and more politically intriguing. This part of the film and a denouement that finds Hanks getting startlingly raw and personal are transformative allowing the film to overcome an endgame that plays a bit like a Navy SEAL recruitment film. (Of course it actually happened so you cant fault the filmmakers for that.) And anyway Hanks and Abdi are so compellingly matched that unlike with most thrillers it wont be the action climax in Captain Phillips thatll stick with you. Itll be that aftermath which gets at the emotional toll of terrorism in a way few movies have.

Photo Credit Columbia Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The captain of a shipping vessel is taken hostage by Somali pirates. Based on a true story. Rated PG-13 (sustained intense sequences of menace some violence with bloody images and for substance use) BOTTOM LINE Heart-pounding action against a backdrop of tricky politics -- not to mention a terrific turn from Hanks -- make this a tense gripping thriller for the age of globalization. CAST Tom Hanks Barkhad Abdi Barkhad Abdirahman LENGTH 214 Twenty years ago ""Captain Phillips"" might have been a very different movie. The true story of shipping vessel captain Richard Phillips taken hostage in April 2009 by a crew of Somali pirates would likely have become an exercise in fireball-fueled hoorah xenophobia. You can imagine the cast Steven Segal perhaps plus a thousand dark-skinned expendables. But ""Captain Phillips"" is something new. It exists in a post-9/11 world that for Americans at least feels increasingly large and complicated. The movies focus is on Phillips a blue-collar Bostonian nicknamed ""Irish"" by his captors and played by an excellent (though imperfectly accented) Tom Hanks. What makes the movie so compelling though is a wider political perspective that helps us understand and even pity the villains. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Who was the Sons of Anarchy Homeless Woman? Theyre convincingly played by four Somali-American actors led by Barkhad Abdi as their frail but ferocious captain Muse (pronounced moo-SEE). Theyre subsistence-level fishermen not political zealots and the bloated container ships of the West are their prey. When Muse and his men conquer the enormous MV Maersk Alabama using just a tiny skiff and an aluminum ladder -- an astounding sequence with the realistic thrill of a nature documentary -- its hard not to feel awe mingled with horror. Not that our loyalties ever shift. But as each captain resorts to increasingly desperate measures to outwit and outlast the other it becomes clear that larger forces -- economic political military -- are at work. Muse has warlord bosses to answer to while Phillips becomes dimly aware that his own government may decline to save him. ""Whatever happens"" says a disembodied voice of American authority ""Captain Phillips does not reach Somalia."" This is the kind of gripping thriller for the age of globalization that director Paul Greengrass has been honing in movies like ""United 93"" and ""The Green Zone."" His results have been hit-and-miss but ""Captain Phillips"" (written by Billy Ray from Phillips memoir) is a near-perfect movie a powerful combination of the personal and the political. ""Theres gotta be something more than . . . kidnapping people"" Phillips tells his captor but thats an appeal to Western reason. ""Maybe in America Irish"" Muse says. ""Maybe in America."" 232 MoviesCaptain Phillips trailer PLOT The captain of a shipping vessel is taken hostage by Somali pirates.

MoviesTom Hanks many roles -- Newsday Tweets from Newsday/newsday-staff TOM HANKS TIRED OF PLAYING REAL PEOPLE Tom Hanks has had enough of playing real people. In Paul Greengrass docudrama ""Captain Phillips"" he plays Richard Phillips the captain of a cargo ship famously taken by Somali pirates in 2009. Earlier this year Hanks made his Broadway debut playing New York journalist Mike McAlary in Nora Ephrons ""Lucky Guy."" And later this year he stars as Walt Disney in ""Saving Mr. Banks"" about the making of ""Mary Poppins."" ""I got to get out of this racket"" Hanks said sheepishly at a recent New York Film Festival event. ""Its killing me."" But playing real-life people comes with various pressures of authenticity. Verisimilitude is a primary aim for Greengrass who made the true-life tales ""United 93"" and ""Bloody Sunday"" with similar documentarylike realism. advertisement | advertise on newsday Hanks met several times with Phillips at his Vermont home to help prepare for the role. ""You dont want to be an idiot"" said Hanks. ""You dont want to ask What were you feeling? What was it like? What were you feeling?

By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 933pm on Thursday Oct. 10 2013 Thursday Oct. 10 2013 Thursday Oct. 10 2013 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Few directors do guys-in-distress better than Paul Greengrass.From the man-on-the-run kineticism of the The Bourne Ultimatum and The Bourne Supremacy to the doomed heroics of United 93 the British director seems fascinated by men driven to the brink. So there was probably no better choice to tell the Hollywood story of Richard Phillips the captain of the Maersk Alabama who was hijacked by Somali pirates in 2009 before being rescued by Navy SEAL snipers.And with Captain Phillips Greengrass doesnt disappoint injecting the story with a sense of nervous energy and creeping claustrophobia. The movie manages to be both tense and suspenseful even though the world knows how it ends. The film starts in a dusty barren Somalia where we meet Muse (Barkhad Abdi) thin as wire and tough as a tire iron. Hes one of several young Somali men responding to a call for volunteers to help commandeer commercial ships making their way through the Gulf of Aden. He quickly shows himself to be a leader standing up to some of the other more aggressive volunteers.Meanwhile Phillips (Tom Hanks) is home in Vermont getting ready to leave for another day at work -- though his job is several thousand miles away. He says goodbye to his wife (Catherine Keener) and heads off into what will turn out to be his place in history.Hanks plays Phillips with a laconic New England stoicism and perhaps its that style that helped the captain deal with not only sometimes trigger-happy pirates but an anxious frightened crew. It also works as counterpoint to the equally determined if more unpredictable and fiery Muse wonderfully played by Abdi in his first major acting role.Ultimately Captain Phillips is a test of wills between two men both of whom just want to make it to another day get back home and not turn the Alabama into their tomb.Predictably the pirates dont have their back stories filled in as much as Phillips. Somalias de-evolution into the chaos that sparked so many men to take up the gun of piracy could fill several movies.Yet Greengrass does manage to humanize the pirates without celebrating their actions. Each of the four has a distinct personality ranging from the impulsive Najee (Faysal Ahmed) to the shy Bilal (Barkhad Abdirahman) who seems torn about what hes doing. Captain Phillips is also impressive from a technical standpoint as it moves from the expanse of the high seas -- the scenes of the pirates on their small boats storming the massive Alabama are electric -- to the walled-in feeling inside the ship and finally the lifeboat.Greengrass working from a script by Billy Ray (State of Play The Hunger Games) deserves credit for taking a news story and breathing the life of art into it.

The spellbinding ""Captain Phillips"" re-creates the 2009 hijacking of an American-crewed freighter off the shore of Somalia. Its an efficient fast-paced survival thriller a gripping character study of men under stress and an object lesson in the power of spare realistic storytelling. The story is straightforward enough to give the film vast appeal but packed with the details that elevate a fine script and premise into a riveting experience. Director Paul Greengrass (""United 93"" ""The Bourne Ultimatum"") a onetime documentary journalist uses hand-held cameras desaturated colors and authentic settings to create a physical world of inarguable authenticity. Theres not an ounce of fat in ""Captain Phillips"" no awkward back story to drag. Character emerges not through emotional dialogue but in action. The conflict with impoverished gunmen seizing a ship packed with the worlds riches is the storys catalyst and its dominant metaphor rolled into one. Tom Hanks has his best role in a decade as Richard Phillips commander of the Maersk Alabama. Heavyset and middle-aged he has spent a long career getting his vessels through rough weather. Hes disciplined by the book a little distant from his crew. But when two small skiffs approach on his ships radar far from fishing waters concern flickers in his eyes. When they return despite his evasive maneuvers bearing AK-47s and grappling hooks the look deepens to fear. Once the pirates reappear every frame is charged with mortal danger. The physical contrast between the bone-thin Africans and the fleshy Americans says everything we need to know about Third World-First World tensions. The film isnt an exercise in liberal hand-wringing. The storys sympathy is squarely with the hostages yet it doesnt provide easy answers. The film notes that these village fishermen turned to crime after high-tech harvesting armadas depleted their fish stocks. When Phillips protests there must be other paths than fishing or piracy one of the Somalis replies ""Maybe in America."" Humanizing the Somali robbers doesnt justify their actions. It amps up the sense of menace by portraying the raiders -- all played by first-time actors from Minneapolis -- as actual people. Najee (Faysal Ahmed) is high-strung hot-tempered and trigger-happy. Bilal (Barkhad Abdirahman) the youngest clearly wishes he were anywhere else. Muse (Barkhad Abdi) their leader is ruthless but not malicious. Its his job to bring a fortune back to his bosses and if some Americans have to die to motivate the insurance companies thats unfortunate. Columbia Pictures Tom Hanks is the captain of a hijacked ship in the true story ""Captain Phillips."" Read an interview with Hanks on page E10. Hanks is on familiar turf here playing a character as smart and moral as his FBI agent from ""Catch Me If You Can"" but as wary and worried as his Army officer in ""Saving Private Ryan."" Placing himself in harms way he alerts his men hiding below decks of the pirate crews movements guiding them through a life-and-death game of hide and seek. The Somali-Americans all stunningly good actors have arguably the tougher job. They turn our natural animosity toward gun-waving criminals to begrudging understanding. Like the reality-based bank heist classic ""Dog Day Afternoon"" we know how the story ends and its still painful to see it.

Its a drive theyve made often over the years - this time to put him on a flight to Oman where he will take charge of a giant container ship. More about Captain Phillips >> But this trip - in spring 2009 on the U.S.-flagged Maersk Alabama bound for Mombasa Kenya - will go down as the uneasiest in the veteran mariners career. Captain Phillips based on the real-life story of the Alabamas hijacking by Somali pirates in the Arabian Sea is an unnerving reenactment realized with a daunting combination of filmmaking craft and actors commitment. Yes its an ""entertainment"" - our Hollywood Everyman Tom Hanks projecting quiet authority and a Yankee twang plays the good captain who is taken by some very bad men. (Catherine Keener is his wife in that opening commuting sequence.) But in a season of movies crammed with impossible suspense - Gravity the forthcoming All Is Lost (the opening-night selection of the Philadelphia Film Festival) - Captain Phillips is likewise more than just an excuse to get our hearts pumping our guts churning in collective dread. This is a story about human beings put to the test - facing profound challenges and their own fears doubts inadequacies. We watch these films and wonder about ourselves about who we are why we are here what we would do. Captain Phillips has been adapted from the merchant seamans memoir A Captains Duty Somali Pirates Navy SEALS and Dangerous Days at Sea. There have been mutinous rumblings from some of his crew who claim now that the movie is out there that Phillips put them and the ship at unnecessary risk and that this account of heroism is more than a little bit apocryphal. But thats the nature of moviedoms ""based on a true story"" tag isnt it? This isnt a documentary. (And even then . . .) The script is by Billy Ray who wrote (and directed) the slow-burning real-life spy drama Breach. And Paul Greengrass who demonstrated formidable action skills with the first and second Matt Damon Bourne sequels was in the directors chair - although its hard to imagine he spent much time actually seated there as he steered his cast down gangways through galleys and into pitch-black engine rooms. Like Greengrass United 93 the grim account of the doomed 9/11 flight Captain Phillips uses its narrow confines to ratchet up the tension the sense of claustrophobia of being trapped. Also like United 93 it presents a group of actors who must bring conviction to roles that can easily become stereotypes and that are not so easily understood. The four armed Somalis who chase down the massive cargo ship in a motor launch were not driven by radical religious dogma but by the lure of cash bounties. Still even as Muse (Barkhad Abdi) their wiry watchful leader tells ""Irish"" - his nickname for the hostage Phillips - that everything will be OK we know things will be anything but. The Alabamas shipmates had been running practice drills because of reports of piracy in the Somali Basin but they were ill-prepared for the men who stormed the bridge with machine guns blazing. Abdi brings a formidable menace to his role but also a lot of emotional nuance. At a certain point as the title of Phillips book suggests the U.S. Navy shows up. This is no vintage B-movie Western rescue however where the cavalry gallops in with a triumphant bugle call sending the villains scattering. The arrival of several Navy vessels and a team of SEALS guarantees only that the stakes for the Somali pirates have been raised. U.S. citizens as hostages - thats a prize worth millions and Muse and his cadre have no choice at this point they have nothing to lose. Gambits are tried escapes attempted. Strategies - on Phillips and his crews side and on their captors - backfire. But one thing is certain as this powerful drama plays out Captain Phillips is harrowing inspiring a must-see piece of moviemaking. sreaphillynews.com 215-854-5629 Steven_Rea www.inquirer.com/onmovies Captain Phillips  (Out of four stars) Directed by Paul Greengrass.

(AP Photo/Sony - Columbia Pictures Jasin Boland) Eric Charbonneau Tom Hanks arrives at Columbia Pictures screening of Captain Phillips on Monday Sept. 30 2013 in Beverly Hills Calif. (Photo by Eric Charbonneau/Invision for Sony Pictures/AP Images) The typical Tom Hanks role is an ordinary American guy who finds himself in extraordinary circumstances. Think of his character in ""Saving Private Ryan"" a high school teacher who becomes a captain in the Army and lands on the bloody beach at Normandy.In his new film Hanks plays another captain of a civilian freighter. Rich Phillips has a wife (Catherine Keener) a suburban home and small headaches in Vermont. But from the bridge of the Maersk Alabama he has an elevated view of the world.On this particular voyage his ship is sailing the Indian Ocean round the tumultuous horn of Africa. Among its many tons of cargo is food aid. Although Captain Phillips is a taciturn Yankee with a grumbling little crew of union seamen we surmise that he is one of the good guys. But hes also an American which makes him a great white whale for pirates. In a fishing village on the coast of Somalia we meet another captain Muse (Barkhad Abdi) an angry runt who elbows onto a skiff with three other outlaws and takes charge. Like Phillips Muse is working for an unseen boss -- in this case its the local strongman who wields the carrot and the stick that drives desperate Somalis to hijack Western vessels for ransom.A true story ""Captain Phillips"" was directed by Paul Greengrass (""United 93"") a British journalist with an expansive worldview. Unlike in the Somalia-set thriller ""Black Hawk Down"" the locals are not caricatured as faceless ""others"" who hate Americans for their freedom. In their war-ravaged land banditry is the most pragmatic path for young men who do not have an education or the option of jobs in a civil society. The image of the tiny skiff racing toward the massive freighter is a potent visual metaphor for economic inequality. Once the fearsome foursome breaches the water cannons and scales the tall walls of the ship ""Captain Phillips"" becomes as exciting as one of Greengrass ""Bourne"" movies. Phillips smartly maneuvers the pirates away from the crew and some vital controls but Muse has an equalizer his gun which he points at the unarmed American and flatly declares ""I am the captain."" Abdi a first-time actor proves himself the equal of Hanks who is virtually assured of award nominations for his strongest performance in years. As Phillips is forced onto a lifeboat and the Navy Seals ride to the rescue the pace quickens and Greengrass trademark handheld-camera style is employed to precise effect.Despite the obvious mismatches involved this isnt a simplistic smackdown. Freighted with weighty issues ""Captain Phillips"" is a film worth debating.What ""Captain Phillips""  Three and a half stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 214  Content Intense action sequences and some bloody violence Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

Captain Phillips a gripping thriller is an excellent example. Your iron man A rumpled bespectacled New England-based captain named Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks). In 2009 he was commandeering a U.S. cargo ship en route to Kenya when a group of young Somali pirates hijacked it demanding millions of dollars. Though the men led by a desperate former fisherman named Muse (Barkhad Abdi) are only whizzing by via a small boat audiences know the invasion is coming. And this doesnt make the scene any less nail-baiting. PHOTOS Celebrity couples -- then and now Phillips is physically overmatched by the gun-toting pirates so its fascinating to watch him use his wits to outsmart them. (Hes especially quick on a guided tour of the massive ship as his crew hides in its bowels). Under the most dire of circumstances hes cautious yet gutsy sympathetic yet domineering. He bellows to his wily mocking captors ""Im the captain Im the captain"" as a way of reassurance not panic. And yet just when it seems like clear heads might prevail and the drama might subside the pirates take the captain hostage aboard a confined lifeboat. PHOTOS Stars and their dads Director Paul Greengrass (United 93 The Bourne Ultimatum) didnt choose the easy way out in this thriller. Instead of green screening it he lensed primarily in the rocky open water -- which lends an extra layer to the films harried pace. Adding to the authenticity he employs real-life steely-nerved Navy SEALS to aid in the captains rescue. Wise decision Who wants to be distracted playing name-that-actor with such high stakes involved? PHOTOS Best movies of 2012 Hanks of course is the exception. Its been too long since the two-time Oscar winner commanded the screen like this. (Specifically its been 13 years. Since 2000s Cast Away hes been wasted in underwhelming films like The Ladykillers The Da Vinci Code and Cloud Atlas). But he takes the leadership role here with a calm confidence carrying his crew and rattled audiences on his back. In such a brutally tense outing hes the ideal choice to anchor it.

Comments (1) click to enlarge Captain Phillips Video Rated PG-13  133 minutes  2013 More cool thrills from the military-entertainment complex with Tom Hanks as the real-life captain of the American shipping vessel hijacked by Somali pirates and rescued by the U.S. Navy in April 2009. Director Paul Greengrass has no peer as a movie dramatist of real-life crises (United 93 Bloody Sunday) and his story adapted from a memoir by Richard Phillips is eminently dramatic. Unfortunately this Oscar bait from Columbia Pictures pursues drama to the exclusion of all else; its a curiously well-scrubbed account of modern-day piracy lacking in political economic or even military nuance and focusing instead on Phillips as a human-interest story (read white audience-identification figure). As such it pales in comparison to Tobias Lindholms white-knuckle Danish drama A Hijacking or even Thymaya Paynes documentary Stolen Seas two recent explorations of Somali crime on the high seas.

"Tom Hanks shines in Captain Phillips review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesTom Hanks shines in Captain Phillips reviewTom Hanks and newcomer Barkhad Abdi court Oscar attention as seafarer vs. pirates antagonists in Captain Phillips.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Oct. 10 2013Captain PhillipsStarring Tom Hanks Barkhad Abdi and Catherine Keener. Directed by Paul Greengrass. 134 minutes. Opens Oct. 10 at major theatres. 14AThe high seas drama Captain Phillips is a survival saga that raises the pulse and tweaks the conscience.Directed by Paul Greengrass who makes smart thrillers and starring Tom Hanks in his best role in years this isnt simply a tale of heroism and adventure. There is anxiety on both sides of the gun as resolve slams into harsh reality.Article Continued BelowWe certainly cheer on Hanks as real-life seafarer Capt. Richard Phillips. In the spring of 2009 Phillips faced almost certain death after his cargo ship and crew of 20 were hijacked off the coast of Somalia by four armed men who demanded millions of dollars in ransom.We are also asked to consider the desperation of the four pirates. The well-rounded script by Billy Ray (The Hunger Games Shattered Glass) based on Phillipss own account shows how the hijackers are driven by extreme poverty and also by the warlords bullets that await them back home should they fail in their mission.Hanks dials down his usual ebullience to radiate quiet determination as Phillips a grey-bearded and bespectacled merchant mariner in his late 50s nearing the end of his career. As he leaves his Vermont home and flies off to Oman to meet the MV Maersk Alabama the cargo ship he will guide through the pirate-infested waters around the Horn of Africa he speaks to his worried wife (Catherine Keener) of mounting global uncertainty caused by terrorist attacks and economic calamity.""Everythings different ... Youve got to be strong to survive out there.""The camera jumps to an impoverished Somali village where an intense wraith of a young man named Muse played by arresting newcomer Barkhad Abdi awakens from fitful slumber to hear an ultimatum from the stooges of a local warlord. Cargo ship heists are down and the warlord isnt happy. Capture another ship soon the stooges tell Muse and his friends ""or you will answer for it.""Muse isnt inclined to argue nor does he lack courage. He and other village men form a small flotilla of tiny boats to sail out some 200 kilometres to take on the Alabama a laughable situation except for the machine guns they carry. Meanwhile Phillips prepares his crew for a confrontation many of them arent willing to face.""This is a real-world situation"" he barks. ""Theyre not here to fish""Its in such furious moments where director Greengrass outclasses all rivals. He recreated airborne Sept. 11 terror in the docudrama United 93 and sent Matt Damon on the run in the Jason Bourne spy drama series so a watery showdown is right in his wheelhouse. Its also here where Captain Phillips departs from A Hijacking a well-received film of similar theme released earlier this year by Tobias Lindholm a Danish filmmaker. Lindholm seemed reluctant to go with conventional thriller aspects even choosing not to show the actual pirate attack. Greengrass dives right in and so do cinematographer Barry Ackroyd and composer Henry Jackman. Theyre all eager to use Hollywood techniques to depict headline realism but they give the actors room to breathe.Abdi courts Oscar attention for his forceful performance -- as does Hanks already a two-time Best Actor winner.Captain Phillips turns into a deadly game of cat-and-mouse with the captain and the pirates taking turns as hunter and hunted. If you follow the news you know how the story ends with an assault by Navy SEALS that recalls the recent Zero Dark Thirty another fact-based actioner. What you cant prepare for is how this film leaves you not singing ""God Bless America"" but rather pondering a dysfunctional world where hollow-eyed men of skin and bones feel compelled to take on a superpower.The pirates really would prefer to just be fishermen Muse tells Phillips but global economics thwart them ""Big ships come to our waters take all the fish out.

Somali actors By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Oct 10 2013 1017 AM Every now and then a news story pops up about piracy on the high seas and it usually evokes the same response every time There are still pirates? There are and in Paul Greengrass film ""Captain Phillips"" we learn a little bit about what they are like (no Jolly Roger flies over these waters) and why they do what they do (for the money sure but its more complicated). The film is based on the real-life hijacking of the U.S. ship Maersk Alabama in 2009 and on the memoirs of Richard Phillips the captain of the title. Tom Hanks is outstanding in the role a performance unlike what were used to from him. Whatever political explanations and emotional resonance Greengrass is going for ""Captain Phillips"" is more than anything a seafaring adventure story and a thrilling one. If that means its not as ambitious as it might have been so be it. The film begins with Phillips preparing to set sail. Hell be traveling from Oman to Mombasa Kenya. He and the crew know that there is the possibility of piracy -- they train for it -- but it seems a low-level threat just another box to check off while getting ready. Phillips is a quiet man who doesnt hang around with the crew. Hes all business; he never takes part in the post-shift chitchat and coffee the other men enjoy. (In fact when he thinks theyve had enough he orders them back to work.) Then Greengrass takes us to Somalia where a different kind of preparation is under way. A local warlord who obviously terrifies the villagers arrives and berates the people They need to make him more money and seizing ships is the way to do it. His demeanor -- and his thugs -- makes it clear that this is not a negotiation. Its an order. So a man named Muse (Barkhad Abdi) and others head to sea in rickety boats looking for a boat to steal from. When they come upon the Maersk Alabama its like winning the lottery. Or so they think. It will prove to be a bigger boat than they bargained for. They manage to board and demand money from Phillips and the crew. Its almost surreal these four men -- well-armed but overmatched at least in terms of sophistication -- trying to take charge. Were meant to draw parallels between Phillips and Muse it seems. Both are captains of a crew they dont really relate to and both are seeking control. Its an interesting concept but events conspire to push it to the back-burner. Without giving too much away in the latter third of the film the U.S. Navy and its SEAL teams are called in. Again it seems like a David-and-Goliath situation and in some respects it is. Yet there is more to overpowering your opponent. It takes strategy patience and immense concentration. Here as with depicting why the Somalis resort to piracy Greengrass shows us why things play out the way they do. The easy solutions are rarely as simple as we imagine. Hanks shines as the taciturn Phillips with none of the good-guy charm were used to coming through. And a scene at the end again without spoiling things is astonishing. Abdi is also terrific. Muse is not just a mindless thug. He is a desperate man thrust into a desperate situation. Greengrass brings the urgency of the ""Bourne"" films he directed to the proceedings with hand-held cameras that add to the immediacy (or make you queasy if you dont like that sort of thing). This is particularly effective when the action shifts to a more-claustrophobic setting. If it sounds a little all over the place it is but mostly in terms of ideas (and some chaos is built into stories like this to begin with). Its not meant to be smooth sailing and overall ""Captain Phillips"" is a voyage well-worth taking. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

"Captain Phillips movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Captain Phillips a solid tale of man versus pirates October 10 2013|Michael Phillips""Captain Phillips"" is a Tom Hanks movie. It is also a Paul Greengrass movie and the cinematic tumult director Greengrass adroitly captures and sustains in the service of a narrative has a way of keeping his stars unmoored -- in a good way -- while trumping conventional Hollywood notions of a star vehicle.Heroism exists in a Greengrass picture. But the British-born documentary-trained director best known for ""United 93"" and the second and third ""Bourne"" thrillers is more interested in messy lucky-to-be-alive real-world heroism than in movie-world heroism. Greengrass sees the world as a complicated place; his preferred jabbing editing rhythms and camera proximity ensure that audiences experience it the same way.Capt. Richard Phillips is all business and so is Hanks portrayal.In 2009 the Massachusetts-born Vermont-based U.S. Merchant Marine commander of the cargo ship Maersk Alabama overseeing three different sets of union crews and union crew regulations encountered four pirates who made their way to the U.S.-registered ship in a small craft off the coast of Somalia in the Gulf of Aden. Phillips crew of 20 had been undergoing a safety drill; then the radar signified the approach of an unidentified intruder. Because the container cargo ship was sailing in notorious pirate-infested waters Phillips knew how much potential trouble was afoot. Written by Billy Ray inspired by Phillips own account of what happened next the film tightens the screws for 134 minutes and relays how Phillips ended up in a lifeboat with his captors on dwindling rations waiting for the Navy SEALs to resolve a highly pressurized situation.To honorably mixed results Greengrass and Ray do their best to allow the Somali characters and the actors (new to professional acting) playing them some room to establish Phillips adversaries as human beings albeit brutal and desperate ones. Barkhad Abdi hired out of the Somali immigrant community of Minneapolis plays the rifle-slinging leader a fisherman by trade forced into his second and treacherous line of work by economic and political crises (touched upon briefly in the early scenes probably too briefly). The worlds instability is connected by human threads as is made clear in a prologue conversation on the way to the airport between Phillips and his justifiably worried wife (Catherine Keener reduced to a one-scene player in the final edit). The pair talk about the uncertain universe their children about to enter a difficult global workforce are inheriting. But as the rest of the movie makes plain there are difficult economic straits and then there are poverty-stricken-Somali-fishermen-turned-pirates economic straits.We get to know members of the cargo ship crew only in fits and starts (Chris Mulkey a valuable character actor plays one). Its Hanks show though some may be surprised to see how little of the usual emotional hooks and beats intrude on the procedural at hand.""Captain Phillips"" is one of Greengrass good films if not one of his three or four terrific ones. There are times in the screaming close-ups of the Somali actors when you wish Greengrass and his excellent regular cinematographer Barry Ackroyd (who also shot ""The Hurt Locker"") would back off a little. Going for clarity of line and context the script stints on offhanded details of character. For better or worse Greengrass preferred method of fact-based storytelling sees the forest first and the trees second.But at the risk of hyping its impact when Hanks comes out the other side of his real-life characters blood-spattered experience theres a scene as strong as any Ive seen this year and as strong as any either Greengrass or Hanks has managed in other sorts of movies. Its not a long scene (though one wonders if were destined to sit through bits of it over and over come awards nomination season). It is however just about perfect in its wrenching emotion expressed by an actor clearly up to the challenge of acting in a Paul Greengrass docudrama -- which is to say acting with as little capital-A Acting as possible.mjphillipstribune.com""Captain Phillips"" Three starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for sustained intense sequences of menace some violence with bloody images and for substance use)Running time 214Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesHow Captain Phillips Shows Modern Piracy in All Its...October 14 2013Searching for the truth in a true storyOctober 8 2013Box Office Gravity Orbits 30 Million In Week 2...October 10 2013Real Captain Phillips warns cuts could hit Pentagon...October 10 2013Somali pirates We will hunt Americans slaughter themApril 16 2009Find More Stories AboutTom HanksCargo ShipCaptain PhillipsBarkhad AbdiTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-1008-captain-phillips-20131010,0,3185889.column",200,captainphillips31,captainphillips,chicagotribune

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet With Captain Phillips the British action filmmaker Paul Greengrass takes a break from sending Matt Damon racing across rooftops his efforts devoted instead to re-creating--with queasy you-are-there immediacy--the 2009 hijacking of an American cargo ship by Somali pirates. Dividing the focus among a variety of vantage points including those of the besieged crew the young hijackers and the control-room cavalry Greengrass echoes the immersive docudrama strategy of his own United 93. Only in this case there are fewer holes in the official story While that earlier film speculated wildly about what occurred aboard the doomed aircraft making its commitment to ""just the facts maam"" realism a bit suspect Captain Phillips draws heavily from a seemingly reliable source--namely the first-person account of its eponymous seafarer played here by Tom Hanks. By adopting the kidnapped captains perspective the movie also gains a dramatic center its predecessor lacked though the tradeoff is that the events are largely filtered through his attitudes. An early car-ride exchange between Hanks and his wife (Catherine Keener on hand for a single scene) clumsily foregrounds the films thematic angle which amounts to viewing both its hero and his armed adversaries as casualties of a cutthroat money-driven system. Minutes later Greengrass drops in on the Somali pirates just minding their own business on dry land until their warlord boss demands that they get to pillaging and plundering. Already screenwriter Billy Ray is overselling the parallels between his dueling protagonists two men pushed into extreme circumstances by the financial interests that control their fates. ""Its just business"" insists wiry teenage ringleader Barkhad Abdi after his team successfully seizes the American vessel. But something deeper a captains code perhaps will eventually influence his decisions as Hanks earns the begrudging respect of his captor. The film stops just short of having one of them say in his best Romulan ""You and I are of a kind."" More often that not however Captain Phillips is riveting. Though he remains unfortunately convinced that violently shaking his camera is the best way to achieve visual urgency Greengrass nevertheless excels at pressure-cooker scenarios. Theres a level of procedural detail here and an interest in specific maritime protocol that lends the films hijacking sequence--in which Hanks delays the attack using breakneck steering and a clever bluff--a jolt of believability. Unlike many of his Hollywood contemporaries the director prefers to fill the margins of his movies with unknowns. While even exceptional pictures like Zero Dark Thirty and the upcoming 12 Years A Slave sometimes violate the reality of their worlds with distracting star cameos Greengrass uses a sea of unfamiliar faces to strengthen the verisimilitude. Captain Phillips is stacked top to bottom with exceptional no-name actors from Hanks crew evading capture in the bowels of the ship to the young Somalis who bite off much more than they can chew. At the helm of this vessel is Hanks exuding levelheaded confidence and an almost paternal warmth; its his best performance in years one that resurrects the actors dormant gift--shared by Hollywood ancestors like Gregory Peck and Jimmy Stewart--for charismatic decency. Both Captain Phillips and Captain Phillips understand that being a great leader involves a degree of manipulation. What keeps the man alive even after his enemies have taken him hostage aboard the lifeboat and fled for Somalian sanctuary is his ability to ingratiate himself to these desperate criminals. But is his respect for Abdi a villain undone by the pressures of command genuine or just a survival strategy? In its best moments Captain Phillips gains a touch of Dog Day Afternoon melancholy with only Hanks grasping the reality of his captors situation. That quality alas is a bit incompatible with the badassery of the ZDT-style climax which finds the films interests drifting toward the armed forces that intervened. For all Greengrass attempts at dramatic fairness and balance theres little doubt as to where his sympathies really lie. Its hard to blame him for taking sides.

It is a daydream that Tom Hanks has spent a career making real. There is something in him -- both his talent as an actor and the everyday magic of his stardom -- that invites immediate identification. We see him as one of us. We see ourselves on screen. And we imagine -- we hope -- that we too could pilot back a damaged spaceship survive being cast away on a desert island find a missing G.I. in war-torn Europe fight for our rights as an American. Or stand up to Somali pirates. That is the challenge he faces in ""Captain Phillips"" the based-in-fact story of a 50-ish New Englander whose commercial vessel was grabbed by hijackers in 2009. Thinking coolly acting calmly Phillips managed to save his crew protect his cargo and get the pirates to go. Their only condition however was that he go with them. And so rather than going down with his ship this quiet captain saved it and everyone and everything on it -- by leaving on a lifeboat with four armed and increasingly erratic men with nothing but a slim hope that somehow his country would come for him. Its a straightforward and suspenseful story -- even if you remember the ending -- and its given its respectful due in this fine drama likely to become a classic and guaranteed to be an Oscar contender. I wouldnt have felt so secure making those assertions before I saw it. Although director Paul Greengrass has a solid background in documentaries and has dramatized real-life horrors before -- ""Bloody Sunday"" ""United 93"" -- hes also a devotee of the ""shakycam"" aesthetic. That nausea-inducing handheld approach marked both his ""Bourne"" films and ""Green Zone"" and has infected other action movies since. The idea of combining that with the rolling and pitching of a wave-tossed lifeboat felt like a recipe for seasickness. (And Greengrass has admitted his camera crew was often queasy during the shoot.) Yet perhaps because the film is so filled with closeups the occasional shakiness isnt so obvious. Instead we focus on faces. Mostly of course we focus on Tom Hanks. His captain is a naturally calm and detail-oriented person -- its part of the job description -- and at first he seems to show very little fear. But hes feeling it and the real drama comes from how hard he works to tamp it down. Hes actually putting on his own performance for the pirates and its only at the end when he finally lets loose when we see how tightly Phillips has been wound -- and how completely in control Hanks is. The film falters a bit mostly at the beginning; its slow to get started and the scenes of Phillips home life show us little beyond the fact that he has a home. (Theyre so perfunctory Greengrass rarely bothers to get Catherine Keener playing Phillips wife even in frame.) There are some other problems. For example Greengrass isnt interested in portraying the Somali pirates as simple monsters; he carefully sets up parallel shots that link them to the American sailors visually and physically and to have dialogue that traces their lawlessness back to the collapsed Somali economy (itself blamed on multinational corporations). N.J. NEWS ON THE GO Our redesigned mobile site has quick page loads and app-style navigation and lets you join the conversation with comments and social media. Visit NJ.com from any mobile browser. Its a gooey bit of empathy OK but worse its then undercut by Greengrass own cast. Because -- apart from Barkhad Abdi who has the lead -- the Somali-American actors are so over-the-top so full of bulging eyes and sudden violence that they demolish Greengrass own argument. These people arent brutish criminals? Just watch them. But actually politics enter little into ""Captain Phillips."" Because basically this is a crime story that slowly builds to a very good second half and a drama with a fine performance at its heart. And thats how it should really be seen. For it is not despite Greengrass attempts at showing the villains humanity any sort of apology for piracy. Nor is it as some critics have already claimed a full-throated defense of U.S. foreign policy. (As if the director of ""Green Zone"" would ever be an unquestioning cheerleader for U.S. foreign policy.) Yes the SEALs arrive towards the end and yes they do what SEALs are trained to do -- and Ill bet you can tell the theaters that are showing this movie from the applause that erupts when they do it. But ultimately all theyre doing is their job and thats what ""Captain Phillips"" is really all about Doing your job. And having the courage to when called upon do just that much more.

But director Paul Greengrass is unique. At a glance his live-wire ragged-camera method may seem overly familiar but the way he employs it that method is as expressive as the style of a superb novelist. The note of authenticity he strikes isnt just about how he holds the camera. Its about what the camera is shooting Greengrass sets up and stages organically detailed situations that he then films as if he were making a documentary. He pioneered that method in Bloody Sunday (2002) his spectacular drama about the 1972 Northern Ireland massacre and he carried it into his two Bourne films (making the most far-fetched espionage potboilers seem genuine) and of course into United 93 the galvanizing post-9/11 dramatization that let you feel like you were right on board that doomed plane. Greengrass keeps you off balance -- hes a jittery poet of reality. And he proves that yet again in Captain Phillips his suspensefully spiky thriller based on a shattering incident from April 2009 when the crew of a U.S. cargo ship the MV Maersk Alabama was held hostage for several days by a band of Somali pirates armed with machine guns. Early on Greengrass echoes what he did in United 93 letting us peek separately into the lives of both the victims and their attackers before the vehicle in question takes off. Capt. Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) a veteran merchant mariner still lives in his native New England and hes a plainspoken family man full of anxiety about the economically bleak new world his kids are facing. When his wife (Catherine Keener) drops him off at the airport we can see he reveres her. The film then cuts to Somalia a land of dust and poverty where the pirates are recruited for their mission as if they were migrant farmworkers lining up to be chosen for that days labor. Greengrass doesnt have to fill in much about the violent chaotic breakdown of Somalia to let us know that these men have little choice in life Taking up arms to steal or even to kill is the central option their society has handed them. When the giant cargo liner rounds the Horn of Africa Captain Phillips realizes hes in dangerous waters. A radar that detects the pirates as they zoom toward the ship on two motorboats gives you a sickening feeling. As soon as they climb aboard evading the spray of water hoses that are the crews only ""weapons"" we know were seeing a clash of two cultures the privileged Western world with its power and bounty (all symbolized by the vastness of that ship) and the desperate quarters of the Third World locked outside the loop of technological progress and hope. One of the pirates a young fellow named Muse is played by Barkhad Abdi who has the ravaged bone-hungry face of a starving child all grown up. That face haunts the movie and so does Abdis extraordinary acting. Muse is ruthless forlorn street-smart naive (he wants millions of dollars even though theres only 30000 on the ship) and even compassionate all at the same time. In dramatic terms hes the enemy yet Abdis performance inspires us to ask How in the modern world did the violence Muse embodies become part of the family of man? Phillips must guard his crew negotiate with the pirates and keep his own fears in check and Hanks acts with a minimalism that speaks volumes Were wired into his every glance. Phillips sends the pirates on a wild goose chase throughout the massive ship and Captain Phillips becomes a gripping life-or-death chess game Who will survive? Who will outwit whom? But in the second half when Phillips is forced to board an enclosed lifeboat along with the pirates the films suspense begins to ebb. Its not that Greengrass electrifying style fails him. Its that the movie tethered for close to an hour to the strategies and tensions aboard the lifeboat keeps giving us things to observe but maybe not so much to discover.

Despite a running time of more than two hours and minus the kind of explosive violence that keeps action buffs yelling for more Captain Phillips the true story of the 2009 crisis at sea in which Somali pirates hijacked the unarmed U.S. cargo ship Maersk Alabama and held Captain Richard Phillips of Vermont as a hostage makes for a gripping seamlessly staged film that is certain to win Tom Hanks another Oscar nomination in the title role. With a screenplay by Billy Ray and cogent realistic direction by the talented Paul Greengrass--who won praise for United 93 as well as combustible thrillers The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum--the movie is based on Capt. Phillipss book A Captains Duty Somali Pirates Navy SEALS and Dangerous Days at Sea. Equally adept at building factual documentary-style excitement and investigating the human elements behind headline events Mr. Greengrass is the perfect director to juxtapose the harrowing experience of a peaceful civilian merchant mariner taken prisoner on his own ship with the motives of the economically deprived and desperate pirate who masterminds the ransom plot (played with tense ferocity by novice Somali actor Barkhad Abdi). By the time this emotionally draining film reaches its resolution you feel like you know them both as well as the crews who follow their orders. The film stretches from a pristine colonial house in New England where Captain Phillips and his wife (Catherine Keener in a small but vital cameo) talk about domestic issues on their way to the airport to Solalah Oman where the captain boards the Alabama to transport 2400 tons of cargo including food and medical supplies through the pirate-infested Somali basin on its way to Mombasa Kenya. The mammoth freighter is in the middle of its first security drill when the crew on the bridge first spots the approaching skiffs loaded with weapons. Armed with nothing but water hoses for defense Captain Phillips faces an ordeal that requires cunning and courage beyond expectation. When the terrorists finally leave the ship in one tiny orange lifeboat taking the captain with them as a hostage the film switches gears and the setting is reduced from the open water to the claustrophobia of capture. Bloody and near death an ordinary man tests every strength he didnt know he had before three giant American warships and an anti-piracy task force of Navy SEALS arrive bringing the films long-awaited action with them. Theres a lot of talk between the big scenes which might inspire restlessness among audiences expecting more. The transfer the tow the exchange and the orders by telephone are elaborately detailed and it all gets tedious. But the lull is temporary and under the trigger-ready direction of Paul Greengrass everything pays off handsomely in a series of well-timed encounters that keep you on the edge of your seat. A lot of it is improvised including the ending in the infirmary featuring a number of nonactors who interact with the two-time Oscar-winning star like seasoned pros. Mr. Hanks in yet another in a long line of diverse character studies does a beautiful job as the voice of reason and logic trying to inspire bravery and maintain order amid the noise and panic. In the big emotional scenes as well as the small nerve-jangling scenes he is an artist at the top of his skill. Its a different kind of role for him but he matches the epic scale of conflict at sea with the intimacy of an ordinary guys most private feelings in ways that are truly memorable. Add Mr. Hankss ocean survival in Captain Phillips to Robert Redfords hair-raising adventure as a single sailor adrift in the path of an apocalyptic storm at sea in the forthcoming All Is Lost and you have two of the most powerful and absorbing competitions for Best Actor awards you will see this year.

"Movie review Captain Phillips - Movies - NorthJersey.com Get News Alerts Arts amp; Entertainment (c) 2016 North Jersey Media Group October 11 2013 1040 AM Movie review Captain Phillips By JOCELYN NOVECK The Associated Press | Wire Service CAPTAIN PHILLIPS 134 minutes PG-13 (for violence strong language and drug use) Directed by Paul Greengrass. Produced by Dana Brunetti and Michael De Luca. Written by Billy Ray based on the book ""A Captains Duty"" by Richard Phillips and Stephan Talty. Photographed by Barry Ackroyd. Edited by Christopher Rouse. Music by Henry Jackman. With Tom Hanks and Barkhad Abdi. If you saw Paul Greengrasss ""United 93"" a terrifying depiction of one of the doomed flights on 9/11 you know this director can evoke a harrowing real-life event like few others. In fact you may not have recovered yet from the experience. So its no surprise that Greengrass has produced another expertly crafted documentary-style film based on a real event - the 2009 hijacking of a cargo ship by Somali pirates and the five-day standoff that ensued with the ships American captain Richard Phillips held captive in a stifling covered lifeboat after offering himself as a hostage. A major difference is that this movie has a happy ending - for the captain anyway who was rescued in a dramatic high-seas Navy sniper operation. Three of the overmatched attackers were killed; the fourth is in a U.S. prison. More cinematically speaking the difference is that ""Captain Phillips"" is a star vehicle. In some cases this can detract from the sense of veracity of a truth-based film. Tom Hanks though delivers some of his finest work here playing the Everyman role he does so well in this case a fairly ordinary guy forced by circumstance to be a hero. And yet ""Captain Phillips"" is a remarkably unsentimental film with an emotional catharsis coming only at the very end when were all ready for some kind of release. This is where Hanks digs deepest as an actor. Oddly the film falters only at the beginning - in a brief and awkward domestic scene between Phillips preparing for what he assumes is a routine voyage and his wife Andrea (Catherine Keener in a tiny part). The two share stilted dialogue on a drive to the airport with her asking ""Its gonna be OK right?"" and him commenting stiffly that the ""world is moving so fast."" But once Phillips gets onto his ship the movie truly starts. What Greengrass excels at is action - taut and visceral - and it happens as soon as the captain suddenly looks at a screen and sees two small dots moving toward the ship. Two skiffs are carrying bands of armed men; from an early scene on a Somali beach we know theyve been whipped into action by their warlords. When they realize theyve happened upon a U.S. ship they cant believe their luck. What WE cant believe is how a huge cargo ship is so vulnerable to small bands of armed men. But the Maersk Alabama has no gun power aboard only huge hoses to repel pirates and their machine guns. They dont work. Soon four pirates have hoisted a ladder onto the ship. ""Im the captain now"" says their leader Muse. And the ordeal begins. Greengrass and cinematographer Barry Ackroyd are at their most effective in scenes like the frightening search - in tense dark spaces in extreme closeup - by increasingly angry pirates hunting down the crew. On the other hand this is where the camerawork gets ever more unstable and jittery. Good for dramatic effect - but bad if youre susceptible to queasiness or nausea at such times. Be forewarned. Things get even more intense in the lifeboat where the pirates are locked in with Phillips for several agonizing days. With the U.S. Navy bearing down its pretty clear where its all headed. The only question Who will die? The movie humanizes the pirates but is not inclined to forgive them. All four Somali actors are excellent but especially Barkhad Abdi memorable as Muse. As for Hanks his final moments are his best as Phillips registers in an intensely personal way the cumulative effects of what hes endured. Its safe to say those moments will be whats remembered most from this movie and for a long time.

Just to remind them here comes a prestige-grade action movie about refusing to negotiate with head-in-the-sand types. Based on the real-life 2009 Maersk Alabama incident Captain Phillips is a real thank-God-for-the-cavalry film After Somali pirates board a shipping vessel and seize the American captain as collateral the U.S. Navy speeds to the scene with little interest in finessing the situation. Zero Dark Thirty handled this kind of frighteningly precise night-scope operation with just the right tone of ominousness. This time facts dictate an abrupt thud. Narratively speaking its a killer. Which is all one way of saying that Captain Phillips is almost certainly about the wrong guy. As the title character Tom Hanks does a solid job especially during the pre-siege bits when his stiff-backed propriety has him frowning at less-than-shipshape conditions open hatch locks and crew disorderliness. But the underwritten script (by Shattered Glasss Billy Ray) sells him out pretty quickly and you turn to the invading horde for dramatic nourishment. Muse (Barkhad Abdi) the self-appointed new captain burns brighter--how could he not?--as Hankss star vehicle tips toward passivity. Compare Hollywoods effort to Denmarks recent A Hijacking rich with corporate guilt and off-board tensions and the shortcomings are clear. Director Paul Greengrass remains a genius of claustrophobia yet his better films--Bloody Sunday (2002) United 93 (2006) and The Bourne Ultimatum (2007)--all beat with a stronger sense of central identification. He doesnt have as much to work with this time and his solution is to slow down the pace. The result is more clarity but also more monotony. Greengrasss heroes are all trapped to some extent but save one masterful scene of post-traumatic shock (where Hanks earns the lions share of our sympathy) theres way too much floating around in a tin can.

"Captain Phillips | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; captain-phillips ) Captain Phillips (United States 2013) October 08 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Movies like Captain Phillips - taut white-knuckle thrillers that feature ordinary guys instead of bona fide action heroes - are something of an endangered species. In todays risk-averse movie industry making an ""action"" film without an established heroic type is a risky proposition. And while Tom Hanks is a marketable name no one is going to confuse him with Dwayne Johnson or Vin Diesel. In fact Captain Phillips works precisely because Hanks isnt a muscle-bound gun-toting figure (nor does he turn into one during the course of the movie). Placed in an untenable position he uses guile and intelligence instead of brawn and weapons to enhance his survival chances. The result is an intense experience that will leave many viewers exhausted by the time the 2 1/4-hour running time expires. If theres a knock against director Paul Greengrass its that hes overly fond of shaky handheld shots. He also loves close-ups. Theres nothing in Captain Phillips to challenge the overindulgence of The Bourne Supremacy so at least Greengrass has chosen to rein in things a little. Still there are instances especially early in the proceedings when the cameras lack of stability is noticeable. Those with a sensitivity to such things are advised to sit toward the back of the theater. By about the 30-minute mark however I no longer noticed this - either I had gotten used to it or the on-screen action was so intense that I forgot about it. Billy Rays screenplay is based on a factual book written by Captain Richard Phillips (co-authored by Stephan Talty) called A Captains Duty Somali Pirates Navy SEALS and Dangerous Days at Sea. It tells of events in April 2009 when Phillips (Tom Hanks) commanding the merchant vessel Maersk Alabama helped defend his ship against Somali Pirates. Eventually four armed men boarded the ship and Phillips was able to keep them off-guard. He was taken prisoner aboard a life raft and became a pawn in game of brinksmanship between the pirates and the United States Navy. Despite some condensations and other changes necessary to make the story fit into a movie of reasonable length Captain Phillips is true to the events related in the book. The veracity of the film is unsurprising Greengrass was similarly rigorous in his treatment of 9/11 in United 93. With Cast Away Tom Hanks proved that he can be trusted to front a film in which his character is placed in constant evolving jeopardy. In a way Captain Phillips is a close cousin. Hanks is an everyman. Hes excellent at representing how a normal person might react in this situation by seeking to avoid a confrontation and when that proves impossible to achieve victory by outthinking his opponents rather than blowing them up. We can relate to Rich Phillips which is more than can be said of most movie characters in similar situations. Hanks is often pigeonholed as a lightweight actor but theres nothing lightweight about this role or this performance. For the most part everyone not named ""Hanks"" is either a character actor or an unknown. The four men playing the pirates - Barkhad Abdi Barkhad Abdirahman Faysal Ahmed Mahat M. Ali - are making their feature debuts but theres no lack of experience evident. Their portrayals are spot-on and credible. The bickering between them is believable as is the element of desperation in their actions. The refrain of the leader ""Everythings gonna be all right"" metamorphoses from words of reassurance to an ominous lie as events unfold. Captain Phillips will leave the average viewer drained. After a brief 15-minute setup theres little down time for the rest of the film. Its divided into two roughly equal segments. The first details the cat-and-mouse game between Phillips and his crew and the pirates. The second is a hostage drama in which the captive bears witness to quarrels among his captors as his life hangs in the balance. With its focus on Navy ops and SEAL involvement theres a little flavor of Zero Dark Thirty in this portion of the tale. Although its too early to say whether Captain Phillips will be a player in the end-of-the-year Oscar race theres little doubt in my mind that this will feature prominently on a list of 2013s most uncompromising thrillers. Hanks represents our portal into a tempestuous sea. Captain Phillips (United States 2013) Director Paul Greengrass Cast Tom Hanks Barkhad Abdi Barkhad Abdirahman Faysal Ahmed Mahat M.

By Anthony Lane Tom Hanks confronts pirates in a new movie directed by Paul Greengrass.   Credit Illustration by Tomer Hanuka The British director Paul Greengrass makes two kinds of movie. The first kind is the thriller about people for whom life is already a cavalcade of thrills--Jason Bourne for instance a man so busy jumping through windows and driving head on into approaching traffic that it takes him three whole films to find out that his real name is David. The second kind is the thriller about people whose lives are for the most part extremely unthrilling and who given the choice would prefer to keep it that way. In the case of ""Bloody Sunday"" and ""United 93"" the choice is not theirs to make and the mood of those emerging from the cinema at the end could hardly be more different from the joyous exhaustion of a Bourne fan. The confusing thing is that both kinds of movie look the same. Editing for Greengrass creates a lung-bursting race against the clock and the camera shifts and hops about like someone trying to get a better glimpse through a crowd. He started out in television documentaries and the impulse to trap something--a gesture a phrase--as it zips by or at least to give the illusion of that capture pervades his feature films. Hence the moment in his new movie ""Captain Phillips"" when the title character (Tom Hanks) and his wife (Catherine Keener) leave their house in Vermont and get into their car. We cut back inside the house and see them through the window; for an instant we sense them being spied on as if by the eye of fate. They then drive away and in the movies weakest scene explain to each other how dangerous the world has become. Thanks guys. Our nerves already gave us the bad news. Phillips is on his way to Oman in order to take command of the Maersk Alabama a giant freighter bound for Kenya. This means traversing pirate-infested waters off the Somalian coast. Once out in the ocean Phillips wary of the threat orders a security drill. Halfway through it ceases to be a practice as pirate boats right on cue approach. One of them is outwitted but the other persists and soon enough thanks to a long ladder deployed like old-fashioned grappling irons the Maersk is boarded. Its crew of twenty is pursued and pinned down by a mere quartet of armed men. Their leader Muse (Barkhad Abdi) tells Phillips to relax adding ""Im the captain now."" A ransom of ten million dollars is demanded. The stage is set. Throughout this the Greengrass paradox is on display how can so confusing a situation seem so clear? Only Spielberg can match him in the ability to lay out conditions and terms. At no point as hunter and prey converge do we fail to grasp who is where and what is happening. If the welter of closeups--of faces maps guns and instrument dials--grows too intense the camera retreats for a few calming seconds to an aerial view allowing us to watch the Alabama from above or afar being shadowed and pestered by the enemy skiff. As the plot unfolds the irony of that mismatch starts to grow. Help is summoned and the full might of American power is brought to bear. Meanwhile the action switches to one of the freighters lifeboats which carries the attackers and a single bewildered hostage. And thus we are granted the spectacle of an aircraft carrier two warships and a contingent of Navy SEALs parachuting out of the sky all in pursuit of a little orange tub which bobs like a cork upon the waves. If the crisis werent so deadly it would be a joke. ""Captain Phillips"" which is based on real events of 2009 poses a problem for Greengrass. Hitherto his work has exuded a spirit of testy liberal complaint scornful of cabals coverups and the darker arts of government. And what do we have now? Vermont Man versus the Somalis. To return to my opening distinction the story begins as one kind of Greengrass film about an ordinary joe and then hardens into the other kind equipped with unswayable snipers and stone-jawed commanders whose idea of a windy rhetorical speech is ""Execute."" Its the old Hollywood conundrum how does a left-wing conscience find room to maneuver in a right-wing form? The screenplay by Billy Ray is not much help. The thinnest of backgrounds is supplied for the hijackers who are said to be fishermen and who talk of their crimes as if still plying that trade. (""We caught a ship last week."") There is no avoiding the fact these are desperadoes from a dysfunctional land who terrorize in the hope of reward. And Muse--gaunt of frame and burning of gaze--is a seriously frightening foe. Why then do we not feel bullied by the result? Partly because the camera as I say tells a subtler tale than the dialogue does and lures us into a grudging respect for the bravado of Muse and his men; but mainly because of Tom Hanks. This most likable of actors deliberately presents us with a character who makes no effort to be liked. A warmer and wiser guy would have tipped the scales of the movie--we would have rooted for him and for the triumph of American virtue ahead of any ordeal. Phillips is brisk to the point of rudeness with his crew; he is pragmatic but easily spooked and heroic by default; he is the anti-Bourne. The rubbery mug of the young Hanks is barely discernible behind spectacles and a badger-gray beard yet that early comic training pays dividends in his extraordinary final scene. There is not a jot of humor in it--just the opposite--but his control of physical detail as Phillips is buffeted by the shocks that flesh is heir to has lost none of its force. Twenty-five years ago in ""Big"" Hanks gave us a boy who became a man overnight; now in ""Captain Phillips"" he gives us a man so shaken and sickened by adventure--by the high seas of adult experience--that for a while despite himself he turns back into a child. The title of Peter Landesmans ""Parkland"" refers to Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas. John F. Kennedy was taken there after being shot on November 22 1963 as was Lee Harvey Oswald two days later. Much of the movie--a feature film though it uses scraps of documentary footage--takes place in the hospital where Jim Carrico (Zac Efron) a first-year surgical resident aided by a team that includes the emergency-room supervisor Doris Nelson (Marcia Gay Harden) struggles in vain to save the Presidents life. Efron has a good moment near the start when Carrico seizes up immobilized at the gravity of what he is being asked to do; then he shakes himself like a dog and gets to work. Other locations play no less a role. There are two important offices one from which Abraham Zapruder (Paul Giamatti) grabbing his hat goes out to film the motorcade and another where Robert Oswald (James Badge Dale) first hears his brothers name on the radio after Lees arrest. There is also a Kodak lab to which Zapruder is escorted by the authorities so that his film can be processed in a rush; the motel to which Robert and his mother (Jacki Weaver) a world-class fruitcake are moved for their own safety; and Love Field where the casket containing the body is loaded onto Air Force One with a gasping effort that borders on black comedy. What we dont properly understand--in contrast to ""Captain Phillips""--is how these places relate to one another. The film feels like a parade of comings and goings and you could be forgiven for thinking that Dallas was an oversized village. Dramatically that scurrying has an unfortunate effect. Landesman rarely allows himself to linger on one strand of the tale and let it take root. I always thought that Zapruder deserved a movie to himself imagine his regular routines gradually established in our minds and then disrupted with such brutal suddenness that he is never the same again. Here surely was the chance for that movie with Giamatti a great screen actor easing into the role as though he were donning a made-to-measure suit. And what do we get? Hurried scenes splurges of information disguised as dialogue (""Eighteen frames a second"" Zapruder cries camera in hand) and a closeup of his eyes as he watches his handiwork being screened. Only later as he offers it to Life adding ""Youre going to have to pay for it"" does the tautness of his character emerge. The pact may not be Faustian but there is a definite squirm of the soul. How could an amateur make the most closely observed film of the twentieth century and stay sane? ""Parkland"" sadly does not repay equal scrutiny. Kennedy specialists will glean nothing new and those hoping for sobriety will flinch at the cameras intrusions. The film seems tasteless in both senses--bland and impersonal as it searches for a core to the story yet ready to home in on the portions of skull and brain matter that Doris Nelson hands to an assistant. Some of the actors project a genuine intensity but many of them like Billy Bob Thornton who plays a Secret Service agent and Jackie Earle Haley as a priest simply dont get the chance. And so as the solemnity of the enterprise is frittered away you feel moved to ask what is this film for?  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Photo Columbia Pictures Movie Review 4 out of 4 Stars. Thrills ahoy. Running time 133 minutes. In English and Somali with English subtitles. Rated PG-13 (intense bloody violence drugs). At the Ziegfeld the Empire the Union Square others. Tom Hanks does his finest work ever in Paul Greengrass gripping docu-drama ""Captain Phillips -- brilliantly playing  Richard Phillips the abducted veteran skipper of the Maersk Alabama held hostage for four days in 2009 by armed Somali hijackers after he foiled their determined attempt to capture his enormous cargo ship. The story which made international headlines is brought to vivid life by Greengrass who stages the complex but clearly depicted action on an actual cargo ship as well as on real Navy vessels including one that was involved in the rescue mission. The hijackers are a quartet of poor Somali fishermen who dont know each other before they are recruited onshore and frequently bicker as things go increasingly wrong. Muse (Barkhad Abdi) is the intense leader who struggles to make a team of the hotheaded Najee (Faysal Ahmed) terrified navigator Elmi (Mahat M. Ali) and barefoot teenager Bilal (Barkhad Abdirahman) who clearly has no idea what hes gotten himself into. Phillips helming a Norfolk Va.-based ship is transporting hundreds of cargo containers from Oman to Kenya and conducting an anti-piracy drill when he spots a couple of suspicious skiffs approaching from the Somali coast. Unarmed (per international maritime regulations at the time) Phillips orders whatever evasive measures are possible for his huge and slow-moving vessel which uses water cannons to try to swamp the interlopers. Faysal Ahmen Barkhad Abdi Barkhad Abdirahman and Mahat Ali play Somali pirates in ""Captain Phillips.""Photo AP One of the skiffs is scared off but another with this desperate quartet manages to get close enough to hook on a ladder in the roiling surf and board. Phillips offers 30000 in cash but it isnt enough to satisfy Muse who conducts a search for the hidden crew -- whom the quick-thinking Phillips has ordered to shut down the engines. With the US Navy approaching and two of their number injured the hijackers (who speak limited English) grab Phillips and take off in a hot and claustrophobic motorized lifeboat with fantasies of ransoming the captain -- whom Muse calls ""Irish -- for millions. Meanwhile a team of negotiators and Navy SEALs has been assembled to rescue the very clever Phillips who at one point makes a desperate escape attempt under cover of pitch-black night. Though the outcome is very well known there are plenty of white-knuckle thrills in this very detailed retelling of this real-life story (Billy Rays screenplay is based on a memoir co-written by Phillips) which takes place largely in very close quarters as well as on the open sea. Aside from Hanks (and Catherine Keener seen briefly in the opening scene as Phillips concerned wife) the cast consists of largely unfamiliar faces including powerful and low-profile character actors playing the principal Navy personnel (alongside actual sailors). Though this apolitical film in no way condones piracy Greengrass (who directed the superb ""United 93) elicits a measure of sympathy for the naively overmatched Somali hijackers who fear their employer as much as their target drawing nuanced performances from a quartet of inexperienced actors. It falls to Hanks and his movie-star presence to anchor this ambitious enterprise and he does some of his most impressive acting without saying a word. I watched transfixed as Phillips constantly surveys his uneasy captors and calculates his strategies and his rapidly dwindling chances of survival. Just when I thought he couldnt get any better Hanks tops himself in a devastating final sequence in which we see a man who is unable to process all that hes been through -- though were told Phillips was back on the job a year later.

(Courtesy of Columbia Pictures.) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Friday September 27 2013 200 AM Title Captain Phillips Film Info With Tom Hanks. An American skipper fights off Somali pirates. Director Paul Greengrass. (214) PG-13 Violence. Opens the New York Film Festival Friday; at area theaters starting Oct. 11. ""Captain Phillips"" unfurls with an intensity that knocks the wind out of you. Director Paul Greengrass film -- which opens the 51st New York Film Festival tonight before hitting theaters Oct. 11 -- is the most gripping based-on-fact film so far this year. In turning a nonfiction book into a high-tension action-drama Greengrass (""United 93"" ""The Green Zone"") has made cinematic gold. Its like a sea-bound ""Dog Day Afternoon"" only with the hostages as the heroes. But instead of a milquetoast middle manager the title character is played with guts and gusto by Tom Hanks. Hanks Phillips is a career seaman with a wife (Catherine Keener) in Vermont and two kids in college. In March 2009 he takes a job helming a cargo vessel from Oman to Kenya. Their course takes them around the Horn of Africa an area bedeviled by pirates. Phillips a no-nonsense guy warns his crew. Their preparations are crucial as theyre soon attacked by two skiffs carrying Somali men with guns. Smart maneuvering buys time but the pirates are able to board. Theyre few in number but theyre driven to steal money and cargo and theyre armed. Phillips ship has no weapons. From left Mahat Ali Tom Hanks and Faysal Ahmed in ""Captain Phillips"" (Jasin Boland) The Somalis it turns out arent very good at piracy. But their captain Muse (a terrific Barkhad Abdi) is driven to prove himself hoping to tamp down internal power struggles. The ship has only 30000 on it -- Muse is hoping for millions -- and as confusion and violence break out the pirates take Phillips and flee in a protected metal lifeboat. Captive and captors fight to control this messed-up situation as Navy SEALs bear down to save Phillips whos at the end of his rope. Greengrass and screenwriter Billy Ray make the film a tough standoff between the two captains a meditation on masculinity. Before the raid Muse a fisherman reluctantly goes to sea only after village thugs threaten him. The desperation of the pirates draws events out and Muse to save face dares not back down. Hanks lets his natural affability work as a smokescreen here. Yet he like the man he plays is cagey and doesnt tip his hand too soon. While never endangering his mainstream appeal Hanks has proven himself to be one of the most daring A-list American actors in ""Philadelphia"" ""Saving Private Ryan"" ""Road to Perdition"" the great ""Cast Away"" even the thoughtfully odd ""Cloud Atlas."" In much of ""Captain Phillips"" his heroism is submerged. This is a guy who thinks on his feet and lets a cooler head serve as his best defense. Barkhad Abdirahman left and Barkhad Abdi in ""Captain Phillips"" (SMPSP/Hopper Stone ) When he finally lets loose however there is well-earned pent-up rage -- and it comes after this incredible action-drama has cruised to speeds you have to see to believe.

"Review A riveting Captain Phillips - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview A riveting Captain PhillipsBy Charlie McCollum StaffPosted 10/07/2013 060000 AM PDTUpdated 10/11/2013 060308 PM PDT Related StoriesOct 10Tom Hanks has made a career out of playing regular guysOct 8Tom Hanks reveals he has Type 2 diabetesIts not easy to make a film out of real-life events and turn it into a gripping thriller -- especially when most of your audience knows the ending.However its not impossible. Last year Kathryn Bigelow did it with ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and Ben Affleck with ""Argo."" Steven Spielberg even did it in a way with ""Lincoln.""Now director Paul Greengrass has turned the trick with ""Captain Phillips"" a harrowing re-creation of the 2009 hijacking of an American freighter by Somali pirates. With some considerable help from star Tom Hanks as the ships captain Richard Phillips Greengrass has taken Phillips ordeal and made it a vivid tale of an everymans battle for survival in the midst of what turned into an international incident.Greengrass doesnt waste too much time setting the scene. Phillips a veteran sailor says goodbye to his wife (a brief appearance by Catherine Keener) before flying to take command of the Maersk Alabama a ship that is carrying a cargo largely made up of food and other supplies for charitable organizations working in Africa. His job is to sail the freighter from southern Oman to Kenya -- right through waters off the coast of Somalia.At the same time on the beach in the city of Eyl Somali pirates are getting organized to take to the seas looking for hijacking targets. Most are former fishermen who see piracy as a way out of poverty; even then some take on the job only reluctantly.Advertisement As Phillips sails down the coast -- it becomes clear very quickly that he has deep concerns about the lack of security on the boat -- the pirates set off in skiffs commanded by Muse (a very good Barkhad Abdi). Muses crew is hardly a crack military team. The men barely know each other something that becomes very clear as the film progresses and internal bickering breaks out among the Somalis.But the crew is good enough to spot and track the Maersk Alabama. Phillips and his men thwart one attack (one skiff turns back) but Muse and three other pirates eventually board and take over the ship. For his part Phillips manages to hide most of his crew in the bowels of the massive freighter (a pirate search for men is a tense beautifully crafted bit of filmmaking).Things unravel quickly for Muse and his pirates. The crew manages to disable the ship. However the U.S. Navy is in pursuit and closing fast. Two of the pirates -- Muse and the young Bilal (Barkhad Abdirahman) -- are injured. With their hijacking unraveling the pirates grab Phillips and take off in one of the ships high-tech lifeboats for the Somali coast. At least the pirates can still get a handsome ransom for the captain. It all comes down to a climactic showdown at sea involving the lifeboat multiple Navy ships attack helicopters and a crack team of SEALs. The ending is so dramatic that it seems like a piece of fiction -- except thats the way things turned out in real life.At the heart of the drama is the battle of wits between Phillips and Muse. The two men both fundamentally decent souls parry and thrust as the crisis boils around them. Aside from a very bad Boston accent that comes and goes Hanks is superb as Phillips who in a nuanced performance conveys the mans intelligence and drive to survive. Abdi a Somali emigre living in America making his film debut captures Muses street smarts and his ambivalence toward the life he has to lead.Working with a sharp script drawn from Phillips memoir by Billy Ray (""Shattered Glass"") and crack cinematographer Barry Ackroyd (""The Hurt Locker"") Greengrass has treated his source material with respect shaping an intelligent spellbinding drama. Few directors are better at re-creating real-life events; he proved that with 2006s extraordinary ""United 93"" the best of all the 9/11 films and with 2002s ""Bloody Sunday"" set in the worst days of the Irish-British conflict.However Greengrass lean-and-mean approach to the story does lead to the films one flaw. There is very little background and context to ""Captain Phillips"" with no examination of the politics of the region what drives the Somalis or the willingness of international shipping companies to keep sending largely unprotected ships into harms way. For that youll have to find last years ""A Hijacking"" from Danish director Tobias Lindholm which is not nearly as pulse-pounding but is far more complex. Tom Hanks in ""Captain Phillips"" (Hopper Stone/SMPSP/Columbia Pictures) Still the flaw is not a fatal one. ""Captain Phillips"" will grab and hold your attention from its first few minutes to its startling conclusion.For film news and more follow Charlie McCollum at Twitter.com/charlie_mccollu.CAPTAIN PHILLIPS    1/2Rating PG-13 (for intense sequences and some violence)Cast Tom Hanks Barkhad Abdi Max Martini and Catherine KeenerDirector Paul GreengrassRunning time 2 hours 13 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Review Holocaust haunts family in The GatheringReview In Hearts of Palm bumbling corporation aims to plunder paradiseReview In Bad Moms fast food and booze spike the stress of motherhood Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

(Credit Columbia Pictures) Considered on its most obvious merits ""Captain Phillips"" - which opened the New York Film Festival on Friday night -- is an intense and claustrophobic maritime adventure much of it set not on the open sea but inside a sealed lifeboat that resembles a small submarine or a floating coffin. It may well earn Tom Hanks the Oscar nomination hes so clearly striving for in depicting the almost Christ-like suffering of the eponymous Capt. Rich Phillips a taciturn New Englander who is taken hostage by Somali pirates after a 2009 hijacking goes awry. But not far below the surface ""Captain Phillips"" is also an unpleasant and uncomfortable experience a film thats not entirely happy with itself.Director Paul Greengrass a specialist in political thrillers who made ""United 93"" ""Bloody Sunday"" and the second and third Bourne adventures has never before made anything this propagandistic or this characterless. His portrayal of the enormous United States military operation to free Phillips from his captors has the calm technological blankness of a Navy commercial without the 1970s waka-waka guitar. I cant decide if theres meant to be anything sardonic about the presentation of the asymmetrical conflict in ""Captain Phillips"" Billions of dollars of cutting-edge military hardware and hundreds of corn-fed gym-toned Americans on one side four malnourished men with black-market Kalashnikovs on the other. But I kind of think there isnt.Im aware that Billy Rays screenplay is based on the memoir by the real-life Richard Phillips who joined Hanks and Greengrass onstage at Lincoln Center before the films world premiere. But what we have here is a movie not exactly a ""true story"" and as cinema it plays a lot like a knockoff of ""Zero Dark Thirty"" without the same ambition and scale and with dramatically lower stakes. Instead of a worldwide ""terrorist"" conspiracy that at least notionally advocates violent apocalypse the boogeymen in ""Captain Phillips"" are a quartet of impoverished villagers who barely know each other ordered out to sea in a wooden skiff by the local warlord in search of a quick cash-grab.Ray and Greengrass include a brief scene on the beach in Somalia to make clear that the pirates - like Rich Phillips and his crew - are essentially employees in a capitalist enterprise doing what theyre told. But that isnt how it plays out on the water despite the calming assurances of rail-skinny Muse (Barkhad Abdi) captain of this pirate band that the whole thing is ""just business"" and nobody will get hurt. I dont know enough about the social world of Somali piracy to judge whether these four guys were unusually ill-prepared but it kind of seems that way. I can tell you that the outstanding Danish film ""A Hijacking"" offers a far more nuanced and textured story about the relationship among the Somali pirates between the pirates and the hostage crew and about how the shipping industry deals with this particular hazard.Without getting into spoiler-land what seems to have happened in this now-famous 2009 incident was that the Somali guys had eyes bigger than their stomachs so to speak. They got an eyeful of Phillips vessel the Maersk Alabama an enormous American container ship loaded with cargo - it was en route from Oman to Mombasa Kenya - and just couldnt say no. But the Alabama had a large and well-trained crew who had rehearsed a strategy for resisting pirates. Even after the Somalis successfully board the ship they never quite gain control of it. Four untrained and anxious dudes even with automatic weapons were never likely to win an extended cat-and-mouse game aboard a huge oceangoing vessel they didnt understand and couldnt operate. You Might Also Like I suspect this may be part of Greengrass design for the film In a way the Somalis fate was decided as soon as they tried to tackle a U.S.-flag carrier. All the shipping companies were getting tired of paying out millions in ransom to the freelance taxing authorities of Somalia and were delighted to let the U.S. military take on all the trouble and expense of making an example of this particular band. In ""A Hijacking"" on the other hand there is never any suggestion that the U.S. or any other nation will intervene militarily to rescue a third-rate freighter from an insignificant European country. Its an arduous and unpleasant negotiation but always a question of business How much money will it take and how much time? When violence occurs in that film its understood by all parties as an unfortunate miscalculation collateral damage of the business deal.After an awkward and gratuitous opening scene depicting Phillips at home in Vermont with his wife (a cameo for Catherine Keener) Hanks largely gives a quiet but commanding performance as a man who is used to controlling events and must give that up entirely. Phillips is depicted as a curt plain-spoken man a taskmaster who has little emotional connection with his crew but who must suddenly thrust himself into the role of self-sacrificing hero. Again while I know this movie sticks close to the facts theres clearly a metaphorical level to Phillips ordeal with the pirates who end up escaping from the Alabama in one of its lifeboats with him as their prisoner. He survives but at immense cost and seared by trauma his relationship to life and the world changed in unknowable terms. (In fact the real Rich Phillips went back to sea a year later.) Theres a racial or cultural subtext to this film thats right on the boundary of consciousness and cannot entirely be ascribed to verisimilitude. Hanks Phillips - the only fully realized character in the entire film - remains a calm and rational actor until he is pushed to the limit of human endurance. The Navy officers SEAL team members and other military personnel are competent emotionless automata seen mostly in shadows or illuminated by their electronic gizmos. But the Somalis behave like unmedicated hyperactive children with guns - theyre wild-eyed and hot-tempered vacillating from murderous rage to companionable good humor and back again every few seconds.

Paul Greengrass cinema-of-spasticity reaches new phony lows with Captain Phillips a based-on-true-life 2008 tale of a cargo ship captain (Tom Hanks) who while traveling around the horn of Africa finds his vessel attacked by Somali pirates led by Muse (Barkhad Abdi). From its opening Vermont-set conversation between Phillips and his wife (Catherine Keener) Greengrass film - written by Billy Ray and based on the real Phillips memoir- proves itself interested only in flat expository dialogue with every uttered word chosen to impart vital plot information character detail and simplistic First-vs.-Third World commentary. That conversational falseness is matched by the United 93 and The Bourne Identity filmmakers usual handheld cinematography which bobs and weaves with a shakiness that aims for you-are-there docu-realism but too often gets in the way of the drama at hand. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Doggedly cutting or panning away from Hanks to the point that theres little chance for an authentic performance to blossom on-screen Greengrass camerawork is so consistently unstable and nauseating [insert obligatory sea-sickness joke here] that it proves not a reflection of its protagonists anxieties but instead merely an affection that undermines its own effectiveness by calling such attention to itself. That sort of self-sabotage is part and parcel of Captain Phillips which turns its character dynamics hokey by so bluntly paralleling Phillips and Muse - both presented as committed leaders who assume their missions begrudgingly and are forced to contend with squabbling (and in Muses case screamy) underlings - and negates its cat-and-mouse tension on the ship and race-against-time suspense on a life raft by turning its last act into one long preordained build-up to rah-rah Navy SEAL heroism.

A macro-economic horror story in the guise of an exceptionally harrowing hostage thriller Paul Greengrass ""Captain Phillips"" dramatizes a 2009 incident in which a small band of Somali pirates hijacked an American cargo ship a siege that has since become emblematic of the recent rise in similar armed attacks. Anchored by a compellingly candid titular performance by Tom Hanks (his best on-screen work since ""Larry Crowne"" ""Catch Me if You Can"") Greengrass latest recreation of recent historys most vividly violent events is not - as its awkward opening moments might first suggest - just another Hollywood celebration of American bravado at the expense of faceless third-world foreigners. On the contrary ""Captain Phillips"" is not only a masterful action movie that breathlessly and believably re-stages a tense standoff at sea but a resonant portrait of systemized financial imbalance trickling down into the water. While this is arguably Greengrass best film its almost certainly his most urgent. The films ungainly first scene is less of a personal introduction than it is an economic one acquainting us with the strikingly ordinary Captain Rich Phillips on a gray spring morning as he prepares to leave his quaint Vermont home for his latest international assignment. The Captains wife (the great Catherine Keener appearing here in a perfunctory cameo that only feels necessary in retrospect) drives him down the interstate in their minivan depositing her husband at the airport and sending him across the planet with a kiss and a plea to return safely. Billy Rays script then transports us to the shores of Somalia where the naturally gaunt Muse (first-time actor Barkhad Abdi in a brilliantly convincing performance) and a few other gun-toting men from his village volunteer their services as mercenaries for a local warlord. Less than a few minutes of screen time later Muse and his fellow pirates make their first attempt to plow their ramshackle skiffs through the choppy wake of Captain Phillips hulking cargo ship. Their plan assuming theyre able to climb aboard the corporate vessel is to hold the blue-collar crew hostage for 10 million. Of course if the movies have taught us anything about the hostage business its that things seldom go according to plan. The collision between first and third world is set up with a didactic inevitability reminiscent of more conventionally entertaining fare like ""Warrior"" but theres nevertheless a palpable truth to the marked contrast between two men going to work at very different jobs. Neither Muse nor Captain Phillips are revealed in great detail as both are chiefly defined by circumstance and the available means by which they might take advantage of their strengths and respective educations to earn a living wage. Little is done to wring the viewers sympathy for Muse (he doesnt have a dying younger brother in desperate need of expensive medical care or anything like that) and just as little is done to demonize him. More crucially Rays script doesnt attempt to forcible redistribute whatever natural favor Western audiences might have for Captain Phillips towards Muse in the third act - central to the films power is how Ray mercifully assumes that the audience respects Muses basic humanity the story refusing to repeat the mistakes of ""Fruitvale Station"" and spend its duration earning an empathy that ought to be self-evident. Shot in Greengrass signature hectic and handheld style aboard ships identical to the ones on which the incident actually occurred ""Captain Phillips"" becomes a relentlessly anxious experience from the moment the Somali skiffs first blip onto the outer edges of the freighters radar. The narrow labyrinthine corridors of Phillips freighter naturally are a perfect compliment for the unmoored intimacy of Greengrass style - ""United 93"" proved that the ""Bourne Supremacy"" director could subdue his fetish for shaky-cam but ""Captain Phillips"" introduces more complex spaces and simultaneous planes of parallel action and Greengrass is more than up to the task. In much the same way that the introduction of 3D to the ""Transformers"" franchise forced Michael Bay to make the action in ""Dark of the Moon"" markedly more coherent than it was in the series previous installments ""Captain Phillips"" powder keg suspense and its attendant sense of false calm provide the circumstances Greengrass required to marry the documentary immediacy of his compositions with a tactically precise sense of organized space. The viewer always knows what theyre seeing and how it relates to the surrounding environment - because we feel endowed with the same visual information as the characters we feel confident enough to consider what each partys next move should be Greengrass direction finally achieving the immediacy that many ""verite"" filmmakers wrongly assume is implicit to their approach. As a result ""Captain Phillips"" is a film so tense that it makes ""Gravity"" feel like a foot massage. If the films New York Film Festival premiere was any indication many viewers will be moved to tears as the centrifugal force of the narrative finally tapers during the end credits the accumulated weight of the trauma theyve just witnessed sinking unto their shoulders. Minor spoilers for this true-life story follow. Ultimately however ""Captain Phillips"" transcends the taint of hollow spectacle that so often accompanies docudramas about recent events because Ray and Greengrass both understand that this isnt a film about how these men will get escape from one situation its a film about how theyll always be victims of another. While some (otherwise astute) reviews have cited the film as yet another beaming portrait of American exceptionalism its a bit myopic to think that the film equates right with might. In fact the force and precision of the U.S. Navy (who eventually enter the picture from sea and sky alike wielding all sorts of overpowered weaponry) embarrass the feeble and panicked Somali squad to such an extent that the films climactic moments terrifyingly stressed as they are are also morbidly comedic. One of the pirates is a 16-year-old kid who hijacks Captain Phillips freighter barefoot because he cant even afford sandals - the sniper who has the kid in the sight of his night-vision rifle arrived on the scene by parachuting from a stealth fighter. This isnt David vs. Goliath this is the Washington Generals vs. the Harlem Globetrotters. Americas armed forces have every conceivable tool required to defuse this kind of situation - theyve done it before and theyll do it again. But for all of the billions upon billions of dollars that we spend on our military we still cant spend our way out of the deeply ingrained economic disparity that stratifies our planet into different financial worlds that forces children to become soldiers and men to become pirates. Americans are experts at scooping water out of a sinking ship if only we knew how to plug the leak. While the food aid on Captain Phillips boat would surely have saved a handful of lives had it reached its final destination the compromise implicit in Muses ultimate fate is damning proof that some solutions are just bigger problems in disguise.

TWITTER Paul Greengrass and Tom Hanks team up for a pulsating account of the kidnapping of the captain of an American cargo ship by Somali pirates. From Gravity to All Is Lost and 12 Years a Slave tis the season for survival stories and another good one joins this classy club with Captain Phillips a pulsating account of the kidnapping of the captain of an American cargo ship by Somali pirates. Something of a companion piece for director Paul Greengrass to his superb United 93 which was based on the real-life takeover of one of the 9/11 aircraft this immaculately made reconstruction of a chaotic incident will have a much better time of it commercially than the earlier film due to the presence of star Tom Hanks and because it has a happy ending. Set to world premiere as the opening-night attraction of the New York Film Festival on Sept. 27 the Sony release will go out commercially Oct. 11. With his irrepressibly kinetic style Greengrass could probably make the opening of a cereal box exciting so it was almost a no-brainer that he could successfully handle a story like this which features not only logistical challenges but the sort of volatile political backdrop he has favored in most of his work. Still for a story that pits locals versus Americans in the Middle East and boasts a climax that involves Navy SEALs U.S. choppers and warships the taut screenplay by Billy Ray (Shattered Glass The Hunger Games) essentially makes no mention of religion al-Qaida or the war on terror concentrating on the more essential reality of impoverished young men some of them fishermen pushed to extreme measures by the big bucks bandit bosses offer for Western hostages for whom they can demand millions. Its ""just business"" as so many criminals throughout history have said. PHOTOS 25 of Falls Most Anticipated Movies And so it is for Hanks Richard Phillips a middle-aged civilian captain who bids his wife (Catherine Keener) adieu in Vermont in late March 2009 to take an enormous container ship from southern Oman down along the coast of Somalia and then to Kenya. Unusually for a vessel in these waters its an American ship the Maersk Alabama out of Norfolk manned by a U.S. crew. Phillips is curt with his crew members and given the rash of pirate attacks of late extremely attentive to security matters. He doesnt say it in so many words but its clear Phillips just wants to get this job done as quickly as possible collect his check and go home. On the beach in the pirate city of Eyl Somalia voyages of a different sort are being organized by shouting rifle-toting young African men recruiting crews to hijack large vessels out at sea and bring back money as well as hostages who might be exchanged for very large ransoms. Dozens of mostly skinny guys in their teens and 20s eagerly volunteer for action; in short order enough to man two skiffs are selected. The usual Greengrass skill is evident with the diverse settings and mix of languages and accents the combination of technologies high and low the laying out of logistics and constant movement from place to place and the outer limits of human resilience and endurance in dealing with severe threats to them. The director has long since mastered relaying exposition as economically as possible and visually he and ace cinematographer Barry Ackroyd make the tiny open motorboats that pursue the hulking graceless container ship look like minnows bird-dogging a whale. VIDEO Tom Hanks Negotiates With Pirates in Captain Phillips Trailer As it happens the alert Captain Phillips notices the two boats bearing down on him just as hes conducting an attack preparation drill. As the Alabama moves very slowly and has limited maneuverability theres not much the crew can do but slowly shift course and fire big water hoses at the marauders -- rather incredibly in these waters a merchant vessel carries no arms. Discouraged by increasingly rough seas one skiff turns back but the other perseveres enabling four pirates to climb aboard using a ladder they hook to the ships side. Thus ensues a cat-and-mouse game in which the crew hides in the engine room while Phillips called ""Irish"" by the bony buck-toothed ringleader Muse (Barkhad Abdi) tries to stall for time. Whenever they sense any games are being played the pirates go into paroxysms of ranting and raving and soon enough Phillips offers them the 30000 in cash he has on hand to call it a day. But the hothead of the group Najee (Faysal Ahmed) knows better insisting they hold out for millions since all these ships are insured for just such an incident. As Muse and the youngest pirate Bilal (Barkhad Abdirahman) are injured and a big U.S. Navy vessel is moving in the pirates shortly take off with their most valuable asset Captain Phillips in an orange ugly-looking lifeboat in which they hope to reach the Somali coast within 36 hours. As tempers fray and conditions become suffocating in this little shell of a craft the American military goes into a full-court press dispatching more boats as well as Navy SEALs to the scene to try to rescue Phillips. ANALYSIS Why Tom Hanks Captain Phillips Is Opening the New York Film Fest Since this military operation was big news in April 2009 the outcome is no surprise. However if the film accurately depicts how it went down it was even more hair-breadth and last-second than was generally reported. But more powerful even than that is Hanks stunned response to the attack and his emotional aftermath. Hysteria delayed reaction wordless silence -- these have been seen many times in dramatized accounts of traumatic events. But Hanks has come up with something different a rendering of a state of shock quite unique in which his altered condition stands in extreme contrast to the routine questions and reassurances of the attending nurse. Its an extraordinary scene one for which there is little precedent. The presentation of the four pirates who speak in their local language as well as in some English is both interesting and a bit predictable. These are young men -- or in at least one case a teenager -- who didnt know one another before being selected for the mission and they spend a lot of time criticizing and bickering. Muse establishes a measure of rapport with Phillips frequently assuring him they dont mean to harm him no matter how frequently the wild-eyed Najee shouts and waves a gun in his face while Bilal is mostly hobbled with his injury and skipper Elmi (Mahat M. Ali) seems petrified driving no matter what craft hes in. The film rips right along and never relinquishes its grip. The format of the last-minute heroics goes back to the earliest Westerns and could well be accused of patness or being cliched -- other than for the fact that its what happened. Unsurprisingly though the director indulges in no jingoistic rah-rah stuff with the Navy even if it has not often been the case that American military operations in the Middle East have come off exactly as planned. Craftsmanship and technical contributions are first-rate all the way while Henry Jackmans electronic score throbs underneath most of the action.

Blame Riddick 7 of Falls Burning Box-Office Questions Will Horror Rule Again? Can Tom Hanks Get His Groove Back? Director Paul Greengrass portrayal here of a noble white officer suffering at the hands of insidious black pirates smacks of Rudyard Kipling The best docu-dramas have a gift for taking a story we think we know and showing us the many layers that we dont. So while you may remember the news story from a few years ago the one where Navy SEALs snipers took out three Somali pirates who were holding an American boat captain hostage screenwriter Billy Ray (""Shattered Glass"" ""The Hunger Games"") and director Paul Greengrass""gt;Paul Greengrass (""The Bourne Supremacy"") put us right in the thick of the action in ""Captain Phillips."" Based on Richard Phillips and Stephen Taltys memoir ""A Captains Duty Somali Pirates Navy SEALs and Dangerous Days at Sea"" this movie evokes the terror of Phillips captivity with the kind of immersive storytelling for which Greengrass has become known. But while the filmmakers capture their hero through both words and deeds they fail to paint as vivid a portrait of their villains. Also read Tom Hanks Squares Off Against Somali Pirates in Captain Phillips Trailer The story in and of itself is a gripping one In the spring of 2009 Phillips (played here with unfussy humanity by Tom Hanks) was shepherding the cargo ship Maersk Alabama around the horn of Africa when it was set upon by Somali pirates. The captain and his crew managed to elude the raiders on their first pass but the following day the marauders boarded the ship. Unable to access the ships cargo and fought to a standstill by the crew the pirates instead took Phillips hostage intending to transport him to Somalia to be ransomed by the insurance company. After several days in a lifeboat -- an enclosed vessel not like the ones youve seen in ""Life of Pi"" or Hitchcocks ""Lifeboat"" -- Phillips was eventually rescued by the Navy. Also read 7 of Falls Burning Box-Office Questions Will Horror Rule Again? Can Tom Hanks Get His Groove Back? It takes real skill to build genuine suspense when telling a story the ending of which everyone already knows but Ray and Greengrass keep us on our toes mainly by portraying the pirates as dangerous opponents even when theyre surrounded by aircraft carriers. But while Phillips comes off as resourceful brave and dedicated his captors more often than not resemble zombies -- Greengrass often shoots them in a way that makes their eyes invisible rendering them soulless. The groups leader Muse (Barkhad Abdi) gets in a few lines about how his people are victimized by larger nations (who have overfished the waters) and the local warlords (who pocket whatever fortunes these pirates manage to pilfer) but he mostly comes off as a mere monster constantly chewing khat leaves and glowering. Greengrass is obviously no colonist -- his ""Bloody Sunday"" was an impassioned tale of Northern Ireland bearing the brunt of British violence -- but his portrayal here of a noble white officer suffering at the hands of insidious black pirates smacks of Rudyard Kipling. Also read Paul Greengrass Defends the Big Budget Tentpole Machine"" target=""_blank""gt;Bourne Director Paul Greengrass Defends the Big Budget Tentpole Machine Still its a fine showcase for Hanks who captures the captains quiet authority in calm seas his fortitude under duress and his overwhelming shock when the ordeal ends. Its too bad his most extended bit of dialogue is a horribly written exchange with the missus (played by Catherine Keener in a terrible wig) in which they speak in the broadest terms about the world today and things sure are rough and all. His performance picks up substantially once he leaves the suburbs and assumes command of the bridge. ""Captain Phillips"" will no doubt draw comparisons to ""Zero Dark Thirty"" for its ripped-from-the-headlines storytelling but this is a case in which the writer and director are as interested in the human element as they are in the true events theyre recounting. Its too bad that they couldnt have made their real-life bad guys as multi-dimensional as their hero.

Four years after it made headlines the harrowing ordeal of commercial shipping captain Richard Phillips gets the bigscreen treatment care of verite specialist Paul Greengrass in ""Captain Phillips."" The result is a kinetic docudrama that always impresses without ever connecting emotionally in quite the same way as the helmers prior ""Bloody Sunday"" and ""United 93"" with which ""Phillips"" forms a loose trilogy of average Joes and Janes caught in the throes of politically motivated violence. Setting sail with an opening-night berth at the New York Film Festival (where another seafaring epic ""Life of Pi"" launched last year) this impeccably well-made gripping but grim survival tale should spark a flurry of awards buzz for star Tom Hanks and powerful Somali newcomer Barkhad Abdi but may prove too grueling to make major waves with Academy voters or the multiplex crowd.This story first appeared in the September 10 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. Working from a script by Billy Ray (""Breach"" ""Shattered Glass"") drawn from Phillips own memoir Greengrass traces the captains ill-fated journey on and off the container ship Maersk Alabama beginning with his April 2009 departure from the port of Oman and ending with his dramatic rescue off the Somali coast after four days in captivity. The only reference to Phillips personal life comes in a brief but excellent scene between Hanks and Catherine Keener (playing Mrs. Phillips) rich in its sense of the comfort between two long-married people their conversation about their childrens future masking a far deeper concern about Phillips high-risk profession. Indeed ""Captain Phillips"" makes it clear that Phillips was worried from the outset about the possibility of pirate attack -- and the Alabamas lack of security -- well before leaving port which gives the ultimate turn of events a touch of Cassandra-like prophecy. The pirates (who also get one too-brief context-establishing scene on the Somalia mainland) first arrive in two small skiffs ill-equipped to challenge the Alabamas speed though its a clever bit of radio theater concocted by Phillips that ultimately thwarts them. But the crew knows its only a matter of time before their unwanted visitors return -- which they do in a sharply executed setpiece that pits the undersized skiff (just one this time with four occupants) against the Alabamas pressurized water jets and evasive maneuvers. Its a scene that wouldnt look out of place in one of Greengrass ""Bourne"" pics suggesting how much the directors immersive handheld aesthetic has been sharpened by his season in the Hollywood tentpole trade. Where Greengrass earlier true-life tales were principally group studies his latest is very much a tale of two captains -- Phillips on the one hand and the pirate leader Muse (Abdi) on the other. Though he himself is but a low-ranking functionary in a vast piracy hierarchy Muse is head honcho on the Alabama and Abdi (a Somali-born American emigre making his film debut) plays the role with the hungry intensity of an oppressed man taking his turn at being the oppressor. In a movie that affords little dimensionality to its characters Abdi finds notes to play you scarcely realized were there until this reedy young man with jutting brow looms as large as Othello. Hanks is predictably sturdy as the embattled captain (save for a come-and-go Boston accent) playing the kind of Everyman facing extraordinary circumstances hes played many times. He never quite disappears into the role in part because there isnt all that much there to disappear into and in part because Hanks has a bag of actorly tics and indications that follow him almost everywhere he goes. But he seems confident handling the tools of the nautical trade and his scenes opposite Abdi bristle with a quiet electricity. Much of the movies first half is devoted to Phillips stealth efforts to keep the pirates away from his crew (who huddle in hiding down in the engine room) feigning mechanical failure and offering to send the marauders on their way with 30000 in cash from an onboard safe (except they want millions). At every step Hanks excels at showing whats really going on in the characters mind while maintaining his facade of almost folksy calm. It isnt one of the actors rangiest roles but it culminates in an eruption of emotional fireworks of exactly the sort Oscar dreams are made of. Like in life ""Captain Phillips"" makes a sharp turn at almost the exact midpoint as the pirates flee the ship in an enclosed lifeboat with Phillips as their hostage. In turn Greengrass and cinematographer Barry Ackroyd (""United 93"") collapse the visual space of the film from the relative expansiveness of the Alabama to a crucible of claustrophobic tension.  As Phillips and the pirates head towards Somalia -- and their fated rendezvous with a U.S. Naval destroyer -- you can almost smell the sweat and grime hanging in the air of the poorly ventilated 28-foot capsule. No one in movies today with the possible exceptions of Kathryn Bigelow and Ken Loach does you-are-there realism better than Greengrass further enhanced by the crackerjack editing of longtime collaborator Christopher Rouse (who also earns a co-producer credit here). Yet ""Captain Phillips"" suffers from a certain vague feeling that weve seen this movie before both in Greengrass own filmography and more explicitly in the excellent recent import ""A Hijacking"" which dramatized a nearly identical case of a Somali pirate attack on a Danish cargo vessel albeit with even less of a happy ending. There director Tobias Lindholm built up a fierce emotional tension by inserting scenes of not just the crews families back home but also the mercenary tactics of the shipping company itself weighing the value of human lives against the corporate bottom line. Here there is something too dry and austere about Greengrass and Rays telescoped vision which touches only fleetingly on the pirates motives the suffering of the Somali people and the collateral damage of global capitalism.

Jesse Smith says September 25 2013 at 217 am As a shipmaster who regularly transits the Gulf of Aden piracy zone (as shown in the movie) I was astonished at the realism shown so far seen in trailer. It really is just alike that - believe me. This area is a hotbed of militancy - as shown by the recent attacks in Nairobi and the endless conflict in Somalia. For further background on this whole issue suggest you read The Megiddo Revenge (http//tinyurl.com/nkn3pz8) which might provide more insight. Reply Mindy Rodriguez says September 22 2013 at 209 pm Boycott Captain Williams Tom Hanks did not listen to one person who had been studing what is happening to our government. Instead Hanks prepared his personal speech for obama. The only way to get hollywood people to listen to us is to withhold funds from them. Do not attend Captain Williams. Reply aaron lawrence says September 29 2013 at 1000 am Yeah boycott captain williams and see captain phillips instead. Dumb troll Reply Kathryn Balter says September 17 2013 at 635 am I thought this movie was wonderful and I had no trouble connecting emotionally to the story. Also there is a typo in your article - they are offered 30000 not 300000. Ted - The USS Bainbrudge features prominently in the film so no worries there. Reply Justin Chang says September 28 2013 at 721 am Thank you for the correction Kathryn. That has been fixed. Reply Liz says September 8 2013 at 515 am A good review overall but let me get this straight. Youre upset with the movie because its not political enough? Give me a break. Greengrass was trying to tell an exciting survival story as it happened. Why should he have to editorialize on ""the collateral damage of global capitalism"" to do that? Meanwhile the other reviews I read said that there was too much politics in the film. Some people just cant win can they? As I recall other than ""Green Zone"" Greengrass makes it a point to keep politics out of his movies. Even ""United 93"" (the best movie about 9/11 as many have said) didnt mention oil Al Qaeda or Western imperialism. It showed the hijackers praying at the very beginning and that was it. I admire Mr. Greengrass for his respect for his audience. ""Green Zone"" failed probably because he diverted from his usual modus operandi. Im glad hes returned to it in ""Captain Phillips"". Reply ted says September 6 2013 at 323 pm All of the videos and photos of this movie do not depict the USS Bainbridge who was the destroyer that actually came to the rescue. I saw a destroyer with a 101 on it which is NOT the Bainbridge. Sorry but I just got done serving on her and it is an important part of her history Reply Colin Biggs says September 6 2013 at 1026 am People suffer all over the world without resorting to kidnapping and murdering others. No sympathy for pirates. Reply Frederick Louis Richardson says September 6 2013 at 422 am A movie dry and austere (Tom Hanks come-and-go accent [?Boston] taking you out of the movie) seems more than apparent in the trailer; the amateurism of Barkhad Abdi awkward and unsure. The whole enterprise appears somewhat misguided based on that trailer and this film review. Absent any other allure than ""piracy"" one imagines VOD/same day in theaters. Reply Bill says September 6 2013 at 319 am Why thank you for your unwarranted snide political commentary (""the collateral damage of global capitalism"") without ever stating that piracy and kidnapping are never warranted no matter how righteous you believe the cause to be. Sorry. We deserve better from Variety than something that could be spewed by MSNBC. Reply Liz says September 8 2013 at 518 am Exactly. Thank you. More than a little self-righteous Id say. Reply Rafael Sanchez says September 6 2013 at 622 pm Well said. Reply Zach says September 23 2013 at 845 pm Im sorry who is being self righteous here? Do you live in Somalia or know first hand what people there experience? Im not condoning the actions that these people took but to sit there in front of your laptop with your first world perspective and write their actions off so easily with a holier than thou attitude is pretty myopic.

Plans for a feature-length adaptation were inevitable as soon as Phillips was rescued. After four days U.S. officials recovered the captain detained the head kidnapper and killed the other three men. The tense ordeal which largely took place within the confines of a lifeboat left little room for embellishment; it was inevitable that director Paul Greengrass known for turning real life catastrophes into tensely realistic nail-biters with ""United 93"" and ""Bloody Sunday"" would be drawn to the project. Its no surprise then that ""Captain Phillips"" Greengrass characteristically fast-paced and true-to-life treatment of the story with Tom Hanks in the title role capably realizes the scenario as it played out in the public imagination. Yet even while proficiently made the movie fails to go beyond the call of duty mainly fueling the same cocktail chatter the events have already inspired. With the exception of his two first-rate entries in the ""Bourne Identity"" franchise Greengrass tends to infuse his movies with a political energy on par with their breathless pace. ""Captain Phillips"" holds similar DNA to ""United 93"" in that it focuses as much on the internal debate among the kidnappers as it does the victims while moving along so swiftly that its interpretative aspects can only be viewed in hindsight. The perfunctory exposition in ""Captain Phillips"" finds confident blue collar worker Phillips heading to the airport for a routine shipping gig with his wife (Catherine Keener in a random cameo oddly billed as a top role) and inadvertently establishing the commitment to the job that will soon come into play ""Things are changing so much"" he says of his profession worrying about the prospects for his children. ""You gotta be strong to survive."" (Hanks evidently working hard to nail Phillips heavy New England accent actually says something like ""You gotta be stwong to soo-vive."")  Phillips capacity to survive the ensuing drama puts that assertion to the test but it also feeds into a larger morally ambiguous examination of American resolve the militant strength that swarms in to protect Phillips turns his third world captors into helpless ants and their inferiority only makes them fight harder. Before it gets that heavy  -- and somewhat heavy-handed -- ""Captain Phillips"" moves along with the enticing ingredients of a traditional thriller. A fleeting scene on the Somali coast establishes the ostensible villains Heeding the orders of their menacing warlords a gang of kidnappers assemble their team for yet another ransom-gathering mission. Headed by the assertive Muse (Barkhad Abdi) and his second-and-command the steely-eyed Najee (Faysal Ahmed) the group also includes navigator Elmi (Mahat M. Ali) and soft-spoken teenager Bilal (Barkhad Adirahman). ""Captain Phillips"" hardly leaves room to develop these characters beyond a few perfunctory conversations but theyre given sufficient dimensionality over the course of the hijacking to hint at the desperation fueling their antics and gradually deconstruct their quasi-racist depiction as one-note antagonists. But first aboard the hulking MV Maersk Alabama ""Captain Phillips"" stays with the perspective of its hardworking seamen. Greengrass capacity to capture the details of routine allow the movie to settle into a natural rhythm before it gets breached; as Phillips speaks with his co-workers taking into account humdrum details for their voyage the casual nature of his exchanges wouldnt be out of place in a National Geographic special. The screenplay by Billy Ray takes as its basis Philips book ""A Captains Duty Somai Pirates Navy SEALS and Dangerous Days at Sea"" and firmly establishes Phillips confidence in his job as a result. But that level of calm is short-lived. The breakneck sequence during which the terrorist pursue and board the cargo ship effectively kicks ""Captain Phillips"" into high gear and Hanks performance follows suit. His calculated responses to the pirates demands as his eyes dart back and forth set aside questions associated with the questionable accent and foreground his speedy calculations. Matched by newcomer Abdi who possesses a cunning instinct to match Phillips trained calm Hanks takes on the role of negotiator before the real negotiators arrive carefully playing along with the kidnappers agenda while coordinating with his men to fight back. The friction between the two men creates a terrifically thick power play that grows exponentially dramatic when the pirates force Phillips into a lifeboat and face down a cavalcade of U.S. authorities. Greengrass finds an intriguing contrast between the entire showdown and the almost casual workplace frustrations of everyone involved. ""Theyre not paying me enough to fight pirates"" argues a union man onboard the ship. That sentiment is echoed by a pirate later on when Phillips tries to reason with them to take the small amount of cash onboard (instead of demanding millions more) and flee. ""I have bosses"" he sighs. ""They have rules."" By then you dont have to know every aspect of the real life events to recognize that the kidnappers are doomed to fail. During the movies final third entirely set onboard the lifeboat with occasional cutaways to the Navy boat nearby they face a formidable show of force. From constant tactical chatter to casting choices that include non-professionals playing fictionalized versions of themselves Greengrass emphasis on authenticity is undeniably effective and all the more impressive in the context of a studio film. For that same reason its acutely subversive Greengrass shifts the plot into an institutional critique less concerned with the possibility of Phillips danger than the obvious lack of resources that doomed the pirates from the outset. ""This game isnt for the weak"" Muse tells the youngest of his group implying the kamikaze nature of their mission. Greengrass provides just enough sociopolitical depth to foreground the movies ideas without deepening them. Aside from Muse the pirates lack enough complexity to make us care about them. The Americans tasked with negotiating from the other side have even less personality as their radio banter takes on a mechanical efficiency that may serve the ideas in flux but has a deadening effect on their emotional value. Theres something to be said about the way ""Captain Phillips"" finds men swept up in a drama that dwarfs them with bureaucratic systems but whenever they discuss that issue the script veers into on-the-nose territory. When Phillips suggests that Muse must have other job possibilities than fisherman and kidnapper Muse bluntly replies ""Maybe in America."" You can practically feel the breeze from Greengrass waving his finger at the audience. Its hard to imagine ""Captain Phillips"" in the hands of any other filmmaker -- and ""Captain Phillips"" in the hands of Greengrass looks exactly like anyone familiar with his work would expect. It does justice to the material even while playing too conscientiously by the book. For better or worse Greengrass virtuous approach is a thinkpiece on imperialism thats been smuggled into commercial escapism. ""I know how to handle America"" the head kidnapper asserts. The outcome it seems suggests that America feels the same way about him. Criticwire grade B HOW WILL IT PLAY? Sony plans to release ""Captain Phillips"" in October 11 following its premiere as the opening night of the New York Film Festival. Conversation about the film and Hanks star power should help the movie toward respectable returns though the heaviness of the story may deter some moviegoers. It should manage some decent awards season play for Hanks performance and the screenplay.
