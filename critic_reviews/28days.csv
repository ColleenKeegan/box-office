A sort of ""Lost Weekend Lite"" ""28 Days"" plays like a ""Rehab Is Good for You"" promo feature offering the audacious suggestion that its preferable to live life with a clear head than with addictions and hangovers. Watching the ever-likable Sandra Bullock ride a predictable roller coaster from substance-abusing party girl to scornful rehab cynic to sober reformed citizen gives this smoothly made picture whatever appeal it possesses but its a superficial no-rough-edges account of a process thats got to be a lot tougher than the month-in-the-country picnic depicted herein. Sony will have to depend upon good response from Bullocks reliable femme-heavy fan base to reach the stars customarily solid midrange grosses with this schematically conceived star vehicle. After hitting the bulls-eye with ""Erin Brockovich"" screenwriter Susannah Grant shows shes still got a few things to learn about developing subplots and bringing supporting characters to life. In form and content this familiar-feeling drama is no different from what easily could have been a telepic starring Cheryl Ladd or Jaclyn Smith a few years ago. Setup -- a hip young woman slipping past the realm of self-control without realizing it -- is rife with possibilities but pic doesnt begin to fulfill them taking the dramatic road of nonconfrontation even as its heroine goes around wearing a sign that reads ""Confront me if I dont ask for help."" Filmmakers could have used a little assistance themselves. Live-for-tonight Greenwich Village scenester Gwen Cummings (Bullock) hits bottom when under the influence of booze and pills she ruins the formal wedding of her sister Lily (Elizabeth Perkins playing stern and wounded) finally commandeering the honeymoon limo and crashing it into a house. Faced with jail or rehab she takes the latter albeit with a determination to avoid its rules and rituals to the fullest extent possible. Easy laughs and viewer identification with Gwen are milked during her indoctrination at Serenity Glen a rural enclave where all the chanting hugging hand-holding soul-baring and singing of dippy songs naturally looks ridiculous from an outsiders p.o.v. Stuck with a teenage drug addict Andrea (Azura Skye) as a roommate Gwen chafes at some of the rules (no cell phones or caffeine) sits sullenly during group sessions gets wasted with her dissolute but charming British b.f. Jasper (a persuasive Dominic West) when he comes to visit armed with contraband goodies (and remarks with mock disappointment ""Where are all the celebrities?"") and generally adopts a holier-than-thou attitude toward her fellow addicts who are at varying stages of recovery. Recognizing her denial game in a second is top counselor Cornell (Steve Buscemi) who not only has seen thousands like Gwen come and go but has been through the mill himself. Given pause by his threat to send her to jail if she doesnt shape up Gwen begins to see the light when she injures herself climbing down a tree from her second-story window in pursuit of some pills she earlier threw to the ground. Fueled by a new determination as well as by some flashback memories of her abusive alcoholic mother who died when she was a girl Gwen finally gets with the program and succeeds to the extent that she is able to refuse the champagne Jasper proffers on his next visit. Gwens progress from this point forward is essentially preordained and dull. A major problem is the lack of distinction developed in the numerous supporting characters. Unlike a classic such as ""One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest"" or even the recent so-so ""Girl Interrupted"" both of which featured numerous inmate characters who made quick impressions and subsequently achieved some depth ""28 Days"" is remarkable for how one-dimensional almost everyone but the lead remains. The casting of Buscemi as the no-nonsense rehab supervisor at first seems like an inspired stroke given the baggage of excess and weirdness the actor carries from previous roles. But the part never emerges as an important one giving him no chance to color it in a personal way. Despite some strong dramatic opportunities Skyes Andrea remains a cliche of teen angst and insecurity while such capable character actors as Reni Santoni Marianne Jean-Baptiste and Michael OMalley arent able to take their roles beyond the single defining characteristics assigned by the script. In the comic relief part of an exotic dancer dealing with coke addiction Alan Tudyk delivers a turn that resembles nothing so much as a parody of a mincing German sissy that Peter Sellers might have done 35 years ago. A bit more substantial in the end is Viggo Mortensen appealingly underplaying the plausible part of a star baseball pitcher accustomed to boundless adoration and sexual opportunity whos got to do time in rehab before returning to the game. He and Gwen form a kind of rocky rapport that fortunately does not follow a path toward sappy mutually restorative romance but does give Gwen a clearer perspective on the decisions shell have to make once she returns to real life. A very silly final scene however squashes whatever meager seriousness the film has generated in the home stretch. Bullock is required to hit more varied notes here than usual and she shifts gears with apparent ease. All the same the script never asks her to go deep and director Betty Thomas herself changing pace after a series of hit comedies demonstrates a constant desire to please rather than to push the material into the rough and dangerous waters that would have made it bracing illuminating and worth ones time. The film is reticent even on the nature of Gwens livelihood; production notes state that the lead character is ""a successful New York writer"" but the finished film offers only one passing reference to Gwens profession with no detail as to whether shes good at it published blocked into fiction or journalism. It also would have helped if the character had been written as being a little smarter in addition to simply feeling superior; this could have improved the quality of her sarcastic remarks and provided more interesting reflections upon the changes she undergoes. Production values are excellent from the good Gotham and North Carolina locations Marcia Hinds-Johnsons lifestyle-evocative production design Declan Quinns luminous lensing and Peter Teschners snappy editing to the lively mixture of Richard Gibbs score and adroit selection of tunes. 28 DaysProductionA Sony Pictures Entertainment release of a Columbia Pictures presentation of a Tall Trees production.

"28 Days Your Lifes a Soggy Mess? Well Thanks for Sharing April 14 2000 FILM REVIEW 28 Days Your Lifes a Soggy Mess? Well Thanks for Sharing Related Articles Current Film Video Selected Scenes and Trailer From the Film 28 Days Forum Join a Discussion on Current Film By STEPHEN HOLDEN he movie ""28 Days"" begins with such a flurry of promise that it comes as a sharp disappointment when this drug-rehab comedy skids out of control and begins to weave around as unsteadily as its central character does in the movies opening scenes. Until that moment about 40 minutes into the picture the film follows its fast-living heroine Gwen Cummings (Sandra Bullock) on a lurching pre-rehab joy ride that scarily evokes her life of reckless self-endangerment. When we first meet Gwen a New York writer (of what sort were never told) and downtown party girl she and her English boyfriend Jasper (Dominic West) nearly set an apartment on fire after a tipsy drug-enhanced night of carousing. Waking up the next morning Gwen realizes she is late for the suburban wedding of her older sister Lily (Elizabeth Perkins) and makes a mad dash for the train. When she arrives her tardiness (and her flagrantly unconvincing excuses) infuriate Lily. The celebration turns into a fiasco when Gwen accidentally lands on her back in her sisters wedding cake. Determined to repair the damage she dashes out of the reception commandeers a limousine and frantically tries to locate a bakery on the car phone. The joy ride ends with a bang as Gwen loses control of the vehicle and crashes into a suburban house. From here the movie jumps ahead to Gwens arrival at Serenity Glen a drug-rehabilitation center she has been ordered by the court to attend to avoid going to jail for driving under the influence. Deprived of her self-medication (shes addicted to Vicodin as well as being a heavy drinker) she behaves like a cranky spoiled brat. Ms. Bullock a star who tries harder than most to be a likable everywoman doesnt shrink from portraying her characters nasty imperious side and these scenes feature some of the most focused screen acting of her career. Shes especially mean to her counselor Cornell whom Steve Buscemi imbues with the deliberate clarified toughness of a man who has only recently clawed his way back from hell. But once Gwen settles into her new life the movie directed by Betty Thomas (""Dr. Dolittle"" ""Private Parts"") from a screenplay by Susannah Grant (""Erin Brockovich"") crumbles into a choppy sequence of seriocomic bits that lurch between sitcom-y silliness and soap-operatic schmaltz without staying long enough in either place to send a clear emotional signal. At its worst the movie often appears to be mocking Serenity Glens self-help rituals which include lots of group cheerleading and confrontations with farm animals. Like a one-man Greek chorus the folk singer Loudon Wainwright III wanders around the place singing his funny-sad songs about the drinking life. But he isnt integrated into the movie. Gwens group-therapy sessions are so rushed that the characters raw emotions fail to register. Most of what is said sounds like second- and third-hand psychobabble and is delivered with an edge of parody that further undermines its weight. And with a couple of exceptions Gwens fellow residents at Serenity Glen are outlandish unfunny caricatures. The weirdest is a gay German dancer named Gerhardt (Alan Tudyk) who wears bottle-thick glasses and moves and talks with the stiffness of a wind-up toy soldier. The saddest is Gwens roommate Andrea (Azura Skye) a 17-year-old recovering heroin addict and rehab veteran with a compulsion to cut herself. Because the movie cant find a common emotional thread to reconcile a clown like Gerhardt with a walking tragedy like Andrea were kept off balance. The one comic element that works is a ludicrously incestuous television soap opera called ""Santa Cruz"" that obsesses Serenity Glens residents. The snippets the movie presents of this suds-drenched travesty offer a hilarious dead-on spoof of daytime drama at its smarmiest. Sandwiched between the rehab scenes are quick flashbacks to Gwens childhood (Diane Ladd is her alcoholic fun-loving mother) that provide an explanatory family dynamic. Of course theres also a rehab romance. The moment Gwen meets Eddie (Viggo Mortensen) a hunky professional baseball player from Oklahoma sparks fly. But just as they start playing footsie the Mephistophelean Jasper appears waving a tempting bottle of Champagne. How scatterbrained is ""28 Days""? Consider that when its time for Gwen to leave Serenity Glen most of the same people she met when she arrived are still around to say goodbye. In the real world their 28 days would have been used up before hers. But then life in Serenity Glen bears only a passing resemblance to grown-up reality at a rehab or anywhere else. Drying out is not the same thing as going back to kindergarten. PRODUCTION NOTES ""28 Days"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has strong language and a scene of self-mutilation.

""28 Days"" tries hard to be funny. Occasionally it is. But mostly it seems forced pat and didactic. Bullock may never escape the girl-next-door image she exudes. She tries in ""28 Days"" with intense dramatic moments that require emotional depth in her starring role as Gwen an alcoholic and rather obnoxious person. Bullock is not at her best as a dramatic force but she always lands on her feet as a plucky main attraction. A writer Gwen is on a dizzy treadmill of boozy -- club-hopping and hellish hangovers with her British beau Jasper (Dominic West) a classic co-dependent and caddish Mr. Personality type out for a good time. At her sister Lilys (Elizabeth Perkins) wedding Gwen gets totally bombed steals a limousine drives it in a frightening wobble through a posh suburb and crashes it into a house escaping with only a few scratches. Gwen is slapped with a 28-day court-ordered sentence in a comfy rehab center. Considering the gravity of her offense -- the destruction of the limo and extensive damage to a house -- it seems shes getting off easy. But the emotional challenges begin in rehab. Gwen hankers for drinks and pills like crazy suffers DTs and sees nightmarish flashbacks of her childhood with an alcoholic mother. But she is also given hope by a counselor (Steve Buscemi) who wont play into her denial game. Though Gwen is largely contemptuous of the rehab scene gradually shes able to unpeel her cynicism and bond with her fellow rehab folks each wrestling demons. The ""patients"" (or offenders) are treated as quirky eccentrics. ""28 Days"" written by Susannah Grant (""Erin Brokovich"") tends to present comic figures especially a gay man named Gerhardt (Alan Tudyk) whose soul-searching speeches take the form of weepy hysterics. Hes a tedious movie stereotype of the overly emotional gay man. Other rehab inmates are an angry physician (Reni Santoni) a Southern housewife (Diane Ladd) an African American mom (Marianne Jean Baptiste) who lost custody of her kids a shamed big-league pitcher named Eddie (Viggo Mortensen) who is also a womanizer and a smart aleck named Oliver (Mike OMalley). A teenage heroin addict Andrea (Azura Skye) is Gwens roommate. The film tries to preach about alcoholism while exploiting its consequences as a source of entertainment. One almost feels that the movie itself is partly in denial about its core subject the ruination of lives via booze and drugs. For anybody whos been touched by the bitter realities of these problems ""28 Days"" is likely to feel like 28 hours of misguided Hollywood drivel. Some Bullock fans will wish she werent in the middle of it. Shes annoying through much of the film and only her scrubbed nice-girl appeal keeps her in the game. Things change for her when she begins to see the tragic pitfalls of addiction through her roommate a lost soul whos given surprisingly shallow treatment. Gwen attracts the ballplayer Eddie a vigorous athletic type. Theres a hint of romance but ""28 Days"" wisely doesnt go there. In one of the films most thoughtful sequences Eddie is approached by autograph-seeking kids at a gas station. But the shame of his life is reflected in the eyes of the kids dad eager to get the boys away from a tainted idol. -- Advisory This movie contains partial nudity some strong language. ..

Directed by Danny Boyle from a screenplay by Alex Garland. 108 minutes. Rated R for strong violence and gore language and nudity. Several theaters. Watching ""28 Days Later"" is a bone-chilling experience not unlike immersing a hand into frigid water and keeping it there despite every instinct to the contrary. Its unpleasant stuff told without winks or humor and its so perfectly pitched that you cant take your eyes off it even if this sort of hard-edged horror isnt exactly your cup of Diet Coke. Filmed in gritty video and strangely off-key colors -- the sunlight in a desolate London has a brown sour tinge -- its an artful haunting journey. ""28 Days Later"" focuses on the metaphor of infection. In a brief jolting prelude a group of animal-rights activists invades a dark lab and frees the chimps imprisoned within. What follows is an extremely graphic illustration of the adage ""no good deed goes unpunished"" as it turns out that those chimps were infected with a deadly virus whose primary symptom is a murderous permanent state of rage. Fast-forward 28 days as a courier named Jim (Cillian Murphy pale and corpselike) awakens from a coma and roams the deserted London streets wondering what happened to the world. Soon hes teamed up with fellow survivors Selena (Naomie Harris) Mark (Noah Huntley) and father/daughter duo Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and Hannah (Megan Burns so good in Stephen Frears ""Liam""). Many of the infected are already dead; the others stagger around the city like wild-eyed zombies searching for a target for their rage. And just when ""28 Days Later"" teeters on the edge of becoming just another zombie movie the focus shifts. A group of soldiers enters the mix and the survivors must face something even more terrifying than monsters men. Director Danny Boyle (""Trainspotting"" ""The Beach"") keeps the dark despairing tone rock-solid throughout and finds tiny moments of humanity. Selena a tough-talking realist (""Staying alives as good as it gets"" she says) at one point grabs Jim for a sudden passionless kiss; its as if she desperately needed to touch somebody. With the SARS epidemic contained (or maybe not) theres something either uncannily timely or tasteless about this films release. No matter; its apocalyptic message is loud and clear -- and grimly memorable.

The 12-stepping of America is now such a noisy public process that those whove never been within 50 miles of a rehab center may feel as if they can anticipate everything that happens to Sandra Bullock in 28 Days an alcoholic-recovery drama Im tempted to describe as disarmingly...well spirited. Bullock plays Gwen Cummings a high-flying New York party girl who crashes to earth after one too many binges. At the beginning we see Gwen in full degraded celebration mode guzzling a few wake-up brewskies and showing up late for her sisters wedding where she does a giggly body slosh across the dance floor finally tipping over backward right onto the wedding cake. ""Dont worry"" blurts out Gwen. ""Ill replace it"" Astoundingly she doesnt even realize that shes out of control. By the time she is done inflicting her damage she has driven a limo into someones house and she is then ordered in lieu of jail time to spend four weeks at Serenity Glen a sprawling woodland detox-and-rehabilitation compound where the motto is ""Mind Body Spirit."" At first the place looks like a touchy-feely New Age horror. The patients gather in groups arms clasped as they engage in earnest sing-alongs of ""Lean on Me"" or yell out cheerleader slogans like ""Together Together Nooooo drugs"" Cleverly the movie invites us to snicker at these soft-soap communal hugs; were taking them in through Gwens eyes -- through the righteous skeptical armor of her denial. Even without booze to light her up shes a firecracker exploding in defiance at a world that refuses to live up to her wishes. Bullock vivacious as she is has always had a spikiness to her a dash of feisty annoyance but that quality has just made her seem a petulant pixie in bad movies like Speed 2 and Forces of Nature. She needs a conflict worthy of her high dander and 28 Days written by Susannah Grant (Erin Brockovich) and directed by Betty Thomas (Private Parts) provides it. At Serenity Glen Gwen is forced to conform to be friendly to stop short-circuiting people with her nanosecond attention span. She spars with the clinics tough-love counselor (Steve Buscemi) who knows how to decipher each addicts unique con artistry and gradually after a misbegotten escape attempt she adapts to the rituals the mop-and-bucket work detail; the daily viewing of Santa Cruz a soap opera in which the characters drama-queen lives are like a purple parody of the ones in rehab. In group therapy Gwen locks horns with such fellow lost souls as the kvetchy self-hating Daniel (Reni Santoni) the no-nonsense Roshanda (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) and a cuddly gay German nerd named Gerhardt played with discombobulated panache by Alan Tudyk. Gwen is such a pill that they all gang up on her until she warns them to ""back the f-- off"" Suddenly as if part of a conspiracy everyone breaks into applause for her ""good work."" Its a funny bracing moment. As 28 Days reveals the goopy recovery-speak with its hint of cultishness may be stilted and dehumanizing but thats part of why its effective. Its there to break down the addicts most precious and destructive weapon -- her renegade selfishness her pride. The movie could have used a few more of those moments. Nothing that happens in 28 Days rings false exactly but too much of Gwens recovery is generalized in a pat instructional case-study sort of way. Her roommate (Azura Skye) a morose 17-year-old heroin addict is one of those cautionary characters who might as well have ""Doom Generation"" tattooed on her forehead and Gwens private turmoil is revealed almost entirely through childhood flashbacks to her sozzled good-time-floozy mom. After a while Gwen develops a flirtation with a rehabbing baseball star (Viggo Mortensen) whos a clean-cut sweet-talkin dreamboat. Hes the films all too convenient way of letting her ease herself out of her relationship with her boozer boyfriend -- played with piercing jadedness by Dominic West. Bullock gives it her all; shes bristling and alive on screen in a way that she hasnt been since Speed. Whats missing from her acting is whats missing from the movie namely a deeper more probingly confessional sense of Gwens demons -- of what precisely the escape of alcohol has meant to her. When Michael Keaton played a cocaine-and-booze hound in the similarly structured Clean and Sober (1988) you felt that you knew every neuron of his twitchy cross-wired defense system. In 28 Days there is plenty of squalid bad behavior most of it depicted with engrossing honesty but we dont get close enough to the inner trauma from which it emerges. Its as if the movie itself had already been through rehab.
