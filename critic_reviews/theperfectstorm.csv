More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Reilly; Director Wolfgang Petersen; Author Sebastian Junger William B. Wittliff; Producer (group) Baltimore Spring Creek Productions; Release Date Wide 06/30/2000; Runtime (in minutes) 129; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted July 14 2000 -- 1200 AM EDT In one of the many tersely haunting passages of his sea-disaster chronicle The Perfect Storm Sebastian Junger describes the ominous siren song made by the wind during an apocalyptic ocean deluge ""Force 10 is a shriek. Force 11 is a moan. Over Force 11 is something fishermen dont want to hear...a deep tonal vibration like a church organ."" I wouldnt expect or even want a Hollywood adaptation of a bestseller to scrupulously reproduce every detail of the book. Yet I went into Wolfgang Petersens 140 million version of The Perfect Storm hoping to hear at least once that otherworldly church-organ threnody. Instead I was confronted with a different sound a goopy inspirational musical score by James Horner (Titanic) that might have been composed for Ronald Reagans autobiography. More than just overkill that soundtrack tells us that the men aboard the Andrea Gail a Gloucester Mass. swordfishing boat that gets trapped in one of the most violent noreasters of the 20th century are having the rah-rah adventure of their lives. Look theres Billy Tyne (George Clooney) the captain and his scrappy crew waterlogged yet unbowed driven to topsy-turvy extremes by one massive breaking wave after another yelling at each other with gusto through the blackened hurricane night. The film presents their ordeal as a noble crusade of brute physical exertion. But thats not what Sebastian Junger wrote about. He wrote about fear and awe and the deathly strangeness of primal nature a phenomenon that few whove witnessed it have lived to describe. There isnt much to the characters in The Perfect Storm but then there wasnt much in the book either. Tyne and his mates like the gruff romantic Bobby Shatford (Mark Wahlberg) and the embattled prematurely old salts Murphy (John C. Reilly) and Sully (William Fichtner) are saddened New England roughnecks who are struggling to stay afloat economically. Theyve got a hold full of fish and a broken ice machine; unless they agree to crash through two raging storms risking their lives their catch is going to spoil. With nuts-and-bolts vigor the movie lays out the blue-collar-Hemingway experience of these contemporary fishermen the faceoffs with wriggling swordfish the hooks that can rip into your hand and pull you right under. Then the turbulence hits -- and oddly enough its the movie that capsizes. Petersen gives us monumental images of waves and rain and wind but the editing is so choppy that the images dont build and crest. There isnt a potent enough sense of the Andrea Gails slow submersion in an inexorable meteorological monster. For all of its computer-enhanced technical dexterity The Perfect Storm looks and feels like too many other movies in which ships struggle to stay afloat as the mad seas thrash around them. Near the end there is one grandly looming nearly vertical wave which picks up the boat as if it were a bathtub toy. Its a beautiful moment of self-contained terror yet it never quite convinces you that the storm youve been watching is alive.

"Instant Calamity (Just Add Water) June 30 2000 FILM REVIEW Instant Calamity (Just Add Water) By STEPHEN HOLDEN Related Articles  Current Film Video  Trailer From the Film The Perfect Storm ADD YOUR THOUGHTS Discuss ""The Perfect Storm"" and see what other readers are saying in Abuzz. o put it bluntly ""The Perfect Storm"" is no ""Titanic."" This gusty oceanic epic directed by Wolfgang Petersen (""Air Force One"" ""Das Boot"") from Sebastian Jungers best-selling book has lollapalooza special effects and gripping ensemble performances. But its quotient of human drama is finally too stingy for the personal stories of a group of New England fisherman battling ""the storm of the century"" to hit the emotional bulls-eye. When in its final scenes the movie desperately tries to churn up some of the celestial schmaltz of ""Titanic"" it is too little too late and feels obligatory despite the abundance of heart and chemistry that Mark Wahlberg and Diane Lane bring to their roles of a wildly-in-love young couple. The films central character (like the books) isnt a person but an actual storm that blew up the New England coast on Halloween in 1991. But as much as we try to humanize meteorological disasters by naming hurricanes and deciphering their personalities through their histories storms ultimately dont have feelings or even intentions. Or at least this one doesnt in its movie incarnation. The Weather Channel does a better more thorough and soberer job of personalizing garden-variety hurricanes than does ""The Perfect Storm"" which relies on reiterated hyperbole to convey the force of its monster while withholding the kind of detailed meteorological information that might have generated more suspense. Hollywood for all its wondrous special effects has never been able to get a firm grip on the weather. As impressive as some of its special effects may be ""The Perfect Storm"" (like ""Twister"" before it) fails to convey the weathers changing moods and the ominously majestic march of events that signal inclement weather. The story follows the fateful voyage of a swordfishing boat the Andrea Gail into the North Atlantic as three storms collide offshore and combine to ignite a meteorological explosion. Once the movie leaves the shore a story that began as a richly hued mosaic of life in a New England fishing town (Gloucester Mass.) quickly succumbs to its own technological wizardry and becomes waterlogged. ""The Perfect Storm"" is so eager for its big waves to arrive as soon as possible that it shoehorns in what feels like an extraneous subplot lifted from the book about the rescue of another vessel and the crash of a Coast Guard helicopter. Although these sequences are meant to prepare us for the storm that has yet to overtake the Andrea Gail they are little more than distracting adventure filler whose characters arent even introduced and therefore they mean nothing. Anonymity is also a big problem in the movies middle and later portions a nearly continuous din of wind and water in which the boats crew members all but disappear under their slickers while desperately trying to keep their vessel afloat. Every so often the movie hurriedly flashes to shore where the crews loved ones huddle around their television sets waiting for news. But the film is so impatient to return to its special effects that these scenes have little resonance. As the movie repeats the images of wind and waves over and over it begins to dawn that the storm in progress is simply too large an event for the movie to take in. Drowned out by the simulated roar of nature (reinforced by James Horners mediocre obtrusively pounding score) much of the shipboard dialogue is unintelligible. Even when daring individual rescues are carried out its difficult to tell whos saving whom. The endless visual whoosh also makes it hard to keep up with the emergency navigational procedures that prevent the boat from breaking apart. And when we dont know quite whats happening the crews hard-won victories seem hollow. After a while the unending tumult simply becomes monotonous. Although a few tilting shots suggest a boat pitching in the waves the camera remains level throughout most of the storm so you rarely have a sense of being tossed about on the ocean. In other words a dose of Dramamine before the movie is not necessary. In denying us any sense of stomach-churning chaos the movie keeps the violence at such a far remove that it rarely feels especially scary. The money shots are parceled out as carefully (and as parsimoniously) as the movies personal dramas. The most awesome (familiar from the movies ubiquitous trailer) comes very late and portrays the boats head-first climb into a looming 90-foot mountain of water. It is the one stunner in a movie that could have done with two or three more knockout visuals. In the end ""The Perfect Storm"" feels like two movies grafted together. The first third is a glowing portrait of Gloucester and the salty roughneck flavor of its fishing industry. In a series of short but pungent scenes we meet its fishermen and are introduced to the risky competitive low-paying enterprise of swordfish harvesting. The movies vision of this life is unabashedly romantic but convincing thanks largely to Bill Wittliffs economical screenplay which keeps its ear attuned to the Yankee dialect. When a fleet arrives back at port the women ecstatically pour out of their homes to greet their men on the docks and the town begins to pulse. The sight of tipsy couples in a waterfront bar joyously swaying in each others arms to the lusty strains of Bruce Springsteens ""Hungry Heart"" produces a pang of longing to embrace this elemental livelihood and the working-class solidarity that goes with it. The movies Romeo and Juliet Bobby Shatford (Mr. Wahlberg) a divorced financially troubled fisherman and his adoring fiancee Christina (Ms. Lane) may no longer be teenagers but they exude the radiant passion of high school sweethearts. These lovers give the movie most of its warmth. Although George Clooney has a more substantial role as the boats captain Billy Tyne the character remains an enigma. Mr. Clooney conveys a darkly heroic gravity but his lack of even a trace of a New England accent makes him seem socially out of place in a cast whose other members get the regional dialect more or less right. The movie tentatively teases us with the possibility that Billy who has had a run of disappointing catches will become involved with Linda Greenlaw (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) a fellow fisherman who has her own boat and has had a string of good luck. Had the movie envisaged a ""Moby-Dick""-like struggle between Billy and the superstorm into which he steers the Andrea Gail with a reckless determination ""The Perfect Storm"" might have accrued some heavy allegorical weight. Certainly Mr. Clooneys Billy with his glowering dark-circled eyes ruddy stubbled face and air of impermeable masculinity suggests a man peering challengingly into the eye of fate. But ""The Perfect Storm"" misses its opportunity to evoke a metaphysical struggle and it is much the poorer for it. In its most solemn moments ""Titanic"" plunged us into a panorama of death surrounding us with shipwrecked passengers moaning and crying as they slowly froze in the North Atlantic water. In the one comparable image in ""The Perfect Storm"" the camera slowly pulls from a lone man in the ocean to observe him from afar a speck of life bobbing helplessly on the heaving waves. Its only a glimpse of eternity and not nearly enough to stir up the awe that is missing from the heart of the film. ""The Perfect Storm"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some strong language and sexual situations.

Starringf George Clooney Mark Wahlberg Diane Lane John C. Reilly and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. Directed by Wolfgang Petersen. Written by Bill Wittliff. (PG-13. 130 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""The Perfect Storm"" the Sebastian Junger best-seller about six fishermen battling the biggest storm on record in October 1991 was a ferociously good read. It combined superb research a wealth of meteorological and nautical detail and Jungers expert straightforward storytelling. It seemed like a natural for a big-screen action adventure and a natural as well for Wolfgang Petersen the German director who made the World War II submarine epic ""Das Boot."" Petersen who also made the Harrison Ford thriller ""Air Force One"" is the man for the job all right even if ""The Perfect Storm"" doesnt match the overwhelming white-knuckle terror of Jungers book. Surprisingly the scenes on land that open the film and establish our emotional links with the six Massachusetts fishermen who risk their lives are the most compelling. The extravagant special effects that follow simulating 100-foot waves and 120-mph winds that hit when a hurricane collides with two weather fronts are technically amazing. But they dont quite get under our skin. Screenwriter Bill Wittliff draws us into the world of Gloucester Mass. the centuries-old fishing port where the Andrea Gail a 72-foot swordfishing boat is ready to embark on a monthlong expedition to the Grand Banks. The captain Billy Tyne (George Clooney) had a disappointing haul on his last trip -- hes ""on a cold streak"" -- and decides to go out again two days later even though the October sea is notoriously volatile. Life in Gloucester revolves around the men of the Andrea Gail and the swordfishing industry. Among its residents are anxious wives and kids a greedy boat owner a rival boat captain (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) and a mama bear who runs the Eagle Nest a local bar thats part way station part orphanage for men who bring home bundles of cash and then blow it on weeklong drinking binges. Clooneys crew includes Bobby (Mark Wahlberg) a simple guy with an adoring girlfriend Chris (Diane Lane) who wants him -- at home; a perfectly cast John C. Reilly as Murph a gruff bear with a soft spot for his kid; and William Fichtner Allen Payne and John Hawkes as misfits and loners who hate the sea but love the challenge of swordfishing. The heart of the story is the Bobby-Chris romance Wahlberg has a wonderfully natural screen presence and his scenes with Lane give the audience an emotional hook. If we didnt care so much about this simple guy and his divorced girlfriend then the scenes at sea wouldnt have the tension they do. When the Andrea Gail leaves Gloucester and Lanes tight worried face is superimposed on the left side of the screen it seems hokey -- a piece of outdated Hollywood schmaltz -- but somehow right. Who wouldnt fall in love with Diane Lane? The storm sequences and rescue efforts most of which were shot on a soundstage and enhanced by computer graphics go on too long. Theres one stunt that made me gasp out loud however when Reillys hand gets caught in a huge hook and hes yanked into the deep. Petersens direction John Seales photography and Industrial Light amp; Magics digital effects are impressive. But the work that went into creating the phenomenon of a massive storm seems more like a feat -- a well-engineered construction -- than the real thing. In his book Junger wrote about giant ""rogue waves"" that are so powerful ""they seem to exceed the forces generating them."" ""The Perfect Storm"" does about as good a job of simulating that terror as it possibly could but its no competition for what we create in our minds eye while reading. By attempting a visual equivalent for the catastrophe that Junger described so well in his book the filmmakers remind us that our imaginations ability to conjure these images is inevitably more powerful than a moviemakers efforts to fake them. -- Advisory This film contains rough language and tense situations. ..

Wolfgang Petersen made a classic underwater film with ""Das Boot"" but he doesnt fare nearly as well on the surface with ""The Perfect Storm."" An attempt to do on the high seas what ""Twister"" did on great open spaces on land this adaptation of Sebastian Jungers bestseller about some Gloucester Mass. fishermens battle with the storm of the century boasts a physical enormity courtesy of heavy digital effects work. But the yarns emotional undercurrents never take hold resulting in a picture that leaves one thinking less about the fates of the characters than about how the actors had to spend most of their working days soaking wet. Warner Bros. might be able to propel this to a big opening but ultimate B.O. promises to fall well short of the blockbuster biz needed to recoup the  140 million budget. In setting and substance pic resembles the sort of gritty melodramas about working-class people doing risky jobs that Warners used to crank out so effectively back in the 30s and 40s. And while developments in technology have enabled the contempo production team to create a bigger and more visceral film than would have been possible decades ago the plain truth is that todays digital wonders convey just as artificial a feel as the combination of good studio tank/rear projection/model work did then; no one seeing ""Perfect Storm"" is going to believe that whats onscreen is any less or more ""real"" than kids thought ""The Sea Wolf"" was in 1941. Jungers nonfiction tome was based on the fate of a swordfishing boat the Andrea Gail that ventured far into the Atlantic in search of a big catch in the fall of 1991 and got caught in the convergence of three weather fronts that created a storm of unmatched ferocity. Its an elemental man vs. nature struggle  played out against a backdrop that for obvious reasons has always been difficult to film with absolute credibility and clarity. After beginning with a low-key tribute to the thousands of Gloucester fishermen who have gone down to the sea in ships since the early 1600s pic settles in for a half-hour of elementary scene setting and character exposition at the Crows Nest a dockside dive where everyone goes to get smashed (and laid) after returning from a spell at sea. Theres Andrea Gail captain Billy Tyne (George Clooney) a divorced dad whose lucky streak at finding fish has hit a sand bar and Bobby Shatford (Mark Wahlberg) also divorced whos got a hot thing going with the cutest girl in town Christine Cotter (Diane Lane) herself a divorcee who wants to get her kids back and settle down with Bobby. Also shuffled onboard are Billys other crew members Murph (John C. Reilly) a young salt separated from his wife and adoring young son; Bugsy (John Hawkes) a scrawny dufus who strikes out in his bid for romance even with the largest lady in the bar (an engaging Rusty Schwimmer); and Alfred Pierre (Allen Payne) a Jamaican who in a tiresome piece of racial stereotyping is given no personality dimension other than being a stud spends his entire shore time shagging with such vigor upstairs that it causes the ceiling light fixture in the bar to shake. Hovering on the periphery is Linda Greenlaw (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) a friendly rival fishing captain who wouldnt mind becoming even friendlier with Billy. Even though the inclement fall season is fast approaching Billy decides to set out on one more trip to make up for his most recent disappointing haul and out of sheer financial need his crew signs back on; joining them this time is Sully (William Fichtner) a lout with a hair-trigger temper who develops an instantaneous and thoroughly unmotivated enmity with Murph. The location photography of the town that inspired Kiplings ""Captains Courageous"" and the characters scruffy grooming constant drinking and smoking and heavy preoccupation with earnings establish the working-class milieu solidly enough. But the emotional links and desires along with the motivational notations and behavioral ticks in Bill Wittliffs screenplay are perfunctory and undeveloped as if they were items to be ticked off a checklist. After you get past the joint reason for the new trip (money) and basic domestic situation (divorced or single mostly) no further nuances or subtext are provided as the characters prepare to face an epic struggle for survival thereby significantly shortchanging the emotional impact and audience investment in the outcome. When the crews initial catches prove lackluster Billy decides to push farther out past the treacherous Grand Banks to the remote Flemish Cap where they land enough swordfish to fill their hold. Unfortunately the boats ice-making machine goes on the blink meaning theyll have to race directly home so that the fish wont spoil before getting to market. But staring them in the face is an astonishing tempest created (as helpfully noted by TV weatherman Christopher McDonald) when Hurricane Grace heads north from Bermuda to collide with another storm and a cold front. With his macho survival instinct and sense of professionalism in full working order Billy thinks they can beat the storm and plows right into it but hes unaware of its full magnitude. There are sequences of notable tension before the final onslaught but even here one watches the action with heart and mind unquickened by genuine suspense  due both to the mild involvement in character and the haphazard nature of the incidents and the way in which they are conveyed. Focus on the fate of the Andrea Gail is supplemented by a parallel episode about a yacht bearing three people (Bob Gunton Cherry Jones and Karen Allen) who are the objects of a daring rescue attempt by a Coast Guard ship and an Air Force helicopter in the middle of the hurricane. Although awkwardly intercut with the main story at times interlude commands rapt attention by virtue of the outrageous physical feats undertaken (the chopper at one point tries a nocturnal midair refueling in virtually zero visibility) and generates more feeling for the exceptionally brave anonymous pilots than does the central drama which concludes on a note that can only be called refreshingly somber in the context of todays relentlessly uplifting cinema. With the exception of Reilly who in his full beard looks like a cuddly rat who would be at home on any vessel cast is merely adequate. By the second half the men are reduced to shouting almost all their lines to be heard over the watery din while the dressed-down but ever-fetching Lane leads the group of worrying women on the home front. Industrial Light amp; Magics special effects work is extensive and no doubt state of the art when it comes to the exceedingly difficult task of reproducing water by digital means. But even after one becomes accustomed to the rough weathers computerized look the sense of artifice remains which might account for some of the sense of emotional remove. James Horners churning score never goes away at least in the final hour while other craft work is pro but undistinguished.
