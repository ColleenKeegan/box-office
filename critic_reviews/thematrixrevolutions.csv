But now those same dragons have seven heads A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - --Abbas Kiarostami IN THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS THE DRAGONS -- be they swarming Sentinels or replicating Smiths -- have way more than seven heads and so does the movie. As in The Matrix Reloaded (released this past May) there are moments in which the screen becomes congested by so much computer-generated Sturm und Drang its impossible to discern exactly what it is were seeing -- or at least to make ourselves care about it. And being that The Matrix Revolutions is the final chapter in the visionary (and so far enormously successful) sci-fi trilogy dreamed up by brothers Andy and Larry Wachowski it naturally contains more such moments than any of its predecessors in or out of the Matrix franchise. Originally conceived not so much as a stand-alone part three but as the second half of a single mega-sequel (of which Reloaded was the first half) Revolutions is as one might therefore expect nearly wall-to-wall climax -- an unwieldy two-plus-hours third act of a movie guided by the principle (incubated by Reloaded and fully grown here) that too much is never too much. Long before its over The Matrix Revolutions has given us ample time to ponder the many ways in which the movies in general -- and the Matrix movies in particular -- were that much bolder brighter and scarier when their dragons had fewer heads. Indeed the process of producing these two back-to-back sequels appears to have taken a significant toll on its enigmatic creators. Whereas so much of the charm of The Matrix (1999) rested in its fundamental unselfconsciousness -- its ability to dazzle us (both with regard to its action and its ideas) without seeming to realize it was doing anything out of the ordinary -- Reloaded and Revolutions have been weighed down by the enormous expectations (both self- and audience-imposed) that the Wachowskis would top even the most innovative trickery of their earlier work and that at the final unraveling of their Matrix mythology might lie not merely revolution but revelation. Unfortunately being a modern mythologist is no easy racket Just ask George Lucas. Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm As faithful series viewers will recall The Matrix Reloaded ended on a cliffhanger in which trench-coated uber-hero Neo (Keanu Reeves) having miraculously brought his latex-costumed lover Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) back from the brink of death suddenly discovered that his heretofore only-inside-the-Matrix superpowers now seemed to work in the real world as well. With a single wave of his hand he managed to strike down a pack of Sentinels -- those nasty hydra-headed seek-and-destroy machines that had immolated the good ship Nebuchadnezzar and threatened to make mincemeat of its crew. Not long before which a battalion of ships attempting to fend off the imminent destruction of Zion -- that last outpost of unplugged human life -- had themselves been thwarted by the errant firing of a powerful electromagnetic pulse. Picking up mere hours later The Matrix Revolutions continues its predecessors concern over the fate of Zion now a mere 24 hours away from doom. But before that can be addressed other more urgent matters must be tended to such as the semi-comatose state in which Neos heroics at the end of the last installment left him. Only Neo isnt really out cold. Hes stranded somewhere between the real world and the Matrix in an antiseptic sparsely populated subway station presided over by a toothy bedraggled train conductor (The Road Warriors Bruce Spence). Indeed itll be some time before Revolutions gets around to addressing (let alone answering) other portentous nagging questions from Reloaded e.g. how did Neo do what he did to those Sentinels? And what was that Architect guy really on about anyway? In fact for a brief delectable moment as Neo continues to mull over the Architects suggestion that choice is but another system of control there is the intimation that those questions -- in an ultimate fulfillment of the Wachowskis insatiable appetite for armchair philosophizing -- might never be answered. No such luck. OF COURSE IT WAS LIKELY IMPOSSIBLE that any sequel would recapture The Matrixs sense of mystery the thrilling dislocation we felt as the Wachowskis hurtled us about their meticulously ordered netherworld of glittering skyscrapers and cozy green-Formica kitchens slowly assembling the pieces of their futuristic puzzle forever tugging at the rug beneath our feet. (So thrilling in fact that few of us even bothered to comment on the essential paradox of being able to fend off homicidal computer programs with kung fu techniques.) In a way it was as though at the end of that film Neo had freed not only himself from The Matrix but us as well. Nothing could ever be the same again. Then came the subterranean Zion of Reloaded and Revolutions with its flaming pyres barefoot raves/orgies and tribal-elder councils -- and a sense of having peeled back all The Matrixs layers of illusion and deception only to find Star Trek The Prehistoric Generation underneath. Revolutions is the most Zion-centric Matrix picture to date and it lacks many of the pleasurable distractions -- the colorful supporting characters the ever-shifting topography the oddball sexual humor -- that gave Reloaded despite its problems a propulsive kick. The disappointments of The Matrix Revolutions however extend well beyond that. The film seems to exist primarily to accommodate two elaborate inevitable set pieces -- the clash between the Zion and machine armies and simultaneously the mano-a-mano duel between Neo and Smith (Hugo Weaving) a.k.a. the Super Burly Brawl -- which arrive in a blur of digital gunfire and computer-animated people and machinery as numbing as it is from a technical standpoint impressive. As Neo and Smith duke it out for the last time -- tumbling through the Matrixs stormy virtual-reality skies wholly unbound by the laws of physics -- we dont feel like were soaring alongside them the way we did with Christopher Reeve in the old Superman movies but rather like weve been stranded behind on Earth watching as someone else plays the final level of an incredibly high-tech emotionally uninvolving video game. Just as their films have developed a certain self-consciousness about their own grandiosity -- a foreknowledge (which comes to a head in Revolutions) that they are giving us that they must give us the best most inimitable spectacle Joel Silvers money can buy -- so the Wachowskis seem to have been convinced of the Godlike status that legions of movie geeks have appointed to them. Theyve isolated themselves on a Kubrickian media iceberg refusing interviews and becoming fodder for a series of scandal-mongering tabloid headlines. Theyve even stripped their press-kit biography down to a scant three sentences the last of which reads ""Little else is known about them"" -- a declaration I roundly doubt was included back when the Wachowskis were just the directors of the terrifically wicked lesbian-noir Bound (1996) the screenwriters of the misbegotten Sylvester Stallone vehicle Assassins (1995) or even the creators of the original Matrix which difficult as it may be to believe now was far from a sure bet when it first arrived. Which is also a way of saying that somewhere along the winding road to The Matrix Revolutions the making of these films has come to seem for their makers more work than play. Writing in these pages several months back John Powers suggested that had God himself been responsible for the ""epoch-making world"" of The Matrix He might have opted to rest rather than embarking on these two sequels. Watching The Matrix Revolutions you sense that the Wachowskis should have sooner abided by Gods example or at least by their own films ad line and oft-iterated dictum ""Everything that has a beginning has an end.""

Orange mans 2nd trial nets life term in killing - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Sentence Orange mans 2nd trial nets life term in killingJuly 10 2009|By Sarah Lundy and Amy L. Edwards Sentinel Staff WritersA judge sentenced a 22-year-old Orange County man to life in prison without parole Thursday in a 2006 fatal shooting during a drug deal gone wrong.Deangelo Conner was convicted last month of first-degree murder armed robbery and two counts of robbery with a firearm.Florida law required Circuit Judge Bob Wattles to sentence Conner to life in prison for the murder conviction.Conner had turned down a 25-year plea offer and took his chances at trial.His first trial ended in a mistrial after jurors were heard discussing the case before it was allowed.Authorities say Conner shot Ricardo Rivera 41 once in the chest July 6 2006.Conner and two others initially set up the meeting as a drug buy but they never intended to pay for anything the prosecution said; the three planned to grab the drugs and run.At one point Conner pulled out a gun and fired at Rivera. Conner told investigators that Rivera was charging toward him and he was merely protecting himself.The jury didnt buy it.Several of Ricardo Riveras relatives attended the sentencing including his children and brother Robert Rivera who read statements from several people.In a statement Ricardo Riveras ex-wife wrote that the hardest thing she has had to do was tell her children they no longer had a father.The woman wrote that her familys hurt will never go away.

It is The Matrix Disappoints. 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Matrix Revolutions Science fiction. Starring Keanu Reeves Carrie-Anne Moss Laurence Fishburne Hugo Weaving. Directed and written by Larry and Andy Wachowski. (R. 129 minutes. At Bay Area theaters). In ""The Matrix Revolutions"" the dismal final installment in the phenomenally successful science fiction series humans engage in a fierce battle to save themselves from extinction by machines. If only filmmakers Larry and Andy Wachowski could have saved themselves from their own machines. Their computer-generated imagery goes from dazzling to deadening in action scenes that favor heavy clanking weaponry over the martial-arts moves that thrilled viewers of ""The Matrix"" and ""The Matrix Reloaded."" The computerized excess is especially disheartening because the first two ""Matrixes"" more than any other recent sci-fi films exhibited intense humanism. The war against the machines represented the endurance of free will against oppression. The idea of repercussions for every decision good or bad invested viewers in the choices made by Neo (Keanu Reeves) a computer hacker chosen as the humans savior. We related because he could have been anyone. But in the thinly sketched ""Matrix Revolutions"" as played with grim dullness by Reeves Neos no longer really anyone at all just a vehicle for resolution of the film series. Much of Neos past and his motivation must be assumed or recalled from the previous installments. No one who hasnt seen the first two films has a prayer of understanding ""The Matrix Revolutions."" The relationships between Neo and his fellow human rebels Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) so crucial to the first two films get short shrift. ""Revolutions"" was filmed at the same time as ""Reloaded"" partly in the East Bay. ""Reloaded"" heavy on philosophizing and over-the-top action sequences was too much and this one is too little. They would have been better as a single film. The fear when ""Revolutions"" starts is of too much exposition and not enough action. If only. Neo and his shipmates in the real world try to figure out why hes in limbo between the Matrix (the computer world humans plug into to fight the machines) and the machine world. He finds his way out but the Oracle (Mary Alice replacing the late Gloria Foster) a rare source of warmth in this chilly endeavor has told him that the final battle with the machines is near ""Everything that has a beginning has an end."" Its hard to argue with that. Reeves barely registers an expression when Neo reunites with lover Trinity. The bond established between them in the first movies isnt discernible here. Reeves and Moss share little screen time though their characters great love is cited often as the reason both will risk their lives for humanity. As little emoting as there is its sorely missed once the action takes over. Also Reeves is MIA for much of the picture because Neo has taken a ship to the machine world as the humans try to hold off the machines in Zion the last human city. Reeves reportedly got paid 15 million for the film about 400000 for every minute of screen time. Hugo Weaving provides some lively moments as the droll duplicating Agent Smith whos never too far behind Neo. Weaving expands Smiths satiric repertoire from glib satisfaction to mock curiosity at humans silly ties to emotion. Even better is Ian Bliss as a human crew member whose body has been taken over by Smith. Bliss nails Weavings laconic menace right away but it takes Neo ages to recognize the presence inhabiting his colleague. ""Who are you?"" he asks after about five minutes. Apparently Neo is only really smart in some ways. The battle royale starts awesomely enough with a giant machine boring its way into Zion emitting masses of tentacled overachieving metal creatures to withstand the humans firepower. But by about 15 minutes in the battle sequence has taken on a video-game sameness. Its as if the Wachowskis caught the George Lucas virus and decided that if it could be done with CGI then by golly it should be. In fact some of battle scenes look straight out of ""Attack of the Clones."" Jada Pinkett Smith as the pint-size firebrand piloting a human ship adds some zest to the firefight. Her characters former lover the great Morpheus has been reduced to her co-pilot. Much of the movie involves supporting players we barely recognize and dont care about. Stranded by the Wachowskis stilted dialogue few of these actors make an impact. A couple of the characters might be more recognizable to those who have played the Matrix video game or seen the Wachowskis animated ""The Animatrix."" But movie viewing shouldnt have to be qualified..This film contains violence raw language.

Yet this come-down of a series capper is so arch and pompous amid its clanks and collisions that you can only snicker at the verbal wind that obscures the din of marauding machinery. Keanu Reeves and Hugo Weaving in a scene from the motion picture The Matrix Revolutions. By Jasin Boland Warner Bros. Among its casualties is the benefit of the doubt that a few deluded types (myself included) gave The Matrix Reloaded. Still Mays opening sequel salvo had one of the decades niftier car chases and a restaurant scene rife with human tension unique to the series. About all Revolutions has is better spacing of its action scenes though for intimidating hardware we vote for RoboCop. Like Santa Annas troops at the Alamo or The Blob in any neighborhood Revolutions Machines on the march just wont quit with an expected arrival in Zion the outpost of civilization just 20 hours away. But first Reeves Neo character must extricate himself from real/Machine-world limbo in a sloggy opener. That is followed by a reunion of Reloadeds glam eatery couple (Lambert Wilson Monica Bellucci) that lasts just long enough for him to eat two or three olives and for us to sneak about as many looks down her dress. More about the movie The Matrix Revolutions (1/2 stars out of four) Stars Keanu Reeves Carrie-Anne Moss Laurence Fishburne Jada Pinkett-Smith Director Andy Wachowski Larry Wachowski Distributor Warner Bros. Rating Rated R for sci-fi violence and brief sexual content. Opens worldwide today By the time we get to a new-look Oracle who chain-smokes (Mary Alice replacing the late Gloria Foster) the movie is in trouble Get that woman a nicotine patch. Speaking of trouble should Jada Pinkett Smiths skill at piloting a spaceship compel more than the Neo/Trinity (Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss) love story? When Machine components swirl en masse were reminded of The Swarm and a distracting Reeves eye mishap suggests Lasik gone terribly wrong -- or maybe hes auditioning for Oedipus Rex. Plus we endure continuing blather about ""The One."" Hugo Weavings maverick Agent Smith gets a knowing chuckle with his first appearance but the sneers less dear the third time around. One scene late in the movie will remind almost anyone of Frank Morgans comeuppance as the fabled wizard in The Wizard of Oz an unfortunate smoke-and-mirrors echo for filmmakers Larry and Andy Wachowski who now appear to have pied-pipered our pockets into emptying. Theres another movie coming out next week called The Big Empty but now we know the truth.

Create your own alert to be notified on topics youre interested in. Or visit Popular Alerts for suggestions. Manage alerts | What is this? (CNN) -- When it comes to the ""Matrix"" franchise either people love it -- really really love it. Or they hate it -- really really hate it. With more than a billion dollars in ticket sales worldwide its abundantly clear that an awful lot of people fall into the former category. So without doubt ""The Matrix Revolutions"" will make millions of additional dollars. However in the spirit of full disclosure I fall firmly into the latter category. Before you start sending nasty e-mails -- and believe me Ill get them -- I do think the ""Matrix"" series has been revolutionary in terms of special effects and the use of groundbreaking computer-generated images. The mysterious Wachowski brothers Andy and Larry (who wrote directed and executive-produced all three films) have created the visual gold standard for every action/sci-fi flick that has followed their 1999 original. The action and the images are truly breathtaking. Theyre also repetitive. Just how many times can a giant drill get your attention before it becomes ... well just another giant drill? Moreover none of these three big-screen extravaganzas (with the possible exception of the original) has been an actual movie with character development subplots context or even any content to speak of. Theyre video games. Oh theyre great video games Spectacular video games Perhaps the best video games in the history of human civilization But video games nevertheless. Endless destruction Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) has replicated himself countless times and faces off with Neo in a climactic battle. The first ""Matrix"" was unique and had a certain flair combined with stunning action. But even die-hard fans have to admit that ""The Matrix Reloaded"" was less than stellar. It was after all the middle film of a trilogy and thus had no true beginning middle or end -- not to mention the fact that there was absolutely no jeopardy and therefore no dramatic tension. If no one can ever kill Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving sinister as always) and Neo (Keanu Reeves) just keeps destroying version after version of that toothy machine -- which just keeps coming back again and again -- then whats the point? Wheres the drama? (Actually Agent Smith has a real agenda in this final chapter but why give away the films only plot point.) ""The Matrix Revolutions"" weve come to the end of the road and finally someone -- or something -- has to triumph in the final reel. Ill give you two guesses who wins. You can almost hear the late Peggy Lee singing ""Is That All There Is?"" Fans likely will be reading all kinds of special messages into every second of this film. Religious references and Eastern philosophy run rampant; there are plenty of Zen moments. Also every single twitch and gesture by Neo Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) and the Oracle (Mary Alice) can be analyzed ad nauseam for their supposedly deep inner meanings. Neo continues to be a custom-made role for Reeves limited talents. The fact that his one-dimensional character is dazed and confused throughout most of the film fits Reeves performance style to a T. Top-line effects flatlined humanity The cast also includes Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus Collin Chou as Seraph and Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity. As stated above the special effects are spectacular and the final attacks on Zion are amazing -- too long but amazing. But the emotional impact of this movie is zilch. When Moss and Reeves lock lips it looks like two wire coat hangers trying to get it on. Theres also an interesting trip to a Matrix nightspot called Club Hell. The Wachowskis must have emptied every Samp;M and leather store in Australia (the films shooting location) in order to dress the extras in this scene. After living in New York and L.A. I thought I had seen everything. I was wrong. OK creating this trilogy was no mean feat. It is a major accomplishment and will go down in cinematic history -- for special effects and marketing in particular. But when it comes to a film standing the test of time the audience must have an emotional attachment with the story. A bunch of emotion-free humans dressed in black wearing sunglasses and millions of computer-generated machines doesnt fill that bill. ""The Matrix Revolutions"" opens in simultaneous worldwide release on Wednesday November 5 and is rated R. The movie comes from Warner Bros. a division of Time Warner as is CNN.

Those who never really bought into the ""Matrix"" faith in the first place will feel vindicated by ""The Matrix Revolutions"" the third and one can safely assume the last installment in the saga of Neo and his Brethren. You can virtually see the mystique peeling away while beholding the turgid melodrama patchy plotting windy dialogue and yes spectacular combat effects of this grand finale to the point where the One is revealed as having no clothes -- or at most a fashionable black undergarment. If ""Reloaded"" generally disappointed ""Revolutions"" deflates leaving Warner Bros. with a big holiday attraction that will have trouble reversing the sense of diminished expectations going in and tepid word-of-mouth coming out. From a series that started in 1999 as an unexpected phenomenon quickly acquiring mythic status and becoming an international style and trendsetter ""The Matrix"" has lost most of its freshness four years later. Its a given that fans who piled into the first two will feel compelled to complete the set which assures smash openings worldwide. (""Revolutions"" will bow simultaneously -- literally at the same hour -- on Nov. 5 in the U.S. and more than 50 other countries including China.) ""The Matrix"" generated 460 million worldwide while ""Reloaded"" raked in 736 million 164 million of that in its first week Stateside. If ""Revolutions"" splits the difference between its two predecessors total theatrical take for the franchise will end up at about 1.75 billion. As its now easy to see much of what intrigued about the original ""Matrix"" apart from its action smarts and fashion sense was how much information it withheld. Whats come since could be equated to a metaphysical striptease with the removal of each piece of narrative obfuscation accorded the weight of a scriptural revelation. What converts have construed as profound has been increasingly exposed as flimsy and conventional to the point where the whole mythology looks no more complex or intriguing than that of ""Star Trek."" Just as he was last seen at the abrupt end of ""Reloaded"" Keanu Reeves Neo lies comatose at the outset here an inconvenience in that the Machines are poised to stage their all-out assault on Zion the grungy last outpost of humanity in 20 hours. Anxious to know what to do Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) now devotedly in love with Neo and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) with resolute belief in Neos Chosen One status set out to see the Oracle (Mary Alice taking over from the late great Gloria Foster). An extensively elaborated layer of ""depth"" discloses that Neo is stuck in a sphere between the real and machine worlds controlled by the repellent Trainman (Bruce Spence) who operates a subway system between the realms. Neo is not allowed on board but Trinity and Morpheus are transported directly to the kinky club where the Albino twins are no longer around to work security. All the same in the films first big action sequence the good guys have to shoot their way in gunning down a bunch of goons in balletic slo-mo as the baddies stride around upside down through the lobby before their confrontation inside with the insidious Merovingian (Lambert Wilson) and his glamour-puss g.f. Persephone (Monica Bellucci who utters maybe a dozen words this time around and whose full-bloom red rose lips go unkissed by Neo or anyone else). When Neo finally escapes limbo and visits the Oracle in her kitchen he asks plenty of direct questions to which he gets answers like ""I see Death"" and ""I see the End coming."" Hell everyone who buys a ticket knows that much but she does add that Neos power extends all the way back to the Source that Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving and his countless duplicates) is Neos negative twin and that It will all be decided tonight. So everyone prepares for the rumble to end all rumbles. While the human tribe of Zion braces for the onslaught Neo announces that hes going to pursue peace by venturing all the way to the Source in the Machine City an impossible folly in the eyes of the ruling council. Giving him her ship headstrong warrior Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith) joined by Morpheus takes up combat on another front. The titanic Siege of Zion commences 70 minutes in as the Machine offensive is launched by a giant drill bit penetrating the enormous concrete ceiling covering the Zion enclave. Through the opening flies the first wave of a seemingly endless supply of Sentinels ferocious mechanized octopi with enormous destructive power. The best defense Zion can mount is anti-aircraft fire coming from individually controlled robots but while the gunners aim is true those Sentinels along with more drill bits just keep on coming in overwhelming numbers. While the battle continues to rage with wearying amounts of noise carnage and chaos Neo and Trinity deal with a tough challenge on board their ship in the person of Bane (Ian Bliss) a Zion fighter who has been taken over by Smith. Bane manages to do grave damage to humankinds hopes by among other things blinding Neo an act that adds a new visual element to the film by allowing him to ""see"" things only in blazing orange-on-black outline. But Neo finally does make it to the Source an Oz-like shape-changing face which is willing to entertain negotiations with Neo. But the big fly in the ointment is Smith who has become so powerful hes broken free of all restraints to operate independently of the Matrix. The expected cataclysmic action is certainly delivered although in a more generalized and generic manner than might have been hoped. But for anyone inclined to take the Wachowski Brothers seriously as highfalutin cineastes or even as undergraduate-level philosophers a stronger sense of dramatic resolution and cosmic synthesis wouldnt be too much to ask for; after all if the public is going to spend many hours wrapped up in an alternate mythology be it one created by Aeschyulus Wagner or Tolkien it deserves some spiritual exaltation along with the thrills. Final images here are perhaps the cheesiest in the entire trilogy and quite lacking in weight and refined meaning. In terms of technical execution and visual imagination the series continues to be a marvel although prolonged exposure makes both Zion and the Machine City darkly unappetizing environments. Key contributors to the dazzling surfaces -- cinematographer Bill Pope production designer Owen Paterson costume designer Kym Barrett visual effects supervisor John Gaeta editor Zach Staenberg composer Don Davis sound designer Dane A. Davis and fight choreographer Yuen Wo Ping prominent among them -- have been amply cited before but are well deserving of deep final bows now. Same might be said of the dedicated cast although thesping opportunities were actually greater and more nuanced in ""Reloaded"" than they are here where the emotional level is more pitched frantic and/or desperate as Armageddon arrives.

"Matrix Revolutions The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; matrix-revolutions-the ) Matrix Revolutions The (United States 2003) A movie review by James Berardinelli The Matrix Revolutions represents a disappointing way for the science fiction trilogy to bow out. Overlong and underwhelming The Matrix Revolutions reinforces the thinking that itas a rare movie series in which the final chapter is the strongest. In this installment the intelligence and ideas that formed one of the cornerstones of the original The Matrix and were still in evidence in The Matrix Reloaded have been shunted aside in favor of computer-generated action that makes about 1/3 of this movie look like a video game on the big screen. The problems with the film are easy enough to pinpoint. Its pretentious (this was true at least to a degree of its predecessors) - were expected to approach this film with the same solemnity that the Wachowski Brothers do. The action is hackneyed - the slo-mo martial arts stuff was neat the first time but it was already getting old by the time it was re-used in The Matrix Reloaded. Now its past the expiration date and the Wachowskis fail to come up with anything genuinely new or innovative to enhance or improve upon it. The pacing is uneven - the first hour is bogged down with talking and unnecessary exposition; not until the half-way point does the energy level shoot up. And the payoff is weak. Had this been a stand-alone popcorn science fiction adventure it might have been enjoyable but this is a poor way to end a trilogy. Expectations built up by the first two films are not fulfilled. One could be forgiven for anticipating something more momentous than a long shoot-em-up followed by a glorified fistfight. And the ""twist"" if it can be called that is hardly earthshaking. The Matrix Revolutions begins where The Matrix Reloaded ended - with Neo (Keanu Reeves) in a coma after defeating a few sentinels. Actually his mind is stuck in a sort of limbo (that looks like a train station) between the Matrix and the Real World. Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) go in after him and are forced to make a deal with the annoyingly cultured Merovingian (Lambert Wilson) to retrieve him. Meanwhile Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) has found a way to escape from the Matrix in his unending quest to eliminate Neo. The machines are about to finish off Zion and Lock (Harry J. Lennix) is running out of options. Morpheus Link (Harold Perrineau Jr.) and Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith) decide to return to the human city but Neo and Trinity believe their destiny lies elsewhere. So with the fate of mankind riding on their shoulders they head in an unexpected direction. In recent years the line between special effects-focused blockbusters and computer games has been shrinking and The Matrix Revolutions further narrows the gap. All thats missing is a joystick on the theater seat arm rest. The battle for Zion should be tense and suspenseful but the obviousness of the computer generated animation during these sequences damages the ability to suspend disbelief. I didnt ever believe that I was watching humanitys last stand. Instead I felt like I was watching a non-playable demo for a Matrix Revolutions videogame - shoot down as many sentinels as possible before being overwhelmed. The human element is limited to a few familiar faces rather than legitimate characters we actually care about. After playing Superman for the last movie Neo is back to being merely mortal this time around. That makes for some degree of uncertainty about his fate but unfortunately it also requires that Keanu Reeves attempt to do more than stand around looking bemused and cool in black. The Matrix Revolutions expects Reeves to act a little but the moment he tries to show emotion we have to fight back giggles. Sadly Reeves isnt the only one to display acting deficiencies. His co-stars Carrie-Ann Moss and Laurence Fishburne are on auto-pilot. Moss tries (and fails) to make us believe that Trinty truly madly deeply loves Neo. Fishburne had little to do except look stern. The only ones with any real energy are Harold Perrineau Jr. and Jada Pinkett Smith neither of whom has a lot of screen time. The gorgeous Monica Bellucci (as Persephone) is so underused that its inappropriate to label her appearance as anything more than a cameo with her cleavage getting most of the attention. There has been one casting change the enigmatic Oracle is now played by Mary Alice replacing Gloria Foster who died during production of The Matrix Reloaded. When The Matrix Revolutions works it does so as eye candy. Although the first hour drags because of the pontificating about choice and fate (none of the speeches offer anything new) the second hour zips by. The battle sequences may not be as involving as those in say Star Wars but they are done with enough technical savvy to retain the attention of most viewers. And those who are on hand just to see a big-budget special effects extravaganza will be satisfied. Anyone hoping to experience the blend of science fiction philosophy and edgy action that characterized the previous two movies will be disappointed. Nevertheless for completists who need to find out how it ends The Matrix Revolutions provides answers (although not necessarily to all questions) and doesnt cop out when it comes to the final resolution.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (The Matrix Revolution Jasin Boland) C+ The Matrix Revolutions Genre Action/Adventure Sci-fi and Fantasy; Starring Laurence Fishburne Carrie-Anne Moss Keanu Reeves Monica Bellucci Nona Gaye Matt McColm Jada Pinkett Smith Adrian Rayment Neil Rayment Clayton Watson Hugo Weaving; Director Andy Wachowski Lana Wachowski; Author Andy Wachowski Lana Wachowski; Producer (person) Joel Silver; Release Date Wide 11/05/2003; Runtime (in minutes) 130; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted November 3 2003 -- 1200 AM EST ""Where is this going? Where does it end?"" ""Cookies need love like everything else."" ""He did it He saved us He ended the war The Machines are gone"" ""What ze hell??"" That last pronouncement delivered in a full fruity bouquet of an accent by Lambert Wilson as the satanic bon vivant known as the Merovingian is less pithy than the usual level of discourse in The Matrix Revolutions. But after the final rain-soaked showdown between Neo (Keanu Reeves) and his indefatigable opponent Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) in this winded conclusion to the Wachowski brothers epic sci-fi trilogy ze hell of it is this Theres little philosophical distinction between the needs of dessert pastries and those of the good people of Zion in their hemp couture. It seems clearer than ever that these ardent Zionists are brave pre-Christians yearning for a savior to deliver them from evil. And that Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith) who doesnt believe in The One but believes in Neo represents a certain kind of convert while Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) emerging from a spiritual crisis in the last episode is another. And that no one should attempt to make sense of the previous two sentences without first having seen ""The Matrix Reloaded."" So heres a mystery for the faithful Why does resurrection and salvation - the ""Matrix"" payoff - here feel more like a religious obligation than a triumphant revelation? Theres relatively less of the clunky alternation of big action and static speechifying that stalled ""Reloaded."" But theres also less storytelling fervor from the Wachowskis as their hugely influential Big Bang of a movie notion settles for rigged explosions in its final volley. Among its better tricks ""Matrix Revolutions"" finally gets the love-story subplot of Neo and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) in the right proportion Theres little of it as befits the utter monotony of the characters. (The Machines exhibit more passion than these two chess pieces.) The filmmakers have also come up with an inspired solution to the death of actress Gloria Foster who was so outstanding in the role of The Oracle by gently slipping in a fine Mary Alice to play up the seers grandmotherliness. (Representing Eastern religious philosophy the old woman explains that she now wears a new ""shell."") And Pinkett Smith finally gets the spotlight she deserves for her Niobe who is as spunky and appealing as Trinity is pained and cold. ""Revolutions"" features a snazzy ""Star Wars""-y invasion of Zion by Sentinels (and hard-working CGI guys) with much charging and clanging as well as diverting Xena-like heroics by Nona Gaye and Rachel Blackman as a couple of buff weapon-wielding citizens who fight as bravely as any man. It also features a dangerous rallying cry ""Everything that has a beginning has an end"" - risky because the congregational response may well be Hallelujah.
