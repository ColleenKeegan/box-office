Facebook Twitter Print You Got Served The limits of pulp in The Butler and Kick-Ass 2. by Wesley Morris on August 15 2013 Just to be clear its actually not called The Butler. It couldnt simply be called that because the man who directed it also made Precious and that was actually Precious Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire. But dont worry. What could have been The Butler A Movie Adapted From a Wil Haygood Washington Post Article That Was Only Partially About a Butler in the White House is actually just Lee Daniels The Butler. Its ludicrous -- the title I mean. This movie is a mini-monument to mini-monumentality like a tower of motel Bibles. Nonetheless with this much fake hair and real sweat with this much down-and-dirtiness and lack of seriousness passing itself off as high solemnity with this much indecency and entertainment and Dinah Washington and Soul Train with this perfect a balance between bad taste and best intentions who elses movie could The Butler be? Its true that Daniels isnt Spike Lee or Tyler Perry. Hes not a household name. But I dont think thats the point of turning The Butler into Lee Daniels The Butler. Its Lee Danielss movie because its not Stanley Kramers or Rob Reiners. It doesnt have the piety and starchiness and reverence Hollywood usually reserves for a movie that starts in a cotton field in 1926 and ends with Barack Obama in the White House. It doesnt have a white interloper to make the black experience palatable. It has Oprah Winfrey saying ""Get this low-class bitch outta my house"" Daniels has probably seen The Help. He knows we have and he understands that a great deal of its popularity comes from its desperation to sanitize the grimmer aspects of race and racism and the civil rights movement. Hes made a movie that is neither obeisant nor obsequious one that doesnt airbrush and defang history one that actually feels a little bit unsanitary. Its not an interpretation of actual history as much as it is a reduced revision of movie history. The film dichotomizes the civil rights era as a time of servitude and insurrection and puts all that strife at the door of a single black household. The story Wil Haygood wrote in 2008 was a short reported history of black people in the White House. The emotional hook was a butler named Eugene Allen whod served in eight administrations from 1952 to 1986. Haygoods piece was roving but it had a flinty historical recall. Obama hadnt yet entered the White House (the piece ran near Election Day) and the article used historical anecdotes to imply that Obamas odds were long. The benefit of hindsight permits the movie to be more sanguine about assorted presidents relationships to the service staff. Screenwriter Danny Strong first distills Haygoods piece down to the butlers perspective on his employers and pries it free from fact. Allen becomes Cecil Gaines (Forest Whitaker) a family man mild in manner pleased to serve and devoted to his homemaker wife Gloria (Winfrey) and their two sons Louis and Charlie played by David Oyelowo and the very funny Elijah Kelley as adults. The tension between Cecil and Louis gives the film its trumped-up obvious politics. The boy looks at his father who wears a tuxedo at work six days a week and sees a man doing nothing to advance civil rights -- Cecil enters the White House during the Eisenhower administration and leaves during Reagans second term. Almost out of rebellion against his father Louis attends protests drops out of Fisk becomes a Freedom Rider then a righteous jailbird a member of the Black Panthers and finally an anti-apartheid activist. Cecil worries about and resents his sons truculence not because he doesnt sympathize necessarily but because he understands the danger of the fight; he can overhear presidents discussing the risks. What were dealing with here is a true trash artist and the craziest filmmaker in America right now. Yes this is the sort of movie in which a character happens to be present for every important historical conversation and revelation. Anytime a remark is made in the Oval Office about racial politics or civil rights theres Cecil coming or going or standing stock still with a silver tray. Ordinarily that trick would result in an iffy memoir. Or its Forrest Gump. Since Cecil performs the narration The Butler achieves the preposterousness of both. But theres something here thats impossible to dismiss as old-school TV-movie hokeyness -- or as a riff on the lessons wisdom and schematic episodic storytelling structure of say The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman. (Of course the dreary old-age makeup which brings Whitaker and Winfrey too close to Troma Entertainment for comfort is a different story.) Daniels doesnt try to protect us from the mess of these four decades or the point-blank murder that opens the film in 1926. He doesnt romanticize the Gaines middle-class life. Its utterly earthbound. Gloria drinks and smokes but not abusively. Theres something adulterous going on with her good-looking no-good front-toothless neighbor (Terrence Howard) but the years (and the script and maybe even Winfreys vanity) straighten out the character morally so that her lapses dont seem entirely careless. The woman feels real. So do the men and women with whom Cecil works. Daniels likes murk and chaos and excess. He appreciates the stinky pull of luridness and the dark comedy that sometimes comes with it. And his rhythms have always been weird. Theres a sequence that crosscuts a semi-baroque White House banquet (brown hands slipping into white gloves; a grand choreographed entrance; a vague air of proud black hauteur) with Louis and the Fisk kids training in a basement as members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee for their sit-in at a Woolworth counter. The kids white and black invade the whites-only section while the black butlers elaborately serve only whites. Daniels juxtaposes one highly civilized affair against another whose civility is ripped away. We see the students including Louiss future girlfriend Carol (Yaya Alafia formerly DaCosta) put through a practice wringer only to suffer the real thing at the hands of white racists their own age. The camera looks up from the counter and during the training up from the floor while at the White House it seems to float above the dinner table. Daniels jumps between the performative presentation of food in the government setting and its weaponization at the Woolworth -- kids being slapped squirted and doused with cream ketchup and coffee. Jumping among the three events -- the banquet the training the protest -- is overkill. But its a bizarrely powerful juxtaposition. That sequence is typical Daniels. He likes to overwhelm and dismay and provoke. The Butler is his fourth movie as a director. 2005s Shadowboxer (an erotic thriller with Cuba Gooding Jr. Helen Mirren Joseph Gordon-Levitt and MoNique) Precious and The Paperboy precede it. His production company also gave us the button-pushing sexuality and ethical provocations of both Monsters Ball and The Woodsman which featured Kevin Bacon as an ex-con pedophile. What unites them all to one extent or another is their obsession with luridness -- with sex and violence and violent sex with crime and sensation and pulp. Daniels wants us to feel something everywhere in our bodies except for our heads. Theres no thinking with him. He knows theres a visceral kick to a certain nasty form of movie-making and he isnt afraid to give it to us the tears guts and fried pigs feet; the breasts and erections; the primacy and inhumanity. The first good image we get of Jacqueline Kennedy in The Butler comes after her husbands assassination. While shes a wreck the camera pans up her leg to study the blood on her boucle. We dont even see her face in that scene. Its a rude shot. But for him its honest. Daniels is like Oliver Stone without the intellectual condom. What were dealing with here is a true trash artist and the craziest filmmaker in America right now. Precious and The Paperboy are vulgar triumphs. This might sound like faint praise but only in the churchiest sense as when you stand up before a preacher testify scream ""Hallelujah"" then pass the hell out. Daniels is free of that urge filmmakers of all races have to lift everybody up. For him blackness is beautiful but its also something to be overcome -- the pathologies self-doubts self-loathing. There is a way of being black thats abject and can leave you woebegone. That way of being black is called the blues and Daniels can be a thrillingly bluesy director. The Butler isnt perfect. The last 30 minutes or so arent even very good but the script needs to complete itself. Cecil has to meet Barack and so there are about four scenes -- with old Cecil and old Gloria -- that make you laugh and cringe at the same time. The chief problem with The Butler is that it cant keep still. Theres nothing for an audience to sink into and get lost in. The march from one administration to the next -- and from one dreadful casting choice to another -- starts to feel promiscuous from a dotty Eisenhower (Robin Williams) to a petite and dashing JFK (James Marsden) to a brash LBJ (Liev Schreiber) to a soppy Nixon (John Cusack) and a moony Ronald Reagan (Alan Rickman). Cecil interacts with each president but hes written as a bystander for too much of the movie. Whitaker wears a short brown rug on his head and too much makeup (the movie is so far from Eugene Allens life that he really doesnt have to look like anyone specific so why not have him look like Forest Whitaker?) but the quick emotional flashes that are the key to Whitakers acting dont arrive. The performance is merely steady like two hours watching a pilot light. Even so Daniels remains such a confident director of actors that you have to wonder how much worse off Whitaker might have been without him. Winfrey has never been a natural actress. She had carriage but her line readings tend to be stiff and her face is rarely expressive. The highly quotable force-of-nature work she did in The Color Purple made no sense in a misbegotten yet misunderstood movie like Beloved. This performance is a breakthrough. She doesnt need that sorrowful blow-the-house-down stuff anymore. She no longer has to perform authority. She trusts herself to radiate it. You dont believe her as a housewife but you dont believe her in the right way because shes too glamorous to stay home. Winfreys not a mother. Shes a matriarch. The thing to love about Daniels is his sense of campiness and kitsch the idea that nothing is above reproach. Nothing can be taken out of historical or artistic proportion. In the first 10 minutes he frames Mariah Carey (as Cecils mother) and Vanessa Redgrave (as Cecils owner) with the same deadened face from almost the same angle so that you cant tell which of them is the acting legend. The Butler doesnt care that none of the men playing any of those presidents -- or the women playing their wives -- is right for the part. Minka Kelly is Jackie O Cusack makes a comically pathetic Nixon. He appears to be melting before our eyes. Nelsan Ellis plays Martin Luther King Jr. and doesnt go for too much. He just mingles with his staff in his room at the Lorraine Motel being casually wise. Then theres Jane Fonda who has a few short scenes of overwinking irony as Nancy Reagan. Theres an amusing shot of her making an exit using Reagans borderline-seasick walk. You can imagine Fonda being pleased to lampoon Nancys occasional lack of grace. A lot of what this miscasting does is restore these icons to an approachable human scale. But once the kitsch and campiness take hold its hard for Daniels to free himself from them. A scene between two characters standing amid Southern slave quarters gets a big laugh because the two characters are wearing vinyl 227-era tracksuits. But those sorts of unserious details start to matter over on Louiss half of the movie. (Hes Jenny to Cecils Forrest.) As he and Carol travel through the greatest and worst hits of the civil rights movement (they too are present for most iconic moments) as preppies Panthers and protesters clad in kente cloth it begins to feel like Halloween. The Afros and black berets and cut-out shirts and dashikis are wearing them instead of the other way around. With historical events Danielss knowingly disrespectful kind of badness has its limits. He might have wanted to show us how to make an irreverent historical epic. But hes just reimagined Saturday Night Live as sketch dramedy. People really like Chloe Grace Moretz in the Kick-Ass movies. She plays a foul-mouthed vigilante called Hit Girl. Originally the gag was that an 11-year-old had a dirtier mouth and faster hands than Nicolas Cage who played her dad. In Kick-Ass 2 shes 15 and both Cage and the thrill are gone. A tough trash-talking tween was a naughty novelty. But throw a rock and youll hit the teenage version. The first movie which Matthew Vaughn directed gave us ordinary people who wanted to be comic-book superheroes. It had the kind of high energy that could distract you from how appallingly that energy was deployed. Of course being appalling seemed to be that movies point. The sequel is also based on comic books by Mark Millar and John Romita Jr. but was adapted and directed by Jeff Wadlow whose previous movie was 2008s adolescent-boy fight bulletin Never Back Down a stupid but fascinating brawl-a-thon that feels like more of a comic book than these civilian superhero movies -- its Kick-Ass too. Wadlows sequel has a blunt literal vulgarity. One characters slatternly alter ego is ""Night Bitch."" Christopher Mintz-Plasse resumes his part as the movies lisping douche-geek villain and he comes up with a new name for his character after frying his mother in a tanning bed and finding her Samp;M paraphernalia. Mintz-Plasse sells it. (Hes like an undergrad Ed Helms.) But after 20 minutes its clear that subversive wit or big ideas wont be factors for Round 2. (Oh and Morris Chestnut and John Leguizamo are on hand for glorified butler duty.) Once again Aaron Taylor-Johnson is Dave Lizewski a New York City high school nerd who becomes Kick-Ass by night and once again he manages to be more interesting than almost anybody you can imagine in a role this generic (hes 23 and can act; that helps). Its not Tobey Maguires Peter Parker. But thats only because the material doesnt give Taylor-Johnson a lot to perform. Moretz tries to toughen him up for crime-fighting which her character Mindy reluctantly renounces. Instead she becomes a plain-old high school girl. So Dave joins a league of homemade heroes which includes Donald Faison and Jim Carrey in a crew cut and disfiguring face makeup. The sequel has some good gags too. High school plus Hit Girl basically equals Heathers. But all the wonder and surprise of the first movie is gone. Its just aping the violence in other movies and other comic books. It doesnt feel quite real but it doesnt feel fantastical either. That violence drove Carrey whos 51 and a dad now to risk spending the rest of his life as a Comic-Con villain by renouncing his participation citing the Sandy Hook-ness of it all. But the fact that he spends the movie dressed like an impostor of himself suggests he had kind of changed his mind before the cameras even began rolling.

Jackson is provocative body parts getting lopped off is exciting 10 cops getting slaughtered is darkly humorous and people projectile-vomiting into each others faces is hysterical. I am not that audience. If you are though I guess ""Kick-Ass 2"" delivers. The film is the not-exactly-demanded sequel to a 2010 movie based on the comic book about father-and-daughter crimefighters. Nicolas Cage at his most entertainingly oddball was the Batman-styled Big Daddy; Chloe Grace Moretz was his precocious sidekick Hit Girl. Cage definitely had fun channeling Adam West and the first movie sometimes had a bright comic-book look. But the tone was off even then. The gore was explicit enough to be disgusting but not extreme enough to be satiric; the film outraged without being outrageous. ""Kick-Ass 2"" is a step down. Although theres still something sweet deep-down in the concept -- average Americans without any special powers dress up as superheroes to fight crime -- its not developed with any particular wit or imagination. Cage is gone and theres nothing fresh in this sequels returning characters or the supervillains they face. And while director Jeff Wadlow handles the action capably at least when it comes to Hit Girls hyper-callisthenic style the rest of the film feels as slapdash as the first; there isnt even an attempt to hide the Toronto area codes store names and street signs visible everywhere in its ""New York"" locations. Which would actually be a funny idea for a movie someday -- having its characters pretend to be in Manhattan while standing in front of obvious Canadian landmarks. I mean heaven knows this movie could use some ideas. Any ideas. (The final ""battle"" -- with dozens of costumed nerds attacking each other -- looks like a cranky disagreement at Comic Con and a high-school subplot is a steal from ""Mean Girls"" of all things.) Even the things the film depends on for shock value -- foul language explosive diarrhea and bloody sadism -- arent even that shocking. Theyre just gross. In fact one of the stars -- Jim Carrey who plays a military-style hero called Colonel Stars and Stripes -- has already disavowed the film as being too violent. Hes outraged Outraged I tell you (Although tell me Jim now that your check has cleared -- how did you think that scene where you sic a dog on a bound mans genitals was going to play?) As it is nothing plays very well. Although Aaron Taylor-Johnson is technically the lead - he plays the titular crimefighter -- he makes absolutely no impression. A hard-working Christopher Mintz-Plasse ekes out a few laughs as a villain whose name cant be printed here. Carrey meanwhile under some rubbery prosthetics plays the whole thing pretty straight -- a relief perhaps to anyone who suffered through his Riddler in ""Batman Forever"" but not exactly the jolt of life this movie desperately needs. If it works at all fitfully its because of the precociously talented and in-control Moretz who basically carries the entire film on her own small shoulders. She snaps out her lines with verve and authority; she has a wonderful physicality in her no-joke fight scenes. And she does a lot with a little -- in one quiet scene she conveys a depth of feeling simply by the way she walks away from the camera. But she should have kept walking. And so should we. Ratings note The film contains gory violence nudity sexual situations and strong language. Kick-Ass 2 (R) Universal (113 min.) Directed by Jeff Wadlow.

TWITTER Hit Girl is an equal co-star in the follow-up to 2010s hit about teen crimefighters. Real-world(ish) teen crime fighters are back in Kick-Ass 2 a sequel that responds to controversy by doubling down on both the violence and the unexpected streak of nastiness that troubled some viewers the first time around. Batons are passed -- from director Matthew Vaughn to newcomer Jeff Wadlow; from Nicolas Cage to this episodes marquee-worthy ringer Jim Carrey -- for an outing in which first-film scene-stealer Chloe Grace Moretz is as much a protagonist as the titular hero played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson. The film delivers almost exactly what fans of the first installment are hoping for and should perform accordingly at the box office. Whereas Kick-Ass was aligned to the teen male perspective both in its comic book narrative -- in which Taylor-Johnsons Dave despite being an ordinary kid decided to dress up and fight crime -- and in its occasional nods to horny high school comedy this one lets the young man retain voice-over privileges while spreading the narrative identification around. Here Moretzs character is not just the focus of action sequences -- her ""Hit Girl"" alter ego youll recall was trained for combat from childhood -- but of school-hallway dramas that offer a nice balance with Daves girl troubles. PHOTOS 20 Stars Who Dissed Their Own Movies Forced to socialize with the most popular clique in school by her guardian Marcus (Morris Chestnut) -- and realizing after a visceral encounter with boy-band music videos that being a normal girl might fulfill her in ways her samurai swords and nunchucks cant -- Moretzs Mindy Macready enters a familiar teen-pic template Shes introduced to the privileges of popularity only to be humiliated by mean girls bent on protecting their turf. This storyline eventually reaches a satisfying (if cartoonish) conclusion but its main effect is to make Mindy a civilian long enough for Daves costumed alter ego to enjoy some heroic action that isnt upstaged by Hit Girl. After the first films events dozens of other normal folks have been inspired to adopt crime-fighting personae; Kick-Ass teams with some of them under the moniker Justice Forever. The only combat-ready member of the team is Colonel Stars and Stripes (Carrey) an ex-mob enforcer who knows where villains congregate and has the nerve to take them on. VIDEO Kick-Ass 2 Extended Red Band Trailer Carrey under some jawline-enhancing prosthetics plays the part with enough righteous zeal to arouse suspicion. As he leads the team to take down kingpins of gambling and prostitution might he be clearing the underworld field for his own return to crime? Either way a new villain is busy empire-building Chris DAmico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) the spoiled rich kid who spent the last film trying to be a hero has rechristened himself ""The Motherf---er"" and hired all the thugs he can find in order to destroy Kick-Ass and those he cares about. As his name suggests this creeps agenda is not PG-rated In one scene he rapes someone close to Kick-Ass an event made more disturbing by the laughs the script hopes to get from it. In that scene and elsewhere the films tone comes close to implosion. Central to the franchises appeal is its insistence that real people are doing these things -- that as the dialogue twice insists ""this is not a comic book."" The first film cheated that premise by making Hit Girl capable of impossibly choreographed mayhem; this one goes further on that front and on others as well. The indulgences may not bother the geek contingent but they make it harder to distinguish Kick-Ass from the polished name-brand superhero flicks it seemed to offer us respite from.

Grade D Mark Millar creator of the ""Kick-Ass"" comic books and executive producer of the movies said his favorite moments feature the title heros black-belt friend Hit-Girl. He gave an example ""Shes just killed a man and swears and shes tiny I think the impact of that is amazing. Then before you can catch your breath you see her wiping everyone out. Its startling to watch."" In ""Kick-Ass 2"" with Hit-Girl aging from 11 to 15 that cheap frisson has lost its thrill. Chloe Grace Moretz once again plays Hit-Girl and best buddy to Aaron Taylor-Johnsons Kick-Ass. She still offers some infectious eagerness and acrobatic energy. But her trademark - spewing obscenities like a graphic-novel Marine and committing dexterous and lavish homicides - is one thin novelty act. She can vary it only by growing more hyperbolic. That happens at the start of ""Kick-Ass 2."" In this film all over the New York City area ordinary citizens don masks and costumes in the hope of becoming a ""real-life"" superhero just as average teenager Dave Lizewski did when he took on the identity of Kick-Ass. (Its extra-super-heroic for them because they dont have Lizewskis numbed nerve endings.) Similarly ultra-nasty people from all over the world put on more forbidding masks and costumes to become super-villains in the pay of the heros archenemy Chris DAmico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) who transforms himself into super-villain-in-chief with a name that cant be quoted in a family newspaper. Any saving ironic grace to the mayhem gets lost in the inept jazzed-up action and foul humor. Since Hit-Girl in her normal Mindy Macready guise now goes to the same high school as Lizewski writer-director Jeff Wadlow has decided to include a bunch of dumb nauseating ""mean girl"" jokes. In the slender plot Lizewski bored with everyday life becomes Kick-Ass again hoping to team up with Hit-Girl as a real-life ""daring duo."" But under the guidance of her policeman guardian Sgt. Marcus Williams (Morris Chestnut) Hit-Girl tries to become a typical teenage girl (we know it wont last). Kick-Ass then joins up with a fledgling league of self-made superheroes ""Justice Forever"" led by Col. Stars and Stripes (Jim Carrey). They enjoy some gory success at battling bad guys - until DAmicos evil minions whirl into murderous action. In 2010 Time magazine predicted that ""Kick-Ass"" was going to ""redefine the superhero movie genre."" But the ""Kick-Ass"" series never redefined anything. It merely took the base appeals of a certain kind of superhero movie - a violent fantasy of potency a bloody revenge of the nerd - and pushed the dial to 11 with the help of an 11-year-old girl. The core audience of comic book readers did embrace the movie. But they didnt love it because its stripped-down burlesque teen/tween tale of a regular kid who is determined to become a superhero was different from parts of ""Spider-Man."" They loved it because it was more of the same - much more with what Alex in ""A Clockwork Orange"" would have called ""a touch of the ultra-violence real savage."" ""Kick-Ass 2"" even lacks authentic oddity. The only actor providing a genuine touch of out-of-this-world lunacy is Carrey and he plays a minor character. Comic book author Millar made a revealing confession three years ago. Because hed heard that novelist Ian McEwan supposedly ""went soft after his kid was born"" Millar after his daughter was born started ""purposely making my stuff more bad taste"" so that people couldnt accuse him of ""losing his edge."" Wadlow works in the same self-consciously offensive spirit.

Now in writer/director Jeff Wadlows witless and unnecessary sequel all of those assets have been replaced with tone-deaf jokes and cringe-inducing carnage. Picking up a few years after the cartoonishly clever events of the first film (which was directed by Matthew Vaughn here in a producer role) Taylor-Johnsons Dave Lizewski is a high school senior whos hung up his lime-green unitard and Kick-Ass alter ego to focus on fitting in. Meanwhile Moretzs Mindy Macready is now a hormone-addled teenage orphan grappling with Cages dying wish that she leave her pain-inducing pint-sized Hit Girl persona behind. Problem is both of them are bored silly. They miss the thrill of street justice on the sly. While Mindy tries to make friends with a clique of popular mean girls swooning over boy bands and shopping sprees Dave searches for new partners in crime-fighting and finds them in Justice Forever a ragtag posse of hapless (and unfunny) spandex-clad wannabe enforcers led by Jim Carreys sadistic Colonel Stars and Stripes. Carrey whos publicly disavowed Kick-Ass 2s ultra violence in the wake of the Sandy Hook tragedy manages to bring some loose-screw electricity to the film. But hes right about the movies overall tone. It glamorizes videogame-style bloodshed never quite finding the line between satire and nihilism. All heroes whether theyre blessed with supernatural gifts or not require a villain of course. And here the film makes a misstep recycling Christopher Mintz-Plasses Red Mist character from the original Kick-Ass and turning him into a lisping bondage-gear-wearing baddie who christens himself ""The Motherf--er"". Hes as painfully unfunny as his name. Will his evil plan to bring down Kick-Ass force Mindy to pick up her nunchucks and Hit Girl costume again? Take a wild guess. Moretz who is 16 now cant manufacture the same thats-so-wrong jolt she managed the first time around. Back then it was hilariously taboo to see a little girl spout arias of profanity. Now shes just another teenager swearing. Like the rest of the film what was once shocking now just elicits a shrug.

Adam Nayman Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Aug. 16 2013 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Aug. 16 2013 1144AM EDT Comments AA Directed by Jeff Wadlow Written by Jeff Wadlow Starring Aaron Taylor-Johnson Chloe Grace Moretz Classification 14A Genre action Country USA Language English Its a big story that Jim Carrey withdrew his support for Kick-Ass 2 based on its violent content. One wonders if the actor - whose role in the sequel as a star-spangled sociopath is really just an extended cameo - was ready to stand behind the scene where high school girls projectile vomit after being zapped with cattle prods. Or the one where a super-villain comes up short in his attempt to rape his nemesiss lover due to a case of erectile dysfunction. Multimedia Kick-Ass 2 The official trailer Arriving at the tail end of blockbuster season this cheaply produced sequel to the surprise 2011 hit arrives in plenty of time to claim the title of the years most unpleasant movie. But theres nothing transgressive about the shock tactics here. Aaron Taylor-Johnson returns as the titular teenaged vigilante as does Chloe Grace Moretz as the pint-sized Hit Girl once again squeezed into skintight purple leather that suggests a flesh-and-blood anime figure. A subplot where Hit Girl is ostracized by some classmates and exacts a nasty revenge seems like a dry run for Moretzs performance in the upcoming Carrie remake; elsewhere the filmmakers borrow from virtually every comic-book movie ever made while retaining a smug sense of superiority toward the genre (one throwaway line mocks Stan Lee fan boys). Based on this wretchedly produced effort they havent earned it.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Dave as Kick-Ass (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) teams with Mindy as Hit-Girl (Chloe Grace Moretz) in ""Kick-Ass 2."" (Daniel Smith) By Ann Hornaday August 15 2013 Follow AnnHornaday How do you solve a problem like ""Kick-Ass""? The franchise based on the comic book by Mark Millar and John Romita Jr. occupies a specific narrowly focused sliver of the pop-culture universe straddling graphic violence and playful innocence cynicism and sweetness paint-peeling vulgarity and winsome charm. In 2010s ""Kick-Ass"" those contradictions slammed together with giddily subversive brio thanks in large part to a fearless performance by Chloe Grace Moretz whose character Hit-Girl -- a purple-haired dervish decked out in motorcycle leathers a short plaid skirt and a mean pair of nunchucks -- became an instant avatar for third (or is it fourth?) wave feminism and middle school girls empowerment. Hit-Girl returns in ""Kick-Ass 2"" still with the face of an angel the mouth of a stevedore and the pugilistic chops of a skilled Mixed Martial Arts fighter. Having lost her beloved father Big Daddy (played in the previous film by Nicolas Cage) Hit-Girl -- known in the civilian world as Mindy Macready -- is now a high school freshman living with her guardian Marcus (Morris Chestnut) and regularly skipping school to save the world. When Dave Lizewski (a.k.a. the DIY superhero of the films title played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson) asks Mindy to join him to form a dynamic duo she declines at first. ""Im in the NFL Dave"" she says with her signature snarl. ""You play pee wee."" In ""Kick-Ass 2"" all of New York is awash in homemade save-the-dayers well-meaning goofballs who stitch up capes polish their origin stories and set out to fight crime with bumbling vigilante earnestness. They finally meet their match in the villain previously known as Red Mist (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) now decked out in patent leather Samp;M accessories and having changed his nom de plume to an unprintable epithet. Meanwhile Mindy after vowing to Marcus that she would leave her Hit-Girl persona behind is battling the fiercest opponents of her career high school Mean Girls whose cliques and casual cruelties are far more lethal than anything shes encountered. The scenes of Mindy putting the Queen Bees in their places are the most enjoyable sequences of ""Kick-Ass 2"" directed by Jeff Wadlow with efficiency if not inspiration. There are some hilariously witchy ""Heathers""-worthy exchanges in one girls innocently pink-swathed room and when Mindy tries out during a highly sexualized dance team audition she blows the crowd away when she decides shed rather fight than bump and grind. Even at the ripe age of 23 Taylor-Johnson proves to be a surprisingly convincing adolescent boy his cheeks flushing persuasively when he begs Mindy to join him on his mission. Their chemistry is disarmingly palpable and honest. ""Youre smart youre funny youre beautiful and youre the strongest person Ive ever met"" he says besottedly at one point. Now thats romance. Still with so much going for it ""Kick-Ass 2"" cant quite sustain its own contradictions As a post-Tarantino commentary on screen violence it tries to neutralize its moments of brutality -- along with dashes of racism and homophobia -- by putting quotes around them. But the sadistic carnage is also clearly the movies chief selling point. (Co-star Jim Carrey whos nearly unrecognizable as one of Daves would-be teammates grew so squeamish about the films violence that he refused to help promote it.) Tinged with genuine tragedy ""Kick-Ass 2"" provides a highly-pitched backdrop for Dave and Mindy to question their own fealty to solving problems through brute force. But those moral arguments are all but drowned out by the films increasingly sadistic set pieces culminating in a Grand Guignol of vicious bloodletting and death. Like its own protagonists ""Kick-Ass 2"" cant decide what it wants to be when it grows up a vessel for unhinged vengeance and destruction or a meta-critique of those same impulses. In going for both it winds up being neither.  R. At area theaters.

Starring Aaron Taylor-Johnson Chloe Grace Moretz and Christopher Mintz-Plasse. Directed by Jeff Wadlow. (R. 103 minutes.) A weird mix of the refreshing and the dispiriting ""Kick-Ass 2"" is appealing in its brutal honesty and repellent in its honest brutality. Writer-director Jeff Wadlow establishes a premise and follows it without compromise but the trail leads to a very ugly place. In the end the journey wasnt really worth it. Yet here and there there is much to enjoy and even respect. The super heroine Hit Girl (a.k.a. Mindy) is in high school now trying to navigate the social waters and discover who she is when shes not killing people. The stakes are extreme but the emotions are familiar and Chloe Grace Moretz brings out Mindys doubt and inner conflict. Clearly somebody (the director for one) cared about the performances. For example theres Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Chris the mobsters son who longs to be a tough guy. In ""Kick-Ass 2"" he takes a sick turn in the aftermath of his fathers death. He decides he wants to become an evil superhero. He devises a costume made up partly of his late mothers sado-masochistic leather gear and takes on the ridiculous and unprintable name of the Mother-. The name is perfect for him exactly what an idiot might think of as cool but just because Chris really is an idiot doesnt mean that he isnt truly madly and deeply evil. The result is not only an entertaining character but one thats practically a statement. Chris is a lightweight and a joke and yet hes dangerous and hes genuinely destructive. Thats a combination we dont often see in movies but its one all too familiar to history. The title character Kick-Ass (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is still in high school. Hes not tough but he wants to be and he hopes Hit Girl will give him lessons. To further his career as a do-gooder he joins up with a band of would-be superheroes people as powerless as himself who want to make a difference. The story of ""Kick-Ass 2"" involves the group of evil superheroes led by Chris targeting Kick-Ass new group for death. At a certain point ""Kick-Ass 2"" must leave the setup stage and start delivering on the action. It has to move from depictions of Mindys high school angst and Chris psychotic plans and show the outright war that it keeps promising. And thats where the movie begins to sour because all of a sudden a film thats funny in a caustic and outrageous way becomes an action movie thats nasty in an outrageous and violent way. Major characters are stabbed in the neck or run through with a sword and while in one sense the harshness of the comedy is a match for the harshness of the violence somehow laughing one second and cringing the next doesnt make for a pleasurable experience - especially as it all ultimately lands in a zone of pointlessness. Jim Carrey who does nice character work in ""Kick-Ass 2"" as a former mob enforcer who got religion has since disowned the movie on moral terms because of the violence. The violence just might make audiences disown it too not because theyll disapprove but simply because they wont want to sit through it. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Not only is its successor played-out but it revels in carnage while lacking the visual style and gleeful humor of the original.The 2010 film had a fresh and irreverent concept nerds donning capes and fighting crime as well as a mysterious father-daughter superhero duo played with just enough oddball eccentricity by Nicolas Cage and Chloe Grace Moretz.This cynical follow-up ( 1/2 out of four; rated R; opens Friday nationwide) feels stale but also amped-up with more brutal violence. Its hard not to reject a film in which 10 police officers are casually slayed along with countless other innocent folks.Jeff Wadlow wrote and directed this tone-deaf installment (Matthew Vaughn was the writer/director of the original). Where the first film mocked action-movie cliches this retread is mired in them.REVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersMoretz as Hit-Girl/Mindy Macready was an inventive comic-book figure -- a little girl working alongside her beloved caped crusader father who was killed by baddies toward the end. Now shes a ninth-grader and has been adopted by Marcus Williams (Morris Chestnut) a policeman pal of her dads who laments that Mindy never had a childhood. He is intent on making Mindys high school years normal.In the first film Dave Lizewski (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) decided to become a superhero taking the name of Kick-Ass and donning a homemade costume. The only problem was that he had no superpower. That notion offered a way to both send up and celebrate the genre. Powered only by determination Kick-Ass lived up to his titular moniker.Now a high school senior Dave approaches Mindy/Hit-Girl to be his mentor. She helps him improve his fighting skills for a while but then shes persuaded to settle in and be an ordinary high school student. Courted then deceived by a small group of mean girls she exacts her revenge with a weapon that triggers gallons of projectile vomit and other emissions. Did this suddenly become an Adam Sandler movie?Mindy misses her dad and the good old days when theyd take to the streets in masks and rid the world of bad guys. So more than hour into the movie she dons her Hit-Girl suit and sassy purple wig and goes back to doing what she does best.In the interim Dave/Kick-Ass has joined up with other masked vigilantes led by the gung-ho Colonel Stars and Stripes (Jim Carrey who has since denounced the film for its violence). But these good guys are targeted by vengeful Chris DAmico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and his crew of killers. Chris had a jot of humanity in the first film but now hes just an unmitigated psychopath with an annoying nasal voice and an unprintable alter-ego name.STORY Young actors pals offscreen enemies on in Kick-Ass 2VIDEO Kick-Ass 2 stars talk NSFW names guilty pleasures and more MORE Moretz grows up with Kick-Ass 2 heroine Hit-GirlMoretz was the highlight of the first film as she is here. But the novelty of seeing a very young girl morph into a tough-as-nails avenger taking down dozens of grown men has worn off now that Mindy is a teen.Intended for smirks if not outright laughs Dave wears a T-shirt with the words ""I Hate Reboots"" across the front. Lacking the inventive kicks of the original this is a movie that will only underscore that sense of loathing. 61 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 19 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/14A5WPdSummer Movies Calendar AugustTake a look at the films heading to the box office this August complete with trailers reviews clips related stories and more.

More about Kick-Ass 2 >> In the annals of sequeldom Kick-Ass 2 has to be one of the lamest follow-ups ever. Everything that was novel and cool about the 2010 adaptation of the Mark Millar/John Romita Jr. misfit-teens superhero spoof has been turned conventional - Comic-Con conventional - and not cool at all. Deploying cheesy upper-corner panel captions (""Meanwhile . . ."") and exhibiting more than a hint of what-do-we-do-now? despair writer-director Jeff Wadlow lines up the originals costumed duo - Chloe Grace Moretzs Hit Girl and Aaron Taylor-Johnsons baton-slinging title character - and sends them packing. Packing heat and packing self-doubts about their place in the high school social strata and the world at large. Moretz 13 at the time snarled and sneered her way through the first film - skillfully hurling nunchakus and profanities her eyes glinting with pipsqueak glee. The actress gives it a shot in Kick-Ass 2 but the joy is gone. Hit Girls alter ego Mindy Macready has sworn to her NYPD detective foster father (Morris Chestnut) that shell study diligently and steer clear of cussing. Both promises are hard to keep (theres a ""swear jar"" brimming with 1 bills) but finally she forsakes the mask cape and purple wig and starts hanging with the cheerleader princesses at Millard Fillmore High. And Taylor-Johnsons Dave Lizewski who donned a homemade costume and became a YouTube sensation when he took to the streets to fight crime (and got viciously pummeled for his efforts) has the itch again. With Hit Girl out of the picture Kick Ass teams with a squad of do-gooding weirdos led by Colonel Stars and Stripes (a jut-jawed just-about-unrecognizable Jim Carrey). They patrol the city in their fanboy (and girl) getups gaining the attention of the media and of demonic rich-kid nerd boy Chris DAmico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) the superhero wannabe from Kick-Ass 1  transforming himself into a supervillain with a name that cannot be printed in this paper. Cartoonishly violent with blood spray vomit spew severed limbs impaled torsos and more Kick-Ass 2 has none of the punky flair of the Matthew Vaughn-directed original. Before he sets out with his troop of loser crimestoppers Stars and Stripes offers some advice to his gang ""Try to have fun. Otherwise whats the point?"" Whats the point indeed?

Photo Credit Daniel Smith advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Self-made superhero Dave Lizewski discovers a league of local crime fighters. Rated R (language violence) BOTTOM LINE A smart edgy sequel that takes its oddball premise to extremes both realistic and ridiculous. CAST Aaron Taylor-Johnson Chloe Grace Moretz Jim Carrey LENGTH 143 Movies comics and the real world crash together in surprising and uncanny ways in ""Kick-Ass 2"" the further adventures of the self-made superhero Dave Lizewski (Aaron Taylor-Johnson). Its a smart edgy unpredictable action-comedy the tonal opposite of overwrought sculptures like ""Man of Steel."" In the world of the ""Kick-Ass"" movies theres still something funny about a guy in tights. Theres a lot going on this overstuffed but entertaining episode. Dave is training with little Mindy ""Hit-Girl"" Macready (Chloe Grace Moretz) whose Kewpie-doll face combat skills and salty language made her a fan favorite in the 2010 original. Now a teenager Mindy is battling a whole new force of evil -- namely popular girls. Meanwhile as the comics-style headings tell us wealthy Chris DAmico (an entertaining Christopher Mintz-Plasse) the son of a crime-lord whom Dave killed vows revenge from his Long Island headquarters. Swiping his mothers bondage costume including a feather boa he becomes a supervillain called The MF (thats the family version at least). Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Energetically directed and sharply written by franchise newcomer Jeff Wadlow ""Kick-Ass 2"" spoofs the superhero genre while respecting its deeper truths. Theres absurdity in the notion of the Justice Forever League a caped-crusader support-group but the various origin stories (a missing child a bullied gay man) tend to hit home. Mindys temptation to join the cool crowd and lose her Hit-Girl identity is an insightful feminist parable that could have been its own movie. And The MF is a spot-on rich-kid caricature who names his cronies after racist stereotypes (""archetypes"" he insists) and models his evil lair after a VIP strip club. But what about the R-rated violence which caused Jim Carrey -- rather good in a broad but almost straight-faced turn as the Christian superhero Colonel Stars and Stripes -- to publicly disavow ""Kick-Ass 2"" in the wake of the Sandy Hook shootings? The violence is mostly cartoonish like the terrific showdown between tiny Hit-Girl and a bikini-clad behemoth called Mother Russia (Olga Kurkulina) and the realistic moments are what keep this movie from lapsing into predictability.

"Kick-Ass 2 is like a bloody boot to the head review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesKick-Ass 2 is like a bloody boot to the head reviewThe first Kick-Ass was a smart and funny fantasy about vigilante justice. The vile sequel wallows in mayhem and blood.Jim Carrey left and Aaron Taylor-Johnson star in Kick-Ass 2.  (Daniel Smith / MCT)  Chloe Grace Moretz stars in Kick-Ass 2.  (Daniel Smith / MCT)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Aug. 15 2013Kick-Ass 2Starring Aaron Taylor-Johnson Chloe Grace Moretz Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Jim Carrey. Written and directed by Jeff Wadlow. At major theatres. 14A. Numerous ironic references to ""the real world"" in the appalling overkill that is Kick-Ass 2 come like a boot to the head. Theyre intended to remind us as if we needed it that the ultra-violent material were watching hails from the realm of comic books. Article Continued BelowWriter/director Jeff Wadlow (TVs Bates Motel) hopes critics will give this vile and scattershot movie sequel the same break many of them gave to the 2010 original directed by Matthew Vaughn which starred Aaron Taylor-Johnson as the title vigilante and a pre-teen Chloe Grace Moretz as his violent ally Hit-Girl. I was one of those admiring critics back then writing that Kick-Ass ""succeeds as a violent fantasy about our perilous and fretful times where regular citizens feel compelled to take action against a social order rotting from within."" I thought it had something to say about modern fears and obsessions.I can muster no such enthusiasm this time for a franchise that now appears to be rotting from within and lacking any defence of satire or social commentary. It no longer seems very smart (the YouTube and texting references are so 2010) and its also not much fun anymore.Indeed while watching the escalating atrocities in Kick-Ass 2 I found myself playing a little game. I wondered what exactly in the film had prompted the co-starring Jim Carrey now an anti-gun crusader in the wake of last Decembers Sandy Hook school massacre to recently tweet his disdain for and disassociation from the film. He said he ""cannot support that level of violence.""Was Carrey disavowing his ex-military ex-mob character Colonel Stars and Stripes a God-fearing avenger with a mouth full of metal and a penchant for pistols clubs and testicle-gnawing dogs? Was it the massacre of 10 NYPD police officers by a steroidal female psychopath known as Mother Russia (Olga Kurkulina)? Was it the sight of purple-haired Hit-Girl clubbing and slicing street toughs? Or was it the attempted rape of one character by another a man who vows to show a woman what evil penetration feels like?Carrey presumably read the script to Kick-Ass 2 which is based on the comic book series by Mark Millar and John Romita Jr. He might also have seen the first film. There should have been no surprises for him. But figuring out Carreys frame of mind is ultimately as futile as sorting out this misbegotten enterprise which never settles down into a consistent tone least of all one that could justify the extreme violence. At one point it bizarrely tangents into a strange and ugly remake of Mean Girls.The first Kick-Ass had the almost-plausible narrative of lonely and bullied New York teen Dave Lizewski (Taylor-Johnson) using his superhero fantasies a homemade costume and a viral YouTube action video to become a celebrity vigilante he called Kick-Ass. His antics brought him allies an ex-cop Batman wannabe called Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and his foul-mouthed and fleet-footed accomplice Hit-Girl played by his pre-teen daughter Mindy (Moretz).There were also enemies mob leader Frank DAmico (Mark Strong) who considered Kick-Ass a bug who must be squashed and Johnnys spoiled son Chris (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) who created his own vigilante character he calls Red Mist.Much has changed for the sequel. Big Daddy and Johnny G are out of the picture due to previous events and the completely unhinged Chris has switched to playing a fetish-attired super villain he calls The Mother F---er. He leads a nasty group of hired thugs who include the aforementioned psycho Mother Russia with his only connection to his past being his reluctant staff guardian Javier (John Leguizamo).Dave meanwhile has gone back to his bookish ways ""I gave up being a superhero because it was way too dangerous."" Mindy however is having a tougher go of it. Shes trying to settle into being a regular high schooler as her policeman guardian Marcus (Morris Chestnut) demands but she cant put away her Hit-Girl mask and outfit. She feels its her duty and destiny to keep fighting crime.But motivations are tangled this time as both the ""good"" vigilantes and the bad villains revel in bloody mayhem that goes beyond settling scores and into the realm of sadism. Bad writing and direction waste the talents of many good actors among them Taylor-Johnson Moretz and Carrey.The only part of the film that works is the Mean Girls interlude wherein Mindy/Hit-Girl tries to fit in with her schools bitchy cool clique. She involuntarily (and hilariously) reacts like a regular teen girl when shown a video of British boy band Union J which actually is part of the real world.Then everything reverts to form and a cascade of vomit (and worse) adds to the tide of blood that flows like an evil river through Kick-Ass 2. Can we really blame Jim Carrey for having second thoughts about this?The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Director Jeff Wadlow (147). R Language violence sexuality. Area theaters. Since ""Kick-Ass 2"" is the final superhero movie of the summer a sigh of relief should be savored. Unfortunately this amped-up adolescent dreamscape of violence sends the costumed-freak season out on a super-juvenile note. The films heroes have no powers but that doesnt help make this comedy-action flick any more bearable. Juvenile power of course is the whole point of ""Kick-Ass 2"" -- in which like the first ""Kick-Ass"" from 2010 the wit begins and ends with the title. Here high school bad-guy-basher Mindy Macready (Chloe Grace Moretz) has perfected her abilities as New York crime fighter Hit-Girl skipping ninth-grade classes to hone her skills. But Kick-Ass aka Dave Lizewski (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is worried about donning his green-and-yellow jumpsuit after his exploits kick off a wave of vigilante imitators. Dave pushes Mindy to become a team which she resists. Meanwhile Chris DAmico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) the spoiled rich kid formerly known as Red Mist reinvents himself as a villain called the Motherf---er. He and his team of psychos -- they look like rejects from the Halloween parade or a Comic-Con brain trust -- set out to destroy Kick-Ass. So Kick-Ass joins his own oddball group called Justice Forever led by an ex-Mafia enforcer-turned born-again Christian named Colonel Stars and Stripes (Jim Carrey). They all face off in a massive battle in a warehouse. Carreys Long Island-accented toughie is a pleasant diversion in ""Kick-Ass 2."" Hes smirky dangerous and looks like hes been through hell. Carrey -- who hasnt publicized the movie since he changed his mind on its free-flowing bloodshed -- coils his energy up like a grenade. Clark Duke as Daves pal adds another grace note and a giant villainess called Mother Russia goofily looks like Dolph Lundgren in drag. Mintz-Plasse though is annoying as usual and the made-by-and-for-fanboys feel is irksome to non-Marvel purebloods. Moretz a consistently intriguing young actress does a lot with Mindys journey while Taylor-Johnson a dull actor has the geek thing down. But the movie is full of itself and head-crushingly repetitive pose sling snark punch and stab in slow-mo. Repeat. The meta-satire hits you over the head until not just your Spidey sense is tingling.

Through that point it was all fun and games whenever someone got hurt -- not just ""until"" -- but then mob boss Frank DAmico (Mark Strong) beats on the 11-year-old just as a grown man would. Her endless supplies of ammunition and remarkable gymnastic prowess are of no use now. I could never reconcile the hypocrisy of that moment this girls untouchable so long as its cool to watch but very vulnerable indeed once the tables are turned followed by an absurd gesture of heroism that acts as a wish-fulfillment capper on a story that otherwise ostensibly condemned the insane behavior that our heroes would engage in. During Jeff Wadlows ""Kick-Ass 2"" characters go so far as to repeatedly insist that ""this isnt a comic book This is real life"" Right the real life with the bazookas and jet-packs and pet sharks and man-sized microwaves. That lip service to consequence only draws attention to the fact that this sequel is an even more pronounced cartoon that nonetheless maintains the first films habit of mocking comic conventions while rarely subverting them. In keeping with the film weve already devoted more attention to Hit-Girl than our actual protagonist Dave Lizewski (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) a New York high-schooler itching to get back in the habit of clandestine crime-fighting just as Hit-Girl (a.k.a. Mindy Macready) is trying to leave that life behind following the passing of her father (Nicolas Cage). They part ways and each lands in a suitable clique; Mindy takes up with a crew of ""Heathers""/""Mean Girls""-types led by Brooke (Claudia Lee) and gives ""being a normal teenage girl"" a try while Dave seeks out fellow do-gooders and finds himself recruited by Colonel Stars and Stripes (an unrecognizable Jim Carrey) leader of the superhero team Justice Forever. That leaves friend-turned-foe Chris DAmico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) a rich kid with a bad temper whos gone from being Red Mist to strutting around town in Samp;M gear as the Motherfker on a campaign to take out Kick-Ass Hit-Girl and anyone else who stands in his way. While admitting that Wadlow has improved on previous films ""Never Back Down"" and ""Cry_Wolf"" may not be saying much the writer-director does a commendable job of matching Vaughns profane swagger in terms of tone although the action scenes lack Vaughns more distinctive punctuation and occasionally seem hindered by a reduced budget especially during a highway-set rescue sequence. Theres even something particularly crass about watching an ex-KGB henchwoman by the name of Mother Russia (Olga Kurkulina) take out NYPD officers two by two in a parade of elaborate executions. Then again lets not pretend that good taste was the name of the game the first time around. When compared to the now-tarnished novelty of a pint-sized killer of men ""KA2"" eagerly seeks to lower the bar with gags involving homophobia threats of rape accusations of statutory rape and a most unfortunate symphony of two-way bodily excretion. But hey That rape bit ends with a limp-dick joke And when the Motherfker assigns a series of racist monikers to his lackeys his right hand man (John Leguizamo) points out that theyre all stereotypes. ""No Theyre archetypes"" Chris insists just as the film repeatedly offers its own half-hearted excuses for such a juvenile campaign of offensiveness. It doesnt help that Taylor-Johnson continues to out-bland Tobey Maguire as a kid trying to do the right thing or that Moretz still acts circles around him as Mindy goes through the paces of her own coming-of-age mini-movie balancing volatility and vulnerability with a preternatural ease. As the closest thing to a Cage surrogate around Carreys clearly having a good time and if anything one would have welcomed more of his born-again patriot cracking skulls and grins with equal fervor. However at the end of the day this is a sequel that is faithful to the superficial thrills and flaws of the original. Its the type of movie that proudly trash-talks Batman and Robin while plainly aping the arcs of Peter Parker and Harry Osborn. Despite the cries of real-world consequence ""Kick-Ass 2"" isnt above the usual hero-no-more speeches and second-act calls to action; they just happen to involve more f-bombs than pumpkin bombs.

By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Aug 15 2013 952 AM ""Kick-Ass"" the 2010 movie that poked holes in the superhero genre was insanely violent profane and over the top. Naturally I took my mother who was 81 to see it. It says something about the amount of heart Matthew Vaughns film had that it was probably her favorite movie of the year. ""Kick-Ass 2"" also is insanely violent and profane but not nearly as fun. Is it simply a matter of the bloom being off the rose? That the originality of an 11-year-old girl cursing like a sailor before literally cutting off a bad guy at the knees isnt as ... well whatever it isnt when shes a 15-year-old? Thats doubtless part of it. Jeff Wadlows taking over as director changes up things too. But ""Kick-Ass 2"" has a mean-spirited vigilante streak the first film lacked (it seemed more concerned with justice in its way) as well as a fatigue. Its still funny particularly when Hit Girl (Chloe Grace Moretz) spews profanity and wields weapons. Its just not as good. In the years since the first movie the crime-fighting exploits of Dave (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) better known as Kick-Ass the teenage superhero have gone viral. This has inspired legions of people to don costumes and do good deeds. Dave is a senior in high school while Mindy Hit-Girls real identity is a freshman. Dave still likes the crime-fighting life. Mindy lives for it but since the death of her father shes living with his former police partner (Morris Chestnut) who makes her promise shell hang up the costume and mask (and nunchuks and daggers and guns). Instead she now must work her way through something equally as daunting -- if not more so -- as crime fighting being a teenage girl. While she works her way through that jungle of backbiting drama Dave joins an outfit called Justice Forever led by an ex-mobster calling himself Colonel Stars and Stripes (Jim Carrey who denounced the films violence and has declined to promote it). Mostly they do charitable deeds such as serve meals at the soup kitchen. But they also patrol looking for crime. And eventually they find it. Thats because Chris DAmico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) known as the Red Mist in the last movie is out for revenge. Kick-Ass killed his mob-boss father. Now hes rechristened himself as ... well something unrepeatable here. Hes wearing his late moms bondage gear and hiring the baddest criminals in town looking for Kick-Ass head. A showdown approaches. As you might have guessed. There is a grittier feel to this film one thats more uncomfortable to watch than the first one. That movie while a poke in the eye (or other places) to comics never forgot that it was a comic. It was more stylized and it must be said much more original. Thats not to say that there arent some laughs. As long as Hit-Girl is around even when shes trying out for the dance squad therell be plenty of humor. Its just not as guilt-free this time around. ""Kick-Ass 2"" isnt bad as sequels go but unlike the first movie it never quite kicks ass. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

"Kick-Ass 2 (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Kick-Ass 2 (R) This sequel to the subversive 2010 comic-book superhero movie is conveyor-belt filmmaking. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com8/15/2013 Editor rating 2 At one point in Kick-Ass 2 the teenaged Dave Lizewski (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) the self-made superhero from the subversive 2010 original film wears a T-shirt that reads ""I hate reboots."" The shirt gets a huge laugh from the audience. But you know what I hate? Lame leaden sequels to fun vibrant movies. What seemed edgy and bold in Kick-Ass is now routine and old-hat. The first movie was a brash satire on formulaic comic-book movies -- exactly the sort of picture the sequel turns out to be. Writer-director Jeff Wadlow (Never Back Down) taking over the reins from Matthew Vaughn (who only served as producer this time) has made a movie that manages to meld the worst elements of Joel Schumachers Batman amp; Robin with Paul Greengrass epileptic-cam from the Jason Bourne movies. The action sequences in Kick-Ass 2 consist of lots of handheld shaky camera work. But that sense of gritty realism keeps the movie from being fun When a roided-out Russian female bodybuilder kills 10 police officers outside a home where a woman is being assaulted the film becomes a major downer. And when a group of superheroes rushes in to fight a pack of supervillains all the cheesy costumes and gaudy colors make the whole thing look cheap and dumb like a Halloween costume party where the drunken revelers started whaling away at each other. The plot of Kick-Ass 2 which is taken from Mark Millars comic feels like something that was written solely to cash in on the first films success. The villainous Red Mist (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) who vowed to avenge the death of his gangster father in the first film kills his mother early in the movie comes across some leather Samp;M garb hidden in her closet and rechristens himself with a name that cannot be repeated here. Claiming wealth as his superpower he buys himself a roster of ex-convicts and murderers to take down Kick-Ass and his newly-formed gang of superheroes which includes an unrecognizable Jim Carrey as an ex-mob enforcer turned born-again vigilante who calls himself Col. Stars and Stripes. Carrey has distanced himself from the movie and spoke out against it in June stating that he couldnt promote it in good conscience after the Sandy Hook shootings. But the movie is so cartoonish and ridiculous the actors stance seems like an overreaction. Practically no one in Kick-Ass 2 looks like they want to be there. Taylor-Johnson a British actor who made for an endearing American kid in the first film looks much too old for the part this time and his attempt to make his voice sound younger is noticeable to point of distraction. Mintz-Plasse gives the first all-out bad performance of his career turning his demented character into a grating insufferable brat. The only person to come away from the movie unscathed is Chloe Grace Moretz whose performance as the 13-year-old Hit Girl in the first film was the focal point of most of the controversy that surrounded it. Now 15 she still spouts bad words and kills bad guys but her behavior isnt quite as shocking. The actress even gets her own subplot recounting her attempts to fit in at high school and the mean girls standing in her way. The outrageous resolution of that conflict feels like a warm-up to her lead performance in the Carrie remake due this fall. But even that scene falls flat resorting to gross-out gags and CGI-diarrhea an indication of the level of wit at work here. Kick-Ass 2 isnt irritatingly bad or torturous to sit through. But it never shakes the feeling that the filmmakers were trying too hard to live up to the first movie in all the wrong ways.

Photo Everett Collection I do get a chuckle out of movies with wildly inappropriate behavior rude language and ultramayhem especially when they involve children but ""Kick-Ass 2"" sometimes felt like being trapped in a room with the funniest guy in seventh grade. As in the superior 2010 original ""KA2"" sets out on a cheeky mission to do everything pretty much the opposite of a Spider-Man movie. Nerdy teen Dave (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) tried to train himself to be a vigilante superhero called Kick-Ass with largely comical results only to join forces with a sweet little girl named Mindy (Chloe Grace Moretz) who had with the help of her cop father actually succeeded in turning herself into a lethal fighting machine called Hit Girl. Hit Girl made her unforgettable entrance in a room full of soon-to-die bad guys behind the line ""All right you c - - ts lets see what you can do now"" She has a go at topping that zinger a couple of times in the sequel. She doesnt quite succeed because a joke isnt as funny the second time around and maybe especially not if you shout it. This movie screams ""Look at how naughty we are"" at every opportunity. Example A sworn enemy (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) whose father was killed by Kick-Ass. Now he prefers to be addressed as supervillain ""The Motherf - - ker."" He wears a black patent leather set of Samp;M gear that he found in his mothers belongings after he accidentally fried her to death in her tanning bed. Be forewarned that there is a fairly amazing display of violence most of it involving youngsters. Twenty-five years ago a film like this would have inspired sober op-eds and congressional hearings. Today we realize the fall of the Republic is not going to ensue but that doesnt mean the movies frantic lunges at the inappropriate dont become tiresome at times. And for all the arterial spray on-screen I never got the sense that there was a beating heart to the movie. Kick-Ass himself is kind of a bore especially compared to Hit Girl and she spends too much of the movie renouncing her superhero identity to please her guardian (Morris Chestnut) while getting caught up with trying to be popular with a high school clique of neo-Heathers. This collision of styles leads to a gross-out scene that is more vivid than funny. RELATED STARS THAT DISS THEIR OWN FILMS (AND GET PAID MILLIONS) Jim Carrey or at least a version of him is also on hand to liven things up as a former mobster in military gear now calling himself Col. Stars and Stripes. Carrey underneath a mound of makeup plays it straight as a gravelly voiced killer but why go with faux Mickey Rourke when the real one is still around? (Also Rourke wouldnt have wussed out and denounced his own movie pre-release as Carrey has done.) ""KA2"" written and directed by the little-known Jeff Wadlow taking over for Matthew Vaughn is less grounded than the delightful original more hectic and blaring -- a cinematic shock jock who needs to push your buttons. Id rather watch it again than revisit any of those dully earnest Spidey epics but I did wish the wit could have been as consistently sharp as the many instruments of bloodletting.

August 15 2013 -- 301pm Video (0729)  The sequel to Kick-Ass fails to deliver the wit and timing that carried the original film. Star Tribune Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert Theres a throwaway gag halfway through ""Kick-Ass 2"" that got a rare laugh from the fanboys and -girls in the audience. Our hero Dave Lizewski (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) a high school comic-book nerd and masked after-school crime fighter pops up in a T-shirt proclaiming ""I Hate Reboots."" It would have been more self-aware if the slogan was ""I Hate Sequels."" This follow-up film bungles the original cult hits stylized ultraviolence and blunts its wincingly sharp humor. The first ""Kick-Ass"" made a joke of the idea that vigilantes could turn street justice into blood sport and emerge with their souls unscathed. Matthew Vaughn (""X-Men First Class"") who co-wrote produced and directed the original laid out the yarn with a storytellers gift lampooning our most horrendous revenge fantasies. He rendered the pulp material in hyperbolic style. The new film written and directed by graceless journeyman filmmaker Jeff Wadlow mistakenly believes that crotch kicks and wisecracks are uproarious all on their own. Without Vaughns porno-Dadaist wit ""Kick-Ass 2"" is a sick joke minus the joke. Jim Carrey publicly announced that he is so turned off by the new movie that he regrets co-starring in it and refuses to promote it. The main story comes straight from the Action Movie Plot Generator. Dave a k a Kick-Ass; his foulmouthed partner in beat-em-up Mindy Macready/Hit Girl (Chloe Grace Moretz) and their sidekick-turned-nemesis Chris DAmico/Red Mist (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) return more or less where we left them three years ago. Except that Chris the orphan of a crime boss eliminated by Kick-Ass now lives in palatial splendor as the wealthiest teenager in New York. (With great power comes tax breaks.) Donning his late mothers vinyl Samp;M regalia as his new costume Chris vows to ""kill Kick-Ass with my bare hands"" a tall order when youre a wormy little nebbish. Delegating the rough stuff (""My superpower is that Im rich"") Chris hires a multicultural goon squad christening his henchmen with monikers like Black Death and Genghis Carnage. When his right-hand man (John Leguizamo) chastises him for trading in racial stereotypes Chris snaps ""Archetypes"" All insecurity false bravado and childish rage Mintz-Plasse delivers the only sparky performance in the film. Elsewhere Mindy confronts high school mean girls more nefarious than any supervillain. Armed with sarcasm eye rolls and the silent treatment they try to turn the fearless tomboy into a dainty devious facsimile of themselves. At a sleepover they brainwash her with a music video from the Brit boy band Union J. This could have led to a fully fleshed subplot with the fashion squad adopting Hit Girl. I would have liked to see them teaching her how to wear her demi-cape draped off one shoulder with just a sassy touch of confident playfulness but it was not to be. Mindys eventual retaliation against the catty clique with a stomach-scrambling ""sick stick"" proves that you can be more explicit about gastric distress than ""Bridesmaids"" without being half as funny. Universal Studios Chloe Grace Moretz returns as Hit Girl in ""Kick-Ass 2."" Meanwhile Dave resists his crush on the nubile underage Mindy and teams up with a ragtag heroes league. Their leader is Col. Stars and Stripes (Carrey) a thug turned born-again Christian who enforces law and order with a red white and blue ax handle and a German shepherd attack dog named Eisenhower. With his buzz cut camo costume and he-man stubble the big palooka resembles Sgt. Rock gone to seed. The dated insight here is that the line between pro bono public guardian and lunatic vigilante is near-invisible. All these costumed weirdos share an insatiable hunger for retribution garnished with righteous wrath simmered with a hint of bloodlust and arranged on a bed of revenge served cold. What ""Kick-Ass 2"" delivers is stale unappetizing and slathered in too much red sauce. Colin Covert has covered films for the Star Tribune for 20 years interviewing Peter Jackson Kate Winslet Steven Spielberg Cate Blanchett Quentin Tarantino Neil Gaiman and John Travolta to name a few. Colins job as a film critic consists mostly of thinking up synonyms for ""mediocre."" He still gets a thrill when the lights dim and all too often a bigger thrill when they come on again.

Superhero spoof Kick-Ass 2 lacks the punch of the original By Joe Williams joewilliamspost-dispatch.com 314-340-8344 Joe Williams Aug 15 2013 (...) Jody Mitori Jim Carrey (left) and Aaron Taylor-Johnson in ""Kick-Ass 2."" To paraphrase pulp director Russ Meyer a tween girl who can fight like a ninja and swear like a sailor could rule the world. But like a Mouseketeer or a Russian gymnast after she reaches puberty shes just another annoying teenager. That in a nutshell is the problem with ""Kick-Ass 2"" a superhero satire that might have seemed fresh and ferocious were it not for the original ""Kick-Ass.""In that 2010 adaptation of the comic-book series Chloe Moretz as a very young vigilante called Hit Girl effectively stole the movie from its star Aaron Johnson as a self-styled superhero called Kick-Ass. British actor Johnson (now billed as Aaron Taylor-Johnson) was actually quite believable as an ordinary New York teen who built himself into a fighting machine. But Moretz whose character Mindy was hardened for urban battle by her rogue-cop father (Nicolas Cage) was a precocious pleasure. And the movie was written and directed by up-and-coming action auteur Matthew Vaughn (""Layer Cake"").With the planets aligned ""Kick-Ass"" detonated them. It was both shockingly violent and sardonically funny. This sequel is violent and funny too but with the maturation of Moretz and the vacation of Vaughn its like the difference between lightning and a lightning bug. Three years after his Internet videos inspired a city full of copycat crime-fighters Kick-Ass aka Dave Lizewski is itching for action again. But Mindy is now living with a cop stepfather (Morris Chestnut) who forbids her to play rough and steers her to the hive of the high schools queen bee (Claudia Lee). So Kick-Ass joins a new group of ill-prepared part-time vigilantes called Justice Forever led by a psychotic Mafioso-turned-Christian called Col. Stars and Stripes (Jim Carrey).Trouble comes calling in the person of Chris DAmico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) a former superhero sidekick whose mobster father was killed by Kick-Ass. Changing his persona from Red Mist to ahem the M.F. Chris buys himself a posse of super villains to destroy everything that Kick-Ass loves. Of course the blood feud culminates in a battle royale which new director Jeff Wadlow (""Never Back Down"") handles with over-edited dexterity. Eyes are gouged limbs are hacked and a henchman is forced to eat his own privates. (Unlike a projectile-vomit scene in the school cafeteria the self-cannibalizing scene happens off camera.) Yet despite what co-star Carrey has said in disowning the movie the effect is not so much shocking as stupefying. To stand out in a crowded marketplace a sequel cant just kick ass -- it has to blow minds.What ""Kick-Ass 2""  Two stars out of four  Rating R  Run time 143  Content Pervasive bloody violence crude language and brief nudity Joe Williams (joethecritic) is the Post-Dispatch film critic and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

"Kick-Ass 2 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; kick-ass-2 ) Kick-Ass 2 (United States/United Kingdom 2013) August 15 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli The summer blockbuster season of 2013 is over so what do we get as we move into the dog days of August? Yet another superhero movie. If there was ever any question about their ubiquitous multiplex presence this answers it. A sequel to the breath-of-fresh-air 2010 action/comedy Kick-Ass this film tries to do what many second installments attempt - now that the origin story has been dispensed with take the characters in new directions. That usually means bigger fights more interesting plot developments and a stronger payoff. However since Kick-Ass was such an atypical superhero production the filmmakers with Jeff Wadlow (whose previous effort was the forgettable Never Back Down) taking over for Matthew Vaughn in the directors chair appear to be in a quandary about how to proceed. And while there are some solid gold moments the story as a whole has an unfocused meandering quality and there are elements that simply dont work. Plus the movies need to include so-called ""meta"" elements (comparing the ""real world"" with the world of comic books) feel forced and obligatory. And there are instances when the irony is laid on so thickly that the only thing missing is a blinking neon sign with an arrow. Kick-Ass 2 starts at an unspecified time after Kick-Ass (but its about 3 years). By now the first ""real"" superhero Dave Lizewski a.k.a. Kick-Ass (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) has returned to a normal high school life. The same cannot be said of Mindy Macready (Chloe Grace Moretz) who continues to moonlight as Hit Girl helping to keep the streets of Manhattan crime-free. She has plenty of help from other masked vigilantes like Dr. Gravity (Donald Faison) and Night Bitch (Lindy Booth). Her guardian Detective Marcus Williams (Morris Chestnut) believes she has given up her life of crime-fighting to become a model student. Meanwhile Chris DAmico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) the former Red Mist nurses his grudge against Kick-Ass to the point where it poisons everything in his life. His obsession to kill the man responsible for his fathers death causes him to become the worlds first ""super villain."" Spending the millions of dollars of inheritance money he recruits an army of psychopaths and misfits led by the frightening Mother Russia (Olga Kurkulina). Bored of doing regular high school senior things Dave decides he wants to resurrect his alter-ego but he realizes Kick-Ass needs a partner so he seeks out Mindy. Although initially reluctant she eventually agrees to train him and they have a short-lived partnership (with romantic overtones). Once Mindy is forced out of the superhero business by Marcus Dave seeks out others and joins a group of unlikely Avengers led by Colonel Stars and Stripes (Jim Carrey). The team however is destined for a short and unpleasant life as Chris who now calls himself The Motherfucker targets them for elimination. Probably the most controversial aspect of Kick-Ass 2 will be the dark dark territory into which it ventures. Using The Dark Knight as a template it puts characters and viewers alike through a wringer. The first Kick-Ass raised some eyebrows with its extreme violence (especially where Hit Girl was concerned); Kick-Ass 2 dials back nothing but this time some of what it does feels cruel and sadistic. For a movie being marketed as an ""action/comedy"" the tonal shift is shocking. Theres nothing comedic about the places where the storyline takes us and an endeavor to turn an attempted rape into a joke is about as ghastly a misfire as one can envision. While the first half of Kick-Ass 2 stays mostly true to its predecessors feel the second half abandons almost all attempts at humor in favor of something that would be considered grueling for even an uber-serious superhero outing. Tone isnt the movies sole problem. Theres something off-putting about Christopher Mitz-Plasse as the chief bad guy. The actor is so over-the-top (wearing an Samp;M fetish costume) that its impossible to take him seriously. He makes Al Pacino in Scarface seem restrained and under control. Yet his actions of mayhem murder and brutality are so stark that it creates a disconnect. Mintz-Plasse is trying to do his version of The Joker and it never comes close to working. His henchmen especially the seemingly indestructible Mother Russia are a lot more interesting. Thats why the least interesting aspect of the finale is learning The Motherfuckers fate. To be fair there are elements of Kick-Ass 2 that work exceptionally well. Although Dave isnt the most interesting of leads the filmmakers recognize this and give significantly greater exposure to the much more interesting Mindy. Despite a pointlessly graphic ending to an otherwise engaging side-story the trajectory of her character is effectively delineated. Mindy (and by extension the actress who plays her Chloe Grace Moretz) is Kick-Ass 2s greatest asset. The final battle is also undeniably satisfying in a visceral way. It doesnt redeem the movies missteps but it mutes them. The ending a Dark Knight/Iron Man pastiche hints that if the box office warrants it there could be a Kick-Ass 3. Whatever its faults Kick-Ass 2 at least dares to be different. The R rating should limit some of the most vociferous criticism associated with the non-stop brutality - this isnt intended for kids nor should it be seen by them. Some of the things done by Wadlow and company keep the movie from becoming repetitive. Still theres a sense that a better-focused more grounded approach would have resulted in a stronger film. After all elements of Kick-Ass 2 hint at the promise of something more interesting. One of the key aspects of Kick-Ass was the lampooning of superhero tropes; Kick-Ass 2 has largely abandoned this segment of its DNA and instead bought into them. Kick-Ass 2s desire to abandon the ""parody"" label and move in the direction of becoming an actual card-carrying superhero adventure edges the saga closer to Watchmen territory. By abandoning so much of what made Kick-Ass memorable Kick-Ass 2 has devalued the nascent franchise and left vaguely unpleasant aftertaste.

"Kick-Ass 2 movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Jim Carreys mea culpa a good first step for Kick-Ass 2  1/2 Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune ""Kick-Ass 2"" the sequel to the 2010 adaptation of Scottish comic book author Mark Millars ""Kick-Ass"" comes in right on the bubble Its no better no worse and essentially no different from the jocular clodhopping brutality of the first one. Here in writer-director Jeff Wadlows crimson bauble Chloe Grace Moretz and Aaron Taylor-Johnson reprise their roles as Hit Girl and Kick-Ass respectively -- the homegrown limb-lopping superheroes and high school classmates (hes older but shes tougher) who spill more blood than a klutzy production assistant on a Tarantino shoot.Jim Carrey plays a supporting role in ""Kick-Ass 2"" that of Colonel Stars and Stripes a born-again Christian and former mobster who leads a pack of alleged good-guy and good-girl masked vigilantes cleaning up the streets. After filming the sequel but before its release Carrey disassociated himself tweeting ""In all good conscience I cannot support that level of violence."" He cited the most recent example of an American school massacre Sandy Hook as the tragedy that ""caused a change in my heart."" Then came the counterarguments from Carreys ""Kick-Ass 2"" collaborators including Moretz. She presumably has a percentage of the sequels profits and sound business reasons to object.""Its a movie and its fake"" she said ""and Ive known that since I was a kid ... if anything these movies teach you what not to do."" Separately Millar who executive-produced the sequel chimed in with his fiscal gratitude ""For your main actor to publicly say This movie is too violent for me is like saying This porno has too much nudity."" Moretzs comment was the oddest the one about how ""Kick-Ass 2"" instructs us in the costs of all that quippy bloodthirsty street justice. Honestly now. These movies do not teach anybody anything about avoiding the kick-assery. Worse director Wadlows fight sequences satisfy none of my action-movie requirements for clarity and excitement. They dont even satisfy my cheapest revenge impulses.The sequel sets up one round of heinousness after another and the audience waits for the money shots. When the meanest girls in high school bully Mindy aka Hit Girl (the bullying here is constant and hammering) she pulls out her late fathers ""sick stick"" which causes instantaneous and simultaneous projectile-vomiting and projectile-diarrhea and that is meant to be really sick as in cool.So is the scene of attempted rape played for laughs and focusing on Christopher Mintz-Plasses self-made supervillain who tries but fails to assault the vigilante (Lindy Booth) who calls herself ""Night Bitch."" (Honestly this movie is rank.) I can only imagine how this scene will play to the assault victims in the audience especially when Booths character hospitalized though apparently unviolated says ""Its my own fault."" I want to be believe Carreys 11th-hour apology. Clearly he read the script (his characters dog bites off the genitals of his adversaries) and he may have done a quick body count in his head while reading. But its not the quantity of the carnage in a movie its the quality and as staged and filmed ""Kick-Ass 2"" is a cruddy mediocrity. Near the end Moretzs character says she must leave New York City and hide out because ""vigilantes dont get a free pass."" Its the best joke in the movie; in terms of its own hypocritical morality ""Kick-Ass 2"" hands out free passes left and right.mjphillipstribune.com ""Kick-Ass 2"" - 1 1/2 starsMPAA rating R (for strong violence pervasive language crude and sexual content and brief nudity)Running time 147Opens Thursday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Action (Movie Genre) Kick-Ass 2 (movie) Jim Carrey Entertainment Chloe Grace Moretz Movies Kick-Ass (movie) Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising72deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0813-kick-ass-2-20130815,0,1967109.column",200,kick-ass224,kick-ass2,chicagotribune

Universal Pictures For many viewers Matthew Vaughns 2010 adaptation of Mark Millars aspirant teen superhero comic book Kick-Ass was a kind of litmus test for nihilism. Crossing grotesque violence with broad goofy humor and a corrosive journey of moral damnation with a standard-issue coming-of-age tale it seemed like the last word in ironic cynicism. Still if you could accept its unholy crossing of the pop-culture streams Kick-Ass worked as a kind of mad teen opera -- taking you to some truly dark places in a way that the average superhero flick never dared. A Of course that was before the massacres in Tucson and Aurora and Newtown. But it was not before the massacres in Columbine Virginia Tech and elsewhere; Kick-Ass 2 isnt being released into a culture any more or less violent than the one that received the first Kick-Ass. But it is a culture that for some good reasons is more sensitive about such things. This apprehension has reached all the way to one of the stars of the new film -- Jim Carrey who post-Newtown has decided not to promote it. I dont know why I mention this. Other than perhaps as a kind of touchstone for coming to terms with my own response to Kick-Ass 2 a movie that for all its predictable sequel-ness manages to conjure up pretty much the same dark magic that the earlier film did albeit with more troubling results. Believe it or not Kick-Ass 2 is even more of a provocation than the first Kick-Ass. It knows it too. The new movie opens on a young girl pointing a giant gun This is 15-year-old Mindy Macready a.k.a. Hit Girl (Chloe Grace-Moretz) who with our hero Dave Lizewski a.k.a. Kick-Ass (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is testing out a new bulletproof vest. She shoots him and he falls back -- stunned but alive thanks to the vest. Then she tries to shoot him again. Having had enough he yells ""Dont Not cool."" ""Okay"" she replies and then as hes walking away cavalierly shoots him in the back and giggles. The scene is pretty much a warning shot across the brows of anyone getting ready to tut-tutA  the spectacle of kids with guns cracking jokes. The words ""YOU MIGHT AS WELL LEAVE NOW"" flashing across the screen would be less blunt. A But that scene is hardly the most disturbing thing here which ups both the scarring violence and the devil-may-care attitude towards it from the original. In the new film Kick-Ass the teen hero has now inspired waves of imitators. The streets are inundated with costumed characters of varying levels of competence. Kick-Ass himself wasnt a particularly good hero; that honor belonged to Hit-Girl who had been trained from a very young age by her rogue mad ex-cop father Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) who died a horrific death near the end of the first film. Hit-Girl is foul-mouthed fast and lethal. But shes now also a teenage girl and in an effort to better fit in at school she attempts to give up crime fighting try out for the cheerleading squad and befriend a Heathers-like clique of rich mean girls. That leaves Dave alone so he finds his own team to join A collective of superhero-wannabes who call themselves Justice Forever led by The Colonel (Carrey) a mob enforcer turned crime-fighting do-gooder. Kick-Ass even begins to fall for one of them a young lady who calls herself Night Bitch (Lindy Booth). Also out there however is Chris DAmico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) an impressionable rich nerd who in the first film also wanted to be a superhero named Red Mist. Unfortunately his father happened to be the ruthless head of a gangland empire and was killed by Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl. (Dads dont last long in the Kick-Ass universe.) Chris now wants to be a supervillain and after accidentally frying his mom on her tanning bed (okay fine no parent lasts long in the Kick-Ass universe) and inheriting all the family money assembles his own team of deranged mercenaries. He calls himself the Mother Fucker. ""My superpower is that Im rich as fuck"" he bellows. The first Kick-Ass worked in part because of the energy and cartoonish visual grace director Vaughn brought to it For all ones objections it was hard not to get swept up in the cascading insanity of the whole thing. Vaughn is producing this time with Cry_Wolfs Jeff Wadlow directing and while Kick-Ass 2 does a decent job of replicating the look and feel of the original (as well as that of the Millar comics) it doesnt have the same urgency. In the first film the tension was between a hapless kid who got caught up in the murderous antics of a serious and seriously violent criminal enterprise. Now because the bad guy is the thoroughly evil yet ridiculous Mother Fucker its hard to build much drama. So the film replaces all that with even more ridiculous violence. Various characters are castrated by a dog that leaps at their crotches whenever someone yells ""Schwantz"" Two cops are killed by a lawnmower thats backed into their car. Others merely get beheaded. Theres also an attempted rape thats played for laughs when the bad guy cant get an erection -- a tough scene to watch even for those of us generally able to go with the Kick-Ass films ethos. Its the kind of boundary-crossing that threatens to sink the whole enterprise. Is it worse than the spectacle of entire cities being leveled in other action movies? No probably not. But to quote that greatest of script doctors Joseph Stalin ""One death is a tragedy a million deaths is a revenue-generating four-quadrant PG-13 summer tentpole."" Perhaps to offset all that ghastliness Kick-Ass 2 also furthers an empowerment narrative ""I never made varsity football. I never got cast in the school play. But if I had it would have felt like this"" a character says of joining Justice Forever which is made up of outcasts and victims. (One of them is a young gay kid whos tired of getting beaten up. Also there is a middle-aged couple out to avenge their abducted son.) And after her disillusionment with the popular girls at school Mindy realizes that her crime-fighting alter ego is that of a strong and independent woman who cant be bullied by anybody. The film wants to take this kind of empowerment seriously - to find some light inside this pitch-black world - but such moral clarity isnt really within its field of vision. Its an uncertainty echoed by the characters themselves ""Maybe thats the real meaning of being a superhero Taking that pain and making something good out of it"" Hit-Girl says to Kick-Ass at one point somewhat awkwardly and half-heartedly. ""Now help me find some wire"" she then adds perking up. ""Im going to make this guy eat his own dick.""

"Movie review Kick-Ass 2 aims high but falls short - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Movie review Kick-Ass 2 aims high but falls short Kick-Ass 2 Daniel Smith / Universal Jim Carrey left and Aaron Taylor-Johnson star in ""Kick-Ass 2."" Jim Carrey left and Aaron Taylor-Johnson star in ""Kick-Ass 2."" (Daniel Smith / Universal) Mark Olsen As this years cycle of summertime movie-time disaster and destruction winds down the time seems ripe for a film to ponder just what we want from all those superhero fantasies and exaggerated adventures. ""Kick-Ass 2"" would like to be that movie but its not.Just as the characters in the film are average people running around in homemade costumes calling themselves super ""Kick-Ass 2"" is a lesser version of what it appears to be an uncertain jumble rather than a true exploration of outrage violence and identity. PHOTOS Kick-Ass 2 and a Comic-Con presentationBoth the original comic and 2010 film ""Kick-Ass"" reveled in provocations best exemplified not by the bland title character -- a teenage boy masquerading as a costumed crime fighter -- but rather the astonishing creation of the foul-mouthed pre-adolescent dervish of pain and punishment known as Hit-Girl. The comic ""Kick-Ass 2"" is a lean unpleasant piece of work with a slight straightforward tale of blood and revenge so Jeff Wadlow in taking over duties as writer-director from Matthew Vaughn had to expand on the story. High schooler Dave Lizewski (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is desperate to get back in action as his alter-ego Kick-Ass while the now teenage Mindy Macready (Chloe Grace Moretz) is struggling to maintain a promise that she no longer adopt the persona of Hit-Girl. Chris DAmico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) is leaving behind his identity as superhero Red Mist to assume the mantle of the worlds first super-villain with a new name unprintable here.As in the first film Moretz and her character of Hit-Girl largely overwhelm the rest of the film. Wadlows main addition to the story is expanding the attention given to the adventures of Mindy in the land of other young women grappling with other peoples ideas of normal. Among the films best moments is when young Mindy trying to fit in sees a boy-band video for the first time unleashing a wave of hormonal responses that Moretz captures perfectly.SPECIAL REPORT The culture of violence in entertainmentThe adventures of Hit-Girl as a regular person are far more compelling than those of Kick-Ass as a superhero. (Though even her story line is marred by a cheap unnecessary joke in which a mean girl is made to evacuate her body from both ends at once.) As in the first film it also doesnt help that as a performer Taylor-Johnson is a charisma-free zone. Wadlow also expands slightly the role of amateur superhero Colonel Stars and Stripes played by Jim Carrey. The increasingly un-fun actor is a rather poor substitute for the madcap performance of Nicolas Cage in the first film as Hit-Girls father. Carrey recently declared he would not be promoting ""Kick-Ass 2"" due to a crisis of conscience regarding the films violence. Not to be overly cynical about this change of heart but Carrey got more notice for himself and the film by not participating.Anyway he neednt have worried. The sequels violence feels soft-pedaled compared with the first film continually shying away from being too graphic and with little of the gleeful revelry that give the first ""Kick-Ass"" its energy and punch. That internal tension -- reaching for outrage but hesitantly pulling back -- culminates in Wadlows handling of the comics notorious rape scene. (And the comics writer Mark Millar recently sparked controversy with comments on his repeated use of rape as a storytelling device.)Wadlow switches the character who gets attacked from Kick-Ass high school-age girlfriend to the adult female character known as Night Bitch. Wadlow also attempts to diffuse the scene with humor by having Mintz-Plasses character unable to er perform. Transforming a rape scene into a sex joke makes an ugly moment into a tacky one and would seem the definition of not getting it.The entire film feels like something of a cop-out a soft shrug rather than a hard slap. When a character says something racist or hateful another will comment on how racist or hateful it is trying to have it both ways. As the story goes on there are increasing references to the distinction between real life and comic books and a couple mentions that life does not have sequels. In adapting ""Kick-Ass 2"" it is as if Wadlow got trapped within fanboy cultures self-referring hall-of-mirrors with neither a map to guide him nor a hammer sufficient enough to smash his way out of it.mark.olsenlatimes.com------------------------------Kick-Ass 2MPAA Rating Rated R for strong violence pervasive language crude and sexual content and brief nudityRunning time 1 hour 47 minutesPlaying In wide release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Entertainment Kick-Ass 2 (movie) Jim Carrey Aaron Taylor-Johnson Christopher Mintz-Plasse Kick-Ass (movie) Kick-Ass sequel is ready to give rival films the boot Kick-Ass Mark Millar knows exactly how it will all end Summer Movie Sneaks Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad83deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-kick-ass-2-20130815,0,7182428.story",200,kick-ass226,kick-ass2,latimes

To read the whole story subscribe to BostonGlobe.com KICK-ASS 2 Share Comment 1 star A witless mean-spirited sequel ""Kick-Ass 2"" has the emotional maturity of an arrested 12-year-old and the ethical compass of a turnip. Aaron Taylor-Johnson returns as the teen screw-up turned masked avenger of the title Chloe Grace Moretz is subject to icky sentimentality as Hit Girl tries to mainstream into high school and Christopher Mintz-Plasse is more obnoxious than ever as a super-villain with an unprintable name. The movie doles out the ultraviolence with an enthusiasm thats meant to be cheeky but just feels ugly and small. When a baddie kills a squadron of cops the larkish inventiveness of their deaths -- ooh that one got a lawnmower to the head -- sticks in your throat.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet About midway through Kick-Ass 2 the sequel to 2010s normal-guy-becomes-a-crime-fighter fantasy a budding archrival corners the new girlfriend of his costumed nemesis. ""Youre done banging superheroes baby"" he sneers at the terrified teen. ""Its time to see what evil dick tastes like."" That line pulled verbatim from Mark Millars Kick-Ass comic-book series tells the uninitiated everything they need to know about the franchises controversy-courting mastermind. A savvy huckster provocateur blessed with Jerry Bruckheimers blockbuster instincts and Bret Easton Ellis gift for pissing people off Millar has conquered the cape-and-cowl industry by putting ""edgy"" attention-grabbing spins on superhero mythos. This second adaptation of his flagship title pulls back a little on the showy repugnance of its source material; the unsavory scene described above for example ends with a performance-anxiety joke instead of a rape. Yet even with its edges sanded down Kick-Ass 2 is unmistakably Millaresque--a juvenile comedy of excess in which skewering adolescent power fantasies looks an awful lot like indulging in them. As before the diamond in the rough is Chloe Grace Moretz reprising the role of foul-mouthed adolescent vigilante Hit Girl. Determined to honor her fathers dying wishes the orphaned avenger hangs up her mask and blades turning to face the equally daunting obstacles of high-school. (Her rivalry with the mean girls culminates in a quintessentially Millar money shot.) Left to clean up the streets alone the titular everyhero (Aaron Taylor-Johnson bland as ever) falls in with a motley crew of fellow costumed civilians led by a born-again bruiser (Jim Carrey on movie-star duty in Nicolas Cages absence.) On the other end of the good-to-evil divide is Christopher Mintz-Plasse still hurt about the way Kick-Ass blew his mobster father up with a bazooka. Slipping into black-leather bondage gear he reinvents himself as the worlds first supervillain (""Motherfucker"") and begins assembling an army of thugs. The film cant seem to decide if his character is a joke or a genuine threat and thats a pity because there are hints of actual menace in Mintz-Plasses volcanic hissy fits. Like most second chapters in comic-book series Kick-Ass 2 is better than its predecessor though there was really no place to go but up. New writer-director Jeff Wadlow (Never Back Down) handles the jarring shifts from vulgar banter to Peter Parkerish hand-wringing to blood-spurting carnage no better than Matthew Vaughn did. The tonal schizophrenia extends to the films world which is meant to be realistic--note the references to Twitter and viral videos as well as a focus on the medical consequences of playing hero--but often feels as cartoonishly outsize as Joel Schumachers Gotham. Building to a deeply underwhelming battle royale Kick-Ass 2 stumbles every once in a while as if by accident into a poignant moment. Theres something oddly endearing for instance about the scene in which every member of the amateur Justice League runs through his or her traumatic backstory. And then theres Moretz whose character is suddenly afflicted with the inconvenient emergence of hormonal desire. The actress once again makes the most of her part--though not even Hit Girl could overcome the awfulness of Millar-approved mouthfuls like ""Im gonna go Saudi Arabia on your ass.""

"Review Kick-Ass 2 lacks the kick of the original - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Kick-Ass 2 lacks the kick of the originalBy Tony Hicksthicksbayareanewsgroup.comPosted 08/14/2013 013558 PM PDTUpdated 08/14/2013 031418 PM PDT In Theaters This Week Get showtimes watch movie trailers Jobs Lee Daniels The Butler Kick-Ass 2 The Spectacular Now Paranoia Prince Avalanche Europa Report ""Kick-Ass 2"" doesnt kick much ass.Well literally it does. In fact more derrieres probably were kicked in it than in the first ""Kick-Ass"" (though thankfully nothing here matches the gruesomeness of Nicolas Cages death in the original). However the sequel doesnt come anywhere close to matching the freshness outrageousness and fun of the original; nor does it manage to keep alive the irony and tongue-in-cheek delight of having overmatched nerds putting on costumes and trying to fight crime.Our high school hero Dave Lizewski/Kick-Ass (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) once again has his hands full with a re-energized and vengeful Chris DAmico/Red Mist (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) who assembles a psychotic band of killers to exact his revenge on Kick-Ass for the death of his father. The occasional doubt Red Mist showed in the original over whether he even wanted to be a super villain is completely gone. That is too bad because his character is now devoid of humanity. Hes just angry and wants to kill and the few attempts at giving him a shade of Dr. Evil-like humor fall flat.Advertisement Kick-Ass has another problem His strongest ally Hit-Girl (Chloe Grace Moretz) has abandoned crime-fighting to try being a normal high school student. The resulting semi-""Mean Girls"" subplot is probably the movies strongest storyline even if it is completely predictable. Hit-Girl stole the first movie -- and was the center of much of the films controversy about its violent crude content -- and she doesnt lose her appeal in the sequel. If only you could say that about the rest of the movie.Then theres the much-buzzed-about addition of Jim Carrey in the sequel. Unfortunately his turn as the Mafia hitman-turned costumed vigilante good-guy Stars and Stripes is terribly disappointing. Carrey -- who declined to promote the movie saying he felt it was too violent -- simply doesnt get enough screen time to invest his character with his patented brand of frenetic nuttiness. He could have made the movie so much better; if youve seen the trailers youve seen the best Stars and Stripes has to offer. Other notable actors such as Donald Faison and John Leguizamo are similarly wasted.Thats not to say the movie completely lacks heart. The naive earnestness of Kick-Ass as he attempts to fight evil is still there even if it isnt quite as desperate as in the first movie. The heroic buildup of Mindy transforming back into Hit-Girl pays off but not spectacularly. Still its terribly fun to watch Hit-Girl flatten a half-dozen grown men at a time (if only they could work her into the next ""Avengers"" film). But other than Hit-Girls action scenes much of the movies violence seems more serious and thus unsettling than in the first movie. Or maybe the concept has just worn out its welcome. Either way this feels like a movie that cant decide whether it wants to mirror the violence of a serious action-thriller or spoof it. Jim Carrye left and Aaron Taylor-Johnson star in ""Kick-Ass 2."" (Daniel Smith/Universal/MCT) ( Daniel Smith ) There are some questionable attempts at appealing to the 14-year-old boys in the audience projectile vomiting a rape joke extreme language. Then again the whole movie could be considered a questionable attempt at appealing to 14-year-old boys as the delightful irony of the first ""Kick-Ass"" was apparently exhausted before the sequel was made. ""Kick-Ass 2"" has its moments thanks mainly to Moretz. Hopefully when she rides off into the sunset at the end of ""Kick-Ass 2"" she has already decided she wont bother coming back for a ""Kick-Ass 3.""Contact Tony Hicks at Facebook.com/BayAreaNewsGroup.TonyHicks or Twitter.com/insertfoot.KICK-ASS 2   Rating R (for violence language and sexual content)Cast Aaron Taylor-Johnson Chloe Grace Moretz Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Jim CarreyDirector Jeff WadlowRunning Time 1 hour 43 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Curb Your Enthusiasm The long wait for new episodes is almost overGame of Thrones Season 8 definitely the last; Season 7 delay continuesReview Holocaust haunts family in The Gathering Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

A crudely entertaining genre hybrid that merges smart-alecky comicbook satire and semi-plausible vigilante fantasy to weird and wobbly effect ""Kick-Ass 2"" improves on its 2010 predecessor in at least one respect It doesnt make the mistake of trying to pass off its bone-crunching brutality as something shocking or subversive. Chloe Grace Moretz remains the standout asset of a series that like Hit Girl herself has entered an awkward adolescent stage; as diverting as this action-packed caper often is it feels not just weightless but emotionally and morally stunted whenever it veers into grown-up dramatic territory. Still thanks to a fresh infusion of comic energy from writer-director Jeff Wadlow the screw-loose sequel is certain to command a degree of attention despite or perhaps even because of its maddening unevenness.This story first appeared in the August 20 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. The 2010 Lionsgate film (budgeted at 30 million) grossed 96 million worldwide and became a sizable homevid hit suggesting enough of a core fanbase to lend this Universal release a sustained commercial life. As for Jim Carreys widely reported condemnation of the pictures splattery content it should only drum up publicity among target viewers who are likely to be more intrigued than deterred by warnings of excessive violence. While ""Kick-Ass"" director/co-writer Matthew Vaughn remains a producer (alongside several other members of the original producing team) the creative reins have been turned over to rising multihyphenate Wadlow who cut his teeth directing the 2008 boxing drama ""Never Back Down"" and has been a writer and producer on Aamp;Es ""Bates Motel."" The scribe-helmer takes an appreciably loose flippant approach to the ongoing Marvel series by Mark Millar and John S. Romita Jr. compressing elements from two individual series ""Kick-Ass 2"" and ""Hit Girl"" into a 103-minute narrative that employs regular cross-cutting comicbook-style captions and voiceover narration to keep its parallel plotlines in motion. As established in a punchy opening scene clumsy Dave Lizewski (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) better known as self-styled teenage superhero Kick-Ass has been toughening up thanks to a vigorous workout regimen prescribed by the younger far more formidable Mindy Macready (Moretz) aka Hit Girl. Together they plan to form a team of crime-fighters and clean up New York City but their plan hits a snag after a gory confrontation with a few street thugs during which Kick-Ass again displays weakness under pressure and Hit Girl again reveals her skill at separating men from their upper extremities. At the worried insistence of Marcus (Morris Chestnut) her legal guardian after her fathers untimely death in the first film Mindy agrees to retire her purple wig and enjoy whats left of her young adulthood. Her decision splits the film onto two tracks One charts Daves pursuits as he joins Justice Forever a sub-sub-Avengers league of amateur vigilantes while the other follows Mindys efforts to fit in at high school. It may surprise you to hear which of these two threads turns out to be more interesting. Of all the movies self-consciously referenced by this pulp-savvy series who knew that ""Mean Girls"" would yield the most wickedly funny results? Wadlow seems to be directly channeling that classic of high-school anxiety as Mindy befriends the most popular girls in school (led by queen bee Claudia Lee) experiences a mild sexual awakening via a boy-band musicvideo (courtesy of Brit group Union J) and comes perilously close to losing sight of who she really is. Its a sharp satisfying little story of bullying and comeuppance that works as well as it does on the strength of Moretzs terrific performance. The actress was 15 at the time of production old enough to ditch the pigtails and most of the uneasy child-exploitation issues that greeted the first film which is all to the good of a character who feels less gimmicky and more fully developed this time around. By turns touchingly vulnerable and frighteningly smart Mindy doesnt have to wield a blade much less the C-word to sustain our attention; a full standalone feature titled ""Hit Girl Goes to High School"" would have been no less engrossing. Kick-Ass by contrast remains one of the less involving characters in his own franchise and despite Taylor-Johnsons solid committed performance in the role his coming-of-age drama engages only up to a point. Abandoned by Mindy Dave joins forces with Col. Stars and Stripes (Carrey barely recognizable in facial prosthetics and army fatigues) the squads profanity-hating born-again-Christian leader; and other brave misfits with names like Dr. Gravity (Donald Faison) Insect Man (Robert Emms) and Night Bitch (Lindy Booth). For a while theyre having a good time doing good work attacking sex-trafficking gangsters with crotch-biting dogs that sort of thing. But soon Kick-Ass and his fellow fighters are under attack by the evil Red Mist aka Chris DAmico (a fully engaged Christopher Mintz-Plasse) who like an even more warped version of ""Spider-Mans"" Harry Osborn seeks revenge on the masked man responsible for his dads demise. Donning at least several hundred dollars worth of black fetish gear and reinventing himself as an uber-creep known as the Motherfucker (a nickname that makes perfect sense in context) he surrounds himself with his own team of murderous henchmen igniting an all-out war between good and evil. Of course those moral poles might as well be interchangeable where ""Kick-Ass 2"" is concerned its attitude toward the grisly proceedings falling somewhere between a shrug and a snigger. The result isnt nearly as puerile or self-satisfied as the first film which seemed all too in love with its own edginess but the sequel feels similarly at odds with itself -- determined not only to shock the complacent moviegoer with a dose of harsh real-world violence but also to send up the comicbook-superhero genre from a safely mocking distance. Perhaps Quentin Tarantino an obvious and oft-cited influence could have pulled off such a tricky tonal feat but in the hands of Vaughn and now Wadlow the snark and the sincerity simply cancel each other out. Whats left onscreen frequently feels callous and dehumanized whether its the sight of a freakishly ripped ex-KGB psychopath named Mother Russia (Olga Kurkulina) turning a lawnmower on a couple of cops or a scene that turns an implied rape into a queasy joke. Played for laughs that never quite arrive these moments dont sit well with the scripts attempts to say something genuinely thoughtful about the plight of fatherless kids (Mindy and Chris among others) the ability of masks to conceal trauma as well as identity and the dangerous allure of spending ones youth in an adult-free social-media-enabled fantasy world. Indeed by the time ""Kick-Ass 2"" reaches its eventful but unsurprising final showdown it seems to be playing things relatively straight to steadily dwindling returns. Making strong even sympathetic impressions amid the large ensemble are Carrey meting out justice with great gusto no matter what moral reservations set in after the fact; and John Leguizamo bringing a welcome note of humane skepticism to his role as the Motherfuckers paid lackey. The overall technical presentation is professional but undistinguished most evident in an exciting but roughly rendered highway sequence that places Hit Girl atop a speeding vehicle. Costume designer Shammy Sheldon Differ has a versatile eye for masks capes and other hero/villain accoutrements and production designer Russell De Rozario shows similar range with regard to the numerous Pinewood studio sets standing in for urban and suburban New York locations.

RJ Harris says August 15 2013 at 349 am Im a fan of both movie and comic loved the movie more. It was far superior to the first despite what couch ""nerds"" keeps saying. Go watch it for yourselves dont let over thought reviews ruin what is a very fun fast paced movie Reply Everton Carter (therealeverton) says August 14 2013 at 121 pm I thought that the first film was released in some countries by Lionsgate; but as Iron Man is not a Paramount film it is a Marvel Studios film Kick Ass was an independent  British film. thats right yes? Also this film was very entertaining but not quite as good an adaptation as Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughns Kick Ass. Reply cadavra says August 14 2013 at 301 pm Lionsgate passed on this. Since Universal handled it overseas they stepped in to pick up domestic as well.

Were Counting on You Kick-Ass 2 The original felt like it was designed for adolescents; this feels like it was made by an adolescent with a whopping case of ADHD ""I Hate Reboots"" says the shirt worn by teenage comic-book obsessive Dave (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) in ""Kick-Ass 2""; its a worthy sentiment that manages at least not to be hypocritical - after all its not like hes wearing a shirt that says ""I Hate Lazy Cynical Sequels"" which is exactly what this film is. While the 2010 ""Kick-Ass"" was far from perfect it did feel like a movie that understood the power fantasies of teenage boys with deadly accuracy. If the original felt like it was designed for adolescents however this follow-up feels like it was made by an adolescent one with a whopping case of ADHD. In telling the ongoing saga of Kick-Ass (Daves would-be-superhero identity) and his fellow costumed vigilantes and villains ""Kick-Ass 2"" is all over the map awkwardly seguing between over-the-top action comic-book satire and coming-of-age movie; the results are not unlike an eclectic comic-book collection thats been submerged in water and turned into one unreadable block. Also read Box-Office Record for Summer 2013? Were Counting on You Kick-Ass 2 Since the last movie Dave has hung up his green-and-yellow costume and returned to his humdrum life as a high-school senior -- and hes bored out of his mind. So when he figures out that freshman Mindy (Chloe Grace Moretz) is ditching class to continue training secretly as Hit Girl he begs her to become his mentor even though their combat sessions have to be kept secret from her guardian Marcus (Morris Chestnut). Meanwhile on Long Island the bratty and petulant Chris (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) still wants revenge against Kick-Ass for blowing up Chriss mobster father. When Chriss mother dies -- in a tanning-bed accident -- hes free to build an evil army to enact his vengeance.

And while shes navigating the cliques Kick-Ass joins up with Justice Forever a penny-ante Justice League led by former mob enforcer Colonel Stars and Stripes (Jim Carrey). Got all that? R-rated mayhem ensues with skulls splattering open amidst the wisecracks but the blend of ultra-violence and dark humor feels forced and inorganic this time around. Writer-director Jeff Wadlow (""Never Back Down"") never shows the skill that Matthew Vaughn mustered last time plodding through a series of hackneyed characters and contrived events. His script based on the comics by Mark Millar even throws in extraneous narration the telltale sign of a writer whos in over his head. Also read Brad Pitt Horror Ryan Reynolds and China The Summers Biggest Winners and Losers There are a few aspects of ""Kick-Ass 2"" that work from John Leguizamos deadpan manservant to Olga Kurkulina as Mother Russia a muscular and scantily-clad villainess who looks like she stepped right out of the pages of Howard Chaykins stylish and sardonic ""American Flagg"" comics but too much of the film winds up focusing on whiny teens and parents who just dont understand why their kids want to put on masks and bludgeon strangers in the middle of the night. The first ""Kick-Ass"" was a balancing act of challenging material that more often that not stayed aloft on the highwire; ""Kick-Ass 2"" comes crashing down to Earth over and over again soiling itself for good measure.

In the first issue of Mark Millar and John Romita Jr.s Kick-Ass comic from 2008 a lonely high school twerp dons a wetsuit and sets out to clean up the streets of New York. This white boys first adventure calling a trio of black graffiti taggers ""homos"" threatening them with his fighting sticks and then getting his ass stomped in brutal detail the movies just cant match. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Its a fight he picks a reminder that the impulse toward costumed do-goodery isnt far removed from the impulses of those sons of bitches who post in Internet comment threads that Trayvon Martin had it coming. In 2011 real-life superhero-wannabe The Ray who patrols the suburbs of San Francisco complained about black ""thugs"" to SF Weeklys Lauren Smiley ""Im not racist"" he insisted but ""stereotypes are stereotypes for a reason."" Recounting a fight in a skate park he said ""There were so many black people there they turned day into night.""The first Kick-Ass flick tidied all that up. The taggers become carjackers one white and one black. Theyve previously mugged the costumed aggressor and they work for the mob boss who will be the films principal villain. In short these guys according to story logic truly do have it coming--which means theres nothing complex or upsetting about Kick-Ass confronting them other than the violence itself which wasnt all that shocking as the movie was to the comic books what Coors Light is to an oatmeal stout. The comics soaked through as they are with arterial spray at least on occasion suggest that its destructive and stupid to go out looking for asses to kick. The movies not so much especially the shoddy original which aspired to be a grim sugar-rush yet posited that teens with self-esteem problems need only survive torture and a couple bloodbaths to land their out-of-their-league high-school crushes. (In the harder-edged comic that crush tells Kick-Ass to fuck off.)Film Details Kick-Ass 2 RatingR GenreAction/Adventure Running Time103 More Info Trailer The sequel is better in every way except one surprise. The original film (directed by Matthew Vaughn) peaked with the arrival of Hit-Girl (Chloe Grace Moretz) a nine-year-old demon moppet whose whirligig slaughter of a roomful of badasses was a comic high in both senses of comic. This was a hilarious cant-believe-they-filmed-it perversity the only time Vaughan improved upon Millar and Romitas gorgeous sometimes inexcusable work. But great as it was that scene made it absolutely clear that the filmmakers had no interest in the source materials interrogation of entertainment violence--instead of any horror at the sight of a pre-tween murdering bad guys who we havent seen do anything all that bad Kick-Ass the movie just asked us to get juiced on it.Kick-Ass 2 doesnt ask for much more but this time the juice gushes with impressive consistency usually with such power that you might not mind that director Jeff Wadlow even more than Vaughn has made sure that its only the images that are provocative--never the ideas.This time Kick-Ass (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) throws in with a league of misfit crimefighters organized by Jim Carreys born-again Colonel Stars and Stripes. Carrey is a stolid marvel straight out of a World War II-era comic cover a gray-stubbled G.I. with a Jack Kirby jaw. With this crew Kick-Ass takes the time to do the one thing all the other movie superheroes forgot to this year save some people from problems that werent a direct consequence of the existence of those superheroes.Hit-Girl meanwhile deepens into a full character as she takes on puberty and high school facing mean girls drill-team tryouts a first date and her promise to her adoptive father that shell try to live a normal life. (She seems to have been bit by that between-movies-aging bug that got hold of Anakin Skywalker.) Her scenes are surprisingly tender. Snuffling about with her peer group plucking up the courage to hang with them even as she tries to hide the steel inside her shes even more compelling than when shes playing the pixie avenger.She and Kick-Ass of course get pulled back into senseless satisfying battle this time by new villain the Mother Fucker who is actually just the same rich yutz Christopher Mintz-Plasse played in Kick-Ass. (Thankfully the originals many joyless scenes of conniving gangsters all showstoppers in the bad way are gone.) The Mother Fucker hires assassins and MMA types to serve as his own supervillain crew the Toxic Mega Cunts including former KGB killer Mother Russia a giantess whose one-on-one with Hit-Girl does not disappoint. In the name of revenge the Mega Cunts do some cop-killing and attempt to destroy Kick-Asss life--one noxious scene from the comic series a sexual assault is rewritten into a crowd-pleasing dick joke almost as if Wadlow (also the screenwriter) were weighing in on that argument Lindy West started at Jezebel Can rape ever be funny?The most welcome change is the tone. Wadlow has decided hes making a straight-up comedy and he demonstrates a knack for it. Theres a lightness even to the beatdowns and head-shots a punchline timing on the stabbings and severed limbs and the good sense to hustle through the dark material setting up the climax--a rumble West Side Story-style except with a shark tank and a heroine named Night Bitch. At its dark heart Kick-Ass 2 like its predecessor celebrates a worldview awfully close to Ted Nugents Wouldnt it be fun to bust the heads of some thugs? Thats not great but it beats ponderous follies like The Wolverine or The Dark Knight Rises which asked an even less fruitful question ""Wouldnt it be awesomely miserable?""Subscribe to the Voice Film Club podcastFollow VoiceFilmClub1 Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Alan Scherstuhl Follow studiesincrap Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

"Kick-Ass 2 - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Kick-Ass 2 Posted by Christy Lemire on August 14 2013 3 Comments Universal Pictures Rated R for strong violence pervasive language crude and sexual content and brief nudity. Running time 103 minutes. Two stars out of four. Jim Carreys character in ""Kick-Ass 2"" an ex-mobster and born-again Christian whos transformed himself into a vigilante crimefighter named Colonel Stars and Stripes carries a handgun on his person at all times. He keeps it unloaded though because he doesnt actually want to use it -- he just wants the bad guys he confronts to think hes willing and able to pull the trigger. This becomes a noteworthy plot point which is intriguing for a couple of reasons. Since wrapping the film Carrey famously has distanced himself from the finished product saying he now feels squeamish about promoting it given the enormous amount of gun violence it contains. But the unloaded gun is also unfortunately a rather apt metaphor for the movie itself. ""Kick-Ass 2"" may look powerful but doesnt have much real pop. Part of the problem is that the novelty of the original ""Kick-Ass"" is gone. The idea of a pint-sized preteen potty-mouthed assassin was exciting and daringly hilarious when the first film came out in 2010. Now Mindy Macready/Hit-Girl -- and Chloe Grace Moretz the confident and likable actress who plays her -- are a little older and a little wiser which also makes this sequel a little heavier. The larger issue is the direction especially in the action sequences of which there are many. The ""Kick-Ass"" world springs from the graphically violent comics by Mark Millar and John S. Romita Jr. While Matthew Vaughn brought the action to life with great style and verve in directing the first film -- the whole thing had a thrilling energy about it really -- writer-director Jeff Wadlow doesnt stage these segments of the sequel with nearly as much fluidity or finesse. Wadlow is entirely too fond of using shaky-cam during fight sequences; rather than upping the tension this approach creates chaos and it detracts from the intricacy and complex choreography of these massive showdowns. ""Kick-Ass 2"" is actually more compelling in its relatable real-world moments as Mindy tries to navigate the many social perils that await any high-school freshman. Its a precarious time under optimal circumstances but she must endure the added burden of having recently lost her beloved father/crime-fighting partner Big Daddy. And while many kids feel like they dont fit in at this awkward stage the fact that 15-year-old Mindy is a coolly efficient killing machine really and truly makes her an outcast -- but a self-imposed one. And that makes her more interesting. Rather than longing to fit in with the cool girls she tests the shark-filled waters on her own terms then exacts her revenge when she gets bitten. Mindy would much rather carry on the proud legacy she shared with Big Daddy (played by Nicolas Cage in the original) of righting wrongs and keeping the city safe. Aaron Taylor-Johnson whos back as nerdy high school senior Dave Lizewski/Kick-Ass is eager to fight alongside her. (The title is ""Kick-Ass 2"" but this really feels like Hit-Girls movie; the secretly sexy Taylor-Johnson doesnt get much to work with in the character-development department.) Daves superhero exploits from the first film made him a bit of a celebrity around town to the point that hes inspired legions of wannabes to don homemade costumes assume mysterious identities and troll the streets at night looking for their own asses to kick. But Mindys been ordered to pack away her throwing stars and nunchucks and hang up the sparkly purple get-up for good; her fathers best friend Marcus (Morris Chestnut) whos now her guardian promised to keep her safe so he forbids her from fighting any more crime. This abstinence from ass-whooping becomes increasingly difficult when Chris DAmico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) whose father Kick-Ass killed in spectacular fashion in part one reinvents himself as a supervillain called The Motherfucker to seek revenge. This essentially calls on him to bark out orders in a lisp while dressed in his mothers domnatrix gear. Its an amusingly ridiculous image at first but as the costume becomes more elaborate it feels like its sole purpose is to shock. Just as The Motherfucker assembles an army of henchmen (and women) to take out Kick-Ass Kick-Ass joins a ragtag team of good guys calling themselves Justice Forever. Their leader is the intensely earnest Colonel Stars and Stripes a camo-clad crusader with a patriotic German shepherd by his side. Carrey is unrecognizable here even once the mask comes off with his buzz cut gold teeth and gravelly New York accent. Millar was right when he said in response to Carreys detachment from the film that hes great in the role; its a dialed-down performance but no less insane than his wilder well-known work. If it sounds like theres a lot going on with too many characters and subplots to keep track of thats probably because it is. ""Kick-Ass 2"" suffers from a lack of narrative focus as well as inconsistent pacing. It lurches into action frantically noisily then screeches to a halt for cliched conversations about finding the inner superhero hiding within all of us. For a film that seems so subversive on its surface ""Kick-Ass 2"" is really rather feel-good after all. Tweet Category Reviews Tags Aaron Taylor-Johnson action Chloe Grace Moretz Christopher Mintz-Plasse comic book Jim Carrey Summer movies 3 Comments on ""Kick-Ass 2"" August 14 2013  by  Sean Saffari     awesome review. Reply August 17 2013  by  Brian Stewart     This was a fantastic review and while I agree its a stylistic step down from Kick-Ass and the novelty has worn off of the shock factor the movie does give you plenty more to consider as it barrels hilariously towards its finale. I think people yourself included Christy are suffering from shaky cam fatigue. Its used well here. The action is clear if not as crunchy and pop as the original. The whole orchestration of how Justice Forever works as a team how could you argue that the scene doesnt work shaky cam or no? Reply October 25 2013  by  Chris McCarron     Since the birth of my son I havent had a chance to catch much at the cinema. Any idea when the blu-ray is due out?

Back then Kick-Ass exploded like a grenade of brattish energy and ultraviolence. The slightly disappointing sequel is less anarchic and more slick. Youll still be laughing but where Kick-Ass giggled at action cliches this sometimes slips into them. Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) is dead and Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) has been adopted by his old cop partner. Now 15 and starting high school she has promised to hang up the nunchucks for good. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is back as Dave Lizewski the high-school nerd whose only superpower is not dying of shame wearing a green wetsuit on New Yorks streets. Daves amateur heroics as Kick-Ass went viral on YouTube and spawned a generation of have-a-go avengers. Now theres an amateur league of superheroes led by Jim Carrey. Carrey has since withdrawn support for Kick-Ass 2 slamming its level of violence. But his toothpaste grin has never been wider as he slices and dices. What lures Hit-Girl out of retirement is Red Mist (Christopher Mintz-Plasse). Hes now The Motherfucker wearing his dead mums skintight fetish outfits. The best thing about Kick-Ass was Moretz and Hit-Girl still gets the best lines. Like the first film Kick-Ass 2 pulls the reality of teen life into its fantasy. But Hit-Girl was homeschooled on the weight-to-velocity rates of bullets. So how will she now deal with classroom bitches? The answer is a little lame. Elsewhere theres plenty to enjoy if a bit guiltily at times. Carrey has an issue with the films violence. My problem is the sex. Kick-Ass was full of boytastic bad taste - Dave whacking off to a fantasy involving his teacher. Harmless teen boy stuff. Kick-Ass 2 notches it up with an offensive rape joke (man tries to rape woman cant get it up). Okay hes the butt of the joke but in a film whose heroine is a 15-year-old girl beating up a bunch of bad dudes thats not just bad taste - it leaves a bad taste.

FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 16 2013Rachel BrookFeaturedJeff Wadlows follow-up to Matthew Vaughns Kick-Ass the lurid 2010 film adapted from Mark Millars graphic novel may have shed the franchises original director but Kick-Ass 2 is just as bloody funny and awkward as its predecessor. Aaron Taylor-Johnson returns as the bumbling Dave Lizewski reprising the role which helped shoot him to fame. Dave too finds he must reprise his alter-ego the titular Kick-Ass in order to bring down the sociopathic Chris DAmico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) who has fashioned himself into supervillain The Motherfucker and is hell-bent on avenging the death of his crime lord father. Despite the time elapsed since Kick-Asss release the narrative arcs of the two films are as closely tied as youd expect considering the source material and comic book influences are tangible not just in the plot but in Kick-Ass 2s aesthetics. Comic-book style text is superimposed over shots used to bridge from one scene to another in much the same way as text is used to introduce frames in printed comics. This is a far more original touch than the generic epic/action score by Henry Jackman and Matthew Margeson which is effective although familiar. The films hook is Daves friendship with Mindy Macready (Chloio Grace Moretz) AKA the tough-as-nails vigilante Hit-Girl. As Dave welcomes Kick-Ass back into his life Mindy wrestles with the promises made to her surrogate father Marcus (Morris Chesnut) and the crime-fighting she is continually pulled toward. Its Hit-Girl whos the true hero of this film; shes the superhero you want to see back in costume and in action and her prominence is refreshing considering the prevalence of male superheroes brought to the big screen. The script will keep you waiting here but meanwhile Mindys experience of bitchy cliques is as well-played as similar angst in any dedicated high school movie (of course excepting Mean Girls). As Mindy is hazed by the queen bee and her minions Moretz is poignant although her considerable talent with painful emotion is far better demonstrated in Derek Martinis Hick. The apt and hilarious (though unoriginal) high school drama is oddly matched by the latter half of the film where most of the blood is shed. Mintz-Plasses Motherfucker builds an army of psychos and ex-cons to take on Kick-Asss superhero team Justice Forever. (Of course Hit-Girl is the crucial missing piece needed to strengthen Justice Forevers motley crew). Those who kicked up a fuss in response to the ultra-violence of Nicholas Winding Refns Drive were fighting the wrong battle; Drive may be brutal and bloody but all of the violence is in service of the gangster plot and the body count is kept to a minimum. The same cannot be said for either Kick-Ass movie. Kick-Ass 2s climax sends the body count into the hundreds limbs are frequently slashed off and the floor is awash with fake blood and shards of broken glass. Its not only the violence that makes parts of Kick-Ass 2 uncomfortable to watch; allusion to sexual abuse is followed by an erectile dysfunction gag and young actors receive plenty of voyeuristic attention. Queen bee Brooke (Claudia Lee) gives an inappropriately sexualised performance when auditioning for the high school dance club but plugging/mocking of Brit boy band Union J ensures that males are just as objectified as females and sets up for the films best joke. The audience are teased however and must wait until the final act before Taylor-Johnsons toned torso appears onscreen. Kick-Ass 2s odd mixture of gore-porn touching coming-of-age drama and gross-out comedy ends by priming us for another sequel the concluding chapter which has already prompted speculative would-be spoilers all over the internet. Heres hoping Kick-Ass will finally upgrade his costume.

So in my opinion the current film has a real reputation to live up to and it has a damn good go given that it can never get the same kudos for originality. Aaron Johnson in particular gives an equivalent excellent performance as the vulnerable hero without the Super powers Ms Moretz fulfills her part well though I thought that she could have been given a little more time to establish how she was supposed to be fitting in with her new life. The treatment of Kickasss girl interests seemed a bit slam-bam this time round. I would not say that this film is ""stronger"" in any way than the first and I have to wonder what sort of film Mr Carrey thought he was signing up for. MF did not quite work quite as well for me as Red Mist did. The ending draws things to a close for the amateur heroes but then suggests that Iron-ass may be on the way if so then it stands to reason that Hit Girl will return with ""post 16"" possibilities - I hope that the writers are exceedingly careful and do not ruin the dynamic between them. I expect that reviewers of this film are preaching to the converted If you enjoyed the first then definitely go see if you did not then the new film will do nothing to change your view.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 16 2013fueldragsterFeaturedFor me the first film was the most surprisingly enjoyable film of the year truly brilliant and the only alteration I would have suggested was adding a specific joke at the end.
