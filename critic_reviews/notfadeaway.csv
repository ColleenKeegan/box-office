LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Rated R. 112 minutes. At area theaters. ""Not Fade Away"" might have been one of the best-loved movies of 2012. Its a coming-of-age story focused on a 1960s rock n roll band of teenage friends. Its a romantic drama from ""The Sopranos"" creator David Chase. At first look it has all the ingredients of something really lovely. Muted romantic shots of kids making out in cars. Electrical scenes with kids worshipping the Rolling Stones at band practice in their parents basement. Dynamic breakfast-table dialogue pitting kids against their uncompassionate parents. All via Chases soft-around-the-edges lens -- an eye that has given us characters as complex as Tony Soprano and Dr. Jennifer Melfi. This film could have been -- should have been even -- something special. But its not. ""Not Fade Away"" is as unremarkable as most of the thousands of bands inspired by the 60s British Invasion. Surprisingly a first-time filmmaker here Chase doesnt give us much to hold onto -- not a lot to hope for or even care about. The oblivious-to-all love story. The defiant music. The tumultuous familial relationships. Weve seen this before -- and better. Douglas (John Magaro) is the main kid here. First hes lucky enough to play drums with a band in his Jersey hometown and soon hes taking over the mic recognizing that hes the better singer than his buddy. The girl hes long dreamed about Grace (Bella Heathcote) starts paying closer attention to his newfound confidence. And his band graduates from house parties to label auditions -- all while Douglas fights the stodgy world around him including his old-world father (James Gandolfini). You want to enjoy the deja-vu pairing of director Chase with actor Gandolfini -- who was his lead Tony in ""The Sopranos."" Turns out E Street Band member ""Little Steven"" Van Zandt who played Silvio Dante on the HBO mob drama is also the films executive producer and music director. But those connections arent enough to pull this hodgepodge of a film together -- not even with the excellent new song ""St. Valentines Day Massacre"" a prominently placed tune (written and produced by Van Zandt sung by Magaro) that is the one creative block specific to this film and nothing else.

Comments (2) click to enlarge Not Fade Away Video Rated R  112 minutes  2012 David Chase who created and wrote much of The Sopranos prefers movies to television and for his debut in the medium hes chosen to dip into his own past as an aspiring rocker in 60s New Jersey. John Magaro stars as a young man whose life is changed when he sees the Rolling Stones on TV; striped pants Cuban-heeled boots band rehearsals and angry arguments with working-class dad James Gandolfini ensue. There are some piercing father-son moments and Molly Price is wonderful as the protagonists sweetly progressive little sister but the stock romance and interband squabbles have little more gravitas than in That Thing You Do (which was certainly more fun). The period details are spot-on and the soundtrack is great; the music supervisor was garage-rock encyclopedia Steven Van Zandt another Sopranos veteran along for this Corvair ride down memory lane.

Like that seminal HBO series Not Fade Away is set in New Jersey and co-stars James Gandolfini. But the suburban world it chronicles is worlds away from Tony Sopranos Bada Bing and other Mob hangouts.STORY Sopranos mates Chase Gandolfini wont Fade AwayVIDEO David Chase discusses his new film Not Fade AwayMORE Chase revisits the SixtiesThis story is set in the mid-1960s and focuses on Douglas (John Magaro) who is in a band and yearns to be a famous rocker. His dad (Gandolfini) is inflexible and authoritarian -- he hates his sons anti-war stance Dylan-esque hair and Mod wardrobe. His favorite insult ""You look like you just got off the boat.""The film has enough minor plot threads for a miniseries and thats where Chase trips up even though he created one of the best dramatic series of all time. Character is revealed over time and can change in believable ways in episodic television. But here Chase crams a lot into a two-hour film and while some of it works not all of it does.Not Fade Away is on stronger footing when it focuses on the main story of Douglas artistic evolution from musician to filmmaker. When it digresses into the tales of his friends or their relatives it falters.This is particularly true in a plot thread involving the druggy sister (Dominique McElligott) of Douglas girlfriend who is institutionalized by her parents. There are several story lines like this that feel shoehorned into the larger tale. The romance between Douglas and Grace (Bella Heathcote) seems perfunctory. And while Douglas spunky younger sister Evelyn (Meg Guzulescu) is a more intriguing female character shes given little to do.Like Douglas Chase grew up in New Jersey suburbia and played rock covers as a teen. If the movie is read as autobiography it was music that inspired Chases film aspirations. Douglas says ""I like the idea of putting music together with film"" and Chases fascination with the same was brilliantly evident in The Sopranos and here.The soundtrack is an eclectic sampling of some of the best 60s tunes from lesser-known bands like The Left Banke to famous rockers like the Kinks and Rolling Stones that effectively evokes the era. The times were indeed a-changing and that message is poignantly communicated in a wordless montage where Douglas dad watches South Pacific as Douglas and Grace arrive at a California beach.As the saga of a teenager who wants to be a rock star then gradually realizes he wont achieve that dream Not Fade Away sometimes feels a trifle worn. But as an affectionate tribute to rock n roll and a moody look at the 60s it makes a more powerful impression.Not Fade Away Clip Home From CollegeSkip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Pat (James Gandolfini) is unamused with Dogulas (John Magaro) hair and clothes as he returns home for Thanksgiving from college. 28 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/UhSdOg",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/01/03/not-fade-away-review/1764451/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+UsatodaycomMovies-TopStories+%28Life+-+Movies+-+Top+Stories%29&utm_content=Google+Reader,200,notfadeaway4,notfadeaway,usatoday

RELATED NEWS Interview Director David Chase By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Jan 3 2013 945 AM If you create something as culturally momentous as ""The Sopranos"" everything you do after that will be judged against it.Thats the curse. The blessing is well you created ""The Sopranos."" So theres that.David Chases new film ""Not Fade Away"" is solid enjoyable good but not great. Since it comes from Chase who infused everything about the HBO hit about a mobster and his two families (the nuclear and Mafia kind) with so much pop-culture goodness you could dissect every episode for days waiting for the next it feels like kind of a disappointment. But what it gets right it gets really right.Its the story of Douglas (John Magaro) growing up in suburban New Jersey. Hes a drummer in the 1960s who wants to be a rock star. (Chase was a New Jersey kid who grew up in the 1960s and was a drummer and wanted to be a rock star.) None of his experiences is particularly revelatory. Douglas and his friends chase girls smoke marijuana oppose the Vietnam War tick off their parents. You know the usual. Its all nicely done with good performances.But what Chase really nails is that world of would-be musicians who are good enough to believe in their dream but not quite good enough to achieve it. Theres a bit at the beginning where a young Keith Richards runs into Mick Jagger on a bus in London. That meeting would of course lead to the formation of the Rolling Stones.And soon Douglas would be drumming in bands that aped the Stones sound stealing the lead vocalist gig from his friend improving the band. They arent just fooling around with this. They practice. Douglas drops out of college adding to the list of things that infuriate his father (James Gandolfini the star of ""The Sopranos""). They get good. They get better. To varying degrees for each member of the band this is their life. Or at least it will be for a year or two.Thats what so many films ignore the work and sacrifice that even the goofiest bands go through trying to make it. There are plenty of laughs along with the melodrama as the band and its members struggle through young adulthood.Then there is the harsh truth. We understand long before Douglas and most of his bandmates do that even though they are pretty good theyre never going to be quite good enough. The coming to this realization for each of them in particular Douglas is expertly portrayed. Its also just one part of the movie.Theres an odd framing device with Douglas sister (Meg Guzulescu) who also drops in on occasion to narrate. Magaro is good as Douglas who goes from shy to confident to fairly obnoxious looking more and more like Bob Dylan as he goes along. His burgeoning relationship with Grace (Bella Heathcoate) feels appropriately awkward. Jack Huston is perfect as Eugene the bands guitarist and original lead singer whos a little farther than the rest of the group from figuring out his life. A meeting with a music-industry guy (Brad Garrett) puts their hopes and ambitions into perspective.What there isnt enough of are moments like the one shared between Douglas and his father who for reasons spelled out in the film becomes reflective and wistful. Douglas reaction particularly at this point in his life is spot-on. Its a nice break from the bluster of Gandolfinis character a stand-out moment.How best to describe ""Not Fade Away""? Its got a good beat you can dance to it. But like the band at its center it never quite reaches its goals.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

Photo Credit MCT advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT In the early 1960s a group of New Jersey teenagers forms a rock band. BOTTOM LINE A heartfelt but muddled film debut from David Chase whose affection for rock and roll cant overcome weak characters and a narrative vacuum. CAST John Magaro Bella Heathcote James Gandolfini Will Brill LENGTH 152 In ""Not Fade Away"" first-time filmmaker David Chase (HBOs ""The Sopranos"") pens a love letter to the dawn of the 1960s that could only come from someone who was there. Chase 67 clearly has a lot of feelings to express though he isnt sure how. The result is a movie that feels at once deeply personal and more than a little confused. ""Its not an autobiography"" Chase has said though the evidence often contradicts him. The central character of Doug (John Magaro) has much in common with his creator Italian-American raised in New Jersey by a difficult mother (Molly Price) and a bullying father (a very good James Gandolfini) drumming in a rock band but toying with the idea of film school. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Magaro leads an ensemble of charismatic newcomers who keep this movie watchable despite its disjointed aimless feel. The bands guitarist Wells (Will Brill) talks a bigger game than he plays singer Eugene (Jack Huston the ""Boardwalk Empire"" star and nephew of the actor Danny Huston) proves an erratic stage presence and various rhythm sections come and go. Meanwhile Doug takes over vocals but begins focusing more on pretty Grace (Bella Heathcote of ""Dark Shadows"") than on his band which never even decides on a name. ""Not Fade Away"" which shares its title with the Rolling Stones 1964 cover of a Buddy Holly tune wants to sum up the simultaneous adolescences of Doug the nation and rock music. (The inclusion of the Sex Pistols mangled cover of ""Roadrunner"" a 1979 anachronism suggests a vague theory.) Ultimately though theres no story on which to hang these larger themes. The band were following barely exists which means no dreams are ever broken no lessons ever learned. As for Doug who seems increasingly drawn to film and television we already know what will happen to him. PLOT In the early 1960s a group of New Jersey teenagers forms a rock band.

And you can surmise that the same music saved the life of the restless suburban New Jersey teen David Chase now 67 who escaped west to become a successful L.A.-based writer and producer of TV shows then made the Garden State the center of the universe with his masterpiece HBO series The Sopranos. Not Fade Away is Chases reward to himself -- a transparently autobiographical work his first feature-length film and one that hes said he has wanted to make for years. (His consigliere on the project is Steven Van Zandt he of the double-play fame as The Sopranos Silvio Dante and Bruce Springsteens E Street Band buddy.) Like Douglas Chase was once a drummer in his own Jersey band obsessed with the sounds of the early-60s British Invasion -- the Beatles the Stones the Kinks the Animals -- and the liberation those lads unleashed. Like Douglas Chase was at odds with his Italian-American parents who didnt understand their sons ways (and ai Marone his long hair). Like Douglas the filmmaker was nurtured by a caring high school girlfriend. (Chase married his girl Denise Kelly; theyre married still.) All these similarities are lovely and lovingly enacted with the kind of attention to the details of time and place -- and the glorious evocative soundtrack -- that made The Sopranos so engrossing an experience episode after episode. The furniture in the family den looks right. The make-out sessions look right. (Lucky Douglas The skinny fuzzy-haired squirt wins over the girl of his dreams played by Bella Heathcote whos blessed with the cool beauty of 60s supermodel Jean Shrimpton.) But combined with Chases tender urgency to pack so many personally meaningful elements into a timeline that can sustain only so much without lagging its the very episode-after-episode instinct that trips the filmmaker up. And then theres the discombobulating if exciting presence of James Gandolfini as Douglas hot-tempered bear of a father. Chase asks an awful lot of the forceful actor to play another New Jersey Italian-American hothead -- even one whos Mob-free -- and make him fresh. (Up-and-coming Magaro a pale presence looks even more nebbishy by comparison.) Its asking a lot of the audience too to look at Gandolfini and not see Tony Soprano but a different angry beaten-down man who cant talk to his kids and bullies his wife. (Molly Price is defeated by the stacked challenge of playing such a dismissive cartoon of a hysteric.) Fercryinoutloud when the old man is stressed he sits on the couch watching TV and cradling a bowl of ice cream. Who do we know who used to do that? The good news is that Not Fade Away -- the title is taken from a Buddy Holly song -- sends Douglas off into a happier future. Rock amp; roll is here to stay. And David Chase gets some well-deserved satisfaction.

Its the 1960s in suburban New Jersey a time and place - and state of mind - diligently re-created by David Chase in his nostalgic but emotionally true coming-of-age tale Not Fade Away. Chase creator of The Sopranos - the family saga whose patriarch Tony Soprano becomes the grumpy blue-collar dad here - mines his personal experiences and his love of early rock and roll to winning effect. The filmmaker builds his tale around Douglas (a very good John Magaro) a gawky high schooler who gains confidence and the approving gaze of the girls when he steps behind his drum kit and starts thrashing out crisp cool beats. He and his pals (Jack Huston Will Brill) inspired by the likes of Messrs. Lennon and McCartney Jagger and Richards have formed a band the Twylight Zones that plays in basements and backyards at church dances and hippie soirees. Once Douglas asserts himself leaving the drums to sing lead the group actually starts to be good. This could be a career. And this could be the straw that breaks the camels back between Douglas and his father (James Gandolfini) who wont tolerate the antiwar dinner-table talk or the way his son has been dressing. ""If you want to wear Cuban heels"" he snaps ""go live in Cuba."" Of course theres a girl Grace Deitz (Bella Heathcote last seen in Tim Burtons Dark Shadows) is the impossibly beautiful sophisticated classmate who actually tells Douglas she likes his voice. Its the beginning of a heady relationship that starts in Garden State driveways winds its way to grungy East Village walk-ups and reaches a moody messy climax in a surfside house in L.A. So yes Chase covers lots of ground - geographically chronologically musically. With astute assistance from Steve Van Zandt (The Sopranos cast member and Springsteen cohort) who supervised the soundtrack and composed one catchy gem of a would-be pop hit ""St. Valentines Day"" Chase pays homage to old American bluesmen Ramp;B greats and the British Invaders who recognized their genius. ""I dont get it"" the teenage bandmates muse getting stoned and listening to the Rolling Stones. ""How come the English knew all about the blues but its been under our nose the whole time?"" Now and then Not Fade Away falls back perhaps inevitably on certain narrative conventions and cliches. The vintage cars and clothes may be too perfect the breakup scenes too big the kitchen-table admonishments too rote. And Chase bookends his movie with voice-overs from an interested bystander Douglas younger sister Evelyn (Meg Guzulescu). The last shot though lovely in its So-Cal surrealness seems off-point and anachronistic if you take the song selection - the Sex Pistols version of ""Roadrunner"" - literally. But thats nit-picking. Mostly Not Fade Away is a hit. Contact Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com. Read his blog ""On Movies Online"" at www.philly.com/onmovies.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Dec. 28 2012 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Dec. 28 2012 1200AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by David Chase Written by David Chase Starring John Magaro James Gandolfini Bella Heathcote Classification 14A Year 2012 Country USA Language English Not Fade Away does fade away. Its meant to be an evocative return to the rock n roll turbulence of the sixties with none other than Plato himself providing the (paraphrased) grace note ""When the mode of the music changes the walls of the city shake."" Well theres definitely a whole lotta shakin goin on here but not so you urgently feel it. Instead the picture plays like an episodic exercise in sweet nostalgia. Coming from writer/director David Chase the guy who put the Bada Bing into The Sopranos that sweetness is a surprise. And an occasional delight. But ultimately a disappointment - this is a movie easy to watch and even easier to forget. Multimedia Not Fade Away official trailer The irony is obvious. Having reinvented long-form television in The Sopranos ushering in the current renaissance Chase in his belated feature debut (hes 67) has managed only to underscore todays critical consensus - that the large screen has become less compelling than the small. The New Jersey setting is the same but gone are his trenchant dialogue and evolving character arcs replaced by little more than the basic tropes of the sixties era you know hair long skirts short war and parents bad rock and peace good the times they are a changin.Basic too is his reliance on the conveniently placed and programmed TV set whose grainy images duly check off the iconic events a President falls in Dallas soldiers die in Vietnam protesters march in Washington. Such a weary device - its become the Wikepedia entry of cinematic gimmicks.More refreshing and engaging is the scripts twist on the old story. Essentially this is a star-is-not-born tale as Chase reflects on his thwarted musical ambitions. His alter ego is Douglas (John Magaro) whom we first pick up in the early sixties. Still in high school hes an aspiring drummer and a frustrated lover looking on enviously at the crewcuttedjocks with the prettiest girls and freely copping to his physical short-comings ""Ive got a skinny physique and a scuzzy complexion"". Quick cut to that flickering TV screen where Mick Jagger has an entire audience of adoring females in thrall to his skinny and scuzzy self. The penny drops; a wannabe star hastens to his drum kit.A mere college semester later Douglas returns with a mop of Dylanesque curls a fledgling band that covers Stones tunes at house parties and a laid-back liberalism that aint welcome in the family kitchen which Chase keeps revisiting to pound home the usual domestic dispute. There while Mom slips into a whining depression and his young sister looks on wide-eyed (she doubles unwisely as our voice-over narrator) Douglas and Dad snarl across the generation gap. James Gandolfini is the patriarch again and a good thing too. The son may be the protagonist but the father steals the picture. Gandolfini rescues the character from stereotype sensitively capturing the mans own inner battles - with encroaching illness with dampened passion with stifling religion (theres no God in this father) and climactically with an innate tenderness that trumps the toughness.From there the years and the plot both unfold as we know they must. The boy needs a love-interest so Douglas falls for Grace the beautiful rich girl (Bella Heathcote); the band needs its turmoil so Douglas falls out with Eugene the under-performing guitarist. En route Chase stirs in a bunch of sub-plots - Graces older sibling flirts with drugs Grace herself flirts with feminism and poor Dad flirts with divorce - that only distract from the films ostensible focus and further clutter an already episodic narrative.Happily the sweetness has real appeal and multiple sources. It can be heard in the music a pastiche of golden oldies smartly curated by Steve Van Zandt. It can be seen in the figure of Douglas wooden but at least a credible totem of the times - the idealism the naivete the narcissism and yes the hypocrisy of sixties youth. And it can be sensed in the atmosphere in a period when a garage band was truly just a small break away from a big hit when fame felt closer to hand and celebrity less remote when the wall of possibility seemed lower and thinner and much more porous.Consequently baby-boomers of Chases vintage will watch this movie through the same rear-view mirror he used in making it - remembering their thwarted ambitions their callow loves their tough and tender dads. I know I did. And I know nostalgia gives the heart a gentle tug until the house lights come up on the onrushing present and nostalgia fades away.

Share Tweet By Ty Burr Globe Staff | 12.27.12 | 229 PM Not Fade Away"" is the second of two recent films in which a successful son of Hollywood gets up close and personal. The first was Judd Apatows ""This Is 40"" which concerns itself with the stresses of the present. ""Not Fade Away"" is about the romance of the past and it comes to us from writer-director David Chase who made his bones with ""The Sopranos"" but has apparently been carrying this movie around inside his head for decades. All I can say is beware of filmmakers whove been carrying pet projects around for decades Theyve long since lost the necessary distance and they want to cram everything in. (See ""The Tree of Life"" for a more epic example.) ""Not Fade Away"" is Chases fictionalized memoir of growing up a rebellious rock-loving teenager in suburban New Jersey and its both achingly affectionate and a terrible mess. Chases metier it turns out is the one-hour present-tense drama. Aiming for a generational statement that encompasses the entire 60s experience he turns unexpectedly inept. Related Link Find showtimes and theaters That said there are lovely moments amid the rubble. ""Not Fade Away"" even begins with one a teenage nebbish named Doug (John Magaro) in a high school auditorium looking longingly at The Girl (Bella Heathcote as the upper-class Grace) as she looks longingly at the band onstage. Right there is the source of so many rock n roll dreams If I get on that stage she might see me. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Dougs a drummer after a fashion bashing out variations on ""The Twist."" Then the Beatles hit and the Stones and suddenly Doug looks at Mick and Keef and realizes a skinny physique and a scuzzy complexion arent so bad after all. He joins a band led by the local music stud (Jack Huston) and one night during a house-party gig Doug takes lead vocals on ""Time Is on My Side."" The miracle happens The Girl sees him. ""Not Fade Away"" might be content to stay in that moment and its immediate aftermath -- like a more concentrated version of John Sayless 1983 classic ""Baby Its You"" -- but Chase keeps going. And going. The V-neck shirts turn to leather jackets and caftans Dougs hair sprouts out and up until hes a ringer for Al Kooper circa 1966 the soundtrack expands to include the Kinks Dylan the blues Van Morrison and ""Itchykoo Park"" before leaving us on the doorstep of the Sex Pistols cover of Jonathan Richmans ""Roadrunner."" There are breakups and makeups fistfights and motorcycle crashes demos and a meeting with music industry powerhouse Jerry Ragavoy (Brad Garrett suitably crass). Dougs dad is played by James Gandolfini as a defeated working-class lump -- Tony Soprano robbed of all power -- who cant understand how his son will get into the Army looking like a fruit. It goes on cancer scares and mental institutions and weird older sisters playing Robert Johnson records up in the attic. ""Not Fade Away"" namechecks the cultural watersheds with knowing confidence. (Doug to Grace in a screening of Antonionis ""Blow-Up"" ""What kinda movie is this? Nothing happens."") Chase knows that a line like ""I left my roach clip at Oberlin"" can sum up an entire era and when the film pauses to simply take in the glory of Bo Diddley singing his namesake tune on TV it locates the heartbeat that sustained a lot of peoples adolescences. The problem is that Chase cant figure out how to put the pieces together. ""Not Fade Away"" is shockingly flat-footed when it comes to filmmaking basics like temporal transitions -- were always shooting awkwardly forward into the next pop moment -- and his dialogue drifts and stalls with frustrating lack of purpose. The artier camera choices seem odd Why are we zooming into Dougs ear? The film is narrated by a minor character the heros little sister (Meg Guzulescu) for no discernible reason. Its as though Chase were pouring his entire youth onto the kitchen table without any idea of how to shape it. So he doesnt. By the time Doug sees a mysterious omen in the sky for the second time you realize youre watching a film of very private meanings. Sometimes those meanings coalesce into something quite beautiful. Toward the end Doug walks the midnight streets of Los Angeles lost and found at the same time the future stretching out before him like an open boulevard. You can almost see the 20-year-old David Chase superimposed onto the character and anyone who has been young and at the start of something may shiver in recognition. For all its ungainliness we should be glad he made this movie. We should be just as glad he got it out of his system. Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

"Not Fade Away movie review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Not Fade Away like a Rolling Stone  Not Fade Away Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune ""That pianola sure brings back memories"" says Orson Welles entranced by Marlene Dietrichs bordello background music in ""Touch of Evil."" A few moments of this scene pop up on somebodys television in ""Not Fade Away"" the wry feature film debut by writer-director David Chase creator of ""The Sopranos.""The ""Touch of Evil"" scenes there for a reason. Whoever we are wherever we grew up a chord a chorus a song always waits to airlift us back to our former selves. For Chase clearly the band the Rolling Stones is his touchstone. Early in ""Not Fade Away"" set in the 1960s and mostly in New Jersey Mick Jagger and the Stones make their American TV debut on a Dean Martin-hosted special. Though Dino rolled his eyes (as did half the nations viewers) many were slain and hooked. Somewhat autobiographical and worth seeing despite its somewhat muffled quality ""Not Fade Away"" deals with one such fan Douglas Damiano played by John Magaro. We follow Dougs experience in a high school band; the band after high school; Doug in love and on the outs with his baffled family (why wont he get a haircut?); and further into a decade changing faster than he is.With a fluid sense of time passing and a witty eye for the domestic props of the era Chase keeps an eye on the little things. In one scene a teenage party stops dead while Jagger on the TV spellbinds every girl in the rec room. Doug and his bandmates Eugene (Jack Huston) and Wells (Will Brill) wonder what they can do with that sort of sensual power. They wonder if theyll ever have a fraction of it. The movie cherishes the multidirectional pop and rock of the era and the soundtrack is terrific. Dougs father wants none of this world. Hes more comforted by a rerun of ""South Pacific"" than anything seen heard or dreaded in his own suburban middle-class Jersey home. James Ganldofini plays this part with supreme firsthand knowledge. The film to mixed results is narrated by Dougs younger sister Evelyn played by Meg Guzulescu. As Doug romances the exotic Grace (Bella Heathcote) he tries to be a Bob Dylan with a little Jagger a Kink or two and an ever-shifting version of himself. The bands struggles (Chase was in a band too once) give ""Not Fade Away"" its deliberately tricky tone both affectionate and a little sad.Dougs a bit of a cipher and if any one aspect of Chases film keeps it from being more than merely coolly engaging (which it is) its the casting. As scripted and as played by Magaro the entry point in ""Not Fade Away"" remains either a pleasant blur or a blank slate depending on your personal response contrasted by all the lovely details in the margins of Chases atmospheric krrraaanggg down memory lane.mjphillipstribune.comNot Fade Away -- 3 starsMPAA rating R (for pervasive language some drug use and sexual content)Running time 152Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Entertainment Music Not Fade Away (movie) Movies Mick Jagger Touch of Evil (movie) Dean Martin Best movies of 2012 Worst movies of 2012 10 movies to see over the holidays Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising75deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-1224-not-fade-away-20121228,0,5406098.column",200,notfadeaway11,notfadeaway,chicagotribune

(Barry Wetcher / Paramount)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Dec. 27 2012 Not Fade Away (out of 4) Starring John Magaro Jack Huston Will Brill Bella Heathcote and James Gandolfini. Directed by David Chase. 112 minutes. Opens Dec. 28 at major theatres. 14A TheSopranosdirector David Chase takes a basement view of the birth of Americas 60s rock revolution with his big-screen debut Not Fade Away. Although he gives credit for the spark of inspiration to the Rolling Stones -- recreating the first meeting between a blues album-toting Mick Jagger and an already-cool Keith Richards in an effective scene -- its wannabe rocker teens from New Jersey who carry the torch. The nostalgic look back is set to a killer soundtrack pulled together by executive producer and former Sopranos cast member Steven Van Zandt. The story is a simple by-the-numbers coming-of-age tale one that will be familiar to anyone who lived through those times especially the hopeful legions who formed ragtag bands and struggled to master three-chord rock n roll in basements and garages. Suburban Jersey teen Douglas (John Magaro) joins a burgeoning rock band formed by his high school buddies Gene (Boardwalk Empires Jack Huston) and Wells (Will Brill). Hes the drummer and backup vocalist for overbearing Gene and doesnt mind his place in the order of things doing covers of Top 10 hits at parties while making earnest pronouncements about the transforming power of music. Douglass perpetually weary store-owner dad (Sopranos star James Gandolfini) reacts predictably as his son starts to reflect the revolutionary times. Hes not the first father who shipped his clean-cut kid off to college in the 1960s and got a cocky album-toting Bob Dylan lookalike back at Thanksgiving. Douglas even manages to hook up with the much-admired hot girl (and some might be tempted to interpret that as movie wish fulfillment). Gorgeous sophisticate Grace (stunning Aussie Bella Heathcote of Dark Shadows) urges Douglas to start singing lead vocals -- a promotion thats hastened by an unfortunate accident with a glowing roach end and a toilet-paper roll. Family tensions with dad and his bitter catastrophizing mom (Molly Price) only make Douglas more certain of his blurted dinner-table assertion that his real family is the band. But as anybody who has tried to make that kind of kinship work knows cracks soon appear. Gene is hardly happy with taking a backseat to Douglas who is also pushing the band to start working on original material to pad Stones covers set lists. As many a rock anthem has explored Grace comes from the good side of town with a conservative hard-drinking ad exec father trading barbs with her unstable artist sister (Dominique McElligott) at the tension-fraught dinner table. Not Fade Away owes much to pleasing performances from Magaro and Gandolfini who verbally spar about everything from Cuban heels to haircuts and theres a welcome bit of business where the first echoes of punk invade a lonely Hollywood street. And the hits just keep on coming.

The protagonist is a schnooky Italian-American teenager kid named Douglas (John Magaro) who grows his hair into a curly mane like Dylans takes up the drums and is suddenly handsome. With three friends of differing abilities and personality disorders he forms the Twylight Zones named for his favorite TV show which carries the message he says that nothing you think is true is true. Their first gigs in smoke-filled basements full of beer-swilling teens are rough (they only do covers) and colored by Douglass intense longing for a tall drink of water named Grace Dietz (Bella Heathcote) whom he watches neck with other boys. But when he takes over the vocals from the swellheaded bellower Eugene (Jack Huston) Grace is impressed and the band finds its groove. So does the movie for a spell.At this years New York Film Festival Chase (who created The Sopranos) was asked if hed considered doing Not Fade Away as an HBO or other network series and he said the thought hadnt occurred to him. That makes sense. The Sopranos was tightly plotted with an epic structure. Not Fade Away is a mood piece. Its a dream of the sixties sustained by music both the Twylights gigs and numbers on TV by the Stones Bo Diddley James Brown and others. The soundtrack features Robert Johnson and Leadbelly. Steven Van Zandt is an executive producer and put the actors through their paces with their instruments. They convinced me they were a band. They also convinced me they needed to put in a lot more time to be great one.The structure is odd. Not Fade Away is bookended by a dramatization (in black and white) of Mick and Keith meeting on a train and an infectious frug by Douglass little sister played by the adorably gawky Meg Guzulescu. (She narrates the overture and epilogue.) These bits are wonderful but dont click into place and Chase jumps from year to year with no preamble the syncopation leaving too many gaps. But I didnt care much. Magaro is thoroughly winning; James Gandolfini has several affecting scenes as Douglass brutish father who is suddenly fragile and infused with regrets; and Will Brill is vividly weird as a rich boy alternately engaging and backstabbing. Dominique McElligott carves out a small tantalizing space as Joys sister -- the free-spirit druggie thief artist who probably didnt survive the era.The film ends abruptly with a shrug in L.A. at the start of another era both for the country and Douglas. Time to catch another wave. But Chase has captured this one for all time. He delivers on the movies title.

By Peter Rainer Film critic December 21 2012 Save for later Saved James Gandolfini stars in Not Fade Away. Paramount Vantage/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Video Not Fade Away (Trailer) Monitor Movie Guide David Chase the creator ""The Sopranos"" and one of the seminal figures in television history makes his feature film directing debut with ""Not Fade Away"" a semi-autobiographical coming-of-age drama set in New Jersey in the 60s. Its a ""personal"" movie that in some ways seems impersonal. Everything seems a bit too varnished and staged and overly familiar.Doug (John Magaro) who lives with his little sister (Meg Guzulescu) and blustery parents (Molly Price and James Gandolfini) has dropped out of college to make it big with the rock band he started in high school. He also has a work-in-progress relationship with well-to-do girlfriend Grace (Bella Heathcote) which is emblematic of the class consciousness that suffuses this story. Chase works in a lot of pop references - Dougs group covers the Rolling Stones and the Kinks - and some of his cultural remembrances have a lovely glow. (Doug admires the music of Leadbelly too.) But everybody tries too strenuously to summon up the past while giving it the immediacy of the present. Gandolfini though is a standout as the old-school father who cant abide his new-style son (but loves him anyway). Grade C+ (Rated R for pervasive language some drug use and sexual content.)

(PARAMOUNT) Doo-wop was urban - four or five kids hanging out on a steamy street corner. Rap was urban - teens calling each other out in rhyme dancers spinning on a square of cardboard. But classic rock came from the `burbs. What other place had spare rooms basements garages? You need space (and forgivingly thick walls) to start a band. You need room. And you dont find that in a cramped city apartment. Its one of the many things that ""Not Fade Away"" - David Chases tribute to `60s rock rebellious youth and expanded-ranch New Jersey - gets right including its characters raw yearning for authenticity. Its white hero talks a lot about the blues - especially awkwardly to the old black man he works with. Much to his confusion the fellow prefers easy listening. Which annoys Douglas because hes desperate to understand where this music comes from. But the same middle-class privilege that separates Douglas from the music also ironically gives him the means - a guitar a drum kit some spare time - to copy it and claim it as his own. And maybe someday to sing something thats really his own. That urge to express yourself is something its director understands. Chase has wanted to make a movie for 40 years; it was TVs ""The Sopranos"" that finally gave him the power. But it also burdened him a bit How do you get past old fans expectations? Chase makes the move gently bringing some of ""The Sopranos"" with him. So there are scenes of Jersey sub shops and angry Italian-American family dinners. And James Gandolfini shows up too as a fiercely traditional father gorging on ice cream in front of the TV. But this is not a mob story. Instead its a mod story - of how in 1964 bands like the Beatles the Rolling Stones and the Kinks started showing up on American airwaves. And how a generation of geeky kids washed the Brylcreem out of their hair bought electric guitars at Sears and copied them. That they were copying white British musicians who were themselves copying black American musicians just made the irony richer. There are some things Chase misjudges slightly. He introduces a narrator - and then mostly forgets about her until the movies end. He also overplays some of the family strife; Molly Price always threatening to kill herself rarely makes the mother much more than a joke. But John Magaro is excellent as Douglas who goes away to college comes back with a Bob Dylan `fro and a taste for grass and is never going to be the same again. Bella Heathcote with her huge grave eyes is a perfect pin-up as his dream girl Grace. And while Gandolfini may seem like a cliched Archie Bunker at first - with warnings to his kid that ""you and me were gonna tangle"" - theres a scene towards the end as the camera holds on his face while he watches ""South Pacific"" that hints at so much more. But then thats a musical moment and its music that really rules here. Chase is clearly a classic three-chord rock guy; the nuggets he unearths (with the help of offscreen music director Steve Van Zandt) are a greatest-hits roundup of British Invasion songs. Yet what makes this movie unique is that its not just one more story of a band that got big in a hurry. Douglas and his friends quarrel too much to agree on any direction; their managers best advice (basically pay your dues for awhile) leaves them horrified. Work practice wait - what does that have to do with rock-n-roll they wonder? Well a lot actually. And whether or not Douglas or any of his bandmates are going to make it in rock-n-roll or anything else is left completely unresolved by the end of the movie. But one thing is clear - theyve left their old lives behind. And its only because grungy garage-band rock which could only happen in the neat clean suburbs has somehow delivered them to the great big dirty wonderful city - and adulthood at last. Ratings note The film contains drug use strong language sexual situations and violence. Not Fade Away (R) Paramount (114 min.) Directed by David Chase.

Yes theres a great blues-and-rock soundtrack assembled by his erstwhile Silvio Steven Van Zandt. And the film certainly nails the nitty-gritty details of its time period -- roughly bookended by the assassinations of John Kennedy in 1963 and his brother Robert five years later. But theres not much to get excited about in this rambling quasi-autobiographical tale of Doug (John Magaro) a teenager who lives in suburban New Jersey with his dad (James Gandolfini) housewife mom (Molly Price) and a little sister (Meg Guzulescu) who oddly delivers the voice-over narration. Dad who runs a Pep Boys auto-supply store gets bent out of shape when the newly longhaired Cuban-heeled Doug -- inspired by the Rolling Stones hence the films title -- decides to drop out of college. Doug wants to devote his time to a garage band hes formed with his buddies and fellow Rolling Stones wannabes lead singer and guitarist Gene (Jack Huston) and the affluent Wells (Will Brill). The narration tells us at the outset that their dreams of rock stardom will never be realized so there isnt any suspense on that front. The groups -- and the films -- high point comes when Gene pulls an idiotic stunt during a concert that obliges Doug to take over and deliver a rousing rendition of ""Time Is on My Side. The acting is OK but none of the leads has the kind of sizzle that might have turned this into something as special as another film set roughly in the same era ""Diner. Nor this years ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower for that matter. Bella Heathcote (""Dark Shadows) who plays Genes underwritten love interest is loved by the camera in a way the guys just arent. Given the Garden State setting poor Gandolfini is haunted by the ghost of Tony Soprano as Magaros bellicose dad -- more than in any of his other screen roles. For someone whos spent his entire adult life in Hollywood Chase surprisingly falls into a frequent trap for first-time filmmakers -- including clips from classic films like ""Touch of Evil and ""Blow-Up. Such homages are always well-meaning but in this case they have the effect of making ""Not Fade Away look like a mopey piece of nostalgia by comparison. One of the biggest WTF endings since the ""Sopranos finale sure doesnt help.

Barry Wetcher/Paramount Pictures hide caption toggle caption Barry Wetcher/Paramount Pictures Not Fade Away Director David Chase Genre Drama Running time 112 minutes Rated R for pervasive language some drug use and sexual content With John Magaro Brad Garrett Christopher McDonald Basically Not Fade Away is the saga of a 1960s teenager who plans to become a rock star but slowly realizes he wont. The movie is set mostly in the New York suburbs. So why does it open in South London where two lads -- you may know them as Mick and Keith -- bond over imported blues LPs? The answer is that writer-director David Chase after working in TV for almost four decades wants his first movie to be both sweeping and intimate world historical as well as autobiographical. That ambition could have been as stirring as the films soundtrack assembled with care by Springsteen guitarist Steven Van Zandt once a cast member of Chases The Sopranos. Alas Not Fade Away is far less pungent than the period it attempts to evoke. The main story begins in 1964 as the dowdy American media introduce the new British rock. Working-class high-schooler Douglas (John Magaro) hears ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" on the radio and is transformed. Even more stunning are The Rolling Stones -- often heard but never glimpsed again after that prologue. Their potency is undiminished by having to endure Hollywood Palace host Dean Martins mop-top jibes. Douglas becomes a drummer and starts a group with several friends; they play Bo Diddley Stones and Kinks covers at parties where Douglas gazes longingly at Grace (Bella Heathcote) who may be too pretty for him and is definitely too rich. A year later college and longer hair have made Douglas cooler and when he moves from drums to lead vocals Grace notices. They begin a relationship that will survive several upsets and perhaps all the way to the movies open-ended conclusion somewhere in the vicinity of Hollywood and 1968. i Grace Dietz (Bella Heathcote) and Douglas discover the highs and lows of young love. Barry Wetcher/Paramount Pictures hide caption toggle caption Barry Wetcher/Paramount Pictures Grace Dietz (Bella Heathcote) and Douglas discover the highs and lows of young love. Barry Wetcher/Paramount Pictures With her 60s bangs and timeless cheekbones Heathcote resembles the beauties photographed with the likes of Jagger and McCartney in the Swinging London days. But her shallow decorative role as The Girlfriend is as outmoded as Dean Martins banter. Music drives the movie and the producers popped for the real stuff Robert Johnson Moby Grape and -- curiously -- the Sex Pistols are all here. The soundtrack is so overstuffed that it relegates Beatles and Dylan tunes to the end credits. Chases scenario integrates a few genuine music-biz insiders (such as songwriter Jerry Ragovoy impersonated by Brad Garrett) and includes an original number written for Douglas group by Van Zandt. (Its no ""That Thing You Do."") Finally the movie suggests the presence of another more infamous character from the era. Shoehorned around the a-star-isnt-born plot is another whole movies worth of family stuff. At Douglas house theres tension with a dad (Sopranos mainstay James Gandolfini) who doesnt want the times to be a-changin as well as a mother-daughter tampon discussion so odd it be must a genuine Chase family memory. At Graces more upscale home her parents plot to institutionalize their other daughter one of several traumas the movie cant quite assimilate into its nostalgic tone. Eventually Douglas concludes that hes more interested in directing than in singing. Hes always been a Twilight Zone fan -- an underdeveloped motif in a movie whose working title was The Twylight Zones -- but now he and Grace are watching Welles A Touch of Evil and Antonionis Blow-Up. But not apparently anything by Godard who used to stitch 60s culture and politics into invigorating experimental cine-essays. Not Fade Away is considerably more stolid revealing Chases grounding in TV. It has flashes of 60s spirit but enough plot for a miniseries and the sensibility of a period dramedy.

"Movie review Not Fade Away grooves on 60s in coming-of-age drama - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsReview Not Fade Away grooves on 60s in coming-of-age dramaDavid Chases film follows the ups and downs of a budding rock musicians career in a spot-on flashback to the 1960s era music politics and cultural issues.December 20 2012|By Gary Goldstein Its with David Chases much-honored individualism in mind that one should best approach a and best enjoy a his first feature film as a writer-director the wonderfully immersive and evocative ""Not Fade Away."" Despite the nostalgia-drenched idealism coursing through it a and a cinematic familiarity to the subject matter a this is not a story thats neatly told or safely predictable.The result though proves a warmly reflective diligently crafted and confidently digressive flashback to a time a place and people Chase the creator of ""The Sopranos"" knows like the back of his hand (as its largely drawn from the filmmakers own coming of age). ""Not Fade Away"" is a stirring snapshot of America from 1963 to 1968 and the many rock n roll thrills cultural and political watersheds and whirling emotions that erupted in between.Its also deviously smart and darkly funny.AWARDS Oscars 2013Chases proxy here is Douglas Damiano (John Magaro) a low-key New Jersey teen whose drum-playing with a local garage band formed during the heady advent of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones supersedes his academic ambitions much to the chagrin of his old-school dad (James Gandolfini) and sad-sack mother (Molly Price). The couples apoplectic reaction when college freshman Doug returns for Thanksgiving break in de rigueur grown-out hair peacoat and Cuban-heel boots is priceless.That not-so-welcome home foreshadows things to come as Doug looking increasingly like he just jumped off a Bob Dylan album cover will eventually leave school to pursue his rock n roll dreams a locally that is. This means juggling the conflicting creative agendas and cloudy impulses of his fellow band members including the self-important Gene (Jack Huston) and the navel-gazing Wells (Will Brill). But with Dougs soulful vocals usurping longtime friend Genes frontman status and Wells so clearly out for No. 1 any lasting unity is elusive.Then theres the comely Grace (Bella Heathcote) a daughter of conservative country clubbers and sister to erratic artist Joy (Dominique McElligott) who turns on to the long-smitten Doug once he reveals his singing chops (if that sounds clichA(c)d it doesnt play that way). Grace is the pre-hippie dream girl accessibly gorgeous pseudo-deep and slyly adventurous. Shes also a next-big-thing kinda gal which Doug is all too aware of.Best of 2012 MoviesA |A TVA | Pop musicA |A JazzThe story zigzags through these rebellious years keeping us fully invested in Dougs personal and artistic journey as life presents him aand those around him a with various setbacks and possibilities. Suffice to say the musician and film buff ends up where he belongs while at the same time closing an important circle.Chase and his collaborators get the period details here painstakingly right never falling into kitsch or excess. From the TV and film clips vehicles and furnishings to the fashions language and attitudes (not to mention a ""Mad Men""-worthy amount of cigarette smoking) viewers who were around in the 60s a or just groove on the era a should revel in the wall-to-wall bits of authenticity.Music however is the boss here and it infuses the pictures every nook and cranny in vivid intoxicating ways. Starting with a clever segue from an old Emergency Broadcast System signal into the strangely congruent opening riff of the Stones ""Satisfaction"" this is a film that knows a great songs power to move and inspire (no shock considering Chases savvy way with music on ""The Sopranos"").Dougs band gigs (the actors do their own swell performing) are vibrant and fun covering hits of the day as well as a foray into original tunes (Steve Van Zandt a the films music supervisor and executive producer not to mention a ""Sopranos"" actor and E Street Band mainstay a wrote the memorable ""St. Valentines Day Massacre"" well-utilized here in a first-rate band audition scene).The jammed and jamming soundtrack contains an inventively eclectic mix of rock pop and blues with the films use of the Rascals ""I Aint Gonna Eat Out My Heart"" the surf-rock instrumental ""Pipeline"" and perhaps most unexpectedly ""Bali Hai"" from ""South Pacific"" among the many musical highlights.Best of 2012 Video Games | Art | Theater | AwesomeChases finely chosen cast is uniformly spot-on with Magaro in his first major lead deftly carrying the film with an appealing combo of hangdog hotness and unfussy self-possession.As for Gandolfini he brings a touch of the old Tony Soprano temper to his blue-collar Pat but otherwise cuts an enormously affecting figure; a man who rails against a but is clearly envious of a his young sons burgeoning free spirit. Pats restaurant-set confessional to Doug is a heartbreaking seesaw of wistful candor and reflexive armor.Oscar take notice.calendarlatimes.com PHOTOS AND MORE VIDEO The making of Argo Les Miz and more The Envelope Awards Insider PHOTOS NC-17 movies Ratings explained MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESSpying the seasons offeringsNovember 3 2012David Chase recognizes value of perspiration in Not Fade...October 9 2012Sopranos creator David Chase rocks on with Not Fade AwayOctober 7 2012Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-not-fade-away-review-david-chase-20121221,0,2434382.story",200,notfadeaway18,notfadeaway,latimes

Director David Chase. (152) PG-13 Drug use language. Area theaters. Mood is more important to ""Not Fade Away"" than anything but writer-director David Chase who turned mood into masterpiece with every season of ""The Sopranos"" allows nostalgic feeling to be the sole reason for this his first feature film. John Magaro stars as Douglas first seen in the early 1960s as a gawky New Jersey teenager pining for a way to be cool. The Beatles and the Stones have turned music upside down. Douglas son of a blue-collar beer barrel of a father Pat (James Gandolfini) and a mother forever at the ironing board has a poetic ear and early Dylan frizz-fro. Along with a pal (Will Brill) he decides to start a band. Achingly awkward when they first play basement parties the band gets better once Douglas takes over vocals one fateful night. From there its infighting and alliances possibilities and the constant pursuit of a record deal all set against changing styles increasing freedoms and Douglas family staying set in their lower-middle-class Clifton home while Douglas and Grace (Bella Heathcote) the girl he loves defiantly do their own thing. Needlessly told as a remembrance by Douglas hero-worshipping younger sister (a sweet Meg Guzulescu) ""Not Fade Away"" has several moments that while straight from the band bio-pic playbook still come off as charmingly genuine. And Gandolfini keeps enough to himself that its a pleasant jolt when he reveals some emotion. But he and Chase have obviously developed a shorthand. The rest of the cast isnt as lucky. Magaro grows into his role allowing the older Douglas a confident diffidence that stands apart from his early scenes. Brill Heathcote and Guzulescu however arent given a note to aim for and so end up giving performances that trail off. What doesnt disappear so quickly is the movies musical layering which comes courtesy of another ""Sopranos"" vet Steven Van Zandt. The E Street Band member makes sure our ears arent bored. From lesser-known 60s songs to the original composition Douglas band plays when it comes time for their Big Break Van Zandt makes killer choices. ""Not Fade Away"" would fade away even faster without them. Magic moment A demo session catches magic.

Good thing he brought James Gandolfini along for the trip.

Fate disguised as failure intervened and DeCesare eventually became known as a writer-producer for The Rockford Files as the creator and guiding light of The Sopranos and professionally as David Chase. All this time though Chase husbanded memories of his early manhood the aches and epiphanies the family tensions and pretty girls and of course the songs. He hatches them in his first feature Not Fade Away. Chase is 67 now but the movie has the raw artless tell-all feel of a twentyish writers first novel -- a disgorging of the good-bad old days in the transparent mask of fiction. For admirers of Chases achievement in turning The Sopranos into one of the zestiest most impressive TV epics Not Fade Away is likely to be a big disappointment. (FIND The Sopranos on the All-TIME Best TV Shows) The blurred black-and-white TV image of a New Jersey rock group Joey Dee and the Starliters performing ""The Peppermint Twist"" is interrupted censoriously by a sign reading ""Please Stand By."" The emergency-warning beep accompanying the message gives way to the opening bass line of the Rolling Stones ""(I Cant Get No) Satisfaction"" -- Chases clever visualizing of the Plato observation cited later in the film that ""When the mode of the music changes the walls of the city shake."" That certainly applies to the walls of the suburban New Jersey homes that teenage Douglas (John Magaro) shares with his truculent dad Pat (James Gandolfini) and exasperated mom Antoinette (Molly Price). Doug in solidarity with many kids of all generations believes hes a prisoner of conscience in a Stalinist gulag where his parents serve as the uncaring guards. The emergence of the Beatles and the Stones allows him to express his protest as a fashion statement -- poodle hair and Cuban heels -- which suit his status as drummer for a local band called The Twylight Zones that includes lead singer Eugene (Jack Huston) and guitarist Wells (Will Brill). (SEE TIMEs Top 10 Best Movies of 2012) Movies have provided stories of bands that hit the top (Backbeat about the formation of the Beatles) and of one-hit wonders (Tom Hankss That Thing You Do). Not Fade Away as Dougs kid sister clues us early in the films fitful voiceover narration is about a group that became a no-hit wonder. The members practice they play a few gigs they debate who should be lead singer. Doug goes off to college -- which he father complains is costing him 2000 a year -- and finds an ideal snuggle partner in Grace (Bella Heathcote the moon-eyed Australian lovely from Tim Burtons Dark Shadows). Many screenwriters of less than hunky aspect like Woody Allen have paired their screen selves with dreamy girlfriends; and Grace is exactly that wish-fulfillment goddess in a grubby milieu. The prize daughter of a wealthy WASP family Grace is frankly too good for Doug and too pretty for Jersey. Actually the Twylight Zones are a no-hit no-wonder since theres not much musical distinction in their cover versions of Rolling Stones covers of American blues songs and zero chemistry among the bandmates. Magaro -- who is going for the 1965 Bob Dylan look but more closely resembles the Stones bass guitarist Bill Wyman -- gives viewers little reason to watch him except that hes the movies main character. Huston the grandson of director John Huston and a recurring player on Boardwalk Empire attracts the eye with his Jimmy Fallon vibe but never sparkles. In fact no one in the band seems to be having a great time. They bend to their work or what they call their art like wage slaves on a North Korean assembly line. (SEE TIMEs Top 10 Worst Movies of 2012) The one scene of musical magic in the movie (which is named for a 1957 Buddy Holly song revived seven years later by the Stones) comes from a clip of the Stones on a 1964 episode of Hollywood Palace when Mick Jagger coos Willie Dixons ""I Just Want to Make Love to You."" In that moment Jagger parades the danger showmanship and bisexual startle that made people want to watch the Stones. And not the Zones. The challenge for the teller of any story set in the 60s is to overcome the familiarity of the time; even those who didnt live through the decade have had its signature events moments and music drummed into their brains. Matthew Weiner the Sopranos producer who created Mad Men mostly avoids the period italicizing on that 60s show. Chase though thinks everyone needs to be reminded that national leaders were killed and that young men went to Vietnam also to die. Aside from the plush carpet of 60s songs (chosen by Steven Van Zandt the E Street Bandsman and Sopranos cast member) Not Fade Away takes the laziest way of evoking the past name-dropping and TV clips. The tragic heroic journey of African-Americans through the decade is clumsily encompassed in one black man a fellow ditch-digger on Dougs day job who talks of Martin Luther King and the other troubles that hes seen and Doug only sings about. (LIST Find Buddy Holly and the Rolling Stones on the all-TIME 100 Songs) The young actors never experienced those woes or those of the people they play. They spend most of their times semaphoring their emotions with cigarette flourishes worthy of Bette Davis and trying futilely to creep into their characters. For all the research they must have done studying 60s moods and mannerisms they cant persuasively inhabit the period; they only counterfeit it. The past this particular past is a foreign language theyve learned phonetically. That leaves to the adult actors the job of bringing to life the characters they play. Gandolfini who this month has prime supporting roles in Zero Dark Thirty and Killing Them Softly as well as the Chase movie is utterly convincing as Pat -- and not just because most of us lived with Tony Soprano and his family (and his Family) on 86 Sunday nights over eight-and-a-half years. An Italian-American store owner who sometimes badgers his son with sitcom-dad lines (""You n me are gonna tangle my friend"") Pat has come to realize that middle age is the time when dreams and illusions die. In a brief wordless scene he is alone stringing lights on the family Christmas tree; one string shorts out and his sigh suggests that this is the lives of grownups. When father and son finally powwow at a dinner for two Pat pours out his molten heart; yet he can barely command Dougs attention. If only this dad could put his declarations in the form of a guitar solo... (READ James Poniewozik on the end of The Sopranos) Maybe Chase wants to point out the selfishness of the young their obsession with breaking free their love of precisely those things that their parents hate. In that case the movie should have brought some definition uniqueness to Doug. One adult tells him ""Youre a walking cliche"" but Chase doesnt feel obliged to bring the truism to pulsing life. Thats what makes Not Fade Away painful and not in a good way. A glimpse into the 60s should give us not just the warm bath of recognition but the shock of the new as least as it felt in days of old. That doesnt happen in a movie that evokes less empathy than apathy. Many observers of todays popular culture -- and I include film critics -- believe that most movies dont come close to matching the drama power and ambiguity of the best TV in its series form. (For their desert-island DVD discs theyd probably choose Homeland Season 1 over Zero Dark Thirty.) The saddest thing about Not Fade Away is that it provides more evidence for the prosecution. The film had me wishing that Chase-DeCesare would put down his rock-star reveries and go back to doing what he did better than almost anyone make great TV.

In the case of writer-director David Chases remarkable feature debut the story is deceptively simple Its a 60s-set tale of a two-bit rock band started by Douglas (John Magaro) a small-town New Jersey youth in the wake of the British Invasion. Yet from frame one the film proves immeasurably more substantive. One of the first things we see is an emergency broadcast system test pattern its eardrum-shattering tones bleeding into the intro from the Rolling Stones ""(I Cant Get No) Satisfaction."" Its a thrilling and instructive juxtaposition that establishes the narratives center-cant-hold sense of cultural upheaval reveling in a literally offbeat point of view one that Chase cultivated on The Sopranos and expands majorly on here. As in the best episodes of that seminal television series Not Fade Away resembles less a straight drama than an ellipsis-heavy daydream. Chase jumps confidently through seemingly mundane occurrences in Douglass life--first love with his neighbor Grace (the ethereal Bella Heathcote); heated arguments with his overly practical father (James Gandolfini); and a variety of minor successes and major setbacks. Every scene plays with an in-the-moment vividness far removed from nostalgia-laden sentimentality; even the simplest interaction feels like it echoes through eternity. But it isnt until the story reaches its fancifully abstract final passages where cinema displaces music as Douglass weapon of choice that Chases reverie reveals itself as a particularly exceptional exploration of how art ceases being an idle hobby and becomes an obsessive vocation.

Credit Barry Wetcher By Peter Travers December 18 2012 More News Not Fade Away Director Reveals Film Poster All Stories >> You expect a hot dose of bada-bing what with David Chase creator of HBOs groundbreaking crime drama The Sopranos making his feature debut as a writer-director. Instead Chase offers a gritty graceful salute to rock amp; roll. Like Douglas (John Magaro) his films protagonist Chase grew up in suburban New Jersey in the 1960s playing covers of Buddy Holly and the Stones in his garage. Unlike Douglas Chase never went farther than his garage. But the impact of the music the way it opened doors to a larger world that embraced TV film politics and renegade social change never left Chase. His love for the period permeates every frame. More News Not Fade Away Director Reveals Film Poster All Stories >> Douglas and his bandmates Eugene (Jack Huston of Boardwalk Empire) and Wells (Will Brill) vie for the attentions of Grace (a luminous Bella Heathcote) and they comically and touchingly prepare for a fame that never comes. Home from college Douglas debates his old-school father (a splendid James Gandolfini) who hates his Dylanesque hair and Cuban heels. Later at a restaurant when Dad confesses to an affair and a possibly terminal illness father and son make a connection that is more heart-piercing for being so tentative. Chase shows a natural a ffinity for actors who are uniformly excellent. The awkwardness comes in letting some of the stories breathe at the expense of others suggesting something lost in the cutting. The music expertly curated by Steven Van Zandt is in the films DNA. Watching Antonionis Blow-Up at a theater with Grace Douglas complains about the lack of scoring in a silent park scene. ""The trees are the music"" Grace tells him. She knows the secrets that lie in the spaces between words and music. So does Chase. His ardent acutely observed debut makes him at 67 a filmmaker to watch.

Music not only serves as the subject but informs the very fabric of ""Not Fade Away"" David Chases savvy 60s-set feature film debut. Aided immeasurably by his keen ear for dialogue Chase filters a suddenly tumultuous transformative decade through the restrictive prism of conservative suburbia in this story of a New Jersey boys coming of age as political instability class awareness and rock n roll break in waves over the still-inchoate consciousness of several friends trying to form a band. Though starless save for James Gandolfinis knockout supporting perf this dynamic pic should resonate with auds countrywide upon its Dec. 21 release. ""Not Fade Away"" injects the past with the nervous energy and exciting uncertainty of the present devoid of nostalgia or biopic baggage and infused with all the wicked wit that characterized Chases ""The Sopranos"" and his bygone standout episodes of ""The Rockford Files."" The move from TV to a theatrical canvas is mirrored in the pictures very conception presenting the New Jersey microcosm as no longer a self-contained unit. Still the film rarely leaves its setting where Doug (John Magaro) lives with his looming disapproving father (Gandolfini) his quasi-hysterical mother (Molly Price) and his little sister (Meg Guzulescu) who supplies voiceover narration and performs a wonderful curtain-dropper to boot. Macrocosm first meets microcosm when Doug returns to Jersey from college sporting longer hair Cuban heels and anti-war indignation quitting his studies to devote himself to the rock band he started in high school. Chases writing shines in this intricate relationship between world events and their impact on the everyday Drawing from his own decidedly more lackluster experience as a band drummer the writer-helmer surrounds Doug with friends whose talents are not necessarily congruent with their ambitions and whose class differences manifest themselves erratically. Thus after lead singer/guitarist Gene (Jack Huston) temporarily knocks himself out by swallowing a lit joint Doug takes over as vocalist wowing the local crowd with his rendition of ""Time Is On My Side"" a glamorous position he soon assumes permanently to Genes ongoing resentment. Meanwhile well-off Wells (Will Brill) wrestles with the philosophical implications of imminent fame always worrying theyll ""lose the mystique"" theyve built up with their barely existent fanbase. The group covers the Rolling Stones the Kinks and Bo Diddley with varying degrees of fidelity but ""Not Fade Away"" pointedly refuses to follow either a difficult-road-to-success or downward-spiral-to-failure scenario. Instead the music feeds off surrounding chaos anchoring Dougs existence and coloring snapshots of various stages of his youth. His questioning whether to go for a more melodic or bluesier vocalization while listening to Leadbelly equates to his deciding on different attitudes toward life. Even movies and TV shows are defined through their music ""The Twilight Zone"" announcing its presence to the protag through its signature theme while ""Blow-Up"" confounds him with its silence. Dougs evolving relationship with wealthier girlfriend Grace (Bella Heathcote) forms the films other throughline and like his interaction with certain band brothers brings up issues of economic disparity. But Chase excels at diverting attention from the obvious and foregrounding the particular as in how Dougs cramped kitchen contrasts with Graces Toulouse Lautrec-wallpapered rec room where his band plays parties. And when Doug is shown digging ditches at Graces country club the scenes focus stays completely on Dougs failed attempt to musically bond with Lander (Isiah Whitlock Jr.) a conservative black co-worker who only likes church music. The young thesps play their characters interestingly as socially inept with varying levels of self-assertion and intellectual pretension. Magaros Doug maturing in fits and starts contrasts strikingly with Gandolfinis brilliant turn as a father undergoing a late-blooming epiphany. Chase often matches and sometimes even betters Cameron Crowe or Floyd Mutrux in granting present-tense immediacy to the rock n roll on the soundtrack never smothering it with hindsight. In this endeavor he was undoubtedly greatly assisted by exec producer/music supervisor Steven Van Zandt.

Not just anybody mind you but the middle-aged guy with the bad dye job a few tables away from us in the Library Bar of the Regency Hotel. ""Hiya"" bellows the dye job into his phone. ""Im sittin here watchin the overtime? You watchin the overtime?"" Then minutes later ""Hello Paul Its Jerry Hey Im in your favorite town Beautiful"" Finally a pause during which Chase and I try to remember what the hell we were talking about.Thats right on this recent Saturday afternoon we were discussing Not Fade Away (opening December 21) Chases debut feature as writer-director and the first Chase project of any kind to emerge in the five years since The Sopranos his landmark television series ended its run. For weeks he has been shuttling between the coasts on the long and winding Oscar campaign trail where Not Fade Away is nothing if not a dark horse a modestly scaled coming-of-age story done with a minimum of canned nostalgia and a maximum of lived-in feeling starring a cast of mostly unknowns with nary a goombah in sight. Its a small gem with a killer rock soundtrack well worth seeking out amid all the awards-season Sturm und Drang.Set in Chases native New Jersey Not Fade Away traces the ups and (mostly) downs of four high school friends who form a band during the seismic cultural spasms of the 60s the years of Chases own adolescence. The central figure is Douglas Damiano (played by newcomer John Magaro who resembles the young Bob Dylan) a shy Italian-American teen who begins as the groups drummer and when fate intervenes steps up to the mic with an inspired rendition of ""Time Is on My Side."" What follows is that rare movie about trying but failing to hit it big--ideal subject matter perhaps for a writer who spent 25 years toiling in network-TV obscurity before making his name with a bona fide pop-culture phenomenon.Chase too once drummed sang and played bass in a garage band that never quite made it out of the garage though he has mixed feelings about the ""semiautobiographical"" label that has been stuck to Not Fade Away since its premiere this fall at the New York Film Festival. ""It didnt happen in this order; it didnt happen in that place"" says the 67-year-old filmmaker a compact nattily attired figure who might be mistaken for a banker or a lawyer. ""But the feelings of it are real and the major events of it are kinda true.""Chase looks like hes about to say something else when a familiar voice interrupts ""Hey whats going on Im in New York Are you in Florida yet?""""This fuckin guy"" Chase says. ""Hes driving me crazy. Should we move?""We tuck into a banquette at the opposite end of the bar and Chase proceeds to tell me about the one film that changed things for him that made him start thinking about movies as something more than mere entertainment. It was Cul-de-Sac (1966) Roman Polanskis Beckettian black comedy about two criminals who take refuge in the beachfront castle of an effeminate Brit and his sexually frustrated wife. Chase saw it while an undergrad at New York University. He recalls ""Maybe because there were only four characters and it never really left that castle it was the first time that I thought Somebody made this movie. One guy made this movie. And it looks like that could be something really interesting. Maybe I could do that.""He soon set down his drumsticks and headed west to film school at Stanford where he directed a 30-minute thesis project about a man who dreams of becoming a gangster. ""Its amazing when I look back on it"" says Chase who saw the film again recently. ""The seeds of The Sopranos are all right there."" He then made his way to L.A. with his wife Denise and began working as an all-purpose assistant for Clover Films a soft-core pornography outfit looking to break into the horror-movie business. Asked to write a script about a vampire whose half-human son rebels against his bloodsucking lineage he happily agreed and though he claims little of his work made it to the screen its tempting to see the film Grave of the Vampire (1972) as early evidence of Chases signature theme the fraught relationships between parents and children.It was another Chase script--one hed written while still a student--that gave him his Hollywood break after one of his professors passed it along to Roy Huggins the TV writer-creator (Maverick The Fugitive) then serving as a vice president at Universal. Huggins hired Chase to write a series episode on spec and the rest is history. For two decades Chase found himself in high demand as a TV writer eventually joining the staffs of Kolchak The Night Stalker Hugginss own The Rockford Files and later the acclaimed Northern Exposure and Ill Fly Away. But he couldnt get himself arrested in the movie business. Unproduced feature scripts (including an early version of The Sopranos) piled up in proportion to Chases mounting professional frustration.The Sopranos changed all that. It was TV still but TV conceived in purely cinematic terms by turns surreal and absurdist and wholly devoid of the audience hand-holding de rigueur at the networks. ""I was trying to make a movie and I couldnt so I tried to make a movie on television"" Chase says. ""And that was the directive that every episode would be a small movie."" He takes a sip from his second orange juice of the day. ""I didnt want to tell you what you were going to see show it to you and then tell you what youve seen"" he says. ""This was maybe the radical aspect of the show I said If they dont get it thats too bad.""It was also by Chases own admission a hard act to follow. When the series came to a close he took a year off and lived mostly in France (where he owns a house in the countryside near Dordogne) not writing but thinking a lot about his next act. Not Fade Away was one of the ideas that began to stir during that time. He started writing in 2008 and ""it just took a long time"" including a lengthy postproduction period in which Chase realized he had more story than he needed. (The film was first announced as a fall 2011 release.)""The thing about it is now that Ive been through this process I feel like nothing is good enough"" says Chase whos eager to make more films but clearly remains his own harshest critic. ""The target is so small that the editor in me--or the studio executive in me--has just taken over completely saying Thats not right because . . . Just getting up to the plate is so rare that when you get there youve got to knock it out of the park. Hitting a single or a double? Forget it. Everybody has to hit a home run. And what kind of ideas can stand up to that kind of scrutiny? These are wisps. Theyre little notions.""sfoundasvillagevoice.com Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Scott Foundas Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

David Chases feature film debut ""Not Fade Away"" is so affectionate toward its chief subject - the allure of 60s rocknroll and its capacity for both shaping and messing up lives - that you might be tempted to look away from its numerous flaws. Still those flaws creep to the fore and refuse to be banished The picture which plays the New York Film Festival this Saturday feels like a three-part miniseries shoehorned into one nearly-two-hour morsel - theres too much going on in it for anything to have much weight. The movies saving grace or perhaps its crutch is that its dotted with sound clips from the Beatles the Stones the Kinks. Even The Left Banke has its moment. Whenever the dramatic momentum starts to sag or go all squirrelly a scruffy Ramp;B rave-up or Bo Diddley beat appears handily to distract us. In ""Not Fade Away"" John Magaro plays Douglas a scrawny high schooler growing up in suburban New Jersey. The movie opens in the early 1960s at approximately the same time Mick Jagger and Keith Richards across the pond were just starting to trade Jimmy Reed records theyd ordered by mail from Chicago. (Chase dramatizes their first meeting in a brief opening scene shot in mists-of-history black-and-white.) Douglas an aspiring drummer gets a chance to sit in with a band thats been put together by some of his classmates (Jack Huston and Will Brill). He has eyes for a pretty classmate (Bella Heathcote who somewhat resembles 60s supermodel Jean Shrimpton at least as much as any mere mortal could) but it never occurs to him that he might have a chance with her. Meanwhile it turns out shes wondering why he never talks to her. Douglas goes off to college an opportunity his working-class dad (James Gandolfini) has toiled hard for. He comes home for a break with long hair and a peacoat a development that displeases his father no end. Later when he zips up a new pair of Beatle boots dad refers to them as ""high heels."" When Douglas informs his father indignantly that theyre Cuban heels he shoots back predictably ""You wanna wear Cuban heels go live in Cuba."" Douglas and his father will eventually reconnect but in the 60s nobody wanted to cozy up to his or her parents. And Douglas has much to learn about life love and the music business This isnt a rags-to-riches story so much as an aimless exploration of what it supposedly meant in the 60s to find yourself. ""Not Fade Away"" shows moments of life when its not working desperately to hit all the important 60s hot buttons (the assassination and funeral of JFK Viet Nam war the Civil Rights Movement) none of which it hits in any satisfying or meaningful way. Chase made a name for himself shaping six seasons of ""The Sopranos"" but a movie is a different beast Theres alternately too much here and not enough and Chase who also wrote the script fails to give most of the characters any significant shading. (For example one young woman is institutionalized by her upper-crusty straitlaced parents and its not clear whether shes actually crazy or just a nuisance to them; worse yet we hear nothing more about her fate after shes carted away.) But ""Not Fade Away"" does offer a few strokes of brilliance moments that capture the way lightning could strike with just the merest twist of the radio dial. Magaros Douglas is gangly and unappealing in the movies early scenes; later he becomes a scruffy-sexy swan by tapping into the kind of bedhead cool pioneered by Bob Dylan. Chase finds a terrific way to pinpoint the moment that transformation is set in motion We see the very young Douglas dozing and then stirring into a half-awake state. Someone in another room is playing a radio and the sound thats streaming out is clearly unlike anything hes ever heard unlike anything anyone has ever heard. Its ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" and he makes his way toward the sound in a trance. ""What is that"" he says but theres no question mark at the end of his sentence. He has already accepted that magnificent song as his destiny accepted the certainty that it will change his life forever. With ""Not Fade Away"" Chases heart is in the right place; its a shame he keeps losing the beat.

Loaded with clips of TV hits and rock singles to supplement the struggles of a college-age Jersey kid looking to get out ""Not Fade Away"" is easy on the eyes and ears but light on new ideas. Its a period piece composed of familiar pieces none of which have much to say beyond surface elements that have been explored countless times before. Using a typical coming-of-age mold Chase turns cultural ephemera into formula. A personal ode to the seismic change taking place in 1963 writer-director Chases story centers on disgruntled New Jersey college kid Doug (rising star John Magaro whose enthusiastic performance bodes well for his future) an afro-laden rock junkie constantly adorned in sunglasses whose aspirations cull from the successes of Bob Dylan the Rolling Stones the Beatles and virtually every other popular group of the time. He wants to hit it big with style much to the chagrin of his hardworking blue-collar father (James Gandolfini) who casts a discouraging gaze on Doug in virtually every scene they share. Meanwhile Doug joins forces with a trio of likeminded wannabe rockers (Brahm Vaccarella Jack Huston and Will Brill) to start a band eventually wrestling his way to the frontman role and romances a soulful local girl (Bella Heathcote). Basically Doug chases his dreams grasping for a piece of the celebratory atmosphere of the countercultural revolution taking place far beyond the bland suburban world holding him down. For the first act the tension moves along with an attentiveness to the characters plight that provides an immediate reminder of the detailed portraiture that made ""The Sopranos"" such a profound achievement. But Chase had years to build out the atmosphere and central dramas of that show whereas ""Not Fade Away"" struggles to make its conflicts as real as the setting. Black-and-white television screens blaring newspaper headlines and samplings of hits from the time (selected by Steven Van Zandt the films credited music supervisor) constantly underscore the energetic ingredients inspiring Dougs expectations for himself but they never coalesce into anything substantial. Instead much of ""Not Fade Away"" unfolds in an episodic manner that begins in the immediate aftermath of the JFK assassination and follows Doug as he drops in and out of college while his bands dynamic grow uglier and his relationship becomes strained. Chases writing skills are evident in individual exchanges but the pacing suffers from a randomized feel Here another argument with his parents; there some aspirational chatter with the band; rants about Vietnam and nuclear paranoia abound. At least Van Zandts soundtrack provides a lively atmosphere to sustain the collage. Dovetailing into the summer of love ""Not Fade Away"" seems more committed to covering a lot of ground than saying anything new with its subject matter. Dealing with a period currently fetishized on ""Mad Men"" (created by former ""Sopranos"" scribe Matthew Weiner) the movie competently reassembles the time but fails to root it in engaging drama. Inexplicably narrated by the lead characters younger sister -- presumably meant to resemble yet another generation the early stirrings of punk as indicated by a coda involving the Sex Pistols -- ""Not Fade Away"" grasps to provide a grand tribute to the American youth experience but cant match its enthusiasm with a similarly engaging purpose. You can get swept up by the details and appreciate Chases willingness to put them on full display but his wistfulness never reaches a deeper function. The movie is less an homage to early 60s identity crisis than a late-to-the-game example of it. Criticwire grade C+ HOW WILL IT PLAY? Paramount Vantage releases ""Not Fade Away"" on December 21. While it may receive a decent reception at the New York Film Festival and other festivals where its set to play the movie will have a harder time gaining commercial ground. Its awards-season prospects are largely tied to whether or not voters find Chases screenplay emotionally compelling enough to deserve singling out.

TWITTER John Magaro Bella Heathcote and James Gandolfini star in The Sopranos creator David Chases debut feature a music-infused personal reflection on growing up in the 1960s. NEW YORK - One of the many attributes that made The Sopranos such epically great American television was its idiosyncratic use of music. So its both unsurprising and entirely fitting that for his first feature the creator of that series David Chase has made a movie not only stacked with inspired music choices but fundamentally about the formative influence of music on a generation. Its also appropriate that Not Fade Away takes its title from a song popularized by Buddy Holly and by The Rolling Stones. This deeply personal reflection on growing up in the 1960s captures a shift in rock n roll that had its roots in the transition between those artists - a revolution that continued rippling through the broader culture in the decade that followed in ways both concrete and intangible. The film may be too meandering for mainstream acceptance but its focus will make the Paramount Vantage release connect directly with many baby boomers. Its also a warm funny poignant scrapbook that evokes a spirit of youth still relatable in later eras. (Watch the trailer here.) Movies about bands such as The Commitments Backbeat That Thing You Do Control and The Runaways tend most often to chronicle the formation the early struggles or the rise and fall. The efforts of a group of friends in the comfortable New Jersey suburbs to break out of their garages and into the music industry are a large part of Chases film. But that story is more of a canvas for a gently reflective coming-of-age drama providing a vague kinship with Cameron Crowes Almost Famous. More than that however Not Fade Away is a richly contextualized snapshot of changing social dynamics examining the conflict between traditional values of security and stability and the restless hunger for creative fulfillment. Politics and the civil rights movement are part of the movies backdrop but its depiction of the fumbling search for personal and artistic freedom is shaped as much by pop culture. Books movies television and especially music supply the juice here dipping into everything from The Twilight Zone to Antonioni. Drawing directly from Chases youthful experience as a drummer in a Garden State band the central character is Douglas (John Magaro). He plays covers of Bo Diddley the Stones and the Kinks at local parties in a group led by his friends Gene (Jack Huston) and Wells (Will Brill). While Douglas shoots dreamy-eyed glances at high-school beauty Grace (Bella Heathcote) she seems to be more jock-inclined. That changes when lead vocalist Gene has to skip a gig after swallowing a lit joint and Douglas steps in proving himself the superior singer. Along with ferment in the band the film also follows Douglas uneasy relationship with his blue-collar Italian-American family typified by a hilariously tense Christmas dinner. Magaro looks at times uncannily like a young Bob Dylan and when he comes home from college with a mop of curls a pea coat and Cuban-heeled boots his depressive mother (Molly Price) shakes her head in disgust while his father Pat (James Gandolfini) says he looks like he just got off the boat at Ellis Island. When Pat is diagnosed with cancer the pull is felt to bring Douglas back into the family fold. But Chase is less interested in that conflict than in the wistfulness with which hardass Pat comes to view his sons exploratory steps toward self-discovery and the regrets of his own life. Gandolfini plays these realizations with affecting subtle strokes notably in one particularly lovely moment set to the unexpected strains of ""Bali Hai"" from South Pacific. It might be argued that Chase dilutes his focus by digressing into the troubles of Graces well-heeled conservative family concerning her unstable artsy sister (Dominique McElligott). But this serves to push Grace and Douglas back together after a rift and also to illustrate more tragic manifestations of the WWII generations fear of change. Theres a loose collage quality to the storytelling with extended intimate exchanges interspersed among short scene fragments. This suggests that while Chase is moving into features he is not abandoning the unhurried pace and ample breathing room of long-form television. Its a welcome unconventional touch that the guiding voiceover - for once used with refreshing economy - doesnt come from the obvious source of Douglas but from his kid sister (Meg Guzulescu). She observes from the sidelines until stepping into center-screen in a wonderfully odd coda that hints at the next transition to come. The film is more driven by tone and texture than performance but the characters are all sharply drawn with an affectionate embrace of their flaws among them Hustons resentful egomaniac Gene and Brills philosophizing Wells. Magaro plays the rebellious side of Douglas as well as his burgeoning sense of self in appealing low-key mode. And Australian import Heathcote who showed promise in Dark Shadows reveals a more immediately captivating delicacy here. Cinematographer Eigil Bryld provides a deft balance of grit and gloss in the visuals matched by the scrupulous yet understated attention to period detail in Ford Wheelers production design and Catherine Marie Thomas costumes. Some images will make anyone who lived through the era laugh out loud such as a room full of girls languidly puffing on cigarettes staring transfixed and intoxicated at a Bamp;W television as Mick Jagger sings ""I Just Want to Make Love to You"" on Hollywood Palace. Chases Sopranos paisan Steven Van Zandt serves as music producer curating an eclectic selection of vintage tracks that rigorously avoids the obvious. (The deployment of Tracy Nelsons haunting vocals on Mother Earths ""Down So Low"" is genius.) Van Zandt also wrote a terrific song titled ""The St. Valentines Day Massacre"" to serve as Douglas and Co.s first foray into original material. It has more than enough kick to feed the melancholy undertow when their career plans dont pan out.
