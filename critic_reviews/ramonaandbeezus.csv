Joey King (in mirror) and Selena Gomez are ""Ramona and Beezus."" Share Print Save to your profile By Roger Moore McClatchy Tribune News Service7/21/2010 Editor rating 2 Its so sentimental and sweet that you can almost forgive the kids comedy Ramona and Beezus for not being funny enough. This adaptation of author Beverly Clearys beloved 1950s novels about ``Ramona the Pest her sister Beatrice (Beezus to her) and her life in the same world that Henry Huggins and his dog Ribsy inhabit emphasizes childhood conflicts confusion and emotions over slapstick -- no great sin. But the movie takes too long to settle on that tone and blows more than a few laughs along the way. Ramona (Joey King cute as a button) shares a room with the sister shes always called Beezus (Selena Gomez well cast). Beezus isnt shy about mocking her sisters fears -- monsters under the bed for instance. The 9-year-olds got a vivid imagination. Hanging from a swing she sees a vast canyon below. But shes undaunted. ``Its good to scare yourself once in a while is her motto. Contractors building an addition to her house are a cause for celebration school projects are opportunities to show off problems between mom and dad can be smoothed over if she just takes over the cooking. Peopling Ramonas world are her droll seemingly humorless teacher (Sandra Oh -- spot on) her parents (John Corbett trying too hard and Bridget Moynahan) and her favorite Aunt Bea (Ginnifer Goodwin of Big Love). But Aunt Beas old beau played by the effortlessly charming Josh Duhamel is back. Ramona worries shell be ``reeled back in like a bass. That possible romance takes center stage for much of the movie suggesting that director Elizabeth Allen (Aquamarine) was a lot more at home with the mushy stuff than with a little girls antics. First love between Beezus and Henry Huggins also earns more screen time than is warranted in a movie with Ramonas name first in the title especially since they changed the title of the source novel from Beezus and Ramona. There are more laughs in the average episode of Gomezs Wizards of Waverly Place TV show than in this. But the movie gamely wrestles with topical ``growing up matters -- unemployment life-altering decisions. Allen gives the movie heart and heft even if she never quite develops a taste or a grasp of the funny stuff. Cast Joey King Selena Gomez John Corbett Ginnifer Goodwin Sandra Oh Josh Duhamel. Director Elizabeth Allen. Screenwriters Laurie Craig Nick Pustay. Based on the novel by Beverly Cleary. Producers Denise Di Novi Alison Greenspan. A 20th Century Fox release.

But if Ramona herself never grew up multiple generations of readers grew up reading about her taking solace in the literary evidence that they were not alone in their awkwardness. It seems odd then that its taken this long for anyone to make a big-screen adaptation of the books. (There was a short-lived Canadian television series in the late 80s.) And its curious that rather than starting at the beginning and attempt to kick-start a franchise the producers of the film have opted to condense as much material as possible from the eight books into a single film. Theres an upside to that. Fans of the books should enjoy seeing some of their favorite Ramona moments from across the Cleary bibliography recreated here squeezing an entire tube of toothpaste into the sink pulling the golden curls of the classs stuck-up pretty girl failing hilariously in an attempt to become a commercial actress throwing up in front of her class when she gets the stomach flu. But the film never feels as scrappy or rough-edged as its inspiration. Ramona is played by newcomer Joey King with the right blend of clumsiness frustration and defiance and director Elizabeth Allen playfully renders Ramonas frequent imaginative flights of fancy in periodic daydream sequences. Yet everything feels a little too cleansed even when Ramona is making a mess of things. The central thread of Laurie Craid and Nick Pustays script is drawn from 1977s Ramona and Her Father which deals with Mr. Quimby (John Corbett) losing his job -- as relevant a story for 2010 as it was in the late 70s. For a main subplot the writers blend in elements of 1984s Ramona Forever which features Hobart Kemp (Josh Duhamel) the globetrotter uncle of Ramonas best friend and next-door neighbor Howie (Jason Spevack) and his return from his travels to woo Ramonas Aunt Bea (Ginnifer Goodwin). Drawing major plotlines from two different books and trying to combine them with set pieces from six others however makes for a manic pace and episodic feel. There are only so many embarrassing incidents you can shoehorn into the compressed timeline of a 104-minute story even if Ramona is the prototype for klutzy kids. i Its Raining Women The ladies of the Quimby clan -- Aunt Bea (Ginnifer Goodwin far left) Beezus (Gomez center) Dorothy (Bridget Moynahan far right) and Ramona (King) get caught in a backyard water fight.

Alan Markfield/Twentieth Century Fox Spending so much time on Ramonas antics also leaves little time for her older sister Beezus (Selena Gomez). Despite her title billing Beezus doesnt get much to do here apart from getting annoyed with her sister and fawning over longtime friend Henry Huggins. But the often thorny relationship between the sisters is handled with an honesty that approaches the authenticity of Clearys vision. That honesty about the difficulties both large and small of being part of a family is what Ramona and Beezus does best even if the rough and dangerous edges have been filed down to maintain a G rating. Clearys books have endured in part because the author didnt pull punches whether with regard to the Quimbys financial woes Ramonas fathers unemployment and search for some direction in his life or the simple day-to-day annoyances of living with people who sometimes get on your nerves. The film is too frenetically paced and clean to quite recreate the magic of their source material but it does often face these issues in the same admirably head-on fashion.

Director Elizabeth Allen Release Opened Jul 23 2010  Editorial Review Sisters anyone could relate toBy Dan KoisFriday July 23 2010Those among you who feel protective of your favorite childhood books may be a little nervous about the new film adaptation of Beverly Clearys beloved tale of sisterhood ""Beezus and Ramona."" Specifically you might be nervous because the title of Elizabeth Allens film which features Selena Gomez is ""Ramona and Beezus."" Is it not enough that the simple treasures of our childhood must be made into callow commercial movies starring Disney Channel icons? Must they bastardize their titles too? Anyway relax. Ramonas name comes first because this thoughtful movie is not an adaptation of that quaint novel which after all was published in 1955 and featured an awful lot of scenes of Mother baking cakes and crying ""Oh my goodness"" ""Ramona and Beezus"" knits together scenes and themes from all eight of Clearys Ramona Quimby novels into a sweet and funny if slightly overlong portrait of life on a modern-day Klickitat Street. Ramona (the cute but not-too-cloying Joey King) is 9 and has a real knack for getting into trouble. Shes not trying to; its just that shes brave and imaginative and sometimes things get a little out of hand and the next thing you know shes cracked a raw egg on her head on Picture Day. Her sister Beezus (Gomez sharing the spotlight well) is in high school and is therefore exasperated by Ramonas antics especially when the pest starts a kitchen fire just as a boy calls on the telephone. ""Ramona and Beezus"" of course is about how sisters love each other despite all the upsetting things that happen to them. And plenty of upsetting things happen to Ramona and Beezus. Their dad (John Corbett) loses his job; a handsome neer-do-well (Josh Duhamel) starts courting their lovable Aunt Bea (Ginnifer Goodwin); they even in a plot twist that some parents of hysterical children might decree overkill bury a beloved pet. But if the movie piles an awful lot of misfortune on Ramonas head it also never talks down to her -- or to the kids Ramonas age who despite the studios attempts to appeal to tweens are likely to make up ""Beezus and Ramonas"" chief audience. The screenplay by Laurie Craig and Nick Pustay understands how frustrating life can be for a 9-year-old who doesnt know why everything she says makes the adults crack up. ""Were not laughing at you honey"" Ramonas dad says at dinner while everyone laughs at her for expressing her anger with a ""very bad word"" (""Guts""). Allens direction is bright and imaginative; particularly enjoyable are the movies occasional flights of fancy as when Ramonas leaps off a low ledge are transformed into well-animated parachute jumps through the clouds. Allen benefits from an extremely game cast from her two pint-size leads to the adults all of whom are both unashamed to look silly and unafraid to deliver legitimately emotional moments. Particularly appealing are Goodwin and Duhamel whose easy rapport creates an unexpectedly satisfying grown-up romance in the midst of all the little-kid shenanigans. So little girls and their parents will certainly like ""Ramona and Beezus."" (Though they all might squirm a little at its 1 hour 44 minute running time.) High-school girls will like it too if they can get past the little-girl trappings. Boys? Its an accepted truth in Hollywood these days that boys wont watch a movie with girls in it but I and every boy I knew read the Ramona Quimby books when we were kids. I cant think of a good reason why any 9-year-old boy wouldnt relate to Ramona and her problems -- which after all have very little to do with being a girl and quite a lot to do with being very little.

Ramona Pint-size star will rebound from forgettable Ramona and Beezus BY JOE WILLIAMS  Post-Dispatch Film Critic gt; joewilliamspost-dispatch.com gt; 314-340-8344 Jul 23 2010 (...) 20th Century Fox John Quimby (John Corbett) enjoys an enthusiastic welcome home from daughters Beezus (Selena Gomez left) and Ramona (Joey King). Remember the name Joey King.Thats not some crusty old Vegas comedian but the pint-size star of ""Ramona and Beezus."" As the misfit middle child of a Portland Ore. family the kids a natural and shes likely to be sticking around awhile.The same cant be said for the movie which is so friction-free that it slips from memory before the credits fade. Although its based on the first book in a beloved series by Beverly Cleary (""Henry Huggins"") that debuted in 1955 ""Ramona and Beezus"" is set in the present. So theres a potentially timely subplot about her father (John Corbett) losing his job and wondering whether to uproot his wife (Bridget Moynihan) and three kids to some scrubbier start-over locale. No problem declares spunky 9-year-old Ramona who opens a lemonade stand and then a car-washing service to stave off the bill collectors. This is one of those family flicks where every mishap -- a car covered in rainbow paint -- is an occasion for forgiving hugs.The books are built around the mostly love-sometimes hate relationship between imaginative Ramona and her adolescent sister Beatrice (aka ""Beezus"" played by Selena Gomez). But here that relationship takes a back seat to the economic uncertainty and to the romantic travails of Aunt Bea (Ginnifer Goodwin) and her carefree ex-boyfriend Hobart (Josh Duhamel). The divided focus is so fuzzy that we never get a clear sense of what makes Ramona so special. There are a couple of cute animated fantasy sequences but except for a limber pop-rock soundtrack (""Walking on Sunshine"" again?) theres little of the rubbery energy that propels kid-centric comedies like ""Malcolm in the Middle"" and ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid.""Still in Vegas theyre betting that Joey King will bounce back.

Katie Hewitt The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jul. 23 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Ramona and Beezus Directed by Elizabeth Allen Written by Laurie Craig and Nick Pustay Based on the books by Beverly Cleary Starring Joey King and Selena Gomez Classification G Before the curtain goes up on Ramona and Beezus the movie theatre is a playground - kids chase each other spill popcorn and wiggle in their parents laps. Then in a brief minor miracle all is quiet as we find Ramona Quimby (Joey King) a rambunctious 9-year-old hanging from a jungle gym in her schoolyard imagining a vast chasm beneath her. ""If you cant be brave at recess how can you be brave when it counts?"" she asks. A good sentiment and a cue that some serious challenges are coming Ramona is determined to save her house from something called ""foreclosure."" Shes pulled from her invented world into the reality of family finances summed up by her big sister Beezus (Selena Gomez) ""Have you seen the bills they get? Everything costs money - even water."" Parents Robert (John Corbett) and Dorothy (Bridget Moynahan) start arguing in hushed tones and the sisters prepare for life-changing results with age-appropriate guesses Beezus suspects they will move and Ramona imagines the bank will literally carry their house away. But the conflict seems subdued after sugary-sweet establishing scenes of their home where Ramona acts out a bad case of middle-child syndrome with among other antics emptying toothpaste into the sink. Her vandalism gets praise (""nice job on the toothpaste. Good grip"") from onscreen parental figures in soft focus. Yes the Quimbys seem destined to live happily ever after. Even the films lone antagonist Ramonas teacher Mrs. Meacham (Sandra Oh) is only wicked because she frowns on Ramonas invented words; she still has a heart beneath those conservative blouses. Director Elizabeth Allen with screenwriters Laurie Craig and Nick Pustay adapted the film from the eight-book Ramona series by childrens author Beverly Cleary. Until now Cleary 94 has kept a tight hold on her brainchild who dates back to the fifties. The film updates the early print stories with references to the Great Recession and a romantic interest for Beezus. Ramona is a big name but 10-year-old King wont disappoint diehard fans. She is never anything short of adorable yet brings a range of believable 9-year-old emotions to her character innocence betrayal grief embarrassment confusion helplessness envy and a mean temper tantrum. In most of the books big sister Beezus is barely a tween but shes cast in the movie as a high-school student - no doubt to wrangle Gomezs fan base into the same theatres as the wiggling tots. Despite her in-your-face Disney stardom Gomez is less of a distraction and more of a subtle and caring big sister. Fans fear not Ramona is still the star. The film tries to appeal to audiences of all ages and for the most part ""reels you in like a sea bass"" as Ramona would say. Onscreen romances span from high-school crushes to marriages. In the case of Aunt Bea (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Hobart (Josh Duhamel) its high-school sweethearts revisited. Most out of their teens will have a hard time believing that Hobart is a teenage rebel turned hopeless romantic. But whatever is lacking between the two is made up in their interactions with the kids - when Hobart comes running from the garden brandishing a shovel and feigning insanity Ramona goes running and screaming; hes a convincing kid at heart. As Bea and Ramona King and Goodwin have a younger-sister pact that all siblings can relate to. But its not the older (and it turns out none-the-wiser) couples who are most interesting. Its Beezus and her high-school friend Henry Huggins played by a perfectly awkward Hutch Dano. As the pair takes childhood friendship into their teens Beezus tries in vain to take private phone calls and is inevitably embarrassed by everyone related to her. Everything is end-of-the-world dramatic in her so-called ""love life."" Aside from being a ""pest"" of a little sister Ramona is a daddys girl. The books make Robert Quimby into a kind of superhero. But Corbetts Robert with his homemade sweatshirts cheesy dancing and egg-cracking on his head is at times a bit nauseating. Corbett (of Sex and the City fame) is oddly cast but still a lovable if dorky dad capable of saving the day. Anyway the adults - and their bills - are there primarily as foils for the misadventures of the children.

Almost everything she does leads to unmitigated disaster whether shes washing a guys Jeep or rolling a hard-boiled egg against her head. The Jeep suffers an accidental paint job and winds up looking like a Jackson Pollock; the egg not actually boiled conditions her hair on picture day. In both cases she takes the blame and feels humiliated. And in both cases -- this is key - it is Not. Her. Fault. Shes only a third-grader. She deserves better treatment fairer justice than she gets in Ramona and Beezus for no other reason than shes the best thing in it a rambunctious bright-eyed mighty mouse with a kaleidoscopic wardrobe and an imagination to match. Movies about girls are already few and far between; movies about girls who follow their own quirky drumbeats are even scarcer (and often hail from Sweden). In the title role Joey King is pitch-perfect prepubescent charisma being that rare child actor who comes across as an honest-to-God kid despite being a showbiz veteran since the age of 4. Not rooting for Ramona isnt an option and never was not since Beverly Cleary first wrote about the denizens of Portlands Klickitat Street - Henry Huggins Beezus Quimby and her annoying little sister - in the early 1950s. Adapted for the screen by Laurie Craig and Nick Pustay this new film ramps up the Ramona humiliation at the expense of the books light touch. The plot has less to do with 1955s Beezus and Ramona than 1977s Ramona and Her Father in which our heroine struggles to aid her newly jobless dad (played here by a wildly chipper John Corbett). Generally the 21st-century setting is unobtrusive and in tandem with Clearys novels - which took place in whatever time period she happened to occupy while writing them. Because this is the time of Disney pop stars big-sis Beezus is played by Selena Gomez. Her central role which she fulfills with gusto is to express twitchy sibling irritation while simultaneously pining for Henry (fellow Disneyite Hutch Dano). More mature brooding occurs between Ginnifer Goodwin as Aunt Bea and Josh Duhamel as Hobart the guy with the Jeep whose share of the script proceeds with alarming rom-com efficiency. (As Mama Quimby Bridget Moynahan snaps my favorite line ""I know life stinks but we still have to make the yard look good."" Truer words were never spoken.) In a nod to the original books Ramonas dad is a frustrated artist whose elastic and fidgety sketching resembles Alan Tiegreens classic illustrations. Another cute touch is the use of toyland fantasy sequences - mixing live-action Ramona with animated cut-outs and dollhouse figures - to capture a wee girls outsize imagination. Both the fanciful bits and the Jeep-defacing are brought to us by Elizabeth Allen a chronicler of mild modish girliness who also directed the teen-mermaid romance Aquamarine. With Ramona and Beezus shes delivered another innocuous film about another unusual girl but this time shes a mistreated imp with an irresistible grin.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post ""Ramona and Beezus"" has enough charm to forgive it an unnecessary foray onto romantic-comedy turf. It also has just enough heft about the economic challenges families face today to be taken seriously. Based on the novels of Beverly Cleary the G-rated outing is set in Portland Ore. where the lovely Quimbys of Klickitat Street reside. Robert (John Corbett) and Dorothy (Bridget Moynahan) Quimby have three girls who seem to confirm research about birth order. Newcomer Joey King is 9-year-old Ramona a sprite of great imagination who has a gift too for mishaps. Shes the heart of the story. Fifteen-year-old Beezus (Selena Gomez) is the type of eldest child who sets schoolteachers up for future disappointment. Shes an A student a lovely girl a responsible daughter. Wee Roberta Q. still in a high chair is a slurping and gurgling prop. You can see where this setup might lead. The often-carefree Ramona has worries about getting lost between her siblings Miss Perfect and Little Miss Utterly Dear. Fortunately for Ramona she has an ally. Ginnifer Goodwin portrays Aunt Bea herself a younger sister. Bea is wonderfully solid when recognizing her nieces mini-disasters as flights of open-heartedness. Shes more frazzled around Hobart (Josh Duhamel) the man who disappointed her long ago but has returned with hopes of ""catching up."" Directed by Elizabeth Allen and written by Laurie Craig and Nick Pustay ""Ramona and Beezus"" is a gentle sketch of life the way the young experience it. Ramona and best pal Howie (Jason Spevack) have adventures and the occasional misadventures. The film playfully depicts these goofball endeavors with effects that capture the makeshift nature of make-believe. Clouds are cotton-ball fluffy. Canyons are rough-hewn and roiling. As for self-assured Beezus shes noticing that her feelings for childhood best friend Henry (Hutch Dano) are evolving into a case of nerves. Then one day Dad goes to work as a marketing VP and comes home downsized. ""Ramona and Beezus"" handles this with an understanding of how families manage disaster. Parents have whispered conversations or muffled arguments as they forge a game plan. Dad tries to keep chipper and calm. Mom goes back to work while he hits the job circuit. Its an admirable finessing of a dilemma likely to resonate as reality or anxiety given the nations unemployment rate. Two summers ago the girl-targeted kid flick ""Kit Kittredge An American Girl"" set in the Great Depression undertook a similar task. A deeper better film it hewed to the upended life of its kid reporter and still managed to find a triumphal message. ""Ramona and Beezus"" cheats with a rom-com solution. Its not that the subplot of a beloved aunt reconnecting (or not) to her high-school sweetheart is bad. How can it be with the winning Duhamel portraying the guy trying to win back the girl? But the movie would be just fine better even if it belonged wholly to the sisters Quimby. ""Ramona and Beezus."" G. 1 hour 44 minutes.

Toy Story 3 anyone? Now its time to give Fox (and Walden Media) credit for doing right by Ramona and Beezus.Under the deft direction of Elizabeth Allen previously at the helm of the sweet low-key Aquamarine the characters from the beloved Beverly Cleary books come to life as a thoughtful script by Nick Pustay and Laurie Craig (also a screenwriter on the charming Ella Enchanted ) touches on sensitive issues such as job loss tight finances and parental quarrels without questionable language nudity or physically terrifying situations. Movie Information Ramona and BeezusRatingShowtimes | Official siteDirector Elizabeth AllenStarring Joey King Selena Gomez John Corbett Bridget Moynahan Ginnifer Goodwin Josh Duhamel Sandra OhRun time 104 minutesMPAA rating GSynopsis The beloved Beverly Cleary childrens books are brought to life. Grand Prairies Selena Gomez co-stars as Beezus.More movies from GuideLive.comIts always a challenge for actors to meet the expectations readers have in their heads. These performances offer pleasure throughout. Ten-year-old Joey King clearly a rising star brings natural charm to Ramona the exasperating color-outside-the-lines little sister of Beezus whose nickname stuck when Ramona mispronounced Beatrice.Grand Prairies own Selena Gomez 18 glows in every scene shes in from frustrated sister to comforting sister from mortified teen to a young teen in love.Most impressively The Wizards of Waverly Place star consistently supports Kings Ramona proving herself as much a true ensemble player as the fine adult cast which sparkles with John Corbett as Ramonas patient dad and Bridget Moynahan as her overwhelmed mom. Ginnifer Goodwin is her Aunt Bea who identifies with her; Josh Duhamel is Beas rakish love interest; and standout Sandra Oh plays Ms. Meacham the seemingly disapproving teacher who gets Ramona a whole lot better than Ramona realizes.Its been 55 years since Cleary wrote Beezus and Ramona (back when Beezus was supposed to be the main character) and 26 since she wrote Ramona Forever but this film was well worth waiting for. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

Credit Alan Markfield/20th Century Fox In ""Ramona and Beezus"" based on the Beverly Cleary childrens books about a pair of mismatched sisters growing up in Portland Ore. the focus is on the hyperactive grade schooler Ramona (Joey King) rather than the introspective teenager Beezus (Selena Gomez of ""Wizards of Waverly Place""). Having made that decision the filmmakers including the director Elizabeth Allen and the screenwriters Laurie Craig and Nick Pustay appear to have made another to put their energy into the frequent Nickelodeon-style scenes of mayhem and gross-out caused by Ramonas rambunctiousness -- involving paint peanut butter fire water and so forth -- rather than the somewhat glum connective tissue of family drama and romance.Children may appreciate that choice though they (and their parents) might not be so happy with the hour-and-three-quarters running time.Adults can appreciate the presence of Ginnifer Goodwin as charming as always as the girls Aunt Bea and Sandra Oh as Ramonas glowering teacher. The cast also includes John Corbett and Bridget Moynahan as the parents an oddly cast Josh Duhamel as Aunt Beas man-child love interest and Hutch Dano as Henry Huggins whose interest in Beezus may come as a shock to Cleary fans.Parents may also be happy to see a movie for children that doesnt involve wizards vampires or action figures that can be bought in the food court. They should be warned though that the price of contemporary realism is a story that includes layoffs bickering and unpaid bills.RAMONA AND BEEZUSOpens on Friday nationwide.

Its nice when a little reality is allowed to in trude into a family film. The current re cession drives the plot of the cute well-made ""Ramona and Beezus"" based on a series of juvenile-fiction novels by Beverly Cleary that have been beloved for more than half a century. Newcomer Joey King is funny and adorable as daydreaming 9-year-old Ramona Quimby who is constantly getting into jams at school and home while comparing herself unfavorably with her high-achieving teenage sister Beezus. Just when youre writing this off as another generic family flick Beezus dad (John Corbett of ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"") gets downsized and her mother (Bridget Moynahan) has to go back to work. Suddenly our young heroine (""Were going to be poor"") has to face bigger problems than messing up her hair on yearbook photo day. Money woes lead to parental squabbles mortgage problems and the possibility the family will have to move away from Portland Ore. The movie handles this with a relatively light touch (Ramona tries to sell lemonade to help out) but author Cleary who grew up in the Great Depression and is said to have insisted on supervising the script achieves an unusual level of reality for this sort of movie. Big sister Beezus is played by Disney Channel star Selena Gomez -- a box-office concession thats less than ideal but far less distracting than the filmmakers original choice Miley Cyrus. Beezus is provided with her own subplot -- she frets about losing her boyfriend in the threatened move. Ramona has her own pint-size admirer so yet another romantic subplot threatens to turn this into a family-friendly version of ""Hes Just Not That Into You."" This attempt to further expand the films demographic reach which belonged on the cutting-room floor and extends the running time needlessly also has Ramonas aunt (a criminally underused Ginnifer Goodwin) being pursued by a former sweetheart (Josh Duhamel) who dumped her in high school. Thats a relatively small complaint in a film as sweet and intelligently directed (by Elizabeth Allen who did the underrated ""Aquamarine"") as ""Ramona and Beezus."" Child actress King is a real find; plenty of kids will be asking for a sequel. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Will Ferrell launches Comic-Con with laughs Read Next Will Ferrell launches Comic-Con with laughs Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 43460 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 21100 16 feared dead in Texas hot air balloon crash 18381 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Ramona and Beezus A family film with a dose of reality | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesRamona and Beezus A family film with a dose of realityBeverly Clearys beloved childrens books get a 2010 overhaul while retaining all the charms of the young heroine.Bridget Moynahan John Corbett and Selena Gomez star in the engaging Ramona and Beezus.  (Alan Markfield / Associated Press)  By Jason AndersonSpecial to the StarFri. July 23 2010Ramona and Beezus(out of 4)Starring Joey King Selena Gomez and John Corbett. Directed by Elizabeth Allen. 103 minutes. At major theatres. G Though Ramona and Beezus occasionally invites viewers into the vibrant inner world of its 9-and-three-quarters-year-old heroine this sprightly new family flick is more remarkable for what it reflects about the real world than any imaginary one. All kinds of familiar worries and problems intrude upon the existence of the Quimbys the family that author Beverly Cleary first introduced to readers in the 1950s and would feature in such kid-lit classics as Ramona the Pest.Article Continued BelowIn this updated take on Clearys Ramona books the characters must cope with everything from job loss to sibling rivalry to the stirrings of first love to the death of a pet. Indeed things get so serious at times that when a water fight breaks out in Ramonas backyard you half expect someone to end up in an ambulance.Thats not to suggest the movies all doom and gloom just because Ramona and Beezus takes a more realistic view than most Hollywood family films would dare. Instead this is a lively affair largely thanks to the sweet and snappy screenplay by Laurie Craig and Nick Pustay and to the appealing performances by the cast.Joey King is especially charming as Ramona a young lady prone to elaborate flights of fancy that often put her on the wrong side of her teacher Mrs. Meacham (Sandra Oh) and her big sister Beezus (Selena Gomez).Sequences with deliberately low-tech effects reveal Ramonas sometimes fantastical perception of her adventures on the playground and at home with Beezus dad Robert (John Corbett) mom Dorothy (Bridget Moynahan) and infant sister in their house in Portland Ore. (Its actually Vancouver incognito -- amusing appearances by the great character actor Donnelly Rhodes and Nancy Robertson of Hiccups and Corner Gas add to the movies considerable amount of Canadian content.)Excitement over a home renovation gives way to a more uncertain mood when Robert is the victim of downsizing and Ramona takes it upon herself to contribute to the familys finances and cause less trouble for everyone. And while the wooing of the girls Aunt Bea (Big Loves Ginnifer Goodwin) by her old beau Hobart (Josh Duhamel) adds a bit of romantic intrigue to the household affairs it also points to other changes for the Quimbys.Though the story told here takes place in an obvious time of upheaval for Ramona and her clan its hard to miss the underlying implication that a constant state of flux is what passes as normal life for most families especially in times as uncertain as ours.Just as Clearys own childhood experiences during the Depression influenced aspects of her many novels for young readers the present economic circumstances have had a discernible impact on this movie adaptation. By allowing such notions to intrude upon its characters otherwise gaily coloured fictional universe Ramona and Beezus gains more real-world resonance than audiences may expect even if the movie bears less resemblance to the works of John Steinbeck than it does to a Family Channel sitcom.Breezy engaging and surprisingly perceptive despite its largely generic packaging it shows how much a family film can benefit from a dose of reality.

"Movie review Ramona and Beezus - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review Ramona and BeezusThe adaptation of Beverly Clearys childrens stories is sweet and sure-handed.July 23 2010|By Glenn Whipp Special to the Los Angeles Times ""No matter what my sister says Im not a pest"" insists 9-and-three-quarters-year-old Ramona Quimby (newcomer Joey King) at the beginning of ""Ramona and Beezus"" a sweet and sure-handed adaptation of the Beverly Cleary childrens book series. Big sister Beezus (Disney Channel star Selena Gomez) would likely take issue with Ramonas assessment ticking off a laundry list of ways that Ramona can be a bother. Sticking her with the nickname Beezus a Ramona couldnt pronounce ""Beatrice"" when she was smaller a undoubtedly would top the grievance list. Bunking together in a small bedroom doesnt help matters much either. But as the episodic ""Ramona and Beezus"" gradually unfolds we watch the sisters forge not only a truce but also an understanding of each other as young women negotiating their way through the thickets of childhood. Tenderness isnt a quality found much these days in the whirring-and-clanging busyness of family movies which makes this G-rated gems emphasis on emotion and heart all the more laudable. Author Cleary began the ""Ramona"" books in 1955 taking the character from a 4-year-old precocious tot through age 10 by the end of the eighth and final entry in the series. Ramona came off as courageous and independent but sometimes the bravado was just an act. Underneath she felt misunderstood and wanted the acceptance of her peers as much as the next kid."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""649"" height=""160""gt; The remarkably natural King captures the characters pluckiness and insecurities as she feuds with her seemingly perfect sister and endures one catastrophe after another at her grade school. (Picture day produces a particularly tragicomic disaster.) Home usually a source of sanctuary for Ramona is unsettled too now that her kind father Robert ( John Corbett) has been laid off from work. Roberts joblessness a and his debate about following money or his muse a is one of a few grown-up plotlines threaded through the film. Ramonas beloved Aunt Bea ( Ginnifer Goodwin) provides counseling to her favorite niece but finds her own wisdom wanting when it comes to knowing whether she should rekindle a romance with an old flame ( Josh Duhamel). The seriousness of these issues never threatens to dampen the movies sunny tone. With their optimism and can-do spirit the Quimbys own a passing resemblance to the Flanders family on ""The Simpsons"" but mostly in a good way. The parents are perfect but theyre not bumbling or bickering (much) either. Director Elizabeth Allen (""Aquamarine"") coaxes fine performances from her cast young and old stumbling only when relying too heavily on musical cues (Katrina amp; the Waves ""Walking on Sunshine"" needs to be permanently retired) and in the films awkward CGI flights of imaginative fancy. Other than that the movie is to quote its young heroine ""terrifical."" calendarlatimes.com"");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""649"" height=""110""gt; MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESLove Beezus and Ramona?

It boasts a daddy/daughter plotline that is very touching.Set in contemporary Portland Ore. but also in the timeless universe of family dynamics R and B is blessed with young actresses who resemble actual kids and not motormouth moppets on TV sitcoms.Beezus Quimby is perpetually irritated that Ramona steals her sunshine. Ramona is perpetually annoyed that she cant escape her sisters long shadow.As Beezus Selena Gomez (the Harriet Potterish teen on Disneys Wizards of Waverly Place) nicely plays an anxious high schooler a straight-A student exasperated by Ramonas hyperactive imagination. Ramona (Joey King refreshingly natural) feels bad because everything Beezus does is right and everything she does is wrong. Can this sisterhood be saved?Their sibling rivalry takes a back burner to bigger family issues. When Dad (John Corbett) gets downsized and Mom (Bridget Moynahan) can get only part-time work the sisters have to pull together despite the stuff that divides them. Will they lose the house? And have to move?Director Allen whose previous film was the uninspired mermaid saga Aquamarine tells the Quimbys story gracefully. She elicits remarkably honest performances from her younger stars.Ramona finds support in her sympathetic aunt (Ginnifer Goodwin) herself a younger sister who has grown up in the shadow of an older sibling.The overall tone of the film is sunny with Ramona and Beezus resiliently turning lifes lemons into lemonade. Dad may lose his job - but he finds his vocation. Ramona and Beezus may resent their differences but learn to treasure them - not as flaws but as strengths.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + One of the best things about watching your child learn to read is flashing back to all the books you loved as a kid and knowing youll soon get a chance to share them. For many parents at the top of the list of early favorite authors is Beverly Cleary.In a writing career that goes back 60 years the former librarian (now 94) has produced dozens of bestsellers chief among them a series of easy-to-read chapter books starring Henry Huggins and his dog Ribsy and a spinoff series starring Henrys Klickitat Street neighbors Ramona and Beezus. The latter pair -- volatile sisters six years apart -- are front and center in the new big-screen ""Ramona and Beezus a throwback dramedy every bit as wholesome as its source material.In all other ways though ""Ramona and Beezus the movie should not be confused with ""Beezus and Ramona the book.Since the filmmakers wanted an older Ramona (age 9 played by newcomer Joey King) and a teenage Beezus (played by Disney Channel pop princess Selena Gomez) they cobbled their story from Clearys later works sampling most heavily from ""Ramona and Her Father ""Ramona and Her Mother ""Ramona Quimby Age 8 ""Ramona Forever and ""Ramonas World. What results is a narrative that rings familiar -- Ramonas dad loses his job; comic mishaps ensue when she tries to bolster the family finances -- but will be hard for purists to place or warm to and that disconnect doesnt help an overly mannered adaptation in which the worst calamity is a car doused in house paint.King looks and acts like a Norman Rockwell-ized Ramona way too cute to deliver the spit and grit of Clearys female Dennis the Menace. Hers is a girl gone mild. Not that shes to blame. Screenwriters Laurie Craig (""Ella Enchanted) and Nick Pustay (nothing youd remember) have reached no higher than a ""Punky Brewster episode. Director Elizabeth Allen (""Aquamarine) struggles to define her movie -- not an easy task with vanilla Vancouver standing in for Portland Ore. and the action stranded in a generic era thats supposed to be timeless but only succeeds in being flavorless.Allens creativity shines through though in Ramonas literal flights of fancy the daydreams of a 9-year-old who imagines shes dangling over a canyon or soaring into outer space. The directors use of stop-motion animation delivers the personality that the rest of her movie doesnt. These brief episodes are intentionally crude like the artworks of a semi-talented child which isnt exactly original but is effective.The rest of the cast tries hard to achieve liftoff. Gomez makes a likable (if too model-pretty) Beezus so nicknamed when the young Ramona had trouble pronouncing the given name of her straight-A perfect sister Beatrice. Bridget Moynahan is convincing as the girls mom and John Corbett as the unemployed-but-ever-cheery superdad is at least less out of place here than he was in the desert quicksand of ""Sex and the City 2. Ginnifer Goodwin fans wont be surprised that shes too good for the part of Aunt Bea Ramonas mentor and ally who spends most of her time pretending she will not end up back with old flame Hobart (Josh Duhamel). Sandra Oh makes a superbly uptight Mrs. Meacham Ramonas secretly soft-centered third-grade teacher. Most disappointing Awkward entertaining Henry Huggins is reduced to a panting puppy dog (they couldnt find a golden lab so they cast Hutch Dano).Clearys books werent masterpieces. They were simple relatable everyday adventures that didnt talk down to their young readers. Her Ramona was messy unpredictable defiant and frequently unapologetic. Remember the most poignant plot point of ""Ramona and Her Father? It involved a stubborn daughters crusade to end her dads cigarette addiction no matter how humorless he became as a result. Thats far too scary a path for todays Hollywood family fare.This new Ramona prefers mischief without real edge. You always know her parachute has a silver lining even in an economic downturn. She is above all safe. And that makes her nowhere near as entertaining or enduring as the girl on the page.Janice Page can be reached at jpageglobe.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Beginning in 1950 Oregon-born author Beverly Cleary began penning stories about the inhabitants of Portlands Klickitat Street an idyllic suburban anywhereland home to a handful of recurring characters who starred in books like Henry And Beezus and Ramona The Brave. A former childrens librarian Cleary writes with gentle good humor that doesnt shy away from the confusion and occasional humiliation that comes from being a kid particularly a kid whose high spirits and overactive imagination makes her stick out from the pack. Generations of such kids have seen themselves in Ramona Quimby a rambunctious goodhearted troublemaker who moves to the big screen--alongside her older more responsible sister Beezus--for the first time in Ramona And Beezus. John Corbett and Bridget Moynahan co-star as the sisters parents whose easygoing approach to child-rearing gets thrown for a loop when Corbett loses his job. In the spirit of misguided helpfulness Ramona (Joey King) steps up with a series of schemes to save the family from the financial ruin and disintegration promised by one of her classmates. The film paces itself episodically to her get-rich-quick schemes as a pair of sweet courtships--one between Beezus (Selena Gomez) and a neighborhood kid another between aunt Ginnifer Goodwin and her estranged high-school sweetheart Josh Duhamel--play out behind her. Its a weird time to adapt Clearys books. Theyve aged well on the page but their sweet low-key tone makes them out of step with the sort of kids entertainment that tends to make it into theaters. (Its no accident that Cleary was chosen to pen some Leave It To Beaver novels in the early 60s.) So its tempting to praise Elizabeth Allens adaptation simply for not being an ADD-enabling spectacle along the lines of Robert Rodriguezs Shorts in spite of the handful of CGI fantasy sequences and its worth noting that Allen coaxes sweet performances from her leads particularly King who makes for a rambunctious-but-not-obnoxious Ramona. If only Allen had avoided making Klickitat Street look like Blandsville U.S.A. Ramona And Beezus has the undeniably nice pleasantly uninspired feel of film designed to kill time with the kids on a rainy weekend. As such theres nothing really wrong with it. But theres nothing amazingly right about it either unless of course it sends young viewers marching off to libraries to find the real Klickitat Street for themselves.

Comments click to enlarge Ramona and Beezus New Rated G  104 minutes  2010 Ramona Quimby the rambunctious schoolgirl of Beverly Clearys books finally arrives on the big screen after 60 years and aside from a few slapstick set pieces (most notably a car wash that leaves the vehicle covered in multicolored paint) this adaptation preserves the sense of everyday childhood thats made Cleary a mainstay of childrens literature. The movie is weirdly anachronistic with its gawky character names out of the 1950s (Henry Huggins Uncle Hobart Howie Kemp) and its soundtrack of 80s pop hits (""Eternal Flame"" ""Walking on Sunshine"") but that probably wont bother your eight-year-old. For the grown-ups there are sweet sincere performances by Ginnifer Goodwin Sandra Oh and as Ramonas endlessly game father the likable John Corbett relieved for once of his drippy rom-com duties.

(20th Century Fox) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday July 22 2010 400 AM Title Ramona and Beezus There are only two types of adults who will have any interest in seeing ""Ramona and Beezus"" those who cherish memories of the Beverly Cleary books on which its based and those who could use an air-conditioned break from babysitting. The former will be unimpressed but the latter ought to find exactly what theyre looking for.Lowered expectations in other words are the key to Elizabeth Allens feather-light family comedy. It wont change anyones world but itll keep kids happy - and cool - for a couple of hours.Though Disney star Selena Gomez is the obvious draw for tweens they may be disappointed to find that her Beezus is just a supporting character. The heroine is Beezuss sister Ramona (Joey King) a mischievous third-grader with an outsized imagination.While Ramonas parents adore their spirited daughter they dont have much extra patience right now. Dad (John Corbett) just lost his job which means Mom (Bridget Moynahan) has to work overtime while he runs the household. Ramona tries to be helpful but somehow every money-making scheme backfires causing more trouble for her family and teacher (Sandra Oh).The only one who seems to understand her in fact is her beloved Aunt Bea (Ginnifer Goodwin). Unfortunately ever since Beas old boyfriend (Josh Duhamel) came to town shes been increasingly preoccupied.Like Ramonas homemade lemonade the movies sweet and sour elements never quite blend the way they should. And Allen too often flattens Clearys edge into generic childrens fare.But Ohs amusing acidity cuts the cuteness while Corbett brings a comforting reassurance to the most stressful situations. (Credit goes to screenwriters Laurie Craig and Nick Pustay for approaching issues like unemployment and financial insecurity with calm honesty.) Most important King handles her heavy load well without indulging in excessive precocity.Still her character could be any Hollywood imp and bears little resemblance to Clearys lovable ""pest."" So the biggest adventure will begin when the movie ends - and you take the kids to the library where they can get to know the real Ramona.

"Ramona and Beezus Gentle sister act served with a spoonful of sugar - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Ramona and Beezus Gentle sister act served with a spoonful of sugarRamona and Beezus aa 1/2July 22 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticKnow how to give mild G-rated fare a little something special? Cast Sandra Oh as an elementary school teacher who enjoys her orderly ways and who regards the Ramona half of ""Ramona and Beezus"" taken from the venerable Beverly Cleary childrens books as more challenge than charmer. Ohs droll supporting turn as Ramonas third-grade instructor reminds us how much good a performer can do even when the material makes her work for it. Directed by Elizabeth Allen the film is darned if it does and darned if it doesnt. If a film of such unfashionable gentleness fares indifferently or worse at the box office itll only encourage the studios in the direction of the coarse the obvious and the "" Shrek."" On the other hand If ""Ramona and Beezus"" does find an audience its success can be framed as brand loyalty to Clearys originals."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""300"" height=""160""gt; Screenwriters Laurie Craig and Nick Pustay have cooked up a new scenario for Clearys familiar characters all living in the merry whirlwind generated by Ramona Quimby of Portland Ore. (Ramona and Portland are played by Joey King and Vancouver B.C. respectively.) Dad finds himself unemployed which threatens to uproot the clan. Beezus has boy questions not ""troubles"" per se but still. Ramona tries out for a commercial testing her ordinarily healthy self-esteem. The girls aunt is the object of a neighbors affections; he broke her heart once so she tells him she requires ""some sign of commitment"" from him before joining him in Alaska. Does the film end with a wedding? Do you think youll get that one out of me? King establishes a plausible push-pull chemistry with Selena Gomezs Beezus whose popularity and hair-care preoccupations contrast with her little sisters roughhousing. (Gomez played Alex on Disneys ""Wizards of Waverly Place."") The parents are played by John Corbett and Bridget Moynahan. Corbett is relaxed to a fault; Moynahan by contrast brings an unsettling air of smiling calm to nearly every scene. The movie is not bad but its not much. Also a bit of a spoiler (warning) but nonetheless At one point in ""Beezus and Ramona"" the father tells Ramona that the family couldnt stay together without her (""You really did save us kiddo"") and Im not sure how young children of divorced parents are going to perceive that sentiment. If its up to Ramona to keep the unit intact does that means it wouldve been her fault in story terms if shed ""failed""? Maybe not. But maybe. For the record Josh Duhamel brings some welcome exuberance to the role of the goofball suitor Hobart. Like Oh hes fun to watch. This is something never to be underestimated. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating G (suitable for all ages) Cast Joey King (Ramona Quimby); Selena Gomez (Beezus); John Corbett (Robert); Bridget Moynahan (Dorothy); Ginnifer Goodwin (Aunt Bea); Josh Duhamel (Hobart); Sandra Oh (Mrs. Meacham) Credits Directed by Elizabeth Allen; written by Laurie Craig and Nick Pustay; produced by Denise Di Novi and Alison Greenspan.

Ramona and Beezus Check movie showtimes Bad to fair Director Elizabeth Allen. Cast Joey King Selena Gomez John Corbett. Rating G. Related Movies based on bestsellers Maybe a kid ruining everything she comes into contact with including but not limited to trashing a neighbors car with paint destroying the back yard and FALLING THROUGH THE CEILING WHILE A REALTOR SHOWS HER FAMILYS HOME because she got mad and ran into the attic is really cute scruffy kid stuff. Oh isnt she adorable? No not really. As a parent all I could think of during ""Ramona and Beezus"" director Elizabeth Allens movie based on the popular series of Beverly Cleary books were things like ""How much must that cost to fix?"" Sure kids (and well-adjusted adults) might think oh how funny shes set the kitchen on fire trying to make dinner. And true enough shes trying to do the right thing. But she never quite gets there. And that gets old making ""Ramona"" wear out its welcome long before it should have. Which is kind of a shame. Joey King who plays Ramona is a plucky kid her rough charm the only thing that salvages the character (and no do-the-right-thing-by-accident bits tacked on toward the end dont suffice). Selena Gomez a Disney Channel star in her small-screen life is good as the exasperated-but-condescending older sister. And Allen even manages to get a performance out of John Corbett thats not smug and grating something that last happened hmm when? Never? Ramona Quimby (King) is a 9-year-old girl living in Portland Ore. with older sister Beezus (Gomez) parents Robert (Corbett) and Dorothy (Bridget Moynahan) and baby sister Roberta (Aila and Zanti McCubbing). High-strung and eager Ramona is basically a good kid who cant catch a break. This plays out in fairly obvious ways (the yearbook photo screw-up is always a reliable go-to disaster) for most of the movie. But in a nod to tough times theres more Ramonas dad loses his job. He gets to spend more time at home with the girls but it means Ramonas mom has to work more which leads to eventual anger and resentment on her part (kind of a weird message in a kids film). Its a time of incredible stress - the Quimbys are adding a bedroom to their house during all this - but that doesnt seem to bother Robert. His preternaturally calm attitude - a sort of white-collar version of the Dude in ""The Big Lebowski"" - makes you question his sanity or covet whats in his medicine cabinet. Meanwhile Ramonas Aunt Bea (Ginnifer Goodwin) is flummoxed by the return of her high-school sweetheart Hobart (Josh Duhamel) who wants her to go with him to Alaska. This is actually the most interesting relationship in the movie though for fairly obvious reasons it gets short shrift. Neither the books nor the movie is called ""Aunt Bea and Hobart"" after all though the movie at least might have been better if it was. In some ways ""Ramona"" plays like a girl version of ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" though it has a sweeter heart. There are nods to other films particularly ""A Christmas Story"" (youll know when). But mostly its just Ramona making a mess of things without the consequences of cleaning up afterward. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/ GoodyOnFilm.

Disney starlet Selena Gomez plays Beezus. Both sisters are nice and so are the actresses who play them They scrunch up their fresh faces to signify minor displeasure and they poke their plump lower lips out prettily to telegraph momentary snits. Dad (John Corbett) and Mom (Bridget Moynahan) as well as Moms slightly funky younger sister Aunt Bea (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Aunt Beas slightly funky former-and-future beau Hobart (Josh Duhamel) are nice too. And dont forget Ramonas wise third-grade teacher Mrs. Meacham (Sandra Oh) -- shes nice even when shes saying shush. Thats the thing about Ramona and Beezus Everyone is so darn gentle. Every escapade -- whether Ramona sets the house on fire or Dad loses his job -- ends in hugs. (The timely theme of economic downturn was also timely in 1975 when Cleary published Ramona and Her Father from which the subplot was taken.) The movie -- produced by Denise Di Novi and Alison Greenspan smart specialists in adaptations of young lit including The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants -- is shot in the bright colors of beach towels. On the one hand such equanimity reflects the cheery lighthearted humor of Clearys well-loved books first published half a century ago. On the other hand this proud graduate of the School of Cleary Classics wishes that like the young heroine herself Ramona and Beezus dared more often to color outside the lines.

Without much in the way of a governing narrative structure Elizabeth Allens innocuous film charts Ramona Quimby (Joey King)--her age advanced here from four to a more precocious nine years old--as she suffers a series of embarrassments in front of family friends and classmates. King captures Ramonas spunky oddball spirit but her imaginative antics often embellished with ill-fitting fantasy CGI frequently take a backseat to the inconsequential romantic predicaments of big sis Beezus (Gomez) and aunt Bea (Ginnifer Goodwin). Ramonas story admirably attempts to address issues of adult abandonment social alienation and economic instability the last of these via a timely subplot about Ramonas dad (John Corbett) being downsized thats wrapped up with disingenuous happily-ever-after tidiness. Yet even more than the overriding milquetoast atmosphere its this focus on real-world fears that destabilizes Allens film as the plethora of pressing adult concerns eventually becomes so pronounced that any trace of comedic verve dissipates thereby draining the proceedings of the very color that defines its idiosyncratic protagonist.

Ramona Quimby that irresistible and irrepressible problem child beloved by millions of readers since 1955 surprisingly has never starred in her own movie. This situation is remedied somewhat by ""Ramona and Beezus"" a sprightly generic kidpic that flattens and condenses elements from Beverly Clearys deservedly popular novels. Fronted by a well-cast Joey King as Ramona and a miscast but eminently marketable Selena Gomez as Beezus the Fox release should become a sought-after theatrical/homevid title among families with young daughters even though (or perhaps because) its not the personal distinctive portrait of misfit girlhood it could have been. Until now the sole attempt to bring Ramona to the screen was a short-lived 1988 Canadian TV skein starring a young Sarah Polley as the lovable pest. Watching ""Ramona and Beezus"" its hard not to feel a miniseries or even a film franchise would have better served the material; scribes Laurie Craig and Nick Pustay have essentially cherry-picked memorable episodes from Clearys eight Ramona books and shaped them as gracefully as possible (which is to say not very) into a single feature. Still there are nostalgic pleasures to be had in production designer Brent Thomas sunny re-creation of the neighborhood in Portland Ore. (actually Vancouver) where the books unfold -- a setting that Cleary whose Ramona novels were published over more than four decades always intended to be timeless and accessible to every generation of readers. Indeed few American families in contempo childrens literature have seemed more inviting more ordinary or more believable than the Quimbys of Klickitat Street -- a healthy generally happy clan consisting of loving parents Robert (John Corbett) and Dorothy (Bridget Moynahan) and their three daughters. With the youngest Roberta (twins Aila McCubbing and Zanti McCubbing) still in diapers the pic focuses primarily on overachieving teen Beatrice better known as Beezus and the hyperactive 9-year-old she sees as the bane of her existence Ramona. A wildly imaginative kid who can never keep her high spirits or her tongue in check Ramona is a heroine as exasperating as she is endearing and King -- whose pretty slightly impudent features can turn on a dime from grinning excitement to lip-quivering emotion -- makes her sympathetic even at her brattiest. Her teacher (Sandra Oh perfectly balancing authority and sarcasm) is quick to admonish Ramona when she gets stuck on the monkey bars or botches a show-and-tell assignment while her parents reactions range from affectionate indulgence to bemusement and irritation. Ramona feels the pressure to grow up more than ever when Mr. Quimby loses his job and becomes a stay-at-home dad while Mrs. Quimby goes back to work. Though this narrative throughline lends the film an unexpected timeliness the main reason the novels endure is Clearys gift for rendering Ramonas insecurities -- her feelings of never measuring up to Beezus of being constantly misunderstood despite the good intentions behind her every screw-up -- in the most specific yet universal of terms. ""Ramona and Beezus"" is nowhere near as resonant; its essentially a family sitcom (""Leave It to Ramona"") cramming a childhoods worth of formative moments -- throwing up at school losing a pet moving to a new house -- into 103 busy minutes slathered with pop tunes and predictable slapstick. The moment when Ramona angrily squeezes a tube of toothpaste into the sink -- one of Clearys funniest most acutely perceptive descriptions of childish acting-out -- is reduced here to a laugh-track throwaway. Helmer Elizabeth Allen (""Aquamarine"") rushes from one comic mishap to the next occasionally using eye-popping composites and cutouts to illustrate Ramonas fantasy life but deeper feelings and insights prove elusive. A couple of romantic subplots -- Beezus affection for longtime chum Henry Huggins (Hutch Dano) a renewed flirtation between Ramonas Aunt Bea (Ginnifer Goodwin) and old flame Hobart (Josh Duhamel) -- exist primarily as diversions for older members of the audience. Something similar seems to have motivated the casting of Gomez. Though shes good at projecting big-sisterly aggravation the Disney Channel pop star comes off as perhaps a shade too self-possessed even too attractive to entirely convince as the straight-laced image-conscious Beezus; its hard to shake the feeling Gomez was tapped primarily to boost the pics awareness among teens (and to make the obligatory soundtrack contribution ""Live Like Theres No Tomorrow""). Pics unnecessary title change from ""Beezus and Ramona"" the first novel in the series further smacks of market-conscious dumbing-down.

Its possible that resident Disney personality Gomez could bring in her tween and pre-tween audience but its more likely that ""Ramp;B"" will be a better fit for home viewing. It isnt the first time the Ramona books have been optioned for the screen. They served as the basis of a 10-episode 1988 Canadian TV series starring a 9-year-old Sarah Polley.That also happens to be Ramonas age in the script by Laurie Craig (""Ella Enchanted"") and Nick Pustay which finds her magical world turned upside down when her suddenly unemployed dad (John Corbett) eyes a new job that means moving away from her beloved Portland Ore. neighborhood.Determined to keep things as they are the accident-prone third-grader comes up with assorted moneymaking schemes that have a habit of not working out as planned often to the embarrassment of Beezus (aka Beatrice) and their Aunt Bea (Ginnifer Goodwin).Having directed the 2006 tween comic fantasy ""Aquamarine"" Elizabeth Allen would seem to have been a logical candidate for the job at hand but that pictures buoyant spark isnt so readily apparent here.Even sporadic CGI-injected flights of fancy intended to bring Ramonas vivid daydreams to life tend to fall self-consciously (not to mention budget-consciously) flat.Allen fares better with her cast establishing a credible sibling dynamic between newcomer King and Gomez while the appealing grown-ups -- also including Bridget Moynahan Josh Duhamel and Sandra Oh -- each effectively resists the temptation to go broad.Behind the scenes Vancouver subs for Ramonas bright stomping grounds with sunny assists from cinematographer John Bailey and production designer Brent Thomas though Mark Mothersbaughs forcefully chipper score could use an occasional time-out.
