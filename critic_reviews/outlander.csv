Conceived per the filmmakers as a ""sci-mythic"" version of ""Beowulf"" but playing more like a monster mash of B-grade offshoots of classier genre movies alien-vs.-Vikings actioner ""Outlander"" delivers occasionally but more often misses the mark. Not helped by a wooden perf from Jim Caviezel as a humanoid alien who accidentally imports a real alien to eighth-century Earth and then helps the baffled locals destroy it this is a fast-playoff item that may not make it past ancillary in some markets. Hardcore genre fans will turn out but word of mouth is likely to be pics biggest enemy. Project started a decade ago in the minds of co-writers Dirk Blackman and Howard McCain; latter was eventually attached as director and lensing was originally set for New Zealand. Following various financial snafus the production finally lensed in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland on a tab of around 31 million. But despite the scripts long gestation the finished product shows signs of hasty shooting and ideas that dont reach the screen fully formed. No fewer than 14 producers take credit. A spaceship crashes into a fjord in Norway 709 A.D. and only one astronaut human-looking Kainan (Caviezel) survives. Reprogramming his language lobe into Norse -- which then simply switches to English -- Kainan comes across a smoldering settlement before being captured by the inhabitants of the wooden-walled village of Herot where hes christened ""Outlander."" Bullish young warrior Wulfric (Jack Huston all flashing-eyed intensity) doesnt trust Kainan and when the wounded outlander is cared for by Freya (Kate Winslet lookalike Sophia Myles) the feisty daughter of Herots king Rothgar (John Hurt in full Viking hairpiece and whiskers) tension between the two alpha males only worsens. Only when a half-glimpsed monster attacks Herot and Kainan saves Rothgars life is the outlander grudgingly accepted. Wisely Rothgar accepts Kainans offer to exterminate the monster called a Moorwen but first Rothgar has to convince his own longtime enemy Gunnar (a rampaging Ron Perlman) that it wasnt the forces of Herot that trashed his village. Script tries to build up a full range of heroic characters in conflict but is let down by workaday dialogue and direction that doesnt conjure any special atmosphere. Only Hurt who can always be relied on to turn the most basic dialogue metal into something resembling gold comes close to giving the picture any verbal style. But despite a couple OK action sequences the first hour largely passes before delivering any serious mano a mano with the mean Moorwen. When this finally comes with nods to everything from ""Alien 3"" to ""The Descent"" pic does gain some momentum. But the confused structure with more flashbacks to Kainans backstory and an undeveloped guilt strand between Kainan and the Moorwen too often gets in the way. With no special development of the eras heroic codes the screenplay hardly makes a convincing case for being set in the Viking Age rather than any other period. Color processing has a cold grungy look in daytime exteriors and a slightly fuzzy amber-drenched look in interiors. Geoff Zanellis score is off-the-shelf heroic-action wallpaper. However production and costume design do sport an impressive authenticity and effects work does the job in a genre-ish way. Alas Patrick Tatopoulos monster simply recalls elements of other more famous aliens. OutlanderU.S.-Germany ProductionA Weinstein Co. (in U.S.)/Telepool (in Germany) release of a Weinstein Co.

Okay I need ideas people. Cowboys vs zombies? Too obvious. Pirates vs vampires? Too expensive. Wait I got it Vikings vs aliens Yes its Beowulf with tentacles as jobbing space-cop Kainan (Jim Caviezel) crash-lands in twelfth-century Scandinavia and accidentally unleashes one seriously cranky spectacularly toothy space beast. When the animal goes on the inevitable rampage in the mead hall of King Rothgar (John Hurt) Kainans the only one with the knowledge and skills to end the monsters reign of terror.Director Howard McCain has assembled a remarkable cast for what is essentially a deeply silly slice of B-movie hokum erstwhile godhead Caviezel seems a little lost but Hurt and Ron Perlman - both of whom have had some experience with intergalactic carnivores in the past - look like theyre having a whale of a time. No dark-age cliche is left unexploited from swords sandals and excessive drinking to buxom wenches and strapping warriors with names like Freya and Wulfric (and even with no detectable irony Boromir).Its all wildly predictable laughable stuff. But McCain directs with terrific energy making the most of his mud-spattered nordic locations and competent CGI and managing to keep an overstretched narrative compelling. He also never allows the film to descend into obvious self-parody theres a broad seam of playful mockery running throughout but never to the point that it undermines the narrative. Daft obvious but hugely enjoyable Outlander is superior trash.

I remember wanting to see it when it came out at the flix but never got around to it. In hindsight though I enjoyed it on my telly the incredibly original monster wouldve been extremely cool on the big screen. Its release so close to Beowulf was unfortunate but it has been unfairly compared to it here. Forget Beowulf. Forget any historical accuracy snobbery you might harbour. If you like a scifi monster flick with a temporal twist youd enjoy this film.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 15 2009SteveFeaturedIn my opinion the beast alien was brilliant very original - would be good to see a franchise of this monster perhaps. BUT the Vikings were laughable. Far too LOTR and severely lacking in authenticity which I thought was the Achilles Heel to an otherwise average movie. Concept was good enough for the film to be great if only enough time and nuture had been spent on it. Jon Hurt is a legend but not suited to the role. Ron Pearlman was the only decent viking representative and his role was unfortunately short lived...FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 29 2009PaulFeaturedI took my two 12 year old sons to see Beowulf and I liked it. I liked this film better but was a bit disappointed when I realised it was the same story but with a slight twist. I am still glad I watched it though and didnt find it boring. This isnt a film for the youngsters although my sons would disagree aEUR"" Aliens Vikings scenes with beheadings blood guts and battling monsters aEUR"" what more could young teenage boys want?

Starring Jim Caviezel John Hurt Jack Huston and Sophia Myles. Directed by Howard McCain. (R. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Humanity has not yet devised more dispiriting words to flash at the start of a movie than these found in the opening seconds of ""Outlander"" ""Norway year 709."" ""Norway year 709"" - you know as opposed to ""Norway year 708"" which was way before things got interesting and ""Norway year 710"" which was right after all the fun. ""Norway year 709."" Three words and you know youre in for it animal skins; hearty manly laughter; and enough mead to drown a horse. Plus dark meeting halls guys eating meat off the bone and everybody breathing into each others faces. Ah yes the glory days before dental floss. Yet ""Outlander"" in its early minutes does hold out one faint promise of relief. It presents us with a protagonist with a modern consciousness a man who wants to be there no more than we do. Kainan (Jim Caviezel) soon to be known as Outlander crashes his spaceship on Earth and instead of landing in Athens year 400 B.C. or Florence year 1500 or New York year 1925 he ends up in ... well you know where. He lands at a time and place thats guaranteed to leave him not particularly impressed by the extent of human achievement. These were the days of small provincial kingdoms battling it out against other small provincial kingdoms over who gets to have the best meeting hall and the best hunk of roasted bear. John Hurt plays King Rothgar (not to be confused with Philip Rothgar the Norse novelist) who is getting older but is nonetheless leery of leaving his kingdom to his hotheaded young assistant Wulfric (Jack Huston). In the meantime the kingdom is in crisis Rothgar and Wulfric are under the impression that King Gunnar and his troops have been attacking and killing his men in guerrilla-type raids. And its just not true. In fact a dragon-like creature has been decimating both Gunnar and Rothgars forces and the only one who knows whats going on is ... the Outlander. The Outlander has it all figured out but he can tell his new Viking friends only as much as they can handle. To be specific he leaves out the whole thing about coming from outer space. Norse mythology and fantasy often go hand in hand and so the idea of setting an actual sci-fi fantasy in the Viking era was hardly ridiculous. In fact ""Outlander"" holds interest for about an hour and features one admirable sequence in which the Outlander explains his previous encounters with dragon-like creatures to the kings daughter (the feisty Sophia Myles). As he describes it in terms she can understand we see what hes actually referring to a violent history of interplanetary warfare and mass extermination. The contrast between the words and pictures is for the moment fascinating. But in its second half ""Outlander"" falls apart completely becoming nothing but a violent mindless monster movie along the lines of ""Alien vs. Predator."" The adventure story is lost and all thats left is the wet nose and snapping teeth of the dragon. The film is in no way frightening just intermittently (and unintentionally) funny. Until that unfortunate second half the actors behave as though theyre appearing in some heroic fable which makes one wonder if the final cut of the film with its emphasis on nonstop monster action took the actors by surprise. Later it certainly must have surprised the cast to find the movie opening in Latvia in July and then Kuwait Lithuania and Turkey before making it to the United States. ""Outlander"" has the whiff of something being dumped getting a perfunctory release on its way to DVD heaven. -- Advisory This film contains violence.

"Outlander stars Jim Caviezel Ron Perlman Sophia Myles - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Outlander stars Jim Caviezel Ron Perlman Sophia Myles Michael PhillipsTribune critic Consider the phrase Norway 709 A.D. Theres nothing funny about it. And yet if it appears on screen immediately following a shot of a spaceship hurtling toward Earth youve got a film with at least one laugh more than "" Bride Wars.""In ""Outlander"" the nuttiest hunk of junk in many months Viking warriors and a stoic intergalactic traveler join forces to combat an enormous beetle with whiplash stingers. The bug resembles an AMC Pacer after being tricked out by ""Alien"" designer H.R. Giger. The movie recalls ""10000 B.C."" in its historical veracity and straight-faced devotion to your camp enjoyment. Full disclosure I have yet to live down my guilt-free enjoyment of ""10000 B.C."" People still come up and say ""Yeah that 10000 B.C. ... You owe me nine bucks for that one. Seriously. Nine bucks."" One persons camp is anothers pain.Most of the juicy bits in ""Outlander"" arrive in the first half not long after the splashdown of spaceman Kainan. Hes played by Jim Caviezel recently seen as Jesus in ""The Passion of the Christ."" Surveying this strange new landscape Kainan whips out his travel case sets up a piece of equipment and whooosh Into his brain the gizmo downloads centuries of Earth knowledge and fun facts in a painful rush. Talk about cramming Nobody in Viking World believes Kainans stories about the slimy stowaway known as a Moorwen until several gory Viking deaths pass and even the skeptical King Rothgar played by John Hurt concedes theyve got a problem.The script by Dirk Blackman and director Howard McCain has issues of its own. My favorite line comes when Rothgar says to his eligible but headstrong daughter ""Youre not getting any younger Freya."" The king a born matchmaker wants Freya (Sophia Myles) to marry Wulfric (Jack Huston) because well that name for starters. But in the presence of Kainan whom the Vikings think came from across the sea or some such shes confused. ""All the women are talking about you"" she says coyly sounding like an 8th Century Norske sorority girl.Shot mostly in Newfoundland ""Outlander"" grows less risible and more familiar as it approaches its lengthy underground-cavern climax pitting Viking and alien against aliens unwanted pet. One things certain about director and co-writer McCain though. He knows how a Mixmaster works and hes not afraid to wield it.mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating R (for violence).Running time 145.Opening Jan. 23.Starring Jim Caviezel (Kainan); Sophia Myles (Freya); Jack Huston (Wulfric); Ron Perlman (Gunnar); John Hurt (Rothgar).Directed by Howard McCain; written by Dirk Blackman and McCain; photographed by Pierre Gill; visual effects supervised by David Kuklish; edited by David Dodson; music by Geoff Zanelli; production designed by David Hackl; produced by John Schimmel and Chris Roberts.

"Spaceman Norsemen meet in sci-fi romp ""Outlander"" - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies MOVIE REVIEW Spaceman Norsemen meet in sci-fi romp James Caviezel is a visitor from outer space in Outlander. (The weinstein company) By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / January 23 2009 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + Handsome James Caviezel crash-lands from space to Vikings-era Norway in ""Outlander"" and proceeds to help a tribe of heavily bearded crypto-medievals rid their community of the ""Aliens""-caliber creature the spaceman brought with him.Whats that? Handsome man? Medievals? Science fiction set in the distant past? I know I know. But its ""Out-lander."" ""Highlander"" is something else. (Basically.) Both are high-concept effects adventures but Christopher Lambert didnt spend five ""Highlander"" movies in a wetsuit the way Caviezel does here. In many scenes he looks like hes on his way to a spinning class on the Starship Enterprise. ""Hi Im Captain James T. Kirk. Ill be your instructor this morning.""Caviezel playing a man named Kainin acts with that kind of push too. He really is leading a workout - the grunting the beads of sweat the shouts of encouragement. He shows the Norsepeople (feisty Sophia Myles chest-beating Jack Huston John Hurt as king and all-too-briefly Ron Perlman as a rival tribesman) how to obliterate this people-eating creature called the Moorwen. (Its from outer space but has a name straight out of ""Beowulf."") Nothing seems to work. And the movie builds a fair degree of intrigue over how this massive impressively designed special effect can be stopped. But as handsome as ""Outlander"" is to look at its never exciting or interesting enough to justify waiting 100 minutes for an answer.Anyway the real question is will the Norsefolk learn to worship Kainin? Caviezel who hasnt been in a whole lot since ""The Passion of the Christ"" gets to play another savior.Director Howard McCain does nothing wrong per se. The showdowns and stunt work are watchable. But proficiency is beside the point in a venture like this. You need a spark of madness or glee. Something unforeseen or shameless but a little embarrassing - like Sean Connery in two ""Highlanders."" Once or twice the camera splatters with blood but wheres the joy? By taking nonsense seriously ""Outlander"" never achieves camp. Its a comic book thats mistaken itself for scripture.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Share Tweet Everything about Outlander suggests an enjoyably awful cheese-fest of Uwe Boll proportions Its a retelling of Beowulf in which a good alien helps some Vikings fight a bad alien in a de-saturated grungy setting that recalls such modern unabashed crapfests as Pathfinder The Chronicles Of Riddick and the Alien Vs. Predator movies. Surprise number one Its smarter than it looks. Surprise number two That doesnt entirely ruin it as an action film. It starts in 709 AD as a spaceship crash-lands in a Norwegian lake on the ""abandoned seed colony"" of Earth. Out crawls armored space-soldier James Caviezel who quickly runs across some angry Vikings ruled by king John Hurt. The people of Hurts walled town Heorot--including cranky heir apparent Jack Huston and reluctant love interest Sophia Myles--think Caviezel must belong to the raiding party that just destroyed a nearby village. Its an uphill battle to convince them that the killer is actually a tentacled glowing nasty that was aboard Caviezels downed ship. Its harder still to fight the thing with primitive Viking weapons. Outlanders plot follows Beowulf in its broad particulars so little about it is surprising until the second half which gets ambitious with Caviezels backstory takes the action off Earth for a while and upgrades the film from cheap Xena look-alike to pricey Riddick look-alike. First-time screenwriters Dirk Blackman and Howard McCain (McCain also directed Blackman also produced and both collaborated on writing Underworld Rise Of The Lycans) packs in the plot; that tends to slow down the action a good deal but it also gives their film a welcome multi-dimensionality. In particular the side story involving Ron Perlman as a neighboring Viking leader with ties to and grudges against Hurts enclave offers a chance at the kind of character development found in few films featuring grunting protagonists in fur loincloths. And as usual Hurts commitment and gravity greatly elevates his material--he plays King Kickass Viking-Dude as if he were King Lear. Ultimately Outlander is an odd mishmash of genres with too much message and musing to be propulsive and too much cornball monster movie to take seriously. But while the blend may not satisfy fans of pure action or pure drama at least it gives them both a slightly new flavor to try.

They couldve used the line in Outlander too. Maybe they did and I just missed it - in one of those mead-hall scenes perhaps where wenches serve Vikings their grog just before a giant monster from outer space goes on the attack. Thats when the hardy Norsemen shout ""Bring me my blade woman"" and trot off to get sliced and diced by this mysterious ""dragon"" thats descended like a curse. An enjoyably goofy hybrid of extraterrestrial sci-fi and Iron Age action Outlander boasts a super-serious Jim Caviezel in the title role. The Passion of the Christ star is a stranger whos crash-landed his UFO in the realm of King Rothgar (John Hurt) having unwittingly taken a humongous carnivorous predator - a Moorwen - along for the ride. Passing himself off as a visitor from ""the North"" the Outlander - Kainan - is greeted with mistrust. But slowly the Vikes take a liking to the taciturn fella in the sleeveless suit made of funny fabric especially Freya (Sophia Myles) the sword-wielding daughter of the king. Myles who has a bit of a Kate Winslet air about her and was very good in last springs Scottish indie Mister Foe walks around in animal skins and gets off ridiculously campy dialogue without losing her grip. Its an acting feat The special effects are passable Ron Perlman is virtually unrecognizable as a rival Viking and Newfoundland and Nova Scotia double for Norway without much trouble - thanks to some Lord of the Rings-style computer graphics work.

"Movie review Outlander -- 2 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Outlander -- 2 out of 5 stars Jim Caviezel Jim Caviezel Jim Caviezel Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Who knew that when James Caviezel became the most popular big-screen Jesus of all time hed have to endure 40 years in the cinematic wilderness afterward? B-movies indie films that no one sees its as if JC is atoning for some Mel Gibson sin or other.The latest from the always stoic Caviezel is Outlander one of the more outlandish B-pictures to come out of the Great Movie Mash-up Machine known as The Weinstein Co. Its a Beowulf knock-off about a spaceman who crash lands among Norsemen and helps them fight a dragon. Think of it as Vikings vs. Predators. In an entertaining first half hour this man from a world far away plummets into a lake in 8th-century Norway. He sets off his distress beacon buries a dead comrade whips out his laser pistol and takes a look around. He stumbles across a burning empty village and next thing you know hes lost his cool gun has to endure torture and cant seem to get the bloody Vikings to understand that no he didnt empty that village -- no human did.Did I mention his distress buoy has this neato-but-painful language-embedding gizmo? Spaceman speaks Norwegian he does. Because the computer describes Earth as a ""seed colony abandoned"" -- the aliens know all about the place. The Vikings will need to work together to kill this beast which the ""Outlander"" who goes by the name ""Kainan"" (Canaan?) knows all too well. The monster is of alien origin and appears to know the story of Beowulf and Grendel and Grendels mom too.But first King Rothgar (John Hurt surprisingly at home in leather) and King Gunnar (Ron Perlman born to be in B-movies) have to feud; the great warrior and king-in-waiting Wulfric (Jack Huston) has to compete in a game of ""shields"" with the Outlander; and the fetching princess Freya (Sophia Miles of one of those Underworld movies) must be smitten by the non-Viking now in their midst.All perfectly silly but treated professionally by all involved. The action is first-rate. The characters are stock types -- the hard-drinking blacksmith who befriends Kainan the princess as good with a sword as the men the giant (Perlman) who wields a battle-axe because swords are for sissies. Of course theres also a tow-headed lad named ""Eric"" who will someday have a son named ""Leif"" and discover America. But thats for the sequel.Co-writer director Howard McCain (he wrote the latest Underworld which also opens today) does OK by the battles and lends the dialogue just enough Norse saga-speak to make it credible. ""If you truly believe you write the tale of your own life then the end is up to you.""Palatable to any kid raised on comics sci-fi and sword and sorcery. But is it enough to bring Jim Caviezel back from the wilderness? Naaaah.
