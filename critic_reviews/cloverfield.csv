Shes made a decision to leave though whom or what isnt exactly clear until she ditches her keys and engagement ring on the way out the door of her New Orleans apartment. As she drives her car into the Louisiana night her phone rings flashing the name ""Ben."" ""Michelle please come back"" he implores. ""Running away isnt going to help anything."" She hangs up. As the car radio warns statically of a ""power surge"" Ben calls again. Tearful distracted Michelle loses control of the vehicle smashing through a guardrail and into blackness. Related Story Star Wars The Force Awakens Is a Mashup Masterpiece When Michelle awakens shes on a thin mattress on the floor of a cinder-block room. Her injured leg is in a brace that is chained to the wall; her belongings are just out of reach. A steel door clangs open heavily and a man comes in bearing a tray of scrambled eggs. ""What are you going to do to me?"" she asks. His ominous response ""Im going to keep you alive.""The man explains that they are in an survivalist bunker beneath his farmhouse. Theres been an attack above ""a big one."" Maybe chemical maybe nuclear. It could be the Ruskies or it could be Martians. Regardless ""Everyone outside of here is dead."" He estimates that theyll have to remain in the bunker for a year or possibly two. Almost as an afterthought he adds ""My name is Howard by the way.""Thus opens 10 Cloverfield Lane a wicked witty thriller by the first-time director Dan Trachtenberg. Is Howard a psychopath holding Michelle captive toward his own degenerate ends? Or has he truly saved her from a global Armageddon? Or maybe ... both? The film dances nimbly between explanations maintaining its balance even as it delights in knocking viewers off theirs.Mary Elizabeth Winstead (The Thing Smashed) is excellent as Michelle self-sufficient without being superhuman her eyes alert to any opportunity to escape. And as Howard John Goodman gives one of his best performances in years offering up a helping of the quasi-genial menace he deployed to such great effect in Barton Fink. Rounding out the tiny principal cast is John Gallagher Jr. (who was great in Short Term 12) as Emmett a handyman who helped construct Howards bunker and now shares it with him and Michelle. (Bradley Cooper has a sub-cameo as the phone voice of Ben.)10 Cloverfield Lane alternates moods seamlessly ratcheting tension to the breaking point and then deflating it with black humor. One moment the film raises uneasy questions about who exactly is the ""Megan"" to whom Howard keeps referring and what became of her. The next it segues into its cheery soundtrack of oldies courtesy of the jukebox Howard has installed in the bunker ""Hey Venus"" ""Tell Him"" and most cunningly a day-to-day montage of life underground set to ""I Think Were Alone Now."" This is a film savvy enough to recognize that there is nothing more intrinsically nerve-fraying--not abduction not apocalypse--than a car alarm.  And while it is not openly satirical in the vein of the terrific Cabin in the Woods it shares that movies sharp knowing sensibility. (Little wonder that the Cabin director Drew Goddard is one of the producers.)The original script for the film by Josh Campbell and Matt Stuecken was titled The Cellar. When J.J. Abramss Bad Robot Productions began developing the picture in 2012 it brought in Damien Chazelle (Whiplash) for rewrites and in the process noticed tonal similarities to the 2008 monster movie Cloverfield which Abrams had produced. The new films name was altered accordingly with Abrams explaining that while it is not a sequel to Cloverfield--nor even taking place in the same fictional universe--it is a ""blood relative"" and ""spiritual successor."" Its also a considerably better movie and I say that as someone who enjoyed Cloverfield.So has the Earth been invaded? Is it all a monstrous hoax? I surely wont tell. (Though be advised Others--including the films own promotional materials--have not been so circumspect and this is a movie best enjoyed with a minimum of foreknowledge.) I will merely recommend 10 Cloverfield Lane as a clever canny thriller and endorse an insight that Howard offers in a moment of uncharacteristic self-knowledge ""People are strange creatures.""

Twitter previousAmericanitis The Disease of Living Too FastnextQuit Your Job Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day. Continue Reading carianoff/flickr Why Some People Respond to Stress by Falling Asleep Elijah Wolfson Fight or flight or sleep Last month my wife and I found ourselves in a disagreement about whether or not our apartment was clean enough for guests--the type of medium-sized disagreement that likely plagues all close relationships. In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

As Hurricane Katrina raged through New Orleans in 2005 neighborhood after neighborhood collapsed from flooding. Of the houses that stood many still had to be bulldozed due to mold within the walls. But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion. Continue Reading Charles Mostoller / Reuters Can Personality Be Changed? Scott Barry Kaufman Psychologists have long debated how flexible someones ""true"" self is. Almost everyone has something they want to change about their personality. In 2014 a study that traced peoples goals for personality change found that the vast majority of its subjects wanted to be more extraverted agreeable emotionally stable and open to new experiences. A whopping 97 percent said they wished they were more conscientious. These desires appeared to be rooted in dissatisfaction. People wanted to become more extraverted if they werent happy with their sex lives hobbies or friendships. They wanted to become more conscientious if they were displeased with their finances or schoolwork. The findings reflect the social psychologist Roy Baumeisters notion of ""crystallization of discontent"" Once people begin to recognize larger patterns of shortcomings in their lives he contends they may reshuffle their core values and priorities to justify improving things.

Abrams production which begins as one sort of movie before turning into another sort of movie but manages to be continuously bad. A woman fleeing a troubled relationship (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) spins out in her car flies off the road and awakes in a sealed bunker presided over by a retired military man (John Goodman at his most sinister). He insists that hes rescued her from what could only have been a nuclear or chemical terror attack outside which introduces a welcome ambiguity into the dull PG-13 Saw sequel that follows. A plot twist reveals that this is actually a sequel to a different film; thats what constitutes a surprise in Hollywood entertainment these days.

Abramss Mystery Box Tying a potentially enjoyable thriller to the Cloverfield universe was probably a mistake Amy Nicholson 03/11/2016 TheAmyNicholson Note This review may contain spoilers about the nature of the movie. Proceed with caution if you want everything to remain a secret. J.J. Abrams is the Sorcerers Apprentice of marketing. He seizes campaigns like a magic wand bewitching his films with secrecy and hype. His powers worked for 2008s mysteriously named Cloverfield which even generated fan theories about its inscrutable title (the true story of the name is not that exciting). He hid the monster in Super 8 to make people buy tickets to see if it was cool. (It wasnt.) Most brilliantly Star Wars The Force Awakens trickled out trailers without revealing a drop of the plot. In fact the commercials turned out to be more creative than the script. Yet the audience -- his marching broomsticks -- sometimes turns against its master especially when his spells are sloppy. Take Star Trek Into Darkness for which Abrams quarantined the first-act reveal that Benedict Cumberbatch was playing fan favorite Khan. A Khan showdown would sell tickets. Instead Abramss pointless charade probably cost the film millions. 10 Cloverfield Lane [Note Its produced by Paramount which is a corporate sibling of MTV News.] is a decent thriller that would have been delightful if J.J. Abrams had never touched it at all. Before its Abrams-ification it was a low-budget spec script called The Cellar penned by writers Josh Campbell and Matthew Stuecken. The Cellar is about a woman Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who wakes up in a bunker ruled by a conspiracy nut named Howard (John Goodman). Howard claims hes saved her life and his half-wit farmhand Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) agrees. The outdoor air is contaminated -- perhaps even poisoned by Martians. She has to gamble live with a maybe-madman or escape and risk death. Her dilemma becomes ours. Do we cheer when Michelle conks Howard on the head and grabs for his keys? Or do we scream ""Stop you moron -- stay inside"" Thats a hell of a hook. Ambitious young filmmakers could have shot it on the cheap in one room. But cheap movies come out every day -- nearly 20 low-budget films get released each week -- and no one might have ever seen it. And so The Cellar sold to J.J. Abrams who sprung for a great cast a couple of CGI monsters and an advertising budget so big it couldnt be ignored. He tapped commercials director Dan Trachtenberg to direct and Damien Chazelle (Whiplash) to polish the script. Everyone involved took a vow of silence until Abrams announced the films existence two months ago spinning it into a surprise event. Compare that to The Force Awakenss 38 months of scrutiny. Paramount PicturesIt would have worked too without Abramss marketing mistake. In January he announced that the movie would be called 10 Cloverfield Lane -- a direct nod to his 170 million space monster blockbuster; a ""spiritual successor."" Great publicity dumb move. The title alone is a spoiler. Weve seen whats out there watched it smash Manhattan and burst Lizzy Caplans stomach. Forget wondering if Howard is insane. Now we suspect the madman is probably right before the movie even starts. Without the shivery thrill of suspense we also spend the whole movie trapped in an airless box. The only jolts come from noisy jump-scares. While Michelle schemes to figure out what we already know our attention drifts. We notice the spot-on set design with its cheap silk sunflowers Bible Pictionary and cartoon duck shower curtain -- suspiciously feminine touches that are important to file away. Well savor the Costco pantry stocked with Fruit by the Foot and stump-size tins of crackers. And we notice the scripts slipshod mistakes -- like why would a 300-pound survivalist put his crucial filtration system in a room only accessible by a skinny air shaft? 10 Cloverfield Lane has its pleasures. Emmett is a charming moron. Winsteads Michelle is quick and smart a MacGyver in chipped nail polish which the film fixates on to show the passage of time. In her first scene she dumps her fiance by fleeing their apartment. She leaves her engagement ring and takes the scotch; this heartbreaker has her own priorities. Goodman is introduced belly-first his girth blocking the door to Michelles cell. Before we see his face we see his gun. Point made Shes not getting past this guy without a fight. Winstead and Goodman are great actors but Trachtenberg uses them all wrong. 10 Cloverfield Lane could have salvaged its spoiled reveal by shifting our loyalties between them from scene to scene and letting us see Michelle through Howards eyes as an ungrateful brat who could get them all killed. Yet Goodman is never allowed empathy even though he deserves it. The man might be a new David Koresh but he is sharing his food with two strangers. All he asks is that they lend a hand with cooking pee according to his plumbing schedule and help him solve a puzzle or two. When he claims ""I know I sound like a sensible guy"" were meant to snigger. But cmon his doomsday bunker is immaculate. Theres a glimmer of hurt pride in Goodmans eyes -- dont these millennials appreciate his eco-toilet? -- but even in those moments the film plays him like a tyrant. Think Kim Jong-un crying to James Franco about his daddy. Eventually 10 Cloverfield Lane presents a dilemma we cant immediately answer. Whats better the villain you know or the danger you dont? It rushes the answer before we get a chance to decide. Yet in a way thats the question Abrams has been asking himself his entire career. He has always bet on the mystery monster. For 10 Cloverfield Lane he placed his chips on a known invader. Both ways he has gambled and lost. Time to scrap his belabored marketing tricks and take Howards advice ""Just hang loose.""

It has the appeal of suspense radio plays from the a30s and a40s 175 Shares Share 131 Tweet 40 Share 4 Share Email Print Share Photo Paramount Pictures The trim psychodrama 10 Cloverfield Lane efficiently poses the following question Is the sweaty prepper who has imprisoned a Louisiana woman in an elaborate underground bunker on the grounds that there has been a nuclear or chemical attack from either Russians or extraterrestrials a) A psychopath b) A savior c) Both? Itas not an easy call for Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who was in the process of fleeing her abusive boyfriend when she was blindsided by another vehicle waking to find herself hooked to an IV (good) and chained to a wall (bad). She can take the word of Harold (John Goodman) a a massive militaristic survivalist with the worldas worst bedside manner a that the air up there is poisoned and humanity wiped out. Or she can incapacitate him grab his keys and either save herself or stumble into a death trap. There are clarifying/complicating factors. Early on a radio newscaster mentions a mysterious blackout on the Eastern Seaboard a red herring? The third inhabitant of the bunker a bearded young handyman named Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) seems to agree with Howard that theres a reason to remain underground -- but hes a vague character either not too swift or not too truthful. Finally Howard spends much time reminiscing about an absent maybe dead daughter Is Michelle meant as her replacement? And whats with that title? The film carries the imprimatur of the J.J. Abrams-Bad Robot factory that gave us the clever subjective-camera giant-monster flick Cloverfield. Was that monster -- which destroyed much of Manhattan -- the source of the aforementioned blackout? Could it have friends in Louisiana? Its a shame that director Dan Trachtenberg and screenwriters Josh Campbell Matthew Stuecken and Damien Chazelle (of Whiplash) have so little room to maneuver. Too much information kills the mystery but too little makes you feel as if the filmmakers are spinning their wheels to fill out the (brief) running time. And neither Emmett nor Howard is an especially fascinating character. Gallagher gives you no odd behaviors to parse while Goodman makes Howard unrelievedly nuts -- hes stuck in one key. Winstead is pretty and clear-eyed and doesnt hit a false note but as she proved in the druggie drama Smashed she has outgrown dullish horror-movie ingenues. Shes looks as trapped as her character. For all that 10 Cloverfield Lane does what it needs to do make you sit and squirm and want very badly to know. It has the appeal of suspense radio plays from the 30s and 40s and even a touch of Orson Welless most infamous Mercury Theater broadcast. And if Howard doesnt have enough dramatic stature the questions the character raises give you chills. Is he a delusional psychopath or a grandiose paranoiac; Ted Bundy or Ammon Bundy? Could he be a liberals nightmare -- a guy who thinks Trump tells it like it is -- and right?

In the spiritual successor to Cloverfield its the people whove been preparing for it to happen that youve really got to watch out for. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > John Goodman and Mary Elizabeth Winstead in 10 Cloverfield Lane. Michele K. Short / Paramount Pictures ID 8184258 Cloverfield was a found footage film about a gargantuan spindly limbed monster ravaging New York. The 2008 film was also sidelong a movie about 9/11 -- not the causes or the consequences but the visceral awfulness of being in the middle of an assault on the city frantically trying to discern whats happening where to run and whether your loved ones are safe. Its shaky-cam style evoked the videos shot on the fly by eyewitnesses that have become our usual first look at disasters in the years since 2001. Its characters were just ordinary people who didnt defeat the creature or figure out its origins or make smart decisions in their attempts to stay alive. Cloverfield dealt in a recent American trauma the way its kaiju classic predecessor Godzilla evoked Japans fears about nuclear weapons in the wake of World War II. View this image > John Gallagher Jr. and Winstead in 10 Cloverfield Lane. Michele K. Short / Paramount Pictures ID 8184268 The monster in 10 Cloverfield Lane -- a clever modest thriller being positioned (a little cynically) as a sort of follow-up to that first film -- offers a different kind of real-world resonance. The monsters name is Howard and hes played with ominous conviction by John Goodman.Howard is the man responsible for building the well-stocked bunker -- a sterile florescent-lit space filled with humbly homey trappings -- in which most of the movie takes place. Hes a former Navy guy and a current doomsday prepper who claims theres been some kind of major attack and that everyone outside is dead. He insists that hes saved the lives of the two people hes taken in and that itll be at least a year or two until the fallout settles and its safe to leave.The big questions in 10 Cloverfield Lane are whether Howard is delusional or lying (not the same thing) in order to Kimmy Schmidt his two younger guests and whether there really is trouble outside. Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) has plenty of reasons to doubt his trustworthiness. Shes in the process of fleeing an unhappy relationship when shes sideswiped by a car on a quiet Louisiana road; when she wakes up she finds herself chained to a wall in an unfurnished room in his shelter informed by her apparent abductor Howard that the world has ended and that shes only alive thanks to him. Howard whos held on to artifacts of his departed daughter like hes eager for a replacement frees Michelle from her chains but not the bunker. Shes down the hall from Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) the only other resident whos curiously unbothered by his living situation -- because as we soon learn he not only chose but fought to come inside for reasons that suggest Howard was right about at least a few things. View this image > Goodman in 10 Cloverfield Lane. Michele K. Short / Paramount Pictures ID 8184273 10 Cloverfield Lane -- which was helmed by Dan Trachtenberg and (like Cloverfield) produced by J.J. Abrams -- is a nimbly directed three-person show that often comes across like a very dysfunctional family drama the characters falling or forcefully placed into the roles of father daughter and boy next door. However its the relationship between Michelle and Howard in which the armrest-clutching tension builds falls and builds again. Winstead is a remarkably present actor and Michelle is established as a gratifyingly level-headed and aware character from the start For example in a pre-bunker moment she cautiously eyes an approaching car while fueling up at a gas station -- just like you know a real woman traveling alone at night would. The result is the rare thriller protagonist whose every decision feels reasonable even though the situation shes navigating is a mire of questionable truths and conflicting evidence (what are those rumblings overhead?) which leaves her constantly uncertain about what to believe.And what to believe about Howard? As good a heroine as Winsteads Michelle is its really Goodmans character who sears through the movie a combination conspiracy theorist and ironhanded host. 10 Cloverfield Lane positions Howard as an extremist whos quietly thrilled that the moment hes been preparing for has arrived and that he has a captive audience to tell ""I told you so."" Hes introduced through a rumbling down the hallway like a giant -- fee-fi-fo-fum -- while the camera focuses on his stomping feet first then the gun on his hip and then ultimately settles on his glowering face as Goodman plays up the slouching ballast of his body. Hes the man whos been muttering about invasions all of his life finally sure that hes been proven right a petty tyrant tending his windowless domain with a self-satisfied air ordering Emmett and Michelle down to dinner and dictating appropriate conversation for the table. View this image > Goodman Winstead Gallagher in 10 Cloverfield Lane. Michele K. Short / Paramount Pictures ID 8184285 Like the resentful outcast Kylo Ren in The Force Awakens or super-powered mens rights activist Kilgrave from Jessica Jones Howard comes across as a warped mutated version of someone who crawled off a Twitter block list. Hes a paranoid dont-tread-on-me nightmare the concentrated embodiment of the sentiment that ""they"" are coming for us (and in Howards case ""they"" could be anything from the Russians to the Martians) and that everyone who hasnt been stockpiling goods and weapons deserves what they get. ""You people"" he sneers at Michelle when he senses that she thinks hes crazy. ""Crazy is when you build your ark after the floods have already come."" Howard hasnt just been preparing for Armageddon but longing for it to come along and prove him both right and necessary the unquestioned king of the underground lair hes built for himself. He reminds Emmett and Michelle repeatedly that they owe him gratitude and when Michelle does thank him he cant help but break into a self-satisfied smile -- one of Goodmans more chilling choices.Long before 10 Cloverfield Lane gets to the issue of whether or not there are monsters above ground its evident that Howard is monster enough below it a figure of frustrated resentful masculinity (he alleges offhand that his ex-wife turned his daughter against him) finally crowned with the authority he feels has long been denied him. While the original Cloverfield deliberately positioned its cast of twentysomethings to be dwarfed by a largescale disaster 10 Cloverfield Lane is rewardingly claustrophobic keeping its focus tight on the characters and their cramped space while whatever disasters there are loom outside the bunker. Inside of it is someone who is sure hes just been handed the ultimate proof that he knows whats best for everyone -- and he has a gun. Given that reality who wouldnt start to think about making a run for it even if there may be nowhere safe left to go?

Photo (Michele K. Short/Paramount Pictures MOVIE REVIEW 10 Cloverfield Lane Running time 105 minutes. Rated PG-13 (violence disturbing images). ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is a real nail-biter of a monster movie. The question is Whos the monster? When Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"") wakes up in a windowless basement after a car wreck she assumes its her caretaker/captor (John Goodman) a wild-eyed schlub named Howard who has both bandaged her wounds and chained her to the wall. But he tells a different story. ""Theres been an attack. Luckily Ive prepared for this"" he says. The air outside is contaminated; theyll need to stay underground in his well-stocked bunker for at least a year. This ostensible sequel to J.J. Abrams ""Cloverfield"" (2008) is the stylistic opposite of its precursor Where that film was a frenetic found-footage thriller this ones a claustrophobic three-person drama directed by Dan Trachtenberg in an impressive feature debut. He ratchets up the tension at about two minutes in and doesnt let up until the credits roll. John Gallagher Jr. (""The Newsroom"") rounds out the trio as Emmett a local hick with a broken arm who claims he begged for admission to the shelter when the mysterious attack -- aliens? Russians? -- began. (Bradley Cooper also puts in a voice cameo as Michelles boyfriend.) As the resourceful Michelle tries to figure out whats really going on Trachtenberg gets to work on your nerves with the help of an unrelentingly taut score from Bear McCreary and an occasional pop hit on Howards old-timey jukebox -- ""I Think Were Alone Now"" has never seemed so malevolent. This setup isnt exactly novel (plus Winstead bears a striking resemblance to Brie Larson of the hostage drama ""Room"") but the screenplay is so nicely sparse its twists so well deployed that you dont feel anythings being reheated. And speaking of twists The less you know the better. (In fact dont even go on to the next paragraph if youre a real spoiler purist.) All three actors hand in first-rate performances but this is Goodmans film placing him in the homebody-psychopath hall of fame alongside Annie Wilkes and Norman Bates. One minute hes exhorting his guests to use coasters under their drinking glasses; the next hes uncapping a barrel of flesh-eating acid. But youre so consistently unsure of what might actually be going on outside that he also brings to mind an oft-quoted line spoken to him in ""The Big Lebowski"" ""Youre not wrong Walter. Youre just an a - - hole."" Winstead also makes a terrific heroine; her character is a problem-solver not a freaker-outer and its a stressful sort of fun watching her devise one plan after another to get around Howards creepy patriarchal rules. As for the denouement -- again the less said the better. But suffice it to say Trachtenberg anchors his film firmly in the J.J. Abrams universe of mysterious happenings (look closely and you may spot a visual shout-out to Abrams production company Bad Robot). Much has been said about Abrams having produced this one on the down-low while we were all busy kvelling about ""The Force Awakens."" This film shows hes still got a firm appreciation for the stuff thats low on budget but big on chills.

"10 Cloverfield Lane | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; 10-cloverfield-lane ) 10 Cloverfield Lane (United States 2016) March 10 2016 A movie review by James Berardinelli When J.J. Abrams released Cloverfield in 2008 it arrived cloaked in secrecy. Now some eight years later the films so-called ""blood relative"" (Abrams term not mine) comes with a similar marketing strategy. Going-in viewers are unlikely to be certain what to expect and emerging they might not be quite sure exactly what they witnessed.  The problems with 10 Cloverfield Lane result from attempts to tie it however tenuously to the earlier movie. Take away the disappointing disjointed and anti-climactic final act and this is an effective white-knuckle psychological thriller. And although the final 15 minutes dont ruin the movie they detract from its better parts. The premise is simple following a car accident Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) awakens to find herself chained to a wall in what appears to be a basement. She soon learns that she has been brought to this place by the hulking rather scary Howard (John Goodman) for her ""own good."" The basement is actually a doomsday bunker with three occupants survivalist Howard; his former handyman Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.); and Michelle whom Howard rescued from her smashed car. In the outside world all is not well. According to Howard apocalyptic events have occurred. His plan is for the three of them to shelter in place and wait it out until things are safe. Michelle thinks hes crazy. Emmett isnt so certain. By using double-bluffs and red herrings director Dan Trachtenberg crafts a claustrophobic psychological thriller that hums along nicely. Hitchcockian misdirection abounds. From moment-to-moment were never quite sure who (or what) Howard really is a lonely savior whose paranoia has been validated or a creepy kidnapper acting out a twisted delusion? Is the situation outside the bunker real or a figment of Howards warped mind? Did ""the Ruskies"" attack? Or aliens? Or nothing at all? Perhaps Howard faked the mutilations of some pigs to ""prove"" that the air isnt safe? So many questions... At times 10 Cloverfield Lane has a similar vibe as the TV series Lost which not coincidentally was produced by Abrams Bad Robot Productions. While keeping us guessing 10 Cloverfield Lane provides several nail-biting scenes. Sound is an important part of how the tension is amplified - every noise is loud and the insistent musical score throbs. 10 Cloverfield Lane doesnt employ ""found footage"" like the original Cloverfield. Camera movement is smooth and clean and the shots are composed to emphasize how cramped and uncomfortable the limited space is. The movie is presented from Michelles perspective and its tone varies with her mood. Her opinion of Howard and the situation changes frequently and the film reflects that. Theres even a goofy musical montage that shows the three companions playing board games and putting together puzzles like any ""normal"" family. Winstead is a good choice to play the heroine because shes strong yet feminine. (She previously appeared as Bruce Willis daughter in the fourth Die Hard film and as the lead in the prequel to John Carptenters The Thing.) John Goodman is a perfect Howard - Goodman has the rare talent of being able to play both a cuddly likeable guy and a frighteningly dangerous one. In 10 Cloverfield Lane hes asked to do both. The films failing is that in linking it to Cloverfield it abandons the elements that made the majority of the movie effective. The final fifteen minutes dont work as a way to wrap up this story or as an introduction to a larger (generic) canvas. They feel tacked-on and rushed. Nevertheless as weak as the conclusion may be it doesnt obfuscate the good things to precede it. 10 Cloverfield Lane is packed with suspense and tension and offers some of the best bait-and-switch work of any recent psychological thriller. Its easy to forgive any missteps toward the end when considering the entire package. 10 Cloverfield Lane (United States 2016) Director Dan Trachtenberg Cast Mary Elizabeth Winstead John Goodman John Gallagher Jr. Screenplay Josh Campbell amp; Matthew Stuecken and Damien Chazelle Cinematography Jeff Cutter Music Bear McCreary U.S. Distributor Paramount Pictures Run Time 145 U.S. Release Date 2016-03-11 MPAA Rating ""PG-13"" (Violence Disturbing Images Profanity) Genre Science Fiction/Thriller Subtitles none Theatrical Aspect Ratio 2.351 Comments Add Comment Three...better movies of this genre Inception (2010) Pitch Black (2000) Thing The (1982) worse movies of this genre Self/Less (2015) Knowing (2009) Watchmen (2009) Three...better movies of Mary Elizabeth Winstead Sky High (2005) Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010) Spectacular Now The (2013) worse movies of Mary Elizabeth Winstead Good Day to Die Hard A (2013) Live Free or Die Hard (2007) Final Destination 3 (2006) Three...better movies of John Goodman Monsters Inc.

John Gallagher Jr. left Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Goodman in ""10 Cloverfield Lane."" (Michele K. Short / Paramount Pictures) Mark OlsenContact Reporter Until just a few months ago almost no one had heard of the movie ""10 Cloverfield Lane."" In an era of years-long production and promotional campaigns it was startling for a movie to suddenly materialize especially from powerhouse producer J.J. Abrams. The filmmaking team was presumably looking to emulate the nimble digital-era freedom of Beyonce or Louis C.K. to just drop something new and fully formed on an unsuspecting public and let people figure it out for themselves.The new movie is loosely connected in spirit if in neither tone nor style to 2008s ""Cloverfield"" another film that trafficked in pre-release mystery and misdirection. Not a sequel in any conventional sense the new film exchanges the originals found footage confusion and frenzy for the more composed constrained look and feel of a tense suspense thriller. Abrams has likened the films to siblings similar but individual while director Dan Trachtenberg said recently that the films are on different timelines within the same universe.

Abrams dropped a surprise mystery box onto the lap of an unsuspecting public. The markedly private Bad Robot production company was making another ""Cloverfield"" movie. And surprise twist the new feature titled ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" would be released in theaters in a mere... (Meredith Woerner) So ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" arrives on a wave of enthusiasm generated partly by its serial connection and also by its rushing momentum of surprised discovery. As with its predecessor the movie manages to be smart and shallow at the same time satisfied with a disposable showmans flair rather than pushing on to something deeper and more resonant. It is designed to be fun efficient and accessible and delivers precisely and exactly on that and nothing more. The film follows three people Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) Howard (John Goodman) and Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) taking refuge inside an underground survivalist bunker after what may or may not have been some kind of attack from an enemy of unknown origin. (Bradley Cooper makes a voice cameo on the phone as the man Winsteads character is leaving behind as the story begins.)Howard built the well-stocked retreat and brought Michelle down there after a car accident but as he slowly reveals himself to be an unreliable source of information Michelle questions if she is there for her protection or his paranoia and pleasure. 10 Cloverfield Lane Trailer for ""10 Cloverfield Lane.""

See more videos Having been retrofitted to the realm of ""Cloverfield"" from a project originally called ""The Cellar"" the films script is credited to Josh Campbell Matt Stuecken and ""Whiplashs"" Damien Chazelle from a story by Campbell and Stuecken. The film is at its best when it settles into being an uneasy chamber drama as unfolding events confirm one interpretation of what is really happening until an equally believable counter-fact comes along. And it is at its worst when it feels compelled to start answering its own questions and forced to satisfy the imperatives of conforming to a new franchise.With so much of its story whittled to three people alone in a warren of rooms the performances are of unusual importance here. Winstead nicely unites the dynamic dramatic work she has done in films such as ""Smashed"" and ""Faults"" with that from more conventional action and horror roles in movies like ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" and ""The Thing."" Gallaghers role is largely thankless and vaguely functional which makes Goodman the films not-so-secret weapon. He handily pivots in ways sometimes subtle and sometimes not between seeming like a polite harmless conspiracy nut and/or a disturbed creep.

""10 Cloverfield Lane"" posits that perhaps the real damage is to be done not by outside invaders but by those already among us; that perhaps the greatest danger comes from those who are not as they present themselves to be. The movie is sharp and exciting in the moment but also content to allow anything more genuinely troubling to disappear on the way out the door.Follow on Twitter IndieFocus------------10 Cloverfield LaneMPAA rating PG-13 for thematic material including frightening sequences of threat with some violence and brief languageRunning time 1 hour and 45 minutesPlaying In wide releaseMOREMarvels Spider-Man revealed in the Captain America Civil War trailerJ.J.

Short / Paramount Pictures)""Cloverfield"" was a monster movie that wasnt really a monster movie and ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is its sequel that isnt really a sequel. If theres one thing the two films have in common its their aversion to doing things the way audiences have grown accustomed to expect.That can be a good thing and a bad thing. On the one hand ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" works as a minimalist tightly wound thriller about three people living in an underground bunker. Something is keeping them down there but were never quite sure what and that mystery drives the films narrative.On the other hand the word ""Cloverfield"" in the title keeps viewers continually off-balance knowing that whatever lurks outside could be that monster that tore up New York in the found footage 2008 original film. Or maybe its not? Would ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" play the same by any other name?If producer J.J. Abrams (""Star Wars"" ""Star Trek"") had his way he probably would have dropped ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" into theaters with no advance notice and no title the Hollywood version of a surprise album release. But thats not how movies work not with tens of millions of dollars at stake. So he gave viewers a tease -- a title and trailers that reveal as little as possible -- and put the rest on good faith (and spoiler-free discussion forums).Taking the ""Cloverfield"" out of it -- well call it ""Bunker"" just for sport -- the movie opens with Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) leaving her Louisiana apartment in a hurry. Shes leaving behind her boyfriend after a sudden split and as she drives into the night a news report about a massive power outage comes on her radio. Shes suddenly sideswiped by a truck her car rolls into a ditch and she wakes up in the underground shelter of Howard (John Goodman) a survivalist with a ""blackbelt in conspiracy theory.""Thats according to Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) who also is in the hole hiding out from a mysterious force that has supposedly wiped out life above ground. Michelle has nothing to go on but the word of Howard and Emmett and her attempts to escape are clouded by uncertainty. Is the air outside really toxic? Is she better off inside? And is Howard -- whose initial story doesnt entirely add up -- any better than the ""Cloverfield"" monster?""Bunker"" is like a bottle episode of a TV show where the action is confined to a small space. Madness and paranoia creep in and the outside threats and hints of supernatural menace make it play like a taut ""Twilight Zone"" piece. First-time director Dan Trachtenberg working from a script by Josh Campbell Matthew Stuecken and Damien Chazelle slowly builds tension as he peels back layers of the story eventually building to a rousing climax that delivers some unexpected -- or perhaps expected given the films origins -- thrills.Winstead gives a strong performance as a captive who never gives up her fight. Goodman strikes a fine balance between nurturing caregiver and frightening captor even if to the detriment of the story his end game is never really made clear.There are points where ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" threatens to grow tedious but Trachtenberg manages to keeps things on track. In a surprise twist ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" winds up widening what is now an expanding ""Cloverfield"" universe a nifty feat for such a small controlled film. Its a testament to the power of J.J. Abrams and his elusive anti-marketing and the way he plays with the psychology of moviegoers. In this universe audience expectations loom just as large as the big monster.agrahamdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/grahamorama10 Cloverfield LaneGRADE BRated PG-13 for thematic material including frightening sequences of threat with some violence and brief languageRunning time 120 minutes 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1pbNr5f TOP VIDEOS Oakland County Sheriff car chase052East Detroit Schools CEO superintendent ready to work together333Trump denies he encouraged Russia to hack Clinton emails035Donald Trump discusses pulling out of NAFTA tariff for Ford123Zoom Gas Station029Surveillance video of breaking and entering029Highland Park eco village brings basics back to Avalon Street2572016 Festival of Chariots parade154Debbie Dingell adresses unity town hall meeting118World Peace mural135 MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/columnists/adam-graham/2016/03/10/movie-review-paranoia-runs-high-cloverfield-lane/81615094/,200,cloverfield10,cloverfield,detroitnews

And then the kicker Credits that revealed it was produced by J.J. Abrams and included the almighty watchword ""Cloverfield"" in the title. Here was ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" a film that was set to hit theaters a mere two months after its first bit of marketing appeared in the public space. Rumors of a ""Cloverfield"" sequel have persisted for years kicked up almost immediately after Matt Reeves 2008 found-footage monster movie hit theaters and enduring on long after Reeves and Abrams both moved on to larger things (from the revitalized ""Planet of the Apes"" franchise to a little something called ""Star Wars""). But it was hard to imagine what exactly a ""Cloverfield"" sequel would look like who it would follow or how it would actually fit into the interestingly assembled universe. Dan Trachtenbergs ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" wades through that conundrum with a clever strategy Not a direct sequel to Reeves original feature its been touted as both a ""spiritual successor"" and a ""blood relative"" to the first film (though it does leave open the opportunity for ""Cloverfield"" fans to deconstruct and analyze plenty of material and they will surely be able to draw connections and conclusions from their findings). It should please both hardened fans and thrill-seeking newbies. Simply put if you like ""Cloverfield"" youre going to like ""10 Cloverfield Lane."" But the films dont share a direct storyline any characters or even similar filming styles. Instead the films are kindred spirits. Reportedly retrofitted from a previous script known as ""The Cellar"" (penned by John Campbell and Matt Stuecken who get both a ""story by"" credit and a screenwriting nod on the feature) ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" was eventually reworked into its existing version with help from Damien Chazelle under the codename ""Valencia."" The film follows Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who we first meet as shes quickly packing her bags and getting the hell out of metaphorical Dodge (the film is set in Louisiana a nice counter-balance to the city-set terrors of ""Cloverfield""). But Michelle isnt fleeing any outsized monsters; shes actually just leaving her fiance who promptly calls her up and begs her to come home. Answering while driving is never a great idea but that point is hammered home quite swiftly when Michelle is knocked off the road in a snappy car accident that sets the tone for the rest of the rest of the film. Michelles nightmare is only beginning however because when she wakes up from the accident shes chained up in some dudes creepy basement bunker. John Goodmans Howard is a study in extremes one who demands that Michelle thank him for his generosity in saving her (because the world outside has seemingly ended conveniently while Michelle was unconscious) while also  so very clearly harboring a nefarious agenda Trachtenberg ratchets up the tension with ease and even small things -- the way Howard makes a fist the appearance of a photograph an oddly jammed air shaft -- are filled with a stomach-turning dread that keeps the film chugging along until its explosive last act. ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" doesnt dance around the truth for too long but the film is built to force its audience to draw quick conclusions about Howard and his aims. Is he a doomsday loony who got lucky and helped out a woman in need at the most opportune of times? Or is he a lying psychopath who has cooked up one hell of a story to tell his latest captive? The film eventually explores other options but keeps its central framework unchanged. It is like most things sprung from Abrams so-called mystery box hard to explain without spoiling and so much of the joy of Trachtenbergs film is its many surprises twists and change-ups. Still its not entirely impossible to discuss because while ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is genuinely thrilling and often quite terrifying the film doesnt toy with its audience when it comes to bigger meatier reveals. The bunker is eventually revealed as an oddly homey place filled with carefully concealed secrets and even another occupant (John Gallagher Jr.) who only further complicates matters. As Michelle seesaws back and forth in her understanding and acceptance of the situation -- and on a deeper level of Howard himself -- so too does the film. Despite the bizarre situation she finds herself in Michelle remains a relatable figure as the suspense continues to build. Essentially functioning as the ""final girl"" of horror movie lore for the duration of the movie Michelle makes entirely rationale decisions that will have no impatient viewers yelling that the screen. (This is not the kind of character who runs up the stairs when everyone in the audience screams at her to scoot out the door.) Filled with considerable dread and mystery ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" functions just fine as a standalone genre title. But as a spiritual sequel to the original it builds out the so-called ""Cloververse"" far better than could be expected from even the most straightforward of tales. Grade A- ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" opens in wide release on Friday March 11.

Barry Hertz The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Mar. 10 2016 158PM EST Last updated Thursday Mar. 10 2016 316PM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Dan Trachtenberg Written by Josh Campbell Matthew Stuecken Damien Chazelle Starring John Goodman Mary Elizabeth Winstead John Gallagher Jr. Classification PG Genre scifi Year 2016 Country USA Language English Its not often I feel compelled to open film reviews with quotes from the television series Family Guy but critiquing 10 Cloverfield Lane requires all manner of unusual trickery. So In one of Family Guy s earlier episodes - back when it was both crude and clever instead of now merely being idiotically crude - our cartoon hero Peter Griffin is presented by a salesman with the choice of either a boat or ""the mystery box."" Peters sensible wife Lois says of course theyll take the boat. ""Hold on Lois"" interrupts Peter. ""A boats a boat. But the mystery box could be anything. It could even be a boat"" And thats the best way to describe 10 Cloverfield Lane on the surface its a simple thriller but thanks to producer J.J. Abramss both brilliant and annoying flair for marketing its also a mystery box full of unfettered promise. Why it could even be a simple thrillerA bit of background before going any further down Abramss mystery-box rabbit hole (which like most rabbit holes these days will lead you to scarily obsessive forums on Reddit). In the summer of 2007 Abrams and his creative team unleashed Cloverfield onto an unsuspecting world. Its trailer debuted in front of Transformers (the first one; ah it was such an innocent time) depicting what seemed to be a conventional romantic drama about millennials and their cool hipster house parties. Quickly though it revealed itself to be a stealth sci-fi blockbuster. The clip offered no stars and no title ending simply on the haunting image of Lady Libertys decapitated head rolling down the streets of Manhattan and a release date.The hype machine soon went into overdrive - what was this infuriatingly unnamed thing that promised big spectacles and bigger mysteries? How could we have never heard of it before? Insanity Abrams and company teased the rest of the game expertly planting faux websites and Easter eggs across the Internet holding back any actual details of the film - such as its plot or characters or title - until the last possible moment before release. Cloverfield as it would eventually be called was a gift of pure mystery-box intrigue inside it could be anything you wanted it to be. You just had to buy a ticket and open it for yourself ... at which point it was revealed to be a neat if not exactly revelatory addition to the monster-movie canon.Now almost a decade after Cloverfield first gave a moviegoers pangs of exasperated expectation comes 10 Cloverfield Lane a spiritual successor to the original beast in more ways than one. For this latest film too was conceived inside the dark confines of Abramss beloved mystery box so much so that the original screenplay had nothing to do with the series and the small cast only found out about the title and thus its brand identity after filming concluded.This almost preposterous level of chicanery can be viewed as both a strength and weakness and some audiences will walk away from this new work confused maybe even angry. The title promises the monster mayhem of the original Cloverfield though on a smaller scale - as the very words ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" subtly imply were spending time in just a small rural corner of this storytelling universe. But if not even the cast were aware of their canonical connections to the original film was it even worth making a connection at all? Is 10 Cloverfield Lane just a simple genre exercise that would have gone unnoticed had it not been retrofitted to appeal to a franchise-hungry market?Yes probably - but thank god Abrams decided to add the film to his collection of tricks because this is a near-masterpiece an intimate and nerve-wracking shocker that deserves as big an audience as the mystery box can conjure.The less known about the plot the better but the bare bones of the narrative find Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) waking up in the underground bunker of conspiracy nut Howard (John Goodman) who warns of a dangerous ""attack"" that has rendered the outside world uninhabitable (basically Room meets War of the Worlds). From there the script (by relative newbies Josh Campbell and Matthew Stuecken with an assist from Whiplashs Damien Chazelle) takes a series of delightfully unexpected turns all leading to a climax that is both tense and surprising even for those expecting a straight-up Cloverfield 2.And unlike Matt Reeves shaky-cam direction on the original found-footage Cloverfield new director Dan Trachtenberg holds the camera with a grip so determined and steady that its shocking to discover that hes making his feature debut here. This is a work of immense confidence and the restraint Trachtenberg asks of his leads is remarkable - Winstead and Goodman quietly excel in what could have easily been wild loud caricatures. Their measured and calculated turns prove that not all genre films need to dispense with subtlety.But perhaps 10 Cloverfield Lane is not so much a mystery box of a film as it is another kind of fabled container the one described in the paradox of Schrodingers Cat. The thought experiment designed by Austrian physicist Erwin Schrodinger imagines a cat trapped inside a box with poison and asks you to consider that the animal is both simultaneously dead and alive at least until the box is opened and the state of the felines health can be empirically observed.Its easy to go into 10 Cloverfield Lane with the hopes that its everything you want it to be - a monster movie that resolves all the hanging threads from the original film say - but the film should not live or die based on your expectations alone. Just open the damn thing up. Youll be glad you did. Report Typo/Error Follow us on Twitter GlobeArts Also on The Globe and Mail How J.J.

Im genuinely curious. If youre checking out a review of 10 Cloverfield Lane the enigmatic not-really-a-sequel to 2008s found-footage monster flick Cloverfield you must be interested in the movie. But if youre interested in the movie you really shouldnt be looking at any reviews of 10 Cloverfield Lane. So again why are you reading this? Opening in theatres Friday after being revealed just eight weeks ago with a surprise trailer 10 Cloverfield Lane is like a feature-length Twilight Zone episode and has been called as much by producer J.J. Abrams and first-time director Dan Trachtenberg. Which means the more you know about it the less fun it will be. But since youre doggedly persistent lets try to dance around this without moving too much furniture. 10 Cloverfield Lane is the story of a young woman named Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead the rainbow-coiffed object of Michael Ceras affection in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World) who after being injured in a car crash wakes up in an underground shelter of some sort chained to a wall. Shes the unwilling guest of the bunkers owner Howard (John Goodman) who tells Michelle shes being held captive for her own safety. He plucked her from the wreck of her car and brought her to his subterranean shelter just as the world was ending see. Theres been an attack. Maybe chemical maybe nuclear. Maybe Russians. Maybe Martians. Howards lair - complete with a comfortable living room robust air filtration system a triple-locked hatch and Howards naive but amiable neighbour Emmet (The Newsrooms John Gallagher Jr.) - is Michelles new home until the fallout clears... in a year or two. But hey there are boardgames and movies on VHS. So settle in. And above all behave. Goodman who so often plays the genial sidekick is great as the darkly inscrutable heavy-breathing Howard. Hes creepy yet seems to really care about his two young charges. Hes menacing - especially when his temper flares - yet sometimes vulnerable. You wouldnt want to be stuck in a bunker with him but you might want him on your side if the post-apocalyptic poop were to hit the fan. Winstead is also awesome as the resourceful Michelle - the movie dispenses with the woman-gets-stronger-through-adversity formula and has her MacGyvering from the get-go - and while Gallaghers Louisiana accent seems to ebb and flow like the Gulf Coast tide youre never sure what Emmets deal is or how the whole thing is going to play out. Thats the thing about 10 Cloverfield Lane its a thrilling little guessing game. Has there really been a chemical attack? Is everyone else really dead? Whatever happened to Howards daughter? Clues about whats going on are sprinkled throughout but just when you think youve decoded Howards intentions something pops up that lends credence to his craziness. And then something else makes him seem even more monstrous. OK now go away. For real. You dont need to hear the rest. No? Really? Fine. Im the kind of person who thinks that even knowing a twist exists in a movie is a form of spoiler but since youre clearly not... part of what makes 10 Cloverfield Lane fun is the ending as all is made clear in the final 20 or so minutes. I found it to be a wonderfully tangy cherry on this compact little sundae but some might see the jarring shift as a dollop of horseradish on their apple pie. (Which to be fair Ive never actually tried. It could be delicious.) Despite its genetic connection to a flick about a leviathan ravaging Manhattan 10 Cloverfield Lane is small tight movie set in a small tight space. Its a good time. Its a talker. It has a payoff that will delight some and alienate others. And it will surely be spoiled by the same kind of people who shouted ""Snape kills Dumbledore"" - but you cant worry too much about them. Because hopefully you didnt read any of this.

"10 Cloverfield Lane review Mary Elizabeth Winstead John Goodman thrill in monster mashup sequel - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies 10 Cloverfield Lane review Mary Elizabeth Winstead John Goodman thrill in monster mashup sequel 10 Cloverfield Lane Michele K. Short / AP John Goodman from left Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr. in a scene from ""10 Cloverfield Lane."" John Goodman from left Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr. in a scene from ""10 Cloverfield Lane."" (Michele K. Short / AP) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is only nominally a sequel to ""Cloverfield"" the scruffy lil 2008 monster movie in which New York idiots ran around filming themselves while their city became the plaything of an intergalactic tourist. The new picture is that earlier films neighbor down the street. And the neighbor lives in an underground bunker where most of the story is set.Are there monsters? Well. Theyre alluded to in the title and in the trailer when John Goodman and Mary Elizabeth Winstead react fearfully to the sounds of something big and rumbly aboveground. But its best to approach this crafty intriguing offshoot as its own thing. And this time you actually notice the people. Dont get me wrong. (Please. Anything but that.) I enjoyed the first ""Cloverfield."" Its found-footage aesthetic was literally nausea-inducing but its delay tactics in revealing the creature were clever and suspenseful. Also the films conclusion had a nice vicious finality to it.""10 Cloverfield Lane"" was initially conceived as a movie unrelated to ""Cloverfield"" in any way from title to tail. It begins with a breakup a breathless wordless prologue in which Michelle (Winstead) under serious duress is frantically packing up and piling into her car to get away from her unseen boyfriend. Then she gets creamed by another car on the Louisiana highway and she takes a few terrible rolls off the median and the worst of the crash is intercut arrestingly with the opening titles on screen. All this is in the first few minutes. Michelle awakens with an IV in her arm and her leg chained to the wall and its all very see-""Saw."" But it isnt really. Is it? Her abductor/captor Howard played by Goodman claims to be her savior. In his well-appointed fully furnished underground lair this paranoid survivalist has previously captured and confined a handyman neighbor (played by John Gallagher Jr.) who becomes Michelles confidant.Howard claims that theres been an attack either by the Russians or space invaders and the air outside is no longer breathable. Early in ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" we see a bloodied woman begging to be let inside arguing that shes only a little bit infected. But this is not a four-character piece; its a triangle and the script by Josh Campbell and Matthew Stuecken revised by co-writer Damien Chazelle of ""Whiplash"" and the forthcoming ""La-La Land"" keeps its focus on the three wary figures in extreme confinement. Trailer 10 Cloverfield Lane Monsters come in many forms. In theaters March 11th. Monsters come in many forms. In theaters March 11th. See more videos So its a little bit of ""Room"" a little bit of ""War of the Worlds"" and producer J.J. Abrams involvement ensures some dashes of unexpected humor (whether you believe the levity in this context or not) along with director Dan Trachtenbergs facility for occasional brutally effective bursts of violence. Goodmans very good taking care of job one which is to keep us guessing Howards intentions. And Winstead is even better within the parameters of this genre mashup.The setup is pure if sanitized PG-13 exploitation guided by the viewpoint and exploits of a tank-topped heroine in distress. Yet ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" doesnt let on what its up to moment to moment. Winsteads shift into action mode works; her wry affecting underplaying keeps the film companionable in its clammy way. And in a movie crammed with odd contrasts the most striking may be the clinical crispness of the digital photography up against the old-school strings and analog vibe of Bear McCrearys musical score.

Despite its title Dan Trachtenbergs Twilight Zone-style thriller actually lives at two addresses. First theres the minimalist claustrophobic drama that unspools in an underground bunker one thats riven by mistrust. If youre a fan of sweaty post-apocalyptic handwringing lengthy scenes of problem-solving and those rare occasions when movies feel like live theater this is where youll want the film to linger. Then theres the maximalist action flick (no spoilers here) that 10 Cloverfield Lane becomes--perhaps unavoidably given its arbitrary attachment to 2008s monster mash Cloverfield. The relocation is a letdown after so much exquisitely concentrated old-school craft. Right from the start you know youre in confident hands. Bear McCrearys frenetic orchestral score accompanies a teary yet wordless breakup as Mary Elizabeth Winstead--the young impressive actor with a determined jawline like Sigourney Weavers--hangs up on her boyfriend leaving behind a diamond ring and taking to the road with a bottle of Scotch. A car crash brings her down. She awakens bloodied and nervous chained to the wall of a cell. Her captor (John Goodman channeling his creepy Barton Fink side) tells her an ""attack"" has happened rendering the outside world uninhabitable. And we see just enough of that to wonder if hes right. Maybe hes her savior whose only crime is having a jukebox full of Tommy James and the Shondells. Or maybe not. Enough cant be said about this section of 10 Cloverfield Lane--which fills up the vast majority of its running time. Basically its an electrifying three-person play as the resourceful Winstead the complexly furious Goodman and Tony-winner John Gallagher Jr. (portraying a lucky neighbor who made it down to the refuge) hash it out in scenes that impart the nauseating futility of George Romeros mall-barricaded Dawn of the Dead. If only the film were content with that. But producer J.J. Abrams a brilliant marketer eventually has to open his ""mystery box"" and the intelligence level plummets. Never mind. Go anyway and watch the arrival of the mighty Winstead whod do fine in a Room of her own.

Abrams Made a Secret Sequel ""I dont know if this is going to work"" the Hollywood super-producer confesses about mystery project And here I am about to tell you about a movie that you shouldnt let anyone tell you about. So Ill skip to a few spoiler-free essentials. First 10 Cloverfield Lane comes loaded with everything a psychological thriller needs to shatter your nerves -- and then kicks it up a notch. And oh about that title. If the Cloverfield shout-out makes you think this movie is a direct sequel to that low-budget found-footage 2008 horror show about monsters invading a Manhattan filled with hard-partying millennials youre on the wrong track. But not completely wrong. Theres a vibe a definite vibe. Certainly Howard feels it. As played by the great John Goodman Howard is a Louisiana survivalist whos spent years preparing for the worst -- terrorists Russians aliens suspicious neighbors doomsday Howard doesnt give a damn. Hes ready and tucked away in an underground bunker that looks as comfy and chintzy as the family room in a 1950s sitcom. Feeling impervious to nuclear radiation or extra-terrestrial juju Howard can ride out the storm alone. But see hes not alone. Theres Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead is dynamite and then some) a determined woman driving hard to get away from a boyfriend (voiced on the phone by Bradley Cooper). Her car crashed -- or did it? -- outside Howards bunker and now hes taken her in and tied her up. Why? Ill never tell. The third occupant of the bunker is Emmett (the most excellent John Gallagher Jr.) a neighbor who knew Howards grown daughter who is living in well parts unknown. Is Howard lying about whats outside or telling the truth? Goodman grabbing his juiciest screen role in years plays it for every tingling note of mirth and menace. You cant take your eyes off him. And cheers to first-time director Dan Trachtenberg who knows how to let the claustrophobia of the bunker seep into your blood stream until youre jumping at everything that goes bump in the night. Carried along by the beats of Bear McCrearys pulsating score 10 Cloverfield Lane seems eager to play itself like a B-movie throwaway. Its anything but. Cloverfield producer J.J. Abrams who just did some Star Wars thing is back on the team and Damien Chazelle (Whiplash) wrote the script with Josh Campbell and Matthew Stuecken. Translation Youre in good hands.

(Heck his own wife and daughter couldnt stand the rant n rave and just because he misses his little girl something fierce doesnt mean hes about to change his ways.) John Goodman should be aces at this kind of amiable menace (see also Barton Fink) but the allusion of the title -- J.J. Abrams producer of 2008s camcorder monster movie Cloverfield produces again here -- generates more suspense (or maybe just curiosity) than anything that happens underground. Its a pity; the satisfaction of that curiosity comes shortly after things could have gotten seriously scary down below for our resourceful heroine (Mary Elizabeth Winstead always threatened but never panicked or even vulnerable). First-time director Dan Trachtenberg is overly reliant on close-ups and big noises in his pursuit of nerve-wracking drama while third-wheel bunker-boy John Gallagher Jr. provides heart and humor but ultimately bogs things down. 2016. -- Matthew Lickona This movie is not currently in theaters.

Michele K. Short/Courtesy of Paramount Pictures hide caption toggle caption Michele K. Short/Courtesy of Paramount Pictures John Goodman as Howard; Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Michelle in 10 Cloverfield Lane. Michele K. Short/Courtesy of Paramount Pictures [This is a film its very hard to talk about at all without spoiling at least the premise and the basic setup but this review does its level best not to go beyond that point.] ""What does this have to do with Cloverfield?"" Putting that question out of your mind during 10 Cloverfield Lane is ignoring the elephant in the room but everything about the film from its out-of-the-blue viral campaign to its thrilling commitment to misdirection makes it possible. Some connections eventually emerge as might be expected from one of producer J.J. Abrams puzzlebox narratives but 10 Cloverfield Lane is not another found-footage War of the Worlds scenario. And it doesnt take place in the wide-open spaces of a city under siege either. For the longest time it appears that the Cloverfield franchise is united mainly by the aesthetic principle of offscreen space -- not the catchiest hook but an enormously effective one. The obvious reason the two films connect so thinly is that 10 Cloverfield Lane wasnt originally conceived as a sort-of sequel but retrofitted like the chainsaw Bruce Campbell attaches to his arm in Evil Dead II. In sharp contrast to the shaky-cam of Cloverfield first-time director Dan Trachtenberg gives the opening scenes a classic Hitchcockian quality nodding specifically to Janet Leighs dash out of town in Psycho and laying on a muscular score (by Bear McCreary) in homage to Bernard Herrmann. Also like Hitchcock the story takes a decisive turn once a car peels off the road. That car belongs to Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) a Louisiana woman whos first shown hastily packing her things in a suitcase and a box and rushing out of her apartment leaving her wedding ring behind. Shortly after an evening pitstop for fuel Michelle gets in a car accident that sends her careening down an embankment. When she awakens she finds herself hooked to an IV drip in an unadorned cement bunker with her leg handcuffed to a pipe. Before she can improvise her way out of trouble her captor comes thundering through the door. His name is Howard (John Goodman) he explains and contrary to appearances he saved Michelle from the wreck and is currently protecting her from threats unknown. Theres reason to believe hes right. Howard claims that after the accident there was a chemical attack that rendered the air unbreathable and being the cheerful paranoiac he is hed built an underground shelter for just such an occasion. Along with a third resident named Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) the two of them have enough supplies to wait out the apocalypse for a year or two when the toxicity has presumably passed. Howard is a disturbing guy who lords over Michelle and Emmett like a belligerent father but any attempt to escape risks the likelihood of instant death the moment they peek their heads above ground. All this may sound like the set-up to an M. Night Shyamalan twist and certainly 10 Cloverfield Lane does have the obligation to pay off its Twilight Zone premise. But Trachtenberg and his screenwriters Josh Campbell and Matthew Stuecken take advantage of the shelters tight quarters which contribute to the expected pressure-cooker atmosphere of suspicion and hostility but also open up the punch-drunk comedy of people going mad with boredom. Howard may be a controlling monster but hes got a kick-ass jukebox and hes always up for board games or late-night viewings of Pretty In Pink on VHS. (Just be sure to compliment him on his spaghetti.) Goodmans ability to vacillate between regular-guy jocularity and Biblical fury has made him a Coen brothers favorite since Barton Fink and his performance helps modulate the films stomach-clenching tonal shifts. But Winstead is every bit as good as the frightened yet resourceful heroine who has to make difficult decisions about if when and how to act and validate the serpentine logic of the script. Their battle of wills adds a substance to 10 Cloverfield Lane that the improvising ninnies of the original Cloverfield couldnt muster despite its novel perspective on the monster movie. The gimmickry eventually arrives -- and god help us the Cloverfield ""mythology"" -- but by then the film has succeeded thoroughly on its own terms.

Opens Friday at major theatres. 14AWhether or not 10 Cloverfield Lane is a ""real"" sequel to the 2008 monster movie Cloverfield is the least concern of this brainy thriller. From its Hitchcock opening to its eye-popping ending Dan Trachtenbergs feature debut keeps us wondering about whats really going on even as we root for Mary Elizabeth Winsteads spunky entrapped protagonist.Article Continued BelowThe story credited to Josh Campbell Matthew Stuecken and Whiplash writer/director Damien Chazelle actually existed apart from Cloverfield. It has been dragged into service and bent to the will of a production posse led by J.J. Abrams the Cloverfield head honcho and Star Wars rebooter who certainly knows about profitably retooling an older property. (Thankfully the queasy Cloverfield shaky-cam conceit has been largely abandoned.)Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Goodman in the suspenseful sequel 10 Cloverfield Lane.  (Michele K. Short / Paramount Pictures)  Most of the narrative unfolds underground in the farmhouse bunker that Winsteads Michelle finds herself in after she awakens from the car crash of the opening credits. Running from a bad romance her mind wasnt on the road. Now she must focus on her mysterious current imprisonment.Turns out shes the ""lucky"" guest of survivalist Howard (a marvelously sinister John Goodman) who claims he took her in just before a global chemical attack -- maybe by the Russians or even the Martians theorizes wild-eyed Howard who seriously believes either threat possible.Hes been preparing for just such a disaster for years turning his home into a climate-controlled fortress with the assistant of neighbouring handyman Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) whom Howard has also taken under his wing.What if Howard is lying and his intentions are of the standard psycho-killer kind? He seems a few haystacks short of a harvest although gruffly polite. Would it be better or worse if hes telling the truth and a poisoned world lies just outside these hermetically sealed walls? What are those strange noises from above and that ominous low rumble?These are the calculations all must make participant and viewer but Michelle is determined not to be the passive victim of either dread scenario. Winsted excels as the distressed damsel who requires no male rescuer. Trachtenberg and his screenwriters pile on the terror tropes almost laughably so. They brazenly lift from old Twilight Zone episodes the indie horror Right at Your Door and likely even from Quebecer Denis Cotes Curling which made better use of the pop song ""I Think Were Alone Now"" for its backwoods creep show.A startling third-act change-up gives 10 Cloverfield Lane its own identity exceeding the disappointing original film and making the prospect of the inevitable Cloverfield trilogy promising rather than daunting. Abrams and his co-conspirators have verily created a monster but its growing up and doing them proud.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Michael OSullivan March 10 Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) awakens inside the fortified bunker of a man (John Goodman) who claims to have saved her from an imminent apocalypse of some kind in ""10 Cloverfield Lane."" (Michele K. Short/Paramount Pictures) If ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is as J.J. Abrams has described it a ""blood relative"" of the producers thriller ""Cloverfield"" its a bit more grown-up than that found-footage monster movie. Although scary and intense the 2008 tale about a group of 20-somethings making their way through a Manhattan thats under attack by a creature straight out of Japans Toho Studios was annoyingly mannered with dark and grainy hand-held-camerawork matched only in its awkwardness by a script consisting largely of people shouting ""Oh my God"" While apparently neither a sequel nor a prequel ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" shares the earlier films DNA in that here too be monsters. The less said about them the better for anyone hoping to avoid spoilers but One looks like a cross between a pygmy hippo a lamprey and a mirror ball. Some come in human form. Fortunately the main actors -- John Goodman Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr. as a trio of subterranean bunker dwellers trying to hide out from an unspecified aboveground attack -- are all top notch delivering believably nuanced performances that range from the touching to the hilarious (and eventually to the harrowing). The filmmaking by first-time feature director Dan Trachtenberg is suitably claustrophobic and suspenseful working up to a level of stress that may be unhealthy for anyone with a weak heart. And the dialogue (by Josh Campbell Damien Chazelle and Matthew Stuecken) is sophisticated enough to allow room for moments of quiet reflection in between all the bats-in-the-belfry crazy. There are a few false notes. If the screenplay attempts to explain away the air filtration system that allows the protagonists to breathe after the atmosphere has become poisoned through a reference to an ""aquaponic system"" that allusion while silly is certainly no more preposterous than many examples of sci-fi mumbo-jumbo in other films. Most of the film is far more relatable. Thats because the people in it despite their extreme circumstances are very real. Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) provides comic relief in the tense ""10 Cloverfield Lane."" (Michele K. Short/Paramount Pictures) Goodmans Howard is the patriarch of the films little family which also consists of Michelle (Winstead) a woman fleeing a bad marriage who wakes up from a car accident to find herself handcuffed to a pipe in Howards lair and Emmett (Gallagher) a handyman who had helped Howard build the fallout shelter when it became clear (to Howard if no one else) that the sky was falling. At first Howard -- who insists that his motives are altruistic despite those cuffs -- seems to be the only person certain about how bad things have gotten up top. At one point Emmett the films comic relief wisecracks to Michelle that their benefactor has a ""black belt in conspiracy theory."" Although Howard makes allusions to ""Martians"" he seems initially sane enough. And when a woman (Suzanne Cryer) shows up banging on his door with the skin on her face peeling off it starts to look like he may be right. Goodmans performance while unhinged never veers into caricature. Similarly Winstead avoids the cliche of the tank-top-wearing bimbo/victim bringing an earthy self-reliance to her role. Like ""Cloverfield"" ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" raises almost as many questions as it answers. Where are these monsters from and what do they want? Both films look at the world in a form of tunnel vision ""Cloverfield"" through the lens of a camcorder and ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" through the smudged glass window of an underground bunker. Questions about what is going on in the broader world which linger long after the closing credits are less interesting at least in this latest film than the ones that have to do with the way we treat one another. A previous version of this article said the film was rated R. It is rated PG-13. This version has been corrected. 10 Cloverfield Lane (103 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for frightening images violence threatening behavior and some coarse language. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Short advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT In a survivalists bunker a young woman must decide whether shes been kidnapped or saved from doomsday. CAST Mary Elizabeth Winstead John Goodman John Gallagher Jr.RATED PG-13 (intense and sometimes bloody violence)LENGTH 143BOTTOM LINE An effectively tight tense thriller from the producer of 2008s ""Cloverfield."" Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays Michelle a 20-something escaping from adulthood in ""10 Cloverfield Lane."" Packing a suitcase but leaving behind her engagement ring she bolts from her apartment and drives into the night.

If Michelle was feeling trapped thats nothing compared to what happens after her car crash She awakes chained to a pipe in a windowless room. Her host Howard offers a mind-boggling explanation He saved her from a space-alien attack that has left Earths air unbreathable. ""Im sorry"" he says ""but no one is looking for you."" ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" shares a producer J.J. Abrams and part of its title with ""Cloverfield"" a sci-fi hit from 2008. This movie has been called a ""blood relative"" to that one but it has far more in common with tense claustrophobic thrillers like ""Misery"" ""Wait Until Dark"" or even ""Psycho."" 143 Movies10 Cloverfield Lane trailer With an empathetic Winstead (""The Spectacular Now"") as a woman clinging to her wits an excellent John Goodman as the questionable Howard and newcomer John Gallagher Jr. as a dim but decent guy named Emmett ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is as economical as a stage play but packs in plenty of visceral violence and visual surprises. Whether youve seen the first film or not this one is a thoroughly entertaining treat. advertisement | advertise on newsday Tightly directed by first-timer Dan Trachtenberg ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" packs a lot of action into its small space a bunker that disconcertingly resembles a cozy vacation cabin with wood-veneer paneling and a supply of board games. The films simple premise (one of the co-writers is Damien Chazelle of the Oscar-winning two-hander ""Whiplash"") offers multiple twists and turns as Michelle (and we) try to decide whether Howard is a savior or a sociopath. Goodman wavering from gruff kindness to chilling brutality is the wild card that keeps things consistently interesting. Like its predecessor ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is cleverly crafted; much praise should go to Ramsey Averys inventive set design Bear McCrearys Hitchcock-worthy score and the entire jolt-producing sound department. The less spoiled the better but suffice it to say that ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is effective unpredictable and loads of fun.

(Paramount Pictures/Michele K. Short) Movie review of ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" This horror film stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead as a young woman being held captive by a paranoid survivalist (John Goodman) in a well-stocked doomsday bunker. Rating 1.5 stars out of 4. Share story By Soren AndersenSeattle Times movie reviewer ""Waking up from a car accident a young woman finds herself in the basement of a man who says hes saved her life from a chemical attack that has turned all females over the age of 36 into a soft vaporous liquid which can be utilized as a disinfectant."" Reading that from promotional materials purportedly describing whats up in ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" ones natural response is ""??"" Alas I suspect that verbiage seems like part of a secretive scheme by producer J.J. Abrams and his creative team to conceal the true nature of the movie until it opened the better to fuddle the expectations of fans curious to know how he and his people followed up their surprise 2008 found-footage horror hit ""Cloverfield."" Movie Review 1/2   10 Cloverfield Lane with Mary Elizabeth Winstead John Goodman John Gallagher Jr. Directed by Dan Trachtenberg from a screenplay by Josh Campbell Matthew Stuecken and Damien Chazelle. 105 minutes. Rated PG-13 for thematic material including frightening sequences of threat with some violence and brief language. Several theaters. The fact is rather than something truly wild and way way off the wall ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is a variation on the ""dont go down into the basement"" school of scary moviemaking only this time with a 180-degree twist. Which is to say its a movie whose central premise is ""Dont leave the basement and climb toward the light."" And this time no found footage.

He chains her up. He tells her hes saved her from death by fallout following nuclear armageddon. Hes weird. Hes controlling. He may be lying about whats up there beyond the bunkers double-locked doors. For most of the picture hulking Howard is a mildly menacing host. Michelle is a smart resourceful woman able to convert a crutch into a spear and a shower curtain into a hazmat suit. Theres a third occupant (John Gallagher Jr.) who is ill-defined to the point of being almost inconsequential. Board games threats from Howard and desperate escape planning by Michelle take up most the picture. And then first-time feature director Dan Trachtenberg and the screenwriters apparently realizing that not much has been going on so far ramp up to a full-bore CG explosion extravaganza finale.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The P.T. Barnum of blockbuster salesmanship J.J. Abrams makes good movies and better ad campaigns; he doles out pre-release information in tantalizing droplets getting moviegoers hooked on the mystery he cultivates. But does this strategy always benefit the films themselves? Conceived and shot in near-total secrecy like a surprise album dropped with little advance notice 10 Cloverfield Lane follows in the clawed footprints of another project produced but not directed by Abrams the 2008 mock-doc monster movie Cloverfield. And yet those primed to watch more camera-toting hipsters run for their lives across Manhattan a skyscraper-sized lizard in hot pursuit should know that a title is close to all that the new film shares with the old one. On top of that this ""spiritual sequel"" seems almost perversely at odds with the expectations it inflates What comes packaged as a major motion-picture event quickly reveals itself to be something more modest--a pressurized chamber thriller not an early prelude to the clang-and-bang summer season.Cloverfield toyed with scope The film either blew up found-footage horror to city-destroying proportions or squeezed a kaiju movie into the viewfinder of a digital camcorder. The rescaling this time has more to do with franchise logic than genre. How many sequels spiritual or otherwise go smaller than the original? 10 Cloverfield Lane does relocating the conflict from a demolished metropolis to a rural bunker. Here 40 miles from Lake Charles and some distance below a farmhouse Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) awakens from a nasty car crash to find herself shackled to a bed the unwilling guest of the man who pulled her from the wreckage. Howard (John Goodman) insists that the world above is now a radioactive crater; some one or some thing has made the surface inhospitable meaning that Michelle will have to rough it in close quarters with Howard and a third party nice-guy beardo Emmett (The Newsrooms John Gallagher Jr.) who not only isnt a prisoner but actually fought his way down there.Almost all of 10 Cloverfield Lane takes place in this single location a cozy underground domicile whose stacks of old board games and working old-timey jukebox cant quite chase away the sense of captivity. At first Michelle thinks of nothing but escape. But soon she begins to wonder if her savior/captors paranoid theories arent so paranoid after all. Is Howard who craves gratitude for allowing others into his doomsday shelter a madman or a prophet? Is the chemical/biological/nuclear threat real or is all in the head of this humorless military veteran? The high-tension drama pivots around this frightening question mark of motivation and its hard to imagine it operating without Goodman who splits the difference between workingman weariness and hulking menace better than he has since Barton Fink. (Even in his 60s the actor remains an intimidating physical presence capable of chilling bloodstreams without raising his voice--though few bellow as convincingly.) Goodman keeps us (and the characters) guessing throughout with a vital assist from Whiplash mastermind Damien Chazelle who co-wrote the screenplay with Josh Campbell and Matthew Stuecken and who knows a thing or two about building suspense from the motives of a hard-ass authority figure.That none of this unfolds from the perspective of a subjective camera is a relief even if Cloverfield remains one of the more inventive entries in the ongoing found-footage cycle. First-time director Dan Trachtenberg--an Abrams protege just like the originals Matt Reeves--shoots 10 Cloverfield Lane mostly in claustrophobic close-up a suitable strategy for studying the shifting allegiances of his surrogate subterranean family. Setting aside a few stylistic flairs--the opening credits arrive during the auto accident creating alarming shock cuts to darkness and silence every few seconds--Trachtenberg mostly just trusts his capable cast and the sturdy three-hander cooked up for them. (He also leans heavily on Walking Dead composer Bear McCreary whose urgent suspense score makes this deliberately small movie feel a little bigger giving it an extra charge of Spielbergian grandeur.)The film works so well as a kind of extra-long Twilight Zone episode that its kind of disappointing when the scale does increase during the perhaps inevitable big bang of a climax. Which is to say carefully and vaguely that the worse thing about 10 Cloverfield Lane is that it turns out to be a Cloverfield movie. Abrams deserves some credit for taking an unusual approach to franchise building attempting what John Carpenter tried and failed to do with Halloween--namely construct an anthology series around a successful brand name. But unfair as it may seem to judge a book through the context of its cover its hard to shake the feeling that the movies final moves are an extension of its brilliantly cryptic marketing campaign--in other words 10 Cloverfield Lane might develop in a more interesting direction if it wasnt forced to play off the expectations Abrams engineered for it. Theres a fine nerve-jangling little psychological thriller here. Pity it couldnt have been allowed to just be that.For thoughts on and a place to discuss plot details we cant reveal in this review visit 10 Cloverfield Lanes spoiler space.

Powered by WordPress.com VIP Sponsored Content Entertainment Bill Zwecker 03/10/2016 0700am 10 Cloverfield Lane Tense and twisty beneath the surface John Goodman and Mary Elizabeth Winstead in ""10 Cloverfield Lane."" | Michele K. Short/Paramount Pictures Bill Zwecker billzwecker | email While producer J.J. Abrams describes ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" as being very different but in ""the same wheelhouse"" as the 2008 film ""Cloverfield"" it still needs to be stressed that this intense continually gripping and extremely engrossing movie is not a sequel to the equally excellent earlier film also produced by Abrams. While the original ""Cloverfield"" took place in the urban panorama of New York City ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" keeps us locked -- much like the three main characters -- in a bunker located beneath a very remote farmhouse in rural America. The horror we find here is intimate in-your-face and frankly quite claustrophobic driven by John Goodman in one of his scariest performances to date -- and that is intended to be the highest of compliments. The setup is fairly simple. After Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is involved in a severe auto crash on a lonely country highway she wakes up tightly tethered to a mattress on the floor of a subterranean concrete bunker shackled to the wall. Her captor Goodmans Howard claims he saved Michelles life following her accident -- and if he hadnt she would be dead like everyone else outside. One of the things I truly loved about this movie was the way the writers -- Josh Campbell Matt Stuecken and Damien Chazelle -- oozed out the details on every level. That includes that supposed external threat beyond the bunker Howards own backstory and other factors regarding this deliciously twisted tale. Big kudos too go to first-time feature director Dan Trachtenberg who has helmed this film with artistry imagination and skillful precision. This is a terrific movie that will keep audiences gripping their seats from start to finish and a great deal of that is due to the magnificent acting jobs by Goodman Winstead and co-star John Gallagher Jr. who plays the third resident of the bunker. We learn Gallaghers Emmitt was Howards helper in building the basement shelter -- but not whether his presence is voluntary or not. Clearly Michelle is not in the bunker by choice -- at least not initially -- and Winsteads interpretation of the character is a marvel to behold. Michelle is bright feisty and always on the alert to find a way to escape at least in the early stages of her captivity. Its a delight to watch her move from terror and fear of the unknown to moments of warmth playfulness and even glee. Gallagher too deserves commendation for giving us an Emmitt who clearly isnt the sharpest knife in the drawer but is perhaps more cunning than his external country-hick persona would lead us to believe. However the power of ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" lies mainly with Goodman. He controls every scene and he does it in such a mercurial way. One moment hes the epitome of towering rage. The next he can be cajoling and flirtatious. The actors ability to turn moods on a mere twitch of his eyes or curl of his lip is one of the factors that makes this movie so downright compelling and scary as hell Unpredictability in cinema is frequently a missing element -- especially when were talking about movies that fall into the horror or science-fiction genres. With ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" there is no such problem. Trust me. There are many twists and turns presented here that you simply wont see coming. And that is a very good thing.  Paramount Pictures presents a film directed by Dan Trachtenberg and written by Josh Campbell Matt Stuecken and Damien Chazelle. Running time 106 minutes. Rated PG-13 (for thematic material including frightening sequences of threat with some violence and brief language). Opens Friday at local theaters.

Made in PR silence under a code name dropped on the public without advance warning it arrives with no whispers no hype and absolutely no fanfare. Surprise J.J. Abrams strikes again in his hobby roles as producer and showrunner using the same kind of stealth strategy that launched ""Cloverfield"" his clever 2008 war of the worlds fantasy. Now that creature feature has become the cornerstone of a new cinematic universe. Or maybe possibly its sly name dropping being used to lure us into an unrelated story. Or ... Im not telling. The point of this precisely crafted film is psychological possibility. It creates a kind of Hitchcockian thriller where uncertainty soaks the story and spreads across the atmosphere like blood on a shirt. Even in the opening our main character is already nervous and wrung out. The crisis isnt mass disaster. Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead a rising star approaching the pinnacle) is having a traumatic breakup with her man (whose phone voice Bradley Cooper shows how effective he can be through spoken lines alone). Something emotionally brutal is happening. She races out of her apartment leaving behind a diamond ring and a set of keys. Then shes drawn into a much harder battle tightening our anxiety for her like a noose. Those abandoned keys become the metaphorical point of the story as she jolts awake locked in a basement bunker. The scale of the place is chilling. In his feature debut director Dan Trachtenberg ratchets up the claustrophobia with blistering virtuosity. Were quickly introduced to the films triangle of characters. The commanding officer of the survivalist shelter is Howard (John Goodman who never fails to please). The portly military vet tells Michelle he has rescued her from a cataclysmic attack and will not release her from his underground Noahs Ark until hes sure that its safe. Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) a voluble young dude radiates a bit of tonal comedy advising her to be thankful because Howard was probably right about predicting this doomsday 9/11 times infinity. Probably. So with these threats of external terrorism and homemade authoritarianism has Michelle been rescued or kidnapped? The question becomes more combustible scene by scene as the film works her over handling us the same way. Much of ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is an ingenious game of Who Do You Trust? Emmett feels a bit too nice and needy with his broken arm in a sling. Theres a prison guard air around control freak Howard and his holstered revolver. Michelle has no halo herself hitting both ends of the fight or flight response in ways that can trigger harmful events of her own creation. 10 Cloverfield Lane  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for thematic material including frightening sequences of threat with some violence and brief language. Furniture is hurled and rants are spit in a shrewd contrast to the shelters mood lighting and Home Sweet Home decor. Nothing set in a confined windowless space should be this distressing and nerve-racking. The sounds of quakes distant aircraft and failing air filters suggest that bad things are warming up on the runway things undefined in sustained ways that trigger paranoia on screen and in the theater. The films 11th-hour twists hit the story with a jarring bump bringing a movie that is smart and inspired down a notch. Until that point we are wondering whether death and destruction are Howards external threats or internal impulses. Or both. Im not telling.

Short AP 10 Cloverfield Lane is an irresistible thriller 1 / 2 Back to Gallery ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is an irresistible thriller directed with lots of confidence and flair. Director Dan Trachtenberg announces his presence from the first moments and almost as soon as that the audience knows its in good hands. Though the movie takes place almost entirely in a single location it is constantly active and tense. The opening scene is like a silent movie. With Bear McCrearys ostentatious menacing music soaring over the soundtrack -- this is music that wants you to notice it -- we see a young woman making a phone call (we dont hear her voice) packing a bag and leaving her engagement ring and keys behind her. This is Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and she is beginning a new life. The silent sequence which continues as she drives away in her car has an interesting effect. Often with thrillers as with horror movies the openings grab us so that by the time the genre kicks in and starts delivering thrills all that thriller stuff feels like an intrusion. But by making the whole opening without dialogue the director sets the movies first minutes aside as something apart. We feel instinctively that this is not the real story. From here ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" wastes no time getting started. By the opening credits were intrigued and when the credits end and we find our heroine chained up and living in a concrete bunker -- well were just appalled and enlisted for the duration. John Goodman plays her host-jailer Howard who is an odd case. Hes at least a little bit evil and hes definitely slightly off his rocker. The only question is whether hes very crazy and downright diabolical. If you see this film youll spend much of it trying to decide about Howard and making decisions and then revising them. Michelle has company in the bunker Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) who helped Howard build the underground hideaway and from just those elements -- three characters living under the ground -- the filmmakers spin a gripping 105 minutes. The script is full of surprises and Trachtenberg and the actors make a good screenplay even better which is how things are supposed to work. To this point in her career Mary Elizabeth Winstead has been bobbing into and out of the radar always distinctive always better than the material and always on the verge of becoming famous. (There was some Oscar buzz a few years back for her portrayal of an alcoholic in ""Smashed."") Perhaps she will break through with ""10 Cloverfield Lane."" Much of what she does in the film is wordless -- clocking Howards every utterance gauging his lunacy showing flickers of disappointment when she realizes Emmett is too dim to be much help -- and shes terrific. So is Goodman who is menacing and yet somehow amusing in places too. He has the kind of command of himself and the audience that one usually associates with stage actors. Throughout he handles himself with precision and part of the pleasure of ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is looking back on his performance once you know what was going on in Howards mind. It was all there. Ultimately ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" may consist of empty calories but its a full meal all the same. At one point this movie had me so on edge that I had a fleeting impulse to run out of the theater. It might be weird to say that and mean it as a compliment but good thrillers work that way sometimes. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Abrams Movie Review 10 Cloverfield Lane is monster-sized surprise Review BY Ethan Sacks NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday March 10 2016 1121 AM facebook Tweet email BY Ethan Sacks NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday March 10 2016 1121 AM Title 10 Cloverfield Lane Film Info A survivalist holds two guests captive in his underground bunker claiming a mysterious large-scale attack has rendered the air outside toxic. Directed by Dan Trachtenberg. With Mary Elizabeth Winstead John Goodman and John Gallagher Jr. Rating PG-13 (145). Opens March 11 in area theaters. Going into ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" knowing virtually nothing about what awaits is the nature of the beast for a J.J. Abrams-produced movie. Abrams Bad Robot even managed to hide the very existence of the follow-up to the 2008 cult monster movie ""Cloverfield"" until the trailer hit the Internet just six weeks before the rest of the flick hits theaters. But the real-Godzilla sized surprise is that rookie director Dan Tractenberg has crafted a taut compact thriller that could have stood on its own without the third acts extraneous supernatural MacGuffin. HOW FILMMAKERS HID 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE IN PLAIN SITE Something Wicked This Way Comes John Goodman as Howard; Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Michelle; and John Gallagher Jr. as Kyle in ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" (Paramount Pictures) Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays a woman who wakes up from a car accident in a locked underground bunker as a captive of an increasingly unhinged survivalist (John Goodman) who is aptly described as ""a blackbelt in conspiracy theory"" by a third inhabitant of the lair (Tony-winner John Gallagher Jr.) Dont worry about the glimpses of Winsteads Michelle in her underwear from the trailer This isnt a sequel to ""Room."" A problem solver with a MacGuyver-like streak the doe-eyed actress has landed one of the best-written heroines in a horror film in years. Every instinct is propelling Winsteads Michelle to make an escape but shes told that the air outside has been rendered noxious by a large-scale chemical or nuclear attack carried out by the Russians...or Martians...or North or South Koreans. Winsteads Michelle is one of the best written genre film heroines in years. (Paramount Pictures) Punctuating the dread are mysterious noises from a large presence above the bunker -- one that sounds uncomfortably like the much derided Smoke Monster from ""Lost"" which Abrams co-created. (Spoiler alert its not) Tractenberg evidently a fan of lingering close-ups lets the audience marinate in a claustrophobic vibe. The truth is this ""blood relative"" to ""Cloverfield"" as Abrams has called it is much better than the over-rated original -- with that movies jerky found-footage gimmick and population filled with annoying characters who couldnt be eaten fast enough. The best reveal of ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is that the script from Josh Campbell Matthew Steucken and Damien Chazelle (""Whiplash"") is strong enough to have made a compelling stageplay instead of a creature feature.

The cozy warren where Mary Elizabeth Winstead awakens her leg shackled and an IV poking into her arm looks like a luxury Airbnb. Theres a kitchen a living room a jukebox a TV and a library of DVDs and VHS tapes - and she has her own private place to sleep. Sure the door is locked from the outside. But things could be worse. More about 10 Cloverfield Lane >> Or could they? In 10 Cloverfield Lane a wickedly clever nightmare entertainment and a spiritual successor to 2008s J.J. Abrams-overseen found-footage sci-fier Cloverfield Winstead is Michelle a New Orleans millennial who begins the movie breaking up (by iPhone) with her boyfriend packs her stuff gets in her car and leaves town. Later that night shes run off a dark road with her car rolling ominously into a gully. When she regains consciousness shes the prisoner in some creepy guys place. ""Im sorry but no one is looking for you"" Michelles burly host tells her when she warns him that people will be wondering wheres she gone. His name is Howard. Hes ex-Navy. Hes played by John Goodman furtive soft-spoken funny here and there and absolutely menacing everywhere. If theres a moment when he calls out ominously that reminds you of Jack Nicholson in The Shining I dont think thats an accident. But before that when Howard is acting calm and full of concern and candor he tells Michelle that he didnt abduct her he rescued her. Some kind of holocaust has happened nuclear war invaders from Mars whatever it is theres no one left above ground. He built this survivalists lair for just such an occasion. Dan Trachtenberg a Philadelphia native and Temple film school alum making a crafty confident feature debut takes things from there. It turns out Howard has another houseguest Emmett (Short Term 12s John Gallagher Jr.) a local boy who helped build the bunker and who now sleeps in a nook surrounded by canned provisions. Emmetts arm is in a sling hes bruised and bloodied but he seems in good spirits considering. He takes a shine to Michelle. To say any more about what goes on in 10 Cloverfield Lane is to say too much. The audience is left (and led) to wonder whether Howard could possibly be speaking the truth. Winstead who demonstrated her formidable talents in the 2012 indie Smashed (shes a schoolteacher shes a drunk - see it) is riveting as the victim here. No not the victim - you can see the resolve the resourcefulness in her eyes. Shes going to do her damnedest to get out of here or die trying. So whats the connection to Cloverfield? Is there a connection or is this just some kind of J.J. Abrams/Bad Robot (his production company) joke? By the end of the thumpingly exhilarating 10 Cloverfield Lane that will all become really clear.

Something has happened above ground but what?John Goodman as Howard; Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Michelle in ""10 Cloverfield Lane.""(Photo Paramount Pictures)Story HighlightsGoodman is never better than when playing a nut which may or may not be what he is doing hereCritics rating 3 stars out of 5Imagine if ""Room"" or ""The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt"" had been made by a 9-year-old boy.Thats sort of what ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is like a kid playing with one thing until all of a sudden chucking that and playing with another.Director Dan Trachtenbergs film produced by J.J. Abrams arrives under a cloak of insisted-upon secrecy by the filmmakers and you wont see their request ignored here. The films surprises -- and the answers to the questions it asks -- are better discovered on your own even if most people have some idea of what might happen. But it will help explain some dancing around the story.Not exactly a sequel to ""Cloverfield"" the 2008 film Abrams also produced ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" would seem to take place around the same time. Something is going on in the world -- an abbreviated radio report talks about electrical surges -- but Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) has other problems. Shes leaving her boyfriend packing up and heading out on the road.We gather from a phone call from her boyfriend (an unseen Bradley Cooper) that there was some sort of argument; shes accused of always running from her problems.RELATED So how did Bradley Cooper end up in 10 Cloverfield Lane?Shes running now until a car accident. Now we tread lightly and if you are opposed to knowing anything more about the film well I hear the crosswords are pretty interesting.Lets say this Michelle ends up living in an underground bunker with Howard Stambler (John Goodman) a bear of a man who says something horrible has happened above ground. Hes not sure what but he thinks an attack of some kind -- maybe even alien. Michelle will have to live down here for a year or two until things settle down up top.As you might imagine this is not exactly news she wants to hear. There is some relief in a somewhat normal neighbor Emmet (John Gallagher Jr.) who is buying what Howard is selling. Michelle is not so sure.John Goodman as Howard Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Michelle and John Gallagher Jr. as Emmett in ""10 Cloverfield Lane."" (Photo Paramount Pictures)Howard is nothing if not prepared for the situation; he has spent much of the last few years getting ready. But there are hints in his controlling nature and occasional odd statements that remind Michelle and eventually Emmet that a survivalist may not be who you want to spend the next couple of years of your life in close proximity with.What are the alternatives? Well thats the film right? Is there danger and certain death on the outside as Howard insists? Or is Howard the true danger? Michelle simply doesnt have a lot of options. The unorthodox family makes peace for a while but its impossible for so many doubts to simmer for so long without them boiling over. And then? Then we stop our discussion of the story and talk about Trachtenbergs ratcheting of tension of putting us in the same claustrophobic world Michelle finds herself in. When a game of Monopoly with a possible psycho starts to look like a welcome form of entertainment you know you are in a bad place.RELATEDJ.J. Abrams takes ride at the park with 10 Cloverfield LaneTrachtenberg is patient building this world and the actors do a good job inhabiting it. Winstead is a terrific actress and she makes Michelles desperation and inventiveness believable. Goodman is never better than when playing a nut and while we arent sure if thats what hes doing here the possibility makes for an intriguing portrayal.Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Michelle in ""10 Cloverfield Lane."" (Photo Paramount Pictures)So far so good. But there is a tonal shift in the film that is jarring -- not in itself a bad thing necessarily but it comes off less effective than it might. Then again there are reasons that ... never mind. Maybe it shows Trachtenbergs range. But it comes off more like the 9-year-old boy mentioned above.That spirit infuses by the way films like Abrams ""Star Wars The Force Awakens."" But so does a mastery of the form. Trachtenbergs film is intriguing where Abrams is that and so much more.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

But know this ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is terrific if you like smart constantly changing little thrillers. The film begins silently (over a great old-fashioned score by Bear McCreary) as Mary Elizabeth Winsteads Michelle bolts from her fiances apartment after an argument. Jittery confused she only wants to drive far far away. And she does. Until she gets into a horrific accident. When she wakes up the next morning shes in a basement bunker hooked up to an I.V. tended to by John Goodmans Howard. He pulled her from the wreck he says and took her here. Good thing too. Because right after he did the whole world was attacked. Howards not sure if was Martians or the Russkies. But Michelle shouldnt worry too much. Hes a survivalist from way back. Hes got plenty of canned food. They dont have to set a foot outside for years. And hell make sure they wont. The very clever thing about the minimalist ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is that it keeps you guessing. Does Howard have other plans for Michelle? Has he maybe even brought other women down there? Women hes kidnapped and killed? Or is he actually right? Is there something horrible happening in the world outside this windowless tomb? Is there even a world? The movie goes back and forth between the two possibilities even deepening them as it goes on with plausible evidence on either side. (If there wasnt an attack why is the radio dead? If there was what was Howard doing out on the highway at all?) MORE J.J. Abrams answers (some of) your questions And it gives us a great resourceful heroine in Michelle who is determined to get out of this prison - no matter whats out there. The film earns its suspense honestly. After a literally slam-bang opening things progress quietly carefully helped along by perfect performances. Winstead has always been an immediately sympathetic actress Goodman one who can use his bulk as a weapon or a shield. She quickly wins our loyalty; he keeps us off-guard. The craft that went into this film is evident. Novice director Dan Trachtenberg made this his first feature under producer J.J. Abrams watchful eye and everything has been thought through. Howards bunker is full of believable detail its layout immediately logical and clear; the editing is precise and economical. The script (punched up by Damien Chazelle of ""Whiplash"") quietly explores the dysfunctional roles Howard and Michelle quickly fall into. And unlike other films which sometimes mistake ambiguity for confusion ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" plays fair with its audience neither telling us more than we need to know nor leaving us with any questions we truly need to have answered. Oh and a word about the title which encouraged people to dub this as a direct follow-up to ""Cloverfield"" the nauseatingly shaky-cam 2008 movie from Abrams and company about a Godzilla-like creature rampaging through Manhattan. Its not that. But I sure hope theres an ""11 Cloverfield Lane."" Ratings note The film contains strong language and violence. 10 Cloverfield Lane (PG-13) Paramount (105 min.)

Abrams calls ""a blood relative"" of the 2008 found-footage monster movie. (Paramount Pictures/Bad Robot) Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Goodman in 10 Cloverfield Lane.(Photo Michele K. Short)Sorry Scooby-Doo nobody heads up a Mystery Machine anymore like J.J. Abrams.The producers signature stamp and influence permeate the thriller 10 Cloverfield Lane ( out of four; rated PG-13; in theaters Friday nationwide) a well-crafted affair by debuting director Dan Trachtenberg that mixes elements of an intimate stage play with the white-knuckled tension of a cracking good Twilight Zone episode.Its not quite a sequel to 2008s Abrams-produced Cloverfield. And thats the best thing about it Lane shares some connective and thematic tissue with the found-footage monster mash while also existing as both a Hitchcockian drama and an unlikely heros journey.Something is amiss from the very start with Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) packing her bags and heading down the Louisiana highway to somewhere anywhere in a fantastic wordless opening set to Bear McCrearys roiling glorious score. One frightening car wreck later -- for her and the audience -- and Michelle wakes up in the underground bunker of very odd doomsday prepper Howard (John Goodman).USA TODAYJust whats going on at 10 Cloverfield Lane?You get to know just enough about those two and their other enigmatic new housemate Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) as Howard insists they dont go above ground because as he says ""theres been an attack."" Is it Russians? Martians? North Korea? No one knows but its not safe outside and insides a bit iffy as well as a serious and often darkly comic situation develops between the threesome.The middle of the movie borders on Lifetime-level drama theatrics though Trachtenberg nails enough scenes to keep an appropriate tautness as the film moves into its revelatory third act the definite highlight of Lane. Its not fair to ruin the payoff here but its exceedingly well-played consistent with the rest of the film and offers some surprise. (For those who absolutely positively need a hint pay attention to the songs that play on the bunkers jukebox.)USA TODAY10 Cloverfield Lane rocks a survival-chic bunkerProving again that hes undoubtedly one of the best character actors working Goodman shines as Howard an impossible-to-read lug of a guy with a burly intimidating stature but also a sad sense of loneliness. Winstead is just as good carrying the movies emotional burden on her shoulders much of the time.Just like other Abrams films where the central secrecy tends to overpower everything else in an audiences eyes 10 Cloverfield Lane never tells the whole story and instead lets the viewer fill in their own blanks.And if the geek guru and his chosen filmmaking collaborators go forward in keeping the Cloverfield name alive in such an insightful fashion -- as Black Mirror has done for the TV sci-fi anthology crowd -- then having the questions outnumber the answers is just the right formula.John Goodman as Howard Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Michelle and John Gallagher Jr. as Emmett in the motion picture 10 Cloverfield Lane.

"Waiting out the apocalypse in 10 Cloverfield Lane (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Waiting out the apocalypse in 10 Cloverfield Lane (PG-13) A tense thriller about three strangers locked inside an underground bomb shelter with connections to 2008s Cloverfield. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com3/10/2016 Editor rating 2.5 The best way to approach 10 Cloverfield Lane is to put all that Cloverfield business out of your mind and enjoy the movie for what it is a taut expertly calibrated thriller set almost entirely within cramped quarters about three strangers trying to figure out if they can trust each other. The central protagonist is Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) a fashion designer who wakes up after a car accident chained to a cot in some sort of underground chamber. Howard (John Goodman) an anxious worrisome man who brings her food on a tray as if she were a prisoner tells her theres been some kind of attack -- a ""big one"" -- and that everyone she knows is dead and the planet is either contaminated or poisoned by radiation and they will have to wait a year or two before its safe to go outside. Who is responsible? Maybe the Russians or maybe Martians Howard speculates. ""You think I sound crazy"" he tells Michelle after noticing how shes looking at him. But theres another man living in the shelter Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) who doesnt seem weird or troubled in any way and who confirms Howards story. He tells Michelle he saw the attack -- a big flash of red that consumed everything like something you read about in the Bible -- and he seems resigned to make the best of the situation and wait things out. What other choice is there? First-time director Dan Trachtenberg who landed the 10 Cloverfield Lane gig on the strength of several TV commercials and the short film Portal No Escape that went viral in 2011 doesnt string you along Within the first half-hour Michelle confirms something horrible has indeed happened to the world and leaving the bunker to go outside would mean a ghastly death. Besides Howard has stocked his bomb shelter with plenty of food and movies and books and board games and theres  enough food to wait out the apocalypse. He even installed a shower curtain in the bathroom. Hes a thoughtful generous guy. But something about him seems ... off. Goodman has played likable teddy bears and sinister cretins throughout his career. But hes rarely had the opportunity to play a character that is both of those things at once. Howard is a cross between Dan from TVs Roseanne and the salesman who oozed pus from his ears in Barton Fink. Goodmans performance is so effective -- you keep changing your mind about him -- that 10 Cloverfield Lane builds up a creepy aura of menace even though nothing seems to be happening. A scene in which the trio sits down for a dinner that goes from pleasant to psycho in a matter of seconds is a highlight. Eventually the movie begins to turn the screws and Winstead who entranced Michael Cera in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World and fought off shape-shifting extraterrestrials in the 2011 remake of The Thing is forced to take drastic action. Yes Im being intentionally vague here because a big part of the films tension comes from not knowing what exactly Michelles dilemma actually is. Unlike 2008s Cloverfield which was sold from the start as a found-footage movie about a giant monster attacking New York City 10 Cloverfield Lane is being marketed as something more mysterious -- its a sibling of that previous film but definitely not a sequel. That turns out to be true but the curiosity created by the ingenious trailers could backfire leaving audiences asking ""Is that it?"" 10 Cloverfield Lane which was reworked from a script originally titled The Cellar is dark nasty fun that gets better when you play it over in your head. But the plot holes seem even larger in hindsight too. Just tamp down those expectations then tamp them down some more.

Credit Paramount/Getty Images 3.5 stars (out of 4)Check your nerves at the theater door. Take a deep breath while you still can. And then calmly apologize in advance to the person sitting next to you for jumping out of your seat and clutching a stray hand for dear life.There. Now youre ready to partake in some terrifying fun. Producer J.J. Abrams is trumpeting his latest Bad Robot project as a sort-of sibling to 2008s creepy found-footage hit Cloverfield. But this pic is more of a blood relative to the claustrophobic thrills and dark humor of the 1990 classic Misery. And no you dont have to be familiar with the mothership movie to fully understand -- and appreciate -- this sharp and tightly wound winner. Celebs Horror Movie Pasts The scares start before a single line of dialogue is uttered. With ominous music taunting us in the background we see a twenty-something girl (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) flitting around in an empty apartment. She walks out in a huff leaving a diamond ring on a table. While driving on a desolate highway her boyfriend Ben calls her on the iPhone and pleads forgiveness. (Check the closing credits to ID the A-lister who supplies Bens voice). And then ... boom. This was a highly clandestine production for a reason Part of the beauty of the film is that you dont know what the heck is going on and you dont want to know. So plot details shall be kept to a minimum. These are just the necessary basics  -- The girl is named Michelle. She wakes up and finds herself handcuffed to a bed in a cellar which is part of a large tricked-out underground bunker. It looks strikingly similar to Desmonds hatch in Lost. (Hey lets pretend that Abrams a Lost cocreator is giving a subtle wink to all the shows fans). Anyway Michelle wants out. -- Her gruff caretaker Howard (John Goodman) is a self-professed survivalist. He explains to Michelle that she cant leave because the country is ""under attack"" and the air is polluted. She needs to stay in the enclosed space for one year. Minimum. -- Another person a good-natured dude named Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) is also staying on the premises. He claims he is there of his own free will. John Goodman as Howard; Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Michelle; and John Gallagher Jr. as Emmett in 10 Cloverfield Lane. Paramount As the suspense heightens the dynamic between the three characters in these ultraconfining surroundings constantly changes. At any given moment Howard could either be a trustworthy father figure or a deeply disturbed kook. He adores his 60s ditties on the jukebox which is endearing. He has a thing for Pretty in Pink too. Duckie Blane How sinister can he be? Then again he also has a shotgun and a short-fused temper. Never mind. Hes a lunatic. Right? Horror Movie Stars Then and Now What an inspired choice to cast Goodman as the man in charge. Though not a traditional leading man the underrated actor has crafted a career by playing a relatable everyman. He has been a good guy (Roseanne Argo) a loveable goof (The Flinstones) a bully (Revenge of the Nerds) and honed his comic skills hosting Saturday Night Live roughly 33 times. Theres a comfort in seeing him on screen even when hes biting off the ear of a goon in The Big Lebowski. We want to believe hes being honest with Michelle when he laments the loss of his daughter. But only a fool would underestimate him. And Winstead -- in a breakthrough performance -- does not play scrappy quick-thinking Michelle as a fool. (Winsteads mental strength is a key cog in the triangle. Nobody wants to root for an idiotic damsel-in-distress). It bears repeating Dont try to outguess the narrative. And for the love of Google dont scour the web for third-act spoilers. Just exult in knowing that an old-fashioned scary movie can still make you squirm laugh and gasp for air.

Paramount Pictures A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - In one key way the kinda-maybe sequel 10 Cloverfield Lane might be the purest example yet of the J.J. Abrams house style. Directed by first-timer Dan Trachtenberg but produced by Abrams (Super 8 Lost Alias Cloverfield etc.) the thriller is yet another of the fannish wunderbrands mystery boxes a genre tease whose marketing makes a secret not just of its twists but of its very premise. The innovation this time? Now the characters are actually inside the mystery box itself either by proud choice (John Goodmans whiskery survivalist) desperate fear (John Gallagher Jr.s even more whiskery builder bro) or terrifying mysterious happenstance (Mary Elizabeth Winstead).Thats no spoiler. Some three minutes in after opening titles that give jarring new meaning to the term ""smash cut"" Winsteads Michelle awakens in a cinderblock cell cuffed to a cot and bleeding from a head wound. But we immediately glean how resourceful she is as shes wearing the official uniform of intrepid young women in genre movies everywhere a tight white tank top.Film Details 10 Cloverfield Lane RatingPG-13 GenreSciFi/Fantasy Running Time106 min. More Info Trailer We also can tell because Winstead is adept at puzzling things out as we watch letting us see her eyes take in each clue around her and suggesting with quick glances or a hitch of her swooping eyebrows that shes resolved to take resourceful action. Seeing what she does next -- with a lighter shes lucked upon or a crutch shes whittled into a shiv -- is one of the films true thrills.Even when Michelle is playing nice for her captor Winsteads eyes are alert even calculating and Trachtenberg usually lets us know everything that she does. That makes 10 Cloverfield Lane engaging in a way Hollywood events usually arent It invites us to work out what her next move should be. Its like one of those locked-room team-building games where you have to figure out how to escape with the couple of items youve been given except with John Goodman insisting that no actually you dont want to get out -- that this is a survival bunker and theres been an attack of some sort terrorist or alien or Cloverfield and the air outside will kill you. Michelles glimpses of the farmland surrounding the shelter arent encouraging and Goodmans Howard a stern and prideful rule-maker keeps insisting that she should be grateful he bothered to save her. (Also that she should use coasters and re-sleeve any DVDs she watches.)All that setup gets paid off generously and in spectacular fashion. This is no tease like that time when the Lost gang found a secret bunker but then didnt actually open it until the next season. Ill say nothing of the films revelations but for this The brash madness of it all is as the multiplexes demand ""fun"" but its kids stuff compared to the tough tense scenes of Michelle plotting behind her mask of a face as her captor/savior prattles on about his own preparedness for the tragedy he claims has wiped out the rest of humanity. Such scenes play out around a cozy dinner table or in an underground living room tricked out with a ""Home Sweet Home"" cross-stitch. That perverse domesticity must be the inspiration behind the boldly ludicrous title Whats next I Married Cloverfield? (The film was originally titled Valencia and had nothing to do with Cloverfield until deep into production.)As a gamelike simulationist PG-13 horror chamber piece 10 Cloverfield Lane is a success well shot and -staged arrestingly acted edited with a crisp unpredictability. Its less compelling in terms of character and meaning. Theres bite in Goodmans portrayal of an American classic the troubled dude so thoroughly prepped for doomsday that hes clearly rooting for doomsday to come. But the character suffers from mystery-box plotting To ensure were always guessing he cant just come out and tell Michelle in the early scenes what exactly is supposed to be going on. Hes so slow to spill the basics of the scenario that you might think the marketing team has them under embargo even inside the movie itself.10 Cloverfield Lane Directed by Dan Trachtenberg Paramount Pictures Opens March 11 Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Alan Scherstuhl Follow studiesincrap Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film and TV Film Reviews Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Whos in there whether or not they should be and whats really happening outside are questions that make up almost all of the plot and for most of the movies 105 minutes those mysteries are enough to generate tension and suspense amidst the claustrophobia. Even if this tale might have been better served as a 40-minute short than as a full-length movie first-time feature director Dan Trachtenberg has cast a trio of actors at the top of their game and they elevate the material. Its not easy to engender audience empathy while at the same time keeping viewers guessing as to a characters true motivations but these performers skillfully multi-task the script by newcomers Josh Campbell and Matthew Stuecken which got a rewrite by Damien Chazelle (""Whiplash""). Also Read Cloverfield Sequel Fans Go Nuts After Surprise Trailer Drops Aspiring fashion designer Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"") tearfully packs up and walks out on a relationship but after her car goes off the road - in an accident thats jarringly captured under the opening credits - she wakes up in a knee brace thats chained to the wall of a cinder-block bunker. Howard (John Goodman) appears and informs her that there has been a devastating attack outside which has rendered the air unbreathable and that he has saved her life by bringing her to his shelter. Immediately were presented with a host of questions Is Howard telling the truth about the apocalypse outside? Is he merely a kidnapper of young women? And if so why is construction worker Emmitt (John Gallagher Jr. ""The Newsroom"") down there as well? Can Michelle trust Emmitt as an ally? The biggest mystery of all is of course what the heck does any of this have to do with 2008s ""Cloverfield"" which was also produced by J.J. Abrams? Also Read JJ Abrams to Casting Agents Send Me More Women and Minorities The pleasures of ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" come mostly from the eventual revelation of these questions so none of them will be answered here. What keeps the story so involving however is that every time Michelle thinks she has Howard or the situation itself figured out the script throws a curveball that suggests the opposite might also be true. Production designer Ramsey Avery and set decorators Michelle Marchand II and Kellie Jo Tinney accurately nail the look of a bomb shelter thats been furnished by a Louisiana Wal-Mart; everything from the light fixtures to the shower curtain have a cutesiness that Howard would find comforting. Being trapped there is like riding out the end times in a suffocatingly charmless model home and the camerawork by Jeff Cutter only accentuates the close quarters. ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" ultimately succeeds on the backs of its three performers all of whom work overtime to add dimension to fairly simple outlines. Winsteads eyes reveal that shes always looking for an out and thinking about what move to make next while Gallagher brings unexpected poignance to a speech about the moment when he gave up on his future. Also Read J.J. Abrams Hints at Cloverfield Trilogy Goodman whos become the kind of character actor who generally gets two or three meaty scenes before disappearing from a movie revels in all hes given to do here. Is Howard a dangerous lunatic or a survivalist who just hit the powerball? Or is he too complicated for an either/or? Were constantly seeing new sides to Howard and much of that comes from Goodman playing the audience like a fisherman alternating between yanking our chain and giving us some slack. If this were a play its quite possible that the audience would be left guessing as to what really happened and why but the movie provides answers which wind up being less interesting than the mystery of it all. Viewers will remember the resolution sure but if they look back fondly on ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" it will be for the joy of not knowing. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

TWITTER 3/11/2016 John Goodman and Mary Elizabeth Winstead headline Dan Trachtenbergas tense sci-fi thriller which was produced by J.J. Abrams. Flying under the radar with the working title Valencia the latest feature from producer J.J. Abrams was only linked to his previous Cloverfield project when trailers first surfaced last month under the current title. Directed by first-timer Dan Trachtenberg 10 Cloverfield Lane is in Abrams words a ""spiritual successor"" to Matt Reeves unusually gripping 2008 monster movie rather than a literal sequel. Any disclaimers seem unlikely to assuage long-standing expectations for a follow-up especially since promos for the film clearly hint at something otherworldly overshadowing the narrative. Trachtenberg favors a slow build getting to the final reveal however and although some may miss the immediacy of a rampaging kaiju destroying everything in its path this is an entirely different breed of movie thats potentially even more effective for its shift in style and tone. Irrepressible fanboy anticipation aside Paramounts enticing viral marketing campaign and enthusiastic word of mouth could propel the release to a strong showing going into the spring break season. Assumptions founded on the catastrophic conclusion of Cloverfield are quickly discarded as Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) flees New Orleans and a nasty fight with her fiance (Bradley Cooper heard only in voiceover) that throws their entire marriage plan into question. Randomly driving westward in the direction of Lake Charles shes somewhere on a deserted highway when a violent collision with a passing pickup sends her car off the road knocking her unconscious. When she recovers she finds herself chained to a makeshift bed in an underground cinder-block bunker constructed by Howard (John Goodman) a bearded hard-core pistol-packing survivalist who claims to have rescued her from the car crash and saved her life. When Michelle insists on seeking professional medical care Howard refuses to let her leave saying the surrounding area is under attack. ""Nobody is looking for you"" he chides her estimating it could be a year or more before its safe to go aboveground. Unsure whether to believe that shes actually been ""rescued"" and uneasy about remaining in the well-equipped shelter indefinitely Michelle discovers that theres another resident as well. An acquaintance of Howards who helped him build the structure Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) says he sought refuge after the attack confirming Howards version of events and his speculation that the vast majority of residents throughout the region are already dead. Still determined to get away Michelle makes a bold bid for freedom only to pull up short at the bunker door where she gets a glimpse of the horror awaiting outside. Resigned to devising an alternative strategy she tries to make the best of the makeshift domestic situation with increasingly paranoid Howard assuming the role of savior and benefactor. A random coincidence inspires her to forge an allegiance with Emmett to prepare another escape bid even though what she may find on the surface could be even more calamitous than Howards sinister doomsday planning. Both narratively and stylistically Cloverfield and 10 Cloverfield Lane remain at a significant remove from one another. Making an impactful feature debut Trachtenberg eschews the well-worn found-footage technique in favor of a suspenseful style thats more consistent with the tense character dynamics of the first two-thirds of the movie perceptibly heightened by the claustrophobic underground setting. The final third shifts into high-adrenaline action mode with some thrilling set pieces as Michelle faces unexpected new threats making the paradoxical conclusion satisfying on multiple levels as it delivers on the thriller setup while introducing surprising new developments. A subplot involving the mysterious disappearance of Howards teen daughter adds a frisson of dread thats strategically leveraged to catalyze the characters conclusive confrontation. Essentially a three-hander the highly inventive screenplay -- originally titled The Cellar -- by newcomers Josh Campbell and Matthew Stuecken (revised by Damien Chazelle before he went on to direct Whiplash) is anchored by a transformative performance from Goodman. Hulking hostile and wildly unpredictable hes like a wounded bear defending his lair whos forced to accommodate a pair of destabilizing interlopers. On the receiving end of all that poorly restrained aggression Winstead estimably balances Michelles flight-or-fight reactions with an unanticipated resourcefulness and assertive depth of self-preservation thats a challenging match for Howards perverse manipulations. Emmett ends up inextricably caught between these two resolute opponents and Gallagher convincingly embodies his perilously shifting loyalties as the horrifying scope of Howards transgressions inevitably emerges. Director of photography Jeff Cutters intimate camerawork often relying on darkly expressive close-ups before expansively capitalizing on later plot developments ably establishes the films unsettling tone underpinned by Bear McCrearys brooding orchestral score.

Abrams managed to surprise the world with 10 Cloverfield Lane 10 Cloverfield Lane unleashes Super Bowl ad Before we get started lets get one thing straight. If youre the type of spoiler-averse moviegoer who has a tendency to write angry letters to the editor or hammer out irate CAPS LOCK comments below reviews do us both a favor and just stop reading now. Seriously. Im not really planning on spilling super-important plot points here or telegraphing any surprise third-act twists (if in fact there are surprise third-act twists). But lets just agree that if your potential enjoyment of 10 Cloverfield Lane rests on knowing as little as possible going in then click on over to some of the other fine stories on EW. Okay? Okay. Disclaimers like the one above are getting to be a bit of a habit with J.J. Abrams productions like Lost Star Trek Into Darkness Star Wars The Force Awakens and now this one. The man has constructed his cult around mystery. And he seems to get off on making us all complicit in his secrets. Not that I have a problem with that. Writing a spoiler-free review is simple enough (if a little limiting). Plus Im a believer that theres nothing more satisfying than walking into a movie theater knowing next-to-nothing about the film youre about to see and getting the rug pulled out from under you - assuming of course that its a decent enough rug warranting all the tap-dancing and obfuscation. Abrams latest film the quasi-/semi-/kinda-/not really-sequel to 2008s Cloverfield is a decent enough rug. But its not a great one. Its like a solid Twilight Zone episode or second-tier M. Night Shyamalan movie like Signs. Its lean and taut and tense and moves with Swiss-clock precision. Still its not as scary as you want it to be. Honestly the best thing about it may be its buzz-building top-secret tease of a marketing campaign. The movie opens with a young woman named Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) whos frantically packing and rushing out the door of her apartment. Whatever the reason she needs to leave and she needs to leave fast. She drives into the night gets into a terrible car accident and wakes up in what looks like a concrete cellar. Shes got an I.V. drip injected into her arm but this is definitely not a hospital. And oh yeah shes also chained to the wall. Shes someones prisoner. Before you can say Room II (or Saw VII) in walks John Goodman with a tray of food in his hands and a gun on his hip. He tells her that hes not her jailer but her savior. He pulled her out of the wreckage. He also explains that she cant leave because theres been some sort of terrorist chemical attack or nuclear Armageddon unleashed by the Russians or who knows maybe its a Martian invasion. Seriously stop reading here if you dont want to know more... What happens next doesnt have very much to do with Abrams and Matt Reeves stealthy found-footage monster mash from eight years ago. Abrams himself has cryptically referred to 10 Cloverfield Lane as merely a ""blood relative"" of 2008s Cloverfield and thankfully that doesnt include a similar first-person shaky cam M.O. But apart from a similar what-is-happening air of anxiety you have to squint to connect it to the Cloverfield universe apart from the fact that its arrived at the multiplex with next to no advance warning. (Then again there may be connecting threads that Im not willing to divulge...Abrams isnt the only one who can be a tease). For a lot of people though the Abrams signature the shared tone and the publicity machines veiled come-on may be enough to get them to fork over their ten bucks and roll the dice. But will they get their moneys worth? Directed by first-time feature filmmaker Dan Trachtenberg the film puts Goodmans twitchy Howard Winsteads skeptical Michelle and a third bunker dweller (John Gallagher Jr.s Emmet a young handyman neighbor of Howards) into a claustrophobic subterranean space waiting for a sign that all is clear back on the surface. But slowly Michelle and Emmet find holes in Howards story. For the record everything Ive just described takes place in the first-third of the movie. But I think it would be churlish to say any more not because the studio would prefer it that way but because the small handful of thrills in 10 Cloverfield Lane are of the jump-scare variety. They work best when you dont see them coming. The movie doesnt have anything deeper on its mind than shouting ""Boo"" But sometimes a well-timed ""Boo"" can be enough. After all its why they still make jack in the boxes. For a rookie director Trachtenberg appears to be a real craftsman even if what hes crafting doesnt add up to as much as you hope it will. Like Shyamalans Signs its 90 minutes of anticipation - ominous trap-setting that leads to a big pay-off that is well staged but also a little anticlimactic and hokey. In the end I wished there was a better payoff to warrant all the mystery.

Watching ""Cloverfield"" the 2008 found-footage disaster movie about an alien invader on the streets of New York it was hard to root for human characters who generally seemed bent on taking the stupidest course of action possible and recording their stupidity for future generations to witness. But boy do you root for Mary Elizabeth Winstead as the far-from-stupid young woman trapped in an underground bunker in ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" a sensationally effective semi-sequel that bears virtually no narrative or stylistic resemblance to its predecessor The camera holds steady this time locked in close quarters with a monster who turns out to be all-too-pitiably human (played by a marvelously unnerving John Goodman). Which is not say there are no extraterrestrial terrors lurking in this taut three-character chamber piece -- think ""Room"" by way of ""War of the Worlds"" -- only that the tension is rooted in psychology rather than gimmickry and evinces a command of craft that feels old-fashioned in the most refreshing possible sense. Marking a rock-solid feature debut for director Dan Trachtenberg and screenwriters Josh Campbell and Matthew Stuecken (both credited for the story along with ""Whiplash"" writer-director Damien Chazelle) ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is the rare follow-up that wasnt even conceived with the first movie in mind. Developed for Paramounts now-defunct Insurge Pictures genre label under the working titles ""The Cellar"" and ""Valencia"" the film initially told a self-contained story before it was ingeniously reverse-engineered into an offshoot of the ""Cloverfield"" universe all done under the sort of secrecy weve come to expect from the imprimatur of J.J. Abrams. (Hes credited here as a producer while three collaborators from the first ""Cloverfield"" -- director Matt Reeves writer Drew Goddard and producer Bryan Burk -- are listed as executive producers.) Its a terribly clever marketing move that will likely maximize the commercial intake of a picture that cost less than 10 million to make (and whose conveniently number-forward title will ensure excellent placement in VOD queues). Still the studio may court some blowback from die-hard fans of the original film (which grossed 170 million worldwide on a 25 million budget) who may well reject Trachtenbergs movie as a cynical cash grab or take issue with the fact that it was shot on a tripod. Itd be easy enough to concur if not for the simple fact that ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is vastly smarter and more satisfying than its predecessor; every cynical cash grab should turn out this good. In an opening sequence that eerily echoes Marion Cranes flight from justice in ""Psycho"" an emotionally distraught Louisiana woman named Michelle (Winstead) packs her bags and drives out into the night. Along the way shes hectored by an angry boyfriend on the phone and also by Bear McCrearys frenzied score which rises to a pitch of shrieking intensity shortly before her car skids off the road and flips over. When Michelle regains consciousness she finds herself in a bunker several feet below ground where she is fed and tended to by her grizzled heavy-set man named Howard (Goodman). He urges her not to fight him or try to escape from the bunker which represents her only hope of survival. Shortly after the car accident Howard says some sort of mass chemical attack took place killing everyone and rendering the air unbreathable -- though not before he managed to rescue Michelle and bring her back to the bunker along with his genial young neighbor Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.). Sealed off from the outside world thanks to an airtight door and no cell-phone reception these three individuals -- possibly the last vestiges of humanity -- begin the long uneasy task of sweating out the apocalypse. Certainly there are worse places in which to do it The well-furnished bunker (outfitted with just the right ratio of cozy to musty by production designer Ramsey Avery) has electricity and running water; the shelves are lined with books games and movies; and theres enough food in the pantry to last them until the air clears. But comforts and utilities only go so far as Trachtenberg and his cinematographer Jeff Cutter -- whose camera navigates the space with effortless ease even when it has to squeeze inside an air shaft or down a garbage chute -- treat their solitary location as both a physical refuge and a psychological trap. The lengthy midsection of ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is a work of expertly modulated unease that alternates between claustrophobic suspense and doomsday panic; its the rare thriller in which the horror of what might be out there seems less threatening than the possibility that there may be no horror at all. For although there is persuasive even irrefutable evidence that a cataclysmic attack has indeed taken place the movie never allows us to forget the possibility that Howard might be a paranoid delusional psychopath -- someone who just happened to have a fully stocked shelter ready to go in case the world decided to end. That sense of menace stems less from the occasional contortions of the script than from Goodmans terrifying richly fleshed-out performance. A brilliant character actor who has been on a hot streak of late -- he was a memorable gargoyle in ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" and brought his boisterous comic gusto to bear on ""Argo"" ""The Gambler"" and ""Trumbo"" -- Goodman makes Howard a memorably complicated villain. Michelle and Emmett are indebted to the man for his resourcefulness and foresight and there are moments when Howard drops his guard to reveal a glimpse of a more reasonable even likable person beneath the clenched controlling surface. But those moments dont last and even Howards hospitality feels conditional tinged with spite entitlement and barely suppressed rage. The more Michelle comes to grasp the nature of his particular pathology the more she comprehends her need to escape even if it means confronting whatever might be waiting on the other side of the door. Winstead a seasoned scream queen and one of the most undervalued leading ladies around emphasizes the characters quicksilver intelligence and refusal to give up no matter how bad things get (which is often very very bad) and she gives the second half of ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" its thrilling momentum as Michelle takes matters into her own hands. Gallagher so good opposite Brie Larson in ""Short Term 12"" at once varies and complicates the dynamic between the two leads even if Emmetts role is necessarily the least developed of the three. Still the psychological grounding that Trachtenberg achieves here provide more-than-sufficient ballast for the harrowing final moments which send the movie in an appreciably wilder more unhinged direction; rarely has ""out of the frying pan and into the fire"" felt more apt as a description. It would be unfair to say more or to note exactly how ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" connects with ""Cloverfield"" -- a question that matters more from a branding perspective anyway than a dramatic one. By the end of this tense and unexpectedly human-scaled movie all that high-concept disaster porn feels like even more of a distant memory.

Bliz says June 27 2016 at 941 pm Everything about this movie was awful....bad direction terrible acting especially lead actress filled with cliches boring story ugly production and stupid twist...one of the most useless unnecessary sequels ever made-worse than trolls 2 Reply Trevor says May 18 2016 at 459 pm This review spoils the movie in the first paragraph. Room mixed with war of the worlds I mean come on. And for you to point out that Goodman IS the bad guy. The most entertaining part of this movie was trying to figure out was he good bad or crazy Reply Bliz says June 27 2016 at 943 pm U seriously were that dumb and bored that you had to play game with your self trying to figure out goodman was obviously a bad guy? Lamer than the movie are viewers like you Reply Hans says June 5 2016 at 123 am Who reads movie reviews until after theyve seen the movie? I never have. I want analysis. Reply thonguyen86 says May 10 2016 at 725 am Interesting movie  i like it Reply 10 Cloverfield Lane says April 11 2016 at 1059 am Very good trailer 10 Cloverfield Lane Reply Blanketyblank says April 3 2016 at 819 am You gave away too much in the first paragraph. Then you slam the enormously entertaining and well done Room. Just a bad review. Reply Bliz says June 27 2016 at 944 pm The movie is much worse. Reply Ben Durden says March 26 2016 at 520 pm I left that movie feeling embarrassed I had paid for it. What a total waste of time and money Reply Collin says March 17 2016 at 354 pm One of the best and most perfectly executed yet simple scenes is when they are playing trivial pursuit and John Goodmans word is Santa and he goes on about ""I know what youre up to... I see what you are doing... Im watching you"" AAAHHH That was the tensest I have felt in a long time. Reply Dan says March 13 2016 at 622 pm I have a real problem with the plot gaps in this movie. The earring the girls pictures shooting Emmett too twisting without explanation. Reply Richie says June 15 2016 at 357 pm Spoilers here-only read after watching the movie My take on the movie is this. John Goodman was a psychopath who used to keep a girl locked in his bomb shelter. She tried to get away and he killed her. Now Aliens have attacked and guess what he may be crazy but he has a bomb shelter... Michelle is going to be the replacement girl who happens to remind him of his daughter. Because of the alien attack he doesnt have time to be neat about it he just runs her off the road and abducts her. So for me all those plot gaps are consistent with John Goodmans character being a psychopath who used to have a girl locked in his bomb shelter. Half the fun while watching the movie was trying to figure out whether Goodman was Crazy or if Aliens have really attacked... Turns out the answers yes Reply Vincent J. Patti says March 11 2016 at 1149 pm Im a bit surprised at Mr. Changs idea that ""Cloverfield"" fans (like myself) would take umbrage with ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" for being a tribute to Cloverfield and making money off of this. If that were the case I do not believe that ""10"" would be able to boast half of its artistry and craftsmanship from writing to post-production. That it was filmed ""on a tripod"" - I say who cares There is fresh imagination suspense and thrills in both films (and these are films more than movies) much deserving of our praise and desire to see again or perhaps several times. Yes Mr. Goodman impresses. He frightened the bejesus out of me. Reply realmsman says March 10 2016 at 952 am What an over-indulgent unnecessarily vocabulary-injected pretentious piece of drivel. Find a movie critic who doesnt sound like hes trying to impress his Journalism professor. Reply Luke Niemiec says March 11 2016 at 339 am Also someone or something who uses too many big words is referred to as a ""sesquipedalian"". Hope that helps ;) Reply Luke Niemiec says March 11 2016 at 337 am Dude if you found any of the words in that article too complicated then maybe a trip back to high school would help. Theres nothing here that would be beyond the comprehension of an average 16 year-old and it conveyed the opinion of the critic very well. Reply H.M.L. says March 9 2016 at 947 pm Very good trailer. And it doesnt have the usual spoilers that have made me avoid trailers for a long time. Reply stevenkovacs says March 9 2016 at 307 pm Im In Reply Jake Spencer says March 9 2016 at 1258 pm Alien Invader? Its a giant monster Reply CloverFan86 says March 9 2016 at 1042 am Daniel Casey was the uncredited writer. Stuecken amp; Campbell dont deserve the kudos. Reply raven says March 9 2016 at 940 am well I know about the scenery and how the cast was in other movies but this review told me ZERO about this movie. Reply Rex says March 9 2016 at 1014 am Seriously? Are you high? And of course Im sure if it revealed even a smidgen too much youd be the first one on here tearing Variety a new one for popping your little bubble. This review tells you EVERYTHING you should want to know without actually spoiling anything. What the hell do you want? The script typed verbatim out for you? Reply brian Zebra says March 9 2016 at 853 am If it doesnt have a giant monster rampaging through the streets destroying beloved landmarks and killing tens of thousands then I am really not interested. Reply Denny Celestino S. (HybridSpeciesUS) says March 18 2016 at 403 pm 10 Cloverfield Lane looked better in the trailers. Just saw it today amp; it was a disappointment. Good acting but the movie is a bore. Doesnt deserve to be connected with the fun monster epic Cloverfield. Reply AbraCadabra says March 9 2016 at 1135 am Nah I agree with Zebra here. The only reason I watched the first one was because I wanted a monster movie. I got it I guess but the ratio of monster vs movie wasnt good enough for my tastes. If this one doesnt involve monsters - the skyscraper tall destructive kind - then Im not interested and mildly irritated that they used the name for a monster movie as though it were a sequel but wont involve monsters. Theyre under no obligation I realize but still seems like a slightly underhanded marketing ploy. Reply Jim Beck says March 9 2016 at 1010 am Dont worry -- a new Transformers movie is coming out soon to satisfy the mindless Trump supporters. Reply cwg46and2 says March 11 2016 at 444 am So the fella likes kaiju films and his disappointment that this kaijuless film is branded Cloverfield makes him a Trumpy?

Im looking forward to this new film that connects to that universe in an obviously intriguing way. Kudos to the filmmakers who keep the mystery alive in a time when trailers usually tell everything. Reply Wendy Caufield says March 8 2016 at 1003 pm I do not agree with Jen. Reply jen says March 8 2016 at 922 pm Cloverfield was an painful joke to watch. Why in the world do we want to see a second 10 Cloverfield movie? We dont. Reply Ken says March 10 2016 at 702 am Actually we do. Reply Jim Beck says March 9 2016 at 1017 am Im not a big fan of Cloverfield but it did try something different... and didnt have an ending that was wrapped in a pretty bow. Pretty much the world is doomed. lol But this movie seems to be completely different so anything that people didnt like about Cloverfield could very well be gone from this movie. Plus Goodman and Winstead? Im in Reply raven says March 9 2016 at 941 am agree 100%. the best part of Cloverfield was the hype machine behind it. the movie was an empty bag of stink.
