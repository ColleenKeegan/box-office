"Sparkle | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; sparkle ) Sparkle (United States 2012) August 17 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli Sparkle is a remake; the original was released theatrically in 1976. I have never seen that version but that didnt stem a powerful sense of dA(c)jA  vu while sitting through this one. Thats because Sparkle is an assembly of parts and pieces from other better movies - an overly familiar jumble of clichA(c)s mashed together. The only time Sparkle evidences energy is during the song performances of which there are too few. The half-baked melodrama provides an unappealing and overlong buffer between them that fails to justify the nearly two-hour running time. Sparkle represents the second major motion picture to highlight an ex-American Idol contestant. Jordin Sparks who won the singing contest is no match for Jennifer Hudson when it comes to acting chops. Shes okay - I have seen worse debuts from singers who want to play at acting - but her readings of lines are sometimes flat. No ones going to argue against the strength of her voice but she fails to generate a compelling character. Then again at least a part of the blame can be laid at the feet of writer/director Salim Akil. Meanwhile this is the final screen appearance of the late Whitney Houston who gets a chance to belt out one last song. Houston was never a great actress but at the height of her popularity she had presence. Thats gone and were left with a shadow of someone who once lit up the screen. In real life of course even the shadow is gone. Sparkle follows the misadventures of the title character (played by Sparks) a young aspiring singer/songwriter living in Detroit in 1968. She writes for her eldest sibling Tammy (Carmen Ejogo) who is the prettiest and sexiest of the three Anderson sisters. She meets an up-and-coming manager Stix (Derek Luke) who convinces Sparks and her other sister Dolores (Tika Sumpter) to form a girl band with Tammy as the lead singer. The group has some success even opening for Aretha Franklin but Tammys drug use and relationship with an abusive husband Satin (Mike Epps) cause her to be unfit for performing. A record deal collapses and the group disbands. But despite the objections of Sparks church-going mother Emma (Houston) the young woman refuses to give up her dream and pursues stardom on her own. The movie sounds like every other rags-to-riches movie ever made and it comes across as a threadbare knockoff. Without an acting performance of any note the characters never achieve life. And Akil (Jumping the Broom) shows little skill in conveying key moments. A scene in which Satin is shown chasing Sister with a belt provoked open laughter at the screening I attended. Ditto for a later sequences in which one character is struck in the back of the head with a poker and falls to the ground in slow motion. While theres life in the performance sequences this isnt Dreamgirls either. And at least one of the songs sounds like it was written for contemporary singers rather than for 60s groups. Period piece details in general are superficial. Sparkle wants to get away with re-creating the era through wardrobe hairstyles and clips of Martin Luther King on TV. Sparkle can boasts a rousing climax but the predictable resolution is hardly worth the investment necessary to get to it. To the extent theres anything to recommend about this movie its the music but the songs can be downloaded. Everything else is wearily familiar; even the most inexperienced movie-goer will be able to plot the storys trajectory after the first few minutes. Not having seen the first iteration of Sparkle I cant offer an opinion about whether this is a good or faithful remake. But I can say that standing on its own it isnt worth the price of admission.

Courtney Shea Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Aug. 17 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Aug. 16 2012 553PM EDT Comments AA Directed by Salim Akil Written by Mara Brock Akil and Howard Rosenman Starring Jordin Sparks Carmen Ejogo Whitney Houston Classification PG Country USA Language English Sparkle is a story about the transformative power of music the dark side of fame and a young church choirgirl with a dream... can you see how it might be hard to talk about the movie outside of the context of Whitney Houstons death? Lets try though. Because despite the seeming need to draw Michael Jackson-ian comparisons Sparkle was never going to be Houstons ""This Is It"" Tour - an epic comeback with which to relaunch her career. Instead the movie is a showcase vehicle for a new generation of young actress-hyphen-singers led at least titularly speaking by American Idol champ Jordin Sparks. Anyone who has seen Dream Girls Whats Love Got To Do With It? or even The Doors will find themselves in familiar (if inferior) territory here complete with all the giddy hallmarks of the late 60s music-group-on-the-rise sub-genre - musical montages with loads of hair and outfit changes a front wo/man whos gotten too big for their go-go boots and that scene where the big shot record producer struts into the dressing room to tell the young hopefuls that theyve got what it takes.Sparkles more specific narrative follows the Andrews sisters of Detroit. There is Sister (the sexy one played by Carmen Ejogo) Dolores (the smart one played by Tika Sumpter) and Sparkle (the talented virginal songwriter with a dream played by first time actor Sparks).In the Andrews household a girl either sticks to her Bible-studies or winds up poor pregnant and alone as was the fate of the family matriarch (Houston as Emma). In a scene that Im sort of surprised made it into the final cut (Houston died while Sparkle was in post-production) Sister reminisces a childhood where she would often find her mother passed out in a heap of her own vomit. Whitney or rather Emma retorts that that happened ""only once.""Of course the girls defy Mamas warnings and soon find themselves opening on the same circuit as Diana Ross and Marvin Gaye. All of their dreams are coming true until Sister strikes up a volatile love affair with a celebrity (Mike Epps as sleazy standup comedian Satin Struthers is standout if uncomfortably reminiscent of Laurence Fishburnes Oscar-nominated turn as Ike Turner in the aforementioned Tina Turner bio-pic).The irony of Sparkss performance (that she is solid enough but fails to sparkle in any way) will likely turn her career at least as far as movie making goes into another post-Idol cautionary tale. Egojo - who will almost certainly be labelled Beyonce Lite but is in fact more dynamic sexy and dare we say Bootylicious than the real thing - plays hardened vulnerability to perfection so much so that you wonder (given her 38 years) where Hollywood has been hiding her.This movie is not Houstons legacy - anyone who wants to hear that can download her double disc Greatest Hits collection or go check out the just-launched tribute exhibition at the Grammy museum in L.A. Houstons performance in Sparkle - essentially a series of camera-pandering ""diva expressions"" and a horrible red weave - sees her bloated and sweaty presumably fighting the demons that would soon derail her. Was she ever a great actress? No. I can recite most of The Bodyguard from memory and still I can concede that much.In the movies most poignant scene Emma performs a gospel standard for the congregation ""I sing because Im happy/I sing because Im free."" For fans its a fitting post-mortal epitaph. A reminder of what made Whitney sparkle.

Photo Jordin Sparks (left) and the late Whitney Houston star in the lackluster ""Sparkle."" Depending on your depth of feeling about Whitney Houston the Motown-era musical ""Sparkle"" will either feel like a fond (and sometimes cringe-inducing) farewell to an old friend or a wholly unremarkable entry in the already overcrowded star-is-born genre. Houston who shot the film just a few months before her death in February does get her moment of glory in a scene so pointed I find it hard to believe it wasnt re-edited after she died. Standing at the front of a church clad in a royal-purple cape and flanked by stained glass and a full choir the late singer belts out -- in a voice substantially huskier than in her ""Bodyguard"" days -- that shes ""singing because Im happy."" At my screening Im pretty sure there wasnt a dry eye in the house. If youre still mourning Houstons death its almost enough of a reason to go. But it does little to redeem the rest of this plodding story which often seems like a flat straightforward Supremes biopic in its adherence to seemingly pointless scenes and exposition. Director Salim Akil (""Jumping the Broom"") working from a screenplay by his wife Mara Brock Akil (TVs ""The Game"") gets the retro visuals just right and some stage performances do well sparkle. But theyre too few and far between surrounded by cardboard dialogue (""Ill sign them"" shouts Curtis Armstrong as a Columbia records exec watching the group backstage) and a now-well-worn ""Behind the Music"" trajectory. PHOTOS DEAD MOVIE STARS The remake of a 1976 film starring a young Irene Cara its the story of three sisters Sparkle (""American Idol"" winner Jordin Sparks) Sister (British actress Carmen Ejogo) and Dolores (Tika Sumpter a real pistol who should have gotten more screen time). They try to make it as a girl group in the burgeoning Detroit Motown scene of 1968 (updated from the setting of the original 1950s Harlem). Cee Lo Green pops up as a club performer early on confirming that musically its the era in which he really belongs -- and that he rocks a smoking jacket like nobodys business. Houston the girls churchgoing single mother Emma ""used to be a professional singer"" (the first of many times youll flinch) who turned to substance abuse (flinch again) before finding God so theyre doing the singing thing on the down-low sneaking out to perform in smoky clubs once Moms gone to bed. Its somewhat hard to believe they pull off these weekly gigs their star on the rise without Emma knowing. Or it would be if -- Im sorry but its true -- Houston didnt look as if shed just been woken up from a nap nearly every time shes on camera. No its not hard to believe this person would be a sound sleeper. Still Houston does get a few amusing moments in her supporting role dancing along with a band on TV before snapping it off and commanding the girls Bible club to hit the books or training a steely eye on her daughter being chatted up by a young man after church. Sparkle the groups songwriter is wooed by their young and handsome manager Stix (the always-earnest Derek Luke) but worries hes using her to get closer to sister Sister. She Sister in turn has fallen under the spell of Mike Epps as sleazy TV comedian Satin (what is it with the ridiculous S-names in this town?) who traffics in cheap race-riot jokes and dabbles in hard drugs and domestic violence. When Sister announces at the familys Sunday dinner that shes going to marry him things get ugly and Houstons character ends up on the defensive ""I passed out a few times sure but youd never see me laying in my own vomit"" (Wince.) As the group Sister and the Sisters begins to make a name for itself the film briefly takes off with a series of lively performances; Ejogo is a particularly dynamic and gorgeous singer and all three young actresses wear the increasingly glam period outfits well. But eventually Sisters bruises and track marks courtesy of Satin start to show through the cover-up and her downfall takes center stage in a way that feels awfully close to a Lifetime TV movie. Its always telling when viewers giggle during a scene thats intended to be shocking and tragic as they did here. Meanwhile Dee wisely decides to high-tail it to medical school and Sparkle is left wondering if she should strike out on her own. For a movie called ""Sparkle"" the absolutely least interesting or central thing about it is Sparkle (and Sparks) although the ""Idol"" singer does bust out one impressive performance. In any case I hope not to have to type that name again unless Im covering a My Little Pony resurgence.

Starring Jordin Sparks Whitney Houston Derek Luke Director Salim Akil Running time 151 Release Opened Aug 17 2012  Editorial Review Ann Hornaday reviews Sparkle By Ann HornadayFriday August 17 2012A sudsy eye-catching bauble that should have been a pop-infused piece of escapism but instead turned into an unwitting elegy ""Sparkle"" arrives freighted with more than its share of expectations. A re-make of the beloved 1976 musical starring Irene Cara (and not incidentally featuring the music of Curtis Mayfield) the updated version will forever be known the final screen appearance of Whitney Houston who died in February during post-production. While ""Sparkle"" doesnt give the audience a lasting memory of Houstons voice at its most soaring it does manage to provide a lingering sense of loss mixed with celebration and grim irony. Houston plays the disapproving mother of a daughter who longs to make it big as a singer; in a role that plays like a cautionary mirror version of Houstons own fatal battles she warns against the depredations of an entertainment industry that indulges and exploits young talent just as intently as it nurtures it. Happily though Houstons presence in ""Sparkle"" isnt maudlin or discomfiting. She even has some wonderfully amusing scenes as Emma the tight-lipped kerchiefed martinet whose Saturday-night refrain to her girls is always the same ""Curl your hair. Go to bed. Church tomorrow."" Whether they listen is another story. As ""Sparkle"" opens in Detroit in 1968 Sister (Carmen Ejogo) and her little sister Sparkle (Jordin Sparks) have snuck out to a nightclub where Sparkle has convinced her sister to sing one of the songs shes written. (And yes thats Cee Lo Green in a blink-and-youll-miss-him early cameo.) In the course of Sisters vamping bombshell debut she and Sparkle attract the attention of a newbie manager named Stix (Derek Luke) who eventually will persuade them to try for the big time; even Sister and Sparkles level-headed sister Dee (Tika Sumpter) will agree to don all manner of sequins wigs and eyelashes-out-to-here in an effort to help Sparkle achieve her dreams. One of the films most satisfying moments is when Dee -- who has taken sharp note of the changes sweeping black culture in that era -- abandons her processed bob for a chic close-cropped natural cut. Fans familiar with the original -- or any number of backstage showbiz morality tales -- know that plenty of hardship must ensue before inevitable glitzy triumph. Sister will take up with a no-count comedian named Satin (played with appropriately silky sinister aplomb by Mike Epps) and Emma -- a former singer herself -- will do all she can to keep her kids from making the same mistakes she did. But in between the obstacles ""Sparkle"" trafficks in the same gorgeous Motown style -- sonic and visual -- that made the original film and ""Dreamgirls"" after it such delectable fun. The pulp melodrama may be slathered on like so much frosted pink lip gloss but director Salim Akil (""Jumping the Broom"") knows just when to cut it with a dollop of warmth or down-home humor. (The scene in which Sister brings Satin home for Sunday dinner rings with particular flinty honesty about tensions within the African American community.) The filmmakers have kept Mayfields stand-out songs from the original including ""Jump"" ""Hooked On Your Love"" and ""Something He Can Feel"" performed by Ejogo with a sinuous sulk. The tunes contributed by R. Kelly dont quite hold up in part because their arrangements feel so jarringly of-this-moment. But Sparks does a terrific job with her big number a barn burner called ""One Wing"" on which she holds her own before three backup singers an orchestra and an enormous gospel choir. Even when Mara Brock Akils script descends into lurid hackneyed schematics the performances in ""Sparkle"" possess verve and seriousness especially those by Luke (a consistently appealing screen presence) and the attractive main actresses who judiciously balance earthy focus and divalike fabulosity. For her part Houston delivers a steady if muted rendition of the classic hymn ""His Eye is on the Sparrow"" which finds her in dramatically diminished voice but powerful emotional form. ""Sparkle"" may have begun as nothing more than a tuneful diverting nostalgia trip but it turns out to be a surprisingly poignant swan song.Contains mature thematic content involving domestic abuse and drug abuse some violence profanity and smoking.

Working from his wifes screenplay director Salim Akil (""Jumping the Broom"") ages the girls up a bit moves them up a decade to 1968 Detroit and updates a couple of Curtis Mayfields original songs while adding a handful of new Motown-worthy ditties written by R. Kelly. Generally speaking they have improved on the source material as much as possible while still succumbing to some of the same hoary showbiz beats. Sparkle (Jordin Sparks of ""American Idol"" fame) is a mostly meek songwriter whos perfectly happy to see older sibling Sister (Carmen Ejogo) belt out her ballads to a paying audience. Together they catch the eye of would-be promoter Stix (Derek Luke) and with his encouragement and the support of middle sister Dolores (Tika Sumpter) they form a musical trio unbeknownst to their strict mother (Whitney Houston in her final film performance). Alas temptation must arise and does in the form of stand-up comedian/sugar daddy Satin (Mike Epps) bringing drugs abuse and all-around woe into the picture. Epps like the film itself is effective if never subtle at straddling the line between wide-grinning charms and hardly hidden insecurities. Until Satin arrives and even for a while after he does Akils remake is a warmer snappier affair that treats the politics of the time period matter-of-factly. Integration gets mentioned as an off-handed joke people discuss riots more than they dodge them and the face of Martin Luther King Jr. commonly shows up on any given television but the film never proceeds to take on more social issues than it can handle. Class struggles and family dilemmas are fodder enough for the plot and although no life lesson here comes as a surprise the bond between Sparks Ejogo and Sumpter is a convincing one and until the requisite Big Moment where she sings in church Houston managed to be an amusingly concerned mother hen before the intentional parallels to her own off-screen career come to light. Of course lines like ""Was my life not enough of a cautionary tale for you?"" cant escape a darker resonance following her passing earlier this year making a somewhat maudlin film seem that much more emotional. The Akils substituted a new audience-baiting climax for a death by overdose in the original film instead sending that character off to prison and unwittingly avoiding further comparison to Houstons own life while making room for additional redemption on her characters part. The third acts no less rags-to-riches routine than what precedes it but before the backstage melodrama begins to dominate its charming to see Stix finance his new endeavor through pool hall hustling or to see doodles of Sparkles name on a marquee in the margins of her own songbook. These touches make the familiar go down that much smoother and goodness knows that these girls can in fact sing their hearts out once they take the stage. When Sparkle eventually makes the case to a recording exec for just how many hits she can milk each of her lifes hardships for it feels like the passive admission on part of the filmmakers that they retain certain cliches much as one covers old standards. This particular cover works best when it hits a few new notes along its well-worn way to stardom.

Photo Alicia Gbur Associated Press Image 8 of 8 Sparkle review Carmen Ejogos star quality 1 / 8 Back to Gallery Sparkle Musical drama. Starring Jordin Sparks Carmen Ejogo and Whitney Houston. Directed by Salim Akil. (PG-13. 116 minutes.) ""American Idol"" winner Jordin Sparks makes her movie debut in ""Sparkle"" and just that much - that half sentence - will probably keep a number of people from reading what follows. But ""Sparkle"" was made by smart people who built on their stars strengths accounted for her weaknesses and didnt lean on her to carry the whole picture. Sparks strengths include not just a powerful voice but also a radiant niceness and that becomes part of the story. ""Sparkle"" also has the advantage of the late Whitney Houston who plays Sparks mother. Inevitably there are moments sprinkled throughout that will remind you of Houstons life and ultimate fate as when Mom - a woman who almost made it as a singer - says that the music business almost killed her. But mostly its just a pleasure to receive this unexpected gift to hear Houston tear into a gospel number and to witness the maturity and the gravity that she brings to the role of a single mother raising three daughters. Yet when all is said and done I suspect that very few people will walk out of ""Sparkle"" talking about either Sparks or Houston at least not at first. Instead they will be saying ""Who was that?"" And theyll be referring to Carmen Ejogo who plays Sparks older sister. If there is any justice Ejogo will become very famous very soon. As in maybe today. Its rare to see someone become a movie star right before your eyes but thats what happens with Ejogo in ""Sparkle."" She has apparently been making feature films for 15 years but always in small or smallish parts. Here she has what is nominally the supporting role except that she sings a half dozen songs to Sparks two and her role is the focus of the drama. For an actress this was the opportunity of a lifetime and Ejogo plays it that way. She leaves nothing out holds nothing back. ""Sparkle"" takes place in mid-60s Detroit where three daughters live in a house with their mother (Houston) a former wild woman who amended her ways to become a devout Christian. Sparkle (Sparks) is a natural songwriter but shy as a performer. Her older sister known as Sister (Ejogo) back home following a divorce is magnetic and sensuous onstage and she has a voice too. But she has never really gotten anywhere professionally. Meanwhile the middle sister Dolores (Tika Sumpter) is planning to go to medical school. An enterprising young man (Derek Luke) hoping to become the next Berry Gordy gets the idea that the three sisters should form a girl group and most of ""Sparkle"" tells the usual showbiz tale of trial and triumph. But mainly ""Sparkle"" is the story of Sister - her hunger for security her resentment of her mother and her mix of brave and greedy impulses. With every other character in the film you know who they are just by looking at them. Sister is the one to watch and wonder about. Make no mistake ""Sparkle"" is heavy on the melodrama and hits every nasty landing on its way to the ground floor - the bad marriage the drug problem the violence and despair. But what distinguishes ""Sparkle"" and engages the emotions even if we feel weve seen it all before is director Salim Akils investment in truth. When Sister for example leads a rehearsal while strung out on cocaine Ejogo looks strung out - enough so that its a disturbing sight. Nothing in ""Sparkle"" stands in for something else. Everything is inhabited so that grief looks like grief a weary mother looks like a weary mother and a bad husband is played - convincingly by Mike Epps - as a truly evil man. ""Sparkle"" was never going to be a masterpiece or anything close to it but when a director gets everything out of a script and more thats notable. Its even better when he leads a previously unappreciated performer to a supporting actress Oscar and that might be what were talking about here. Because when it comes down to it Sparks makes ""Sparkle"" pleasant and Houston makes it interesting. But its only Carmen Ejogo who makes ""Sparkle"" genuinely worth seeing.

About the movieSparkle1/2 out of fourStars Jordin Sparks Whitney Houston Derek Luke Carmen Ejogo Mike Epps Tika Sumpter Omari Hardwick CeeLo Green Director Salim AkilDistributor TriStar Pictures Rating PG-13 for mature thematic content involving domestic abuse and drug material and for some violence language and smoking Running time 1 hour 56 minutes Opens Friday nationwideThough Tammy has a guy who loves her in Levi (Omari Hardwick) shes seduced by the glamorous life offered by comedian Satin (Mike Epps).Sparkle is a spirited songwriter who convinces Tammy to perform one of her songs at a local club. That leads to the three sisters trying out for a local musical contest spurred on by Stix (Derek Luke) who becomes their manager and also has eyes for Sparkle.The trio are a wonderfully appealing group inspired by Motown and a melange of Ramp;B and gospel music. Dolores is sassy and Sparkle is spunky but Tammys sultry moves attract most of the attention. Sparkle tries to keep her sisters united but Tammys life takes a downward spiral as she moves in with the smooth but cruel Satin.While Sparks has a genuine sparkle and an amazing voice she doesnt get to fully show it off until more than 90 minutes into the movie. Houston is convincing as the loving but inflexible mom. Houston has a singing solo while at church but shes clearly a supporting player in the movie which she also executive-produced. Its too bad Sparkle trots out so many A Star is Born-style cliches. Fortunately the film is full of show-stopping musical numbers that all but drown out the predictable story.Envisioned as a starring vehicle for Sparks Sparkle is also a fitting curtain call for Houston. Her characters ultimate willingness to acknowledge her daughters dreams and encourage the musical aspirations of the next generation is a lovely final tribute.

Set in the late 60s it tells the story of three sisters from middle-class Detroit who form a girl group sort of like the Supremes. Theyre astoundingly talented they want to be famous and at one point they get their shot at a major deal with Columbia Records. But all sorts of things keep getting in the way like an abusive coke-sniffing celebrity boyfriend -- what happens to him will leave your jaw on the floor -- and more than that their oppressively uptight church-lady mother played with teasing confidence and force by Whitney Houston in her final screen role. The movie is a remake of the 1976 ersatz-Supremes Hollywood fable that starred Irene Cara and the earlier films setting -- the late 50s and early 60s -- made sense. Transplanting the material ahead nearly a decade to the era of race riots and black power (when the classic Motown sound was in fact already starting to fade) hurts the movies credibility since it is now all the harder to believe that three feisty grown women are still living in their puritanical mothers house because theyre too cowed to go out on their own. From its opening scene set inside a hopping Detroit nightclub Sparkle is charged with a synthetically corny high tension. (Cee Lo Green shows up in that scene and does a fine job of playing a conk-haired funk-soul relic who loves the ladies but then he completely vanishes from the movie.) The three sisters are each cut from a very different cloth. The quietly ambitious Sparkle a brilliant songwriter is played by the sixth-season American Idol winner Jordin Sparks who proves to be a lot like Irene Cara -- that is shes pretty in a slightly pained way and wholesomely sincere to the point of being a bit boring. The whippersnapper Dolores (Tika Sumpter) mostly stays in the background except when she explodes in moments of vengeful high dudgeon. And then theres the sister known literally as Sister whos the star of the group and is played by the ravishingly sexy and accomplished British actress Carmen Ejogo. In this role she looks and acts strikingly like a demon-driven down-and-dirty Beyonce and her scenes with Mike Epps as her charismatic but hateful comedian lover are the most potent in the film. The truth is that whenever Sister is on screen were a little unsure why the movie is named after anyone else. Sparkle uses some of the same imitation-Motown numbers by Curtis Mayfield that powered the 1976 version along with new songs by R. Kelly. The music is all highly competent and frankly just unmemorable enough to make you wish that you were hearing authentic period chestnuts instead. The trouble with Sparkle isnt that its overwrought (thats whats sometimes fun about it). Its that everything in the movie is derivative and third-hand a copy of a copy. The film is pulp thats been fed through a strainer with bits and pieces squeezed out of a dozen other better movies (Whats Love Got to Do With It Lady Sings the Blues and Dreamgirls to name just a few). At times its like a Joan Crawford neurotic-mother fantasy and the gravelly conviction of Whitney Houstons performance proves that this could have been the first step not merely in a comeback but in a major re-invention. She had the instincts of a superb character actress. At other times the movie is a girl-group biopic that never quite delivers the charge of success that were longing to see. Jordin Sparks big climactic on-stage number is supposed to do that but to me its just a testament to the way that too many Idol graduates with their how-many-notes-can-I-cram-inside-a-note technical bravura short-circuit any true connection with the audience. Sparkle is never more than an overheated mediocrity. The one thing it isnt however is dull.

"Sparkle review Whitney Houston shines brightest | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesSparkle review Whitney Houston shines brightestSparkle is no Dreamgirls but it is the final movie for Whitney Houston and the first for American Idol winner Jordin Sparks.The death of Whitney Houston centre is hard to forget while watching her performance in Sparkle.  (Alicia Gbur / TriStar Pictures)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Aug. 16 2012Sparkle(out of 4)Starring Jordin Sparks Whitney Houston Carmen Ejogo Tika Sumpter Derek Luke and Mike Epps. Directed by Salim Akil. 116 minutes. Opening Friday at major theatres. PGGirl-group musical melodrama Sparkle hardly shines destined to only be remembered as the last onscreen performance from troubled diva Whitney Houston who died in February at age 48 just months after finishing filming.Its sure no Dreamgirls but there are moments of pleasure amid the predictable scenes of success drugs and men who do women wrong in the story of a trio of Detroit songbird sisters who rise Supremes-like to stardom despite the disapproval of their protective iron-willed mama Emma (Houston).Article Continued BelowTheres also the thinnest thread of an interesting story there that could have added dramatic heft to Sparkle with flashy black comic Satin (well played by Mike Epps) who has become a hit on white TV talk shows by making fun of black people.American Idol winner and so-so actress Jordin Sparks takes the title role of good girl Sparkle whose name evokes images of My Little Pony characters with every mention. A remake of the 1976 flick that starred Fames Irene Cara in the title role the action moves from 1950s Harlem to late-1960s Detroit which opens the door on deep Motown-inspired grooves for flashily costumed production numbers that give Sparkle a leg up on its sappy and predictable story.Along with sexy sister Sister (yes it gets confusing) played by looker Carmen Ejogo (The Brave One) and smart sis Dolores (Tika Sumpter the best actress of the three) they start a singing trio that catches the eye of wannabe manager Stix (Derek Luke).They have to sneak out of the house to avoid the wrath of God-fearing Emma who was burned by unnamed forces when she tried and failed to be a singer. She lectures her girls on the evils of baby-making music and proudly stands as a ""cautionary tale"" as to why they need to go to church stay in school and engage in righteous activities.Sadly Houstons acceptable performance as a strong woman who speaks her truth is overshadowed by the ill health and raspy voice that shows in some scenes and an overwrought solo of the gospel hymn ""His Eye is on the Sparrow"" where she dramatically pauses to gaze heavenwards and thank Jesus.Every scene Houston is in comes with the added distraction of her death especially when she whispers to Sparkle that shell sit in a back row of the theatre when she sings ""so I dont upstage you.""With original music from the 1976 movie including Curtis Mayfields sexy groove ""Something He Can Feel"" -- a hit for both Aretha Franklin and En Vogue -- and new tunes by R. Kelly the soundtrack is the best part of Sparkle especially scenes that evoke the thumping heat of packed Detroit dance floors.Directed by Jumping the Brooms Salim Akil the emphasis is on showbiz flash and liberal splashes of schmaltz as Sparkle charges its way to a predictable concert ending that abandons the 1960s timeframe -- something that happens regularly with anachronistic thumps throughout the movie -- without a second look.Theres a fresh eagerness in Sparkss performance that helps sand off some of her rough edges as a fledgling actress and when the three sisters shimmy and sway and sell a song it helps erase the awkwardness of the rest of Sparkle. But nothing takes the spotlight off Houston when shes onscreen sometimes ill-used in clownish behaviours that serve as a cautionary tale all their own.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

She plays Emma the strict single mother of three daughters who make a splash as a Supremes-like trio. Slideshow Sparkle Whitney Houstons film finale Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about Sparkle >> If youre like me youll lose it when Houston takes uneasy flight with ""His Eye Is on the Sparrow."" And if youre like me youll wonder why given the circumstances of Houstons untimely death in February the filmmakers kept the scene in which Emma defends herself to the eldest daughter ""I passed out a couple of times sure. But I never ever laid in my own vomit. Was my life not enough of a cautionary tale to you?"" Forgive them their trespasses. Directed by Salim Akil (maker of the sprightly Jumping the Broom) with an updated screenplay by his wife Mara Brock Akil (TVs Girlfriends) Sparkle is a solid entertainment with a winning debut by Jordin Sparks in the title role. The screenplay reframes Effie maid to a mob family in the 1976 original as Emma a failed entertainer and born-again church lady. It reimagines her daughters Sparkle Sister (Carmen Ejogo) and Dolores (Tika Sumpter) respectively as musician material girl and militant. In the title role Sparks an American Idol winner plays the middle sibling as the quiet one eclipsed by the frankly sexual Sister and the politically outspoken Dolores. Sparkle channels her feelings into lyrics that she is too modest to sing herself. As she puts it ""Im no Diana or Aretha."" Thus Sister (sultry Ejogo who steals the movie from Sparks just as shamelessly as Lonette McKee stole the original from Irene Cara) becomes the lead singer in their act Sister and the Sisters. Naturally the girls have to sneak out to perform at open-mike night where Sparkle catches the eye of Stix (Derek Luke) a would-be promoter. It is Sister who catches the eye of everyone else. The late Curtis Mayfields soulful songs and Ruth Carters kicky costumes provide the film with authentic period tone and texture. R. Kelly the films music consultant supplied some new songs including the ballad ""One Wing"" nicely delivered by Sparks. While the song is meant to be a poetic description of Sisters trying to rise above her limitations one cant help but hear it as an elegy for Houston. Where the original Sparkle was a ghetto melodrama with equal parts mob and music the Akils have refashioned it into a saga of family rupture and reconciliation. The remake has as many scenes set in church as in nightclubs. Is it because Bishop T.D. Jakes is one of the films producers that the church is presented as a most important musical venue? The broad-stroke film succeeds in a cheer-the-hero hiss-the-villain kind of way. Mike Epps radiates sinister charisma as Satin a self-hating stand-up comedian. All too eager to make money by making blacks the butt of his jokes Satin is the films villain more tormented than the standard drug dealer. Akils incident-filled movie often feels choppy as though significant scenes had been cut. Its flow might have been smoother had songs advanced the plot instead of stopping the show. In the end I felt I had watched one star Houston dim as I watched another Ejogo born. Contact Carrie Rickey at carriedrickeygmail.com. Follow her at http//www.carrierickey.com.

The first ""Oceans"" mainly coasts on Rat Pack nostalgia and the 1976 version of ""Sparkle"" is usually connected to the album of Aretha Franklin singing the films Curtis Mayfield songs even though the Queen of Soul is neither seen nor heard in the movie itself. The new ""Sparkle"" greatly improves on its source material screenwriter Mara Brock Akil (a TV vet making her big-screen debut) keeps the plot but gives the characters enough depth and background to explain their actions; and director Salim Akil (the witty ""Jumping the Broom"") and his crew give the movie visual flair while letting the songs propel the story forward. While ""Sparkle"" often gets lumped in with ""Dreamgirls"" (the first movie predated the Broadway musical by five years) the two stories have more differences than overlaps. Here we have three sisters Sparkle (Jordin Sparks) who is a brilliant songwriter but too shy to take the stage herself; Sister (Carmen Ejogo) who craves the spotlight and everything that comes with it; and Dolores (Tika Sumpter) who is happy to harmonize with her siblings until she can get into med school. Whatever musical dreams this talented trio has they have to operate behind the back of their disciplinarian mother Emma (the late Whitney Houston) who had her own experiences in show business and would rather spare her daughters her troubled fate. But in true ""Mama I Want to Sing"" fashion Sparkle attracts the eye of up-and-coming manager Stix (Derek Luke) and their budding musical careers are off and running. Sister winds up getting seduced by Satin Struthers (Mike Epps) a self-described ""coon"" comedian who mocks black people to the delight of white audiences and drugs and domestic abuse follow quickly. Can the trio keep it together when temptation beckons all around them? Will Sparkle learn to stop hiding her light under a bushel? And whats going to happen when Emma finds out? The answers to these and other questions arent too tricky to solve but Brock Akils script makes these hoary show-biz cliches feel fresh and vital. And even though the film gives us a fantasy version of late-1960s Detroit (riots are mentioned but never seen in this gleaming candy-colored paradise) the film zips along from one terrific number to the next. Speaking of the numbers the Mayfield originals stand out as far superior to the three new songs by R. Kelly but the latter turn up so late in the film that they dont exhaust the goodwill generated by the former. And no even these talented ladies cant touch Arethas hem but they do right by the songs in their own way. Apart from a few minor quibbles (Stixs cousin Levi played by Omari Hardwick gets set up as a major character and then unceremoniously disappears for much of the film) the main weakness of ""Sparkle"" comes from the actress playing the title role. ""American Idol"" winner Sparks is a beautiful young woman with a great singing voice but shes too much of a Disney Channel majorette for this movie. Sex and soul and societal upheaval is going on all around her but shes only willing to dig so deep. In their scenes together you can almost feel Luke trying to be passionate enough for both of them. Sparks tenuousness as an actress suffers all the more next to the powerful ensemble surrounding her from the magnetic Luke to the carnal Ejogo to the wickedly charismatic Epps. Sumpter it should be noted steals scene after scene with her raised-eyebrow take-no-prisoners deadpan humor. Its hard of course not to think about the tragic passing of Whitney Houston while watching the film but ""Sparkle"" makes for a strong farewell for this troubled artist. Her acting is spot-on from her tough-love for her children to her distrust of the secular world and its pleasures. (She also rocks a leopard poncho and a purple cape like no one since Elizabeth Taylor in ""X Y and Zee."") Houstons vocals on ""His Eye Is on the Sparrow"" may not equal her abilities at her apex but she still brings real heft to the gospel standard. This is a much shinier ""Sparkle"" in everything from the cinematography (by Anastas N. Michos) to its repeated references to Sparkles virginity (you can probably thank show-biz clergyman T.D. Jakes one of the films producers for that nugget) but its a bright and breezy musical that puts a breath of spring in this clammy late-summer season. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

BOTTOM LINE Houstons triumphant performance -- her last -- is just one of many high points in this fun frothy energetic musical. CAST Jordin Sparks Carmen Ejogo Whitney Houston Derek Luke LENGTH 156 ""Sparkle"" began production as a showcase for the ""American Idol"" winner Jordin Sparks but its destined to be remembered as the final film for Whitney Houston who died in February. Her role is small but her performance is a triumph and her heart-stopping gospel number clearly meant as a comeback announcement now has the spine-tingling feel of an epitaph. That moment alone would make ""Sparkle"" worth seeing. But ""Sparkle"" has much more to offer. Its a fun sudsy tale of show-biz ups and downs with an endearing Sparks in the title role as one of three singing siblings in Motown-era Detroit. Youve seen this story before most recently in ""Dreamgirls"" so youre probably familiar with types like the spotlight-hogging Sister (a remarkable Carmen Ejogo) levelheaded Dolores (Tika Sumpter) budding music-mogul Sticks (Derek Luke) and the nasty-humored Satin (a very good Mike Epps). Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Houston plays the girls mother Emma Anderson whose back story -- a failed singing career and a drinking problem -- has an uncanny resonance given Houstons lifelong troubles. ""Was my life not enough of a cautionary tale for you?"" Emma says one of several lines that now ring even truer than intended. ""Sparkle"" freshens this familiar material with energetic direction by Salim Akil and a sharp script by his wife Mara Brock Akil. The buoyant musical numbers genuinely capture the excitement of the era partly because ""Sparkle"" is a remake of a 1976 drama (starring a young Irene Cara and Philip Michael Thomas) with original songs by the great Curtis Mayfield. Several reappear here including the Supremes-ish ""Hooked on Your Love"" and the ballad ""Something He Can Feel"" sung by the three stars in eye-catching costumes and with lush new arrangements (R. Kelly is the films ""executive musical consultant""). Though the story flags near the end ""Sparkle"" is always a treat and a bittersweet reminder of what Houston could have kept giving us.

Matt Gillmer Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Sparkle"" commands attention because its the last movie for Whitney Houston and the first for ""American Idol"" winner Jordin Sparks. The film tells the story of three sisters who want to become the next Supremes over the protestations of their church-going single mom (Houston) a former Ramp;B singer who got burned by the music biz. No this isnt a redo of ""Dreamgirls."" This is a makeover of 1976s ""Sparkle"" which starred ""Flashdance"" singer Irene Cara. Houston was 13 when it came out and the film reportedly inspired her so much that she watched it over and over as a teenager and later secured the remake rights. Houston who died three months after filming wrapped holds her own although she looks a bit out of it at times. The camera adores Sparks though she is no Jennifer Hudson. The music and characterizations are strong. But what prevents ""Sparkle"" from shimmering is a predictable plot. In short The oldest daughter and lead singer Sister (the tough and sultry Carmen Ejogo) moves in with a high-living comedian (the pimpish Mike Epps). When Sister ends up in jail for accidentally killing her abusive beau and the middle sister goes off to college Sparkle (Sparks) a reluctant singer but gifted songwriter steps up to the microphone solo. And -- guess what? -- Houston the conflicted but proud mama is clapping in the theater. ""The Bodyguard"" star gives a curious performance in her final role which is a modest one. At times she looks to be in a glassy-eyed haze which doesnt befit a rehabbed Bible-teaching dress shop owner. Her lone vocal performance comes on ""His Eye Is on the Sparrow"" an old spiritual and her once gorgeous stratospheric voice sounds weathered and dulled. But she looks clear-eyed and handsome when she shows up at Sparkles big concert. As the insecure innocent ingenue Sparks 22 seems a bit tentative at first. But like her character she gains her footing. The scene in which she and Houston have the big argument about Sparkle moving out of the comfortable family home to pursue her musical dreams is so powerful that it doesnt feel like acting. One disconnect throughout the movie though is Sparks hair which is too long and luxe for a black woman of that era (the film is set in 1968 Detroit); most of the other characters look more authentic. Alicia Gbur TriStar Pictures Sparkle (Jordin Sparks) and Emma (Whitney Houston) in ""Sparkle."" As a singer Sparks shines. Her payoff tune is the R. Kelly-penned ""One Wing"" which could be a female answer to his ""I Believe I Can Fly."" Kelly wrote three new numbers for Sparks. The film also reprises some Curtis Mayfield-written selections from the original ""Sparkle"" including ""Something He Can Feel."" Sparks already has started shooting her second film a music-free indie drama with former ""Idol"" finalist Hudson who won a best supporting Oscar for her debut in ""Dreamgirls."" If Sparks goes on to enjoy success on the screen ""Sparkle"" will be remembered as her first film; otherwise its destined to be known only as Houstons last role.

Hell Dreamgirls did a better job of fictionalizing the story of the Supremes into a viable musical. The new Sparkle is a formula job from scene one to dead end. Set in Detroit in the late 1960s with Motown in flower Sparkle casts Houston as the domineering mother of three daughters who form a girl group behind mamas back. Sister (Carmen Ejogo) is the troubled bombshell who fronts the group called - ready for it? - Sister and Her Sisters. Dee (Tika Sumpter) doesnt mind singing backup because she has her eye on being a doctor. Its Sparkle (Jordin Sparks) a churchy mamas girl who does mind. Sparkle writes all the songs and yearns to be a STAR. Oh brother. Director Salim Akil hits every cliche in the script and adds visual triteness of his own. Sparks the Season Six American Idol winner has a lovely smile and no discernible range as an actress. So her final transformation falls flat. Still theres one scene that almost redeems this mess of a movie. Its Houston in church singing ""His Eye Is On the Sparrow."" She gives it everything she has. And what a glory abides in her voice. In a movie that feels fake to its core Houston is the genuine article. She will be much missed.

Daily Edition Login to download Sparkle Film Review 1100 AM PDT 8/16/2012 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS An upgraded remake of a Motown girl group musical bids farewell to Whitney Houston. TWITTER In her final acting role Whitney Houston portrays the imperious matriarch of a late 60s-era girl group featuring Jordin Sparks as an aspiring soul diva. The look styles dialogue and attitudes all feel more 21st century than 1968 but this new Sparkle still sparkles more brightly than its 1976 namesake which was a sort of rough draft for Dreamgirls. Like its predecessor both melodramatic and predictable in illustrating the rough-and-tumble rise of a girl group in the black music scene this new version pops with energy and adds welcome new angles to the plot and characters. And there is also a vibrant Whitney Houston both as executive producer and in an important role in no way looking like she wouldnt survive until the films release. The Sony/TriStar musical drama looks to deliver modest-to-decent returns in late summer release with a good home-viewing career in store. PHOTOS Whitney Houstons Death and the Grammy Awards Scramble Timeline of a Tragedy Set in Harlem in 1958 the original featured Joel Schumachers first produced screenplay was directed by ace film editor Sam OSteen and derived most of its force from Lonette McKees sensational performance as the gorgeous and oldest member of a three-sister singing act aiming for the big time. Unfortunately she was gone before the movie was half over. Evidently recognizing that the earlier script was a connect-the-dots affair with little meat on its bones screenwriter Mara Brock Akil has not only brought the action forward by 10 years but made well-judged decisions about how to revise and moderately enrich the main characters most of whom bear the same names as before. At first the ""Sister and Her Sisters"" singing group like the film itself gets by on the heart-stopping sex appeal of the Diana Ross-like lead singer dynamically played with no shortage of allure by the stunning Carmen Ejogo. Like her siblings appealing but virginal songwriter Sparkle (Jordin Sparks) and down-to-earth aspiring med student Dee (Tika Sumpter) Sister lives at home with their mother Emma (Houston) but cant wait to get out and sees musical success as her best shot. One positive alteration right out of the box is changing the mother from what was frankly a boring worn-out domestic to a relatively prosperous middle-class character who never made it as a pop singer but can still bring down the house wailing gospel at church. Emmas past failure hangs over her daughters like a stationary cloud and Houston does utter one line that reverberates with inescapable real-life implications ""Was my life not enough of a cautionary tale for you?"" STORY Hollywoods Undercover Hitmakers Salim and Mara Brock Akil As the group begins to attract attention Sister is courted by the earnest but penniless Levi (Omari Hardwick) who cant offer her what she really wants. One who can is the elegant local operator Satin (Mike Epps) a character who in the original was a standard-issue tough thug but here has been intriguingly reconceived as a smug condescending comedian whose racial humor plays well with whites but not to fellow blacks. Accompanied wherever he goes by an albino factotum Satin sweeps Sister off her feet but takes her to a darker dire place. For her part the bashful Sparkle receives no end of encouragement and amorous attention from aspiring music manager Stix (Derek Luke) who sees it as his appointed task in life to make Sparkle realize her potential not only as a songwriter but as a performer; for her Sister was always meant to be the star with her as backup. The hyper-realist Dee wins points by bluntly admitting how she knows that nobody even notices her when her sisters are around -- at least until she becomes the first in the neighborhood to get an Afro haircut. Through all the adversity and turmoil -- compounded most of all by Sisters drug addiction and abusive relationship as well as by Emmas stern disapproval of her daughters career aspirations which drives them all away -- Akil and her director-husband Salim Akil (last years Jumping the Broom) keep a close eye on Sparkles constant songwriting in her notepad; more than in the original one feels that she is driven to create and express herself even if shes never dared think of herself as a born performer. Given the robust vocalizing by Sparks who burst on the scene as the winner of American Idol in 2006 there could scarcely have been any doubt. The familys roots in gospel and church life are amply displayed as is Houstons own deep connection to the form in a powerful climactic number ""Celebrate"" that serves as her cinematic musical swan song. The musical choices overseen by executive music consultant R. Kelly are eclectic ranging from sultry and/or soulful originals (some of which Kelly wrote) to vintage standards (Sarah Vaughan Aretha Franklin Sly and the Family Stone) and even some white pop (Cream Nancy Sinatra) that Sparkle likes to watch on TV. Where Sparkle scants is in credible period evocation. Theres a mention of riots in Detroit and a glimpse of Martin Luther King Jr. on the tube but no sense that either means more to these characters than they would have to white teenagers in Portland. Nor is Dr. Kings death even noted though it took place in the year depicted. Despite having been shot in Michigan very little specific atmosphere is imparted. Many of the sets look far too modern just as the dialogue is studded with usages that were in some cases decades away. PHOTOS Whitney Houston Funeral Fans and Loved Ones Honor the Legendary Star But the interplay among the characters pulsates and the dramatic confrontations are sufficiently charged for the audience to get past the rampant aspirational cliches or at least ride with them. In whats mostly the womens film Epps does a first-rate job as the oily seductor while Luke manages credibly despite his characters goody-goody demeanor.

"Sparkle | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Review Sparkle Andrew Barker Senior Features Writer barkerrant 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr August 16 2012 | 1200PM PT Interest in Whitney Houstons swan song should all but ensure decent business for this hopelessly scattered remake. As a remake of a cult 70s musical developed as a star vehicle for a former ""American Idol"" winner ""Sparkle"" would seem to have all the makings of a low-rent ""Dreamgirls"" perfectly serviceable if sometimes hopelessly scattered. Or at least it would have been that vehicle were it not saddled with the unfortunate significance of featuring Whitney Houstons final performance having wrapped mere months before her sudden death in February. A film with foundations this slight cant help but crumble under such a burden although its precisely the interest in Houstons swan song that should all but ensure decent business. The 1976 original which featured music from Curtis Mayfield and a script by a young Joel Schumacher focused on a trio of sibling singers in 1950s Harlem stitching together a zany patchwork of great music overheated melodrama and risible social commentary. Director Salim Akils remake tones down its predecessors incipient weirdness and relocates the action to late-60s Detroit where mousy young church singer Sparkle (Jordin Sparks) is eager to break into the soul scene exploding all around her. An ""Idol"" alum whose career has been idling for the past few years Sparks should see a healthy Q-rating bump from her first starring role here; shes cute as a button and can belt with the best of em even if her range of expression is mostly limited to the extremes of either ecstatic well-being or lip-quivering sadness. Shes certainly likable enough and its not her fault that she frequently disappears from view in her own movie. Sparks is tasked with playing the wallflower in a family full of forceful personalities which does the inexperienced thesp no favors. Her wild-child older sister Sister (Carmen Ejogo) is a sort of Motor City Ishtar a tsunami of melisma swiveling hips sex drugs and violence. Her other sister Dolores (Tika Sumpter) is a proto-Black Power firebrand who takes on potential record-industry grifters like a 60s Wendy Day. And Houston plays the familys iron-fisted churchgoing matriarch Emma whose own rough experiences with the music business and men cause her to deny both to her progeny. What Sparkle does have is a knack for songwriting. Surreptitiously penning songs for Sister to perform at sweaty clubs Sparkle catches the eye of fellow church member Stix (Derek Luke) whose romantic intentions dovetail conveniently with his dreams of becoming the next Berry Gordy. Assembling the sisters into a Supremes-style trio Stix somehow navigates them to a spot opening for Aretha Franklin before their mother has even begun to wonder where theyve been every night. Meanwhile Sister has traded the affections of a sweet local boy (Omari Hardwick) for conk-haired diamond-flashing local celebrity Satin (Mike Epps) a slithering viper who sets about destroying all familial harmony. ""Sparkle"" deals in such well-worn rise-and-fall music-bio tropes that its hard to blame it for simply coasting on narrative shorthand at times. But the lackadaisical storytelling can inch toward outright laziness with a number of key plot points elided from view while whole scenes are wasted on foreshadowing character developments that never actually develop. Of course all eyes are bound to be on Houston here and her performance registers as a success in its mere normalcy She looks her age and no more delivers her lines crisply and has adequate chemistry with her co-stars. Aside from one gasp-inducing line -- ""Is my life not enough of a cautionary tale for you?"" -- ghoulish gossipmongers eager to scour the screen for hints of her own personal troubles will thankfully leave the theater empty-handed. For her one onscreen number Houston performs the century-old gospel standard ""His Eye Is on the Sparrow"" and its a bit of an odd one. Backed by a seasick piano and a choir arrangement that never quite taps into the rhythm of the song Houston sounds a tad hoarse and uncharacteristically sticks to the lower end of her range. But given the funereal mood of the scene in which the song appears it cant help but be affecting. Ejogo seems to be channeling Beyonces interpretation of Diana Ross more than the genuine article though she puts in a solid shift all the same as does the ever-reliable Luke. The best performance comes from comedian Epps Evoking a strange crossbreed of Morris Day and Patrick Bateman his Satin manages to be genuinely chilling in his dead-eyed sociopathology while still earning the films biggest laughs. R. Kelly serves as executive music consultant here producing tasteful covers of several Mayfield tunes and penning a few new ones himself. Much like his own retro projects ""Love Letter"" and ""Write Me Back"" Kellys contributions mingle the compositional framework of 60s Ramp;B with the quiet-storm smoothness of the 1980s producing some climactic numbers that sound right yet feel inescapably off. Akim directs with professional flair during the music sequences journeyman adequacy during the domestic scenes and amateur shoddiness during his few overreaching attempts at auteurial flourishes. Editing is a bit ragged though most other tech specs are pro.

Most remakes force you to ask why anyone bothered. Theyre either so faithful or so much worse than what inspired them that the only way to watch the new version is cynically. ""Sparkle"" is a remake of a girl-group drama from 1976 and its obviously been made by people who saw the original and thought ""What on earth was that?"" Its a better movie than whats inspired it but that fails to explain much. Its like preferring the line at the concession stand to the one for the bathroom.The first movie jammed black politics black feminism mother-daughter relations domestic violence and the alleged story of the Supremes into a blender. The result was a grim raggedy-looking 98 minutes directed by Sam OSteen co-written by Joel Schumacher and set to new music by Curtis Mayfield who at the time was near the height of both his ingenuity and his multitasking.You never really knew why you were supposed to care about the heroine Sparkle who was played by Irene Cara. Some of this had to do with the fact that you often couldnt see her. ""Sparkle"" remains one of the most flagrant examples of what happens when Hollywood is desperate to showcase black people without first figuring out how to properly light them. Calling such a dark movie ""Sparkle"" still feels like an accidental show of contempt. (OSteen was white but its not just white filmmakers who are guilty of this. It took Tyler Perry at least four movies to find a way to light his cast as Streisandly as he lights himself.)In any case Sparkle and her two sisters find themselves caught up with scrumptious Harlem men -- Philip Michael Thomas and Dorian Harewood -- who hustle the trio into the music business. Things turn ugly. One sister dies the other disappears another is forced to triumph. If it was truly the story of the Supremes it was the Supremes by way of Agnes Nixon and Iceberg Slim. When the movies over youre at a loss for two reasons -- well there are more than two but only two are worth going into here. The first is that Mayfields luscious arrangements make no sense in the movies late 1950s-early 1960s setting. The other is that the most charismatic of the girls takes the movie with her when she leaves. Lonette McKee played Sister and shes such a natural astonishment that its insulting that the movie would carry on without her.The remake corrects nearly all of this. For starters its been situated in late-60s early-1970s Detroit which allows the filmmakers to impose upon the story the political and pop-cultural moment (Martin Luther King and Aretha Franklins names are dropped somebody gets an Afro a nightclub plays ""Sing a Simple Song""). The new context allows Mayfields songs which have had their lusciousness removed (who corrects Curtis Mayfield?) sound a tad more apt. Salim Akil directed ""Sparkle"" from a script credited to his wife Mara Brock Akil and Howard Rosenman who co-wrote the original script and by the second half its a different movie. Its ""Dreamgirls."" Technically Akils is the better movie than OSteens. You can see the actors faces and the crew knows how to light every hue of brown skin. But theres little in this new version as strange druggy sad doomed and vividly carnal as Lonette McKees performance. The English actress Carmen Ejogo is Sister now and part of the trouble with this film is that you still dont know what its about. McKee gave it psychology and humanness. Every emotion was utterly natural transparent. There was no technique. Every time Ejogo swings her hips or goes on a bender technique is all you feel. This woman is acting And shes doing so in a different movie.The rest of ""Sparkle"" is speakers day stuff in which our putative star whos now played by Jordin Sparks Follows Her Dreams and Stands Up for Herself and Gets What She Wants. Her ascent from pretty church mouse to Alicia Keys doing Carole King is less than convincing. But in the same way Ejogo whos fair-skinned and does lots of performing with her hair seems meant to remind you more of Beyonce than Diana Ross Sparkss casting seems meant to give the movie some contemporariness. Sparks won ""American Idol"" five years ago. Maybe the movie is about that.Ha ha ha.""Sparkle"" isnt about Jordin Sparks or Carmen Ejogo especially when either of them sings. ""Sparkle"" is about its actual star the woman most people wholl line up for this movie will have come to see. Its about Whitney Houston who died in February plays the girls churchy overbearing mother and dominates the movie without working half as hard as Derek Luke Mike Epps Omari Hardwick or the wonderful Tika Sumpter who plays the other other sister.Houston didnt make many films -- this was only her fourth -- and she wasnt a natural actor.She spoke too fast emoted too little and seemed intimidated by the demands of being larger than life when she couldnt rely on her voice. This is the first time her singing feels like an afterthought. With her in this part as a woman who once lived hard and is trying to prevent her daughters from being chewed up and spit out by the music business Houston embodies powerful cautionary wisdom.In her fuller carriage and in the cadences of the rasp her voice had acquired you can see and hear a life lived. We didnt need to see her perform in ""Sparkle."" She walks and sits in this movie like a woman whos already sung. Yet once Houston stands at the front of a church and mellifluously wraps that rasp around ""His Eye Is on the Sparrow"" the movie is effectively over. The camera frames her looking heavenward and hopping up and down. What were seeing is something holy. This woman is singing to us and to God. Shes also singing to herself.

Share Tweet The original 1976 version of Sparkle transposed some older-than-vaudeville show-business cliches to the music world of the late 50s and early 60s in service of a story about three sisters trying to make it as a girl group while bumping up against crime abuse and drug addiction. The script co-written by Howard Rosenman and Joel Schumacher left no familiar peril unexplored but it was elevated by its vivid depiction of the New York music scene plus a bunch of terrific songs written by Curtis Mayfield and performed on its bestselling soundtrack album by Aretha Franklin. Though the 2012 remake directed by Salim Akil dials back some of the more sensationalistic elements it doesnt otherwise do much to improve on the source material. Moving the action to Detroit and the calendar up to 1968 a smart setting that catches soul music at a crossroads it features impressive period detail and some terrific music adding a handful of new R. Kelly songs to the Mayfield numbers. But the stuff that takes place between music numbers in that lovingly realized recreation of late-60s Detroit hasnt defrosted too well. It does look good though. Akil--working from a script by his wife Marak Brock Akil--favors a rich lush look that pays off well in a handful of scenes as in a trip to a record store that moves slowly past a row of listening booths filled with music fans looking rapt in their own private worlds. If nothing else the film knows how to show the transportive power of music. Talking about it is another matter though. Sparkle opens promisingly with a performance by Cee Lo Green who plays an amateur-night legend about to get knocked off his modest pedestal by a pair of sisters Carmen Ejogo and as the title character Jordin Sparks. Sparks plays a talented singer and songwriter who lacks the confidence to come out from behind the shadow of her showier independent sister a dynamic established in the first scene when they explain to each another the roles they play in each others lives as if meeting for the first time. It never gets any subtler from there as the film explores their relationship with their overbearing mother (Whitney Houston) a failed singer who uses piety as an excuse to shield her children from the world. This is Houstons last film and her performance embodies everything right and wrong about Sparkle Its a monochrome collection of overprotective mom gestures but suggests a rainbow of human complexity in a superfluous show-stopping musical performance. Almost as an afterthought the film throws in a third sister (Tika Sumpter) who joins the act to pay for medical school. With the help of an ambitious young music promoter (Derek Luke) with eyes for Sparks they inch their way up through the Detroit clubs. But with success come setbacks. Ejogo captures the attention of a self-loathing comedian played by Mike Epps. Tortured by having won a white following by telling degrading jokes about African-Americans he numbs himself with cocaine then starts to take his frustration out on Ejogo jeopardizing her safety and the acts future. Its the most pronounced of the films several unapologetically melodramatic turns all of which would be fine if it found ways to pull at the heart. The film spends so little time developing its characters apart from all that expository dialogue that its like asking audiences to care for paper dolls. And Sparkle never delivers on the promise of its most famous song by giving viewers something they can feel. Its also problematic as a showcase for Sparks. She has an appealing presence and an open expressive face but by design the film keeps her passive and out of the spotlight until the finale. When the time comes however she delivers musically in a big way so much so that it might have been better to craft a movie around her talents rather than dropping her in this creaky old thing.

Salim Akils remake scripted by his wife Mara Brock Akil (creator of the late great Girlfriends and The Game) moves the action to Detroit 1968. With this relo the production design has been expanded considerably as has the plot and dialogue; the forebears underwritten melodrama has been supplanted by Tyler Perry-like soap operatics and much jawing about the Lord riots in the Motor City marriage proposals and maternal heartbreak and disapproval. Sparkle 2.0 wisely retains most of the 76 versions Curtis Mayfield-composed songs and the new numbers by R. Kelly fit nicely with those outstanding tracks. But where the original singing threesome--siblings who went onstage as ""Sister and the Sisters""--generated intense heat from the fiery foxy Lonette McKee the redo suffers from the weak screen presences of Carmen Ejogo as the troupes lead singer who gets hooked on dope and bad love and American Idol winner Jordin Sparks in the title role (originated by Irene Cara) who goes solo after Sister self-destructs. But one casting choice was perfect Immediately after the Akils Sparkle becomes most ridiculous the film cuts to Whitney Houston as the trios stern Bible-brandishing mother singing ""His Eye Is on the Sparrow."" The moment is not as sublime as Mahalia Jacksons ""Trouble of the World"" in Douglas Sirks Imitation of Life but its close enough.

It has all of Perrys signature touches soapy situations ripe dialogue and some Sunday-morning sermonizing to give the whole thing a vaguely spiritual quality. Sparkle Fair to good Director Salim Akil. Cast Jordin Sparks Carmen Ejogo Mike Epps Whitney Houston Derek Luke. Rating Rated PG-13 for thematic content violence language and smoking. Fortunately the mix recalls the filmmaker on one of his good days. ""Sparkle"" is pure melodrama but its a high-powered well-acted entertaining melodrama. You may not always believe it but you wont be bored. Jordin Sparks makes film debut | Sparkle fitting finale for Whitney Houston A remake of a 1976 musical drama that boasted a pre-""Fame"" Irene Cara as the title character the new ""Sparkle"" arrives with Jordin Sparks in the lead. In her film debut its a little hard to gauge how good an actress Sparks is. She smiles radiantly looks spectacular and sings like a dream but the part doesnt require her to express much more than quiet determination. It will be interesting to see her stretch in future projects. Sparkle is one of a trio of Detroit sisters in the 1960s who form a singing group that begins to rise to fame. The characters fit nicely into tidy little compartments. Sparkle is a shy songwriter; Delores (Tika Sumpter) is brainy and defiant; and Sister (Carmen Ejogo) is self-destructive and sexy. In the original the dynamically written character of Sister pretty much steals the show from the meek Sparkle. The same thing happens here Sparks plays demure while Ejogo struts around like sex on a stick. Prediction If the movie is a hit Ejogo will emerge as a star. The gorgeous Ejogo purrs coos and gets the meatiest story line as Sister spirals into drug abuse and deals with an explosive boyfriend Satin. A coked-up Sister also gets to say the movies most delicious line ""Sister cant fly on one wing"" a bit lifted from the original film that will have fans of camp rejoicing. Although Ejogo is wonderful Mike Epps delivers the movies most revelatory turn as the despicable Satin. Satin is a stand-up comic who makes his living playing for White folks in posh nightclubs. Hes a charmer whos constantly on the verge of violence. With its electric mix of humor and danger Epps edgy performance recalls Joe Pesci at his peak. Epps is always a welcome presence but he never has displayed this range before. Whitney Houston served as executive producer and stars as Emma the siblings mother whose dream of a singing career never materialized. Shes fine in an understated role; her world-weary vocal on ""His Eye Is on the Sparrow"" is one of the movies highlights. Salim Akils direction keeps everything moving at a fast pace. He has a kinetic style that works well on musical sequences and the film is filled with little atmospheric touches. A lovely sequence in a record store in which the camera drifts to different listening booths boasts a dreamlike quality that illustrates Akils affinity for the material. Despite the movies charms theres one nagging problem It feels as if it is named after the wrong character. Its wildly lopsided. Theres a reason after all that the J.K. Rowling series of books wasnt named after Ron Weasley. Reach the reporter at randy.cordovaarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849. Twitter.com/randy_cordova.

They go by the name ""Sister and the Sisters"" not quite as jazzy as The Supremes but with a ring to it. They have ample talent and Sister (Carmen Ejogo) could shimmy her way to fame in a heartbeat but a treacherous man (Mike Epps) leads her astray. His name is Satin--like Sparkle a name you might expect to find on a product under your sink--and this silky but dangerous creature feeds poor Sister drugs beats her and interferes with the trios grand ambitions. From the get-go nobody except Sister likes Satin; the girls mother Emma (the late Whitney Houston) loathes him on sight. This years Sparkle like the original (which had the distinction of being written by famed Hollywood player Joel Schumacher when he was a wee thing of 37) is about corruption the price of physical beauty and triumph against the odds all stories as old as the hills. Older even than Dreamgirls which it has much in common with starting with the setting. The old Sparkle took place in Harlem in 1958 this one is in Detroit in 1968. Theyre very different worlds Motown dangling tantalizingly in front of Sparkle and her sisters in the remake while in Harlem 10 years earlier things were more casual. When things didnt work out with music cast members departed for the Civil Rights movement or construction jobs ""upstate"" paying the princely sum of 5 to 10 an hour. Everyone in this Sparkle has more money and better jobs. Epps Satin is a comedian who caters to white audiences a self-described ""Sambo"" while the original Satin only had the imagination to be a mobster. Sparkle herself is not just a singer but a prolific songwriter who the third sister says ""could be the next Smokey Robinson."" (I should use her name Dolores since I liked her and Tika Sumpter the actress playing her but as the ""plain"" sister least enchanted with the spotlight Dolores exists to get the narrative shaft.) (READ TIMEs appreciation of Whitney Houston) I could go on at length about how the original is more desperate darker and more impressionistic than this slick new version but lets get down to business The biggest distinction between the two films is that the 2012 Sparkle is a cinematic pallbearer arriving with the burden of Whitney Houstons drug-related death on its not-intended-to-be-mighty shoulders. Sparkle is Houstons last film and her first feature film since 1996s The Preachers Wife. Before she died in February at 48 Sparkle was being billed as her comeback. Honestly it could have been Houstons voice is rough and raspy but she is undeniably there in Sparkle a funny convincing presence seemingly reveling in the chance to act. From how much she gives to the performance you would not suspect drugs would take her within months. (SEE Whitney Houston her life in pictures) As it stands the tragedy touching the characters--softened from the 1976 film director Salim Akils (Jumping the Broom) remake swaps one death for one much less heartbreaking--has less impact than the real-life tragedy. The movie was screened for critics a scant 36 hours before its release which generally suggests a level of insecurity about the product. But Sparkle while occasionally silly in a way that made a preview audience titter is decent entertainment. (Although Mr. Akil avoid slow motion in the future at all costs and hire a better makeup artist for bruising and cuts.) It has nice bursts of comedy some nifty musical numbers and an appealing cast. Derek Luke playing Stix the role originated by Philip Michael Thomas before his Miami Vice days is adorable as usual. Ejogo is an Angelina Jolie type all perfect lips cat eyes and snake hips a rival for the original Sister the dazzling Lonette McKee. And Sparks gives an truly poised performance especially considering she like her fellow American Idol alum Jennifer Hudson in Dreamgirls is a novice making her feature film debut. (READ James Poniewozik on the mysterious power of American Idol) So why screen Sparkle so late? Maybe because some of Houstons dialogue as Emma cuts so eerily close to reality that the studio wasnt quite sure what kind of response to expect. Emma is a devout churchgoer who doesnt even let her younger daughters date but she had a wild substance abusing past that included an attempt to make it in the music business herself. It hangs over them all. ""Was my life not enough of a cautionary tale for you?"" she demands of her daughters. During a fight Sister reminds her mother of the times she was ""laid up in your own vomit"" leaving the youthful Sister in charge of  Dolores and Sparkle. My mind flashed to a bleak paparazzi photo of Houston just before she died out at some party looking dazed her bare legs flecked with something that bloggers speculated was vomit. But while Sparkle can bring on images like that thats the viewers baggage. I tried to focus instead on watching Houston genuinely enjoying the role. She was never Meryl Streep but she was after all a great performer. Her many fans will likely cherish Sparkle if only because it gives them a last opportunity to see her sing. In terms of narrative the song is oddly wedged in an obvious showcase or perhaps exploitation. Its a church hymn ""His Eye Is on the Sparrow"" and shes obviously not at her prime but man oh man the power of even that faded glory. What a shame. READ TIMEs review of the original Sparkle.

(Alicia Gbur) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday August 16 2012 1253 PM Title Sparkle Film Info With Jordin Sparks Whitney Houston. Musical sisters aim to become Motown legends. Director Salim Akil (156). PG-13 Drugs violence sexuality. Area theaters. Despite its festive title Salim Akils ""Sparkle"" comes to theaters shaded by sadness. We all know that this represents the last performance from Whitney Houston who died three months after filming her role. Theres no denying that the pictures off-screen history gives it an import it would otherwise lack. But a strong cast empathetic direction and memorable soundtrack help create a movie that does everyone proud. Houston plays Emma the stern church-going single mother to three singing sisters in 1968 Detroit (the period details are excellent). ""American Idol"" winner Jordin Sparks is Sparkle the youngest and most innocent; Tika Sumpter is Dee the cynic and Carmen Ejogo is Sister the rebellious beauty. Sparkle writes the songs so Sister can become the next Diana Ross. They need a Berry Gordy too and he comes in the form of Stix (Derek Luke) Sparkles ambitious boyfriend. While Emma has lived long enough to understand the empty promises of the music business her daughters ignore her warnings sneaking out for club gigs whenever possible. Its only a matter of time before Sister catches the eye of a slick local celebrity TV comic Satin (Mike Epps). But as long as hes around the girls rise is likely to be followed by a hard fall. Sister Williams (Carmen Ejogo) and Sparkle (Jordin Sparks). (Alicia Gbur) We have of course heard this story many times before. The dialogues a little corny and the drama is unabashedly soapy. Still the actors sell it all. We believe in the bond between these women we root for their success we hurt when they fail. Naturally much of that emotional connection is inspired by Houston. Her voice appears strained and she does not look strong but she offers touching work as a tenderly tough matriarch. (The filmmakers should however have been kind enough to excise unnecessarily explicit lines about her characters prior substance addiction.) Dont be surprised if the audience in your theater bursts into spontaneous applause after her church solo of ""His Eye Is on the Sparrow"" as happened in mine. Really the film is meant to be a showcase for Sparks. But while she is a sweet presence she isnt a natural actress. She lacks the vulnerability of Irene Cara the original Sparkle and doesnt seem fully comfortable until the soaring finale when shes allowed to tap into her true gift her voice. Ejogo is the real heartbreaker as Sister adding affecting delicacy to a role that could so easily have become an overblown cliche. Shes been working solidly for years and will soon be seen as Tyler Perrys wife in ""Alex Cross."" But she deserves more than supporting roles. It would be only fitting if this film helped make her the leading lady she ought to be. Both onscreen and off ""Sparkle"" is a story about beginnings and endings. Akil who also made the appealing ""Jumping the Broom"" understands the poignancy of these themes. So come to see Sparks pay tribute to Houston and celebrate the star-making performance that Ejogo delivers.

"Review Sparkle - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Sparkle In Houstons swan song a pleasing debut for Sparks August 16 2012|Michael Phillips | Movie criticJordin Sparks and Whitney Houston star in ""Sparkle.""Warmly remembered corn featuring some fantastic performers including Lonette McKee and Mary Alice the first ""Sparkle"" (1976) starred Irene Cara as a mousy but learning-to-roar 15-year-old -- one third of a late 50s sister act led by the hard-living smolderer played by McKee whose character grappled with drug abuse contended with an abusive boyfriend and battled relentless cliches in a heartbreak-and-triumph fairy tale whipped up by screenwriter Joel Schumacher. This was before the Broadway musical ""Dreamgirls"" pumped up similar material for its own purposes.Now comes the ""Sparkle"" remake and you know what? It works. The director is Salim Akil whose ensemble comedy ""Jump the Broom"" likewise paced itself with ease and authority and showed similar wiles in the way of cliche refurbishment. Most of the stuff thats new in the new ""Sparkle"" written by Mara Brock Akil (who is married to the director) is shrewd and cleverly considered. The stuff thats old is what people responded to back in 76.The action steered more toward a faith-based community than the original has been moved forward a decade and located in Detroit (though you rarely get a sense of a city on fire in 1968). Sparkle played by ""American Idol"" champeen Jordin Sparks has been activated in story terms so that shes not simply waiting around for things to happen to her and around her.The new ""Sparkle"" writes her own material which she must hide from her formidable God-fearing mother played by Whitney Houston. This is Houstons farewell; she died in February of this year after completing filming. The character of the mother is meant to be a heartbroken vocalist wannabe who chased her dreams of glory when she was younger but ran into bad luck and worse men. At one point in ""Sparkle"" one of her daughters confronts her about finding her some nights ""laid up in your own vomit."" The line stings and though Houstons character refutes it clearly its a link to Houstons own tabloid fodder image. In the film Houston sings ""His Eye is On the Sparrow"" at an appropriately melodramatic point in the story. Its a fitting reminder of why Houston whose voice was coarse-grained but still powerful at the time of filming became a sensation in the first place.How has ""Sparkle"" the showbiz myth changed since 76? No longer are there lines of dialogue such as the daughter lecturing her mother ""We dont have to be slaves to the white establishment anymore"" Mother was a maid in the original; in the remake shes a prosperous retail employee and active woman of the church living well but sternly until she learns to loosen up and let the offspring find themselves. Its absurd how long the daughters are able to keep their rising fame and sneaking-out-at-night a secret from their protector. But we dont enjoy films like ""Sparkle"" for their documentary realism.I appreciate how director Akil allows even the heinous characters such as Mike Epps self-hating comedian a moment of insight or revelation amid the story basics. Theres a well-written dinner-table scene wherein Sister (Carmen Ejogo) brings the Crisco-slick comedian home to meet her family. They smell a rat but Epps knows just how to play him without tipping his hand too early or too often about the brutalities to come.Sparks as Sparkle has a warm and pleasing screen quality. Shes a tad bland but so is the character as written. Shes meant to blow everybody away in the finale but heres another thing about ""Sparkle"" It actually holds back in terms of technique and dramatic builds. That restraint may hinder it at the box office but director Akil knows how to give his actors space and time to get a few things going on their own. Also theres a great simple tracking shot along a line of listening booths at a Detroit record store and if youre old enough to remember those days you may find that shot as moving as anything Houston or Sparks manages in this entertaining remix.mjphillipstribune.comSparkle -- 3 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for mature thematic content involving domestic abuse and drug material and for some violence language and smoking)Running time 151Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesLawless rules with violence ...

(AP Photo/TriStar Pictures - Sony Alicia Gbur) Alicia Gbur This undated film image released by TriStar Pictures shows Jordin Sparks in a scene from ""Sparkle."" (AP Photo/TriStar Pictures - Sony Alicia Gbur) The 1976 film ""Sparkle"" a Supremes-inspired bit of black cinema starring Irene Cara is remembered fondly by African-American audiences some of whom may have created false yet warming memories of how good the movie really was.The cult classic boasted a strong performance by Lonette McKee and one of the best movie soundtracks youll find thanks to Curtis Mayfield and Aretha Franklin. Otherwise it was cheesy poorly lit and unremarkable.One thing the movie needed was a real spit-shine and ""Sparkle"" gets just that in a remake starring ""American Idol"" winner Jordin Sparks and Whitney Houston in her final movie role. Itll be difficult for some original ""Sparkle"" enthusiasts to even consider a new take. But this version improves on the original in nearly every way except the music -- obviously key in a music-based story.But how do you top Franklin and Mayfield? You dont.The entertainingly melodramatic ""Sparkle"" directed by Salim Akil moves the 1960s action from Harlem to Detroit where budding music trio Sister amp; Her Sisters is coming up through the music scene.Theres sweet sister Sparkle (Sparks) sexy sister Sister (Carmen Ejogo) and brainy sister Delores (Tika Sumpter) who regularly sneak out of the house to sing at local nightclubs after disapproving Mama Emma (Houston) falls asleep. Emma once tried making it as a singer and it almost ruined her.The confident Sister fronts the group singing songs written by Sparkle who yearns to be a star but lacks the nerve to step out in front.Stix (Derek Luke) who calls himself the next Berry Gordy latches onto the women and has eyes for Sparkle. Sister has two sets of eyes on her nice-guy Levi (Omari Hardwick) and flashy but hateful Satin (Mike Epps) a comedian who abuses Sister and gets her hooked on drugs tearing the group apart.What happens is tragic and its also a major plot change that fans of the original will either love or hate. Sparks in her big-screen debut is a comforting presence as a star waiting to be born and not too much is demanded of her. The heavy lifting is left to Ejogo in a role that should make her a star and Epps who perfectly plays his smarmy character with relish.And what of Houston in her final role in a casting choice that drew bittersweet ""Sparkle"" headlines after her death? The legendary singer handles her smallish maternal role expertly though her singing contributions are less than stellar. Theres no trace that she wouldnt live to see the movie open so dont bother looking. But when when Houstons character utters ""was my life not enough of a cautionary tale for you?"" viewers are lifted right out of the movie and into Houstons own tragic tale. A line about her character lying in vomit has the same impact.Director Akil employs some great stylistic touches throughout and knows how to stage a great if tumultuous dinner scene.""Sparkle"" will draw immediate though unfair comparisons to ""Dreamgirls"" which made it to the big screen first. But its worth noting the source material the original ""Sparkle"" was released five years before ""Dreamgirls"" hit Broadway.Energetic colorful and packed with strong performances and musical numbers good enough to get by ""Sparkle"" beams brightly.SPARKLEThree and a half stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 156  Content Mature thematic content involving domestic abuse and drug material and some violence language and smoking Kevin C.
