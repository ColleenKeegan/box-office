Ken Woroner/Sidney Kimmel Entertainment hide caption toggle caption Ken Woroner/Sidney Kimmel Entertainment Susan Gardner (Kat Dennings) and Charlie Bartlett (Anton Yelchin) share a moment at the piano in Bartletts upscale home in Charlie Bartlett. Ken Woroner/Sidney Kimmel Entertainment Charlie Bartlett is a sweet smart very privileged kid who has been kicked out of every private academy his over-medicated mom has sent him to. Now hes about to start at a public school and he knows theres a decent chance he wont fit in there either. Except that Charlie has internalized the language of psychiatry Hes been in analysis most of his life his mother is what you might call pharmaceutically relaxed and his family keeps an analyst more or less on-call. And while that didnt set Charlie apart in prep school it gives him some advantages in public school. With a little anger-management counseling he has soon tamed the school bully. And when the other kids notice that they start lining up to have him counsel them too -- in a makeshift office he sets up in a school restroom. Charlie sits in one stall his ""patients"" in the next. Charlie doesnt just offer common-sense advice; he also does unto his classmates as his shrinks have been doing unto him becoming the schools unofficial psycho-pharmacologist dispensing prescription antidepressants that he and his mom dont need. At which point of course hes an outcast no longer. Being an outcast has been a popular problem in teen movies since those Ferris Buellers Sixteen Breakfast flicks John Hughes made back in the 1980s. And first-time director Jon Poll seems to have found his inner Hughes while working with a 21st-century cast Anton Yelchin downright charismatic as Charlie; Kat Dennings smart and snarky as his girlfriend Susan; and in a casting coup Robert Downey Jr. -- the ultimate teen bad-boy back in the 80s -- still volatile as Charlies grown-up nemesis. All of which makes for a picture thats breezy and sitcom light aimed at teens despite its R rating and accented with a few grace notes that will appeal to an older crowd. A melody runs through the film for instance that I couldnt place until it was finally given lyrics at school assembly. Its ""If You Want to Sing Out"" the theme from that earlier teen-outcast movie Harold and Maude. Sweet-natured like its hero Charlie Bartlett isnt nearly as edgy or as unpredictable as that picture but the rules have changed since then. And Charlie Bartlett is as sweetly subversive as any teen comedy to come along since Ferris skipped school.

This wise and beautiful little film is about two lovers falling from a state of grace. Watch a clip of Paramounts ""Like Crazy."" The outward impediment to their romance is a bureaucratic tangle. Anna (Felicity Jones) a vivacious young Englishwoman in her senior year at a California college falls in love with Jacob (Anton Yelchin) a touchingly tender young American whos been studying furniture design. After graduation she overstays her student visa by a couple of months to spend the summer with him. After a quick trip home to visit her parents Anna returns to California where U.S. immigration officials discover her visa violation refuse her entry and put her on the next flight back to London. At a time when illegal immigration is a hot-button topic Annas troubles might seem trivial. But her offense and the complicated long-distance relationship that ensues are only pretexts for a heartbreaking study of passionate love that deprived of proximity turn into confusion little lies on both sides then bigger lies and worst of all self-betrayal. ENLARGE Anton Yelchin and Felicity Jones in Like Crazy. Paramount Vantage ""Like Crazy"" was directed by Drake Doremus who wrote the script with Ben York Jones. Yet the written words arent necessarily the ones that come out of the actors mouths since most of the dialogue was improvised. I didnt realize that going in. I try to know as little as possible about a given film in advance of seeing it and this one undercut my conviction that actors improvisations lead more often than not to spontaneous banality. (My assumption about John Guleserians beautiful cinematography was similarly upset. I would have bet that hed shot on 35mm film. In fact he used the video function of a Canon EOS 7D a digital still camera that sells on the consumer market for about 1500 plus lenses and often travels on vacationers necks.) Ms. Jones and Mr. Yelchin are spontaneous all right. So too are Jennifer Lawrence as Jacobs fallback girlfriend (though I wish shed had a more substantial role) and Alex Kingston and Oliver Muirhead as Annas parents. But Anna and Jacob are also eloquent in their respective ways--Ms. Jones with her very English verbal fluency Mr. Yelchin with his very American syntactic vagueness--and all the more so in the silence of their expressions. Seldom has a script found such resonance in its lovers eyes body language and inward gazes. At one point in their relationship with Anna stuck in England while the U.S. Embassy reviews her case Jacob gives her a silver bracelet engraved with one word Patience. The same advice applies to moviegoers. ""Like Crazy"" develops slowly and threatens at first to be just another movie about beautiful young people in the Age of Fraught Relationships. Its much more than that though. Without belaboring any issues it speaks volumes about fear of commitment--Annas father offers the cheerfully old-fashioned suggestion that she and Jacob solve her visa problem by getting married--about inconstancy in any age about anxiety bred of mendacity about the dangers as well as the pleasures of impulsivity and the mystery of what if anything a pledge of love means. Patience pays off at least for us. Watch a film clip of director Chris Millers new animation movie ""Puss in Boots"" starring Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek. Clip Courtesy of DreamWorks. Puss in Boots Dont think of this charming 3-D animated feature as a spin-off from ""Shrek"" so much as a lift-off for the swashbuckling feline voiced by Antonio Banderas. Puss made his debut in ""Shrek 2"" then did time in the two decreasingly funny sequels. Now hes got a movie of his own and not a moment too soon. ""Puss in Boots"" exults in extravagant images while Mr. Banderas makes its hero--""Poos"" as his name is pronounced by most of the Spanish-accented characters--a paragon of sophisticated wit. You cant help but smile at his first Zorro-esque line accompanied by a guitar strum ""Through the years I have been known by many names."" And you sense a bright comic imagination at work when he bellies up to a bar orders milk and purrs ""I am but a humble gato looking for his next meal."" ENLARGE The titular feline swashbuckler in Puss in Boots. DreamWorks Animation A dramatic imagination is another story. The plot is little more than a string of collisions and events with a Tom-and-Jerry flavor that gets seriously diluted over the course of 90 minutes. Puss teams up with Humpty Dumpty (a creepily epicene ovoid voiced with eerie plaintiveness by Zach Galifianakis) to repay an old debt by stealing some magic beans from Jack and Jill. Along the way they climb a beanstalk that looks like a sky-scraping strand of DNA encounter a baby goose noticeably smaller than the golden eggs it lays a mother goose with the dimensions and disposition of King Kong and Kitty Softpaws a sexy cat burglar--that is to say a cat who burgles preferably by picking pockets-- played by Salma Hayek. When Puss and Kitty meet they throw themselves into a showstopper of a flamenco dance fight and do an equally effective reprise awhile later. But it isnt quite correct to say they stop the show which constantly functions in fits and starts--appealing set pieces inspired displays of animation (almost too much of too many brilliant things) and above all a performance by Mr. Banderas that defines the essence of droll. His voice is the gatos meow. Anonymous Watch a clip of Roland Emmerichs political thriller ""Anonymous"". Video courtesy of Sony/Columbia. Roland Emmerich has all but ended the world in such action spectaculars as ""Independence Day"" ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and ""2012."" In ""Anonymous"" he extinguishes literary scholarship by contending that Shakespeares plays were written by Edward de Vere Earl of Oxford. So all right then thats taken care of. Edward (played by Rhys Ifans) is the man we should have been honoring all along and Will Shakespeare an amiable buffoon as well as an indifferent actor took credit where it wasnt due. One problem with ""Anonymous"" though is what it says about the writers trade. Shakespeare--I mean Edward--is an unhappy man. ""The voices"" he cries. ""I cant stop them I would go mad if I didnt write down the voices."" He gets no sympathy from his wife. ""My God"" she says with disgust ""youre writing again."" And toward the end of his life he muses glumly ""Words merely words will be my sole legacy."" Didnt he even have fun writing his comedies? ENLARGE Rhys Ifans in Anonymous. Columbia Pictures A bigger problem with ""Anonymous"" is its opacity. The nonsensical notion of Edwards authorship is hardly more than a subplot. (He decided to hide it according to John Orloffs screenplay--which was actually written by whom?--out of fear that his plays were dangerously critical of powerful figures in Queen Elizabeths court.) Most of the movie is devoted to the Essex Rebellion against the queen and the action hops back and forth in time so befuddlingly with the same set of characters played by different actors that I defy anyone who isnt a scholar of the period to understand whats going on. (Which is not to suggest that I did.) Joely Richardson is engaging as the young queen but her mother Vanessa Redgrave is something else as Queen Bess in her powdered dotage. That something varies from moment to moment scene to scene. Sometimes shes distracted to the point of dottiness sometimes shes sharp as a tack and still seductive. In a movie that rings false at every turn Ms. Redgraves Elizabeth is truly and infallibly regal. In Time Andrew Niccols ""In Time"" looks great sounds stilted and plays like a clever videogame with too many rules. The premise builds on the notion that time is money. In the movies dystopian future where todays cars have tomorrows grilles time has replaced money. People are born with genetic clocks that stop at the age of 25; after that theyve got one year in which to beg borrow steal or even earn more time. If they dont the digital clocks embedded in their forearms dwindle down to zero and they time out i.e. die. Thats clever right? But then there are roving gangs called Minute Men (Teddy Boy types out of ""A Clockwork Orange"") who steal time; the borderline-silly spectacle of almost everyone looking 25; the polemic element of social injustice (the richest of the rich can live forever because theyve got eons socked away); and the action-adventure element a clumsy amalgam of Robin Hood ""Bonnie and Clyde"" ""The Avengers"" ""Les Miserables"" ""Dick Tracy"" (for the color and graphics) and Mr. Niccols earlier and impressive genetic-engineering opus ""Gattaca."" Amanda Seyfried and Justin Timberlake are the Bonnie and Clyde stand-ins though Ms. Seyfrieds makeup and wig suggest Anna Karina in an old Godard film. Its hard to judge their performances since they were clearly encouraged to be as stylized as the photography and sets by a director who given the evidence on screen came up short in the department of humor and was tone deaf to their American accents. (The English Minute Men sound fine.) It couldnt be easier on the other hand to judge Roger Deakinss cinematography Alex McDowells production design or Colleen Atwoods costumes; theyre all top-notch. Still one question lingers. In a film shot in and around Los Angeles why do all the car chases through all of the fictional regions time zones look like they were staged on the same venerable bridge across the Los Angeles River? ENLARGE Charlie Bartlett (2007) Charlie is a precocious young high-school student who both pops and pushes pills and Anton Yelchin plays him as a rich overmedicated Candide. The kids stash of the stuff is so copious thanks to an indulgent psychiatrist that he starts sharing it with his schoolmates and dispensing therapy along with the pills in the boys room. The cast includes Hope Davis at her best as Charlies libidinous mother Robert Downey Jr. as the schools bibulous principal and Kat Dennings as his daughter. Jon Poll directed from a script by Gustin Nash. The cinematographer was the estimable Paul Sarossy. Shakespeare in Love (1998) The Earl of Oxford may have written this too but Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard got screen credit for what is by unanimous agreement among Shakespearean scholars a totally fictional account of how a Bard with writers block sought help from a shrink (who timed patients sessions with an hourglass) and churned out ""Romeo and Juliet"" only after discovering his muse in a dishy brainy aristocrat named Lady Viola. Joseph Fiennes is Will Gwyneth Paltrow is Viola Geoffrey Rush is Philip Henslowe Shakespeares frantic gap-toothed producer and Judi Dench is the formidable Queen Elizabeth. The director was John Madden. Letters to Juliet (2010) Im not in love with this confection but I couldnt resist its intersections with ""Anonymous"" and ""In Time"" too. Amanda Seyfrieds Sophie a New Yorker magazine fact-checker goes to Verona to join volunteers who answer a ceaseless stream of letters addressed to Juliet. (The letter part is true.) She uncovers one written by an ardent English girl who is now a septuagenarian played by Vanessa Redgrave. And played so wonderfully well that watching her in action is like sitting in on a master class. Gary Winick directed from a cloying script by Jose Rivera and Tim Sullivan.

And the film centered on him is a clever inventive and ambitious comedy with echoes of Rushmore Ferris Buellers Day Off and even Harold and Maude. But its closest cousin is probably the more recent Juno given its satirical bent snarky dialogue and stereotype-defying characters. CLIP See what Charlie Bartlett is all about The screenplay by newcomer Gustin Nash is inventive and delightful. Like Juno and the darker teen comedies it subtly references Charlie Bartlett focuses on that singular period in our development that brings both great pain and great joy -- adolescence. Anton Yelchin (Alpha Dog) plays Charlie with just the right endearing quality undercut by a slyly iconoclastic style. He is an intelligent even cerebral problem child born with a silver spoon in his mouth. His mother (Hope Davis) is a neurotic who loves her son but doesnt have a clue how to raise him. And it cant be easy. Charlie is a clever and precocious rebel who outsmarts not only kids but adults. Though a perennial outsider who has been kicked out of every private school before landing at a more rough-and-tumble public high school Charlie finds his place and empowers other disenfranchised students. Having been ""shrunk"" for years by a bevy of psychiatrists he knows the buzzwords of the trade and has absorbed countless theories. He sees the growing need and begins to dole out counsel as his schools resident shrink. He provides thoughtful advice and common sense solutions as well as prescriptions -- all from a school bathroom stall. His recognition of the desires and despairs of his school cohorts merges with his entrepreneurial spirit transforming both Charlie and the student body. From his unlikely perch he dispassionately listens to the darkest secrets and private confessions of his classmates then starts dispensing the pills hes managed to get from his own psychiatrist. Not surprisingly he hides his newfound enterprise from his addle-pated mom. When he falls for the daughter (Kat Dennings) of the school principal (Robert Downey Jr.) things unravel. Its worth the price of admission to hear Downey rail about the evils of drugs given the actors very public past escapades. It should also be noted that despite its edgy humor Bartlett doesnt glamorize or treat lightly the problem of drug use particularly among the young. Charlie gets his comeuppance and his ""practice"" falls apart as quickly as it started. Charlie Bartlett is a refreshingly entertaining character study that refuses to dumb down its youthful cast or bury their concerns in service of a catchy soundtrack.

"Charlie Bartlett Teen drama | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesCharlie Bartlett Teen drama Charlie Bartlett is a high-school movie about troubled teenagers who desperately need some understanding and trust from their parents and from other authority figures and who end up in their wisdom showing adults the way.By Philip MarchandMoviesFri. Feb. 22 2008Starring Anton Yelchin Robert Downey Jr. Hope Davis Kat Dennings Tyler Hilton. Directed by Jon Poll. 97 minutes. At major theatres. 14A Charlie Bartlett is a high-school movie about troubled teenagers who desperately need some understanding and trust from their parents and from other authority figures and who end up in their wisdom showing adults the way.Its an age-old Hollywood theme. Do we see the ghost of James Dean drifting in and out of the teen bedrooms in the movie eyeing the laptops and television sets and videogames and guitars and cellphones and other signs of unbelievable wealth and privilege among our misunderstood teens? Does this ghost ask himself why with all our advances in communications technology these adolescents and their parents still cant communicate? Anton Yelchin (Alpha Dog) is no James Dean. As 17-year-old Charlie Bartlett hes utterly lacking in sex appeal but hes in the same boat as Deans character in Rebel Without a Cause trying to make friends with his fellow students and wishing grownups would behave like grownups. Every once in a while Bartlett flashes a big grin that announces good intentions and sincerity. Its very sweet. Article Continued BelowIf only he didnt have this mad desire to be liked by everyone. ""Maybe theres more to high school than being well liked"" his mother (Hope Davis) says. ""Like what specifically?"" her son asks. She thinks for a second. ""Nothing comes to me.""It doesnt help that the two major adults in the movie Charlies mom Marilyn and Principal Gardner (Robert Downey Jr.) the father of Charlies girlfriend Susan Gardner (Kat Dennings) heavily rely on mood-altering substances to get through the day - psychiatric medication in her case Scotch in his. No wonder that when Charlie decides to win friends by offering free psychotherapy - he sits in a toilet in the boys room while his student ""clients"" male and female sit in the adjacent cubicle like penitents in a confessional and tell him their woes - he sells prescription drugs as part of his service.This boosts his popularity day by day. ""Bringing psychiatric drugs and teenagers together is like opening a lemonade stand in the desert"" he says. Obviously his career as the Freud of the bathroom stalls cant go on. ""There are more important things than being popular"" Mr. Gardner tells Charlie in the movies climactic episode. ""Like what?"" Charlie asks. This time he gets an answer. ""Like what you do with that popularity. What you do in this life matters.""He wont get any argument from me. Or from Charlie either. He accepts this bit of wisdom and so the action finds its way to resolution. It doesnt feel much like a resolution. The characters remain halfway between genuine comic creations and realistic individuals and the whole narrative feels artificial stuck in the tension between being a morality play and a freewheeling comedy.

(AP Photo/Sidney Kimmel Entertainment Ken Woroner)  NO SALES  Photo Ken Woroner Review Charlie Bartlett teenage misfit 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Charlie Bartlett Starring Anton Yelchin Robert Downey Jr. and Hope Davis. Directed by Jon Poll. (R. 97 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Those waiting for the arrival of the next ""Juno"" may want to skip ""Charlie Bartlett"" a relentlessly earnest teen film about a 17-year-old misfit whos been tossed out of one prep school after another for bad behavior. With bits and pieces borrowed from films such as ""Ferris Buellers Day Off"" ""Weird Science"" ""Risky Business"" and a garnish or two from ""American Pie"" Gustin Nash has cobbled together the kind of screenplay that probably mirrors the awkward teenage years of guys who grew up to run major studios in Hollywood and love the idea of the high school untouchable who wins the girl becomes the most popular kid in school and triumphs over the oppressive adult world around him. Charlie (Anton Yelchin) lives in a big mansion with his booze-soaked Klonopin-popping mom Marilyn (Hope Davis) but not his father whose whereabouts remain pointedly unknown for a while. After getting pitched from his most recent prep school for manufacturing fake drivers licenses Charlie gets sent to his worst nightmare public high school where hes quickly and repeatedly pummeled by the school bully Murphey Bivens (Tyler Hilton). His continual failure to fit in lands Charlie on a shrinks couch and earns him a prescription for Ritalin. Charlie the unrepentant hustler gets an idea Hell fake psychological maladies to secure prescriptions for various pills which he and his new business partner Murphey will sell to high school kids. Meanwhile Charlie has fallen in love with Susan Gardner (Kat Dennings) who is being raised by her divorced father when hes not holed up in his study drinking every night. Why does he drink? Because hes a former history teacher whos been kicked upstairs to the job of principal of Charlie and Susans high school. Principal Gardner (Robert Downey Jr.) doesnt like Charlie dating his daughter but hes even more resentful that Charlie seems to have the world on a string and is looked to as a leader by the other kids. All of this pretty much goes where you expect it to. We cant have lots of high school kids zonked out on prescription meds for too long so Something Major and Entirely Predictable has to happen. Faster than you can say ""After-School Special but without the laughs"" Charlie is dumping the meds down the can. Other plot elements similarly telegraphed way in advance include Principal Gardner facing off with Charlie and realizing that he doesnt need booze and he ought to be a better dad; the punk loser Murphey cleaning up and getting to date the girl of his dreams; and the real truth about Charlies father finally revealed. Of course theres a big finale where all the kids get an over-the-top chance to tell the voices of adult authority that they are capable of making good choices. There may not be many films where the young hero becomes an amateur shrink and dispenses prescription drugs to his classmates but there are plenty of others where the misfit kid finds some other kind of ticket to popularity only to realize in the end that theres no substitute for family values true love being who you are or fill in the blank. The script is adequate although screenwriter Nash has created one distasteful character after another and theres barely a ripple of relieving humor in the entire film. Charlie is precocious at times bordering on insufferably so; his mother is a caricature; Principal Gardner is a gutless toady around his boss and a lousy dad when hes at home. The material might have worked better if the filmmakers had adopted a satirical tone or even if theyd gone the whole ""American Pie"" route. Instead the film grinds on with only a few bright moments. The big problem though isnt the script but rather the direction and specifically the plodding pace of the film. Thats surprising given that first-time director Jon Poll has a background in film editing. It may have something do with knowing pretty much what will happen from one moment to the next but you keep wanting Poll and his cast to get on with things or at least energize the film some way or another. The tone is often just turgid. The cast is appealing and competent for the most part. Yelchin looks like a young Ethan Hawke and is fine at depicting Charlies rise to the top of the high school heap although he cant quite manage complete credibility when Charlie has his inevitable transformation. Dennings also turns in a winning performance as one of the few completely likable characters in the film. The two young leads keep the film afloat throughout. Downey is credible as the self-loathing Principal Gardner. For the most part he mumbles and mopes through his role between swigs of booze until a final over-the-top scene toward the end that only a really great actor like Downey could pull off. Why? Because with any merely competent actor you wouldnt believe the scene for a minute. Yet for all its problems the film is often sincere often earnest. It wants so badly to offer testimony to the possibility that a loser kid can turn his life around and have the whole world cheering for him. Youll find yourself rooting for the filmmakers in spite of yourself and more to the point in spite of the mistakes theyve made. -- Advisory Contains sexual situations drug use and coarse language.

Charlie Bartlett (R) MGM (97 min.) Directed by Jon Poll. With Anton Yelchin Hope Davis Kat Jennings Robert Downey Jr. Opens Friday at theaters in New York. TWO STARS It is a lovely upscale Connecticut town -- and you know what that means. Joyless promiscuity. Senseless violence. Closeted homosexuality. Hard-core drug use. Suicidal urges. And heck those are just the teenagers. Charlie Bartlett though is their savior. Fresh from his latest prep-school expulsion he arrives at his new public high equipped with some prescribed pharmaceuticals and the vocabulary of a few therapy sessions. Astounded at his classmates deep psychological problems he decides to share. The doctor is in. Second stall from the end first-floor boys bathroom. Be sure to bring cash for the drugs. Charlie is the hero of ""Charlie Bartlett"" and its a comedy that strains so hard to be edgy it nearly pulls a muscle. Directed and written by first-timers Jon Poll and Gustin Nash its a lightly dumbed-down version of ""Rushmore"" complete with precocious preppies dysfunctional jocks and a few clueless parents. If it were a term paper it would come with footnotes. It might need an apology too. Awkwardly the film arrives today exactly one month after Heath Ledgers death. If flip jokes about our medicated nation always risked being insensitive -- whether Tom Cruise likes it or not prescription drugs have helped plenty of vulnerable people -- at this point they seem not just tasteless but dangerous. Add that to the scripts stereotyping of the suburbs and its clear its the movie that has some growing-up to do. If you can ignore the films too-cool-for-school attitude there are at least some good players here. The always wonderful Hope Davis brings a bit of humanity to Charlies mother who easily could have been a neurotic caricature. Robert Downey Jr. is dependably intense as Charlies principal a man with issues of his own. And Kat Dennings is a real find -- although shes cast as Charlies love interest shes clearly her own woman and her real-girl looks give her a quiet appeal. Less quiet though is Charlie as played by Anton Yelchin. Yelchin who has a puppyish energy and a high reedy voice comes to this straight from ""Fierce People"" and ""Alpha Dog"" and for the third time in a row hes playing the poor put-upon kid everyone wants to beat up. After a few scenes you may understand why (and start dreading anew next years re-booted ""Star Trek"" in which hell appear as Chekhov.) There are some other pleasures here including a fast pace (Poll used to be an editor specializing in making bad comedies like ""Meet the Parents"" look funnier) and crisp photography. But ultimately Nashs script falls flat having neither the surreal invention of ""Heathers"" nor the grounded-in-reality observation of ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High."" Its view of public school as an egalitarian melting pot is absurd and its stance on psychiatry is to put it mildly confused. (Apparently its a field full of nothing but quacks -- until it isnt.) Charlie Bartlett and his friends may or may not need therapy. But ""Charlie Bartlett"" needed one more rewrite. Rating note The film contains strong language substance abuse brief nudity and sexual situations. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

Between this and ""Be Kind Rewind"" it must be ""I Love the 80s"" week at the movies. Charlie played by Anton Yelchin (the cheerful kidnapping victim in ""Alpha Dog"") with over-the-top glee has been tossed out of his umpteenth private school for selling fake IDs. So he takes his crested blazer to his first public school where he is mercilessly hounded as a freak - at least until he finds a new use for the Ritalin hes been prescribed for his ADD. The hyper-articulate Charlie takes over a stall in the mens room and quickly becomes the schools unofficial shrink dispensing advice and prescription drugs he scores from a variety of real shrinks. Unlike the hero of ""Risky Business"" Charlie isnt doing it for the money - he somehow lives in a mansion and has a chauffeur despite his fathers being jailed for tax evasion - but in the hopes of becoming very very popular. Debuting director Jon Polls masterstroke was in finding a worthy adversary for Charlie. Robert Downey Jr. - who might have played Charlie back in the 80s - is ruefully funny as the harried principal a divorced alcoholic who is horrified to learn that his daughter (the delightful Kat Dennings) is dating Charlie. As he has done in other films Downey uses his real-life experience with drugs to inform his performance which has a very serious undertone below its comedy. His showdowns with Charlie (one with a gun in his hand) are the movies high points as are appearances by Hope Davis as Charlies loopy mom who exhibits plenty of inappropriate behaviors of her own. Tyler Hilton is very good as the class bully who becomes Charlies personal bodyguard and assistant; among their clients are a suicidal sexually confused classmate (Mark Rendall) and an insecure cheerleader (Megan Park). ""Charlie Bartlett"" starts to get a bit preachy as it works its way toward a climax heavily influenced by ""Rushmore"" but its still well above average for this type of film.

Last week eight Douglas County high school students had a run-in with the painkiller oxycodone that sent them to the hospital. Perhaps you havent seen that anti-drug ad featuring a jittery dealer complaining about his customers getting their drugs from their parents medicine cabinets. 1/2 RATING | Teen Dramedy ""Theyre getting high for free"" is his kicker. Nah. Theyre just going to different suppliers. The release of Jon Polls emotionally generous tonally tricky (and R-rated) dramedy about a wealthy high-schooler who ""prescribes"" drugs like Xanax Ritalin and Zoloft to his depressed anxious misunderstood classmates would always have presented challenges. Before the movie starts to surmount them its deep into its middle portion. And Charlies criminal esprit is becoming troubling. Its a stumble the film recovers from. As the movie opens Charlies peers pack an arena chanting his name. When he steps onstage mic in hand his riff is more motivational speaker than rock star. But thats just his recurring fantasy. His reality Hes a bright kid being booted from yet another boarding school this time for selling impressive fake IDs. ""Youve got to admit theyre pretty authentic-looking"" mom Marilyn (Hope Davis) tells the headmaster. Charlie Bartletts personal war resembles that of a number of the adolescents he meets at his new public high school. His resources dont. That his wealth isnt more of a sticking point to liking him has much to do with the films hopeful if misguided soul -- and its amiable cast. Anton Yelchins Charlie has a raw optimism undercut by deep need. A prescription for Ritalin scrawled by a lazy therapist has him darting around in his skivvies banging out jazz riffs on the family grand piano and literally bouncing off the walls. It also gives him an idea. He begins holding therapy sessions in the graffitied boys bathroom and writing out prescriptions for his ""patients."" His former bullier Murphy (Tyler Hilton) fills them. Watchably wounded Robert Downey Jr. plays Principal Gardner a once-beloved teacher now the reluctant authority figure. Kat Dennings is his smartly aware daughter Susan. They provide ballast. An odd thing to say perhaps since Principal Gardner is an alcoholic. But then Marilyn Bartlett washes down her antidepressants with white wine. With the help of Davis and Downey the movie sticks to a compassionate point Some self-medicating parents really do love their kids. It helps to know that Poll making his directorial debut found kin for screenwriter Gustin Nashs shadows-and-light story in Hal Ashbys cult classic ""Harold and Maude"" about a death-obsessed suicidal young man and his love for an elderly free spirit -- not a laugh riot. On the other hand it wont help much to go into the theater thinking youll see a gloss on ""Ferris Buellers Day Off."" Its risky business championing an adolescent protagonist who thrives on the illicit. But the appointments Charlie holds in the mens room make an argument most can get behind Maybe its not the drugs after all. The ""talking cure"" still has power -- especially as a listening tool for teens.

February 22 2008 Save for later Saved Charlie Bartlett (R)Director Jon Poll. With Anton Yelchin Robert Downey Jr. (97 min.)No doubt the filmmakers of ""Charlie Bartlett"" were hoping for a new-style ""Ferris Buellers Day Off"" but the results are rather rancid. Anton Yelchin plays Charlie a preppy high-schooler who becomes a kind of psychiatrist to his classmates. By siphoning drug prescriptions from the family psychiatrist Charlie supplies drugs to everyone who claims to need them. Yelchin gives Charlie a fresh-faced naivete that raises the question Is he a do-gooder or a villain? And do you care? Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Grade B- - Peter Rainer Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? The Counterfeiters (R)Director Stefan Ruzowitsky. With Karl Markovics. (99 min.)""The Counterfeiters"" tells the true story of Salomon ""Sully"" Sorowitsch (Karl Markovics) a Jewish concentration-camp inmate and expert forger who along with fellow imprisoned forgers bankers and printers was forced to fuel the German war effort by crafting bales of counterfeit cash. The moral dilemmas posed by this operation are dramatically rendered and without once resorting to cant. A tale of survival in all its ramifications and Markovicss intense performance holds it all together. The favorite for this years Oscar for best foreign film. Grade A- - P.R.

"A high school comedy with brains - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsReal EstateLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review A high school comedy with brains Anton Yelchin in the title role counsels Kat Dennings from his usual spot. (Ken Woroner/Sidney Kimmel Entertainment) Email|Print| Text size - + By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / February 22 2008 It takes a minute for ""Charlie Bartlett"" to distinguish itself from the movies and books it appears to be ripping off. But once it does the movie transforms into an exuberant unexpectedly smart comedy about the fraught give-and-take between kids and grown-ups. The title hero (Anton Yelchin) is a preppie who having been evicted from yet another Connecticut boarding academy for assorted scams shows up at a public school in a blue blazer desperate for the student body to love him. His mother (Hope Davis) is an over-medicated lush whos happy hes back in the mansion.The movie smells like ""Catcher in the Rye"" and some of its loose offspring like ""Ferris Buellers Day Off"" and in particular ""Rushmore"" especially after we find out the public-school principal (Robert Downey Jr.) is a self-loathing drunk who likes to wallow by his swimming pool the way Bill Murray did in ""Rushmore."" But Charlie isnt cynical or acutely arch. The movie seems allergic to phoniness. And Downey whos shrewdly cast hasnt e-mailed in his performance.The racially variegated school Charlie has landed in is full of insecure and unhappy kids who feel better baring their souls to him in the stalls of the boys bathroom. He sits in one stall and the ""patient"" parks in the adjacent one undergoing therapy with the faux-anonymity of Catholic confession. Charlie fakes their symptoms for an assortment of shrinks who write him prescriptions which he fills and resells for 10 at school. The surprise is that Charlie is actually a talented shrink. He asks questions that lead to actual answers. He listens.In exchange for his psychiatric prowess Charlie conquers the school taming his chain-smoking weed-dealing bully (Tyler Hilton) befriending the lovable slow kid (Dylan Taylor) and handing his virginity to Susan (Kat Dennings) the wonderful eyelinered drama girl who happens to be the principals daughter. Director Jon Poll (a veteran film editor) and writer Gustin Nash making their debuts have whipped up the rare high school movie that doesnt see teenagers as jokes itching to be told or tragedies waiting to happen. It helps tremendously that every single young actor in this movie has a natural unforced personality and a plain face you dont often see in Hollywood. They also seem as though they might have attended an actual high school.What the movie lacks in technical polish (its not very handsome-looking) and dramatic perfection it makes up for in unusual social sophistication. No one is happy staying within the lines of his or her type. The slut wants romance. The suicide case wants stage fame. The jock wants to paint. Charlie the spoiled preppie doesnt want entitlement. And the principal really just wants to teach. School isnt the prison these people perceive it to be. The caste system is.An eccentric unfashionably corny movie grows from this organic expansion of types. Cat Stevenss ""If You Want to Sing Out Sing Out"" is performed at least twice. And Charlie appears to enjoy nothing more than sitting at the piano and singing the ""All in the Family"" theme song with his mother. The movie is set in this century but its heart beats in 1971. Yelchin even has the mischievously expressive face of a Bob Fosse dancer. Its boyish but the mysterious angles are possibly hand-carved. He could be playing a politician named Pinocchio. We never meet Charlies dad (hes in a white-collar prison) but Im betting its Geppetto.Yelchin who was impressive as the kidnappee in ""Alpha Dog"" is also a striking actor. You dont notice him here until a school-play audition where he breaks character to become a flamboyant queen in something called ""Misadventures of a Teen Renegade."" (If the movie is even a little bit of a hit the line ""Daddy I think Im sluffing"" will live forever.) But even when hes just listening as he is in a couple of beautiful scenes with Dennings hes still captivating.""Charlie Bartlett"" is just as preoccupied with the give-and-take between authority and rebellion as its peers. But this movie is unique in its unwillingness to cede ground to either side. Neither the kids nor the adults have the upper hand for long. The grown-ups as dysfunctional as they are (namely the principal) have the wisdom of experience - and Charlie being the listener he is actually pays attention. The movie may well be propaganda in the student-administrator wars. But if Robert Downey Jr. wants to give me a lecture about the downside of drug use Im all ears.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/movies/blog.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Like its hero ""Charlie Bartlett"" is urgently eager to please. Charlie a rich teen booted from his elite school for faking IDs walks the unruly hallways of his new public high school with a handshake and a cheery hello for nerds jocks and punks alike. Anton Yelchin (Ensign Chekov in the upcoming ""Star Trek"") plays him with wide eyes and a fixed smile a one-man charm offensive. His bottomless need for acceptance makes Charlie a less edgy relation of Ferris Beuller and ""Rushmores"" Max Fischer and the film suffers from a similar emphasis on surface charm over quirky individuality. Charlies mild-mannered amiability may be a trait he absorbed during the years he has spent with his familys on-call psychiatrist and it serves him well as he navigates his new schools treacherous social ecosystem. Everyone he encounters is a coming-of-age character type with an easily diagnosed strain of teen anxiety. School thug Murph (Tyler Hilton who resembles Morrissey with a mohawk) has low self-esteem. The cheerleader cant say no and the football star cant tell his dad he wants to go to art school. Sarcastic drama student Susan (Kat Dennings) feels suffocated by her father the principal. Charlie with a practiced sensitivity to teen angst becomes the schools unofficial therapist. He learns each students symptoms parrots them back to his doctors and returns to campus with a pharmacys worth of mood meds. Before you can say benzodiazepine hes selling chemical cheer from a makeshift dispensary in the boys bathroom and doing talk therapy confessional-style in the toilet stalls. The plot is played for lightweight fun until an overdose clouds the mood the students riot to protest newly installed surveillance cameras and family tensions at the principals house come to a boil. The film scores a casting coup with rehab poster boy Robert Downey Jr. who brings gravity and impeccable comic timing to the role of the overwhelmed boozing administrator. He and Hope Davis underplaying Charlies daffy mom (who considers wine tastings a great bonding activity) deliver strong darkly funny performances. Her idea of parenting is leaving a note that says ""Ritalin in bag dinner in oven Mom."" Alas the storys sense of inauthenticity overwhelms their contributions and Yelchins agreeable presence. The first directorial outing by ace comedy editor Jon Poll (""Austin Powers"" ""Meet the Parents"") the film feels like an old persons notion of how young people live. The musical bash where Charlie tastefuly loses his virginity looks as if it was re-created from memories of groovy Lovin Spoonful concerts and the interplay of laughs and drama is strictly ""Afterschool Special."" Its uplifting to see a story where every significant character ends up a little better than they started but the path to that resolution is unconvincing and flat. We come to see that Charlie is immersing himself in other peoples problems as a distraction from his own; in the same way ""Charlie Bartlett"" is a minor short-term tranquilizer not a miracle cure.

"Charlie Heal Thyself washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Charlie Heal Thyself Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints Friday February 22 2008 ""Charlie Bartlett"" tries to acquire a sort of greatness by osmosis by revisiting the intellectually rebellious archetype of many classic teen movies such as ""Rebel Without a Cause"" and ""Rushmore."" Its built around Charlie (Anton Yelchin) a sweet-faced but perpetually scheming student whose penchant for bootleg activities such as issuing fake IDs keeps getting him thrown out of prep schools. In desperation his mother enrolls Charlie in a public school where he immediately appoints the school bully to help him become the student bodys main rainmaker the one who procures them various psychotropic meds including Ritalin and Xanax and also becomes an in-house shrink listening to their problems from his office in the restroom. Even with the presence of Robert Downey Jr. cast against type as a beleaguered headmaster and frustrated father of a teenage daughter and Hope Davis as the rich devoted but inattentive mother of our titular hero the movie feels forced cliched and derivative. Not surprisingly we learn that parents need to listen more often to what their kids are saying. What Charlie really needs is a scriptwriter whos forceful and creative enough to break new ground. -- Desson Thomson Charlie Bartlett R 97 minutes Contains drug use nudity sexual content and profanity.

The film about a pregnant teenager is smart funny and above all quirky. For those of us who love quirky when its done right thats a good thing. Perhaps itll lead to a slew of similarly offbeat features. Except For the filmmakers who deal in quirkiness maybe thats not so great. Theyve got a new standard to live up to and although comparisons may be unfair theyre inevitable. Charlie Bartlett nothing if not quirky doesnt reach such lofty heights. It overdoes the quirkiness and underdoes the character development but in the end its salvaged by a remarkable performance by Robert Downey Jr. who hardly ever gives any other kind. Charlie (Anton Yelchin) is a rich kid who keeps getting kicked out of private schools. So his mom (Hope Davis) who has no clue how to raise Charlie (his dad is um not present for reasons that are revealed slowly) enrolls him in a public high school. Charlie immediately becomes the target of ridicule and ire for among other things wearing the crested blazer of his previous school and carrying a briefcase. But Charlie is nothing if not ambitious (he got kicked out of his last school for making fake drivers licenses). Soon he has enlisted the aid of his chief tormentor the Mohawk-sporting bully Murphey (Tyler Hilton) and using the drugs prescribed to him by a parade of psychiatrists is offering counseling and prescriptions from inside the stalls of the school bathroom. Before you know it Charlie Bartlett is a folk hero. Principal Gardner (Downey) is a little slow to catch on to whats happening - or to the fact that Charlie is dating his daughter Susan (Kat Dennings). Gardner has his own troubles A former history teacher and reluctant administrator he has slid into alcoholism to deaden his frustration and resentment over his ineffectiveness. But he does figure things out and the confrontations between Downey and Yelchin are the best things about the film. The only problem is that Yelchin isnt particularly likable as Charlie - not exactly a plus in a leading character - and Downey is so magnetic that you wind up wanting Gardner to triumph on every occasion even when you (and he) know hes wrong. The movie paints itself into a bit of a corner - a kid illegally selling antidepressants to his classmates probably isnt going to be allowed to ride off happily into the sunset without some sort of comeuppance. The resolutions to these problems arent terribly effective - the dichotomy between comedy and drama unravels at this point - but at least they offer Downey more chances to delve deeper into Gardners psyche. Gardner by the way is plenty quirky. But like the characters and the story in Juno hes also grounded in something real something genuine (in his case pain). Theres just not enough of that in Charlie Bartlett. Quirky is great as far as it goes. But eventually it has to go somewhere. Reach Goodykoontz at 602-444-8974 or bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

"Charlie Bartlett | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; charlie-bartlett ) Charlie Bartlett (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli Its a given that most comedies centered around kids and high schools will involve to one degree or another the subject of popularity. For the average teenager few things are more important than being liked. The ultimate high is being recognized and respected by the entire student body. Of course looking back from the perspective of years (or decades) it all seems so superficial but thats not how it feels ""in the moment."" Despite a maddeningly inconsistent tone Charlie Bartlett takes viewers back into the classrooms and hallways of high school as it follows the improbable climb of one student from outcast to icon and observes the consequences of his popularity. Charlie (Anton Yelchin) is smart glib and unflappable. Hes a 30-year old trapped in the body of a 17-year old. He may be a virgin but his mind is active and hes never at a loss for words. He also has a habit of being expelled from private schools. His mother Marilyn (Hope Davis) is an enabler - her solution is to turn a blind eye to Charlies faults. His father is an absentee dad spending his days and nights in prison where he serves a term for tax evasion. Eventually Charlie ends up in public school. When he arrives there dressed in a suit and tie the ridicule starts. It ends with him being brutally beaten up by the school bully Murphey Bivens (Tyler Hilton). Undaunted Charlie visits a psychiatrist to bemoan his lack of popularity. The therapists suggestion he take Ritalin. After trying out the drug for a few days Charlie has an idea sell it to students. Suddenly ""Dr. Charlie"" is known and loved by all. He holds court in the boys lavatory. He sits in one stall while his patient sits in the next pouring out his or her lifes story. It ends with a ""prescription"" for drugs dispensed by Charlies new partner Murphey. The schools principal (Robert Downey Jr.) knows somethings up but he cant find any proof. To make matters worse for him his daughter Susan (Kat Dennings) is head-over-heels for the drug dealer with a heart of gold. Its impossible to label Charlie Bartlett as any one thing because it veers (sometimes erratically) from one genre to the next. At one point its a satire. At another its a teen comedy. Then its a drama. Then a message piece. At times it recalls the teen movies of the 1980s. Some may see shades of Rushmore in it. To me the film it most strong resembles is the 1990 Christian Slater film Pump Up the Volume. Charlie Bartlett isnt as angry but a lot of the same thematic ground is covered and many of the same plot points are stitched together to form the storyline. I appreciate most of the performances. Anton Yelchin is fresh and likable as Charlie. Kat Dennings makes us care about the underdeveloped character of the girlfriend who happens to be the principals daughter. Hope Davis turns on the comedic charm as the ditzy Marilyn. But the real scene stealer not surprisingly is Robert Downey Jr. whose completely serious acting is riveting to watch. Once again Downey is playing an alcoholic but this time its not the sole defining trait of his character. The films centerpiece scene features Downey Yelchin and a gun. Yelchin and the gun do their best to hold their own but the sequence belongs to Downey. Editor-turned-director Jon Poll makes his feature debut with Charlie Bartlett and its mostly successful. The movie isnt afraid to tackle tough subjects including the price of high school popularity and the cavalier nature with which drugs like Ritalin are prescribed. Theres plenty of serious stuff buried underneath a seemingly unambitious story. But Charlie is a fascinating individual and his relationships with Susan and her father dont feel contrived. There are times when Poll has trouble navigating the difficulties of quick switches from comedy to drama (resulting in some awkward scenes and/or transitions) but for the most part he handles the tricky material adroitly. I would classify Charlie Bartlett as a smart teen film. Its more ambitious and overall more successful than its 80s forebears even though the resemblance is unmistakable. Sadly the MPAA has acted to keep the movies perfect audience - 13-to-17 year olds - away from the movie because it has a few too many ""fucks"" and a brief shot of bare breasts. Hopefully teenagers will find a way to see the movie even if they have to wait until its arrival on DVD. In the meantime Charlie Bartlett is worth the price of admission for those adults who want to think back to high school and find out whether The Doctor Is In.

In the comic vein of ""Ferris Buellers Day Off"" or ""Rushmore"" frosh scribe Gustin Nash tosses out disposable moral lessons by the barrelful while editor-turned-helmer Jon Poll gleefully bats them over the fence in ""Charlie Bartlett."" Rollicking story of a rich kid whose wildly successful bid for popularity has him playing drug-distributing shrink to an entire high school boasts pitch-perfect faceoffs between upstart Anton Yelchin and alcoholic principal Robert Downey Jr. that could fuel a chemistry lab. Skedded for Aug. 3 release sweetly subversive pic offers a chancy box office alternative to by-the-numbers summer fare. Yelchins adolescent Charlie Bartlett is an adorable sincere -- and slick -- popularity-seeker. Introduced in the process of being kicked out of his umpteenth posh private school this time for creating fake IDs (""Well you have to admit they look very authentic"" mother Hope Davis admiringly remarks) Charlie is sent off to public school sporting a Latin-mottoed blazer and leather attache case. Unfazed by mockery beatings and having his head shoved into the toilet Charlie continues to make friendly overtures to pretty girls bullies the retarded football heroes and nerds equally. Driven by a strange mix of curiosity empathy and benign manipulation to figure out exactly what makes people tick he easily ascends to the role of school psychiatrist setting up his practice in the boys lavatory; he is greatly abetted by his access via the family psychiatrist to endless supplies of medications. Charlie starts dating Susan (Kat Dennings) the daughter of Principal Gardner (Downey) whose move from iconoclastic history teacher to repressive bureaucrat has already driven him deep into the bottle. Soon the principal finds his professional and parental authority usurped by a fresh-faced teen with a ""helpful"" answer for everything. As the link between Yelchin and Downey Dennings packs less emotional ammo but has a sensual sense of humor that almost fits the bill. Teen heartthrob Tyler Hilton is priceless as a Mohawk-coiffed bully who undergoes various transformations under Charlies tutelage. Pic is chock-full of character-building epiphanies and precautionary warnings parents can comfortingly latch onto if blind to the fact that few of the homilies really stick; none of them makes the same impression as Downeys drunken pistol-packing exhortation to never attack a gun-waving drunk. Nor for that matter can they hold a candle to the loopy TV-theme duets sung by Charlie and his mother flawlessly executed in vintage jazz style. Though the filmmakers no doubt believe that carelessly administered prescription drugs can be harmful the sight of Charlie bouncing off the walls on Ritalin provides a joyous wallow in vintage Sennett-style overcranking. Pic makes a strong case for a solid writer-director split since Nashs sententious-leaning script passing through the anarchic energy of Polls direction creates precisely balanced anomalies -- like Charlie himself and those lovely multilayered exchanges between Downey and Yelchin. Toronto-shot pic plainly profits from its transposed locations by the hiring of Canuck lenser Paul Sarossy The same transparent intimacy usually informing Atom Egoyans psychological labyrinths is here placed in the service of clear-eyed comedy.

Elizabeth Weitzman Tuesday June 3 2008 1142 AM CHARLIE BARTLETT. High-school satire about an unlikely teen rebel. With Anton Yelchin Robert Downey Jr. Director Jon Poll (137). R Language drugs nudity. At area theaters.Its not hard to guess how director Jon Poll spent the 80s His first movie is an affectionate callback to ""My Bodyguard"" ""Risky Business"" and every high-school movie John Hughes ever made. But while ""Charlie Bartlett"" cheerfully wears all those influences on its sleeve what matters most is that it wears them well. When we first meet Charlie (Anton Yelchin) hes getting kicked out of his umpteenth private school this time for making fake IDs. Hes not a bad guy - in fact hes unshakably sweet - but hes also pretty confused. His father is gone and his mother (Hope Davis) is too doped up to be much help though she does offer her own sort of support. Mostly this comes in the form of pharmaceuticals which the family shrink is always happy to supply. When Charlie is sent to public school its clear hes going to have to adapt and fast. A rich kid in a small pond hes beaten up within minutes of his arrival. Desperate for acceptance he presents school bully Bivens (Tyler Hilton) with a proposition. Hell supply a steady stream of drugs and Bivens will sell them. And theres a bonus along with the Ritalin and Xanax Charlie will offer every student insights gleaned from years of therapy. Soon things are going swimmingly - hes so popular hes even dating the principals daughter (an appealing Kat Dennings). But that brings unwanted attention and its not long before Principal Gardner (Robert Downey Jr.) is threatening to expose the deceptively mature Charlie for the insecure kid he actually is. Poll encourages his lead to make the most of Gustin Nashs sharply funny script resulting in a go-for-broke performance thats bound to earn him attention. And while the 19-year-old Yelchin has been playing precocious naifs for far too long its usually in films that get little notice (""House of D"" ""Fierce People"" ""Alpha Dog""). If this proves to be his breakout role - and it very well may - itll be interesting to see what kind of grownup hes ready to be. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.
