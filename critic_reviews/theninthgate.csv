This is really a shaggy devil story whose giddy ironic tone may throw viewers expecting a scary movie. Roman Polanskis ""The Ninth Gate"" is a sardonic detective thriller peppered with carefully crafted pleasures not the least of which is a snide approach to wealthy people with a decadent streak. Whether general audiences will find the story sufficiently suspenseful to turn out in large numbers is up for grabs for although the pieces fit nicely this is really a shaggy devil story whose giddy ironic tone may throw viewers expecting a scary movie. Pic adapted from one of Spains all-time bestsellers opened Wednesday in Gaul in a crowded field of new releases. It bows in December Stateside where Artisan may have to find a hook stronger than the pairing of Polanski and Johnny Depp to lure ticketbuyers. When a powerful New Yorker hellbent on completing his collection of rare books concerning Lucifer commissions an ambitious young broker to track down two special tomes the lad has a devil of a time completing his assignment. Rosemary was mighty bummed out when she discovered who had fathered her baby but this go-between -- played with suave expediency by Depp -- has no such qualms. Pics always assured baroquely funny tone is set in opening sequence in which an elderly gentleman in a book-lined study pens a suicide note before hanging himself from the chandelier. His widow Liana Telfer (Lena Olin) doesnt know yet that her late spouse (played by ace art director Willy Holt who designed Polanskis ""Bitter Moon"") sold one of his most valuable books -- one of only three known copies of ""The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows"" -- to a fellow collector the day before. Dean Corso (Depp) is a crafty mercenary rare-book broker a sort of gumshoe who tracks down volumes for wealthy clients. Filthy-rich Manhattanite Boris Balkan (Frank Langella) now owns the Telfer book whose author was burned at the stake in the 1600s for having allegedly written and illustrated it in a league with the devil. Balkan engages Corso to examine the other two editions which are in the possession of a Mr. Fargas in Portugal and a baroness named Kessler in Paris. His mission -- on an unlimited expense account -- is to compare the three books to ascertain whether any are forgeries. Corso starts with Mrs. Telfer who seems tame enough but soon demonstrates that she would really like to get the book back. Corso also starts glimpsing a striking young woman in sneakers (Emmanuelle Seigner) at the oddest moments. When Corsos bookshop-owning pal Bernie (James Russo) ends up dead -- strung upside down just like the unfortunate fellow in the first of nine etchings in the valuable book -- Corso hightails it to Europe with the trouble-attracting tome in his ever-present shoulder bag. His visit to the Ceniza Bros. bookshop in Toledo Spain where the Telfers acquired the book is a hoot. The twin brothers give the already quite knowledgeable Corso a short course in the marvels of bygone printing and bookbinding. It turns out the ancient engravings that illustrate the three copies of the book give a new meaning to underground literature. And somebody -- or more than one somebody -- will stop at nothing to assemble the clues needed to conjure Satan. Although its a complete coincidence its worth noting that there are several similarities between ""The Ninth Gate"" and ""Eyes Wide Shut."" With the Polanski film arriving in the U.S. five months after the Kubrick (in France the positions are reversed with ""Gate"" preceding ""Eyes"" by three weeks) moviegoers might wonder ""What is it with elder statesmen of cinema sending handsome young men on creepy addictive quests that lead to wealthy and powerful people with a more than passing interest in black masses and orgies?"" In addition to convincingly re-creating New York City in European studios both films are based on foreign lit beautifully made and ultimately rather silly -- there must have been a shortage of burnooses in Europe while both pics were in production. If your story calls for a street-smart American who might be able to beat erudite Europeans at their own centuries-old game Depp is a good choice. Olin does her determined hellcat routine with gusto Langella convinces even in pics loonier moments Shakespearean vet Barbara Jefford is terrific as the baroness and Seigner while not as versatile as the other thesps is well cast here as an enigmatic graduate of the Deus Ex Machina School of Plot Points. In an amusing touch the twin Ceniza Bros. are played by one Jose Lopez Rodero who turns up in two more small roles in the film and also happens to be the films production manager in Spain. Dean Tavoularis production design is aces Darius Khondjis widescreen lensing on location in France Portugal and Spain is fine and Wojciech Kilars score is delightfully playfully ominous. There are already rumblings that Polanskis Euro version may be altered for U.S. release.

The Ninth Gate Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2000) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-ninth-gate-2000,200,theninthgate5,theninthgate,rogerebert
"`The Ninth Gate Off to Hell in a Handbasket Trusty Book in Hand March 10 2000 FILM REVIEW `The Ninth Gate Off to Hell in a Handbasket Trusty Book in Hand Related Articles The New York Times on the Web Current Film Forum Join a Discussion on Current Film By ELVIS MITCHELL or those with an interest in seeing a dinner-theater version of ""Eyes Wide Shut"" then look no further. Roman Polanskis ""Ninth Gate"" with its wizened decadence -- Darius Khondjis velveteen cinematography looks as if it came out of Rembrandts Fotomat -- and its tired stabs at comedy is calling your name. Frank Langella wearing a hairpiece that is most assuredly from the Stygian depths of Hell is Boris Balkan a wealthy and therefore evil collector of Devil-inspired antiquities who hires Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) a weedy rogue book dealer to locate a volume called ""The Nine Gates."" You can tell that Corso is a rebel kind of book dealer he smokes as he pores over vintage tomes and he doesnt wear gloves to keep his skin oils from the delicate pages. Balkan hires Corso to find the volume that will unlock the Nine Gates. The book is so pernicious that it drives an elderly man to hang himself from a noose that doesnt look capable of supporting a pair of socks. Equipped with debonair slashes of white across the sides of his head Corso begins a search that will take him over several continents and at least 90 minutes because there are three versions of the book in question. He must ascertain which ""Gates"" is authentic and stay a step ahead of Liana (Lena Olin) who cuts a striking figure in black; she was born to be a widow. It was her husband who killed himself driven mad by some intoxicating combination of her fatale figure and having such a horrific tome in his possession. Aided by his aerodynamic hair detailing Corso goes from one ""Gates"" owner to another to check out their copies. Hes pursued by a sylph (Emmanuelle Seigner) with the vacant stare and bored pout of a 14-year-old idly channel-surfing in hopes of finding MTVs Carson Daly. She races across Europe after Corso. Is she on Corsos side? Will Balkan get Satans powers in his clutches through mastery of ""The Nine Gates""? And what about Satan? Since the rich in these Devil-quest spectaculars are always searching for the Devil but often come to a bad end does this mean hes a socialist? Or perhaps since money attracts money that hes a supply-sider? These are questions to be answered sooner or later in an issue of Cahiers du Cinema. Or The Industry Standard. In adapting the European slight-fright best seller ""El Club Dumas"" Mr. Polanski is out to cross ""Rosemarys Baby"" with his saucy spoof ""The Fearless Vampire Killers"" but this movie is about as scary as a sock-puppet re-enactment of ""The Blair Witch Project"" and not nearly as funny. Theres no leading man less interested in staying close to type than Mr. Depp. His Dean Corso is a craven hustler who makes the detached cowardly Ichabod Crane he portrayed in ""Sleepy Hollow"" seem as forceful as Buffy the Vampire Slayer; he shows no interest in vesting learned characters with courage. Mr. Polanskis reflexes are gone so all he can do is watch the camera pass gracefully from set to set. ""The Ninth Gate"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes a lovemaking scene more appropriate for late-night cable viewing violence sadism and adult language. THE NINTH GATE Produced and directed by Roman Polanski; written by Enrique Urbizu Mr. Polanski and John Brownjohn based on the novel ``El Club Dumas by Arturo P.erez-Reverte; director of photography Darius Khondji; edited by Herv.e de Luze; music by Wojciech Kilar; production designer Dean Tavoularis; released cobiby Artisan Entertainmentcoei. Running time 133 minutes. This film is rated R.

The color palette is right; it suggests secrets and mystery hinting at wisdom and wealth since rare old books are expensive. Early on I thought I could almost smell the sharp must of the leather bindings. But it turns out I was trying to judge a book by its cover. That scent was just the aroma of middle-brow art-house Euro-rot a whiff of decay and hauteur in a film not even a star as foxed and foxy as Johnny Depp himself could save. And believe me he tries before giving up in sullen frustration. In The Ninth Gate Depp calls upon all his valuable skill at fleshing out brooders (Sleepy Hollow) and loners (Edward Scissorhands) to play a skulking book merchant named Dean Corso a vaguely louche fellow part scholar and part mercenary whose weaknesses are drinking amber liquor smoking Lucky Strikes and cutting ethical corners to buy low and sell high. (Depp excels at simultaneously projecting refinement and grunge.) Corso is engaged by Boris Balkan (Frank Langella fully reptilian) a snooty collector with deep pockets keen on demonology who has just obtained one of three known copies of The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of the Shadows a guide to satanic powers. The younger mans mission in this adaptation of the novel El Club Dumas by Arturo Perez-Reverte is to track down the other two copies for authentication. Its clear of course just from the volumes medieval-looking woodcuts with their arcane clues and riddles that Balkans new acquisition is incendiary stuff. Accordingly death destruction and bad karma follow Corso everywhere as he chases his quarry first in New York (more like a smudged overseas facsimile) then in Portugal and Paris. Hes tormented by a rapacious widow (Lena Olin swinging her hair). He disrupts the life of an imperious baroness (Barbara Jefford). And hes watched over by a mysterious chick with bedroom eyes (Polanskis personal mysterious chick wife Emmanuelle Seigner). Like pages falling out of an old tome the plot of The Ninth Gate comes unglued slowly. But Polanski is too admiring of his woodcuts-come-to-life to notice. By the time Corso and his beatific exotic bodyguard piece the puzzle together to surprise a gathering of satanists at a French chateau the director has abandoned all semblance of dramatic tension. Instead indulging his taste for creepy voluptuousness he stages a convocation as quaintly recherche as the costume orgy in Eyes Wide Shut. The Baroness a steely gal in a wheelchair who sports the implacable coiffure of grandes dames the world over calls Corso and his professional ilk ""voolves in ships clothing."" But its Polanski whos the lupine one leering and lecturing hysterically about sins of excess (whether its too much sex materialism God or the devil) while enjoying in that continental way of his all that the decline of civilization has to offer.

"Ninth Gate The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; ninth-gate-the ) Ninth Gate The (France/Spain 1999) A movie review by James Berardinelli The Ninth Gate has two modes tedious and moronic with the two not being mutually exclusive. Then one-hundred minutes into this seemingly interminable movie (which clocks in at about 210) things take a turn for the worse and The Ninth Gate spirals out of control. A jaw-droppingly bad mixture of film noir and the occult this picture plods and meanders its way through one uninspired scene after another until it reaches an improbable laughable climax followed by an equally ridiculous denouement. Only the lobotomized and the brain dead will be able to figure out the logic embraced by The Ninth Gate. Director Roman Polanski has the kind of larger-than-life reputation that will easily survive The Ninth Gate. In fact a few months from now no one will remember that he was involved with the film (actually in a few months no one will remember the film). Polanskis reputation will forever be defined by three things the murder of his first wife Sharon Tate at the hands of Charles Manson his conviction on one count of statutory rape and his direction of one of the best noir thrillers of all time Chinatown. Nevertheless Polanski has not done anything worthwhile in the last two decades and The Ninth Gate will not raise his name back into the publics consciousness. The film stars Johnny Depp (who according to reports from the set did not get along well with the director) as Dean Corso a rare books dealer with a reputation for working on the shady side of the law. One day a frequent client the vaguely vampiric Boris Balkan (played by ex-Dracula Frank Langella) makes Corso an offer thats too lucrative to refuse even if it involves some blatantly illegal activities. Balkan has just come into possession of a copy of The Ninth Gate a 17th century occult tome supposedly co-written by Lucifer. There are only three copies in existence and Balkan wants Corso to make a trip to Europe locate those versions and compare them to his. As the gumshoe-like protagonist begins his adventure bodies start littering his wake and a former owner of The Ninth Gate the unhinged Liana Telfer (Lena Olin) seems determined to get it back. To that end she has vigorous sex with Corso attacks him like a feral dog then sends a henchman after him. Meanwhile Corso receives some unexpected help from an unnamed girl (Polanskis half-his-age wife Emmanuelle Seigner) whose eyes glow and change color. But is she a succubus or a guardian angel? And will he sleep with her too? (Since its pretty much a given that Seigner is going to take her clothes off at some point theres not too much suspense about the answer to that question.) Despite all of the plots contortions and weird detours its not that difficult to piece together. Its like bad David Lynch. In a way I almost wish I had been confused - maybe then the final 30 minutes would have been more satisfying. After all when you dont understand something theres at least the possibility that youre missing some profound theme. No such luck here. At least a few things happen during the latter portion of the film (theres a clandestine meeting of a group of Eyes Wide Shut wannabes Seigner does the expected and takes her clothes off and one person tries the Kentucky Fried Chicken method of greeting Satan) which is more than can be said of what precedes it. To see the ending it may be necessary to request a wakeup call beforehand. Amidst the sloppiness that is The Ninth Gate Johnny Depp acquits himself reasonably well - he realizes that no one could possibly take the film seriously so he plays his role with tongue planted in cheek. If only his fellow actors had shared that approach. Lena Olin and Frank Langella have a tendency to froth at the mouth (something theyre both known for) and Emmanuelle Seigner shows her usual lack of flair and range. She pouts her way through the movie wearing dowdy clothing that greatly diminishes her one notable asset sex appeal. (Polanski surely doesnt put her in his films because he thinks she can act.) When considering The Ninth Gates cast one cant help reflecting on the fact that Depp once played the title role in Ed Wood and that this kind of glorified schlock would have sent Wood into a frenzy of orgasmic bliss. Artifice abounds. Some will argue that because the film is about the occult and the manipulation of fate this is not a liability. I disagree and view The Ninth Gates numerous contrivances as an example of lazy uninspired writing. Not having read the novel from which the script was derived (The Club Dumas by Arturo PA(c)rez-Reverte) I dont know whether to blame the original author the three men who adapted it for the screen or a combination of both. Regardless the result is messy and unconvincing. For anyone on a quest to have a motion picture double feature of unparalleled badness couple The Ninth Gate with Mission to Mars. Afterwards if your sanity is still intact and youre not in jail for killing the projectionist you may never want to see the inside of a multiplex again.

Starring Johnny Depp. Directed by Roman Polanski. (R. 132 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Someone asks Dean Corso  the unscrupulous rare-book specialist played by Johnny Depp in ""The Ninth Gate"" Do you believe in the supernatural? ""I believe in my percentage"" Corso replies. Someone might have asked director Roman Polanski the same question. He has come up with 75 percent of a very good movie but has a dickens of a time with the supernatural ending. Depp is the best reason to see Polanskis satanic thriller. Corso is a rather shady character hired to track down an occult volume. In eyeglasses and goatee Depp looks like a rogue scholar and behaves like a film-noir detective as he discovers the volume may summon up the devil. Polanski cannot prevent the ending from summoning up the ridiculous but that may have been his intention in this darkly funny film. Surely no one underestimates Depp as an actor any longer especially admirers of his trio of Tim Burton films (""Edward Scissorhands"" ""Ed Wood"" and ""Sleepy Hollow""). In ""The Ninth Gate"" Depp generates heat that reflects off the actors he plays opposite. Lena Olin is a femme fatale who pulls up her skirt to show him she has no automatic in her stockings and in the process shows him whats really dangerous. Emmanuelle Seigner (Polanskis wife) is a figure who shows up out of the blue on a motorcycle when needed and begins to look very much like a guardian angel. Frank Langella who demonstrated his availability to go over the top as Quilty in Adrian Lynes ""Lolita"" obviously is still willing to do so. As a New York publisher he gets the ball rolling by hiring Corso to find a suppressed masterpiece to complete his collection of books written with ""such an illustrious collaborator"" -- Satan. The volumes last owner committed suicide. Polanskis sly sense of film-noir conventions pokes fun at the genre while at the same time honoring it. Depp makes Corso a roguish anti-hero who smokes drinks cheats the gullible and plays around the edges of the legal. When he links up with Seigner the film takes on the feel of an international adventure that takes them to Portugal Spain and Paris. His search for the pentacle-emblazoned volume leads him to a kindred spirit the wheelchair-bound Baroness Kessler (Barbara Jefford) who says ""In my profession to be spoken well of can be professionally disastrous."" The name of the volume that leads to the devil is ""The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of the Shadows"" and attentive viewers may want to keep track of the number of doorways Corso goes through. ..
