"USATODAY.com - Someone seductive as a wet noodle Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 03/29/2001 - Updated 0630 PM ET Someone seductive as a wet noodle By Susan Wloszczyna USA TODAY Someone Like You (out of four) Stars Ashley Judd Hugh Jackman Greg Kinnear Ellen Barkin Marisa Tomei Director Tony Goldwyn Distributor 20th Century Fox Rating PG-13 for sexual content including dialogue and some language Someone Like You is not merely a blah romantic comedy that has the bad taste to force the heavenly Ashley Judd into being an insecure date-desperate quirky career gal. You know the type who has to blow the dust off of her diaphragm when an opportunity for intimacy at long last presents itself. Or when shes in a funk reaches for the designer ice cream and gobbles it right out of the carton. The performance will leave you wondering ""Could this possibly be the kick-ass avenger from Double Jeopardy or a Meg Ryan clone with a better haircut?"" The movie also is an intro course on relationships When Harry Met Sally ... for agricultural majors. It offers its own supposedly amusing theory based on bovine mating habits that explains why men tend to stray. Basically bulls never service the same cow twice. Why? Because bulls are pigs. They want a fresh new cow not a used old cow. All this Animal Planet drivel explains why men leave their old cows. Or rather old girlfriends. Now the premise sounds just like a gussied-up variation on one of Grandmas favorite sayings ""Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?"" But Someone Like You based on the novel Animal Husbandry by Laura Zigman prides itself on milking the obvious while examining its heroines lack of a satisfying love life. Judd who is a talent booker for a confrontational tabloid-TV talk show hosted by Ellen Barkin (looking more than ever like Angie Dickinson after a rough night) tests her hypothesis on two co-workers. Greg Kinnears Mr. Slick seems a perfect match even though he already has a steady and is played by a guy who used to smarm his way through Talk Soup. Meanwhile Judds platonic roommate Hugh Jackman (whose Wolverine put the sex in X-Men) is a Mr. Jerk who prides himself on being an obnoxious stud muffin. Big problem. Jackman is miscast. He never seems that awful not even with a constant parade of half-naked honeys going in and out of his bedroom. He practically has ""prime beef"" stamped on his forehead. But it takes Judd a lot longer to see it than the audience. Instead after Kinnear dumps her -- big shock -- she gets revenge by writing a column for a mens magazine under a pseudonym and based on her cow thesis that becomes a pop sensation. How very Sex and the City of her. Eventually Judd comes to the same conclusion that moviegoers will have arrived at ages ago. That she is to blame for her own romantic woes which she confesses in a clumsy Tootsie-style climax (minus the cross-dressing). One senses that director Tony Goldwyn who displayed a surer hand with matters of the heart in A Walk on the Moon knows his movie is a little lifeless. So he tosses in several awkward gimmicks placing title sequences between scenes (such as ""Establishment of Intimacy"" and ""Vocalization of Emotions"") and having Judds TV talk back to her. They fall flat too. Speaking of flat somebody probably has a beast-inspired theory about how two gorgeous stars like Judd and Jackman could fail to spark cinematic heat even when they prance around in skimpy undies and slurp Chinese noodles seductively. But personally Im in no mood for such bull.

Starring Ashley Judd Greg Kinnear Hugh Jackman and Marisa Tomei. Directed by Tony Goldwyn. (PG-13. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . ""Someone Like You"" tries to be clever but it doesnt make it. Its a romantic comedy with insights into sex and relationships that are old and obvious. The picture stars Ashley Judd as Jane a producer for a morning talk show. One day a colleague (Hugh Jackman) introduces her to the shows brand-new executive producer Ray (Greg Kinnear) and she likes him on sight. Within days she and Ray are sharing that most intimate thing in movies the romantic montage in which theyre shown in rapid succession walking together laughing drinking coffee out of big cups and kissing. All that is fine. Kinnear was made for this kind of romantic comedy and its nice to see Judd happy for once. Sure one might question how on earth a TV producer could fall in love with an executive producer. The usual reaction to a new boss in television is paranoia. But hey its a comedy. The movie begins to derail however when Ray refusing to leave his old girlfriend dumps Jane. This happens early and the rest of the movie involves her attempts to recover. One way she recovers is to research the mating behavior of other male animals especially bulls. Ultimately Janes intensive research leads her to a startling discovery Men like variety. Men like to have sex with lots of women. Jane is obviously a genius. Startled by her insight she spills it in one excited gush to her girlfriend Liz (Marisa Tomei) who works for a mens magazine. Professional that she is Liz thinks Jane might be on to something. In fact Liz is so impressed by the originality of Janes powers of observation that she gives her a column in the magazine. As for the readers? Theyve never heard such truths. Jane writes one article and the next day she is syndicated in 300 newspapers. We wont quibble over how it could work to have a once-a-month magazine column syndicated in daily newspapers. Put that aside. This movie has real problems. Namely Jane is a drip. If she werent played by Judd shed seem like a drip. As it stands shes just no fun always talking about cows and bulls and which woman is ""the new cow"" and which is ""the old cow."" Another problem is just in the nature of romantic comedies. The viewer always knows the heroine has to end up with somebody and it has to be one of the characters we already know. In real life the woman might go to Club Med or something but in a movie her choices are limited. That limitation is fine when its Katharine Hepburn having to choose between Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart. But in ""Somebody Like You"" Janes possibilities are wretched. Hugh Jackman as Janes friend Eddie is a slut whos in bed with a different woman every night. And the ex-boyfriend played by Kinnear is weak. In the end the only pleasure to be had is in watching Ellen Barkin who plays the talk-show host and Tomei. But these two forceful funny and underused actresses really should be playing leads. . This film contains sexual situations.

Judd Jackman excel RELATED SITES By Paul TataraCNN Reviewer (CNN) -- Heres some unexpected good news Ashley Judd is finally on the right track. Her new movie the romantic comedy ""Someone Like You"" suffers from the usual pitfalls of an over-investigated genre. But its an enjoyable pastry of a film that for the first time in years shows off Judds considerable talents to full effect. Though ""Double Jeopardy""s (1999) broad-stroke silliness cemented her status as a movie star she proves herself to be a formidable comic actress this time around. Think Mary Tyler Moore but with less overt whining and even better legs. Judd plays Jane Goodale a disillusioned Manhattan talk show producer who likes to compare modern romance to the mating habits of cows. (""Someone Like You"" was originally called ""Animal Husbandry"" based on a novel of that title by Laura Zigman. That name changed when someone came up with the obligatory benign three-word title.) Jane is having trouble finding a boyfriend but one day her apparent Prince Charming Ray Brown (Greg Kinnear) comes strolling into the office. Ray is the new executive producer of the talk show which is hosted by the power-hungry Diane Roberts (Ellen Barkin). Love and a lease Soon Ray leaves his longtime girlfriend for Jane and her noticeably tight designer outfits. The two lovebirds decide to move in together and they even land a nice apartment with a great view of the city. Then just when theyre ready to sign the lease Ray backs out of the relationship. Janes current apartment has already been rented to a new tenant so shes forced to room with Eddie (Hugh Jackman) a handsome openly womanizing co-worker. This gives her an opportunity to more closely scrutinize the male of the species. Her various conclusions are relayed to the audience via sometimes amusing voiceovers ... with the emphasis placed squarely on ""sometimes.""

(Twentieth Century Fox) Mere minutes into ""Someone Like You"" its obvious how things are going to turn out. In terms of who ends up with whom I mean. If an earnest likable woman (Ashley Judd) has started going out with a shifty-eyed work associate played by an actor who has played a slippery customer in other movies (Greg Kinnear) and if she spends much of her time talking about this affair and the relationships between men and women with her good-looking gym-buffed always-ready-to-talk-about-sensitive-issues roommate (Hugh Jackman) where do you think this storys going to go? Jane Goodale (Judd) works as a talent booker for a popular TV talk show. The host is the prima-donna-ish Diane Roberts (Ellen Barkin) a transparent satirical version of Diane Sawyer whos always looking for the exclusive story. When the shows new executive producer Ray Brown (Kinnear) becomes interested in Jane she is bowled over. Their hush-hush romance catches fire they find a great place in the city then Ray gets cold feet. Jane who has already given away her precious apartment suddenly needs a place. She rooms with co-worker Eddie (Jackman) and the movie shifts into conventional cruise control. Oh this romance directed by Tony Goldwyn pretends that Jane and her roomie Eddie (Jackman) are diametrically opposed because she believes in love and he believes in one-night stands. But if they werent destined for each other Eddie would be a nerd sporting coke-bottle specs or gay or monstrously overweight - some obviously ineligible candidate. ""Someone Like You"" goes off on an oh-so-precious tangent when Jane adopts a pseudonym and writes a provocative article that compares male mating behavior unfavorably to that of bulls. When the article makes waves Diane demands to book the mysterious author putting Jane in a quandary. Meanwhile the friendship between Jane and Eddie is getting hotter and hotter. Heaven forbid a Hollywood romantic movie have any narrative surprises. Which leaves us with these globally significant questions Is the movie cute? Is Judd adorable? Is Jackman hunky? Is the story watchable or amusing or fun? Thats an easy call If your standards are so elastic that theres almost nothing that could turn you off the answer is probably yes. But if you are allergic to predictability and second-rate cuteness or watching Marisa Tomei playing second fiddle as Judds one-dimensional quippy friend Id advise you to catch up with me Im the guy frantically running away from this forgettable affair. ""Someone Like You"" (PG-13 94 minutes) - Contains sexual situations some profanity.

Its a brain boggling theory one so revolutionary that Im not even going to reveal it until halfway through this review. Jane who works as a New York talent booker for a TV talk show developed her theory after having a fling with Ray (Greg Kinnear) the programs handsome new executive producer who happened to be in the midst of a relationship with somebody else. Overnight Jane and Ray became smitten. Ray even uttered the L word and asked Jane to move in with him. But then he cut off the affair and scotched the cohabitation plan - this despite the fact that Jane had told her landlord she was leaving her apartment (the Manhattan equivalent of a blood oath). Okay now Im ready to reveal the theory. Having been dumped in this cruel manner Jane has come to the enlightened conclusion that men are like bulls and women are like cows. A man you see having sated his desire to mate with a ""new cow"" will inevitably abandon that same woman who is now an ""old cow."" Men are driven that is to say by ""the biological urge to spread their seed."" Stop the presses. Phone the editors of Cosmo and Maxim. Tell Carrie Bradshaw the news. The new cow/old cow dithering of ""Someone Like You"" is indeed the films idea of a ""Sex and the City"" conceit but on that infinitely superior show the anthropomorphic cuteness would have been treated in a few quippy voice overs. Here its the masochistic heart of the movie complete with illustrative footage of actual cows (not sexy) and a mystery alter ego plot in which Jane writing under the alias of a white bun haired ""Ph.D."" named Dr. Marie Charles channels her theory into a mens magazine where her friend (Marisa Tomei) is an editor. The theory catapults ""Dr. Marie"" to stardom making her a cult guru on the Oprah circuit. Meanwhile poor Jane is miserable with no romantic prospects in all of New York but apparently the two biggest cads at work Ray who keeps hitting on her despite their messy history and Eddie (Hugh Jackman) a commitment phobic stud whose loft Jane moves into after losing her own apartment. Heres another theory Ashley Judd Marisa Tomei and Sandra Bullock have become the same person. In film after film all three portray the postfeminist diva waif that cuddly urban neurotic with sensible brown hair and a kind of topsy turvy pixie yuppie exhibitionism (think Doris Day in the land of Victorias Secret) each of them desperate in every scene to look as adorable as she does vulnerable. In ""Someone Like You"" Judd plays a ""career gal"" but really what she does is this She beams she broods she sniffles she throws a tantrum she does a high school cheerleader routine. Jackman out from under his Wolverine facial hair has a terse light charm but ""Someone Like You"" is the very definition of innocuous. It was originally called ""Animal Husbandry"" and while the producers were throwing away that title they might have done well to chuck the movie along with it.
