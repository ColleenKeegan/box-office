Say again?? As weird as anything penned by Charlie Kaufman talkier than a Rohmer more burned up over big zeitgeist shit than Magnolia this feverish state-of-the-split-nation address finds Russell tossing everything that matters - and more - into the pot and producing a pretty indigestible and very messy stew. If his hearts in the right place his brain is busy working overtime; trouble is with so many ideas squeezed into under two hours the characters remain cartoon-thin while good gags are even thinner on the ground.The efforts of activist Albert (Jason Schwartzman) to save a local wetland from the expanding Huckabees shopping centre are undermined not only by three mysterious sightings of a tall African - which prompts him to hire existential investigators Vivian and Bernard Jaffe (Lily Tomlin Dustin Hoffman) - but by Brad Stand (Jude Law) a Huckabees junior exec gunning for a promotion with his efforts to provide the company with an environment-friendly image. The Jaffes unusually intrusive regime leads Albert to encounter Tommy (Mark Wahlberg) a volatile firefighter unsettled by that big September thing who also has a lot of time for the Jaffes nihilist rival Caterine Vauban (Isabelle Huppert) and it turns out for Brads girl Dawn (Naomi Watts) who just happens to be Miss Huckabees...Confused? Its likely you will be. Some love this film and it does deserve praise for its ambition erudition audacity and antipathy to certain aspects of Bush-era America. But the frenzied philosophising forced wackiness dense dialogue packed narrative and full-on acting - Wahlberg Watts Tomlin and Hoffman nearly get it right Schwartzmans barely there Hupperts wasted the rest middling - leave insufficient room for nuanced reaction or thought. As for laughter...

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

""I  Huckabees"" is a movie-length riff about connections a comedy about people striving to find the hidden structure of a seemingly structureless universe. Everyone in the movie is pursuing a dream and the dream is to find the right way to live -- whether its to be glamorous or moral or wealthy or wise. This faith in the possibility of perfection is traditionally American but the loneliness that drives the people feels new. At its emotional core ""I  Huckabees"" is really about a certain disconnectedness at the heart of modern American life. To explain the movie accurately is inevitably to sound vague. Like the characters director and co-writer David O. Russell (""Three Kings"") is flailing in search of meaning. He grabs at everything and sometimes comes up empty. But to write off ""Huckabees"" as a mishmash of zany characters and half- thought ideas would be wrong. This is a high dive into the creative waterfall a risky foolish intelligent comedy that acknowledges with neither irony nor mawkishness the spiritual pain of living in these times. Huckabees the films central metaphor is a discount department store that is rapidly expanding and doing its part to turn America into a strip mall. Little girls in Third World countries were told go blind working in factories in order to supply Huckabees production line. To shop at Huckabees is to blind oneself to injustice. Thus average people are faced with an unattractive choice. They can know the truth and live in a state of paranoia guilt and paralysis. Or they can choose ignorance and exist inside a bright lie that would almost be perfect if only it were a little more convincing. The action of the film involves an effort by an environmentalist group led by a young activist Albert (Jason Schwartzman) to prevent Huckabees from expanding into a nearby marsh. It also involves an investigation of a more personal nature. Albert hires a pair of ""existential detectives"" -- played by Lily Tomlin and Dustin Hoffman -- to follow him around and diagnose his emotional ills. He doesnt quite know what his problem is but he knows something is wrong. Hoffman and Tomlin are a delight. He is deadpan and reassuring tough love in a 1960s Sonny Bono haircut and Tomlin is infinitely peaceful to the point that one suspects she must be crazy. They preach the interconnectedness of all things We are all one and so whatever happens is OK. Their nemesis is Caterine a cool French nihilist played with deadpan aplomb by Isabelle Huppert. She teaches that nothing is connected to anything and that life is simply chaos. A firefighter with post-Sept. 11 stress comes under Caterines spell and next thing he knows hes obsessing about the effects of petroleum. As played by Mark Wahlberg the firefighter exudes a visceral suffering bordering on a kind of madness. Burly and bewildered hes a simple guy thrust into the deep waters of the spirit and its disorders. Wahlberg essentially playing Americas troubled soul is perfect in his part and assured of his tone. What the firefighter knows is what the other characters find out Sooner or later something cataclysmic happens to make people search for deeper answers. Jude Law as Brad the golden boy Huckabees executive who poses as an environmentalist seems to have an enviable life with a nice house and a girlfriend Dawn (Naomi Watts) whos the companys national spokeswoman. But Dawns inner life is nothing but an infantile wail of need and the two are like children. The shiny surface masks a loveless relationship between two beautiful narcissists frozen with fear. At times the movies message seems to be that if people follow their feelings a healing will follow for themselves and the universe. But ""Huckabees"" is more complicated than that. In fact watching it is rather like being trapped in a fugue of contradictory thoughts and concerns. Thematically the movie remains unresolved but perhaps for that reason its haunting and in any case the search is honest. For example the movie introduces a Sudanese refugee who works as a doorman in America. To him Huckabees is a paradise. In his way hes right. So it doesnt really matter if ""I  Huckabees"" doesnt quite hit the bulls-eye. Theres ambition here as well as a shaggy brilliance and a rare willingness on the part of a director to work out his questions in front of us on film. Russell trusts the striving for meaning and he trusts that others will find it interesting. His trust is not misplaced. -- Advisory Strong language and a sex scene.

""No. Hes calling it an existential comedy."" The sad thing is David O. Russell went ahead and made that movie. And indeed Albert Markovski (Jason Schwartzman) does pay a visit to ""existential"" detectives Bernard and Vivian Jaffe (Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin). Hes a green activist who likes to plant trees in the center of corporate parking lots. Hes currently fighting to protect a marshland habitat from company executive Brad Stand (Jude Law) who wants to build yet another of his Huckabees superstores. But in the midst of this consuming activity he has run into a tall African a doorman on three separate occasions. This seems to be more than coincidence. And it seems to tie in with his concerns about life the universe everything. Hes troubled. He needs existential detectives. Albert discovers to his horror that the Jaffes like to take the holistic approach. Theyre always looking for the big picture Bernard insists. This means putting Albert into a black sense-deprivation bag where he can confront his demons. It also means poking through Alberts trash observing Albert at breakfast from his roof (and feverishly taking notes) investigating his circles of friends and enemies and basically examining everything. Meanwhile Brad gets wind of Alberts contract with the detectives and decides to hire them as well; its all part of a convoluted scheme he has in mind. Hes also planning to dump his girlfriend and company spokesmodel Dawn (Naomi Watts) for a younger model. Also factoring in the scattered story lines are Tommy Corn (Mark Wahlberg) a firefighter who has become radicalized by the worlds consumerism and dependence on oil ever since ""the big September thing"" and French philosopher Caterine Vauban (Isabelle Huppert) who sees randomness where the Jaffes see connectedness. It sounds like a Wes Anderson movie. But Russell (who made ""Spanking the Monkey"" ""Flirting With Disaster"" and ""Three Kings"" all terrific in different ways) and co-writer Jeff Baena lack Andersons effortlessly smart wit. Theirs is too painfully forced from the movies thin premise to its ideas about whats funny Hoffman in a Beatles wig? Furthermore theres no one to care about. Albert fizzles around like someone short of his meds the Jaffes are a pair of writers conceits more than characters; Wahlberg Watts and Law seem to be in the movie merely to add marquee value; and Huppert looks lost as if she wandered into this story by accident. The movies satirical tweaking of New Age thinking and other philosophical mumbo jumbo and its trendy post9/11 commentary dont deepen things or make them funny. They just suck the air out of the movies premise -- whatever that may be. In a way theres something admirably pure about this film. It doesnt mess around in the middle zone of mediocrity. Its uncompromisingly bad single-mindedly off-target. And youre either going to hate this thing or well I dont even want to finish that thought.

More than anything hes haunted by the mocking face of his arch-rival the corporate golden boy Brad Stand. And for all his granola politics hes nursing a nascent rage.

Is human suffering inevitable? Is this all there is? This being a comedy and one directed by the quirkily quixotic David O. Russell (""Flirting with Disaster"" ""Three Kings"") Albert has access to something that non-movie mortals dont the unusually devoted attention of Bernard and Vivian (Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin) a pair of married ""existential detectives."" Their business as stated on their business cards ""Crisis Intervention and Resolution."" They may claim to traffic in existentialism but their approach -- ""Everything is connected"" -- is more akin to the beatific Buddha than to the cynical Sartre. Theyve taken on Alberts case pro bono with a warning that theyll be spying on every and they do mean every aspect of his miserable little life from his flagging career as an environmentalist -- which threatens to be eviscerated by the dreaded Brad (Jude Law satirizing his pretty-boy persona) a rising star at the megastore Huckabees -- to his relationship with his distant mother (Talia Shire) to his nonexistent sex life. And they make head-scratching pronouncements ""If you floss or masturbate"" Vivian tells him somberly ""that could be the key to your entire reality."" Of course this slavish devotion to detail has all sorts of embarrassing and hilarious consequences for the adenoidal Albert played to Woody Allenesque perfection by Jason Schwartzman (Shires son in real life too and best known for ""Rushmore"") as he tries to find his ultimate reality -- and the riddle of that ""tall African guy"" who keeps cropping up front and center in his life. Like ""Flirting With Disaster"" this is a road movie although the terrain traveled is an interior one. (To underscore this Alberts everyday life is filmed in bright generic suburban Los Angeles hues while his internal musings are lushly surreal images that bring to mind Magritte and Dali.) Every road movie has its loyal sidekick and in that Albert is paired up with attitudinal Tommy (Mark Wahlberg) a firefighter whose existential conflict and obsession with fossil fuel consumption has caused his wife to show him the door. ""Once you realize the universe sucks"" Tommy tells him ""youve got nothing to lose."" On the road to self-awareness they meet up with sexy Caterine (Isabelle Huppert) the nihilistic French philosopher and foe to Vivian and Bernard her onetime mentors who urges them to embrace their dark side since life is a big ole nothing anyway; and the ditzy Dawn (Naomi Watts) the bikini-clad Huckabees spokesmodel who ditches Brad once she discovers Amish bonnets overalls and her inner Simone de Beauvoir. Ultimately ""I  Huckabees"" is an allegory. There is a plot of sorts in that there is a conflict (will Albert rescue his career from the clutches of the evil Brad?) and a resolution. But ""I  Huckabees"" rambles along at its own good-natured pace tossing out ideas like Santa ditching dump trucks at Christmas. Indeed Russells not afraid to take on weighty topics existentialism vs. nihilism meaning vs. nothingness Christianity suburban sprawl the deification of firefighters post-9/11 and all things Shania. As in Shania Twain. As with ""Three Kings"" Russells treatise on the Gulf War ""I  Huckabees"" has a political bent served with a heavy dollop of humor. His politics definitely steer left of center; the laughs keep this from turning into mush. ""I  Huckabees"" is a hot or cold affair Youll either double over or quickly grow impatient with its self-indulgent navel-gazing. But with razor-sharp performances zingy one-liners broad slapstick humor and a message of sorts theres enough to distract the viewer from becoming hopelessly lost in the lint-filled chaos that is the umbilicus. I  Huckabees (104 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for profanity nudity and brief sex scenes.

Russells perplexing but beguiling comedy ""I [Heart] Huckabees"" we see a young activist named Albert Markovski jogging through a labyrinth of halls in an office building turning seemingly random corners making his way through a maze where the destination seems indistinguishable from the journey. Thats the movie in a nutshell it keeps turning corners and zipping along and you never know quite where its going. But for those who attend without an agenda (and those comfortable with talky philosophy-flavored ambiguity) the journey has its own rewards. The plots not easily summarized but lets try Albert (Jason Schwartzman of ""Rushmore"") an environmentalist struggling for answers about life hires a married pair of existential detectives (Lily Tomlin Dustin Hoffman) to examine his life. Despite competition from their nemesis a fierce-looking French philosopher (Isabelle Huppert) whose business card reads ""cruelty manipulation meaninglessness"" they launch into a complicated investigation involving Alberts perpetual competition with corporate golden boy Brad Stand (Jude Law) who works for the superstore chain Huckabees. Soon Brads life along with that of his Huckabees spokesmodel girlfriend Dawn (Naomi Watts) is under the microscope as is that of disillusioned firefighter Tommy (Mark Wahlberg). Movie review Showtimes and trailer  ""I [Heart] Huckabees"" with Dustin Hoffman Isabelle Huppert Jude Law Jason Schwartzman Lily Tomlin Mark Wahlberg Naomi Watts. Directed by David O. Russell from a screenplay by Russell and Jeff Baena. 105 minutes. Rated R for language and a sex scene. Several theaters. Russell the gifted director of ""Spanking the Monkey"" ""Flirting with Disaster"" and ""Three Kings"" is clearly in an existential mood here -- this screwy screwball is filled with lines like ""You cant deal with my infinite nature"" ""He called with his own existential conundrum"" and ""Have you ever transcended time and space?"" (To the latter an anxious Albert bluffs ""Time not space."") Characters discuss matter theory a choir sings about nothingness and sometimes even the screen trances out splitting into little frames randomly floating. All of this is a surprising amount of fun thanks to the zippy energy with which Russell imbues the film. He doesnt give us much space in which to wonder whether its all making sense (it didnt for me at least not on a first viewing) but he shows us such a good time that it doesnt much matter. And hes assembled a marvelous company of actors -- each playing a character on the edge and each seemingly having a blast. The melancholic Schwartzman with his caterpillar brows and pale determined face makes a perfect on-screen opposite to Law a tanned and dazzling fellow whos so content he practically bursts into song at meetings. Hoffman so loose he almost seems to be improvising sports a Beatles haircut and a beatific smile; a black-clad Tomlin purrs throatily alongside him looking ready to transcend his (or Alberts) personal space anytime. Wahlberg and Law though their characters have less screen time both project genuine sweetness. And Huppert looking hungry and slightly dangerous is the dark cloud floating above it all. Asked a frantic question she answers ""Yes. No"" without affect; the very personification of all and nothing. ""I [Heart] Huckabees"" after careening in and out of control through its running time finally fades out quite literally as form becomes indistinctiveness and everyone becomes the same. I dont quite know what the point of it all was but I do know that I enjoyed watching it. Its an experiment unfolding before our eyes and as such its refreshing -- a merry lurch through lifes meaning a dance on the head of a pin.

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

"I hate Huckabees. Slate Sign In Sign Up I hate Huckabees. I hate Huckabees. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 1 2004 614 PM I Hate Huckabees But I still heart David O. Russell. By David Edelstein Still looking for one good review David O. Russells I Heart Huckabees (Fox Searchlight) is a rambunctious intellectual ensemble farce in which a group of disparate people cogitate frantically about the interconnectedness of all things. Its not exactly common for an American filmmaker to tackle that subject head-on sans irony; I can think of no comparable film--certainly no comparable American film although its Preston Sturges-like hustle and its characters New Agey earnestness mark it clearly as a weave of New York and Los Angeles sensibilities. No its sui generis a breathlessly original--almost free-associational--work that seamlessly mixes high and low comedy that makes sport of its characters narcissistic contortions and yet treats their existential confusion with civilized respect. Russell is a manically inventive writer-director--maybe the most fearless talent of his generation. Its not a contradiction to say that I admire him more than ever while pronouncing Huckabees an unmitigated disaster. The movie begins with its hero Albert Markovski (Jason Schwartzman) uttering a string of expletives as he paces around a patch of marshland. In the midst of a fight to protect this natural resource from being leveled by the Huckabees Corp. (its a chain of Wal-Mart-like department stores) Albert is distracted by a series of coincidences and engages a pair of ""existential detectives"" Vivian (Lily Tomlin) and Bernard (Dustin Hoffman) to explain their meaning. The rumpled Bernard tells him that all matter in the universe is interchangeable that everyone and everything is part of the same existential blanket. (For this purpose he produces an actual blanket; also as he talks squares from his and Alberts faces drift out into the air hang for a bit then drop to the ground.) Another of the detectives clients the rabidly antipetroleum firefighter Tommy (Mark Wahlberg) has discovered a competing philosophy via Vivian and Bernards dialectical opposite Catherine Vauban (Isabelle Huppert) a leggy French nihilist who slinks after Albert tossing her auburn locks and attempting to convince him too that all connections are illusory and that the universe consists of cruelty and nothingness (or more precisely nossingness). Drawn into this philosophical swamp as well are Alberts yuppie Huckabees antagonist Brad (Jude Law) and Brads girlfriend and the blond spokesmodel for Hucakbees Dawn (Naomi Watts) who uglies herself up in search of her true identity. Advertisement The above makes Huckabees sound clotted with talk but the picture moves fast--maybe too fast. Tomlins Viv gabbles madly and leaps in and out of cars and windows while hordes of bit players--Huckabees execs environmental activists firemen--dash in and out of the frame. Alberts meditations lapse into fantasies of death and dismemberment and someone must have had a great time at the computer pixelating people and whacking off their heads. The playfulness--computer trickery flashbacks split-screens jump-cuts--is engaging for a while but the narrative begins to suffer from a similar kind of attention deficit disorder and the movie has zero emotional weight. The ostensible protagonist--with his longish hair and pinched face Schwartzman is a perfect cross between Russell and Tom Cruise--recedes while Brad and Dawn inexplicably (and uninterestingly) move into the foreground. Youre aware of Russell madly pumping helium into this great zeppelin but the thing is just too overloaded (and inelegant and ineptly designed) to float. Huckabees has a rare Jon Brion funhouse score that isnt any fun Its melodically thin and circular--it underlines everything emotionally hollow and fatuous in the writing. I wish I could say that the great cast keeps Huckabees afloat but most of the acting is cringe-worthy. With his granny glasses and mussed jacket and Ringo haircut Hoffman has a wonderful gnomish intellectual affect but his performance is all nattery autopilot and Law and Watts end up mugging like crazy with the camera in too close. Its great to see Tomlin so prominent and shes a terrific physical comedian but her face is a mask. (Whether by design or surgery I cant say.) Only Mark Wahlberg has a personal triumph. The role was written for him and Russell has a real understanding of the way his dopey sweetness goes hand-in-boxing-glove with his volatility. Its difficult to know what went so disastrously wrong with I Heart Huckabees (even that title is a nonstarter) but I suspect it was dead from its inception. Russell has Buddhist leanings (he goes on about dharma and meditates ostentatiously) but hes also known as a difficult guy especially on his sets Someone who worked high up on one of his films told me the crew referred to him as ""David O. Asshole."" When I interviewed him last year for an article on Three Kings (1999) I found him smart and likably feverish if a tad on the delusional-paranoid side--but then I think you cut a talent like Russells a lot of slack. I bring up Russells personality because I think Huckabees is an attempt to get to the heart of his temperamental instability--to reconcile his Buddhist yearning for oneness with his pugnacious impulse to scream and throttle people. And the movie fails Im convinced because it approaches the problem philosophically instead of psychologically. The only scene that has any emotional heft is the one in which Albert confronts his overbearing but icy mom (Talia Shire Schwartzmans actual mother) with the French nihilist on hand to point out that Albert was ""orphaned by indifference."" Its weird that for all the babbling about interconnectedness and the Sartrean interlocutor the key scene in Huckabees is set squarely in Freud--and Alice Miller--country. Russell was much closer to the nerve in his primal-scream screwball comedy Flirting With Disaster (1996)--a major work of infantile rage. I Heart Huckabees is ostensibly more grown-up but so fatally overintellectualized that it never finds its focus. Nothing is connected indeed. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Russell who appears to have spent much of his time goading his actors into a state of hysteria that brought at least one of the movies stars Lily Tomlin to the brink of collapse. Russell recently got Buddhism which in Hollywood can be an ominous portent of major flip-out. Still he must have been doing something right. For all the reported mayhem the finished product turns out to be a fresh buoyant mischievous and rather jolly meditation -- if thats the word for a movie as divinely nuts as this one is -- on the meaning of life in an unhappy world. Undisciplined teeming with big thoughts and overplotted unto exhaustion Huckabees is a bitch to review but tremendous fun to watch. When first we meet Albert Markovski (Jason Schwartzman) the ill-coiffed president of a sparsely membered organization of tree-huggers hes rushing along muttering the fearful enraged and paranoid nothings that buzz like gnats in most peoples heads. Like the rest of us Albert is mired in the vicissitudes of everyday life while wondering if theres some larger story to give significance to the agony. Obsessed with a series of apparent coincidences involving a tall Sudanese doorman (The Lost Boys of the Sudans Ger Duany) Albert hires Bernard and Vivian Jaffe a married pair of ""existential detectives"" to comb through his life in search of metaphysical enlightenment. This is an idea as inspired as it is insane Think how wonderful it would be to have a pair of optimistic neo-Buddhists -- especially as sweet and goofy and improbable a couple as Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin -- tailing you night and day sorting the wheat in your life from the chaff and nudging you to rise above quotidian reality and look at the big picture. For Albert though things get messy when Bernard and Vivian are hired away by his nemesis Brad (Jude Law slick and golden and oozing sleaze) a corporate image-maker whos trying to take over Alberts organization as part of a public-relations campaign for his employer the low-end Huckabee department-store chain. And when Bernard and Vivians opposite number a French-nihilist author of the self-help book If Not Now (played by Isabelle Huppert sexy as ever but palpably ill at ease with English dialogue) shows up to play the gloom-and-doom card Albert is only the first to begin unraveling. More craftily structured than it might seem amid all this ruckus Huckabees is held together -- just -- by the very polarities it embraces Being and Nothingness universal interconnectedness versus the essential aloneness of the individual idealism versus careerism. Theres nothing particularly deep or new about the formulation -- every yoga-practicing Tibet-loving kabbalah-plundering macher in Hollywood has that much philosophy under his belt these days. But I like the way Russell sticks his neck out tethering the metaphysical pingpong to his disgust about the handling of 9/11 corporate tyranny and even the bimbo-ization of women. Mark Wahlberg is funny and touching as a firefighter enraged by his countrys willingness to do anything for foreign oil and Naomi Watts is lively and game as Huckabees perky leggy corporate mascot who sees the light and ends up in baggy overalls and an Amish bonnet. Theres a way in which Russells work is kin to that of other youngish filmmakers like Richard Linklater Wes Anderson Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman whose movies are also precariously built energetically confused states of mind often with only the most tenuous connection to narrative coherence. I like their ambition and the way one thing seems to tumble after another in their fractured disorganized movies much as they do in life. And I like their bemused neurotic and thoroughly American insistence on the right to be happy. Just about everyone in I  Huckabees ends up melting down and emerging the better for it including Albert the very prototype of the dorky immovable new American dissident to whom Russell tips his hat. Im willing to bet he is one himself. I  HUCKABEES | Directed by DAVID O.

Russells new film I Heart Huckabees as ""an existential comedy"" is fairly problematic After all Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus werent exactly laugh riots. Ecology vs. corporate greed Dustin Hoffman and Mark Wahlberg. Fox Searchlight Pictures It does however point to the unbridled ambition that Russell -- who seems as much highwire artist as filmmaker -- brings to this film which does no less than try to divine the interconnectedness in a random universe and the beauty in arbitrary cruelty. (Related video Watch the I Heart Huckabees trailer) That he doesnt succeed hardly seems a knock. Really who could? And though many will leave the film bewildered or exasperated at some point viewers will be challenged or inspired. One must give Russell credit simply for trying to tackle such weightiness with a camera and Hollywood actors. In keeping with Huckabees sense of randomness the movie features an assortment of quirky characters all in search of the meaning of life Jason Schwartzman as an earnest environmentalist; Jude Law as a crass executive at the Huckabees superstores; Naomi Watts as his Barbie-like spokesmodel girlfriend; Mark Wahlberg as a recently dumped firefighter; and Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin as the quartets metaphysical private eyes investigating what answers will put these troubled souls at peace. Isabelle Huppert plays a rival guru to the more touchy-feely Hoffman and Tomlin. About the movie I Heart Huckabees   1/2 (out of four) Stars Jason Schwartzman Dustin Hoffman Lily Tomlin Jude Law Naomi Watts Director David O. Russell Distributor Fox Searchlight Pictures Rated R for language and a sex scene Opens Friday nationwide It has been five years (a near-lifetime in Hollywood) since Russell made a movie. His Three Kings a smart and gritty film about the Persian Gulf War was one of the best movies of 1999. His offbeat Flirting With Disaster (1996) is one of the most original and consistently funny comedies of the past decade. In Huckabees he is working out a lot of his (and societys) key concerns environmentalism corporate culture materialistic greed and the arbitrary nature of human suffering. Had the story been less sprawling and frenetic it might have been profound. But what emerges is part screwball comedy absurdist farce social satire and earnest self-exploration. If it had the unwavering focus and clear-eyed vision of Russells previous two features I Heart Huckabees might have been brilliant.

"I Heart Huckabees | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; i-heart-huckabees ) I Heart Huckabees (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli After seeing two previews for David O. Russells I Heart Huckabees I had no idea what it was about. Now having seen the movie I still feel like Im on the outside looking in. I certainly realize why the preview is so obtuse. Theres no way that two minutes of snippets can begin to convey what this film is trying to do. In fact in order to understand whats going on you have to sit through all 105 minutes of the running time and thats an experience that will try the patience of many mainstream movie-goers. Its no exaggeration to say that this movie is not for everyone. What is Huckabees about? Four different individuals - an environmental activist Albert (Jason Schwartzman); a fireman Tommy (Mark Wahlberg); a TV commercial model Dawn (Naomi Watts); and a corporate hot-shot Brad (Jude Law) - employ new age philosophies in an attempt to bring meaning to their lives. The men and women peddling those philosophies are ""Existential Detectives"" Vivian and Bernard Jaffe (Lilly Tomlin and Dustin Hoffman) and their rival author Caterine Vauban (Isabelle Huppert). After a number of false starts enemies Albert and Brad who are fighting over how the department store Huckabees will use a tract of open space find common ground; and Dawn and Tommy discover new people to love. Viewed from a dramatic perspective Huckabees will have a lot of people scratching their heads. Where viewers get into trouble with this film is that they try to buy into its philosophical diatribe believing it to be offering some kind of profound truth. Sure theres an element of self-importance in the screenplay but Huckabees is first and foremost a satire of cinematic pretentiousness. And on top of that its occasionally just plain funny. Russell hasnt equaled the laugh-aloud quotient of Flirting with Disaster but the way he throws zingers at the audience creates enough offbeat moments of humor to make Huckabees worth seeing even by those who dont understand a thing that Hoffman Tomlin and Huppert are saying. Much of what appears on the surface to be deeply philosophical is in fact satirical. Huckabees does present a pair of competing life views - that everything is interconnected or that truth is derived only through pain and isolation - but observes that in the case of these characters neither approach is more obviously effective. Russell is openly critical of those self-righteous individuals who believe their way is ""the"" way. Instead of espousing the bizarre existential doctrines of his characters he mocks them. If you dont understand all of the pseudo-psychological/philosophical mumbo-jumbo you havent missed the point. (If you do get everything you may need to seek professional help.) The performances are winning and there are some standout comedic vignettes. Consider for example the sight of Lily Tomlin and Dustin Hoffman sneaking around diving into garbage cans and being sprayed by a sprinkler. Tomlin may have done this sort of thing before but its not what one expects from an actor of Hoffmans stature or reputation. And he does it with a smile. Or theres the tongue-in-cheek cameo by Shania Twain who deserves some sort of ""good sport"" award for appearing after being subtly ridiculed throughout. Like all non-mainstream comedies Huckabees can be considered an acquired taste. Ill admit that a lot of people are going to describe it as a waste of time yet theres a likeability to the quirky characters that held my interest while tickling my funny bone.

Russell; Author Jeff Baena David O. Russell; Release Date Limited 10/01/2004; Release Date Wide 10/15/2004; Runtime (in minutes) 105; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Fox Searchlight Pictures Posted September 29 2004 -- 1200 AM EDT In I Heart Huckabees David O. Russells madly verbose metaphysical screwball comedy Albert Markovski (Jason Schwartzman) a stringy-haired environmentalist with a bit of an anger-management problem experiences one of those everyday coincidences that make you think Gee maybe there really is a hidden order to this thing called life. Alberts coincidence isnt all that dizzying He spies a spindly elegant-featured Sudanese man in three different places. Holy unity of existence Albert generally devotes his energy to righteous causes like planting trees in a mall parking lot. This particular coincidence though nags at him just enough to inspire him to retain the services of Bernard and Vivian Jaffe (Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin) a fuddy-duddy pair of ""existential detectives"" who are like personalized cosmic shrinks. They agree to show him the meaning of life. I Heart Huckabees is heady enough to be mistaken for one of the twisty-minded comedies of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman. In this case however that really would be a mistake What were dealing with is an exercise in faux-Kaufman reality bending. Russell the director of Three Kings and Spanking the Monkey cowrote the movies script with Jeff Baena and he has devised a lot of coy highfalutin banter thats every bit as ephemeral as soda-pop bubbles. The actors burp it out with a vengeance but they never become human beings we care about. As a madcap comedy of existence I Heart Huckabees is literally full of itself. Upon meeting Albert Bernard holds up a white blanket and pokes it to demonstrate the principle that ""everything is the same even if its different."" That sounds like a mystical dollop of promising insight and I kept waiting eagerly for the film to develop it. Could it mean for example that Albert and his hated rival Brad Stand (Jude Law) an amoral young sales executive in the Huckabees chain of retail superstores are really comrades under the skin? Or that our corporate selves arent our ""real"" selves? Or that Caterine Vauban (Isabelle Huppert) a sexy French philosopher whose nothing-matters nihilism marks her as the opposite of the Jaffes is actually their philosophical twin? At one point Bernard repeats his theory and thanks to some slip-sliding editorial tricks we see two peoples faces edge into each other to illustrate it. Yet it remains little more than an abstract nugget of pseudo-wisdom Everything is connected to everything else Alert the media. Hoffman in a graying bowl cut that makes him resemble a dowdy Sonny Bono delivers his flowery bromides with an enthusiasm thats infectious in its utter lack of irony. He clearly relishes the role of an ontological dweeb Buddhist whos so centered he sounds cracked (but is in fact utterly sane). He hawks enlightenment like a salesman out to give you the deal of a lifetime on cheap office furniture. Tomlin as his accomplice looks like an Avon lady in her troweled-on mascara and she matches Hoffman in old-school charm. These two are fun to watch long after weve figured out that like everyone else in I Heart Huckabees theyre babbling on about everything and nothing. From his first feature the incest comedy Spanking the Monkey David O. Russell has shown an insidious ability to spotlight his own edginess and he works that show-off cred to the max this time. Jason Schwartzman in his most prominent role since Rushmore runs around like a disheveled hippie prepster spouting conundrums in articulate hyperdrive. Schwartzman has grown more handsome with age but in this movie he suggests Tom Cruise body-snatched by the worlds most earnest talky and guilt-ridden grad student. Albert and the fellow designated by the Jaffes as his ""other"" a firefighter named Tommy (Mark Wahlberg) take turns pelting each other with a big red plastic ball to clear their identities. In the films idea of a love scene Albert and Caterine dunk each others faces in a puddle of dirty water. Oh the holy allegorical mud Did I mention that Naomi Watts plays a bendy-limbed Huckabees spokesmodel undergoing a crisis of conscience? What in the Buddhas name is going on in I Heart Huckabees? Russell has come up with a grab bag of ideas that dont stick with you because they dont stick together. Albert plumbing the meaning of existence is also on a crusade against suburban sprawl as he fights the paradise-paving ways of the Huckabees corporation. Call me dim but I never began to figure out what those two things have to do with one another. The tin-hearted Brad in his effort to portray Huckabees as an eco-friendly outfit has co-opted Alberts Open Spaces Coalition and made a phony PR show of the companys move to protect local wetlands (hes enlisted Shania Twain for the cause). The corporation you see is saving the marsh but not the woods around it. I dont know if this counts as a theory of higher unity but isnt a film that teases us with big ideas only to devolve into Hollywood environmental message mongering just doing its own version of saving the marsh?

Having revealed a taste for farce in ""Flirting With Disaster"" which traced a young mans search for his birth parents David O. Russell revisits the genre to track another young mans search for more abstract answers in ""I Heart Huckabees."" Clever but distancing this existential comedy bounces along on the backs of its tasty cast witty writing and stylistic verve. But the film inhabits an archly artificial realm making it largely an intellectual pleasure with a hollow core. A definite specialty item despite its more mainstream accoutrements the Fox Searchlight release nonetheless may tap pockets of ardent critical support to buoy its status among upscale fall releases. The group of young filmmakers that included Wes Anderson Alexander Payne Paul Thomas Anderson Spike Jonze and Russell as well as screenwriter Charlie Kaufman were collectively hailed a few years back as the new saviors of creatively moribund Hollywood. Since then it has become apparent just how much the group has in common. Intellectual and philosophical curiosity stylistic adventurousness brainy humor and a taste for absurdist eccentricity are all to some degree shared characteristics. Also central is a frequent fascination for driven oddballs whose individual missions cause them to chafe against the world around them. In most cases the slightly sagacious nature of those filmmakers work has been anchored by an accessible emotional heart -- the precocious prep-schoolers growing pains in Wes Andersons ""Rushmore""; the floundering fathers efforts to regain his familys trust in the same directors ""The Royal Tenenbaums""; the aching romance of Kaufmans (and director Michel Gondrys) ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."" ""I Heart Huckabees"" however is basically a hipster head trip about lifes big questions and as a result is a more rarefied entertainment. Eager to understand the deeper significance of coincidental encounters with the same man but also to get to the bottom of whats wrong with his life environmental activist and poet Albert Markovski (Jason Schwartzman) seeks professional help from Bernard and Vivian Jaffe (Dustin Hoffman Lily Tomlin) who run an existential detective agency. The bravura uninterrupted tracking shot that follows Albert through the maze-like corridors leading to the couples office sets the tone for the tortuous journey of enlightenment the Jaffes investigation unleashes. Despite instructions from Albert to stay clear of his work environment the Jaffes begin digging deep into both his private and professional life pushing him to accept his interconnectedness to all people and things. They identify the root of his problems in Brad Stand (Jude Law) an ambitious exec at retail chain Huckabees. Albert feels Brad has hijacked his Open Spaces Coalition for PR purposes after earlier announcing plans to build a mall on the marshland Alberts trying to protect. Brad throws a wrench into Alberts investigation however by hiring the Jaffes to look into his own life. This triggers a crisis with his girlfriend Huckabees spokesmodel Dawn (Naomi Watts) who overnight negates her coquette persona to explore her infinite nature swapping her bikini for dowdy Amish austerity. Unhappy with the course of his investigation and with Brads further intrusion into his life Albert teams with eco-crusading firefighter Tommy (Mark Wahlberg) another client of the Jaffes whos increasingly skeptical of their methods. He sways Albert to embrace the theories of French philosopher Caterine Vauban (Isabelle Huppert) a former protegee of the Jaffes who crossed over to the dark side of nihilist individualism. The Jaffes continue closing in on their clients unresolved issues while Caterine attacks their problems from another angle. Eventually the warring metaphysicians philosophies converge providing breakthroughs all round. While psychobabble can be a deadening element in any film co-screenwriters Russell and Jeff Baena keep the philosophical conundrums bouncing back and forth like a tennis match weighing lifes greater significance and purpose against emptiness and futility via a variety of neatly skewered schools of thought. Bernard Jaffes methods especially prompt some stylish visual devices in his use of tree-visualization therapy or when Albert slips into a body bag to exorcise his demons which appear in a collage of cutout images. Theres also a nod to quantum physical reality with particles and cubes literally shuffling and reforming as part of Alberts laborious dismantling process. Bernard is a surrealist thinker in thrall to Magritte a reference that seems to underline Bunuel as the films cinematic antecedent of choice. Whats missing perhaps is the heart of the films title or a character for the audience to invest in. But this is no fault of the cast. By far Schwartzmans most prominent role since debuting in ""Rushmore"" the actor again is quick-witted and appealing here playing an impassioned character whos far more neurotic and wired than his deadpan schoolboy in the earlier film. Law wryly plays up and then tears down his sleek golden-haired image uncovering the destabilizing anxiety and self-doubt beneath Brads dazzling charm. Watts is goofily amusing as the preening consumer kitten suddenly aware the joke was on her. Wahlberg (who worked with Russell in ""Three Kings"") makes Tommy an intense tough guy whos unrelenting in posing difficult questions. And Huppert drolly milks her haughty French allure for all its worth. The most enjoyable cast members however are Tomlin and Hoffman zinging off each other and off the still mutually adoring couples scholarly observations with obvious relish. For ""Flirting With Disaster"" alumna Tomlin especially hardboiled Vivians tireless sleuthing and knowing assessments represent the best use of the actress impeccable comic skills in years. A number of well-known faces turn up in minor roles including Jean Smart and an unbilled Richard Jenkins as adoptive parents of a Sudanese refugee; Tippi Hedren as a key Open Spaces member; ""Raising Victor Vargas"" granny Altagracia Guzman as a Spanish spiritualist; French thesp Said Taghmaoui as her translator; and pop-country star Shania Twain as the celebrity face of Brads wetlands campaign. Schwartzmans mother Talia Shire appears briefly with Bob Gunton as Alberts self-absorbed parents. Superbly crafted film is crisply shot in widescreen and clean colors by Peter Deming while K.K. Barretts production design favors stripped-down slightly sterile environments with occasional quirky touches. Mark Bridges injects plenty of personality into his costumes from Brads sharp suits to Dawns skimpy babewear and the snazzy retro-styled dresses worn by Vivian and Caterine. Perhaps the most pleasurable contribution is the almost saturation use of a lovely whimsical score by Jon Brion much of it based on his songs.
