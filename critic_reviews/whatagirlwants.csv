Amanda Bynes is a fish out of water in London in What a Girl Wants. It lacks Diaries exuberance but Girl does boast the likable presence of Nickelodeon star Amanda Bynes the suave charm of Colin Firth and a cute chaste romance with youthful hunk Oliver James. The story line and gags are predictable Daphne Reynolds (Bynes) a 17-year-old free spirit raised by her bohemian mother (Kelly Preston) goes to London to meet her father Lord Henry Dashwood (Firth) a prominent aristocrat running for public office. He had no idea that his short-lived marriage produced a child and has since gotten engaged to the ambitious daughter (Anna Chancellor) of his conniving political adviser (Jonathan Pryce). Daphne gets to know her father while coping with a snobby stepsister-to-be (Christina Cole) and with the myriad social obligations expected of her. Review of the movie What a Girl Wants ( out of four) Stars Amanda Bynes Colin Firth Oli Director Dennie Gordon Distributor Warner Bros. Rating PG for mild language Opens Friday nationwide The contrast between her rollicking American self and the tamped-down version she must become while in British society is so oversimplified that it likely will reinforce stereotypes for a youthful audience. The Brits are all stuffy unfashionable twits except for the adorable dark-eyed musician (James) whom Bynes falls for. His is the only character with some measure of depth. He tells Daphne ""Why fit in when you were born to stand out?"" Regarding English stereotypes there is a funny line from Daphnes grandmother (Eileen Atkins) who fends off Daphnes embrace with ""No hugs dear. Were British. We only show affection to horses and dogs."" Firths own inner rebel gets dusted off -- though it might be going a tad too far to show the dignified Firth rocking out and playing air guitar in skintight leather pants. Both Firth and Pryce deserve better material than their one-dimensional roles call for. Bynes efforts to be cute and endearing sometimes veer into mugging. In the movies finale there are echoes of yet another movie The Parent Trap in which two long-estranged parents reunite. This fits into the fantasies of many kids raised by single parents and contributes to Girls fairy-tale quality. Theres nothing wrong with fairy tales but they dont have to be formulaic. A movie like this would have benefited from a blending of the fanciful and the inventive.

Narrated by John Hurt . (Not rated. 60 minutes. At the Roxie.) The American government tacitly encouraged Saddam Hussein to invade Kuwait in 1990 then let him stay in power after the first Persian Gulf War so the United States could establish a long-term military presence in the region according to the documentary ""Hidden Wars of Desert Storm"" which claims U.S. officials lied repeatedly about their intentions during the first conflict. The issues raised may seem like old news given that U.S. troops are now in Iraq to depose Hussein but the pattern of alleged deception in the first imbroglio has disturbing relevance to this new war. Using historic footage and fresh interviews with scholars activists Arab leaders and other experts (including former U.N. weapons inspector Scott Ritter) ""Hidden Wars"" argues that in 1990 the United States sought to protect its oil interests in the Persian Gulf when it convinced the Saudi government (based on questionable evidence) that Husseins troops were a threat to Mecca. This may be the documentarys most serious charge though other allegations are also damning. For example ""Hidden Wars"" says that before the last war U.S. military leaders knowingly withheld information from U.S. troops about depleted uranium. The uranium was in U.S. munitions that destroyed Iraqi tanks and military vehicles -- vehicles that many U.S. troops touched. Documentarians Audrey Brohy and Gerard Ungerman devote the last part of their film to the U.S.-backed U.N. sanctions that many Iraqis blame for ruining their countrys infrastructure and health system. Brohy and Ungerman who have collaborated on documentaries since 1995 went back to Iraq before the latest war began apparently trying to update this film. As it is ""Hidden Wars"" has enough material to mull over as the current conflict enters a bloody new stage. -- Jonathan Curiel DYSFUNKTIONAL FAMILY Comedy concert. Starring Eddie Griffin. Directed by George Gallo. Written by Eddie Griffin. (R. 84 minutes. At the AMC 1000 Metreon and Century Daly City.) . Eddie Griffin hits the stage full tilt. He waves to the crowd cuts the music and hes off. No wonder they call him ""Fast Eddie."" Unfortunately weve seen this before. The pacing the leather suit the raspy speed rap. Chris Rock and others do it and as long as Griffin sticks with the shtick he doesnt have much to add. The only question is how long it will be before he says ""White people do some strange (stuff) dont they?"" Or explains that he constantly says the ""n-word"" because he is trying to rob it of its power. (Answer? Not long.) Griffin says his idol is Richard Pryor. In that case congratulations. Like Pryor Griffin is quick funny and militantly profane. Pryor wouldnt bend on his material which cost him mainstream acceptance but made him a comedy insider favorite. Griffin despite the head-shaking from his mother in the front row in the movie apparently isnt going to give in either. If thats true too bad because hes a talented guy. He doesnt have to compromise completely of course. Some of the raw bits in Robin Williams recent HBO special had parents leaping for the remote. But Williams knows how to play to both the big crowd and the niche audience. Griffin can do it too if he wants. The idea of this was supposed to be that it wasnt really a concert film. The best parts of his act and the inspiration for the title are his stories about growing up in Kansas City. There is Uncle Bucky the heroin addict and Uncle Curtis who invites the kids over to watch porn. The theory was to cut from the show to actual interviews with those characters but it never pays off. We hear that Uncle Curtis is a fascinating guy who actually loves movies like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" but all we see is him sitting in front of a porno flick saying ""heh heh heh."" Hes a bit like Fat Albert gone bad. You are going to hear more from Griffin. Hes already signed to play Sammy Davis Jr. in a movie and his impressions at the end of this concert only hint at where he can go with acting. And even the straightest arrow has to admit that some of his edgy stuff brings a smile. ""How many people have had their mom try to run them over with the car?"" Griffin asks at one point. Then he looks around in disbelief. ""Cmon now I cant be the only one."" -- C.W. Nevius CHAOS Drama. Starring Catherine Frot Vincent Lindon and Rachida Brakni. Directed by Coline Serreau. (Not rated. 109 minutes. In French with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters.) A well-off middle-aged couple is driving down a city street when a prostitute appears running for her life. She begs to get into the car; the husband flicks the automatic lock. And as the couple sit and watch the young womans pimps beat her into an insensate pulp. Later when the wife suggests they should have done something to help the girl the husband says ""What girl?"" Thus begins writer Coline Serreaus ""Chaos"" an effective French concoction that starts off like a thriller but keeps revealing different sides. Partly a satire of bourgeois dislocation and partly a feminist fantasy its a movie populated with various kinds of despicable and disappointing men -- from brutal pimps and criminal businessmen to a selfish son and an unloving husband. The husband (Vincent Lindon) and wife (Catherine Frot) live lives that require them to rush everywhere and their busyness causes them to regard each others presence as a kind of impediment to their productivity. It takes an insult from her adolescent son for the wife to see the wasteland of her existence. Wanting to do something of meaning Helene finds the beaten-up prostitute Noemie in a local hospital and devotes herself to nursing her through an arduous recovery. Thats only the start of this intricately plotted and clever film which pits a successful professional woman and a streetwalker against the underworld of French society. Helenes husband and son as well as Noemies authoritarian father and brothers and the pimps and crooks of the underworld all share a common assumption that is at the heart of their mental cruelty or outright brutality They believe -- without a shred of hesitation -- that they own the women in their lives. ""Chaos"" is a fable about women struggling to free themselves from that myth and even at its most obvious its exhilarating. This film contains scenes of physical brutality against women. -- Mick LaSalle COWBOY BEBOP THE MOVIE Animated action thriller. Starring the voices of Steven Jay Blum Daran Norris and Wendee Lee. Directed by Shinichiro Watanabe. (R. 107 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . ""Cowboy Bebop The Movie"" is based on the Japanese anime TV series that has won a loyal following in the United States. Made in Japan and dubbed into English the movie will be of interest to fans of the series but its hard to imagine this overlong overplotted and underdrawn animation winning many new converts either to the series or to anime in general. Were it replicated shot for shot as a live-action film ""Cowboy Bebop"" would be just another unpleasant science-fiction thriller with the usual mix of salaciousness and violent death. The Magritte sky and the laser-like colors will push this into the winning column for some while others will be put off by a Speed Racer-like lack of detail in the characters faces and find the animation novelty wearing thin after 10 minutes. The movie takes place in 2071 on Mars. Spike (Steven Jay Blum) is on the planet with his team of bounty hunters in search of an intergalactic menace when an explosion rocks a major Martian city and people start dropping dead from a mystery illness. Some kind of bioterrorist is at work but whats the nature of the terrorism? Viral? Bacteriological? Or something even more sinister? Though some of the film is made up of eye-catching action all too often it degenerates into long two-person conversations in which theres nothing to look at but the barely moving mouth of a blank-faced cartoon. Still there are some clever touches that keep interest alive In one scene the characters go to a drive-in theater and see a Western and the lines and scratches let us know that theyre seeing an old print of a very old (20th century) movie. - This film contains strong language violence and sexual situations. -- Mick LaSalle WHAT A GIRL WANTS Teen comedy. Starring Amanda Bynes and Colin Firth. Directed by Dennie Gordon. Written by Jenny Bicks and Elizabeth Chandler. (PG. 104 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . In ""What a Girl Wants"" a dreadful teen comedy with a ""Cinderella"" theme chipmunky Amanda Bynes plays Daphne a Manhattan teen who lives in a Chinatown walkup with her single ex-hippie mom (Kelly Preston). Life is good but when Daphne discovers that her father is a wealthy British aristocrat -- Moms been keeping it a secret -- she flies to London to meet Lord Henry Dashwood (Colin Firth) a starchy high-profile pol who doesnt know she exists. The British press corps is aroused but Henrys social-climbing fiancee (Anna Chancellor in the wicked-stepmother role) conspires to ruin the inconvenient Daphne. Directed by Dennie Gordon (""The Adventures of Joe Dirt"") ""What a Girl Wants"" is coy contrived and shamelessly derivative of ""The Princess Diaries."" In both cases a teen heroine lives with her flaky artist mom is catapulted into wealth and privilege and ultimately triumphs through honesty spunk and cheekbones. Bynes (""Big Fat Liar"") has a flat nasal voice that sounds as if shes from anywhere but New York. Exuding bland unrelenting perkiness she looks particularly bargain-basement next to her high-pedigree British co-stars. Firth recycles his rigid upper-class routine from ""Pride and Prejudice"" and ""Bridget Joness Diary."" Eileen Atkins (""Gosford Park"") plays Firths wry truth-telling mother; Jonathan Pryce is the scheming Dashwood family retainer; and Christina Cole is the fiancees wicked daughter. The script co-written by Jenny Bicks of ""Sex and the City"" is stuffed with vulgar-Yank and stuffy-Brit cliches (""No hugs dear; we only show affection to dogs and horses"") and wants us to believe that dad and Daphne bond over mutual loves of Coco Puffs motorcycles and James Brown funk. Partial relief is provided by attractive newcomer Oliver James who plays Ian Daphnes mixed-race boyfriend. A rock of wisdom Ian sees Daphne playing aristocratic games and saves her ""Why are you trying so hard to fit in"" he asks ""when youre born to stand out?"" -- Edward Guthmann Most Popular 1 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 2 Cops Son of billionaire former supermodel arrested after... 3 Ann Coulter Hammered by Conservatives for Smearing US War... 4 Dear Abby I dont want anyone to know that Ive retired 5 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 6 33 signs youre living in the San Francisco bubble 7 Inmate charged in 2015 quadruple slaying in S.F. 8 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed 9 Police Girl 14 slits teens throat in hope of first kill 10 San Francisco ranks surprisingly low on the list of 20 Most...

B- What a Girl Wants Genre Comedy Romance; Starring Amanda Bynes Colin Firth Kelly Preston Eileen Atkins Anna Chancellor Oliver James Jonathan Pryce; Director Dennie Gordon; Author Jenny Bicks; Release Date Wide 04/04/2003; Runtime (in minutes) 1; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted April 18 2003 -- 1200 AM EDT Amanda Bynes has chipmunk cheeks eyes as clear as a Kansas sky and the ability to rock out in the punkette-gymnast manner of Avril Lavigne. In What a Girl Wants she hops over to England to reunite with her long-lost dashing aristocrat father (Colin Firth). Ensconced in Daddys mansion Bynes shocks the stuffing out of all those fuddy-duddy English people even as she gets the privilege of absorbing their classy airs. The movie is a likable tween throwaway though you do wish it didnt leave you with the unfortunate sight of Colin Firth donning leather pants to play air guitar to ""Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo.""

This squirm-inducing catalog of Yank/Brit differences which spins on the way a vivacious 17-year-old New York City girl loosens up her newly met broom-up-his-bum upper-class British dad no doubt will score with the sizable target aud of female teens drawn by Amanda Bynes star of Nickelodeons ""All That"" and ""The Amanda Show"" as well as ""Big Fat Liar."" ""What a Girl Wants"" may be a modern-dress version of the frothy 1958 romantic comedy ""The Reluctant Debutante"" but it feels much more like a shameless reshuffle of ""The Princess Diaries."" This squirm-inducing catalog of Yank/Brit differences which spins on the way a vivacious 17-year-old New York City girl loosens up her newly met broom-up-his-bum upper-class British dad no doubt will score with the sizable target aud of female teens drawn by Amanda Bynes star of Nickelodeons ""All That"" and ""The Amanda Show"" as well as ""Big Fat Liar."" All others will have their teeth set on edge. Pics title serves as fair warning that every element of the script by Jenny Bicks (a ""Sex in the City"" regular) and Elizabeth Chandler (""Someone Like You"") is set up to inspire and quickly satisfy the desires of adolescent girls. Its a fairy tale to be sure but one in which everything comes so easily -- and all plot strand resolutions are so thoroughly visible from the beginning -- that theres no chance to build up any genuine longing for dreams to come true. Its fantasy time for the instant-gratification generation. The brunette somewhat puffy-faced Bynes plays Daphne Reynolds whos grown up in Gothams Chinatown with still-bohemian mom Libby (Kelly Preston). Latter has long regaled Daphne with tales of her dashingly romantic dad Henry Dashwood (Colin Firth) whom Libby met while traipsing around Morocco but with whom things just couldnt work out long-term. Without telling her mother where shes going Daphne impulsively sets off for London which gets the travelogue treatment to the accompaniment of the Clashs ""London Calling"" and where Daphne immediately meets cute young musician Ian (Oliver James). Meanwhile Dashwood has removed all the dash from his personality to become Lord Henry perpetuator of his ancient familys name a current candidate for Parliament and in the view of his longtime adviser (Jonathan Pryce) a sure-thing prime minister. When Daphne climbs the wall of the Dashwood estate and presents herself to Henry as the daughter he never knew he had he can barely speak. Things dont get much better for Firth as the picture progresses which means his character here is even more clenched and constipated than the solicitor he played in ""Bridget Joness Diary."" Expressing their discombobulation at the news of Henrys fatherhood in more demonstrative ways are his conniving fiancee Glynnis (Amanda Chancellor) for whom every move is a political decision and her snobbish daughter Clarissa (Christina Cole) who comes off like the sourest possible version of Reese Witherspoons character in ""Election."" As if born to be evil stepmother and stepsister the women do all they can to rid themselves of this potential scandal producer and rival for Henrys affections but Daphnes winning New World ways keep jolting to life a society otherwise shown as teetering on the white cliffs of calcification. Pics midsection is taken up with a succession of high-society events at which Daphne makes a spectacle of herself by puncturing all vestiges of propriety. She doesnt really mean to but she just cant help herself when she dresses way down at the Royal Dress Show (with Prince Charles in attendance) sets off a musical outburst that makes a priceless chandelier crash at a formal ball pushes Clarissas would-be b.f. into the water at a regatta endangers Henrys political prospects by inducing him to expose his old motorcycle-riding leather-pants-wearing rock n roll self and walks out of her own ""coming-out"" party just as the Queen herself is arriving. From anything but a teen wish-fulfillment p.o.v. story doesnt convince for a moment because the differences between Daphne and the society shes visiting are so artificial. Despite the wayward hijinx the scripters desperately concoct for her Daphne is an unusually composed and presentable 17-year-old hardly the stuff of anyones worst nightmares. At the same time the English upper crust here behaves as if the last 50 years hadnt happened so flustered is everyone by even the slightest breach of decorum. Given the programmatic writing and cut-and-paste direction of Dennie Gordon over whose debut film the unforgettable ""Joe Dirt"" this must in all candor be judged a slight improvement one can only be grateful for the small favor of Bynes. Not exactly a beauty nor a conveyor of character depth she nonetheless displays an ease before the camera that is disarming and suggests a maturity beyond her years. She alone makes pic watchable to the extent that it is. Chancellor (""Duckface"" in ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"") makes an easily hissable villainess while Eileen Atkins sallies forth bravely as Henrys mother and Daphnes secret ally in the household. Sylvia Syms turns up briefly as a grande dame with an eccentric little dog. Extensive use is made of London and surrounding locations while soundtrack collection of more than two dozen pop tunes is as predictable as the story.
