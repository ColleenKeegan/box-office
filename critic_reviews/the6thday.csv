The films subject is appropriate because almost everything in the movie seems to be lifted from the DNA of other pictures. Despite some deft touches this logy thriller seems so familiar that you may find yourself waiting for its star Arnold Schwarzenegger to awake and find that hes actually in ""Total Recall"" which was also about confusion. ""The Sixth Day"" is set in the near future a phrase that could be applied to almost every movie that stars Mr. Schwarzenegger. His Adam Gibson is anachronistic; he prefers antiques like his vintage Cadillac to contemporary cars that drive themselves. (Its also a way for the filmmakers to squeeze in a product placement for OnStar the automobile navigation system though the OnStar people may not be so happy when they see the movie.) Adam has embraced some parts of the near future like the cool electronic pilot device that lets him fly the helicopters of his excursion service without being on board. Adam is disturbed by his partner Hanks obsessive use of a virtual girlfriend; she is programmed to comfort Hank (Michael Rapaport) every time he enters his apartment. In this near future cloning has become both a boon and a curse. Adam doesnt like it. He doesnt want to get his daughter a clone of the family dog; ""Its creepy"" he snarls. In a few instances in which the predatory business aspects of science brush up against real life ""The Sixth Day"" seems inspired; the pet service is called RePet. (""I might be back"" Adam remarks to the RePet salesman which is one of the few times that the movie is amusing about its duplicative theme.) To make up for not getting a doggie clone Adam buys a semi-clone doll a SimPal for his child. The almost lifelike -- and nearly life-size -- SimPal is an amusingly irritating mass of mannerisms with loose skin that brings to mind Kevin Spaceys scar-tissue-by-the-yard makeup job in ""Pay It Forward."" When Adam gets home with the SimPal he finds himself replaced by a clone celebrating his birthday and enjoying the warmth of his family. Others feel even more strongly about cloning than Adam does calling it an abomination. Although the Sixth Day law taking its name from Genesis has been passed making cloning of human beings illegal that hasnt stopped an evil corporation from surreptitiously manufacturing clones. Clones have no rights nor can they own anything; in that respect theyre like the replicants in ""Blade Runner"" a film that tried to deal with the rising consciousness of near-humans. The clones are sometimes used as jokes henchmen who are killed over and over again a nod to the endless parade -- and annihilation -- of the assassins gunning for Mr. Schwarzenegger in his previous movies. (In keeping with the tongue-in-cheek self-awareness Adam says before a fight breaks out near his daughter ""I dont want to expose her to any graphic violence. She already gets enough of that from the media."") A biotech mogul Michael Drucker (Tony Goldwyn) makes passionate speeches about using the technology to aid humanity. And behind closed doors he tosses off lines like ""Im just taking over where God left off."" The secret use of cloning is first shown when Johnny Phoenix a pro football player who apparently took his name from the X-Men is fatally injured during a game. Though dragged off the field like a broken doll Phoenix later miraculously reappears unharmed. (Whats more surprising is that his team the Roadrunners isnt getting mauled on a weekly basis considering that the team logo looks like Big Bird.) When the real Adam finally leaps into action to protect his way of life -- though he seems merely annoyed by the idea of having been cloned -- ""The Sixth Day"" jerks to life. The director Roger Spottiswoode handles the action proficiently. He has an eye for organization and detail; Adams dive from a bridge is shot so gloriously that youre disappointed that Eastern European judges arent standing by to score the achievement. Such a use of Mr. Spottiswoodes skills are preferable in movies like his superb ""Under Fire"" which actually has a political context. The rueful touches are where Mr. Spottiswoode scores. One bad guy (Michael Rooker) reminds a whiny henchman ""Weve all been killed before."" A scientist Griffin Weir (Robert Duvall) has scenes with his dying wife a clone with a defective gene implanted by Drucker that play with dreamy hurt. Adam radiates delight when he takes a hit from the carefully saved stub of a Cuban cigar since smoking has been banned in the future. (Watching Mr. Schwarzenegger a cigar aficionado puff on an old stogie is this films version of showing him do his own stunts. Its even more impressive than watching the stars picture-perfect butterfly stroke in the vat of fluids in which the clones are stored -- a swim previously seen in ""True Lies"" -- as he steals oxygen from their supply.) Some of the concepts seen here like the constant onslaught of television commercials seemed premonitory in ""Robocop"" which was also made with a ""Sixth Day"" co-producer Jon Davison. This movie plays like something picked up at a vintage store; you can see all the greasy fingerprints from those who have handled it before. The ways ""The Sixth Day"" shows the limits of imminent biotechnology are almost touching. Science can clone Adam but it cant create a double whose accent is easier to understand. Its touching too that Mr. Schwarzenegger has muted the swagger and seems a little slower with many finely etched lines around his bulldozer chin. Even the near future cant stop the march of time from crumbling the granite jaw of films foremost action figure. ""The Sixth Day"" may leave you pondering a question its makers never posed Whats to become of Arnold Schwarzenegger in the near future? ""The Sixth Day"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes scenes of implied sex with a virtual woman incessant violence inflicted on clones and language that would burn the ears of any sentient life form. THE SIXTH DAY Directed by Roger Spottiswoode; written by Cormac Wibberley and Marianne Wibberley; director of photography Pierre Mignot; edited by Mark Conte Dominique Fortin and Michel Arcand; music by Trevor Rabin; production designers James Bissell and John Willett; produced by Mike Medavoy Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jon Davison; released by Columbia Pictures. Running time 124 minutes. This film is rated PG-13.

Commercial results look to fall somewhere in between those for ""End of Days"" which generated a disappointing 67 million domestically and thesps 1996 ""Eraser"" which clocked 101 million in North America. Stars overseas totals generally run at minimum 40% more than the local take. Clones of all kinds have popped up in countless sci-fi films in recent years but rarely have they played as central or credible a role as they do in this otherwise formulaic story set in a near-future in which human cloning is illegal but is practiced surreptitiously by a heinous biotech corporation. Its a thoroughly recognizable world in which animal cloning for example is commonly accepted so that kids never have to be deprived of their cuddly furry loved ones and so that the world can be well nourished by a renewed food supply. In this context adventure helicopter pilot Adam Gibson (Schwarzenegger) is in some respects a traditionalist throwback; he drives a 50s Cadillac doesnt want to coddle his daughter with an identical replacement when the family dog croaks and believes in ""the natural process of life -youre born you live and you die."" But in his professional realm Adam embraces high-tech; in a nifty early sequence he remote-pilots a second unoccupied helicopter while zooming through some mountain canyons in the chopper of his Double X Charter partner Hank (Michael Rapaport). The pair consent to a fancy fingerprinting and eyesight-testing process requested by a special customer genetic engineering tycoon Michael Drucker (Tony Goldwyn). Adam should have known better for when he soon thereafter returns home to attend his birthday party he finds an exact duplicate of himself already celebrating with his family and friends. Unenlightened as to how or why he was cloned mild-mannered homebody Adam is instantly forced into action-hero mode. Pursued by Druckers goons on a wild chase into the night Adam outdrives them in his old Caddy eluding their electric zap guns in a world seemingly voided of bullets but finally ends up pirouetting off a cliff into the drink now understanding the full extent of his jeopardy. Husband and wife first-time scenarists Cormac and Marianne Wibberley concoct numerous other requisite action scenes which enable Schwarzenegger to do what comes naturally even if he now does it rather less roughly and with some hesitation. In a surprisingly direct (and intentionally humorous) commentary on the recent brouhaha over screen violence and the stars own desire to tone it down Adam is going after some villains when he remarks re his daughter ""I dont want to expose her to any graphic violence. She already gets enough of that from the media."" All the same theres plenty of it here even though its more generalized and far less bloody than equivalent combat would have produced in the past. Adam repeatedly offs two Drucker enforcers (Sarah Wynter and Rod Rowland) clones who keep being reproduced and coming back for more; zaps off the lower leg of the chief henchman (Michael Rooker) only to see him return intact; almost solves his problem by shooting his own clone (who provokes Adams jealousy by making whoopee with his wife) but cant quite come to terms with killing ""himself"" and has a climactic confrontation with Drucker that forces the ice-blooded tycoon into an emergency attempt to clone himself a slimy procedure that again would likely have been played much more gruesomely a year or two ago. As routinely staged by director Roger Spottiswoode and shot in a kind of gloomy eternal night by lenser Pierre Mignot that all too closely resembles the nocturnal funk of ""End of Days"" the action scenes prove functional if uninspired and are generally trumped in interest by the way the film works pointed provocative and legitimate views of cloning issues into a genre format. When faced with anti-cloning protests the fearsomely bright Drucker makes cogent points about replenishing the worlds fish supply and replacing terminally ill people with healthy clones. Latter point hits home in a subplot involving Druckers genius lead scientist (Robert Duvall) whose wife is dying and doesnt want to be cloned into perpetuity. On the other hand Drucker moves insidiously behind the scenes to manipulate politicians into changing the ""6th Day law"" that bans cloning all the while breaking the law himself within the confines of his vast HQ/lab building in which full-sized future ""humans"" hang suspended in tanks waiting to be activated by personality imprints. While the ease and speed with which the company goons for instance are reproduced strains credulity the basic moral issues the opposition and possible connivance of corporate and political interests and the potential for a rogue figure to flaunt rules and standards are all presented in ways that provoke some thought even as the drama plays itself out in conventional fashion. In its lighter moments film has a little fun with the virtual future giving Hank a voluptuous virtual girlfriend so completely compliant that he has no desire for a real woman and presenting a police station in which suspects are offered virtual court-appointed attorneys and psychiatrists. Well-known cigar aficionado Schwarzenegger clearly relishes a scene in which his character in defiance of a nationwide smoking ban sneaks a stogie in his garage. Schwarzenegger playing a family man who gets to spend almost no time with his family looks leaner than ever and tosses off his trademark quips (""I might be back"" he tells a cloned pet salesman) with a self-consciousness that betrays an acknowledgment of how long hes been doing this routine. Goldwyn is chillingly detestable as the ruthless businessman who boasts that ""Im just taking over where God left off"" and assorted henchmen are well delineated physically. Effects work is very good overall although the repeated herky-jerky scene transitions quickly emerge as a tiresome affectation.

The 6th Day a high-body-count action gloss on Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Blade Runner (the faux humans who tromp through the movie are like pods crossed with replicants) is one of those irresistible science-fiction potboilers like Demolition Man or Total Recall thats jammed with corny but fun satirical details of a not-so-brave new world -- taco-flavored bananas a shopping mall with a virtual-aquarium ceiling a hologram ""girlfriend"" wholl greet you with a smile and a lap dance. At the center of the movie is a solid gimmick that may or may not be an intentional howler Schwarzenegger as a personality is such a hammy and overdeliberate robo-lug that when hes on screen along with his double theres no way to tell the difference. The pod version is every bit as ""real"" as the real thing. The 6th Day is a bit of a clone itself but its got a crackerjack helicopter chase a semblance of a script and a sotto voce performance by Robert Duvall as a biotech genius who murmurs sweet nothings to his dying cloned wife. For Arnolds career at least its not quite the end of days. B- Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

Which Arnie is real and which one is Memorex? Its fair to wonder just how long it will take before the two Arnies meet. At 53 Schwarzenegger may be the dangling chad of action heroes. Hes a little worn but he still counts. His face may now appear almost as sculpted as his body used to but when he gets that slightly mad light in his eyes watch out. This movie knows how to entertain. It touches a lot of bases including sly satire (it was directed by Roger Spottiswoode who did Brosnan-as-Bonds ""Tomorrow Never Dies""). There is a running thread of macabre humor but the best thing about it may be plain old moviemaking instinct. As soon as ""The 6th Day"" shows signs of bogging down in its own cleverness in its twisting plot a jolt of horror kick-starts it again. Schwarzenegger plays Adam Gibson good family man and pilot for a charter airline who frankly already seems like some kind of clone Hes so sunny enthusiastic and positive-minded that he seems a little goofy. He practically pants. The film is set only 10 years in the future and it should be no surprise that technology rules even more than it does today. In football scrimmage tactics from coaches on the sidelines flash inside the quarterbacks visor on the field. At home Adams schedule for the day flashes on the mirror as he shaves. Soon he will get a shocking look at himself but it wont be in the mirror. For some this may seem like techno paradise. Bachelors have virtual live- in girlfriends who come -- and go -- at the flick of a switch. But paradise can just as quickly turn into techno hell. Doors with security locks are fingerprint-activated whether the finger is attached to a hand or not. Tony Goldwyn all in black including the hair is the arch villain technocrat Michael Drucker who runs the international genetic-engineering giant Replacement Technologies (terrific name). Goldwyn whos got a pretty terrific name himself as Hollywood pedigrees go is also a director (""A Walk on the Moon""). As Drucker he comes across as one smooth operator a dot-commer who struck it fabulously rich and is convinced that he deserves it. Druckers presence would be reassuring if it were not so slick but he may have made the cosmic mistake of imitating Gods work on the sixth day of creation -- when He created Man. There are ""6th Day laws"" that make it illegal to clone humans. There are even anti-cloning fundamentalist terrorists. It doesnt stop Drucker but his mad-scientist colleague (Robert Duvall) may be showing disturbing signs of a conscience. Its OK to clone dead house pets and Replacement Technologies does a big business in it although some people including Adam find the practice distasteful. Little girls can get ""syn pals"" too lifelike dolls with pigtails and creepy eyes. It helps to pay attention to eyes in ""The 6th Day."" They may be windows to the soul but theyre windows to human DNA maps too. Paranoids can keep that in mind the next time theyre fitted like Adam into a contraption for a ""routine"" eye exam. Anybody who ever wished he could tape-record his memory and play it back will find that someone has beat him to it here. Recordings of visual memories flash past and eventually will offer a clue to the nicely ambiguous ending. . Advisory This movies contains violence and sexual innuendo.
