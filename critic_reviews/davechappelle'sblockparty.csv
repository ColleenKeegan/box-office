Chappelles idea is to take hip hop back to its roots bypassing commerce and giving a voice to artists whose controversial lyrics are seldom heard on commerical radio. We watch Chappelle and friends as they rehearse for the event dish out free tickets to both young and old and gather an impressive line-up of artists from the more soulful conscious side of hip hop including Mos Def Talib Kweli Dead Prez Erykah Badu The Roots Common and Kanye West. Chappelle keeps things lively joking on camera punctuating the acts with gags  while Michel Gondry maintains our interest focusing as much on Chappelles energy and wit and goings-on behind the scenes as the gig itself. Gondry lets himself meander for example interviewing a pair of crazy old hippies who live near to the makeshift stage or focusing on the Ohio school band hired by Chappelle. The music wins out though not least when the Fugees perform together for the first time in ages.

Starring Dave Chappelle Kanye West Mos Def Lauryn Hill and Jill Scott. Directed by Michel Gondry. (Rated R. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) For many fans it was tough watching a squirming Dave Chappelle go on ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" earlier this year and talk seriously about race the trappings of fame and giving some of his ""Chappelles Show"" money to charity. Kind of like when your fun friend goes on the wagon and you realize with guilt that the only thing you had in common was the drinking. ""Dave Chappelles Block Party"" is a return to rowdy form for the comic in part because it was filmed before Oprah his mysterious trip to South Africa and the still-confusing events that aborted the third season of his thriving Comedy Central show. But the entertaining concert film also focuses on a fun-loving and kindhearted side of the comic which hasnt always come across in Chappelles TV program and movie roles. In a good way it turns out Chappelle has more in common with Ellen DeGeneres than anyone could have ever imagined. The setup for ""Block Party"" will be familiar for anyone who has watched ""Woodstock"" ""Wattstax"" or even ""Waynes World 2."" Chappelle in late 2004 organized a huge concert in a Brooklyn intersection inviting a diverse crowd from that area while busing in some neighbors from his Ohio home. A variety of rap and Ramp;B artists show up including Kanye West Mos Def Jill Scott and the Roots. Chappelle acts as master of ceremonies between the performances which are broken up with flashback scenes of him casually joking with neighbors meeting with the artists and recruiting audience members. (""Attention Huxtables"" Chappelle shouts through a megaphone as he drives by some upscale-looking New York buildings that resemble the front stoop in ""The Cosby Show."" ""There is a block party jump-off on Quincy (Street). ... Bring Rudy and Theo and Denise."") The movie works first and foremost because its not self-indulgent. Chappelle begins by explaining that ""this is the concert I always wanted to see"" -- later admitting that every comic wants to be a musician and every musician thinks hes a comic. Considering that the pressure of success and overzealous fans seemed to contribute to Chappelles bizarre behavior last year its cathartic to see the comic getting dizzy from some hero worship of his own. Just as filmmaking veteran Mel Stuart was recruited to make the concert film ""Wattstax"" in 1973 Chappelle found a creative-minded director in Michel Gondry who also directed ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" along with several groundbreaking videos by Bjork. Gondry takes a guerrilla filmmaking approach caring little if a boom mike bobs into a frame or if Big Daddy Kane and the Dead Prez are momentarily out of focus. But when putting together the big picture Gondry is a complete pro planting his cameras so movie audiences can feel what it was like to be in the crowd and be a performer on the stage. He has a dream venue in the gritty yet charming Brooklyn alley where the concert takes place -- one building at first appears to be a crack den and then from a slightly different camera angle looks like a cathedral. ""Block Party"" may not convert people who didnt like Chappelle or rap music to begin with but it offers a persuasive argument for both. A talented band including a horn section backs most of the artists and even Sinatra purists will have a hard time avoiding the emotional pull of a surprise reunion by the Fugees. The movie drags on about 10 minutes too long. A few segments -- including an angry yet hard-to-follow presentation about some political prisoners -- come from out of nowhere and momentarily derail the successfully simple music-Chappelle-music structure that fills most of the movie. But this block party is clearly Chappelles show and its easy to sit through a few minutes of meandering to get to his next spontaneous moment -- especially when the host seems so willing to let down his guard. When Chappelle talks with regular folks hes not Barry Bonds putting on a dress and clowning around the cameras for one day in an attempt to undo more than a decade of anti-social behavior. Hes a guy who has always liked his audience and after being disconnected from them while making his TV show wants to give something back. This appears to be the real Dave Chappelle. And its becoming clearer that whether ""Chappelles Show"" returns or not the comics best work may still be yet to come. -- Advisory This film contains profanity and drug humor. Moviegoers who dont like marijuana smoke should be warned that with the possible exception of ""Harold amp; Kumar Go to White Castle"" this could be the stoner movie of the decade. If youre pregnant on parole or just worried about getting a contact high best to see this movie with all the squares in Walnut Creek.

The event which celebrates his love of stand-up and live music allows Chappelle a bit more control over his audience which seems an issue for the comedian who left filming of Comedy Centrals Chappelles Show in the middle of its third season. Chappelle starts Block Party by trying to hand-pick his audience. He distributes golden tickets to acquaintances and new friends near Dayton Ohio. He gives concert passes which include a bus ride to New York and an overnight stay to thunderstruck teenage boys women who work at the convenience store where he buys his cigarettes and the Central State University marching band. Its a mixed group -- black/white older/youngish men/women. But there are no kids invited to this R-rated concert where four-letter words are part of the lyrics. In Brooklyn Chappelle invites neighbors around the Downing and Quincy streets intersection to attend the event which took place in September 2004. Internet buzz has all types of trusting New Yorkers lining up to catch buses bound for an unknown concert destination. It doesnt take long to get the party started in this 103-minute film directed by Michel Gondry (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind). Even in the intermittent rain the performers seem to be having a good time. Theres a spontaneous feel. Kanye West makes the scene with the marching band and John Legend. West performs with Mos Def. Then hes with Talib Kweli and Common. Erykah Badu jumps onstage with Jill Scott. Then during her set Badu rips off her wig without missing a beat when the wind kicks up. Dead Prez gets the crowd jumping. The Roots Cody Chesnutt and Big Daddy Kane take their turns Standouts include multitalented Mos Def ?uestloves thoughtful Ahmir Thompson and the Fugees whose reunion ends the show. The crowd appreciates the magic that Lauryn Hill Wyclef Jean and Pras bring to the stage. Theres a reverential quietness when Hill begins an a capella Killing Me Softly that segues into a hip-hop thrill ride. Interspersed between the songs are bits featuring Chappelle doing crazy comedy sketches musing about who killed Biggie Smalls visiting a day-care center and plunking out Round About Midnight on a thrift-store piano. His racial jokes have an edge but they are not as deadly as the Chappelles Show skits. lana.berkowitzchron.com Todays Deals SanDisk 128GB Cruzer Glide USB Flash Drive for 20 + pickup at...

With a routine that once again shows how ready for their close-ups Americans are the duo launch into the ""Chappelles Show"" theme song. They then tell a story about a ""golfing"" outing. One of them had to relieve himself. So he did trying to respect tee decorum but also aware that any number of golfers do the same. Out of a nearby house comes the owner who hurls the N-word at him. The only thing that kept the young man from fighting is that he and his friend had tickets for Chappelles rap-music extravaganza. The popular-culture rub of course is that theyll hear that word (and other raw language that got the film an R rating) tossed from the outdoor stage set up on a street in New Yorks Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood time and again. But then this is one of the racial conundrums Chappelle is so good at teasing. Directed by ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" director Michel Gondry and shot by Ellen Kuras ""Block Party"" is as deceptively rough-hewn a venture as Chappelles old variety show for Comedy Central. It feels rangy but is also a work of expert timing. The D.C-born comic threw this inaugural block party in September 2004. Last week he was in Denver for Comedy Works gigs and a sold-out block-party throwdown at the Paramount Theatre. ""Its the concert Ive always wanted to see"" Chappelle says. Hes ringmaster and court jester of the day-into-night affair featuring Kanye West Common Dead Prez Erykah Badu Jill Scott Mos Def and the reunion of the Fugees and the amazing Lauryn Hill. As star-powered as the concert is its hard not to crave more Dave. In one of many toss-offs he drives through blocks of Brooklyn brownstones. ""Attention Huxtables"" he says on a megaphone. ""Bring Rudy. Bring Theo."" It makes sense that Gondry helms ""Block Party."" The French director has created a number of ingenious music videos and grasps the creative tension between the comedian and musician. The movie cuts in preparation for the concert with actual performances and Chappelles trip to Yellow Springs Ohio where he lives. In Ohio three days before the concert he invites fellow residents to his shindig in the hood. He also makes a trip to Central State University. What better place to find a drum-line marching band? These meetings with remarkably regular folk are the films most engaging scenes. When Chappelle goes into the store where he buys his coffee the woman at the register tells him in a way that sounds almost unkind that she just hopes hell come in do his business and leave. Then she admits that inside shes screaming ""Its Dave Chappelle"" Famously - or infamously to borrow the word the comic used during his recent ""Inside the Actors Studio"" appearance - Chappelle walked away from his Comedy Central show and a 50 million contract. He went to South Africa. Although the concert took place months before Chappelle left his show coupled with that Actors Studio appearance ""Block Party"" gives us a portrait of a man intent to entertain but also driven to stay connected. That can cost you.  | ""Dave Chappelles Block Party"" R for language|CONCERT DOCUMENTARY|Directed by Michel Gondry; photography by Ellen Kuras; featuring Dave Chappelle Kanye West Mos Def Talib Kweli Common Erykah Badu Jill Scott the Roots the Fugees with Lauryn Hill and some of the good people of Ohio|Opens today at area theaters.

"Chappelle throws a jubilant Block Party - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Chappelle throws a jubilant Block Party By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  March 3 2006 Two years ago on a gray September day the comedian Dave Chappelle held a noon-to-night concert in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. Scores of New Yorkers were bused in from Manhattan and had no idea where they were going -- they didnt care. Kanye West Mos Def Erykah Badu the Roots Common Big Daddy Kane and Talib Kweli were among those who performed in the wind and rain. The next day the blogs and later the magazines were in a tizzy over the Fugees who had recovered from Lauryn Hills nervous breakdown and Pras and Wyclef Jeans spatting to consummate a reunion.Being there must have been special. But watching this all happen in Dave Chappelles Block Party"" is better. For one thing you wont get wet. For another Michel Gondry the music-video magician and director of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" was on the scene with a camera crew. The movie theyve assembled is in the vein of 1973s Wattstax"" but its much more than a concert documentary. Its a jubilant civic-minded lollapalooza.Yes each performance is more transcendent than the last. Badu literally flips her Afro wig then surfs the crowd. Dead Prez confirms that its as crucial as Public Enemy but in double time. Hill is as willowy-fabulous as 1970s Diana Ross. (When Pras says hearing her sing makes him want to cry all I could think after seeing her do a luscious Killing Me Softly"" was Me too"") And had there been a house that day Jill Scott would have brought it down.But the more indelible contributions to the film are from the so-called little people.The movie is indeed a block party that great seemingly bygone Saturday event when a street shuts down to celebrate itself. And because it is a block party the artists in Chappelles platinum hip-hop-Ramp;B lineup are but a few stars in a neighborhood constellation that includes less famous folk. The community here is synthetic insofar as some of its members come from the workaday Dayton Ohio region where Chappelle still lives; he goes back to cajole his neighbors to come east for his weekend shindig. But its a community nonetheless. We can feel the love.On the streets of Dayton Chappelle hands out Willy Wonka-style golden tickets good for a round-trip bus ride to the show and a hotel stay choosing black people and white people alike. This includes the woman who runs a local corner store and an affable pair of teenage Chappelle fans who tell Gondry they decided not to beat up a racist because the ensuing trouble wouldnt have been worth missing the party. Watching the Daytonites most of whom didnt know each other before this invitation asleep on the New York-bound bus is a wonderful moment of peace and harmony. In Ohio Chappelle who pulled all this off before last years notorious breakdown also stumbles upon the Central State University marching band. His discovery leads to the happy moment when the kids find out theyre going to New York. They explode with surprise. And during their street procession backing Kanye West on Jesus Walks"" the drum line and the majorettes seem more glamorous than the best-selling rapper playing their marshal. They know theyre as good at their job as West is at his.And thats the power of this movie. This is a black America that the music videos and movies dont show but eagerly sell to. The kids in that band and the two dudes who take a break from fighting racism are people with ideas aspirations and personalities. They get to go backstage and they seem star-struck but they also seem relieved to have their suspicions confirmed that the world is bigger than Ohio.After we see the Fugees perform Wyclef talks to a handful of the CSU students about what theyd do if they ran the country. One girl says shed create more scholarships. Then they try joining him on the chorus of his song President"" which hadnt hit the radio yet. The moment feels like one of the classroom sessions from Lauryn Hills solo record. Its piercing. I cant remember the last time someone in a movie bothered to ask a black girl what she thought about much of anything.Block Party"" would play as an exquisite chaser to the tragic realism in Spike Lees community masterpiece Do the Right Thing"" which is also set in Bed-Stuy and in its own way is a social musical. Block Party"" is the more rambling movie. Besides the priceless backstage moments are those when Gondry follows Chappelle as he makes his way around Bed-Stuy talking for instance to the ancient owners of the amazing ruin that overlooks the block where the party is scheduled to be. (Chappelle calls the place a crack house. But its the most Dickensian of crack houses.) He even visits the day-care center that the Notorious B.I.G. attended and that doubles as the concerts greenroom.All these sequences are scattered among the concert performances. This structure has a great democratizing effect. For one day there doesnt appear to be any useful difference between the haves and the have-nots -- between Jill Scott; the girl who as president would order up more scholarships; and the serious principal who walks Chappelle around her school. When Chappelle exclaims We shook up the world We shook up the world"" it doesnt feel like an overstatement at all.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Dave Chappelle threw a block party in Brooklyn in September 2004 and cameras were there to record it. Rogue Pictures Besides being filled with Chappelles hilarious sense of humor the movie features life-affirming messages and great music by serious rap artists with political socio-cultural and spiritual themes. These artists who include Kanye West Erykah Badu Mos Def The Fugees Jill Scott Common and The Roots are all about freedom not bling. A line from a song by the Dead Prez sums it up succinctly ""You rather have a Lexus or justice/A necklace or freedom?"" The documentary is a hybrid of comedy music political commentary and cultural empowerment. It also offers an engaging and entertaining behind-the-scenes look at organizing a massive street event in Brooklyns Bedford-Stuyvesant area. Chappelle drives around the streets of New York with a megaphone ""Attention Huxtables"" he yells in an upscale neighborhood. ""Were throwing a block party."" About the movieDave Chappelles Block Party    (out of four) Stars Dave Chappelle Kanye West Mos Def Erykah Badu Director Michel Gondry Distributor Rogue Pictures Rating R for language Running time 1 hour 38 minutes Opens Friday nationwide Initially Chappelle gives out free ""golden"" tickets and chartered bus rides to people from Dayton Ohio his hometown. ""Even Willy Wonka didnt give out this many"" he says. Among those attending are an impressive and dedicated marching band from Ohios Central State University a pair of middle-aged probation officers and a 60ish store owner not too familiar with rap music but ready for a party. Chappelle pronounces the concert the thing he is most proud of in his career and its clear that director Michel Gondry (who also made Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) has respect and admiration for his subjects. The film is not overtly political but the message is clear Much needs to be done for neglected urban areas. The focus however is upbeat not preachy. The film occasionally drags but tries to mix it up with a ""making of"" video style. Musical interludes segue into Chappelles casual interviews and quips. Surveying the crowd he says ""Five thousand black people chillin and 19 white people peppered in the crowd. Im trying to find a Mexican."" Later he learns some gestures and expressions from a pair of Latinos on the street. ""This is the concert Ive always wanted to see"" Chappelle says. Now we all can.

"Block Party Dave Chappelles Good Old Days washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Block Party Dave Chappelles Good Old Days Months before he bolted from Comedy Central the comic gives a free concert in Brooklyn. (D. Lee) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday March 3 2006 The Dave Chappelle we see in ""Dave Chappelles Block Party"" is a relaxed man in a state of hilarious playfulness. And why not? The film was shot in 2004 when hed just signed a 50 million deal for two more seasons of his comedy series ""Chappelles Show"" which was reaping record-breaking DVD sales. Watching him on-screen theres not even a hint of the events that would unfold eight months later Chappelle bolted from the TV shows production jetting to Africa and sparking wild speculation about his mental state drugs and behind-the-scenes power struggles at Comedy Central. Instead we get a home-movieish documentary that follows Chappelle from his rural retreat in Yellow Springs Ohio to a free concert for more than 5000 he hosted in Brooklyn N.Y. And unlike his show sketches -- which feel tightly rehearsed featuring Chappelle in roles from crackhead to stuffy ""white"" newscaster -- ""Block Party"" shows him as an easygoing man comfortable with his widespread popularity. The jagged Chappelle wit is never far away however as he hands out ""golden tickets"" (for bus and lodging) to white and black fans in Ohio and New York inviting them to the concert. ""Old people [bleep]-ing love me man"" Chappelle quips to the camera after he has charmed his way through a swath of senior-age fans in Yellow Springs. Chappelle has said the free concert in the up-and-coming Fort Greene neighborhood was meant to evoke the community spirit of Wattstax the day-long concert held at the Los Angeles Coliseum in 1972; the film of that concert features the comedy of a young Richard Pryor. There is a clear festive buzz as attendees laugh bob and listen to Chappelles impish inventive comedy and to some of the best music hip-hop has to offer from Kanye West a reunited Fugees Mos Def Jill Scott and several others. The nine-hour event also included the rah-rah music of Ohios Central State University marching band which Chappelle bused to the event apparently on a whim. Filmmaker Michel Gondry who directed ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" and a handful of Bjork videos hasnt done more than trail his subject from Yellow Springs to Brooklyn. There are no penetrating interviews about Chappelle who was raised mostly in Washington and no scenes or moments to savor for their documentary impact. Here the name of the game is following along. After all Chappelle is the show. He may be one funny-looking scrawny dude -- he could be the love child of Elmer Fudd and Grace Jones -- but hes eminently entertaining whether hes glad-handing shopkeepers in rural Ohio or vamping it up onstage ""Five thousand black people chillin in the rain"" he says playing a set of congas as he surveys his audience under dark drizzly skies. ""Nineteen white people peppered into the crowd."" He strains his eyes pretending to search for something. ""Trying to find a Mexican. Buenos dias  I know youre out there"" If theres one thing to be learned from the life of Dave Chappelle (or at least from ""Dave Chappelle"") its that being famous can be a whole lot of fun. In satirical James Brown mode Chappelle orders his backup band to strike a single chord in unison whenever he points at them. He makes them do it once. Wham Then again. Wham He makes them do it twice Wham-wham He tests them by pretending to address the crowd and then suddenly whipping out his arm. Wham Theres an innocent joy here and a genial detachment as if Chappelles playing host to his own celebrity. Hes Johnny Carsoning his fame as it were. But theres something deeper at work too. Even with his cutting racial satire -- and yes some of the profanity-laced comedy you saw on his Comedy Central show -- he seems uniquely positioned to appeal to white and black Americans. In Yellow Springs for instance Chappelle goes door-to-door charming the kind of locals you might call hip-hop-challenged. Theyre obviously fond of their famous neighbor. ""I wouldnt know what to wear to a block party"" says one white woman a shopkeeper whos clearly tickled at Chappelles invitation. And when Chappelle persuades that marching band all African American to accompany him to Brooklyn the thrill in their faces is its own kind of music. The show itself is a revelatory spectacle a microcosmic gathering of contemporary black America in a Brooklyn back street. Theyre not just watching Chappelle but celebrating themselves. And Chappelle isnt playing the caustic outsider a traditional role for all too many black comedians. Hes part of the status quo and inviting everyone in. Dave Chappelles Block Party (103 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for profanity and drug references.

But it isnt often you get to hear a marching band as supercharged and low-down as rudely alive as the one in Dave Chappelles Block Party. On a makeshift stage at the end of a wide crumbling alleyway in Brooklyns Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood Kanye West looking casually dapper in a black T-shirt sport coat and gold chains his body coiling and tensing to the beat raps in what can only be described as a holy fury. At first before you adjust to the velocity of his words you may think that hes engaged in some sort of wily verbal assault. But then just behind him you catch the crooning of John Legend as well as a chanted chorus (""Je-sus walks Jesus walks"") underscored by the stately ominous hot-funk bounce of Ohios Central State University band whose players are arranged on the avenue nearby. Wests rap is nothing less than a shout-out to God and as you take in his confession plus Legends soaring plaint plus the majestic blaring and swaying of the CSU band the music surges to an ecstatic peak. All of a sudden you remember what its like when a concert movie isnt just glorified music-television fodder but rather an event that can restore your faith. It helps that we got to see Chappelle a few scenes earlier sauntering up to the CSU band in the middle of a practice field in Dayton Ohio and asking the members on the spot to take a bus to New York and join the big rap/Ramp; B concert hes organizing which is set to take place on Sept. 18 2004. With his shaved head half-lidded eyes and infectious grin thats always in danger of shutting off as quickly as it lights up Chappelle has the look of a terminally mischievous cartoon bunny rabbit. In Dave Chappelles Block Party he exists in a perpetual limbo of satirical detachment but only because he appears to be deviously fascinated by every person and situation he encounters. Like Richard Pryor hes all feelers with a mockery that flows almost compulsively out of his screwy generosity of spirit. Everything Chappelle does in this movie -- from strolling with bullhorn in hand through his hometown of Dayton offering ""golden tickets"" to random citizens to standing up on stage and telling the band over and over to ""hit me"" as he lives out the fantasy of being James Brown with each jangly-hilarious ""hit"" -- is done on impulse as an inspired whim. Yet its all presented with such catchy soft-shoe enthusiasm that the film effectively dissolves the line between audience and performer. Dave Chappelles Block Party is perhaps the first concert movie since Stop Making Sense to give you a blissful buzz. The buzz comes from the music which has a loose burning joy thats rare to behold in a live rap performance and also from Chappelles wicked pranksters glee which spreads through the movie like a happy virus. Block Party features Chappelle as its impresario on-scene jester and guiding spirit and the director Michel Gondry echoing techniques he used in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind keeps cutting between the run-up to the concert and the event itself staging the film as a series of flickering time leaps that work on you almost kinesthetically. After a while you stop thinking about ""past"" and ""present."" Youre eager simply to be in the now as content to watch a rapping Brooklyn waiter who turns out to be a brilliant boaster as you are to see an incendiary stage performance by Dead Prez with their blistering indictments of white power. The enthralling spirit of Dave Chappelles Block Party its mood of exuberant democracy extends to every rap and soul performance in the film. A lot of the artists like Kanye West or Common summon an intensity of rhythm and attitude that didnt exist in hip-hop before the form went gangsta in the early 90s yet all of them in different ways reject the get rich and f-- the world nihilism that ultimately brought gangsta rap to such a dead end. You can feel the longing for a more redemptive era when Erykah Badu tearing off her Afro wig in the wind does a gorgeous paean to ""back in the day when things were cool"" and that spirit extends to Mos Def (who has the greatest dimples in rap) singing about his desire ""to be free"" or the Roots with Kool G Rap and Big Daddy Kane playing the ferocious ""Boom."" Its part of the rousing offhandedness of Block Party that the finale in which Lauryn Hill with her china-doll face and luscious tremolo reunites with the Fugees to do ""Killing Me Softly With His Song"" is sublime but no more so than a follow-up scene in which Wyclef Jean off stage leads a group of those CSU marching band members in his great reggae anthem ""President"" (""If I was president..."") letting them -- and the audience -- know that in music as in the world anything is still possible.

Even as he continues on the comeback trail from his self-imposed exile comic Dave Chappelle remains teasingly elusive. Fans of his inspired stand-up and shockingly funny Comedy Central series may feel there isnt enough of the star -- or of his freestyle comic fireworks -- in ""Dave Chappelles Block Party."" But the formidable line-up of hip-hop and Ramp;B artists should attract hordes of appreciative ticketbuyers to this enjoyable performance doc helmed by Michel Gondry (""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind""). And if Chappelle tends to be more of a genial host than star here never mind His full-tilt exuberance is richly amusing and highly contagious. A heady spirit of spontaneity permeates the proceedings suggesting the entire pic much like the concert it documents was conceived planned and completed in a single burst of creative enthusiasm. Early set-up scenes follow Chappelle around his Ohio hometown as he impulsively invites casual acquaintances total strangers and even an entire college marching band to a free outdoor concert a few days hence in a Brooklyn neighborhood. (He offers free bus transportation to and from the venue.) Cynics might suspect Chappelle is merely playing Mr. Nice Guy (and perhaps engaging in image enhancement) while Gondrys camera crew captures his every benevolent gesture. But the comics playful interactions with everyday folks come across as every bit as funny and unforced as his rehearsal room bantering with superstar celebs. Chappelle continues to pop up periodically throughout ""Block Party"" either as backstage kibitzer or on-stage introducer. (During one especially funny riff he pays tongue-in-cheek tribute to the magic of James Brown.) Ultimately however the music and the musicians are the main attractions here. Presented on Sept. 18 2004 in occasionally inclement weather the all-day concert includes stellar performances by the likes of Kanye West (tearing his way through ""Jesus Walks"" with messianic fervor) Erykah Badu (who matter-of-factly doffs her immense Afro wig after a brief rainfall) Dead Prez (swaggeringly militant with their ""Turn off the Radio"") and the Roots (backed by guest stars Kool G Rap and -- omigosh -- Big Daddy Kane). Aud response borders on the ecstatic when Chappelle intros a reunion of seminal hip-hoppers the Fugees -- including Lauryn Hill Wyclef Jean and Prakazrel ""Pras"" Michael -- who pleasingly perform their trademark cover of ""Killing Me Softly."" Using a small army of lensers armed with Super 16 cameras Gondry (a musicvideo vet) achieves an impressive degree of detail with a minimum of vertiginous hand-held excess. Sound quality is exceptional. Even so music fans might quibble about the relative brevity of some sets. Presumably there will be extended performances on the ultimate DVD release.
