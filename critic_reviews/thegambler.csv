Paramount Pictures Movies January 6 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Mark Wahlbergs grown so much in the last 15 years that you forget his limitations. He still cant show you whats happening inside a character. He needs dialogue. He needs somewhere to run. The Gambler gives him both but theyre both terrible. The dialogue never leaves the surface and the running across Los Angeles that happens in the last sequence is supposed to thrill you but its such a cliche that your embarrassment extends to the crew member who has to follow with the camera as Wahlberg chugs along. Wahlberg plays a casino rat named Jim Bennett. Jim owes more than a quarter of a million dollars to an assortment of dangerous men - including the owner of an underground gambling operation (Alvin Ing) and the two loan sharks (Michael K. Williams plays one; a very good very hairless John Goodman the other) whom he asks separately to bail him out. Standing at a blackjack table Wahlberg looks the part. He narrows his brow and slings his eyes around the room - at the security cameras at the dealer at the security guys in the distance - growing cockier whenever things go his way. This is a film about addiction and Wahlberg has to split the difference between the kick of turning 10000 into 80k and the kick in the gut of turning that into nothing. But anytime Wahlberg has to walk a fine line here to sketch out some interior world he can seem just sleepy. The characters sunglasses -- indoors outdoors -- are the equivalent of the actor asking to be graded on a curve. More Awards SeasonAll of our Oscar coverage The movie is a remake of a 1974 film with James Caan at the height of his runty virile stardom. James Toback wrote the script and tricked it out with all kinds of era-appropriate psychotherapeutic ponderousness. He was working loosely off of Dostoyevskys novel but with a slaggy grad student kind of narcissism. The reason the original sort of works (its not very good) is that director Karel Reisz has no personal stake in the dramas outcome. He does enough with Tobacks wanking so that ""masturbatory indulgence"" isnt the first term that comes to mind. He lets some naturalism come through but also some chaos and suspense and magnetism from Caan whose acting in the 1970s and early 1980s seemed to come entirely from his genitals. Burt Reynolds by comparison was cocky insinuation. Caan was all cock. I dont know why you would want to remake Reiszs movie. But Tobacks gassy delusions have a hold on the sort of macho-minded movie people who also want to be taken seriously as intellectual studs. The name of the Hollywood legend Irwin Winkler appears on both as a producer so theres that too. Still Even in Winklers part of town Hollywood is out of smart ideas. The French director Jacques Audiard turned Tobacks 1977 ""gangster plays concert piano"" drama Fingers with Harvey Keitel into The Beat That My Heart Skipped. The Paris setting made the preposterousness more palatable and less defensive. Tobacks writing always seems to be at war with itself. He was always out to prove that going to Harvard doesnt make you a pussy - unless it does. William Monahan who did the script for The Departed an adaptation of the Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs also adapted this one. All the personal class tension is gone from this new version which was directed by Rupert Wyatt (Rise of the Planet of the Apes). It has nothing to prove is several years too late for the televised poker boom of a couple of years ago and has no way of getting you to care about Jim. Everything about the movie is off. The camera keeps pointing to obvious information lest we miss something. Id rather be lost than have a movie hold my hand through every irrational flare-up as though addiction makes more sense on a leash. The ending of the 74 version with Caan pursuing a death wish at a Harlem whorehouse is as appalling as it is sick. But it was something. The new movie keeps the central tension of the 1974 version Jim is also a literature professor and novelist. In 74 it was a silly way to nod to Dostoyevskys thin influence. Here its a preposterous pretension that thats meant to be a crowning irony. In the big lecture hall the camera dances among the students and then pans up and reveals Jim ready to teach. But whats the class really about? Wahlberg sits on his desk at the bottom of the class then proceeds to stalk into the seats going on (and on) about the provenance of Shakespeares work. The sequence is meant to establish two things that Jim has (or once had) something to offer and squandered it and that the waitress we see in an early casino scene happens to be the best writer in the course. Shes played by Brie Larson whose best scene comes toward the start when she slowly pops her eyes at the sight of Wahlberg walking into a room to gamble. This is the sort of character who becomes worth living for even though the movie gives her no reason to feel that way. But boy if Jim doesnt waste an entire class putting down the other students in order to build her up. At some point Jim lays into a star basketball player (Anthony Kelley) for paying more attention to his smartphone than to Jims lectures. But as far as I can tell whoever hes texting has more to say. Wahlberg rushes through the speeches in these scenes like someone walking on hot coals. When you find out that Andre Braugher is playing the department head you think Theres an actor who can turn this water into wine. This is a movie that could have gotten away with its mediocre ambitions with the right star. But as good as Wahlberg can be hes wrong for bottoming out. You need to sense a self-revulsion or fear or a high anything but Wahlbergs lackadaisical approach. Wahlberg just seems petulant. Theres no stress to the performance probably because theres no stress to the movie (Monahan keeps the original movies thrown basketball game and the stakes for it feel ever lower here). Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon and even Ben Affleck dont mind looking desperate. Wahlberg puts off a kind of thuggy smugness thats too cool for suffering. Only when Jessica Lange shows up as his tortured gorgon of a mother does his recessive character makes sense. She doesnt leave any air in the room. Lange applies psychology to her work sometimes too much. But shes the only person who has been permitted to demonstrate any natural instincts to do any thinking at all.  Before The Door Pictures If you see only one new movie about a short handsome man running all over a city desperate for money dont make it The Gambler. Both that movie and A Most Violent Year operate at least partially under the influence of the 1970s filmmaking and thinking in different ways about how to make (and unmake) it in America. J.C. Chandors A Most Violent Year speaks more clearly to all the ideas of struggle and propriety and the inexorability of corruption. Chandor really has a grasp for big themes and knows why aside from certain imperatives of ego hes made his movie. Its set in 1981 and it watches as a Latino businessman named Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) tries to corner the market on New York Citys heating-oil wars. Thats as unsexy as it sounds. But as Abel (its pronounced ""AH-bell"") pushes entrepreneurship into empire Chandor matches the outward expansion with gorgeous Hollywood-style classicism that is rather sexy. One of Abels competitors keeps holding up his trucks and stealing the oil. The film opens with the first of two good suspenseful set pieces involving one of the drivers poor Julian (Elyes Gabel) under attack by a pair of goons. These are broad-daylight sequences and the editing by Ron Patane and smooth patient photography by the officially ingenious Bradford Young gives the scenes a sideways kind of tension. In the medium close-ups and long shots youre searching for trouble. Abel needs the heists to stop. Hes trying to close a deal on a major piece of waterfront property and needs the bank to continue to back his loan. But his drivers are spooked and theyre telling their teamster boss (Peter Gerety) that they need protection when they drive. No Abel says. Itll lead to warfare and a death would be placed at his feet. The films central tension is moral. Abel fancies himself above the scare tactics of the hoodlums his competitors fraternize with. He maintains so many delusions about the degrees of corruption and gangsterism required for certain kinds of business that hes blind to his own companys crimes. Abel and his attorney (Albert Brooks his hair looking very William Hurt) turn to the district attorney (David Oyelowo) for help but the DA warns them that hes days away from charging the company -- Standard Heating Oil -- with all kinds of tax evasion and fraud. Yes it seems Abels got Sidney Lumet-level urban chaos on his hands. But Chandor is also thinking about the Shakespearean origami of The Godfather films. To that end he has refolded Kay Corleones relationship to Michael. Now shes Lady Macbeth. Jessica Chastain plays Mrs. Morales a steely chic Brooklyn blonde named Anna. Abel purchased Standard from her father who we come to understand is a person to be feared. So too apparently is she. We never see her use the kitchen because shes busy cooking the books. When intruders violate the sanctity of their new modernist fortress in the woods and Abel gives chase with a bat in tow that proves inadequate for her. He wont arm himself so she does and when a ride home from a business dinner culminates with a crash its she who blasts away at the deer theyve hit. The echoes of Corleone and Macbeth might be a bit much but theyre entertaining. Anna only pops up here and there often with some kind of schemed-up surprise in store. So Chastain is free to make the cliche as hard and ruthless as she possibly can without tipping over into caricature. She can protect herself and the Morales familys three daughters but she leaves that to her man because in 1981 it is still the custom. Shell maintain the ruse ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan disguised as disco-era Debbie Harry. With a movie like this you need an actor who can maintain a fearsome center of gravity amid the stars shooting off in his midst. Isaac does it. He withstands Chastain; the excellent Gabel; Alessandro Nivola who plays an oil rival with about three excellent scenes; and Annie Funke as the least likely of oil dons. Isaac has become the sort of actor who really might be able to do anything. Much of it goes beyond pure technique though hes strong in that department too. Isaac just has an uncanny ability to adjust the volume on his acting often so that you forget thats what hes doing. As Abel he wears great suits and coats. His gray hair has been given height and body. Hes not a big man. Hes as small as Caan and Wahlberg and Al Pacino whom he most evokes here. And like Pacino at his young finest Isaac whos 35 knows how to make himself seem much bigger than he is. It isnt that you have to fear Abel. You have to respect him. He has to seem capable of both decency and criminality. Isaac conflates the two in a way that gives Abel considerable power. This is best performance Pacino didnt give in the 1980s. If only the movie were doing more than diagramming the rise of a tycoon. Chandor gives a film about business some intriguing racial undergirding with Abel desperate to maintain the appearance of class of being upstanding probably because he presumes no one expects that of him. Assimilation is inevitable. Decorum is a weapon. The light Hispanic accent Isaac gives to the character contrasts with the more pronounced accent of Gabels Julian an immigrant who desperately wants to stop driving and start making sales. But when Julian asks to do so hes in the worst physical condition banged up and on crutches after the accident. The assumption is that hes too battered to makes house calls. As the film builds into a divergent tale of luck and ambition and aptitude you realize that Julian is just too foreign and too brown to convince white people to change their heating supplier. The movie runs just over two hours and Chandor keeps the movie almost antiseptically tight. Hes proving to be a smart director whose skill is growing astronomically in three movies (hes gone from Margin Call to All Is Lost to this in four years). If he were an athlete Id have my suspicions about the source of that strength. But at the movies youre grateful to have him. He respects an audience enough to assume theyll stay with him and hes a fluid enough storyteller that you very much want to keep up. But right now especially here his classicism is too clean. He doesnt pass up an opportunity to remind you that the film is a tale about America (the haunting closing-credits number by Alex Ebert is called ""American"") like Godfather or Scarface. He can be didactic in that way returning to a theme as though hes participating in an oral exam. The movie is missing the risk of making Julian say the Cain to Isaacs Abel of giving over a third of the movie to flesh him out. Its a John Cazale part that probably needs Cazales writing. If Chandors going to play with these ideas of temptation disillusionment and betrayal he should give the movie the biblical scope it needs for greatness. Hes more than sound as a thinking director. Hes vital. But he leaves you yearning for something bigger hotter. What he could use more of is soul.

Comments click to enlarge The Gambler Video Rated R  111 minutes  2014 Mark Wahlberg stars in this remake of James Tobacks 1974 debut film as a once-promising novelist whose career has petered out and whose gambling addiction has gotten him into trouble with a fearsome loan shark. Though Wahlberg is a fine actor theres no way I can buy him as a college English professor holding forth on Shakespeare and Camus. This hews closely to Tobacks signature blend of erudition and machismo with an assortment of enjoyably overwritten larger-than-life supporting characters (John Goodman as a crabby bon-mot-dispensing mob boss and Michael Kenneth Williams as a smooth bon-mot-dispensing gangster).

He can do desperation well but hes not exactly a smartest-guy-in-the-room kind of actor. 138 Shares Share 103 Tweet 29 Share 0 Share Email Print Share Is casting Mark Wahlberg as a self-loathing literature professor an inspired or ridiculous choice? Can it be both? Its hard to decide even after seeing The Gambler director Rupert Wyatt and screenwriter William Monahans re-imagining of Karel Reisz and writer James Tobacks 1974 film. The original story though it shares some rough similarities with Dostoevskys novella The Gambler was inspired by Tobacks own life as a moneyed Harvard grad and City College lecturer whose own gambling addictions are well documented. His career since has focused on documenting personalities living between seemingly opposite extremes. (In Fingers the first and best film Toback directed Harvey Keitel played a concert pianist who worked as a bag man for the mob.) As the never-smiling tormented Jim Bennett Wahlberg gets to put his characteristic glower to good use. By night he hangs out in dark rooms where the dress code appears simply to be ""black"" winning and losing scads of money on blackjack and roulette without so much as a blink. Hes now in trouble with two brutal loan shark/crime lords and by the end of the film hell be in debt to another.A By day he is a talented take-no-prisoners literature professor and failed novelist prone to long monologues before his class about existentialism suicide and the unfair distribution of talent. This guy is the ultimate buzzkill When a student brings up the notion that Shakespeare might not have written the plays credited to him Jim goes off about how ""what lies behind every Shakespeare controversy is rage"" -- at the fact that someone so low-bred so unassuming could be so talented -- and then points out the only student in his entire class who he thinks has the requisite talent to succeed at literature. (Surprise shes played by Brie Larson who also happens to work at those gambling establishments Jim frequents and who has the hots for him.)To Jim life seems to be a clutter of roles we play -- disguises really -- to avoid the fundamental emptiness at our core. Appropriately Wyatt (whose previous film was the wonderful 2011 sci-fi reboot Rise of the Planet of the Apes) drains his images of color and warmth. This is a chilly blue-gray-black monolith of a movie occasionally beautiful and cool but often forbidding and cruel in its bleakness. That extends to the supporting cast as well. As the trio of loan sharks hounding Bennett all of them philosophers in their own way Michael Kenneth Williams Alvin Ing and John Goodman all get to stoically expound upon the meaninglessness of life. Theyre not characters -- theyre existential facts. a""Wahlberg has more range than he gets credit for but hes not entirely right for the extremes of this part. He can do desperation well but hes not exactly a smartest-guy-in-the-room kind of actor. He did make for a brilliant motormouth though in Martin Scorseses The Departed which Monahan also wrote; there he gave the writers elaborate verbal assaults an almost physical force spitting them out like daggers at pretty much anybody who came along. Here however the daggers are pointed inward. The characters self-loathing and self-destructiveness arent even the films subtext; theyre its text. Wahlberg gives it the old college try -- this is the most present hes been in a part in ages and its always fun to watch himA -- but he also struggles with the nonstop verbal curlicues of Monahans script. The words have force but they dont sound like theyre his. At the same time it could be argued that this part calls more for a brute than an intellectual. Theres a physical component to it Bennett is a man in debt to three very brutal loan sharks who thumbs his nose at these criminals as he toys with their money.A James Caan who played the role in the (admittedly very different) 1974 film wasnt exactly anybodys idea of a pointy-headed deep thinker either.A This is someone putting himself in physical danger over and over again. AndA so Wahlberg grows into the part. He may not be right as a precocious self-loathing intellectual but hes very much at home playing a dickhead whos gotten in too deep. And as The Gambler becomes less about its protagonists dashed intellectualism and more about the gathering danger of his predicament the film gains power.

But theres no such thing as a Hollywood movie without ideology and the ideology this one expresses is that of a wistful lost masculinity of reckless but pampered bad boys charismatic antiheroes who read books and write the stories of their own destruction.Mark Wahlberg of all actors plays a college professor named Jim Bennett who has a sports car a shag haircut and a wardrobe of slim-cut blazers and who gets in way too deep with dangerous gangsters. John Goodman gets to do both his patented bad-guy performance and his patented best-friend performance as the most dangerous of all possible gangsters who for unclear male-bonding reasons becomes Jims guardian angel. ""The Gambler"" is not by any measure a terrible movie but its an odd one to encounter at the end of a year so dominated by intense and heated discussions of gender politics a vision of male depravity and decadence that also comes with a wide-eyed boyish innocence. Maybe thats not surprising since this picture is a remake of an almost-iconic one with the same title made in 1974 which starred James Caan and Lauren Hutton and marked the screenwriting debut of legendary Hollywood bad boy James Toback.Theres no question that the original ""Gambler"" is better. It feels rooted in time and place in a way this new version cant quite manage and it wasnt constructed as a vehicle for a movie stars image makeover. But thats not to say the peculiar 2014 rebuild ""Gambler"" directed with considerable flair by Rupert Wyatt (""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"") doesnt offer plenty of color and its own esoteric charms. Casting Wahlberg as a wisecracking fast-talking intellectual who is as comfortable discussing ""Hamlet"" Albert Camus and existentialism as he is plunking down 40 grand on a single blackjack hand certainly required bravado. Whether or not it pays off the onetime Boston knucklehead is very likable in the part and does not embarrass himself.I mean no I havent seen too many English professors with Jims sharp-dressed-man affect (or his high-end BMW) although that might have been vaguely more believable in 1974. Also I dont really grasp what area of academic expertise would include teaching a course on Shakespeare and a course that involves Camus - but ditto as to 1974. Given that every aspect of Jims persona is projected male fantasy those are silly objections. He can teach whatever the hell he wants; hes not a real person. Camus and Hamlet are in there of course to underline the idea that Jim has chosen his own road to perdition. Hes a good-looking white guy from a wealthy L.A. family who has had every educational opportunity and every form of privilege and is expressing his existential freedom by getting repeatedly beaten up by criminals of other races. You Might Also Like When his story begins Jim is already hundreds of thousands in debt to a sinister Asian gambling tycoon and doubles down on that by borrowing money from an African-American gangster actually called Neville Baraka (Michael Kenneth Williams). He identifies the one undergraduate (Brie Larson) in his orbit with obvious literary talent and then shamelessly hits on her. He yearns to be broke fired beaten to a pulp and killed in no particular order or at least to be set free from the oppressive destiny of being himself. Wahlberg brings a guileless unquenchable spark to the role - ""convincing"" is really the wrong standard to apply - perhaps because he has no idea how hackneyed and nostalgic this vision of masculine escape is. Its like Charles Bukowski as retold by Bret Easton Ellis and then summarized in Playboy.Wyatt is a capable director with a good sense of space who keeps the train humming from one horizontal California location to the next but leaves time for loquacious irrelevant side trips in true 70s Hollywood fashion. (The movie is set now but might as well not be.) Jessica Lange shows up a couple of times as Jims brine-pickled mother either refusing to bail him out or offering money he will promptly squander. Goodman an accomplished veteran at rescuing scenes in the most dire of motion pictures plays a forbidding mountain of flesh the Lucifer of Jims journey into hell offering him a final choice between redemption and annihilation. William Monahans rewrite of Tobacks original screenplay uneasily bounces off our contemporary sense that gambling addiction is a disease and that somebody like Jim has no control over his behavior - which is pretty much the opposite of whats conveyed by all that existential hoo-ha. The original Toback-Caan film (directed by Karel Reisz) rested on the idea that everything the main character does is an expression of freedom and also on a 19th-century romantic conception of gambling as a profound metaphor for Life or Fate or whatever. Now it just seems like a really stupid reason to get into trouble. Some fragments of that Dostoevskian romance linger on here Just enough so that Wyatt and Wahlberg nail the climactic scene when Jim is literally playing for his life and make it momentarily seem to mean something. But not quite enough that youll remember what that something might be the next day. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Wordy and stylish but ultimately vapid.Mark Wahlberg and Brie Larson in ""The Gambler.""(Photo Claire Folger/Paramount Pictures/ AP)Story Highlights2 stars (out of 5)Wahlberg plays a literature professor and gambling addict who gets in too deep with the wrong guys.""The Gambler"" a remake of the 1974 film of the same name is wordy stylish but ultimately vapid.John Goodman plays a foul-mouthed bathhouse loan shark the movies chief delight.Every gambler knows that scoring a real payoff requires putting up real stakes. But not ""The Gambler"" a bloodless remake of the 1974 film of the same name. The original is a gritty bit of character study in which James Caan puts his soul at hazard to find his fix. Mark Wahlberg doesnt put up anything so valuable as that and the return is as miniscule as the stakes.Wahlberg plays Jim Bennett a literature professor by day and a high roller at night cutting decks in the Korean underworld of exotic gambling dens. Before you can say ""hit me"" he has racked up a 240000 debt that the Korean boss wants paid back in a week or else.So the days start ticking and Bennett who cant hope to come up with that much scratch on his own spirals into shameless self-destruction. He racks up more debt with another high roller named Neville (Michael K. Williams) a bad guy with a bad side you dont want to land on.Bennett burrows deeper into his self-dug grave with moneylender Frank (John Goodman) who as a foul-mouthed bathhouse loan shark is the movies chief delight. Frank will pay off Bennetts debts with the threat that if he doesnt make his payments on time Frank will kill everyone Bennett has ever loved.Whats to save a man who has gotten in so deep? Why the love of a good woman of course. Not his rich mother (played with icy resolve by Jessica Lange); neither can stand the other it seems.No his saving grace is Amy (Brie Larson) the best and brightest of his students a cutely disheveled bespectacled fiction writer (something like 20 years his junior) who cleans up nice and slings cocktails in Bennetts preferred gambling den. In on his secret life she becomes a sort of confessor and regards every terrible thing Bennett says and does with a wry smile because what dame doesnt love a rogue?The problem with Bennett as the central figure in a character study is that its impossible to believe this is a character who could actually exist. Every detail rings false. Wahlberg has fashioned here a rock-star English teacher who commands his classroom less like John Keating and more like Mick Jagger. He casually drops the word ""obstreperous."" He wears tailored black clothes that look more suitable for a nightclub. He comes across as the sort of slick playboy you cant imagine even knowing who Camus is except that he wrote a book whose title ""The Stranger"" makes for a weighty metaphorical backdrop to rant and rail against.The film pays lip service to the concepts of nihilism and willful self-destruction. But Bennett is a character who is so clearly in love with himself that you dont even flinch when he pulls out a gun and a bottle of whiskey.The film has its charms. The actors clearly love chewing on Oscar-winning-screenwriter William Monahans lines; he also penned ""The Departed"" and this film shares that ones arabesque verbal style. A character actor as great as Goodman can have a lot of fun with that.But all that swagger undermines character. You cant get close to Bennett -- not because hes a morally ambiguous character as the movie would have you believe but because he never puts anything on the table. He struts through every consequence a man with nothing to lose because he never had anything worth losing in the first place.The Gambler2 stars (out of 5) Director Rupert Wyatt.Cast Mark Wahlberg Jessica Lange Brie Larson.Rating R for language throughout and some sexuality/nudity.Reach the reporter at barbara.vandenburgharizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8371.

The second is the ticking of a clock. And although thats where the movie starts those sounds never really end -- because luck and time and what happens to us when both run out are what the movie is really all about. The film is based on a (better) 1974 movie from Karel Reisz and James Toback and centers on Jim Bennett an incredibly obnoxious English professor and degenerate gambler who loses huge sums of money in illegal games of chance. Bennetts favorite game is blackjack; his favorite bet is ""double or nothing."" This is not just a suckers bet but a suicides; to play it over and over as Bennett does is like playing six rounds of Russian roulette. Theres no way youre going to get up from that table. But Bennett seems to want to die or at least punish himself and so he keeps diving further and further into the abyss. It makes the movie a hard one to stay interested in. In the original film James Caan was half Dostoevsky character half Gamblers Anonymous newbie; we saw the intentional self-degradation but also the impossible unquenchable craving. But here Bennett -- played by Mark Wahlberg -- seems as mechanical as that spinning roulette wheel or ticking clock. Every dollar that comes into his hands he throws away while we sit and watch. Its not that hes out of control either -- hes in complete control. Hes just determined to destroy himself. There have been a few movies like that -- ""Leaving Las Vegas"" comes to mind -- but theyre hard to pull off. If someone is really that intent on self-destruction why should we be his audience? Wahlberg though is always watchable even hiding behind his sunglasses. He swaggers sitting down and although he comes across as the worst English teacher ever he does look like the sort of person who would pick a fight with three bigger guys. (And then after picking himself up off the floor mouth off at them again.) And there are a few other surprises in the cast (not least the brief appearance of the venerable George Kennedy in the first few minutes). The always fierce Jessica Lange is indelible in her few biting scenes as Bennetts disgusted mother. And a mammoth John Goodman is more formidable than ever as a chrome-domed loan shark giving hard advice on what it really means to be a man in this world. Frankly the film would be better if there was more of them; you feel the drama deflate a little when they leave. And while director Rupert Wyatt (being rewarded here for rebooting the ""Planet of the Apes"" franchise) does show some style and an unusual taste in music the films sense of place seems off - the gambling joints Wahlberg wanders through dont seem real or surreal just giant sets (a little overpopulated with Asian stereotypes too). But then the original ""The Gambler"" was taken very much from screenwriter Tobacks own experiences as a writer teacher and cardplayer; this is taken from a script by William Monahan the author of ""The Departed."" Hes very good with ornately aggressive tough guy dialogue but theres little real life here; ultimately hes writing about an idea not a person. And although that roulette wheel is spinning -- and that clock is definitely ticking -- the film never quite delivers on time. Ratings note The film contains strong language violence substance abuse and John Goodman in a sauna. The Gambler (R) Paramount (111 min.) Directed by Rupert Wyatt. With Mark Wahlberg.

"The Gambler rolls the dice on a remake review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Gambler rolls the dice on a remake review In The Gambler a film that roles the dice on a remake its instructive that the classic novel which Mark Wahlbergs fatalistic English professor teaches to his university class is Albert Camus LEtranger.A gaunt Mark Wahlberg left and a menacing John Goodman star in The Gambler.  (Claire Folger / THE ASSOCIATED PRESS)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticWed. Dec. 24 2014The Gambler Starring Mark Wahlberg John Goodman Brie Larson Michael K. Williams and Jessica Lange. Directed by Rupert Wyatt. Opens Dec. 25 at GTA theatres. 111 minutes. 14AIn The Gambler a film that roles the dice on a remake its both instructive and obvious that the classic novel which Mark Wahlbergs fatalistic English professor teaches to his university class is Albert Camus LEtranger.With a title that translates as The Stranger (or perhaps more accurately as The Outsider in some editions) its an existential story about a man named Meursault who is completely indifferent to his fate ""Since were all going to die its obvious that when and how dont matter.""Article Continued BelowThats exactly the frame of mind of the professor Jim Bennett who gambles away money with such breathtaking abandon it brings looks of amazement and words of caution even from ruthless loan sharks.""I think youre the kind of guy who likes to lose"" says a shark named Neville played by Michael K. Williams after seeing Bennett speedily squander a fortune in an underground casino.""Lifes a losing proposition"" counters Bennett who channels his inner Meursault as he sets out to further prove his cynical statement.The Gambler is Rupert Wyatts remake of a 1974 film by the same name starring James Caan and rewritten by a then-unknown James Toback and it neither improves on nor discredits the original.Not that Wyatt was setting out to do that his impulse instead being to find a character-driven story as artistic counterweight to his blockbuster success with 2011s Rise of the Planet of the Apes.This certainly is one driven narrative. Wahlberg reportedly lost 60 lbs. for the role and his gaunt look makes Jim seem all the more haunted as he repeatedly throws away vast sums on games of chance.They are sums that he cant afford even after his well-to-mother (Jessica Lange) tosses him a financial lifeline. Jim owes hundreds of thousands of dollars to guys like Neville and to the menacing Frank (John Goodman) who wouldnt hesitate to pull the trigger on a deadbeat debtor but who would rather not be assisting a suicide.Their continuing amazement over Jims apparent death wish is one of the films more interesting aspects with Goodman being especially good as a figure both menacing and caring. He recognizes the demons within.Whats the motivation for this insanity? Is it the unresolved father/son issues suggested by Jims lack of emotion for the death of his stern papa (George Kennedy)? Is Jim existentially bummed over his inability to achieve greatness either as a teacher novelist or gambler? ""If youre not a genius dont bother"" he tells his students.Is he just trying to impress Amy (Brie Larson) the student who may become something more to him if hes willing or able to open himself to her?Wyatt and screenwriter William Monahan offer resolution of sorts but ultimately the film brings to mind Camus/Mersaults famous observation about the ""benign indifference of the universe.""The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

(AP Photo/Paramount Pictures Claire Folger) Jim Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) likes to gamble and hes good at it -- up to a point. Bennett doesnt know when to stop piling up impressive winnings only to consistently lose the whole bundle. Its his compulsion and his curse and its liable to get him killed.Hes the kind of guy that criminal types dont mind betting on. Among them are the philosophical Frank (John Goodman) and the no-nonsense Neville (Michael Kenneth Williams). Bennett winds up owing both men a lot of money which forces him to turn to his well-heeled but emotionally distant mother Roberta (Jessica Lange) for a bailout. Its not the first time and shes growing weary of his behavior.When hes not gambling on his future and his life Bennett is an associate professor of literature who addresses his students in a manner thats part mentor and part talk-show host. The most promising one Amy (Brie Larson) is clearly attracted to him -- and aware that theres more going on with him than finding the time to grade papers. But Bennett is in such deep trouble that he may not be around long enough to pursue a relationship.""The Gambler"" is a moderately entertaining but frankly unnecessary remake of a 1974 film of the same name that starred James Caan and was directed by Karel Reisz from a screenplay by James Toback. The remake was directed by Rupert Wyatt (""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"") and reunites Wahlberg with William Monahan screenwriter of ""The Departed."" In a role that would have been ideal for Tom Cruise in psycho mode Wahlberg is merely OK. Unfortunately the films effectiveness turns on whether we buy into his angst. And Larson has very little to play. But Goodman and Williams are believably menacing and Lange is perfect as Bennetts mom of steel. Is ""The Gambler"" the kind of film that most people want to see during the holidays?

In the year-end glut of holiday films a lot of new ones will be around to keep you entertained but The New York Observer wont. Im off to wrap some gifts ring some bells and get some sleep. Well return with our first issue of a brand new year on January 7. Meanwhile heres a rundown of whats coming in the weeks ahead. UNBROKEN Put this one at the top of your must-see list. Angelina Jolie might not in my opinion have yet reached the heights of the acting profession but with this passionate inspired technically awesome and profoundly exciting chronicle of the life of Louie Zamperini the American Olympic athlete who survived 47 days in a lifeboat and two years as a Japanese prisoner of war during World War II she rises to the top rank of first-class film directors in a male-dominated field overcrowded with hacks. Beginning with a troubled childhood as the son of Italian immigrants in California Louie was an outsider who seemed destined for a life of crime but it was the guidance of an older brother that gave him a talisman to live by ""If I can take it I can make it."" Played with enormous charisma and extraordinary physical endurance by rising U.K. newcomer and inevitable future star Jack OConnell Louie moves from the 1936 Olympic games in Berlin to the rank of pilot shot down with two comrades and left wounded and bleeding in the shark-infested waters of the Pacific. Then the capture by the Japanese Navy--plunged into an underground hole where he listened to his best friend being tortured and finally found himself the personal victim of a sadistic commandant (played unflinchingly by the Japanese singer-composer Miyavi) who subjected him to years of unflagging brutality. Angelina Jolies Unbroken tells the story of P.O.W. Louie Zamperini. Its hard to believe anyone could survive inhumanities this severe and still live but Louie earned a Purple Heart realized his dream of attending one last Olympics (in Japan of all places) and went on to tell his story in the critically acclaimed biography Unbroken by Laura Hillenbrand which spent 180 weeks on the best-seller list before becoming the source material for this remarkable screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen Richard LaGravenese and William Nicholson. Ms. Jolies obsession with Louie who died in July at age 97 informs every scene. The air strikes and raft and camp sequences hold equal weight the camerawork by Roger Deakins is magnificent and the vast supporting cast of unknowns including Domhnall Gleeson Garrett Hedlund Finn Wittrock and Luke Treadaway is exemplary. Although it eschews the usual P.O.W. camp cliches Unbroken is probably too grim brutal and depressing for most viewers and the decision to open it on Christmas Day is questionable. But as a tribute to one heros fortitude in refusing to give in to evil it gives off its own admirable feeling of positive spiritual energy that left me feeling good about the best qualities of mankind. One of the finest achievements of the 2014 film year. AMERICAN SNIPER Another war biopic opening on Christmas day with tight two-fisted direction by Clint Eastwood and a compelling centerpiece performance by Bradley Cooper as a Texas rodeo cowboy full of anger and rage who channels his natural-born killer instincts into a life of positive aggression fighting terrorists as Chris Kyle Americas most decorated Navy SEAL. On his first day of duty hes assigned to protect the Marines from enemy snipers killing a woman and a child carrying a grenade in the bargain. From there on his constant raids on Muslim homes grow more repetitive as the mans civilian problems lead to panic and impotence. After four tours of duty 1000 days on the battlefield and 163 kills Chris comes home for good but the psychological damage has been severe. Clint Eastwood directs American Sniper starring Bradley Cooper. With this film Mr. Eastwood seems to dedicate his hawks eye vision of ""supporting the troops"" to an unpopular continuation of the ongoing war in Iraq but his direction has none of the vigor of either of his previous war efforts Flags of Our Fathers and Letters From Iwo Jima. Bradley Cooper imbues Chris Kyle with the sensitivity charm and adrenalin lacking elsewhere in Jason Halls screenplay and Sienna Miller is very good as his long-suffering wife Taya. But theres no freshness in either the domestic scenes or the combat sequences that all look like outtakes from The Hurt Locker. The locales do at least look authentic though Iraq is played by Morocco. SELMA This somber by-the-numbers movie about Martin Luther King co-produced by Oprah Winfrey is not just about the man the speech or the holiday--but also the ideals and fight for dignity that led to the Nobel Prize. Race relations are still a dangerous and sensitive subject after all these years especially in light of recent headlines about racial profiling and the riots in Ferguson and other cities. But as vital as it is racial strife is a subject that cries out for a more volatile treatment than this. The Alabama marching sequences and resulting violence filmed in Selma where they actually happened are too understated for my taste. And the home life of King and his vacillating wife Coretta are muted. While he rallied for federal legislation guaranteeing every person in America the right to vote regardless of color he was opposed by the White House and denounced by J. Edgar Hoover and the F.B.I. as a political and moral degenerate. Yet he turned the other cheek until his own people challenged his sincerity. Words from the Bible still dont carry any more weight  today than they did against the whips Remingtons and helicopters that captivated and polarized a nation in the 1960s. Everyone is just too damn polite Still director Ava DuVernay has done a commendable job of enlightening American school kids about a chapter in history theyve both ignored and forgotten. And theres a powerfully nuanced and award-worthy performance by David Oyelowo as Martin Luther King. THE GAMBLER Another wet battery about a week in the life of a gambling addict with a jaundiced-looking Mark Wahlberg as a Los Angeles loser who owes 240000 to various and sundry mobsters illegal gambling rings and bail bondsmen who beat him to bloody hamburger and give him seven days to pay--or end up in the La Brea tar pits. By day hes a failed novelist-turned-associate professor of English Literature by night a hopeless loser who even wipes out his own mother (a hard venomous wasted Jessica Lange) to stake him to another roll of the roulette wheel. This is a remake of a 1974 bomb with James Caan based on a book by James Toback with overtones of Dostoevsy director Rupert Wyatt (Rise of the Planet of the Apes) is too inert and nuance-free to detect. Richard Brooks made a tougher and much better film about the tragedy of compulsive gambling in his 1985 film Fever Pitch and in 1949s The Lady Gambles even Barbara Stanwyck made a more convincing fall from respectability into casino hell than Mark Wahlberg does here. BIG EYES Tim Burtons penchant for the bizarre well serves this odd investigation of the scandal behind the marriage of artist Margaret Keane who created a kitschy world of popular but widely reviled paintings of bereft waifs with huge myopic eyes that sold like proverbial hotcakes (but were far less appetizing) and her ambitious money-hungry and manipulative husband Walter Keane who claimed to be the actual artist using his wifes success to steal the fame and fortune for himself. She was putty in his hands a pushover who went along with his schemes even allowing him to sign his own name to her work until she finally spilled the beans and sued him for slander. Amy Adams stars as Margaret Keane in Big Eyes. After years of bickering and a fair amount of illegitimate larceny the marriage came to a screeching public halt in a courtroom battle where the judge forced the estranged parties to stand before two blank canvases and prove the legitimacy of their claims. (Its the best scene in the picture.) Walter (gregarious Christoph Waltz delightfully oozing insincere charm) died in 2000 broke but still insisting he was no phony. Margaret (Amy Adams unrecognizable in a bottle-blond wig) fled to Hawaii (a perfect place for bad art) opened a new gallery and still paints every day. More subdued than usual Tim Burton presents both a creepy view of a disastrous marriage and an indictment of the tasteless commercial 1950s art scene where goofy fads seduced ignorant collectors into clamoring for ugly ornaments to match their living room walls. Nimble off the beaten track and very entertaining its the cinematic equivalent of a lava lamp. MR. TURNER This film focuses on a different kind of artist--the Victorian radical J.M.W. Turner whose vast spreads of landscapes and sailing ships vanishing into muted mists were largely dismissed in 1845 as a big waste of oil. Queen Victoria thought they were ugly. I agree with Vicky. But this prosaic and vapid bore by long-winded critically overpraised director Mike Leigh is even worse--a vacuous endurance test about an abstract loser struggling for recognition among the Impressionists of his time although we are told he is now considered an Old Master who hangs in museums (the Met owns a few) who influenced Monet and was once defended by Thackeray. He is now defended by movie critics although the reasons are specious--mainly because he is played in this droning yawn by bulbous double-chinned character actor Timothy Spall. Timothy Spall as J.M.W. Turner. The real Turner we are told was a cruel doleful and irritating heel who frittered away his time in seedy brothels insulted the cherished artists of the day and deserted his family leaving them penniless and neglected while he occasionally indulged in bad sex with his pickle-faced hunchback housekeeper. Later he took up with a widowed landlady who rented rooms in the remote port village of Margate where he went to paint whales. With this slow-moving film as evidence--the weirdly overrated equivalent to watching a mud puddle dry--there was nothing remotely interesting about anything he did in life that is worth making a two-hour-plus movie about. Mr. Spall winner of the Cannes and New York Film Critics Circle best-actor awards does his best to bring an unpleasant character to life--grunting and snorting like a boar ready to charge spitting on his canvases and dragging around with a constant wince like a fat baby with colic. With all due respect hes too repulsive to watch for 150 minutes. INTO THE WOODS The new Disney extravaganza Rob Marshall (Chicago) has made of the Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine musical is another example of concept over coherence but the entertainment value is considerable. Mr. Sondheim explores the only terrain left to us in which optimism and magic are still possible in a world gone psychotically sour--the landscape of fairy tales. And then he turns enchanted dreams into terrifying nightmares only Freud could understand. Dont take the children. Mr. Marshall uses several interlocking tales to plunge us into the woods of our imagination--three Grimm classics about Cinderella Little Red Riding Hood and Jack and the Beanstalk--plus a newly invented one about a childless baker and his wife (James Corden and Emily Blunt) who can lift an evil witchs curse if they can deliver to the old crone Cinderellas slipper Reds red cape and Jacks cow. The witch throws in Rapunzels golden hair too just to make the task more difficult. This first act long but engaging is nothing more than a merry scavenger hunt which also introduces a corny Big Bad Wolf (Johnny Depp) two handsome mixed-up princes (Chris Pine for Cinderella Billy Magnussen for Rapunzel) Cinderellas wicked stepmother (a hilarious Christine Baranski) and Meryl Streep acting all over the place as the flaky sentimental and always exhausted witch. Their stories intertwine as they trip through an enchanted forest that looks like a thicket of marzipan pretzels. Chris Pine stars as Cinderellas Prince in Into the Woods. Then in Act Two the characters get what the Sondheim-Lapine team thinks they deserve--and nobody lives happily ever after. So its back ""into the woods"" again to confront such jet-age traumas as moral disintegration deception lies betrayal disillusionment fear cowardice regrets doomed relationships failed marriages and death. The woods become such a jumble of gnarled ideas and convoluted metaphors that we quickly lose our way--and our interest. The witch loses her powers Cinderellas prince turns out to be a heel (""I was raised to be charming not sincere"") and the wife of the giant Jack returns to wreak havoc. The point of all this pseudo-intellectual gardening I suppose is to prove that fairy tales do not have happy endings and be careful what you wish for because it might make you miserable. The book is a maze in which there is no door marked ""EXIT"" the best songs like ""Children Will Listen"" and ""You Are Not Alone"" are scattered like bits of dialogue and sound derivative of songs from other Sondheim scores. Still there is much to admire here from the candyfloss costumes to the tricky special effects and the thrill of hearing everyone sing surprisingly well. (Anna Kendrick has a gorgeous soprano and Chris Pine displays wit and a musical range I never thought possible.) I left disenchanted and irritated by so many missed opportunities. Fairy tales do have happy endings despite what Mr. Sondheim might say to the contrary. And there is something wrong with any dramatized fairy tale set to music if when you go away the score is so forgettable that theres nothing to hum but the beanstalk. See you in January.

Mark Wahlberg shows grim determination as Jim Bennett in ""The Gambler."" (Claire Folger / Paramount Pictures) Mark OlsenContact Reporter The Gambler takes some filmmaking risks but it eventually falls short by failing to go all in A remake of the 1974 film of the same name ""The Gambler"" stars Mark Wahlberg as a man who charts a course of self-destruction aiming to reset his life by losing everything having found life as a college literature professor born to a wealthy family too much to bear. Everybodys got their problems.The original film directed by Karel Reisz from a script by James Toback that dovetailed a semi-autobiographical story with one by Dostoevsky and starring James Caan is an example of the kind of pungent atmospheric character studies now venerated as a golden age of 1970s American filmmaking. Relocated from New York to Los Angeles and directed by Rupert Wyatt (""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"") from a screenplay adapted by William Monahan (""The Departed"") the new version can be seen as aspiring to be an analogue to that earlier style most interested in fashioning itself into an existential examination of modern manhood and its discontents. Wahlberg lost about 60 pounds to hollow out his body for the role of Jim Bennett who has unraveled as his dreams of being a novelist or much of anything have slipped away. Having lost himself in the cliffs-edge rush of gambling -- anything he can bet on -- the momentary precipice where any outcome is possible he has racked up a monumental debt to three separate underworld heavies played with tangy zeal by John Goodman Alvin Ing and Michael Kenneth Williams. He is given seven days to make good.Bennetts story seems rooted in some death-drive fantasy to strip away the trappings of identity and privilege to start over from zero. Where Caan in the original came at the part with exuberant razzmatazz recklessness Wahlberg never seems to be having any fun choosing instead to amplify the characters grim determination. By suppressing Wahlbergs more typical sparkling unpredictability this new reading of the character recasts him into someone more frustrating than free. The characters only solace comes from a promising student played by Brie Larson the young actress who gained attention last year for her role as a troubled youth counselor in ""Short Term 12."" There is a lightness a liveliness to Larsons performance in distinction to Wahlbergs heavy harrumphing. She is introduced by simply a look her bright eyes recognizing Wahlberg without speaking when she sees him come into the underground gambling den where she works as a cocktail waitress. Larsons bright presence pushes to the edges of the role only underscoring the ways in which it is underwritten. Mark Wahlberg is a chance-taker; one of his biggest is The Gambler Steven Zeitchik In 2003 Mark Wahlberg walked into the Santa Monica offices of HBO with an idea for a series.

(Steven Zeitchik) That he sees in her a freshness and potential still out in front of the compromises and limitations that have overtaken him seems clear even as her own reasons for getting involved with someone in an obvious downward spiral remain opaque. The films lean toward romantic redemption is arguably its most significant change from the original in which Lauren Hutton played a party girl ill-suited for Caans character of Axel Freed.The story comes most alive in confrontational scenes between Wahlberg and Jessica Lange as his mother. There is a tension as Lange brings out a playfulness from Wahlberg an undertone of brattiness that is missing from the deflated weariness of the rest of his performance. Scenes of Wahlberg lecturing his students on literature and life talent and failure are spirited and fun but feel tacked-on and a tad indulgent.

(Glenn Whipp) One wants to encourage filmmakers such as Wyatt and stars such as Wahlberg to step off the treadmill of mega-budget special-effects spectaculars to make films that explore the messy effects of human behavior. Yet taking creative risks like gambling means the possibility of failure. Throughout it is as if the filmmakers are trying to have it both ways making something that is alienating but not entirely so walking up to the idea of being difficult without crossing into being unpleasant. Wyatt Monahan and Wahlberg never seem quite settled on what they want to say with the character or the story so the film feels marked not by ambiguity but uncertainty. The original film at least had a sense of conviction in the way it steadily narrowed its focus on the characters downfall while the remake looks for wiggle room an angle an out.

"Gambler The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; gambler-the ) Gambler The (United States 2014) December 24 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli The Gambler is a solid remake - a film that retraces the path of the original while carving out its own identity. The 2014 iteration isnt as good as its 1974 predecessor but it offers its share of small pleasures not the least of which is the crisp sharp dialogue that never loses its punch even when it veers close to the edge of pretentiousness. The autopsy of a mans gambling addiction is unflinchingly true and although the ending has been changed to reflect a softer less cynical resolution it nevertheless seems appropriate for the material. Mark Wahlberg plays Jim Bennett a university English lit professor whose in-class lectures are invested with passion. His class is comprised mainly of students looking to fill out their core liberal arts curriculum like basketball standout Lamar Allen (Anthony Kelley). There are a few however who are there because they care about writing and reading such as Amy Phillips (Brie Larson) who is singled out by Jim as the best writer in the class - before he embarks upon a doomed quasi-romantic relationship with her. Away from the classroom Jims lone passion is for cards. He blows more at the table in one night than many men earn in several years and he finds himself deep in debt and sinking. His mother Roberta (Jessica Lange) is rich but shes reluctant to be an enabler until she realizes that without a handout her son is likely to be the lead story on the evening news. Jim accepts the quarter-million in cash from Roberta and promptly loses it trying to make a big score. The Gambler based on James Tobacks 1974 script (which was purportedly autobiographical with a little Dostoevsky thrown in for good measure) is strong in almost every aspect except defining and developing character relationships. The William Monahan screenplay struggles to solidify the connections between Jim and Amy and Jim and Lamar. Its almost as if the movie is missing whole scenes that would round out the interaction between these individuals. Even the Jim/Roberta relationship could have used some bolstering. Theres a lot of tension between these two and we understand where at least some of it comes from but another scene or two with the criminally underused Jessica Lange wouldnt have hurt things. Theres a sense of unpredictability about the way in which The Gambler evolves. Jim isnt a nice guy; in a morally fair cinematic universe he would be destined for a bad end. Theres a streak of self-destruction in his actions; one character remarks that he seems to like losing. He possesses sufficient self-awareness to issue a warning to Amy to stay away from him but when faced with a no-win situation he takes the ethical low road because it offers his only chance of survival. Although Wahlbergs lead performance is solid (if unremarkable) there are several effective supporting stints. Brie Larson who has had a quiet 2014 following an active 2013 is good enough as Amy that we wish she had been given more screen time. Lange is heartbreaking as the cold rich widow who blames herself on some level for her sons failure. But towering them above them all is John Goodman as Frank a wisecracking loan shark. Goodmans nearly perfect portrayal of the philosophical larger-than-life gangster is worthy of Oscar notice although its unlikely hell get much consideration. Those who love the original The Gambler shouldnt feel threatened by Rupert Wyatts take on the material. Unlike many remakes this one isnt merely determined to regurgitate a cosmetically altered version of the story for a new audience; Wyatt and Monahan show respect for the source without being enslaved by it and the resulting story is worth seeing on its own merits.

This remake of the 1974 film starring James Caan and written as quasi-autobiography by James Toback bears little resemblance to the original and wisely so. Forty years on any attempt to emulate gritty 70s urban realism would come off as dated if not downright camp. But high style artful mood-setting and strong acting all around are offset by what ultimately becomes more like a stream of music-video excerpts than a cohesive story. Wahlberg plays world-weary wisecracking teacher and high-stakes blackjack addict Jim Bennett whose wealthy grandfather (hey there 89-year-old George Kennedy nice to briefly see you) announces on his deathbed that hes leaving zippo to his grandson. Jims double life is witnessed by one of his students casino waitress Amy (Brie Larson). After he turns on the charm in class she quite improbably falls for him and serves as adorable sidekick/lover for the duration. Jim whom one observant casino denizen dubs ""the kind of guy who likes to lose"" keeps trading on the momentary psychological highs of big wins to dig himself into the deep dirt by borrowing hundreds of thousands from a United Colors of Benetton array of baddies. These include a Korean casino owner; a loan shark and black-posse leader Neville (the effortlessly entertaining Michael Kenneth Williams making us pine for Omar from ""The Wire"") and Frank (John Goodman) a money-lending gangster who looks like a cross between Daddy Warbucks and Freddy Krueger spitting out curse-laden one-liners like a talking machine gun. Claire Folger  Paramount Pictures Blackjack fanatic Mark Wahlberg left and Brie Larson up their antes in a shinier remake of ""The Gambler."" Both Wahlberg and director Rupert Wyatt heretofore known primarily for ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" sit back and let Goodman play temporary chief gorilla for his too-few minutes on screen. We also see too little of Jessica Lange a spot-on glam grande dame as Jims heiress mother. The action grows increasingly fragmented dissipating the suspense over Jims final gamble on his own life. The ending goes disappointingly Hollywood complete with a groaner of a triumphant ""Rocky""-style running scene. But a string of powerful performances particularly Wahlbergs and a killer soundtrack -- including M83 Dinah Washington and St. Paul amp; the Broken Bones -- redeem a middling entertainment gambit.

"The Gambler (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Gambler (R) Wahlberg plays for keeps as a man on a self-destructive downward spiral. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezmiamiherald.com12/23/2014 Editor rating 3 Jim Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) the self-destructive protagonist of The Gambler is a published author and college professor who makes six figures a year. He comes from a wealthy family. Hes healthy and hes still young enough to have a career as a writer. But theres a nagging unhappiness that prevents him from enjoying life. ""Ive been sitting in a pool of infinite possibilities and Im sick of it"" he says. So he gets hooked on gambling borrowing from one loan shark to pay off another. But after he hits a particularly bad streak he ends up 260000 in debt with seven days to pay up. And the people he owes money to (including John Goodman The Wires Michael Kenneth Williams and Alvin Ing) are businessmen who dont believe in extensions or late payments. When the week is up Jim will have to pay them one way or another. Directed by Rupert Wyatt (Rise of the Planet of the Apes) and written by William Monahan (The Departed Kingdom of Heaven) The Gambler borrows its structure from James Tobacks 1974 cult classic which starred James Caan as a man similarly consumed by his vice (for Toback who has admitted he had a severe gambling problem the movie was a work of cathartic self-autobiography). But the new version uses addiction as a vehicle to tackle larger themes eloquently explored by Monahans dialogue which sings in a way uncommon to tough-guy crime-dramas. The Gambler is about the torturous dissatisfaction some people feel when theyve managed to do everything right but still dont feel fulfilled. The movie has the same fatalistic tone as the original but Wahlberg plays the character as an angrier more volatile man figuratively pounding his head against the wall to figure out whats eating him. His rich mother (an icy Jessica Lange) feels little sympathy for him. His students (including Brie Larson as an unusually bright student) dont understand when he tells them the protagonist of Albert Camus The Stranger was saving the last bullet for himself. ""Youre the kind of guy who likes to lose"" someone tells Jim referring not just to the blackjack table but also life itself. Yet suicide is not an option since hes the only male heir in his family. ""You jump off a bridge"" Goodmans scary gangster growls at him ""you do it with the knowledge youre killing your entire bloodline."" Shuffling through the movie in rumpled clothes and increasingly bruised face Wahlberg is enlivened by the opportunity to play a furious man who seems intent on throwing everything away Hes alive here in a way he rarely is in other pictures. He and the rest of the cast make their way through a seedy dark Los Angeles rarely seen in films and theres a palpable aura of menace that grows as Jims situation becomes more dire. Some people wont understand Jim at all but anyone who has succumbed to depression will sympathize with this doomed mans existential angst. The movie stumbles only in its closing scenes coming up with an ending thats too pat and obvious but the rest of The Gambler is surprisingly effective at letting you know what it feels like when youre dangling from the edge of the rope every minute of every day and youre too tired -- or unwilling -- to pull yourself back up.

Photo Claire Folger (c) 2014 Paramount Pictures MOVIE REVIEW The Gambler Running time 111 minutes. Rated R (profanity violence sexual situations). At the Kips Bay the Union Square others. I wish Id been present at the meeting where someone suggested Mark Wahlberg as a college literature professor steeped in Camus and Shakespeare. Can we also look forward to Michael Cera starring in ""The John Wayne Story""? Rosie ODonnell as Mother Teresa? How about Ben Affleck as Batman? But no. Now Im just being absurd. Wahlberg disgorging great knowing chunks of campus dialogue (you can tell hes reaching when his voice gets all high and defensive) redefines the phrase ""spectacular miscasting"" but this remake of the 1974 James Caan film written by James Toback still crackles with mordant cynicism. Professor Wahlberg spends his days telling his writing students theyre all useless except the one (Brie Larson) upon whom the gods of talent have smiled. At night he hits underground casinos where his strategy at the blackjack table is to keep betting until cleaned out then approach local loan sharks for more financing and repeat. As I asked when watching Christopher Walken make a career out of playing Russian roulette in ""The Deer Hunter"" How did this guy manage to stay alive this long? Dispensing with the niceties the action is boiled down to a single week which will be the last of the profs life unless he delivers a quarter of a million dollars to the two dangerous dudes he owes. Mark Wahlberg (left) is Jim Bennett and John Goodman is Frank in ""The Gambler.""Photo Claire Folger (c) 2014 Paramount Pictures The self-destructing nihilist movie is a favorite subgenre of mine but the presence of Larson -- a floral breeze unexpectedly wafting through one mans inferno -- creates a redemption possibility that means we dont know exactly what kind of movie were watching until the end. While structurally uninteresting the film is not then quite predictable. And thanks to the angular choices of director Rupert Wyatt (""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"") who fills the soundtrack with mind-messing stuff like reggae covers of Pink Floyd and a chorus singing Radioheads ""Creep"" the film feels like a strangely intoxicating dance to the gallows. Wahlbergs Jim Bennett it seems simply wants to get killed preferably with a lot of pain. He asks his rich mother (Jessica Lange) for the money but doesnt press. He refuses money from another loan shark (John Goodman) because he cant abide by one condition that he proclaim ""I am not a man."" Goodman clad in a towel and encased in a quantity of flesh that would make Jabba the Hutt blanch lays out the mechanics of the manly need for independence in what will soon be known -- must be known -- as the ""F - - You"" speech. Dialogue we seem to have forgotten matters and the words -- by the brutally funny screenwriter of ""The Departed"" William Monahan -- are electric eels slithering and sinister and nasty. They sneak up and sting you or sometimes tickle your toes. Lowlifes dont actually talk this way? Yeah. But if only they did.

His rising debt forces him to borrow money from his mother and a loan shark. VPCEXCLUSIVE FOR FIRST USE WITH USA TODAY SNEAK PEEK ON 10/08/14 0R 10/09/14. MUST APPEAR IN PRINT FOR ONLINE USE Mark Wahlberg as Jim Bennett and Brie Larson as Amy in a scene from the motion picture ""The Gambler."" CREDIT Claire Folger Paramount Pictures [Via MerlinFTP Drop](Photo Claire Folger Paramount Pictures)The Gambler is a hollow overwrought and glibly cynical remake of a 70s drama about a self-destructive academic.Mark Wahlberg stars as Jim Bennett a college English professor with a penchant for high-stakes blackjack games. Bennett is so self-absorbed unethical and unlikable that its hard to care what happens to him as he dodges (and takes beatings from) men to whom he owes hundreds of thousands of dollars. He hardly seems to care so audiences shouldnt either ( 1/2 out four; rated R; opens Thursday nationwide).After his grandfathers funeral Bennett heads for an illegal casino overlooking the Pacific where he borrows 50000 from Neville Baraka (Michael Kenneth Williams) a gangster he initially insults. He blows it on blackjack and roulette and gets further entangled by pitting Baraka against the guy who runs the casino (Alvin Ing). All told he owes 240000.The grandson of one of the richest men in California Bennett begs his wealthy mother (Jessica Lange) for money then treats her hideously after she ponies up. Rather than paying his debts he blows what she gives him on more gambling. Before he began this destructive pattern  Bennett wrote a well-reviewed novel. But that was then. Now the muse has been replaced by the devil on his shoulder. Perhaps because he comes from money he can afford a reputation as ""the kind of guy who likes to lose."" Just to make himself a notch more abhorrent Bennett embarks on an affair with Amy (Brie Larson) one of his students. He wins her over by announcing in class that shes the only talented student in the room. But the movie doesnt bother to show Amys smarts. The talented Larson is given little to do other than react. This is a macho movie after all Women fall into two categories -- nubile specimens made for bedding or nagging harridans.Bennetts the kind of teacher who exists only in movies -- lying on his desk and blathering pompously berating his students about the perils of mediocrity. The film was inspired by the 1974 James Caan drama of the same name. Caans Harvard-educated professor borrows cash from a girlfriend his mother and bad guys to finance his gambling addiction. Here Bennett comes off as bored and contemptuous more than addicted. Wahlberg is miscast unconvincing as a depressed intellectual or a compulsive gambler. Determined to rely on luck and wits Bennett involves a struggling student Lamar (Anthony Kelley) in a gambling scheme risking the young mans basketball career. Its hard not to wish the college authorities would get wind of his unethical behavior and ruin his life.John Goodman plays the only entertaining character a bald avuncular loan shark.Larsons Amy astutely points out ""Youre one of those guys who started out with no problems at all and now you have all of them.""Bennett tossed his good fortune away and spends an inordinate amount of time soaking in a bathtub in a none-too-subtle attempt to wash away his sins. The redemptive ending feels contrived. A bleak finale would at least have been consistent. Think of this as the anti-holiday movie. For those who would rather not be entertained inspired or intrigued and who prefer emptiness over substance theres The Gambler. 29 CONNECTTWEET 2 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/16OkBz9",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/12/23/the-gambler-review/19156935/,200,thegambler17,thegambler,usatoday

Photo Credit AP / Claire Folger advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A college professor with a gambling problem gets in over his head. Rated R. BOTTOM LINE Low on action and tension long on grand speeches. Wahlberg gets an A for effort in an unlikely role. CAST Mark Wahlberg Brie Larson John Goodman LENGTH 151 Mark Wahlberg as a literature professor? Talk about a long shot. ""The Gambler"" casts the South Boston former hoodlum as Jim Bennett a promising novelist who has settled for teaching Shakespeare at a Los Angeles college. Jim however is also a gambling addict with ties to the underworld so Wahlberg gets to split his role the academic which is a stretch and the roughneck a much safer bet. In the end the actor breaks even. Wahlbergs Jim has charm talent and a serious self-destructive streak. He places insane bets with money borrowed from various bone breakers. He risks injury by mouthing off to his creditors; risks his job by dating a student Amy (Brie Larson); risks the love of his mother (a terrific Jessica Lange) by frittering away her fortune. ""I want unlimited things"" Jim says. ""And I want to die if I dont get it."" As his debt level soars Jim just might get his wish. advertisement | advertise on newsday Wahlberg replaces another rough-edged actor James Caan in this remake of the 1974 film written by James Toback (a former teacher and gambling addict). Like Caan Wahlberg can be electrifying in the casino less so in the classroom. Both actors have pent-up energy and a so-shoot-me insouciance but they cant convincingly hold forth on the great novelists. In both films our hero feels like a contrivance. Directed by Rupert Wyatt with flashy but superficial style ""The Gambler"" overall rings false. Michael Kenneth Williams and John Goodman deliver fine comic performances as oddly cultured loan sharks but instead of raising the stakes these characters mostly just lecture Jim on his faults. Screenwriter William Monahan (""The Departed"") puts amusingly eclectic references in their mouths -- from John Lennon to King George III -- but the effect is to turn Jims ostensible plight into a big harmless game. ""The Gambler"" is too much in love with the sound of its own voice and too proud of its pop-rock soundtrack (Billy Bragg Pulp Alan Price) to tell a compelling story. Wahlberg deserves credit for doubling down on an unlikely role but ""The Gambler"" is a bust. 233 MoviesThe Gambler trailer Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Monday Dec. 22 2014 342PM EST Last updated Monday Dec. 22 2014 344PM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Rupert Wyatt Written by William Monahan Starring Mark Wahlberg John Goodman Country USA Language English Slick but slight The Gambler is an unnecessary remake of a well-regarded 1974 film written by James Toback and starring James Caan about an academic with a huge gambling problem who piles up debts with a trio of loan sharks. Full of post-hippie fatalism and cynical macho barroom existentialism the original film feels very much of its era and the remake anachronistic. Video Video How losing 60 pounds turned Mark Wahlberg into The Gambler At the New York premiere of his new drama The Gambler Mark Wahlberg talks about the rumors and the real reasons for him wanting a pardon for an assault charge he received when he was a teen. (Dec. 11) AP Video Video Video Why Mark Wahlberg wants a pardon for his criminal past Mark Wahlberg stars as Jim Bennett an English professor and novelist (okay sure) who denounces his students for their failure to understand that geniuses like Shakespeare or Camus count. (""If youre not a genius dont bother."") And with the exception of pretty Amy (Brie Larson) theyre time-wasting mediocrities which is probably not going to help his ""rate my professor"" card.After accruing debts of almost a quarter-million dollars to a Korean casino another 50 grand to a loan shark (Michael Kenneth Williams) he squanders a bailout from his socialite mom (Jessica Lange). As a last resort he approaches the monstrous but insightful underworld kingpin Frank (a very good and very bald John Goodman) who correctly reads Bennetts addiction as a death wish.Rupert Wyatt who directed 2011s Rise of the Planet of the Apes keeps the pace peppery with surprising musical choices from Dinah Washington to Chopin to Bob Dylan but despite his swagger theres little point of identification with Bennetts privileged self-destructive character unless you share his penchant for dangerous but dull games.

More about The Gambler >> A disappointing thriller from Rise of the Planet of the Apes director Rupert Wyatt The Gambler is a remake of the 1974 James Caan gem of the same name which itself was loosely based on a 1867 novella by Fyodor Dostoyevsky one of the grandpapas of existentialism. The original story is about a despairing fatalistic antihero whod rather sink into an abyss of chance events than take his fate in his own hands. Refracted through so many Hollywood-cut lenses its heart barely survives in the latest film. Caan was mesmerizing as the gambling antihero in the original film a picture rich with atmosphere and tension. The remake isnt quite as dazzling. Wahlberg making his first real attempt to assay Drama with a capital D turns in a too-restrained strangely emotionless performance. He acquits himself well although he simply cant match Caans intensity. Wahlberg stars as Jim Bennett a failed novelist who works as a literature professor by day and an inveterate - one is tempted to say degenerate - gambler by night. A child of privilege he was given the best of everything by his mother Roberta (Jessica Lange in a stirring memorable turn). He published his first novel to great acclaim. Six years later hes all washed up as a writer. His consolation is the classroom where he performs with great aplomb. Hes one of those cool-dude profs who bound across the classroom reciting Camus and Shakespeare. He considers most of his young charges mediocre materialistic fools and hes happy to tell them so to their faces. But he does nurture a couple of gifted undergrads including Amy (an underutilized Brie Larson) a sensitive soul thirsty for knowledge and hungry for Jims approval and love. As the story opens Jim is told by his dying grandfather that he wont get a cent of his fortune. Jim has to make it on his own. And it seems hed rather do anything but try. In a rapidly moving dynamic 10-minute sequence he wins big at blackjack then doubles down and loses everything; borrows money from a loan shark (The Wires Michael Kenneth Williams) wins a packet of money then blows it on one play. Just to make his life more miserable he borrows more money from another loan shark (John Goodman). ""Lifes a losing proposition. Might as well get it over with"" Jim says with some relish. Despite terrific witty performances by Williams and Goodman most of the talent is wasted in this picture. And its contrived ending a departure from the first film is just plain silly. tirdadphillynews.com 215-854-2736 Published December 23 2014 -- 300 PM EST | Updated December 24 2014 -- 738 PM EST The Philadelphia Inquirer Continue Reading More in entertainment Steven Rea > Philly director from NoLibs making waves in Hollywood Television > HBO confirms end to Game of Thrones but spinoffs still possible Celebrities amp; Gossip > Clintons party at Kimmel Center post-acceptance speech Austin folkie Sarah Jarosz goes to the head of her class with album tour Folk music is a rich fine palate for Sarah Jarosz the classically trained but rustic singer/songwriter coming to Ardmore Music Hall Sunday...

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Starring Mark Wahlberg and directed by Rupert Wyatt ""The Gambler"" is a remake of the 1974 film written by James Toback. The film will be released in the U.S. on Dec. 19. (Paramount Pictures) By Stephanie Merry December 23 2014 Follow stephmerry Actor Mark Wahlberg and director Rupert Wyatt reportedly wanted James Caan to make a cameo in ""The Gambler"" their remake of the 1974 crime drama. Caan who starred in the original told the New York Times his reaction was ""What a horrible idea a ridiculous distraction. Me I thought Why even remind them? Then I think both came to their senses."" Well not entirely. Wyatt and Wahlberg may have thought better of that one bad idea but there are plenty of others on display in this sleek but trivial account of a privileged jerk hellbent on self-destruction. Wahlberg plays the title character Jim Bennett a generally unsavory guy in Los Angeles who grew up rich. Jim is the type who would be rude to a waitress just because. Hes certainly surly with the card dealers he encounters and he encounters a lot. Thats because Jim is addicted to gambling or arguably addicted to losing. He has done so much of both that hes in the hole for 240000 to two dangerous men Neville Baraka (Michael K. Williams) and Mr. Lee (Alvin Ing). He has a week to pay up. If Jim has a single redeeming quality its that he is supposedly a genius. He has decrypted the prose of Albert Camus and written a novel landing him a gig at a local university teaching literature. Problem is Wahlberg is entirely unbelievable as a savant. During his long and dragging lecture scenes he dispenses his brilliant points with such rapid-fire emptiness that its unclear he even knows what hes saying. The dialogue written by Academy Award winner William Monahan (""The Departed"") may be great but who can tell? Wahlbergs delivery makes his lines unintelligible. This squandering is especially unfortunate given that Wahlbergs talky scenes in ""The Departed"" were some of the movies most memorable. A subplot involving Jims relationship with a student Amy (Brie Larson) is equally shallow. The camera lingers on Amys comely face in various scenes but she never says much. Perhaps her one- dimensional nature helps explain why she would fall for a man who drags her to a casino and proceeds to ignore her for hours. (But nothing can explain why while working on a novel shes wearing a silk robe falling off one shoulder. Thats just impractical.) 1 of 14 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad x Seasons screenings View Photos Check out our holiday movie superlatives full of postulations about what youre likely to get with the buzziest releases. Caption Check out our holiday movie superlatives. Most likely to make you want to learn the lyrics so you can sing along next time ""Into the Woods"" Stephen Sondheim and James Lapines Broadway musical is a complicated and rather dark affair in which the heroes of various fairy tales cross paths in a forest. You can bet this new adaptation courtesy of Disney will be both simplified and slightly more family-friendly. Regardless of how you feel about the changes great music remains -- the stage show won the Tony for best original score and best book after all -- and theres a standout cast that includes Meryl Streep (pictured) Anna Kendrick Johnny Depp and Emily Blunt. (Dec. 25. PG.) Peter Mountain/Disney Enterprises Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Wyatt and Wahlberg fare better in the look-and-feel department. Wahlberg is always reliable as the cool guy; he even pulls off wearing sunglasses inside. And the soundtrack is full of gems -- 1970s tracks and covers of such songs as ""Dont Think Twice Its All Right"" and ""Money."" But its John Goodman who steals every scene. As a scary loan shark who might cough up cash to get Jim out of his pickle Goodman elevates the material showcasing the dark humor that Wyatt was clearly going for. But overall that comedy just doesnt land. Watching a hostile pessimist purposefully sabotaging his own good fortune just isnt as fun as it sounds.  1/2 R. At area theaters.

All Rights Reserved. In Rupert Wyatts highball-cool reworking of Karel Reiszs 1974 The Gambler Mark Wahlberg does not play a cop does not shoot bad guys with a gun and does not spend considerable time shirtless (though we do see him sulking in a bathtub and theres a fleeting wet T-shirt moment too). Unable to fall back on any of his trademarks Wahlberg playing a disillusioned literature professor who springs to life only at the gaming table must work mostly with his eyes. Player wins. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The Gambler is a polished entertainment about a raggedy subject Its not meant as a gritty study of the tragedy compulsive gambling can wreak on human lives but as a fantasy about an obsessive risk-taker who kicks the habit by kicking the stakes sky-high -- and by falling in love with a woman who wants him to be the best version of himself he can possibly be whatever that is. In other words the pleasures offered by The Gambler are simple but dont hold that against it. Wyatt director of the 2011 surprise hit Rise of the Planet of the Apes brings some bristly swaggering energy to the thing and that in turn may have loosened Wahlberg up Hes both more intense and freer than hes been in years.Wahlbergs Jim Bennett is a trust fund kid whos reached the limits of parental trust. He lives in a covet-worthy glassy house somewhere around Los Angeles. We know that he cant possibly afford it on the salary he earns as a teacher at a not-particularly-prestigious-looking college. His gambling winnings dont sustain him either -- in fact hes in debt well past his ears and the somewhat benevolent owner of his favorite establishment Mr. Lee (Alvin Ing) has at last run out of patience with him. To pay off that debt Jim turns to a number of increasingly ruthless loan sharks beginning with cartoon soul-brother Neville Baraka (the cagey-wonderful Michael Kenneth Williams) and big-and-scary white dude Frank (John Goodman who makes his entrance half-naked in a sauna -- his golden moment arrives when he unceremoniously tops off his shaved pate with a misshapen terrycloth beanie that resembles a toddlers sunhat).Film Details The Gambler RatingR GenreDrama Running Time101 min. More Info Trailer As it turns out Jim also has a very rich and very foreboding mom in the form of Jessica Lange She shows up fabulously foxtails swinging a giant alligator Birkin dangling from the crook of her arm. Shes none too happy about handing over a fat sackful of dough to her wayward son but out of a twisted kind of motherly love she complies. Dont even ask what Jim does with the money. Meanwhile he also finds himself attracted to his brightest student Amy played by the breezily charming Brie Larson. Boy that girl can write We know this because Jim tells us so in a rambling but hugely entertaining lecture delivered to his class. As the author of a well-reviewed novel that nonetheless failed to set the world on fire he makes sourpuss references to his own lack of talent. ""If youre not a genius"" he tells his increasingly slack-jawed students ""dont bother.""Rupert and cinematographer Greig Fraser delight in slick shiny surfaces roughened up just slightly so they dont look too clean or polished. When Jim gets behind the wheel of his car -- one thats way too nice for the likes of him and you can bet he doesnt hang on to it for long -- the lights of the tunnel hes driving through reflect oh-so-stylishly off the windshield. When he sits down at the gaming tables of Mr. Lees posh gambling den the cushiness around him harbors just a trace of the seedy a visual reminder that even though gambling feels oh-so-right to Jim its really oh-so-wrong. The dialogue also swings wild and free The script is by William Monahan most famous for having written The Departed though he also directed the wily and underappreciated 2010 crime drama London Boulevard. Monahans screenplay channels the 70s bad-boy spirit of James Toback who wrote the script for the original ""Genius is magical not material"" Jim tells his students turning the line into an advertising slogan against the dangers of overconfidence. In its faux humility its damn cocky.You cant really like Jim but you cant help feeling something for him either. The focus is always on his eyes whether theyre fixed on the chips stacked before him or the dealer glowering warily back at him. For an actor whos made a career especially of late off excessive muscular swagger Wahlberg can do a lot with a glance -- you know theres a wounded puppy behind Jims wildcat glare. And if that sounds like a stock acting-workshop character trait that too is part of the fun of The Gambler. Though it wears a classy veneer its still a genre picture at heart. When you finally walk away from the table you feel youve lost nothing.Directed by Rupert Wyatt. Written by William Monahan.

(Photo credit Claire Folger/Claire Folger) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Monday December 22 2014 200 AM Title The Gambler Film Info With Mark Wahlberg Jessica Lange A professor tries to dig himself out of debt. Director Rupert Wyatt (137). R Language sexuality violence. Area theaters. Opens Wednesday night. Understatement is one of Mark Wahlbergs greatest assets. But that admirable trait winds up working against him in ""The Gambler"" Rupert Wyatts otherwise intriguing dramatic thriller. Whether Wahlbergs been miscast or misdirected we never buy him as a desperate addict. Still the movie is so quick and cool that for much of the time we barely notice how little is actually at stake. Wahlbergs Jim Bennett is a brilliant English professor by day obsessive gambler by night. He doesnt seem to care whether he wins or loses. He just needs to play. Soon hes borrowing from one mobster to pay another and another. His rich mother Roberta (Jessica Lange) is disgusted and his star students (a memorable Anthony Kelley a wasted Brie Larson) are losing respect for him daily. William Monahans screenplay is based on a 1974 Karel-Reisz-directed gem written by James Toback. While the original is a gritty character study this version plays more as a slick ode to atmosphere. In that regard it works beautifully. The cold remove of Robertas mansion the smoky seduction of underground gambling dens the charged communal laughter of his college lecture hall ... all hit hard. Swinging from Dinah Washington to Ray LaMontagne the soundtrack is wryly moody. Some of the supporting performances are equally evocative. John Goodman and Michael Kenneth Williams are so funny and scary as loan sharks that each of their characters could carry a movie of his own. Jim on the other hand really cant. Wahlberg does well as the rational professor but never gets to the irrational heart of the addict. Even at his most self-destructive Jim remains poker-faced. As a result we dont know whether to root for or against him. We dont even know who he is. The truth is this is a role that cries out for the unrestrained id of say Robert Downey Jr. Or for that matter for the arrogant nerve of James Caan who provided the twitchy heart of Reiszs original. Its on Netflix now. Watch it and feel the thrill of an actor prepared to up the ante.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet ""Im not a gambler"" insists Jim Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) the title character of The Gambler though both his actions and the name of the film chronicling them beg to differ. English professor by day wannabe high roller by night and shiftless washed-up novelist by both Jim makes his first appearance at a shady Los Angeles gambling den. Here in the films opening scene he wins big at the blackjack table doubles down and loses it all wins again on money staked to him by a loan shark and then blows all of that on another foolish bet--all within 10 minutes of running time and without a second of hesitation. None of that looks like the type of behavior one might expect from a man who doesnt have a problem. Yet as Jim gets deeper and deeper into trouble and the details of his charmed life shift into focus an alternate explanation for such reckless wagering presents itself. Maybe Jim isnt a gambler. Maybe hes just a rich asshole with a death wish.The Gambler draws both its name and its basic plot structure from a 1974 James Toback movie which itself was a loose adaptation of a Dostoyevsky novel. Both of those works were very plainly about addiction presenting antiheroes whose compulsive betting was a reflection of their authors shared vice. By contrast this remake slickly directed by Rupert Wyatt (Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes) and loudly written by William Monahan (The Departed) has refashioned the same story into a swaggering California crime comedy about a golden boy rebelling against his own privilege mostly by flushing every dollar he can get his hands on down the toilet. Blackjack is more of a noose than a needle for this self-destructive blowhard and if that sounds less dramatic than the tale of a man who just cant walk away from the table it is significantly funnier.Wahlberg excels at braggadocio and that thankfully is Monahans specialty Early scenes of Jim pacing around his classroom berating his students for their lack of natural talent play like little more than blatant showcases for the screenwriters colorful shit talk. Monahan structures The Gambler as a series of punchy conversations counting down the days until Jim has to shell out thousands of dollars to both the stoic kingpin Mister Lee (Alvin Ing) and impatient gangster Neville (Michael Kenneth Williams). As the deadline nears our hero pulls a couple of star athletes into his dilemma hits up his wealthy mother (Jessica Lange) and considers borrowing what he owes from Frank (John Goodman) a truly ruthless lender who warns him to find another way. Goodman delivers his spooky-amusing speeches with relish as though he were auditioning about a decade late for The Departed.A more serious movie would treat the looming threat of debt collection as a source of mounting suspense. But even as Jim blows every lifeline he receives The Gambler keeps its cool; its the most casual downward spiral in recent memory. Theres a lot of humor in the characters incorrigible nonchalance When Neville comes knocking for his money Jim absently suggests that he stake him more gambling capital and Williams conveys a disbelief so deep it almost looks like admiration. Less compelling is the quasi-romantic relationship between Jim and his sharpest pupil played by overqualified Short Term 12 star Brie Larson. While basically the inverse of a certain tiresome archetype--lets call her the stable brainy dream girl--the character still exists primarily to shove our male hero into a sea change.For all the pop and flavor of the tough-guy dialogue neither Monahan nor Wyatt seem especially interested in establishing an authentic atmosphere for their world of underground casinos and credit-line crooks. (One gets the impression that The Gambler is set in Los Angeles as opposed to Vegas or Atlantic City for chiefly financial reasons.) But maybe thats just because again this isnt really a gambling movie. It just uses the high stakes of blackjack and roulette to goose its not-exactly-relatable story of someone who has everything--money acclaim charisma good looks--but still feels like he has nothing to lose. In any case none of the gambles Jim makes over the course of the movie are as ballsy as the films casting strategy. Will audiences really buy Mark Wahlberg as a wordsmith too brilliant for academia? Smart money says no. Share Tweet Filed Under Film Mark Wahlberg Brie Larson Jessica Lange Michael K.

Almost anything would have to be. Miscast misguided and a missed opportunity on just about every level Rupert Wyatts overly slick underworld thriller about a literature professor with a spiraling-out-of-control betting addiction is one of the bigger disappointments of the holiday season. For a film about gambling its strangely averse to risk. The missteps start at the top. Mark Wahlberg can be raw and vulnerable in the right role but hes never believable as the self-destructive scholar Jim Bennett. It isnt just the laughably unconvincing way he interacts with his students in the classroom; it bleeds over into the moments that are supposed to give the film a dark after-hours punch. In one early scene Bennett shows up at an illegal high-roller casino up in the hills overlooking the Pacific. He walks up to a blackjack table and coolly blows through 80000 as if its nothing. Maybe it is maybe it isnt Wahlbergs face is such a blank you cant tell. In the earlier film as Caan was sinking deeper and deeper into an existential black hole he at least gave you a glimpse of the death-wish high he was chasing. You felt sick watching him lose. But Wahlberg is a cipher. After hes borrowed more money and squandered that too the walls start closing in on him. Hes on the hook to the sorts of people you dont want to owe money to like John Goodmans chrome-domed loan shark (one of the movies few highlights). Scrambling to raise cash Bennett hits up his disapproving wealthy mother (Jessica Lange who can do icy in her sleep) falls into bed with one of his students (Brie Larson in a thankless role) and dodges an endless volley of knuckle-dragging goons. Its all so formulaic and flat youd think that screenwriter William Monahan would at least stick to the originals boldly bleak non-Hollywood ending right? Guess again. The one bit of good news is that the first Gambler is currently streaming on Netflix. Do yourself a favor and watch that one instead.

A calm and collected literature professor Bennett already owes 240000 by the time he enters a sleek underground establishment in the opening scene -- fictional accounts of gamblings evils always make the world of high-stakes betting look so cool dont they? -- and quickly adds to that considerable sum by borrowing a further 50000 from a gangster named Neville (Michael Kenneth Williams) whose reputation for brutality precedes him. This sets the events in motion for a cooly entertaining countdown narrative (seven days to be precise) whose stakes rarely feel as life-and-death as theyre meant to. READ MORE Mark Wahlberg Gets His Ass Kicked in The Gambler Red Band Trailer Not that this is always to its detriment. Wyatt who helmed the unexpectedly solid ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" reboot directs with less reckless abandon than his protagonist but a similar lack of angst. For all the hundreds of thousands of dollars being thrown around ""The Gambler"" is much closer to a friendly game of poker with some loquacious quick-witted friends than a glimpse at the gambling worlds dark underbelly. Neither is it a preachy moral tale Bennett is so open about his many shortcomings that theres hardly a chance for us to judge him even if we were so inclined. Wahlberg looks as unkempt as possible his perpetual poker face both a defense mechanism and an accurate representation of his curiously laid-back demeanor. It goes without saying that the various loan sharks methods of recuperating their money are said to be sinister but for a while at least Bennett seems unfazed. He fancies himself a truth-teller and his unorthodox lecturing style includes digressions on the nature of excellence how its something innate that a few are born with and many others try fruitlessly to attain. ""If youre not a genius dont bother"" he tells his class at the end of a rant that began with a discussion of Shakespeare. Hes exactly the kind of charming conflicted antihero that Wahlberg has long excelled at playing and he settles into the role with typical ease. The literary allusion-heavy passages he and several others sprinkle into conversation are courtesy of ""The Departed"" scribe William Monahan whose work here is as smart and punchy as weve come to expect -- sometimes self-consciously so. (Your mileage may vary with Bennetts resigned utterly candid lecturing style; ditto the decision to include Pink Floyds ""Money"" on the soundtrack.) Bennetts blase attitude belies the seriousness of his situation he wants everything or nothing and is willing to self-destruct in pursuit of it all. Little inquiry is made into the nature of his affinity for games of chance beyond that and were sometimes made to wonder if this is the gambling version of suicide by cop -- to come across as so indifferent to the high-powered thugs breathing down his neck that theyll eventually just put him out of his misery. Even so Wyatt and Monahan are reluctant to truly raise the stakes until the third act at which point weve lost track of how much Bennett owes to how many parties (and he probably has too). Its hard to care that hes blown the 300000 his mother (Jessica Lange) gave him to bail him out during a single trip to a Palm Springs Casino for instance when hes so clearly unconcerned by the inevitable development himself. It isnt until Neville threatens his student/eventual love interest (Brie Larson) that he even attempts to get his act together at which point ""The Gambler"" execution finally begin to align with its ambitions. It may not exhibit much genius but at least it bothers trying. Grade B ""The Gambler"" premiered this week at AFI Fest. It opens in limited release on December 18 followed by a nationwide expansion on January 2.

Here Mark Wahlberg embraces self-loathing and personal free fall in a cool but perversely intriguing look at a man who not only walks on the wild side but seems to want to take up residence there. Not quite the full-on downer that the original was this Paramount release should score a decent take commercially. Fully four decades after producing the original Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff joined by other colleagues are back for a second try with a story that did not prove a hit at the time but remains one of Paramounts stellar titles of its great early 1970s period. James Toback whose screenplay for the original was his first is credited here as an executive producer along with current writer William Monahan who has moved the action from the goombah-dominated streets of New York to the more elegant Asian-run gambling salons of Southern California even as he has wisely retained the schizophrenic brainy-base personality split of the central character. Bluntly told by his wealthy dying grandfather (George Kennedy) in the opening scene that hell inherit nothing from him Jim Bennett (Wahlberg) quickly establishes himself as the reckless sort prone to risking everything. As he runs up winnings at a swank coastal gambling spa run by a Mr. Lee (Alvin Ing) Jim never sets anything aside doubling his earnings at blackjack until inevitably he loses everything which may be what he most deeply craves. In the blink of an eye Jim owes Mr. Lee 240000 and his situation gets worse when he is staked to 20000 by downtown loan shark Neville (Michael Kenneth Williams) to help him climb back and he blows through that too. Jim doesnt want to rely for help on his steely Beverly Hills mother (an excellent Jessica Lange) whose wealth may be a major reason why he imagines hell always be rescued from trouble but she refuses to help -- until that is she takes him to the bank and gives him everything he needs. The true depth of Jims recklessness only becomes clear in the wake of his angry mothers largesse but then the mans existence generally reflects a perplexing duality. This inveterate risk-seeker who is drawn to the low life holds down a day job as an associate professor of literature. With his students hes boldly confrontational mixing among them in the lecture hall while ostensibly teaching Shakespeare to provoke them in sometimes rudely personal ways. Three students all high achievers interest him Dexter (Emory Cohen) a top tennis player with an unassuming personality; Lamar (Anthony Kelley) a stellar basketball player who although only a junior is leaning toward turning pro now; and Amy (Brie Larson) whom Jim singles out as the only brilliant writer in the class. ""If youre not a genius dont bother"" Jim proclaims noting his own promising but unremarkable first novel published some years back. This challenge to Amy has the desired effect that Jim might have privately intended -- it piques her interest in him to the point that they head off together on a desert excursion that ends up unfortunately in some Indian casinos where Jims worst instincts once again assume the upper hand sending him to a new low of jeopardy. The expansion of the female lead from the mere tag-along played with offbeat charm by Lauren Hutton in the original to a student who blithely announces her intention to ignite an ""inappropriate relationship"" with her teacher is one of the few upgrades registered in Monahans script. The screenplay is otherwise notable for a couple of brashly colorful monologues written for the grandiloquently philosophical underworld figure played with worldly-wise articulation by John Goodman. As the days count down the gambler is forced to do something he would not otherwise consider which is to lean on the vulnerable Lamar to alter the outcome of a basketball game. Even then its not over yet and Monahan and director Rupert Wyatt have contrived a resolution that is rather more audience-friendly than the bloodily bleak one director Karel Reisz served up in the original. In nearly every scene Wahlberg carries off the central role with what could be called determined elan. Bluntly sometimes viciously frank Jim spares no one in his circle beginning with himself and his uncensored talk with his chosen students stands in sharp contrast with his limited ability to communicate clearly with his grandfather and mother. His gambling compulsion goes beyond addiction into something congenital; the causes behind it are not precisely spelled out but clearly have to do with severe family issues and emotional warp. All the same Jim remains to some extent an unreachable character someone you pity or shake your head over rather than empathize with. The supporting roles are well etched from Goodmans turn as a Buddha of the underworld and Langes sharp portrait of an outwardly tough mother to smart work from Larson as a bright and bold student Kelley as the talented but questioning hoops star and Williams as a multifaceted and eloquent crime figure. Craft contributions are strong although the music and songs interspersed between scenes feel too lightweight and ephemeral in light of the matter at hand.

Theres enough swaggering cynicism for three pictures but barely enough soul to sustain even one in Rupert Wyatts ""The Gambler"" a stylish energetic but disappointingly glib remake of Karel Reiszs still-potent 1974 drama of the same title. Mark Wahlberg tears into one of his meatiest roles as an English professor drowning in a sea of blackjack debts and self-destructive impulses a born risk-taker whos aptly described as everything from ""the kind of guy that likes to lose"" to ""the worlds stupidest asshole."" But its that surfeit of macho attitude in William Monahans script that keeps Wahlberg from coming anywhere near James Caans sly brilliance in the earlier film making this a movie of slick surface-level pleasures thats unpersuasive at its core. In a roll of the awards-season dice Paramount is launching ""The Gambler"" Dec. 19 with a one-week Oscar-qualifying run before its Jan. 2 wide release when the collective draw of Wahlberg and a juicy supporting cast should yield solid if not hefty B.O. payouts. Released just a month after ""California Split"" Robert Altmans more idiosyncratic take on the pleasures and perils of going all in Reiszs original ""Gambler"" marked the heavily autobiographical screenwriting debut of James Toback who initially objected when Paramount announced plans for a remake without his knowledge. (The scribe has since given the project his blessing and received an exec producer credit while original producers Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff retain those credits here.) In its broad narrative outlines if not its jazzier sense of style the remake remains largely faithful to Tobacks self-probing study of a Harvard-educated New York academic who finds himself increasingly at the mercy of his gambling addiction alienating his nearest and dearest while seeking to evade and outwit all the bookies and collectors on his tail. In this Los Angeles-set retelling Wahlberg plays Jim Bennett a cynical motormouth who spends most of his evenings at the blackjack tables and roulette wheels of a Korean-run establishment where hes racked up enough debt that the casinos tolerant owner Mr. Lee (Alvin Ing) can no longer turn a blind eye. Learning that he has one week to pay back 240000 or face grievous consequences Bennett makes his situation immediately worse by accepting 50000 from a beret-wearing loan shark named Neville Baraka (Michael Kenneth Williams) establishing a pattern of borrowing from Peter to pay Paul and squandering every bailout that comes his way. On more than one occasion Bennett approaches big-time lender Frank (a superb bald-pated John Goodman) who warns him not to make the mistake of appropriating his services lest he find himself forced to pay the ultimate price. Bennetts compulsion springs at least partly from his privileged upbringing and he reacts with more contempt than gratitude when his acerbic mother Roberta (Jessica Lange) coughs up the requisite quarter-million in cash though she warns him that its the last time shell come to his rescue. But a solution that easy would scarcely satisfy the storys dramatic requirements much less Bennett himself who seems hooked on more than just the possibility of winning big. What excites him is the far more dangerous thrill of pushing himself to the limits and potentially losing everything so that he can rely on his wits and sheer dumb luck to pull himself back from the brink. When a concerned croupier balks at dealing him another hand telling him its for his own good Bennett fires back ""You dont come here for the fucking protection."" By day Bennett (sort of) teaches a college class on the modern novel which mainly consists of bashing the know-nothings and burnouts who call themselves his students using Shakespeare and Camus to pound home the idea that only a few lucky geniuses are able to rise above mediocrity in their chosen field. One such exception is Amy Phillips (Brie Larson) a quietly brilliant literature student and part-time casino employee who knows about her professors double life (shades of ""Half Nelson"") which naturally leads them to the next level of inappropriate intimacy. But Amy isnt the only pupil who will figure into Bennetts escape plan The others are Dexter (Emory Cohen) a state tennis champ and Lamar (Anthony Kelley) a GPA-challenged basketball star who might be just what Bennett needs to dig himself out of his latest hole. Virtually without exception the dialogue in ""The Gambler"" is pitched at a level of caustic hyper-articulate testosterone-fueled bluster that swiftly announces itself as Monahans handiwork. In that respect the script proves a sturdy fit for Wahlberg who may be no viewers idea of a professorial type but who knows how to toss off Monahans profane zingers with aplomb as he did in his Oscar-nominated performance in ""The Departed."" Here playing a guy so bored with his coddled complacent existence that he can only feel alive by risking everything Wahlberg proves no less ferociously eloquent -- too eloquent frankly to the point where you wish that Bennett would spend less time sounding off about what an empty shell hes become and more time simply being. There are a few attempts to underline the notion that this guy is sinking in own excesses particularly in the surreal use of water imagery; in one dreamlike interlude a bathtub (a nod to a scene in the 1974 film) briefly opens a window into his childlike soul. But in the end ""The Gambler"" doesnt seem especially interested in exploring these tortured depths. Even as a clock counts down the days to his deadline (a device that generates little in the way of suspense) Bennett doesnt really deepen in complexity or pathos; he just gets snarkier and more self-satisfied. Given his near-total disregard for his own safety it almost feels like a waste of energy for a viewer to root for him to survive or to take much pleasure in the films softly redemptive ending; by the time Bennett finally takes a well-deserved punch from one of Mr. Lees thugs you may feel less inclined to flinch than to cheer. Neither of the two actresses is well served by the scripts awfully stunted view of women though Lange succeeds in upping the emotional ante in her few scenes as the embittered mother reacting to her sons dilemma with equal parts scorn and horror. Larson so good in last years ""Short Term 12"" is a wonderfully poised presence here but its one of the films more glaring failures that it gives us no real sense of Amys intellectual potential; the moment she falls into bed with Bennett is the moment she ceases to be a figure of interest. Williams Ing and especially Goodman deliver uniquely pungent variations on the role of the reluctant enforcer waxing philosophical about their methods and never resorting to physical violence unless absolutely necessary while Richard Schiff has an amusing scene as a pawnbroker whom our hero approaches in his hour of need. Wyatt the accomplished helmer behind 2011s terrific ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" and the under-appreciated 2008 prison drama ""The Escapist"" keeps the energy percolating at a high level throughout -- mainly through a stream of arresting and unpredictable musical choices that include Chopin Cole Porter and Bob Dylan encompassing everything from Dinah Washingtons soulful ""This Bitter Earth"" to Scala amp; Kolacny Brothers haunting a cappella cover of ""Creep."" (Wyatt shares the music-supervisor credits with Theo Green and Clint Bennett.) Pete Beaudreaus editing is sharpest in the casino where the rapid-fire blackjack games naturally heighten ones attention; a time-lapse gambling sequence and a few tilt-shift effects further distinguish d.p. Greig Frasers often dark and moody visuals which make atmospheric use of recognizable L.A. landmarks (including USC and Downtown) as well as other California locations.

But while James Caan in the 1974 version offered a kind of existentialist bravado Mark Wahlberg comes off as more of an entitled jerk. Bratty and self-destructive make for a bad combination and its what we get from the title character this time around. See photos American Horror Story to True Detective 8 Anthology Series That Are Changing TV This new ""Gambler"" will no doubt be enjoyed more by those who never saw the original written by James Toback and directed by Karel Reisz and not just because the first movies journey from New York to Vegas has now been downsized to a day-trip from L.A. to the Morongo Casino. Hollywood of four decades ago was more willing to bum out its audiences to plunge into the depths of humanity without offering up any kind of respite; in 2014 neither casinos nor studio movies are what they used to be. Wahlberg stars as Jim Bennett who bailed on literature after one novel and now teaches at an unnamed Los Angeles college. He comes from a wealthy background; grandpa (George Kennedy) was a banking magnate who dies in the first scene leaving Jim nothing while mom Roberta (Jessica Lange) manages the purse strings. Early on we see Jim attend an underground gambling party where he loses money borrows more and loses that too all in front of one of his students Amy (Brie Larson) whos a cater-waitress. Already in debt to Korean mobsters and to loanshark Neville (Michael K. Williams ""The Wire"") Jim hits up the foreboding Frank (John Goodman at his most intimidating) for money but Frank sees Jim for the bad risk that he is. (In one of many on-the-nose lines of dialogue in William Monahans script Amy later observes about Jim ""Youre one of those guys who started out with no problems at all and now you have all of them."") There can be fascination in watching a downward spiral but as written here by Monahan (""The Departed"") and directed by Rupert Wyatt (""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"") Jim comes off as a spoiled whiner who deserves not only the punishment the film heaps upon him but also a few extra helpings. See video Mark Wahlberg John Goodman Say F-ck You a Lot in The Gambler Trailer (Video) Wahlberg to his credit does make a believable college professor complete with glasses and discussions of Shakespeare and Camus even if some of his bounding-into-the-audience mannerisms lead to ""The Mirror Has Two Faces"" levels of incredulity. At the same time he has a disconcerting habit here of talking faster as a way to convey a variety of emotions from impatience to disappointment to intellectual rationalizations. Wahlbergs a fine actor one whos equally magnetic as hero or heel but his work in ""The Gambler"" counts as one of his occasional miscalculations. What Wahlberg fails to accomplish is to make us interested in Jims plight and his addiction; it was one thing for Wahlberg to shrink back and allow the larger-than-life supporting characters of ""The Fighter"" to take center stage but this is a case where its on him to give us someone in whom we can be invested even if that investment leads to loathing or pity. (His performance doesnt just pale emotionally against Caans but visually as well Wyatt reenacts the earlier films iconic upward shot of the character framed by the casino ceiling but this time around it doesnt pop.) Once again however Wahlberg finds himself surrounded by a top-flight cadre of actors with Lange and Goodman getting some of their meatiest film roles in ages and Williams commanding the screen in a way that the movies have rarely offered him before now. Also read Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg Will Compete For Kids Affection in Daddys Home Wyatt and cinematographer Greig Fraser (""Zero Dark Thirty"") get a great deal of mileage from their L.A. locations from the hills to the desert to downtown with a mud-slide dream sequence thrown in for good measure. The director also makes the blackjack sequences so tense and exciting that you wish that same level of engagement spilled over to the rest of the movie. Composers Jon Brion and Theo Green offer up a score thats both chilling and propulsive but music supervisor Clint Bennett could have eased up on obvious choices like ""Money"" and ""Creep"" even though were getting cover versions. And a cover version is pretty much what this do-over of ""The Gambler"" represents with the rougher edges mixed out and sweetened. Its no mystery why actors and directors want to relive the magic of American studio movies from the fabled 1970s but if youre not going to take the risks that the originals did or illuminate as much about the characters why redo them at all?
