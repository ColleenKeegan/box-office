Kate Taylor The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 21 2011 600AM EDT Last updated Friday Oct. 21 2011 1130AM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Lets face it The spy spoof is a redundancy. The James Bond franchise descended into self-parody decades ago and shows no sign of moving anywhere else. The bumbling agent Latham Rowan Atkinsons entry into this unnecessary genre was originally only intended to fill one-minute credit-card commercials before he was renamed Johnny English and launched onto the big screen in 2003. It has taken his producers almost a decade to mount a sequel to a project born of such unpromising origins. The world is not exactly waiting with bated breath for Johnny English Reborn. Buts thats okay because like the incompetent spy himself this is a comedy that will sneak up on the skeptical and defy low expectations producing something smart enough to neatly balance the thrills and the yuks. We begin in - where else? - the mountains of Tibet where a traumatized Johnny English has retreated to a monastery to learn self-discipline after some fiasco in Mozambique that cost him his knighthood and got him fired from British Intelligence. Recalled to London because a rogue CIA agent insists he will only negotiate with English the spy is given his assignment by a snooty female boss (Gillian Anderson) with a cat and trotted along to the ""toy shop"" where he is outfitted with various amazing gadgets including a voice-directed Rolls Royce. So far director Oliver Parker and writers William Davies and Hamish McColl (working with characters created by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade) seem to think satire consists merely of reproducing cliches. Exotic locale? Check. Spectacular technology? Check. Person with weird thing for cats? Check. But as Johnny sets off to meet the CIA agent in Hong Kong we find ourselves not merely in the glittering Macau casino but also in a fleabag Kowloon hotel that looks surprisingly like well a fleabag Kowloon hotel. Gradually the film asserts its own personality with a storyline that eschews the figure of a master villain plotting to take over the world in favour of an assassination attempt on the Chinese premier engineered by a traitorous British agent (a roguish Dominic West) helped along by a chilling Chinese cleaning lady (an unstoppable Pik Sen Lim). Its not wildly original but it stands on its own effectively enough to actually build the suspense viewers need to care about the outcome - when not simply enjoying a wheelchair race through the streets of London or a shootout in a careening gondola lift in the Swiss Alps. On the comedy side Atkinson fans might feel that there are too few bits of his vintage clowning too few moments like the one where he silently disrupts a meeting with the Prime Minister through his disastrous experiments with the mechanism that raises and lowers his chair but the point here is to stop star turns from hijacking the film. Using the humiliation of that episode in Mozambique as his back story Atkinson successfully builds some kind of character beyond the clown a man whose contradictory mix of sly self-regard and repeated cock-ups masks a basic insecurity. That then neatly justifies his otherwise improbable relationship with the films love interest the secret-service psychologist Kate (Rosamund Pike). In Daniel Kaluuyas agent Tucker an earnest neophyte who sees through Johnnys delusions but is too polite to say anything Atkinson has found a lovely straight man who oh-so-delicately keeps his place while the funny man does the business. The strength of their on-screen relationship is one of several things that keep this comedy on track. Johnny English Reborn is funny enough to make you laugh and plausible enough in an exploding-umbrella type of way to make you care. Not bad for the sequel to a jumped-up credit-card commercial.

(AP Photo/Universal Pictures Giles Keyte) Giles Keyte In this film image released by Universal Pictures Williams Belle left and Rowan Atkinson are shown in a scene from ""Johnny English Reborn"". (AP Photo/Universal Pictures Giles Keyte) A few years ago in China I met a nightclub DJ who said he loved all things Western. ""Especially"" he added ""Nirvana and Mr. Bean.""Rowan Atkinsons mostly silent Mr. Bean character was an international phenomenon that eluded the United States. In effect it was an homage to French comic Jacques Tati. Atkinsons character called Johnny English revived for this sequel to a secret-agent comedy that few Americans saw is his homage to Peter Sellers in ""The Pink Panther.""In the name of justice we must declare that ""Johnny English Reborn"" is murder to behold. Since botching an operation in Mozambique that resulted in a presidents assassination hapless agent English has been studying meditation and martial arts in Tibet. When British intelligence catches wind of a plot to assassinate a Chinese leader English is called out of retirement by the spy chief (Gillian Anderson) to the amusement of debonair rival Ambrose (Dominic West).As in every spy movie and spoof since ""Dr. No"" English is equipped with the latest microgadgets and is dispatched to an exotic locale -- in this case Macau where he learns from a CIA agent (Richard Schiff) that the assassination weapon requires three keys that are distributed to villains around the world.Bungling his way from a casino to a country club to an Alpine fortress English is aided by a loyal sidekick (Daniel Kaluuya) studied by a lovely psychologist (Rosamund Pike) and shadowed by a lethal cleaning lady (Pik Sen Lim). Unlike Sellers Inspector Clouseau Atkinsons twitchy-eyed Johnny English is a character with a single trait -- stupidity -- so the jokes at his own expense have no punch. At gunpoint I might confess to smiling when English pummeled the Queen of England with a tea tray but the babysitters for the target audience will know that his best bits are burgled from Austin Powers.For anyone expecting the second coming of Clouseau ""Johnny English Reborn"" is a karmic catastrophe.

Americans can be forgiven if they dont remember the 2003 James Bond spoof ""Johnny English with British comic Rowan Atkinson which collected the vast majority of its 160 million in worldwide grosses elsewhere -- the only possible explanation for this belated and totally unnecessary sequel. ""Johnny English Reborn sounds like a reboot but its actually a tired recycling of something that wasnt exactly fresh to begin with. It would seem to appeal mostly to hard-core fans of the ""Mr. Bean star and children who laugh at the sight of men being repeatedly kicked in the groin. Though stretched out for what feels like three hours the nonsensical plot could be inscribed on the head of a pin. Exiled to a lamasery in Tibet after he failed to prevent an assassination there disgraced former MI7 agent English is recalled to prevent a plot to kill the Chinese prime minister. The now-graying Atkinson is a master of slapstick but for me at least a little of his clowning -- including a mistaken-identity gag that like several others gets beaten to death -- goes a very long way. He isnt helped by the hamfisted direction of Oliver Parker who was responsible for two of the most lamentable British films of recent years ""Saint Trinians and the direct-to-DVD ""Dorian Gray both starring Colin Firth. Firth wisely sat this far more expensive-looking production out allowing Parker to instead squander the talents of Gillian Anderson (as Johnnys new boss as whats now acquired corporate sponsorship as ""Toshiba MI7) and erstwhile Bond girl Rosamund Pike as his very nominal love interest. ""Johnny English concludes with an elaborate and endless sequence set at a Swiss mountaintop fortress where the left and right hands of our hero -- one which is mind-controlled by rogue agent Dominic West -- struggle for a gun. All I could think of was how much better Steve Martin handled the same gag in ""All of Me.

(Victoria Will/AP) BY Elizabeth Weitzman DAILY NEWS MOVIE CRITIC Friday October 21 2011 400 AM BEING ELMO -- 3 STARSBiography of puppeteer Kevin Clash. At the IFC (116). NR.Before you write off this documentary from Constance Marks and Philip Shane be aware that its not what youre expecting. You dont need to be a toddler a parent or a puppeteer to be touched. In fact even Oscar the Grouch would be moved by the inspiring history of Kevin Clash the man who gives Elmo his voice.Clashs biography is a classic American tale blessed with talent and persistence he knew at an early age that he wanted to wind up on Sesame Street. So he worked hard and then harder until he was noticed by none other than Jim Henson.Though hes since experienced extraordinary success he doesnt seem to take a moment for granted. Marks and Shane are a little too awed by their subject and the movie which is narrated by Whoopi Goldberg could use more depth. Still its easy to see how the filmmakers got caught up in such a generous heartwarming story. For any adult feeling overwhelmed by bad news and dark times your antidote is right here. JOHNNY ENGLISH REBORN -- 1 STARComedy about an inept British spy. At area theaters (141). PG violence crude humor.Its very existence does suggest that someone must have been waiting impatiently for a sequel to 2003s ""Johnny English."" But unless that superfan is you theres not much to recommend about this airless spy spoof.Now forcibly retired Rowan Atkinsons titular agent has been called back into action by a new boss (Gillian Anderson who should be doing much better for herself). An international gang plans to assassinate the Chinese premier and its up to English to stop him. First though he has to make it out the door without tripping over his shoelaces.It must be said that everyone--including Dominic West and Rosamund Pike--works awfully hard to entertain us. But that just makes it all the more depressing when joke after joke falls painfully flat. Stay home and introduce your kids to Mr. Bean instead. THE REUNION -- 1 STARSquabbling brothers solve a kidnapping. At the Quad (135). PG-13 sexuality violence language.Frequently ludicrous and cheerfully inept Michael Pavones action comedy does manage to eke out a few drops of slapdash charm.Sam (John Cena) Leo (Ethan Embry) and Doug (Boyd Holbrook) are the three brothers who learn via their sister (Amy Smart) that their abusive father has died. Hes left them millions but the only way they can inherit it is to join together in a family business. Leo suggests they do some detective work tracking down a kidnapped mogul (Gregg Henry) in Mexico. So off they go causing chaos and destruction at every turn.Pavones preferred style is frantic and unfocused Embry makes his already-irritating character nearly unbearable and its tough to find Smart stuck in junk like this. As for WWE star Cena lets just say hell never unseat The Rock outside the ring. But Holbrook is likable and Lela Loren brings some much-needed dignity as the woman who guides the brothers to their bounty.Then again the only real reason to see this movie is to show unwavering loyalty to Cena. And even so hell never know if you wait to watch it on cable for free.LE HAVRE -- 3 STARSAn aging Frenchman helps a young African immigrant. At the Lincoln Plaza IFC (133). NR. In French with subtitles.Finlands submission for Best Foreign Language Film is actually set on the coast of France (in the port city of Le Havre) where a cargo-load of African refugees is discovered and turned back. A somber teen (Blondin Miguel) escapes and is protected by an idealistic shoe shiner (Andre Wilms) with his own problems. The police are determined to find the kid however so it will take an entire community to deter them. The odds are grim but director Aki Kaurismaki believes in the power of wishful thinking. No one looks at the world quite like Kaurismaki and his deadpan sentimentality is worth discovery. This is a good place to start.

Rowan Atkinsons agent is back in action after picking up some martial-arts moves from Tibetan monks.Sponsored LinksAt the expense of James Bond no less.No one is going to confuse Agent English (Rowan Atkinson) for the next 007. For starters English couldnt pick up a femme fatale with a wheelbarrow. He tends to whale on elderly women he mistakes for assassins. If anything English is a spy of cerebral reduction not deduction.VIDEO See the trailerStill his film is just good-natured enough to make it a safe romp for kids and a passable 90 minutes-plus for adults. While the laughs arent non-stop Atkinson dials down the physical shtick a bit allowing the film some sly jokes that attentive parents may appreciate -- particularly those familiar with the conventions of spy flicks.The humor isnt as dual-edged as say a Pixar comedy. But director Oliver Parker knows his genre well enough to lampoon the mainstays of the spy-flick genre from impossibly high-tech weapons to foot chases worthy of Olympic medals.About the movieJohnny English Reborn   1/2 out of fourStars Rowan Atkinson Gillian Anderson Dominic WestDirector Oliver Parker Distributor Universal Pictures Rating PG for mild action violence rude humor some language and brief sensuality Running time 1 hour 41 minutes Opens Friday nationwideHere though weapons misfire and hit the wrong targets and English is a lot more fond of an elevator than a sprint.The story begins with English in a Tibetan monastery where the humiliated agent has fled to find his mental stability and some martial arts tips. The humor largely a jab at the Kung Fu TV series works here primarily because the monks have trained themselves to go numb in the nether regions. English is recalled to MI7 the British secret-service agency run by Pegasus (Gillian Anderson) an M-styled boss from the Bond era. Anderson handles a British accent well though her face tends to be frozen in wide-eyed surprise.And there are surprises particularly when we meet Quartermain (Tim McInnerny) who has blown off most of his appendages with secret weapons hes tried first on himself. Here chairs get their first comedic turn as Quartermain introduces a wheelchair capable of highway speeds. Later English will struggle with chairlifts bean-bag seats and desk chairs that seem to elevate and drop on their own.Its breezy stuff to be sure. And while English is far from becoming the Pink Panther for the Facebook generation Atkinson has a breezy rapport with junior Agent Tucker (Daniel Kaluuya) thats reminiscent of Peter Sellers Inspector Clouseau and his relationship with sidekick Kato.Light-years ahead of the 2003 original Reborn has some laugh-out-loud moments especially when English accidentally sets off a spy panic alarm that for some reason shrieks for help and sends flares to pinpoint an agents location. And who can resist a low-speed low-altitude helicopter chase set to David Souls Dont Give Up On Us?English doesnt quite make the grade. The film loses momentum when Atkinson gets overtly physical in his fight and flight sequences. His humor is in his caterpillar eyebrows not his ordinary physique. And English is still too long with a few false endings to tie loose ends.But at a time when action has become all effects and quick cuts its a pleasure watching Johnny English take the lift (with Muzak) to the top of a skyscraper while his nemesis runs. And the guy falls in love in ways spies never do deeply. Bond need not worry about job security but hes got competition thats easily stirred if not shaken.

Starring Rowan Atkinson Gillian Anderson and Rosamund Pike. Directed by Oliver Parker. (PG. 101 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Johnny English wants to be cool. So do the rest of us so were on to him. We recognize the symptoms. At the same time Johnny has no chance of ever achieving his goal and so we laugh. We see who hes trying to be and see who he really is and the depthless gulf between fantasy and reality is at the heart of the humor. The more Johnny tries to hide his discomfort and cover his mistakes the more naked he becomes - and the more funny. ""Johnny English Reborn"" a spy thriller spoof and the sequel to the 2003 ""Johnny English"" is an ideal vehicle for the gifts of Rowan Atkinson a superb physical comedian. He is also in his way an actor with a marvelous talent for conveying thin but blustery confidence that often gives way to suppressed humiliation and eye-darting panic. One recurring characteristic of Johnny is that he always fidgets with objects as a way of diffusing discomfort and expanding into space in ways he thinks are suave. But every time he does something happens - he knocks a cat out the window shoots things decapitates a mannequin poisons himself ... As comic creations go Johnny is fairly complex - a mix of capable and asinine - slightly smarter than Inspector Clouseau but less effective than Maxwell Smart. And hes a comic gold mine. Most of ""Johnny English Reborn"" is funny but some of it is hysterically funny with two big laughs just in the first two minutes. If I told you that the opening sequence takes place at a martial arts training school in Asia wouldnt you be disappointed and expect a series of comic cliches? ""Beverly Hills Ninja"" pretty much drained that milk shake in 1997 - but no. The screenwriters find new veins of humor. Related Stories ""Johnny English Reborn"" keeps laughs coming Review Johnny English Reborn The story revolves around - wait do you care? OK a little? - Johnnys attempt to stop a consortium of international assassins from striking again. This is enough of a story to engage audience interest and in fact there might be slightly too much story. The movie feels about 10 minutes too long. Still the laughs including the big laughs keep coming right up to the closing seconds. E-mail Mick LaSalle at mlasallesfchronicle.com.

"Johnny English Reborn Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-EntertainmentMovie review Johnny English RebornRowan Atkinson stars in the slapstick spy spoof.October 21 2011|By Robert Abele Special to the Los Angeles Times Rowan Atkinson and Rosamund Pike in ""Johnny English Reborn."" (Giles Keyte / Universal...)Like any international spy movie worth its salt ""Johnny English Reborn"" boasts helicopter stunts exotic locations choreographed fighting and nifty gadgets. But because this is a comedy starring gifted British comic actor Rowan Atkinson whats more memorable (and hilariously so) is the simplest form of decorum-puncturing mayhem an adjustable office chair that wont stop adjusting during a meeting with the prime minister. Atkinsons agent acts as if nothing untoward is happening in a sequence thats entirely reminiscent of his forebear Peter Sellers staring at that ever-unrolling toilet paper in ""The Party."" MI-7 agent English is the newer bumbler in Atkinsons canon after rubbery Everyman Mr. Bean last seen in the 2007 comedy ""Mr. Beans Holiday."" Good-natured Beans speechless innocent shenanigans may be more classically iconic but English a introduced in the 2003 worldwide hit ""Johnny English"" a gives Atkinson a chance to add to his prodigious slapstick abilities a well-honed gift (seen to best effect on the BBC sitcom ""Black Adder"") for hundred-yard-stare arrogance and a withering baritone. The gangly performer can combine the two in the subtlest of ways for brilliant effect and its often the saving grace in what is an otherwise routine vehicle for Atkinsons talents. So while a Tibetan mountain prologue setting up Englishs long exile from Her Majestys Secret Service spits out the requisite kung fu training gags its watching the actors stoic mug develop a twitchy eye a sparked by anyone referring to the failed mission that ruined his reputation a that brings the most delicately silly comic pleasure. Elsewhere writer Hamish McColl and director Oliver Parker attempt to update spoof elements to reflect recent trends in spy movies namely the parkour action of ""Casino Royale"" and the ""Bourne"" movies faced with a roof-hopping wall-scaling villain English casually takes the elevator. Then theres the real-life privatization of government which leads to one of the better jokes that MI-7 is now ""Toshiba British Intelligence."" The story though is a hodgepodge of espionage flick tropes. Coming in from the cold English and an eager young sidekick (Daniel Kaluuya) are tasked by the chief (Gillian Anderson) to uncover an assassination ring plotting to take out the Chinese premier. Along the way our hero feels the competition from a smooth-talking hot-shot agent (Dominic West); develops a fondness for a fetching behavioral psychologist (Rosamund Pike); and has disastrous run-ins with an elderly assassin whose weapon is a tricked-out vacuum cleaner. But all that matters with efforts like this is whether the cookie-cutter plotting serves up enough situations for Atkinson to contort himself into and out of jams. After all are the narratives what you remember from the ""Pink Panther"" movies? Or the silly things like that Clouseau could so easily get his finger caught in a spinning globe? calendarlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESJack Ryan Shadow Recruit competent not compelling...January 17 2014Capsule Movie ReviewsNovember 25 2011Hes so smooth so suaveJuly 18 2003Movie Review  Man With One Red Shoe ShinesJuly 19 1985MORE STORIES ABOUTEntertainmentSpyCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-johnny-english-reborn-20111021,0,7177919.story?track=rss",200,johnnyenglishreborn7,johnnyenglishreborn,latimes

Lets pray those contemplating this needless effort show a little intelligence and stay far away from any theater foolish enough to screen it. Who is Johnny English youre probably wondering and why was there a need for him to be ""Reborn"" on screen? Well Atkinsons creation is a clueless agent on Her Majestys secret service who would rank somewhere below randy Austin Powers and the incompetent Inspector Clouseau if one were to make a flow chart of international men of mystery. Hes back in this by-the-numbers sequel because the original ""Johnny English"" released in 2003 earned an impressive 160.5 million at the global box office. Only 28 million came from the States proving that U.S. audiences have better taste than theyre usually given credit for. But any film posting those types of numbers earns the right to produce a follow-up tepid as it may be. ""Reborn"" certainly globetrots like a Bond sequel with listless action sequences set in London Hong Kong and Switzerland (or more accurately soundstages made to look like all of the above). Against her better judgment MI7 head Pegasus (Gillian Anderson) reinstates the retired English (Atkinson) when the agency uncovers an elaborate plot to assassinate Chinas premier using a mind-control drug. Along the way English mingles with stock characters on loan from the time-tested Bond formula. Kate (Rosamund Pike) is the beautiful brainy female spy whos tough sensitive and slowly falling for our hero. Eager but untested rookie agent Tucker (Daniel Kaluuya) cant understand why hes so much smarter than his supposed mentor. And then theres Englishs chief rival Ambrose the near-perfect spy played by handsome Dominic West (who cant stop smirking probably because hes thinking of the yacht hell purchase using his ""English"" paycheck). I spent most of ""Johnny English"" wondering whom the filmmakers were targeting. While childish and silly its far too violent for young kids. Jokes attempted by ""English"" worked better in the ""Ace Ventura"" and ""Austin Powers"" franchises where we first saw them. And spy genre fanatics patiently waiting for the next James Bond installment quickly will grow bored with this predictable plot even as ""English"" director Oliver Parker wastes large chunks of time advancing a criminal scheme youll care very little about. Part of the reason the first ""Johnny English"" occasionally hit its target is because longtime James Bond screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade (""Casino Royale"" ""Die Another Day"" ""The World Is Not Enough"") penned the script and were in on the joke. Writing duties for ""Reborn"" shift to Hamish McColl who previously collaborated with Atkinson on 2007s ""Mr. Beans Holiday"" and still appears to be dreaming up bits for the limber comedians silent character. Visual gimmicks involving such everyday items as a golf club an adjustable seat and a motorized wheelchair feel like reheated bits from Atkinsons ""Mr. Bean"" days. Atkinson has amassed a loyal following that will no doubt support ""English"" in theaters. But most will leave disappointed thinking ""Bean there done that.""Contains mild action violence rude humor some language and brief sensuality.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Theres something inherently quaint about James Bond spoofs these days. The Bond franchise may veer light or dark grittily realistic or breezily escapist but Bond parodies spoofs and homages all seem locked in the same 70s time warp of free-flowing martinis nifty gadgets and regressive sexual politics. Johnny English Reborn the tardy sequel to the 2003 international hit takes place in the present but tonally it recalls a bygone era when Roger Moore led Ian Flemings iconic spy franchise merrily down the road to self-parody. Rubber-faced Rowan Atkinson returns as the title character a hotshot spy and unrepentant chauvinist who goes into seclusion in the Far East (a la Rambo and later MacGruber) after a mission goes horribly awry. Hes roped back into service years later to help track down a sinister organization that has planted moles in the worlds top spy agencies and has designs on the Chinese premier. Gillian Anderson stops by to trot out an impeccable British accent and look pained during Atkinsons trademark shenanigans in a wasted performance as his much-embarrassed superior. Johnny English Reborns sharpest gags riff on its protagonists unshakeable Britishness. In the films drollest joke Atkinson uses an uncharacteristic bout of common sense to find solutions to his problems during a chase while his adversary dramatically scurries over barbed wire and otherwise puts himself in woefully unnecessary danger. That bit of sly humor proves the exception rather than the rule Johnny English Reborn is otherwise content to pursue the low-hanging fruit of indifferently executed physical-comedy setpieces malfunctioning high-tech gizmos and multiple shots to the groin. Atkinson gleans a few laughs from the contrast between his lascivious bedroom eyes and spastic physical comedy but he can only do so much to elevate material this hopelessly mild.

The hugely talented Atkinson does his best with the predictable script and is enthusiastically abetted by the likes of Gillian Anderson Dominic West and the comedians onetime Blackadder costar Tim McInnerny.

E-mail| Print| Text size - + You probably werent clamoring for a sequel to the 2003 British spy parody ""Johnny English"" which was far more successful overseas than it was in the United States.Still heres ""Johnny English Reborn"" again starring Rowan Atkinson. As the secret agent of the title Johnny thinks hes as suave and resourceful as James Bond. Mostly though he bumbles his way from one situation to the next with the help of all the obligatory weapons and gadgets none of which is terribly clever or creative.Johnny is back at the agency MI7 (hardy har har) after a few years away with a bit of a stigma attached to him. Seems he massively messed up an assignment in Mozambique and his new boss Pegasus (Gillian Anderson trotting out her flat British accent again) lets him know she wont tolerate those kinds of mistakes.For his next job Johnny must find out who is behind a plot to assassinate the Chinese premier. And even though hes been training in the remote mountains of Tibet all this time (in an admittedly amusing montage) Johnny still isnt quite up for the challenge.Director Oliver Parkers film relies on much of the same tired repetitive spy spoofs as the ""Austin Powers"" movies and much of the same false confidence in the face of absurd danger. That any of this works ever is a testament to Atkinsons skills as a comedian. You can sense him slumming and straining but hes so gifted physically he makes pretty idiotic material more enjoyable than it should be. Slapstick requires a delicacy and finesse that Atkinson most certainly possesses but the writing just isnt there.Rosamund Pike brings her usual combination of beauty and smarts to the role of the agencys psychologist and manages to provide a bit more substance than was available to her on the page. But even given her formidable presence its hard to believe that her character would ever give Johnny the time of day much less fall for him. Dominic West meanwhile co-stars as a fellow agent who is so obviously sleazy and menacing from the start theres nowhere else for his character to go.Johnny English isnt reborn so much as reheated and his aim hasnt improved after all these years.""Johnny English Reborn"" a Universal Pictures release is rated PG for mild action violence rude humor some language and brief sensuality.

More a resuscitation than a rebirth ""Johnny English Reborn"" finds British comedian Rowan Atkinson reviving his spoof spy character with this enjoyable if somewhat wheezy reprise. A belated follow-up to the franchises 2003 opening installment pic sticks to the James Bond spoof template in its story structure and use of exotic locales like Hong Kong and the Alps and shows Atkinsons flair for bodily and facial contortions can still generate family-friendly laffs. Pics Oz preem pre-empted the international release schedule by a few weeks; pic will roll out across Europe in early October and Oct. 28 Stateside. MI7-operative Johnny English (Atkinson) is recalled from a Tibetan monastery to which the disgraced agent voluntarily retreated after botching a vital mission in Mozambique five years earlier. Opening sequences show a bearded ponytailed English in martial-arts training with results both predictable and unexpected. This sets the standard of humor to follow; much of the film frequently raises smiles but substantial belly laughs are more sporadic. Back at MI7s London HQ English finds the Blighty secret-service agency has a new CEO. In line with the Bond franchise which replaced Bernard Lee with Judi Dench Englishs new boss is no-nonsense businesswoman Pegasus (Gillian Anderson sporting a passable English accent) who has overseen the corporate privatization of the agency and its sale to a Japanese technology company. Also quickly introduced are MI7 staff behavioral psychologist Kate Sumner (""Die Another Day"" Bond girl Rosamund Pike) and Englishs fellow agent and old friend Simon Ambrose (a smooth Dominic West) who wastes no time reminding English of his Mozambique disaster. Signaling his trauma Englishs right eye goes into spasm in synch with the soundtracks African drums every time Mozambique is mentioned. Although several blunders -- insulting the prime minister and beating up an innocent old woman among them -- do nothing to endear the titular klutz to his new boss English is sent to Hong Kong on a new mission. There hes paired up with junior Agent Tucker (Daniel Kaluuya) who natch is more on the ball than his mentor. In a Kowloon tenement the two rendezvous with renegade CIA agent Titus Fisher (a gruff Richard Schiff) who reveals hes part of a three-way alliance called Vortex which possesses a chemical weapon of which one of his treacherous partners an MI7 mole seeks solitary control. Englishs mishandling of the case sees both him and Tucker suspended from the operation while the MI7 mole proceeds to frame the bumbling British spy for any mayhem he hasnt caused. Screenplay leans more heavily on the Bond films for inspiration than the first ""Johnny English"" pic did winking at the ""Goldfinger"" golf game and sampling the snowmobile chase from ""On Her Majestys Secret Service."" Other references run rampant as well The Tibetan monk in the opening sequence recalls ""Kung Fu"" while Englishs fights with an aging Asian assassin (Pik Sen-lim) derivatively recall his Gallic counterpart Inspector Clouseaus battles with his own Eastern manservant. Atkinson takes advantage of a souped-up wheelchair and a stunt team to provide comic action but the gags that work best are the simple ones. English playing with lipstick while under the influence of an unpronounceable drug or being unable to control the vertical function of an office chair provide greater satisfaction than the more technology-derived stunts. The other thesps hit their marks and make their characters as convincing as circumstances allow but feel like wallpaper next to the stars grin-inducing shenanigans. Less amusing is the (hopefully) unintended racist slur in which an arrogant English refers to his black sidekick as ""You clever boy."" Its a tacky moment in an otherwise inoffensive film. While Atkinsons timing remains impeccable ""St Trinians"" helmer Oliver Parker has a tendency to undercut the comedic impact of all but the most obvious gags. Lensing by Danny Cohen lends the pic a shiny veneer and Ilan Eshkeris score plays it pretty straight preferring to let the comedy speak for itself.

A ho-hum sequel to a so-so original whose central character was funnier in a credit-card commercial? Eight years after his first celluloid airing Rowan Atkinsons Bean-meets-Bond creation gets to bungle another day. This time the filmmakers take the plot more seriously bringing MI-7s least special agent out of retirement for a rendezvous in Hong Kong he uncovers a conspiracy to eliminate the Chinese premier during talks with the British PM. The calculation is that Atkinsons practised buffoonery will play funnier if theres something at stake. Yet in reality it means the movie has to put on a relatively straight face to keep the plot ticking over while parcelling out the laughs in discrete sketches.Some of the hi-jinks are amusing including an eye-watering training session at a temple and deadpan stuff with a powered office chair. But too often the gags are smile-worthy not thigh-slapping. Thankfully the supporting cast are on good form especially Daniel Kaluuyas keen youthful sidekick and Dominic West as a suave MI-7 colleague though Rosamund Pike doesnt have enough to do as a body-language expert and uneasy love interest. Director Oliver Parker (the St Trinians films) tries his best to inject some zip into the anodyne action highlights but fights a losing battle. Its very undemanding though the enthusiastic granny bashing does provide a quantum of solace.

It is a film for kids and as such was extremely funny and completely tongue in cheek I even enjoyed it myself for his comic timing and elastic movements.

Rowan Atkinson was not once entertaining and continuinley annoyed and frustrated me throughout the entire film.

Daily Edition Login to download Johnny English Reborn Film Review 201 PM PDT 9/18/2011 by Megan Lehmann FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS A redundant spy farce sequel thats less of a rebirth than a retread. TWITTER Elastic-faced British comedian Rowan Atkinson has another go at playing the inept M17 spy. SYDNEY -- Its been a particularly long time between martinis for James Bond fans but dont go relying on the bumbling British spy farce Johnny English Reborn to step into the breach. Even the most desperately deprived secret-agent devotee will find little to cheer in this yawn-tastic 007 send-up. Has anyone really been clamouring for a sequel to 2003s Johnny English itself a formulaic parody based - incredibly enough - on a series of British credit card commercials starring the loose-limbed elastic-faced comedian Rowan Atkinson? Still even with its sophomoric set-ups and jokes you could see coming a mile away the original pulled in an impressive 160 million worldwide. Theres no reason to expect that the sequel in which the dunderheaded MI7 spook of the title is recalled from exile to stop a triumvirate of assassins wont draw similar numbers of undiscerning Anglophiles and youngsters who find incessant granny-bashing funny. It opens in the U.S. October 28 after an international roll-out that kicked off in Australia September 15. Eight years on from Johnny English Atkinson appears to have been engulfed by an ambitionless malaise. Apart from a scene-stealing cameo as a jewelry salesman in Love Actually his only other film of note has been another sequel Mr Beans Holiday. PHOTOS Summer Movie Guide But this films minimal laugh-to-gag ratio is not his fault. Director Oliver Parkers(Dorian Gray St. Trinians) pacing is off and the screenplay by Hamish McColl(Mr Beans Holiday) from a story by William Davies (How to Train Your Dragon Johnny English) fails to provide a lively enough framework for this gifted and intelligent actors unique physical comedy. Though graying at the temples Atkinson still gamely runs through his repertoire of po-faced pratfalls and amusing eyebrow gymnastics. Best known in America as his other alter ego Mr. Bean Atkinson has raised epic silliness to an art form and many find his gentle old-fashioned style a welcome shelter from the squall of profanity-dependent comedy. Since we last encountered English the pompous accident-prone spy has been stripped of his knighthood ignominiously booted out of MI7 and banished to a Tibetan monastery after some unpleasant business in Mozambique. The prologue seems to exist solely as an elaborate set-up for a long-delayed crotch joke but soon he is recalled to London by MI7s ""M""-like chief Pamela Thornton (Gillian Anderson who seems to be channelling Pearce Brosnan rather than Judi Dench). The British intelligence agency (now sponsored by Toshiba in a self-referential nod to the films own product placement) has unearthed a plot to assassinate the Chinese premier involving a set of three interlocking keys a mind-control drug and sketchy elements hiding within KGB CIA and MI7 itself. English is the only person the informant will speak to and so he is reluctantly dispatched along with astute young greenhorn Agent Tucker (Daniel Kaluuya) on a mission to stop the would-be killers from triggering global chaos. STORY Mr Bean Star Rowan Atkinson Wrecks Million Dollar McLaren F1 Supercar Walks Away Cue a series of grand disasters accidental triumphs and much buffoonery - the best of which comes when Atkinson is really let off the leash as when he mistakenly ingests a drug that triggers a good deal of virtuoso flailing. Beyond a handful of standout set pieces - theres a terrific bit with a smug Johnny English using elevators and ladders to outpace an agile villain during a rooftop chase - the general vibe is one of laziness. The action is by-the-numbers and the ungainly machinations of the plot are familiar from countless spy spoofs from Maxwell Smart on giving a lie to the rejuvenation promised by the title. It would be far better to see Johnny English reborn on the big screen as another Atkinson character altogether the hilarious Blackadder from the BBC mock-historical series of the same name. The supporting cast is solid from Rosamund Pike(a former Bond Girl from Die Another Day) as a behavioral psychologist and unlikely love interest to Dominic West(The Wire) as Englishs idol Agent One. There are some pleasing diversions through Hong Kong and the French Alps and the look of the film is first-rate thanks to cinematographer Danny Cohen (The Kings Speech) production designer Jim Clay (Children of Men Love Actually) and costume designer Beatrix Pasztor (Vanity Fair Good Will Hunting.)
