Entertainment Inc. and Legendary Pictures Funding LLC Critics Note This review was written before the horrendous shooting in Colorado at the midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises. Already Ive read musings on the wisdom of midnight shows which seems to me a ridiculous issue and the wisdom of easy access to weapons an issue that couldnt be less ridiculous. Some wonder whether the suspect reportedly dressed in black and wearing a gas mask was modeling himself on the films villain Bane or even Batman. It is irresponsible to tie the act of a sociopath to The Dark Knight Rises. But it would be irresponsible not to say that one of the most disturbing aspects of the prevailing vigilantism and vengeance motifs in modern action cinema is that anyone can style himself a vigilante revenger. With The Dark Knight Rises Christopher Nolan brings to a close the most ambitious cycle of superhero films ever made. Here as in Batman Begins and The Dark Knight he explores both the consequences of doing nothing in a lawless world and the consequences of doing the right thing (fighting crime) for the wrong reason (personal revenge). He muses on the mask as a source of power over others -- and a source of havoc on ones own identity. Implicitly he asks whether justice can be attained in a society that strives to balance the desire for order with the rights of the individual. Whatever else The Dark Knight Rises is or isnt its big -- very big. Its also very long closing in on three hours with not a lot of Batman to show for it but plenty of Christian Bales Bruce Wayne dragging his broken body around and looking sad while people make speeches at him. The Dark Knight rises -- for maybe fifteen minutes then gets knocked on his ass again. Of course its not as if Nolan fans (Nolanoids) have anywhere else to go. Theyll resent having to give up their seats. The movie opens with Wayne a bearded recluse still in mourning for the woman he thought loved him (hell soon find out she loved another) his superhero persona dormant. The dark knight is a fugitive now. Eight years earlier he became a martyr in the cause of justice taking the blame for the murder of district attorney turned mad avenger Harvey ""Two Face"" Dent to protect Dents law-and-order reputation. That seems to have worked like well gangbusters. Under the ""Dent Act"" thousands of gangland types rot behind bars while at least one segment of Gotham City -- the one percent-- lives high on the hog. Beneath them however in the sewers apocalyptic forces amass led by the masked muscleman Bane (Tom Hardy) who wears a sort of black-mandibled breathing apparatus that makes him sound like a cross between Darth Vader Andy Kaufmans Foreign Man and someone trying to sing ""Nessun Dorma"" while choking to death on a mouthful of muesli. In the prologue Bane impressively commandeers a plane kills several CIA agents and kidnaps a man for reasons I almost but didnt quite catch. (It would help to be able to read his lips but he has none.) Then Bane pretends to be a modern French Revolutionary type smashing up the Stock Exchange and exhorting the people of Gotham City (once he has effectively imprisoned them) to seize the assets of the wealthy and redistribute them. Master thief Selina Kyle a.k.a. the Catwoman (Anne Hathaway) makes a lot of class-warfare noises too. (""Theres a storm coming Mr. Wayne. You and your friends better batten down the hatches cause when it hits youre all gonna wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little for the rest of us."") Given that Selina seems a decent sort -- another in a line of witty long-limbed female warriors that movies have recently given us -- we wait for her to throw in her lot with the law-and-order types. Are Nolans politics moving in an elitist direction? Batman was always as comics writer Grant Morrison puts it in his trenchant analysis/memoir Supergods ""the ultimate capitalist hero ... a millionaire who vented his childlike fury on the criminal classes of the lower orders"" and ""the defender of privilege and hierarchy."" But given the timing The Dark Knight Rises effectively portrays Occupy Wall Street as an engine of supervillains to enlist a lot of envious dupes. (Nolan and his cameras poked around lower Manhattan at the height of the protests.) You come away with the notion that the ruling class might have its peccadilloes (fraud systemic racism etc.) but as the Times David Brooks might say it does put a premium on citizenship. If you think this is too much emphasis on politics and philosophy when Batman is after all a comic-book superhero youre not crediting Nolans seriousness. God hes serious -- its a wonder the Dark Knight rises at all under the weight of its themes. Hes capable of startling images not the least of which is Batman in a black so deep and lush it looks like the next stage in the evolution of plastic. But his vision could use more pop. Where Tim Burtons messed-up but thrillingly operatic Batman could suggest by its framing and Michael Keatons tentative movements that its hero was a nut -- so damaged by the murder of his parents he could never move past the tragedy as if Batman were the real man and millionaire Bruce Wayne the disguise -- Nolan has a young policeman John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) deliver an impassioned speech to the effect that he knows Wayne is Batman because he recognizes that Wayne is wearing a mask. Bane gets to hold forth on the subject of his mask too. As Alfred the butler poor Michael Caine -- nasal to start with now barely keeping the lid on his mucous membranes -- tells him to ditch the mask he cant wear anymore. Caine gets the speech that used to be reserved for wives or girlfriends in Westerns ""Ive sewn you up Ive set your bones but I wont watch you die."" Despite the looming annihilation of Gotham City Yenta Alfred urges Master Wayne to start a family -- the most likely prospect being Marion Cotillard as a millionaire businesswoman who has risen to the heights of Wayne Enterprises. I wont spoil anything but most fans know by now that Bane has ties to the late Ras al Ghul Liam Neesons mastermind from Batman Begins who trained and then alienated Bruce with plans to decimate humanity in the name of environmental balance. So the villain in The Dark Knight Rises has the same motives and the same sort of scheme -- which sent me back in time to my disappointment at Return of the Jedi when all the Empire had up its sleeve was ... a bigger Death Star. (We want ... another shrubbery) Actually the climax of Batman Begins (""I wont kill you ... but I dont have to save you"") was less labored and more surprising. The last we see of Bane is a letdown and the chase that features a truck with a giant bomb screeching police cruisers and the Batplane suffers from Nolans usual spatial incoherence. There isnt a lot of suspense if you cant tell whos going where and in which direction. The big finale made me think fondly of Adam Wests frustrated dash amid nuns and baby ducks in his big-screen Batman ""Some days you just cant get rid of a bomb"" The coda is unforgivable -- to be discussed. Its too bad Nolan doesnt go with his strengths. The setup is gorgeous for the assault on a football stadium in which a boy soprano sings the ""Star-Spangled Banner"" and Bane says tenderly before all hell breaks loose ""What a lovely voice."" Bales Batman in his swan song is even more eloquent his delivery wry but with a hint of nostalgia -- he knows this is his last hurrah. (I finally figured out whose twisted mouth and cadences hes channeling -- its Cliff Robertson back from the grave.) Cillian Murphy returns in a marvelous cameo his Scarecrow now a Jacobin judge-jury-and-executioner out of Simon Schamas nightmares perched high atop a desk framed by twin unraveled reams of meaningless paperwork. Its Anne Hathaways movie. Along with everyone else I feared shed be no match for Michelle Pfeiffers campy vampy nutsoid Catwoman in Batman Returns but Nolan wisely takes the role in the opposite direction -- to the point where shes not really a comic-book supervillain anymore. No matter. Hathaway has become a delicious comedian and makes Selina one too a con artist who uses her lithe body teasingly and knows you know she aims to hoodwink you -- just not precisely when. Is Selina a lesbian? Nolan gives her a bedraggled little blonde thing to whom shes mighty attentive. But Batman like James Bond in Goldfinger when he turned Pussy Galore knows how to get under a girls catsuit. Having inspired thousands of abusive posts and e-mails from young Nolanoids barely past puberty after the first bad review of The Dark Knight -- which at the time dealt a blow to all hopes for a score of 100 on the Tomatometer -- I feel duty-bound to say that while I miss the supernatural fury of Heath Ledgers Joker I found The Dark Knight Rises reasonably compelling. But if the Nolanoids had any integrity theyd admit that their heros wrap-up wraps up few of the threads in the first two films and that the climactic cliff-hangers are nothing special (as well as flabbily edited). But given the fickleness of the Comic-Con generation Im sure theyre already thinking Whens the reboot?This story appeared in the July 30 2012 issue of New York Magazine.

By Anthony Lane Batman battles his most potent foe in Christopher Nolans film.   Credit Illustration by Martin Ansin With his new film ""The Dark Knight Rises"" Christopher Nolan completes the triptych that he started with ""Batman Begins"" (2005) and continued with ""The Dark Knight"" (2008). So now we have the full saga of our hero from childhood trauma to grand apotheosis. We see how Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) the compulsive loner and eccentric billionaire has transformed himself into Batman the scourge of evil and savior of Gotham City. At last we are able to grasp what links these two incarnations each it turns out is a pain in the neck. Be honest. How badly would you not want Bruce--or Batman--to show up at one of your parties? He has no small talk (and Bale as an actor has charisma but no charm) although ask him about fear anger and other large abstract nouns especially as they relate to him and hell keep you in the corner all night. He doesnt eat or drink besides toying with a flute of champagne. Basic human tasks are beyond his reach; direct Batman to the bathroom and it would take him twenty minutes of hydraulic shunting simply to unzip. On the rare occasions when Bruce fresh from his helicopter or his Lamborghini enters a reception with a girl or two on his arm he looks deeply uncomfortable and Nolan as if sharing that unease tends to hurry him through the moment. The point--and after three installments it seems a fatal one--is that the two halves of our hero form not a beguiling contrast but a dreary perfect match. Both as Wayne and as super-Wayne he seems indifferent as the films themselves are to the activities of little people and to the claims of the everyday preferring to semi-purse his lips as if preparing to whistle for an errant dog and stare pensively into the distance. Caped or uncaped the guy is a bore. He should have kids; that would pull him out of himself. Or else he should hang out with Iron Man and get wasted. He should have fun. The third film picks up where its predecessors left off the implication being that anyone unschooled in those two works is not worthy and not welcome. ""I knew Harvey Dent"" Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) says in the opening scene and if you murmur ""Harvey who?"" its time to bail. Harvey Dent in ""The Dark Knight"" was a good man turned bad the district attorney who cleaned up Gotham City but sullied his soul; Gordon is the good cop who stayed good his mustache and glasses like Grouchos unchanged with the passing years. Newcomers include Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) another pure policeman and Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard) a businesswoman with a past even more loaded than her wallet; regulars include Alfred (Michael Caine) the butler-cum-pedagogue who has always dwelt by Bruces side and Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) who does pretty much what Q does in the Bond movies except that he does it with the air of someone offering up pieces of the True Cross. To give credit where its due the spiffiness of the gadgets remains intact. We still have the Bat-Pod which looks like a motorbike crossed with a very angry praying mantis. Its near-spherical wheels spin on some complicated gimbal system allowing it to hang a sharp left without describing anything as tedious as a curve. Nothing was finer than its begetting in ""The Dark Knight"" when it burst forth from the body of the Tumbler Batmans four-wheeled vehicle of choice; the signature image of the trilogy best viewed from a low angle is of our guy crouched over his long machine his cloak streaming behind him as he powers through the night. This time he has an addition to his stable a flying craft with two enclosed rotors underneath which allow it to dink around tall buildings and presumably to chop vegetables in the event that Alfred wants to make a pot-au-feu. Visually the new toy is less striking than the Pod as you can tell from its unambitious name. ""I just took to calling it the Bat"" Lucius says. Not so fantastic Mr. Fox. Batman needs all the gizmos he can muster if he is to defeat his latest and most potent foe. Bane (Tom Hardy) is a muscleman who was we are told ""born and raised in Hell on earth"" which sounds like an unused lyric by Spinal Tap. Near the start he is sprung from an airplane in flight; later with the push of a button he sets off a train of explosions in the Gotham sewers leading to extravagant results on a football field. Both scenes have appeared in trailers which is a shame because a Nolan spectacle is nothing without its detonation of surprise; he is an instinctive showman who may be Kubrick-careful in his compositions but who harks back to De Mille in his unabashed devotion to the big event. When the edge of a city in ""Inception"" (2010) curled up and ascended to the vertical we goggled with joyous amazement like infants turning the page of a pop-up book. Conversely the earnest revelations allotted to Marion Cotillard in that movie seemed out of place undone by the curious rule that governs Nolans oeuvre the heavier the emotion the less it means to us. We go to his films to gasp not to yearn or pity or weep except over the paucity of our own automobiles. Who then in ""The Dark Knight Rises"" does the rising? Not Bruce; the slacker we see wandering through the Wayne mansion at the beginning can hardly get out of his pajamas. Carnally too he seems about as risen as flatbread; over three films we have waited for him to have Bat-core sex hanging upside down from a rafter and emitting cries of sonar and what has he given us? Not a squeak. There is one canoodle here in front of a homely hearth but its laughably chaste and our masochistic lover boy seems far more aroused by trading punches with Bane. We are left then with yeasty political risings a resentful mob summoned by Bane who instructs the downtrodden of Gotham to surge up against their overlords. Ahead of the movie the Web was alive with hints of topicality; nothing boosts a fan base like the possibility that its crazes and crushes might resound in the real world and Batman devotees were pre-congratulating Nolan for tapping into the spirit of Occupy. Sorry guys. It didnt work out. True we see a handful of rich white men being ejected from fancy apartments but then the film coughs politely and moves on as if recalling that nobody is richer or whiter than Bruce Wayne and that his apartment is in fact a castle. Also the outcome is positively Victorian in that its dread of disorder far outweighs its relish of liberty uncaged; the throng is faced down and tamed by ranks of growling police officers. Having just spent half the movie trapped underground between mounds of rubble they are in no mood to be messed with. I know how they feel. Something has happened here. ""The Dark Knight"" was pantherish and sleek. ""Inception"" had its faults but the frictionless ease with which it slipped from one reverie to the next kept it buoyant and alert; Nolan knew as Buster Keaton knew that moviegoers are paying dreamers even if Keaton also knew and proved in ""Sherlock Jr."" that dreams are more fragmentary than Nolan would admit. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" however is murky interminable confused and dropsical with self-importance. It is also inaudible. Batman speaks in his usual bronchial whisper and Bane wears a crablike mask over the lower part of his face--a disastrous burden for Tom Hardy whose mouth sensual and amused for such a tough customer is his defining feature. Via this device Bane declaims his bold anarchic sentiments; at least I think they were anarchic. Given that I could make out barely a third of them he may well have been reciting from ""Clifford the Small Red Puppy."" But the over-all sound balance in ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is so screwy that everyones dialogue not just Banes is forever being swallowed by ambient noise and I began to wonder if we were even meant to follow the labyrinth of the plot. And yet for all that the film is redeemed--rescued from itself ironically by another mouth. Rimmed in scarlet it belongs to Anne Hathaway. She plays Selina Kyle a Catwoman in the making though really just a jewel thief. Deft and purring she seems to pounce in from another land entirely a Hitchcockian pleasure ground of light fingers and matching repartee and her expression is that of a grown woman who surveys all these sombre boys plus their whizzing toys and sees only Bat-crap. When Bruce dances with her at a costume party the music behind them is Ravels ""Pavane for a Dead Princess"" which must be Nolans idea of a waltz; yet still she smiles. Her silver heels are like knives her working costume is tauter than a second skin and when she straddles the Pod as if planning to have kittens with it the only one not to notice is poor old Batman. What can you expect? This is a fellow whose permanent frown is ready-carved between the brows of his black rubber mask and who was warned by Alfred not to take up Gothams cause because ""there is nothing here for you but pain and tragedy."" Christopher Nolan for all his visionary flair wants to suck the comic out of comic books; Anne Hathaway wants to put it back in. Take your pick.

WB""The Batman"" Police Commissioner Gordon croaks weakly to Bruce Wayne early in The Dark Knight Rises ""must come back."" The commissioner frames the matter as a civic obligation though one imagines that Warner Bros. Pictures may have harbored motivations of a rather more commercial nature. In any case here we are with the third--and theoretically final--installment of writer/director Christopher Nolans take on the caped crusader. Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) makes his plea to Wayne (Christian Bale) after suffering multiple bullet perforations and a near-drowning at the hands of Bane (Tom Hardy) a seething mass of bicep and trapezius who is also unfortunately a terrorist mastermind. Bane is assembling an army in the sewers beneath Gotham City and the police commanded during Gordons recuperation by a fainthearted deputy (Matthew Modine) seem unequal to the gathering threat.Of the Batman films its the one in which Nolans ambitions have most clearly outstripped his results Its been eight years in movie time since the conclusion of the last film The Dark Knight when heroic-attorney-turned-sociopathic-killer Harvey Dent died in the midst of an altercation with Batman. The latter demanded to be held responsible for the formers crimes in order that Dent could remain a symbol of hope for the denizens of Gotham. And indeed the city subsequently used his memory to pass the Harvey Dent Act which granted the police extraordinary powers to combat organized crime. (The film toys with the idea that this may not have been a good thing to do but briefly and without much conviction.) As a result there has been relative peace in the city and Bruce Wayne has retired to his manor to live as a Howard Hughesian hermit. Batman has not been heard from at all. But you know how it is Just when you thought you were out they pull you back in. Soon enough Batman is onto the scent of Bane taking the occasional break to swap jabs jibes and a layer or so of lip gloss with cryptic cat burglar--yes this would be Catwoman but Nolan is sharp enough to skip the moniker--Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway). Selina warns Batman that Bane is too strong for him after his long layaway as does his loyal butler Alfred (Michael Caine). And sure enough they prove at least for a time to be correct.The Dark Knight Rises is two hours and 45 minutes long and its easy to consider it to be made up of two roughly equal halves--especially as there is a shocking incident at around the 80-minute mark which splits the movie in two almost literally. The first half of Nolans film is bold innovative and darkly thrilling. The opening sequence in particular is a tour de force an aerial extraction that puts The Dark Knights shanghaiing in Hong Kong to shame. And while the movies other big set pieces dont rise to the level of its predecessor its fight sequences are a considerable upgrade--vivid visceral and raw. The credit is owed primarily to Hardys Bane who while not quite so indelible a villain as Heath Ledgers Joker (how could he be?) is one several times the size. Hardy has been big in past roles--he gained more than 40 pounds of muscle for his breakthrough role in Nicolas Winding Refns Bronson--but here he is almost implausibly immense a mountain of flesh with a neck as thick as a normal persons waist. With his volcanic physique and a voice that booms metallically from behind a tube-crossed facemask Hardy commands nearly every scene he is in.Hathaway does about as well with the Selina Kyle role as one could reasonably hope and evinces surprising combat agility of her own. But the whole good/bad-girl role demands a tricky dance and one made no easier by a leather jumpsuit and goggles that flip up on top of her head like yes cat ears. Though she occasionally lets the hint of a purr escape her lips--dont do it Anne--she thankfully never goes the full Eartha Kitt. Oldman and Morgan Freeman (as Batmans avuncular weapons designer Lucius Fox) are customarily terrific and space is carved out nicely for Joseph Gordon-Levitt as an aggressive young cop. Bale is again solid as Bruce Wayne but even he looks as though hes tired of the breathy rasp hes required to adopt when he slips on cloak and cowl. And Marion Cotillard is largely wasted as a clean-energy philanthropist and possible love interest.Apart from Hardy its Caine who is the real standout among the cast offering a more melancholy turn on Alfred Pennyworth than in the earlier films. Particularly moving are the scenes in which he pleads--and ultimately does more than plead--with Wayne to understand that Bane is too powerful to tackle head-on. ""Youre not the Batman anymore"" he implores. ""You have to find another way.""There was an opportunity here for Nolan to show us that other way to (again) stretch the boundaries of what is possible in a superhero film. Instead alas the latter half of The Dark Knight Rises retreats toward conventionality and while perfectly fine on its own merits cant help but disappoint. As was the case with the previous two movies Nolan bites off a great deal but proceeds to chew somewhat less. MORE ON THE DARK KNIGHT RISES A Visual History of the Batcave Why Bat-Fans Are Rabid Pow How the Dark Knight Became Dark Again At the Summer Box Office a Battle in Filming Techniques Why Its Good That Nolan and Batman are Finished Is Batman the Last Gasp of the Film-Trilogy Format? Christopher Nolan Should Break Batman Its a common trap for sequels to be handcuffed by nostalgia and the desire to tie up loose ends. One of the strengths of the previous film The Dark Knight was that it broke free abandoning the airy mysticism of Batman Begins for something bleaker and grittier positioning itself as a kind of gangland neo-noir. But The Dark Knight Rises instead harkens back to the first film to Ras al Ghul and the League of Shadows to slender overwrought meditations on the nature of fear and the soul. And while some of the backward references--to Martha Waynes pearls for instance--are touching they ultimately become wearisome. Three flashbacks to Batman Begins are at least one too many. There are more particular missteps as well. An oddly off-key Occupy-Wall-Street-inspired political undercurrent suggests that a substantial population of ordinary Gothamites would be so dissatisfied with their civic institutions that they would join Bane--who has by this time done some decidedly terrible things--in a violent insurrection against the citys wealthy elites. (Yes this is an anti-Bain Bane.) And one characters recovery from a rather crucial impairment defies pretty much everything that I believe is known of human physiology.Is this setting too high a bar for what is after all a superhero movie? One can surely make the case. But its Nolan himself who put the bar up there. Moreover its hard to escape the sense that that a movie as self-serious as this one--it is even more grandiose than the The Dark Knight--ought to display a little more well seriousness.The Dark Knight Rises is a good movie and at times a very good one complex intense and sharply executed. But of the Batman films it is the one in which Nolans ambitions have most clearly outstripped his results. Last time out he reinvented the superhero genre. This time--even at his best--he is merely recycling it.

Continue Reading Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics. Continue Reading daily sunny/Flickr What an Introvert Sounds Like Olga Khazan The World Well-Being Project uses Facebook updates to correlate language with personality traits. Do our Facebook posts reflect our true personalities? Incrementally probably not. But in aggregate the things we say on social media paint a fairly accurate portrait of our inner selves. A team of University of Pennsylvania scientists is using Facebook status updates to find commonalities in the words used by different ages genders and even psyches. The so-called ""World Well-Being Project"" started as an effort to gauge happiness across various states and communities. ""Governments have an increased interest in measuring not just economic outcomes but other aspects of well-being"" said Andrew Schwartz a UPenn computer scientist who works on the project. ""But its very difficult to study well-being at a large scale. It costs a lot of money to administer surveys to see how people are doing in certain areas. Social media can help with that.""

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

By Peter Rainer Film critic July 20 2012 Save for later Saved The Dark Knight Rises actor Tom Hardy portrays Bane Batmans new nemesis. Ron Phillips/Warner Bros. Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" doesnt really rise to the occasion. This concluding movie in the ""Batman"" trilogy isnt just dark its pitch black. Director Christopher Nolan has literally gone over to the dark side.Of course ""The Dark Knight"" which I admired was similarly hued; but that film had a grandeur a tragic sense that ""Rises"" lacks. It also had Heath Ledgers Joker whereas ""Rises"" has as Batmans chief nemesis a brawny mercenary named Bane played by Tom Hardy in a face mask with a breathing device conveniently attached. Please note Thats spelled B-a-n-e not B-a-i-n.One of the reasons why nemeses are so important in the ""Batman"" series is because Batman himself at least as played by Christian Bale is not terribly galvanizing. In ""Rises"" which begins eight years after ""The Dark Knight"" Batman is no longer around and Bruce Wayne is in seclusion. Gotham City is relatively crime-free although all that is about to change when Bane hulks onto the scene. Recommended Think youre a film buff? Take our movie trivia quiz What follows is an extended sadomasochistic scenario in which Batman is clobbered within an inch of his life before coming around. Ive always been partial to Batman as a superhero because in fact he has no superpowers. Hes an enhanced Everyman. But watching what happens to him in ""Rises"" made me wish he had something extra-human going on. Test your knowledge Think youre a film buff? Take our movie trivia quiz Video The Dark Knight Rises trailer Monitor Movie Guide Theres a punitive depressive edge to this film that isnt fully warranted by its story - which for all its pretensions is a fairly conventional extension of the franchise. Were it not for Anne Hathaways Catwoman-ish Selina Kyle there wouldnt be a single character in ""Rises"" who cracks a smile. Im not arguing that ""Rises"" should be ""Singin in the Rain."" But its Wagnerian ambitions are not matched by its material. It hasnt earned its darkness. Grade C+ (Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action some sensuality and language.)

No way thats happening in this last installment. A comic-book tale that has gotten darker than anyone thought possible is now careening toward a burst of light -- possibly a nuclear blast -- at the end of the tunnel. Christopher Nolans Dark Knight trilogy has always focused on the psychology of evil and this time the director is looking more at evils sociological implications. Bat gizmos or no this new movie has both feet planted firmly in the real world. Whats your poison? Terrorists? Wall Street shenanigans? Government incompetence? Nolans got you covered. This films bad guy trained in a Middle East hellhole conspires with stock manipulators and exploits the mother of all police cover-ups. Are you troubled by the social inequality making political headlines? Studio heads may identify with billionaire Bruce Wayne but Nolan knows there are more moviegoers in the 99 percent. ""Theres a storm coming Mr. Wayne"" whispers Ann Hathaways cat burglar. ""You and your friends better batten down the hatches cause when it hits youre all gonna wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little for the rest of us."" i Selina Kyle aka Catwoman (Anne Hathaway) is one of the characters proficient in Occupy-style talking points in The Dark Knight Rises. Ron Phillips/Warner Bros. Pictures hide caption toggle caption Ron Phillips/Warner Bros. Pictures Selina Kyle aka Catwoman (Anne Hathaway) is one of the characters proficient in Occupy-style talking points in The Dark Knight Rises. Ron Phillips/Warner Bros. Pictures Take Two David Edelsteins Fresh Air review Movie Reviews As Class Warfare Brews A Dark Knight Rises Shes not the only one who has mastered messaging. Bad guy Bane -- the bane of all our existence as played by Tom Hardy in a mouth guard thatll give fanboys orthodontist nightmares -- has his anti-government rhetoric down so pat he can make a new Bastille Day sound vaguely reasonable. And his diabolical plans for Gotham mix other specifically Dickensian horrors with modernist ones peoples courts straight out of A Tale of Two Cities a surveillance society on steroids even underground tremors that will stoke fracking fears. All of it set not in the stylized Gotham of the previous movies but in a gritty post-Sept. 11 Manhattan complete with a still-under-construction tower at Ground Zero. Quite a setting for super-sized superheroics. I saw the film in 35 millimeter and did not feel deprived though Ill certainly be heading back to catch it in IMAX at some point. Even without an image five stories tall the spectacle is considerable pumped up by a Hans Zimmer score so thundering that it pretty much drowns out the dialogue in some spots. And if a couple of Morgan Freemans bat-gizmos seem sort of standard-issue -- a big-wheeled bat-cycle for instance thats not very interesting until it corners -- he and the rest of the characters keep things plenty compelling whether theyre old friends like Michael Caines protective butler Alfred or new ones like Joseph Gordon-Levitts earnest police officer. As you might expect from the creator of Inception and Memento there are surprises both in the story and in the storytelling. But the biggest surprise may just be how satisfying Nolan has made his farewell to a Dark Knight trilogy that many fans will wish hed extend to a 10-part series at least.

Find out whats happening in the world as it unfolds.""The Dark Knight Rises"" pits Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman against Tom Hardy as Bane.Story highlights""The Dark Knight Rises"" is the final installment in Christopher Nolans Batman trilogyThe action takes place years after Batman has disappeared from GothamThe film is relatively short on action and excitement says reviewer Tom CharityHe is risenYou must have heard Batman is back and the trilogy Christopher Nolan promised moviegoers is fulfilled with ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Fans have been clamoring for it; the media are all over it; a record-breaking opening week is practically guaranteed. I only wish I could say I enjoyed this big sprawling beast of a movie. Dont get me wrong -- I think Nolan is one of Hollywoods best and brightest and the previous two Batman films set a high bar. In an era dominated by spectacle fantasy and escapism when apparently all the audience really wants or needs is the excuse to switch off and chill out ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"" supplied all that and still somehow reflected the anxieties and tensions of America in the post 9/11 world. No other blockbusters have been so overtly fixated on terrorism -- wanton destruction for destructions sake -- and the price to be paid for responding in kind. If fans care more passionately about ""The Dark Knight"" than the more lighthearted and frankly enjoyable Marvel movies its surely because theres more here than meets the eye. The 9/11 subtext is more explicit than ever here with masked bogeyman Bane (Tom Hardy) wreaking havoc on the Stock Exchange and threatening to blow Gotham sky-high. He may not wear the beard of the jihadist but the (literal) hellhole he comes from sure looks like it belongs in Afghanistan. And while he speaks via a voice box in a plumy English accent that might be an imitation of Sir Ian McKellen doing Patrick Stewart his revolutionary rhetoric echoes nihilistic terrorists. If Bane has a goal its to bomb Gotham back to year zero.This is eight years after Bruce Wayne has lost his beloved Rachel and Batman disappeared from view taking the rap for killing civic hero Harvey Dent. Wayne is a recluse somewhere between Jay Gatsby and Howard Hughes in the public imagination never venturing out into the world until cat burglar Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) picks his lock and piques his fancy. Shes no Joker (who is?) but Hathaways slinky light-fingered high-kicking thief is the films best idea of fun even if shes also weighed down with the Nolan brothers irrepressible urge to smuggle topical half-baked Occupy sermons into the script (as others have noted the movies defense of the establishment in the form of philanthropic billionaires and an incorruptible police force gives it a conservative gloss and makes you wonder what on earth Nolan saw in the two films hes cited as inspirations ""The Battle of Algiers"" and ""Prince of the City""). Share your review of Dark Knight Rises scenes from midnight screeningsAt any rate its a pity she disappears from the action for lengthy stretches because Selina seems like a worthy fencing partner for Bruce more so than the brawny sewer rat Bane one of those arch-criminal masterminds who never know when to stop yakking and pull the trigger. That goes for the movie as a whole which at 164 minutes is long on lugubrious soul-searching and relatively short on action and excitement. Thats too harsh Im sure and I will rush to acknowledge that the first set piece a midair hijacking is audacious and original. A lot of what follows is at least slick and expensive and the killing field you will have glimpsed in the trailers is simply breathtaking. You cant fault the film for lacking grandiosity and scale or its own dogged brand of designer despair. But Nolan bites off more than even he can chew in the movies wildly overambitious and borderline nonsensical third act. Hes always been adept at structure so its dismaying how often Nolan falls back on crude parallel editing and flashbacks how loosely he plays with space and time in a climax that rings more than a little hollow in its efforts to circle back to ""Batman Begins.""Others will see it differently but for me this is a disappointingly clunky and bombastic conclusion to a superior series -- Nolans biggest and worst movie to date.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post The subject was always heroism. No not the superheroism of so many comic-book adaptations -- or caped-crusading heroism solely -- but the individual and communal gumption required to face down evil. Or at least give it your best try. The heroic is what Christopher Nolans rebooted Batman franchise has explored with a slow-burning often brilliant intensity since 2005s ""Batman Begins"" introduced us to a not particularly warm crime fighter named Bruce Wayne. Much of the franchises simmer has come by way of star Christian Bale as Wayne the billionaire orphan whose icy facade disguised a roiling anger. Yes hes a playboy an industrialist but Bruce Wayne is no Tony Stark. From the moment ""The Dark Knight Rises"" opens it is visually bold and masterfully paced. Sure it clocks in at Nolans preferred 2 1/2 hour runtime but the wildly choreographed action set-pieces are punctuated with character revealing pauses. The director and cowriter/brother Jonathan Nolan pay heed to Waynes wounded emotional arc. And the film is a feat of painstakingly crafted closure. Although Nolan knows that ""closure"" is a provisional notion. The final chapter arrives with a new nemesis named Bane a new frenemy in Selina Kyle/Catwoman and a slew of nagging questions about how to rise to the task of the hero in the face of villainy of evil. Marion Cotillard who had a pivotal role in Nolans ""Inception"" plays Waynes corporate ally Miranda Tate. She wants the businessman to use his resources to better the world. Another ""Inception"" alum Joseph Gordon-Levitt portrays police officer John Blake who believes in Batman when other cops are trying to bring him down. ""Dark Knight Rises"" doesnt just ponder the heroic it serves as a reminder that celebrating false heroes seldom turns out well. Its been eight years since Bruce Wayne became a recluse and as many years since Batman was last seen. In those years Wayne and Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) have allowed the good people of Gotham to believe deceased D.A. Harvey Dent/Two-Face was a hero and that Batman was his killer. The lie worked for a time. The city was free from organized crime. Banes arrival changes this. Hobbled physically and emotionally Wayne will have to stir from his sour mood his grief over the loss of Rachel Dawes in ""The Dark Knight"" and leave his cave of sorrow. Hes roused from his stupor by an unlikely person. Anne Hathaway portrays Selina Kyle/Catwoman a cynical and gifted cat burglar. Not only is Selina clad in the films hottest couture (a wide brim hat hints at Audrey Hepburn)  shes accessorized with the movies finest quips often delivered with an insouciant evenness. Look up ""Bane"" and youll find ""slayer"" ""poison"" ""woe"" ""destruction."" Tom Hardys character is all that and more. He wears a mask over his mouth that looks like the muzzle needed for a dangerous dog. Beckoned to Gotham by Wayne Industries board member Roland Daggett (Ben Mendelsohn) he has grander schemes. Hes amassing a muscular army seemingly fueled by class resentment for his purposes. Is he the revolutionary he presents himself as or an anarchist exploiter of economic disparity? Occasionally Hardys dialog gets muffled in that mask. Yes you get his gist but when he issues an ultimatum it would be nice to hear it. ""What did he just say? How much time before the bomb is detonated?"" are not the questions you want to be whispering in the pitch of battle. In a film of such impeccable craft its a minor blemish. Waynes gentlemen support team remains in place. Michael Caine returns as Alfred. The Wayne family butler continues to see his role in Bruces life as one of moving his ward toward a more human dare he hope happy existence. As Lucius Fox the billionaires right-hand man at Wayne Enterprises Morgan Freeman comes bearing bad news (youre broke) and gifts (a flying machine called ""the Bat""). Rated PG-13 ""The Dark Knight Rises"" requires the same caveats as its immediate predecessor Violent intent and scenes of wholesale destruction are rendered expertly enough that parents may not want to burden their young kids with them. For all the uncanny rabid splendor Heath Ledger achieved in ""The Dark Knight"" as the Joker it was another scene that rattled our sense of heroic to its very core. The Joker had wired two ferries to blow. One was full of jump-suited prisoners. The other was packed with frightened commuters. Each ships passengers had been given the detonator to the explosives on the other boat. Whod push the button first? It remains the franchises signature moment the place where moviegoers can most realistically enter the fray and decide what theyre made of. Bane must have consulted with the Joker because a trigger and a bomb -- a much bigger bomb -- figure into this saga too. And there are many more moments for people not wearing masks to pick up the gauntlet of an ethical challenge. If all this sounds a bit weighty for what one might want to shrug off as just a movie and a tentpole one at that it is. Christoper Nolan continues to prove himself a serious moviemaker with superlative skills and a fondness for ""intelligent escapism"" as one Brit wrote in the highfalutin movie mag ""Sight amp; Sound."" Yes ""The Dark Knight Rises"" engrosses and thrills. So much so we might feel weve taken leave for a brief spell of our world of conflict and contention. Yet we havent or not exactly. Nolan and his dynamic cast and crew have delivered a movie that recasts daily tensions on an epic pop-culture scale. Still the finales nudge is unmistakable Go out from your muliplex cocoon leave your IMAX cave and a be prepared to be a hero.

The acting writing directing etc are out of this world. On top of that the movie is like Shakespearian plays - it has action sequences to appeal to the masses while also appealing to the intellectuals. I also suspect some of the criticism comes from far left Che t shirt wearing sympathizers who did not appreciate having Bolshevik style rhetoric and ""courts"" displayed as they happened. Or demonstrating how those famous figures used rhetoric and the political process for the useful idiots to conceal their true purposes. Am I the only one who noticed the clear homage to Dr Zhivago in one of the scenes? The Dent Act was clearly like a combo of the patriot act and the ndaa and that cant please either Obama or Bush partisans. So many amazing philosophical questions as well like conquering fear and the danger of having none. The more I watch this movie the more impressed I am with it. In twenty years time I believe this movie will be looked at in the same way that today we look at Apocalypse Now. It is without a doubt the best trilogy ever - what even comes close? No other movie franchise was any good after the first or second movie except for this one. PS Roeper - I loved it when you came on Artie Langes show Bruce Piercesaid on Saturday February 02 2013 50218 PMThis movie was no fun at all. Nasty from beginning to end and this review from the same guy that trashed The Hobbit. Crazy Daveysaid on Sunday September 02 2012 114901 AMthinking about it some more... I feel bad for the director thats going to take up the Batman franchise after Nolan. So much to live up to Mariemsaid on Tuesday August 14 2012 53012 PMA lot of the acting in this movie was great. Morgan Freeman Gary Oldman Nestor Carbonell Anthony Michael Hall Melinda McGraw all did good work as theyve done in the past and there are donzes more actors that one recognizes from other things.But youre right this was a great story full of ambiguous choices for many characters. Reminded me a bit of The Departed in that respect. The story was what made all the characters amazing and the acting look so good. Any actor can chew scenery but it was the plot that made Ledgers Joker a hundred times scarier than Nicholsons; I appreciated that this wasnt the Jokers story it really was Batmans unlike the Keaton version. The directing was very good and the special effects almost didnt get in the way of the plot.Im going to have to go once more just to get nuances I may have missed the first time. (Plus its on IMAX.) Johnsaid on Sunday August 05 2012 74800 AMWhen you first joined up with Roger Ebert it was obvious that you had no idea what you were doing as a film critic. This review only confirms that fact.

Christian Bale provides the perfect progression of emotional and physical frailty to wearing his signature cape crusader suit with all that is necessary to be Gothams dark knight. Morgan Freeman Gary Oldman Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Marion Cotillard are all strong presences but Michael Caine brings the most noteworthy earnest heart wrenching speeches that can render one to the point of tears. It is this great character-driven work that makes this final installment a masterpiece. In all honesty my greatest skepticism was focused on Anne Hathaways Selina Kyle a.k.a ""Catwoman"" for the reasons that her natural mannerisms and way of speaking convey too much of the American sweetheart vibe rather than the slinky corporeally sensual characteristics required for the role. To my complete and utter delight I am far too happy to report that I was entirely wrong. Hathaways raspy Hedy Lamarr-inspired vocals are every bit as seductive as her predecessors purring and hisses her lines as only a true vixen could. Following Heath Ledgers renowned portrayal as the callously charismatic Joker Tom Hardy certainly had some massive shoes to fill playing Bane. Youd think expressionism wouldnt be on his side but the menacing metal mask laced with valves engulfing the bottom half of his face could not impede the intensive magnetism of Hardys eyes. Terffic performance. The direction cinematography writing and imagery all concoct the ideal recipe for an astonishing movie but it does still fall short of living up to ""The Dark Knight."" Only by a fraction or two. One gripe with ""Rises"" is concerning Batmans new flying contraption known as the Bat-Wing. Films creator Christopher Nolan had kept Bruce Waynes gadgets and vehicles as believable as possible in order to retain the elements of realism throughout the franchise until the hydraulics mounted aircraft came roaring onto screen. Yes it is a staple with Batman but its plausibility stretches itself a little thin in comparison to the more practical Batmobile. Its rendition looks as if Lucas Fox had stolen a peek at Tony Starks blueprints for a redesigned X-Men Blackbird. Also the absence of Chicagos rich and original visuals are deeply missed. Not only because it made the perfect backdrop in cinematography for the previous films but because everything about Nolans reinvented Gotham is rather cold. ""Rises"" does take place eight years after ""The Dark Knight"" conclusion but that shouldnt mean that the city should be unrecognizable. It doesnt feel like Gotham but more like Bruce Wayne and company moved his manor and bat cave elsewhere to another metropolis. These spats aside I would give ""The Dark Knight Rises"" a solid ""A."" Quentinsaid on Wednesday August 01 2012 94405 PMThank you for the clear-headed synopsis insight and review of the movie. Billsaid on Tuesday July 31 2012 54546 PMRichard - Great review. I agree completely. What a marvelous movie Crazy Daveysaid on Tuesday July 31 2012 10716 PMLoved this film. I have to agree it is one of the best movie trilogies of all time.

See what the critics are saying about The Dark Knight Rises See 13 awesome photos from The Dark Knight Rises Christopher Nolan has a lot to say in his final Batman movie enough to fill 164 minutes. Yes The Dark Knight Rises. And rises. And rises some more.No moral implication is left unexamined no stunt left unperformed in this weighty behemoth of a superhero coda. The plotting is dense the consequences severe. It makes The Dark Knight look like a Saturday-morning cartoon.Everything is bigger in Rises including the villain a hulking methodical sociopath named Bane (Tom Hardy unrecognizable behind a mask that covers his mouth and nose). Bane considers himself Gothams reckoning; we know this because he tells us. Hes enough to draw Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) out of retirement and back into the bat suit and push this genre-shattering trilogy to its conclusion trial by grim trial.From its opening sequence a ridiculous and thrilling midair heist that gives Nolan a route back into the gravity-defying high jinks of Inception The Dark Knight Rises throws you into the middle of the action and asks you to sink or swim.If youve kept up with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight the first two movies of the trilogy youll be on fairly sure footing. If you havent take a map and a prayer. Watching The Dark Knight Rises can be a little like landing in the middle of The Wire on HBO or a Russian novel.Or perhaps a 250 million study of the French Revolution. Banes endgame is to finish the work of the League of Shadows and bring Gotham to its knees. A plaintive politician might call his method class warfare Unchain the 1 percent -- in this case the incarcerated locked up by the late district attorney Harvey Dent in The Dark Knight -- and destroy civilization as we know it. Hardys Bane is the malignant heart of the movie a fitting distillation of dread and evil for the Dark Knights grand finale.Youll find a few lighter touches here including Anne Hathaway silky smooth and understated as a Catwoman intent on redistributing the wealth. But on the whole youll never see a superhero movie that takes itself so seriously. Thats not necessarily a bad thing; Nolans audacity and his respect for his audiences intelligence are welcome antidotes in a summer larded with disposable Hollywood product.The Dark Knight Rises could benefit from a judicious trim here and there a little more momentum to help carry the considerable weight. But its visually enthralling especially the scenes of urban chaos that call to mind Fritz Langs Metropolis. The level of craft as on all Nolan productions is towering.Nolans Batman movies make for a fascinating balance between fantasy and grit careful characterization and epic scale. Its actually jarring when they traffic in the stuff of standard summer action movies -- the endless action finale for instance. But even that works on a higher level (no spoilers) that wraps up the trilogy with satisfying flair.Theres a lot of movie here and a sense of finality that speaks to the trilogys ambitions. The Dark Knight Rises will inspire many a socioeconomic academic treatise. Its a rare Hollywood beast and a Nolan specialty the summer blockbuster that doesnt ask you to check your brain at the door.Follow Chris Vognar on Twitter at chrisvognar.THE DARK KNIGHT RISESB+ Directed by Christopher Nolan.

Right from the start its apparent that Nolan knows where the good stuff will be mined big IMAX action scenes juxtaposed with intimate moments of dialogue. There are moments of real brilliance here akin to ""Inception"" ""Memento"" and ""The Dark Knight"" - even if there are momentary lapses in the plot structure. Though it ends up being much more of the film we want as opposed to the film we need it does indeed end the modern ""Batman"" franchise with a blustery bang. Yep you should see ""The Dark Knight Rises"" at your earliest opportunity its a real doozy. To encapsulate the plot would take (at least) a full graphic novel so well just hit the high notes. Weve got a new villain about town his name is Bane and he comes equipped with impressive headgear. A lengthy origin story is considered throughout but Bane is fairly easy to ""figure out"" hes a stone cold killer with fire in his eyes. Back in Gotham almost a decade has passed since Harvey Dents big night out Batman has been in exile and along with him his billionaire alter-ego Bruce Wayne. Will Banes destructive and destabilizing methods bring Bats out of his seclusion? Well yeah most likely especially given the name of the film. Throw in a a bit of Catwoman and youve got a fairly good idea of what youre in for and all of it presented in blessed 2-D Where ""The Dark Knight Rises"" feels a bit like ""The Dark Knight"" is in the broad tackling of relevant social issues. If you cede that ""The Dark Knight"" considered terrorist extremism and surveillance methods then its apparent ""The Dark Knight Rises"" isnt thrilled with the current power structure of capitalism. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" casts a withering eye toward the one percent with Catwoman at one point purring ""You think this can last? How did you think you could live so large and leave so little for the rest of us?"" Mention is made of ""standing on the shoulders of people with less"" and theres also a scene involving Wall St. traders that exposes the ugly truths behind rampant profiteering ... right before showing the ugly truth behind a rampant Bane. Nolans message is clear to anyone who wants to listen though the analogy isnt nearly as fluid as Heath Ledgers Joker / terrorism construct Bane does ask many interesting questions though hes also routinely exposed as a bully. Still Nolans message to the elite is clear - you can only push the little guy down for so long and we must all row together if were to reap the benefits of a free society. So far as the performances are concerned Anne Hathaway doesnt have the bristling insanity that Michelle Pfeiffer brought to the role but shes got something more steady and vital going for her. Hathaways Catwoman is struggling to survive searching for a clean slate unwilling to trust friend and foe alike. She pulls it off. The same can be said for previous Nolan stalwarts Marion Cottilard and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Both acquit themselves well handling the heavy dramatic lifting a film as giant as ""The Dark Knight Rises"" demands. Returnees Christian Bale Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman give their normal excellent performances and Michael Caine does his best work of the series. Unfortunately for all the smooth operating and global issues tackled ""The Dark Knight Rises"" struggles in a few areas too. For the first time in the entire series a ""race against the clock"" aspect is overtly used more befitting of a lesser movie such as ""Amazing Spider-Man."" Banes audio still has massive problems though its clear most of it was handled in post-production. While (somewhat) clear its jarring to hear Bane talk because he sounds as if hes being beamed in from Planet Mars. Hes not on the same audio level as any other character but I suppose thats what you get for throwing a mask on him. This mask also largely wastes Tom Hardys considerable skills obscuring his face to the point where hes acting only with his eyes. Lastly this is the first of the new series that has legitimate length issues. Where ""Batman Begins"" opened the new series with efficiency and ""The Dark Knight"" somehow kept on trucking throughout the 153-minute running time ""The Dark Knights Rises"" doesnt feel nearly as taut. 165 minutes is just too much time for ""The Dark Knight Rises"" to carry and there are entire scenes that dont really add up or instead offer awkward editing (as opposed to plot clarity). Still these are higher level problems to have and ""The Dark Knight Rises"" doesnt suffer any one issue for long enough to derail the enterprise as a whole. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" excels on a number of fronts as well. No franchise has done a better job at framing up huge action scenes and the characters are believable throughout - no small feat for a ""comic book"" movie. I suppose the amazing thing is that Christopher Nolans ""Batman"" franchise transcended the ""comic book"" genre long ago and these films are judged against peers featuring ""Best Picture"" marketing campaigns. Here now in the year 2012 we place ""The Dark Knight Rises"" aside FDR biopics and Paul Thomas Anderson films because Nolan has forever elevated the genre leaving all the other hero mythologies in the dust. The ""Batman"" franchise is thoroughly modern endeavor holding a mirror up to our society in a way that most films dont have nearly the ambition to even try. Should we consider clean energy in the ""Batman"" finale? Sure no problem. Class warfare? Yep you betcha Batmans sturdy shoulders are a platform for whatever Nolan wants to bring up because theres profound affinity for the main characters. No ""The Dark Knight Rises"" isnt a perfect film but it exists in a perfectly balanced imagination - one where Bane and Batman wage war for our immortal souls toe to toe slightly off-kilter each striving for that perfect balance from which to strike.

Warner Bros. Pictures Christian Bale in ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Warner Bros. Pictures photo Warner Bros. Pictures Christian Bale in ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Warner Bros. Pictures photo Spoiler alert ""The Dark Knight Rises"" will earn a billion dollars be the subject of more masters theses than ""Citizen Kane"" and get nominated for the Academy Award as best picture.It deserves at least two out of those three honors.The conclusion of Christopher Nolans superhero trilogy is a hugely ambitious mix of eye candy and brain food. If it doesnt have the haunting aftertaste of the previous serving thats only because Nolan couldnt clone Heath Ledger. But beefy substitute Tom Hardy is a hell of a villain. Hardy plays Bane a denizen of the underworld whose mechanized mouthpiece is the inverse of Batmans eye-covering cowl. Bane and his scruffy minions storm fortified Gotham City starting with a shocking shootout at the stock exchange to lure the caped crusader from his cave. But Batman aka billionaire Bruce Wayne (aka Christian Bale) has been hiding in his mansion for eight years because his vigilante tactics got perverted by the police state.Truth be told brooding Bruce Wayne has been the weakest thing about the Batman movies; but this installment gives him a lively love interest -- Catwoman (Anne Hathaway) a gymnastic jewel thief who penetrates his inner sanctum -- to complement the menacing Bane.After Wayne is awakened from his angst by conscientious cop John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) Catwoman arranges a meeting between Batman and Bane that leaves our hero trapped in a catacomb for a long stretch of the movie. But Bane supplies the spectacle for which this flick will be remembered. A scene in which he implodes a football stadium and incites the citizens to riot against the rich is 9/11 squared and the subsequent reign of terror raises timely questions about class struggle. Nolans nihilistic script which he co-wrote with his brother Jonathan seems to answer those questions with cannon fire. Batman has the baddest toys if not the best argument. The finale of the film with wealthy do-gooder Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard) caught in the crossfire gives us one astonishing image after another.We can mail this movie several Oscars for technical excellence and already theres a stealth campaign to crown it with the ultimate honor. But while the film will lure a lucrative demographic into the scared cave of cinema the effect is more experiential than emotional. Nolan like Bane believes we want cool chaos as much as we want a warm-blooded hero.

No one (or almost no one) has ever made it out alive the other prisoners report. In fact weve already been told that the shaft and its promise of freedom are there only to offer the prisoners in the pit some delusional hope much as some Christian doctrines hold that the damned souls in hell can see Paradise but can never get there.At about the same time back in Bruce Waynes hometown of Gotham -- which more closely resembles New York than it has before in this trilogy -- the city has fallen under the rule of a tyrannical revolutionary regime closely modeled on the French Revolutions Reign of Terror. All bridges that connect the island city to the outside world have been dynamited save one a tightly policed Checkpoint Charlie where emergency supplies are allowed to enter but nothing can leave. Those prosecuted as traitors to the revolution in kangaroo courts out of ""Through the Looking-Glass"" (""Sentence first -- verdict afterwards"") are offered the choice of death or exile which come to the same thing. Either sentence is imposed by forcing the renegade out onto the cracking winter ice that surrounds the city and watching him try to totter and slide across to the safety of normal non-revolutionary America. No one ever makes it.Im trying to make a number of points at once about ""The Dark Knight Rises"" but I cant help being distracted for a second by the fact that no living New Yorkers in all likelihood can remember significant winter ice on the Hudson or East rivers (which was relatively common in the 19th century). I honestly dont know whether Nolan is some kind of furious right-winger and I also dont think its an especially important question but in his Batman universe global warming seems to be a myth. Of course the ice around Gotham like that prison shaft serves an allegorical as well as a narrative function. Im tempted to argue that the real story of Nolans ""Dark Knight"" trilogy is the story of its own creation a dark personal auteurist spectacle on a scale never before possible and never before attempted and an enormously successful mass-market entertainment to boot. If the central theme of these movies is the triumph of the will (to coin a phrase) then that triumph is not Batmans or Bruce Waynes but that of solitary and devious superhero/supervillain Chris Nolan as he imposes his bizarre obsessions on the entire world.Lets back up for a minute and observe that all this stuff -- the French Revolution and the Middle Eastern pit-prison and the vision of Americas greatest city capitulating to the ugliest kind of anarchy and terror -- happens in a Batman movie. There are all kinds of valid reasons not to like ""The Dark Knight Rises"" which absolutely does not offer the summery pure-popcorn pleasure of something like Joss Whedons ""The Avengers."" Its loud and bombastic and exceptionally long -- 164 minutes from opening to closing credits -- and brutal in several senses of the word taking sadistic pleasure in both its scenes of violence and its Camus-meets-Nietzsche existential nihilism. It has no villain with even half the charisma of Heath Ledgers now-legendary Joker since Tom Hardys monstrous roided-out Bane remains figuratively and literally a masked figure behind his Hannibal Lecter-as-Darth Vader faceplate.As Ive suggested I think its a trap to read too much into this movie by way of political commentary but whatever you come away with it wont be uplifting. The Gotham status quo is a cynical regime based on ""useful lies"" false heroes and systemic inequality -- straight out of the playbook of neocon founding father Leo Strauss -- that corrupts even decent men like Gary Oldmans Commissioner Gordon. But the so-called revolution that overthrows it overseen by the forbidding mercenary Bane (who is himself just the mouthpiece for a sinister hidden agenda or several at once) is an Orwellian nightmare of atavism unreason and anarchy.Its no exaggeration to say that the ""Dark Knight"" universe is fascistic (and Im not name-calling or claiming that Nolan has Nazi sympathies). Its simply a fact. Nolans screenplay (co-written with his brother Jonathan Nolan and based on a story developed with David S. Goyer) simply pushes the Batman legend to its logical extreme as a vision of human history understood as a struggle between superior individual wills a tale of symbolic heroism and sacrifice set against the hopeless corruption of society. Maybe its an oversimplification to say that thats the purest form of the ideology that was bequeathed from Richard Wagner to Nietzsche to Adolf Hitler but not by much. Whether you think Nolan is endorsing or condemning that idea or straddling the fence with a smirk on his face is very much up to you.But if ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a fascist film its a great fascist film and arguably the biggest darkest most thrilling and disturbing and utterly balls-out spectacle ever created for the screen. Its an unfriendly masterpiece that shows you only a little circle of daylight way up there at the top of our collective prison shaft -- but a masterpiece nonetheless. Fighting against the tendency toward exhaustion in the final chapter of any entertainment franchise Nolan cinematographer Wally Pfister editor Lee Smith production designers Nathan Crowley and Kevin Kavanaugh and their enormous team have done grandiose and magnificent work spinning this operatic saga of a great city brought to its knees and an idol smashed. You Might Also Like Ive had mixed feelings about Christian Bales stony underplayed performance as Batman and Bruce Wayne throughout this series but it pays off here with his portrayal of an aging ailing superhero -- demonized for crimes he did not commit -- who comes out of retirement Michael Caines loyal Alfred suggests because he yearns to be destroyed. Alfred further says he thought it was a mistake for Bruce to return to Gotham from his youthful wanderings and don the Bat-cape in the first place ""I always knew there was nothing here for you but pain and tragedy."" Setting aside Hardys impressive but limited Bane this movie has the best acting of the series with brooding turns from Oldman (who spends much of the film in a hospital bed) the noticeably older Caine and Morgan Freeman and the reliably terrific Joseph Gordon-Levitt as an idealistic young cop with a childhood connection to the Batman. (Longtime DC Comics buffs already know where his character is headed.)Bruce now knows the truth about Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes in ""Batman Begins"" and Maggie Gyllenhaal in ""The Dark Knight"") his longtime love who had chosen to marry crusading D.A. Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) before both of them died at the end of ""The Dark Knight."" Do-gooder socialite Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard also the mysterious muse in Nolans ""Inception"") has designs on both Bruces corporation and his irresistibly battered bod but its mischievous cat burglar Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) who gets his attention. Male-female romance has never been Nolans strong suit still less sexuality but Hathaways delectable and treacherous character adds a welcome dash of Eros (and just the tiniest echo of the 1960s Adam West TV series). Selina is never described herein as Catwoman by the way although a glimpsed newspaper headline alludes to that possible monicker.But its the fearsome Bane and the non-metaphorical underground army he has assembled in the sewers of Gotham that compel Batmans return. Again I would argue that Nolan is mostly being provocative with this tale of underclass resentment of an uprising by the lower half of the 99 percent that is turned to evil purposes. If so it works. In its tremendous almost apocalyptic action sequences ""The Dark Knight Rises"" suggests a reverse-engineered version of a Soviet-era revolutionary epic in which the masses are the villains and their onetime overlords the heroes. Banes attack on a football stadium right after kickoff concludes a simultaneously brutal and elegant sequence set against an angelic boy singing the national anthem thats worthy of Martin Scorsese at his best. When Bane seizes control of Gotham he claims to be acting in the name of the people literally imprisoning the police and opening the prisons but his method is terrorism on a grand scale and his rhetoric of freedom is meant to pave the way for all-out annihilation. Nolan carefully hits all the beats of the superhero action flick in the right order Batman returns from exile has an initial victory followed by a crushing defeat and the loss of his powers and then must rebuild himself and make unexpected alliances in order to save the day. But the whole thing is cranked to 11 or maybe 13 the whole time so it becomes barely recognizable. I guess this counts as a minor spoiler but Batman receives a startling beatdown in this movie one that belongs more to the universe of crime films than superhero fantasy. Bane leaves him alive only because he wants to make Bruce watch Gotham suffer and needless to say that sadism will prove hubristic. (Even so Bane is ultimately revealed as a tragic-romantic figure pursuing mayhem and murder only out of love.) A fair piece of the story proceeds with Batman offstage and Bruce Wayne literally crippled and helpless.Arguably the Nolan-Goyer plot is unnecessarily complicated and loaded with MacGuffins starting with a dynamite hijacking sequence that opens the film and continuing through an exciting stock-exchange hostage-taking sequence and Selinas irrelevant quest for a nugget of software that will erase her identity and allow her to start afresh. After a terrific late plot twist and a bravura literally explosive conclusion that leaves Gotham -- and the mythical version of America it inhabits -- permanently scarred in a way Osama bin Laden could only dream about Nolan dutifully drops us off at the gateway to another sequel one he has said he wont direct. But he leaves future Batman filmmakers in an impossible position. Theyll simply have to try something different because for grandeur and pretension and evil genius and pure thrills -- for delivering exactly what the multiplex audience wants in tremendous style and undercutting it at the same time -- theres no way to top ""The Dark Knight Rises.""

But with The Dark Knight Rises the final installment of Christopher Nolans gargantuan gravitas-soaked Bat-trilogy it would have been fine to abandon all sense of logic narrative time. In fact it might have been more fun. Its not just that we already know Batman and his brooding rich-guy alter ego Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale baleful with and without voice modulator body armor and Bat-mask). And that weve been schooled in the malevolent pathologies of Batmans uber-nemeses Scarecrow in Batman Begins The Joker in The Dark Knight and now a mixed martial arts madman Bane. Thanks to a circus parade of Marvel and DC Comics screen adaptations weve grown accustomed to the sight of plummeting I-beams and crashing subway cars the police firing futile fusillades against hulking baddies a screaming populace making a run for it over bridges bent in half like playroom toys. The Dark Knight Rises has all of that - tied to a triple helix of backstories and betrayals history and hellfire. Its been four years since Batman took the fall for Harvey Dent alias Two-Face in The Dark Knight - eight years in Gotham City time. Does ausanybody but Police Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman spending a good deal of the new movie in a hospital bed) and Bruce Wayne himself really care? Just shoot off the fireworks and the cool new Bat-gizmos unleash the snarling platoons of thugs and mugs. Let Alfred (Michael Caine) answer a few Wayne Manor doorbells quipping Britishly. Let the femmes fatales - Anne Hathaway as a jewel thief with a penchant for catsuits and spike heels Marion Cotillard as a philanthropist with a past - coo and clinch with Bruce the recluse. . . . A surreal mashup of Bat-tropes is all we need. Instead theres a labyrinthine network of plots and subplots to navigate. Good luck. But if you just give yourself over to Nolans sweeping symphonic Cowled Crusader saga The Dark Knight Rises is well a blast. The opening sequence - a gravity-defying skyjacking and Russian-scientist-kidnapping - out-Bonds the Bond movies for adrenalized action. Hathaway all lips and legs is Selina Kyle also known as Catwoman and shes sexy and complicated - and straddles the big-wheeled Bat-Pod with utter aplomb. Joseph Gordon-Levitt one of Nolans dream teammates in Inception joins the Gotham City gang as police officer John Blake. His story of lost parents and foster homes and his dogged detective skills bring him and Bruce Wayne together inextricably. You want father figures? Bruce Wayne has three Caine misty-eyed and nagging; Oldman somber and sallow (and always referring to ""The Batman"" - does he also say ""The Facebook?""); and Morgan Freeman back again as Wayne Enterprises CEO Lucius Fox sage and sardonic. You want pop-cult connections zeitgeistian reverberations? With significant away-time somewhere in the Middle East - and with crowds of citizens rumbling up against the establishment - The Dark Knight Rises evokes images of the Arab Spring. Yes the League of Shadows and Ras al Ghul (Liam Neeson) - more business from Batman Begins - figure prominently here. And Nolan along with his screenwriting colleague sibling Jonathan Nolan literally storm Wall Street. The Occupiers in this case are the henchmen of arch-villain Bane (insert your Bain Capital joke here) and there are plenty of allusions to the 1-percenters and the 99. Even Wayne Enterprises has gone bust in this Great Recession. The Dark Knight Rises budget however shows no signs of decline. Production-wise effects-wise Nolans movie - much of its big action sequences shot with Imax cameras - is spectacular. If the idea of sinister construction crews laying a network of underground explosives across an entire cityscape is far-fetched the realization of that scheme onscreen - the detonations rippling seismically across a football stadium and freeway overpasses - is staggering. The biggest problem with The Dark Knight Rises - and its not a problem so much as a disappointment - is Tom Hardys Bane. Muscled up much of his face hidden by a black metallic mask that resembles a lobsters underbelly the English actor has been robbed of his tools. He has his eyes to work with but his mouth and face muscles are mostly concealed. And his voice is filtered through an octave-lowering wheezebox. Banes menacing mumblings sound a lot like Darth Vaders - Darth Vader doing Sean Connery. After Heath Ledgers wild heartbreaking performance as the Joker in The Dark Knight Banes mix of brawn and bad vibes seems generic. Nolan has said hes done with the Dark Knight now; its a Bat-wrap. But although The Dark Knight Rises ends in a furious finale of chaos carnage and cataclysm the filmmaker has brought things to a satisfying closure. And he has left his bosses at Warner Bros. with a big wide window of opportunity to jumpstart the franchise again. Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

PicturesBane (Tom Hardy) seeks to destroy Batman (Christian Bale) and Gotham in The Dark Knight Rises the conclusion to director Christopher Nolans Batman trilogy.Sponsored LinksChristopher Nolans intelligent take on the classic Batman comic book saga is grounded in complexity realism and grit. As in the previous two films the plot is intricate and the characters are multidimensional.However while its the most ambitious of the three films its not as mesmerizing as 2008s The Dark Knight. The plot is occasionally murky its archvillain lacks charismatic menace and the last hour is belabored.STORY Anne Hathaway takes action in Dark Knight RisesMORE Class warfare offers a rich canvas for big-screen dramaMORE Red Carpet Report Dark Knight premiereEight years have elapsed since Gotham has seen the caped crusader. His alter ego Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) has become a recluse mired in sadness and loss. Wayne/Batman paid a high price for doing what he believed was in the best interest of his beloved city. But he is drawn out of his self-imposed exile by a cagey cat burglar and a masked terrorist who threatens Gothams safety.Amidst the sprawl are timely political elements fomented by hulking terrorist Banes (Tom Hardy) determination to liberate Gothams citizenry from the shackles of government. Add in stock plunges and the demise of Waynes fortune and its clear there are undertones of current sociopolitical forces like the Tea Party and Occupy movements.While this adds substance to the tale the pile-up of characters is excessive. This final chapter lacks the offbeat humor of The Dark Knight mostly because no one can match the maniacal villainy of the late Heath Ledgers Joker.About the movieThe Dark Knight Rises out of fourStars Christian Bale Anne Hathaway Tom Hardy Marion Cotillard Michael Caine Joseph Gordon-Levitt Gary Oldman Morgan FreemanDirector Christopher NolanDistributor Warner Bros. Rating PG-13 for violence some sensuality and language Running time 2 hours 45 minutes Opens Friday nationwideBane is hampered by an elaborate black mask that covers most of his face with a mouthpiece that recalls Hannibal Lecters muzzle. This apparatus makes it nearly impossible for Hardy to give a full-scale performance and his Darth Vader-breathy dialogue is occasionally unclear.Bale remains superb as the tortured hero and the trajectory of his story comes to a poignant conclusion. The most moving scenes involve Wayne and his loyal butler/confidant Alfred (Michael Caine).A buoyant chemistry flares between Bale and Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle/Catwoman. Hathaway offers a charmingly fresh take on her character -- less feline (no purring thankfully) and more acrobatic playful and assertive than previous incarnations.Less impressive is the rather bland Marion Cotillard as environmental conservationist Miranda Tate positioned as Waynes love interest though they lack chemistry.Joseph Gordon-Levitt is affably noble as dedicated police detective John Blake a role that could figure into a potential spinoff.The opening sequence of aerial mayhem is more hectic than riveting. But the film takes off from there making for a compellingly superb first hour. Elaborate scenes of mass peril are perfectly calibrated for maximum tension. Visual effects are strikingly seamless but long periods while the city is under siege drag and scenes in an old world prison grow repetitive. A plot twist comes too late to the necessary impact.What stands out most particularly on IMAX screens is the films gorgeous cinematography. Nolans beautifully framed shots are remarkably artful such as the first quick glimpse of Wayne in the reflection of a silver platter.Nolan also skillfully juxtaposes sound and silence to heighten a mood. In a few scenes however Hans Zimmers musical score approaches bombast but then dials down and intensifies the action. Scenes of eerie quiet are particularly powerful.""A hero can be anyone"" says Bale as Batman. But its impossible to imagine anyone as pitch-perfect as Bale in the heroic role.And no one could have told the saga better than Nolan.

The 250 million he spent didnt hurt either.  |  out of 4 stars By Colin Covert Star Tribune July 20 2012 -- 632am Video (3846)  ""The Dark Knight Rises"" the superhero trilogy finale hits theaters on July 20. Amanda Marzullo Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Satisfying pop entertainment requires a foundation of inevitability enlivened by suspense surprise and shock. With the (probably) final installment of Christopher Nolans epic Batman saga all the set pieces are in place yet time and again the film pulls you up in your seat with wonder. Its been a while since a franchise movie gave me so many enjoyable opportunities to say ""No way"" ""Oh no they didnt"" and ""I never saw that coming."" Yet ""The Dark Knight Rises"" nods to the pleasures of the earlier installments from surprise cameos to character notes and cinematographer Wally Pfisters vertiginous visuals echoing 2005s ""Batman Begins"" and 2008s ""The Dark Knight."" Theres even a near-re-creation of that films unforgettable truck flip. Nolan spent a reported 250 million giving us all our moneys worth. The film opens with a grandiose action sequence a midair plane hijacking that is only an appetizer for the epic battles to follow. It builds to disaster-movie scenes of Gotham City collapsing aerial dogfights as thrilling and agile as a ""Star Wars"" shootout and cast-of-thousands brawls between criminal mobs and Gotham Citys finest. As an older cop tells his rookie partner when Batmans super-souped-up motorcycle joins their tire-screeching chase ""You are in for a show tonight son"" That first blast of Bat-action does not occur until 50 minutes into this cerebral 23/4-hour blockbuster. Nolan tells a complex expansive tale and he takes his time putting the elements in place. The time is eight years after Batman took the fall for killing crusading D.A. Harvey Dent. Police Commissioner Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) has used the Dent Acts sweeping powers to imprison those suspected of wrongdoing. Batman/Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) is in retirement disillusioned and physically crippled by his vigilante career. Ron Phillips Warner Bros. CHRISTIAN BALE as Bruce Wayne in THE DARK KNIGHT RISES. There are still pockets of criminality in the land though. At a tribute to Dent at Wayne Manor cat burglar Selina Kyle (a wickedly slinky Anne Hathaway) makes off with assorted valuables from Waynes safe beating him up and kidnapping a congressman in the process. If thats not enough to get his crime-fighting juices flowing she taunts him ""Theres a storm coming Mr. Wayne. You and your friends had better batten down the hatches cause when it hits youre all gonna wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little for the rest of us."" That storm is spearheaded by the fearsome Bane (Tom Hardy) a one-man wrecking crew from the League of Shadows the same Himalayan vigilante cult that trained Bruce Wayne. Bane is dedicated to wiping away Gothams conniving politicians freebooting financiers and everyone else in a brutal act of moral cleansing. He believes that the fabric of society is highly combustible. He merely applies the match that unleashes fear and chaos then rallies an army of urban terrorists. The film implies that Gotham had it coming. It finds contemptible characters in the upper 1 percent -- note the way a callous stock trader literally throws bills at his shoeshine man -- and the lower 99 who ransack mansions in mobs worthy of the French Revolution. And every villain claims he has justice on his side. The story by Nolan his brother Jonathan and David S. Goyer treats its comic-book material with unflagging intelligence. Yes the villains still pause to gloat and explain their master plan when they have the hero in their clutches -- will they ever learn? Yes the nuclear weapon that threatens Gotham ticks away with the obligatory red digital readout. Yes career-ending injuries can be overcome with chiropractic adjustment and some push-ups. Logic surrenders in the face of the films breakneck momentum. Nolans work is so assured that when a chase scene flips from daylight to night in a single cut we dont protest. Nolans cerebral dour films are never morally tidy. Bale digs deep into his character Is the eccentric millionaire playing the Batman or is the masked avenger impersonating Bruce Wayne? Intrepid beat cop John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) wears his own emotional mask to camouflage his murder-scarred past. Commissioner Gordon is wracked with guilt for hiding Harvey Dents identity as the murderous Two-Face. Alfred Pennyworth (an affecting Michael Caine) castigates himself for failing to guide Bruce toward a life in which love and everyday pleasures weigh more than vengeance. In this psychologically fraught drama even the villains nurse inner traumas. The monstrous Bane his face mask delivering anesthetic to numb his everlasting pain simply wears his damage most visibly. When its revealed how he came to need the respirator the film pauses for a moment of sympathy for the devil. The wrongdoers here never equal Heath Ledgers charismatic-psychotic Joker but neither are they stick-figure caricatures of evil. With his hypnotically expressive eyes and incongruous plummy English accent Bane is a weirdly suave skull-crusher. The denouement a cascade of startling reversals and reveals wraps up the story tidily while leaving enough wiggle room for additional follow-ups. Throughout the three-film arc Bruce Wayne has been courting death. Nolans finale gives us the inevitable with generous portions of suspense surprise and delicious shock.

Starring Christian Bale Anne Hathaway Tom Hardy and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Directed by Christopher Nolan. (PG-13. 165 minutes.) There is ambition behind ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Director Christopher Nolan and his collaborators distill everything that has happened in our world in the past four years - everything since ""The Dark Knight"" debuted in 2008 - and render it in nightmare terms. In doing so they try in the realm of fantasy to tap into the fears underlying modern life. In ""The Dark Knight"" the antecedent was 9/11 The vision of civic chaos and of the unrelenting unremitting evil embodied by Heath Ledgers the Joker expressed in popular art Americans deepest terrors in the first decade of this century. But in the final installment of Nolans Batman trilogy the antecedent is the financial crisis a much more muddled and less dramatic ongoing event. And it makes for a much more muddled and less dramatic movie ... that goes on and on and on. For about half its running time its reasonably entertaining but the other half - inevitably the second half - is something of a slog. The movie is self-important but with little ultimate importance and sentimental without much in the way of human feeling. But it has its moments - at 165 minutes it had better - plus Anne Hathaway enjoyable throughout as the movies nicely reimagined Catwoman.

TM and (c) DC Comics Photo Ron Phillips Image 15 of 15 The Dark Knight Rises review The bane of Batman 1 / 15 Back to Gallery A central weakness of ""Dark Knight Rises"" when compared to the other films is the absence of a compelling complicated villain. In place of Ledgers Joker we find Tom Hardy as Bane a bald muscleman with his face and nose covered in a black leather mask. Bane is a formidable presence and as evil as they come but he has a one-note personality without humor or nuance. Even worse with his voice distorted by that mask he sounds like Scooby-Doo which means that whenever he speaks for more than a sentence or two he sounds unintentionally funny not terrifying. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" takes place eight years after the conclusion of ""The Dark Knight."" Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) walks with a limp and lives in glum seclusion while Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) though presiding over a peaceful Gotham City nurses a haunted sense of inner compromise. Its a good time for the dark forces to strike which they do though exactly how they strike is a little hard to follow. Dastardly plot Banes dastardly plot involves a massive transfer of wealth using the stock exchange. It consists further of inciting civil unrest and taking control of cutting-edge technologies that can be used for good or ill. Nolans critique of Wall Street is implicit in the portrayal of the rapacious and arrogant Wall Street traders but some uneasiness about the Occupy movement is evident as well in the films depiction of peoples tribunals. However to say that the movie steers a middle course would be to impose coherence on what seems more like a scattered set of fears and impressions. In the end the heart of the movie - both in its viewpoint and its emotion - centers on the character of Catwoman who starts the film as a socialist-anarchist anticipating the coming revolution and then experiences a series of changes. The journey is to Nolans credit Its the first time someone actually thought through the role of Catwoman in the writing stage and gave a good actress something to play; that is beyond the demented sexpot of tradition. Strong impressions Marion Cotillard as one of Bruce Waynes sympathetic business associates and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as an aggressive rookie cop also make strong impressions. Others dont fare as well. Bales Batman has always been somber but now the depression seems clinical. His energy is a drag on the movie though some may like that. The movie also suffers from sequel-itis in that everyone gets his moment and these moments tend to showcase the characters deep sensitivity. For example Michael Caine as Alfred is so worried about Bruce Wayne that he cant seem to talk to him without getting choked up. After the first time this becomes funny. Moments are stretched. Every recollection must be illustrated by a flashback. Character motivations shift on a dime and if you understand even half of whats going on - not generally but specifically - youll be doing better than most. For long stretches theres little thats compelling and no point of the story to resolve or hold our interest beyond a vague concern for the fate of Gotham City. After two hours this concern fades. But two things keep ""The Dark Knight Rises"" from being dismissed as overlong overstuffed and tiresome though it is. The first is Nolans visual mastery his mix of the real and the fantastic in his vision of the modern city and his camera movements which somehow suggest three dimensions without 3-D. Its the world from ""Inception"" imposing and silver dizzying and impersonal but not without beauty. The movies second virtue may be disguised as a fault. In its borderline incoherence in its operatic and yet confused rendering of the financial crisis ""The Dark Knight Rises"" might better encapsulate the 2012 mind-set than a movie that makes complete sense.

Share Tweet As The Dark Knight Rises brings a close to Christopher Nolans staggeringly ambitious Batman trilogy its worth remembering that director chose The Scarecrow as his first villain--not necessarily the most popular among the comics gallery of rogues but the one who set the tone for entire series. With his crude potato-sack mask and fear-inducing toxins The Scarecrow a ""psychopharmacologist"" at an insane asylum acts as a conjurer of nightmares capable of turning his patients most terrifying anxieties against them. Hes an illusionist who relies on his victims to complete the illusion; without that unwitting collaboration he has no power at all. With The Dark Knight Rises Nolan expands on a comprehensive nightmare of the early 21st century again playing The Scarecrow to the many millions whose anxieties complete the illusion. Hes made a horror trilogy in the guise of summertime action-adventure a mind-blowing pulp allegory for Americas worst-case scenario Terrorist networks the surveillance state loose nukes kangaroo courts all-out class warfare the grim threat of fascism on one end and anarchy on the other. And at its center is an all-too-human hero whose courage and integrity masks a crippling uncertainty over whether he can beat back the darkness. Though it introduces another round of new characters including two antagonists in Bane and Catwoman The Dark Knight Rises impresses most in the way it integrates the mythology of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight into a larger whole. Where the previous two might have seemed like separate but related units the third reveals a master plan that goes beyond just another expensive mission for our caped crusader. In those early encounters with Ras al Ghul and his League Of Shadows in Batman Begins and the chaos stoked by The Joker in The Dark Knight Nolan was laying the groundwork for a titanic struggle between good and evil both in Gotham City and within the soul of its tormented vigilante. Picking up eight years after The Dark Knight left off the film finds Gotham enjoying a tenuous peace based on Harvey Dents moral ideals rather than the ugly truth of his demise. Meanwhile the hero Gotham deserves has retreated from public view and his alter ego Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) has gone Howard Hughes in his estate resigned to the margins while others mismanage his company and his city. But in the underground tunnel system a powerful new villain emerges in Bane (Tom Hardy) a bulked-out mercenary in a gas mask who may look and speak like a professional wrestler but who carries out a thoroughly considered plan to isolate Gotham and impose his own sadistic vision of government upon it. Those few in Waynes inner circle--Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) his loyal but disillusioned butler Alfred (Michael Caine) and his company and gadget man Fox (Morgan Freeman)--are alone in understanding the real Batman but several new characters of mysterious intent enter the picture too. Two women make semi-romantic overtures with questionable motives Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard) a wealthy board member who takes a keen interest in heading up Waynes super-secret clean-energy project and Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) an acrobatic cat burglar first seen robbing the reclusive billionaire right in front of his face. And while most of Gotham buys into the Dent legend go-getting young cop John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has faith in Batmans decency and takes on a larger role once Bane puts his plan into action. There are a few creaks and groans as Nolans gargantuan plot machine works up to speed but because The Dark Knight Rises has been conceived less as a standalone movie than the conclusion to a story in progress theres a pleasing continuity and momentum to it. Still paying off threads from the two earlier Batman films while handling a host of new developments takes some expository heavy-lifting which Nolan wisely breaks up with eye-catching spectacle like the opening sequence a plane-hijacking that recalls the zero-gravity dynamic of Inception. Once Nolan gets all the pieces into place and Banes master plan begins to unfold The Dark Knight Rises plunges headlong into the abyss as seemingly every grim paranoid post-9/11 fantasy comes to pass. While Heath Ledgers Joker set an impossible bar for colorful super-villainy Nolan draws a sharp contrast between the Jokers code-free nihilism and the fascist order Bane threatens on Gotham. Where the Joker preys on our fears of random irrational acts of terror Bane has an all-consuming dictatorial agenda thats more stable and permanent a New World Order thats been planned out with the precision of a military coup. Even his voice projected muddily though that steel mask has the authority of a prison-camp megaphone. Hes stronger than Batman physically and mentally which makes the ""rising"" part of The Dark Knight Rises an agonizing struggle to a hugely satisfying payoff. Though Banes sing-song voice gives his pronouncements a funny lilt he doesnt have any of the Jokers deranged wit and Nolan isnt interested in undercutting his seriousness for the sake of a breezier entertainment. (Having The Dark Knight Rises released the same summer as The Avengers is as close as genre fans get to a balanced diet.) For that he turns to Selina Kyle whom Hathaway plays with a sexy irreverence that never crosses into out-and-out camp. Shes the most dynamic character in The Dark Knight Rises a cloud of shifting allegiances who handles herself with a sleight-of-hand thats both verbal and physical--and more dexterous than the titans doing battle. Batman and Bane go to war over Gotham but shes the true lynchpin of the movie forced to decide whether she has a real stake in this world or whether she can continue to scam off its dysfunction. True to the director of Memento and The Prestige Nolan lays down twist after twist as the trilogy draws to a close but the true greatness of The Dark Knight Rises is how beautifully its integrated with the other two movies. Handling that mythology--to say nothing of the heavy freight of fanboy expectation--is superheroic in its own right but the miracle of Nolans Batman trilogy is the way it imprints those myths with the dread-soaked tenor of the times. Theres a catchall quality to the politics of it--the Occupy movement could be viewed here as unifying force or order-upending menace--but Nolan seems content to let his popular entertainment double as a Rorschach test. At a time when Hollywood seems incapable of doing anything that isnt a grand-scale fantasy Nolan has hijacked the form to bring it down to earth.

In case youd forgotten -- and the summer of 2012 has given us much to forget -- this is what a superhero movie is supposed to look like.With ""The Dark Knight Rises"" Christopher Nolan brings his Batman trilogy to a close with a majestic almost completely satisfying crash. Everything feels epic about the film the characters the effects the emotional stakes -- even the missteps (and there are more than a few). Because this director puts an individualists stamp on all his movies from ""Memento"" to ""Inception"" to the two films preceding this one ""Batman Begins"" (2005) and ""The Dark Knight"" (2008) hes that very rare creature a blockbuster auteur. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" feels personal and thats what separates it from dully efficient corporate products like ""The Avengers"" and cynical retreads like ""The Amazing Spider-Man."" Nolans a Wagner for the multiplex fashioning his operatic eccentricities on the grandest possible scale.How eccentric? ""Rises"" is a superhero movie whose superhero at times seems like a supporting character. Its eight years after the events of ""The Dark Knight"" and Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) has become a Howard Hughes-like recluse hiding in stately Wayne Manor and tending wounds both physical and psychic. Bale brings the crazy-eyed intensity that makes him so alarmingly enjoyable to watch but hes effectively upstaged by the films villain a hulking ogre named Bane who has a praying-mantis mouthguard and a voice on loan from Darth Vader. Through a combination of makeup and sheer will British actor Tom Hardy disappears far beneath the surface of this character while suggesting hideous depths. ""Youre pure evil"" someone gasps at Bane who thunders back ""Im necessary evil.""Bane whose roots intertwine with Batmans own and who had a particularly formative upbringing in a desert prison known as The Pit is leading an army of criminals with intentions that take a while to play out. Above ground Gotham City seems at peace; in the sewers and tunnels below an entire mirror-city of malicious enterprise flourishes and builds.Above ground too characters collide and collude. Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) pines for the return of Batman but spends too much of the film in a hospital bed; his eyes on the street include a doughty young beat cop played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt the ace in the hole of ""Inception."" Trusty butler Alfred (Michael Caine) gets off a few teary monologues about Bruces tormented soul and Wayne Enterprises head Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) is on hand to show off the new toys which are choice. While ""Rising"" lacks a mercurial scene-stealer like the second films Joker -- much less a performer with the pop baggage of the late Heath Ledger -- it manages to convince us that more is more. The most critical new character is Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) a.k.a. Catwoman -- although no one actually calls her by that name -- a stylish thief who robs from the one percent with coldhearted glee. (In fact theres a curious rhetoric coursing through much of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" in which the villains espouse what can only be called ""Occupy Gotham"" platitudes and early on shoot up the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Is Nolan on the side of the fat cats or the people? The answer is that one reads political meaning into superhero movies at ones peril.)Unexpectedly Hathaway is the films chief delight completely at home in ball gown or cat suit kickboxing thugs with a serrated stiletto heel and keeping Wayne/Batman off-balance with acidly deployed taunts. As is typical for this franchise the relationship between Selina and Batman teeters between lust and rivalry but Bales too dour to really catch fire and besides he has the love of a billionaire clean-energy maven (Marion Cotillard) to keep him warm. Such a waste; Hathaway is the first Catwoman to really give Julie Newmar on the old TV ""Batman"" a run for her money.Nolan who co-wrote the script with his brother Jonathan and David S. Goyer keeps piling it on until the seams of the genre threaten to snap and when Batman is sidelined for a central chunk of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" in a prison sequence morphed from an old French foreign legion movie you wonder how many balls this filmmaker can keep in the air. Yet where the second film at times turned into a muddle the scope and pace and endless details of this one conspire to keep a viewer mesmerized.If you want you can pick at the loose threads after the lights come up. Bane and his minions manage to take all of Gotham City hostage for months without intervention from the nations armed forces? Even for a fantasy film thats pushing it. A late-inning revelation about a major character seems there just because the movie needs a twist not because it makes any sense. (By contrast a tiny fact we learn about Gordon-Levitts character is a treat one last firework going off after the grand finale.) The movies unquestionably overlong. And please please someone tell Hollywood that we dont need another climactic Doomsday device with a ticking-clock countdown. Its done. Over. Move on already.Given all that why does ""The Dark Knight Rises"" carry one along with such breathless doomy conviction? Maybe its that Nolan and company are so clear on the costs of being a costumed vigilante -- that its more curse than blessing that a mask is better for hiding from the world than confronting it. Nolan delivers his summer-movie thrills with the concussive force we pay for but the most lasting seismic shocks lie within his characters not outside them. Most superhero movies play like upbeat origin stories but Nolans Batman trilogy represents a darkening vision that with this film earns its weight. Its the genres ""Twilight of the Gods.""Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com (c) Copyright 2012 Globe Newspaper Company.

""Get with the program"" scolds another letter from a brainwashed fan of the Batman-as-seen-through-the-pretentiousness-of-the-Christopher-Nolan trilogy ""You are a dinosaur"" Hes probably right and I probably would--if I could only make one lick of sense out of what this nonsense is all about. Silly pop-culture comic book cinema about grown men in rubber masks and Styrofoam jock straps is bad enough but incomprehensible gibberish to boot is just plain unacceptable. Halfheartedly I give The Dark Knight Rises--the third and final Batflick in the Nolan trilogy--one star for eardrum-busting sound effects and glaucoma-inducing computerized images in blinding Imax but talk about stretching things. Thats all most immature audiences require for their hard-earned money these days. The rest of it should not be reviewed by anyone over the age of 12. As caped crusaders go I prefer Superman Spider Man and above all Captain Marvel who has been criminally ignored by the movies so far. (Cant you just see Michael Fassbender staring into the camera hissing ""Shazam""?) And as Batman goes I had a lot more fun when he was fighting off Catwoman and The Joker at the Saturday afternoon double features of my youth in his campy bat cave with his jailbait roommate Robin. Drat Christopher Nolan sent Bruce Wayne to a shrink and Batman lost his mojo. I like one caption writers description of the Batman epics as ""car porn for geeks and gearheads."" But that doesnt make The Dark Knight Rises any better. Trash is trash but when it costs an estimated 250 million (bat food compared to The Amazing Spider-Mans 137 million) the charges turn criminal and someone should subject the garbage man to a citizens arrest. Like all previous flicks directed by Christopher Nolan and written by his brother Jonathan this one defies logic and reeks of repulsive bloated self-importance (not to be confused with anything resembling narrative) and the arrogant conviction that no matter how slick obtuse confounding or incompetent it gets the fanboys will slobber approval. Only a fool would tackle a synopsis but briefly We open eight years after Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) vanished in disgrace recovering from wounds inflicted by The Joker (Heath Ledger) and taking the fall for the death of phony hero and secretly corrupt D.A. Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckart). Haunted by the pain and tragedy of past losses and living in seclusion under Gotham City the 73-year-old superhero--having first risen under the tutelage of Bob Kane in 1939--is lured back into the daylight by neo-noir villains like sexy cat burglar Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) and a monstrous drug-fueled terrorist with a mumblecore voice named Bane (British muscle McGurk Tom Hardy) who commands an army of killers living in the sewers with a face covered by a gas mask (he speaks through a wind tunnel); old friends like police commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) corporate officer Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) and Bruces longtime butler Alfred (Michael Caine); and new allies like idealistic cop John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and the cunning enigmatic billionaire socialite philanthropist Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard) who joins the board of Bruce Wayne Enterprises to save the empire from going under and turns out to be too good to be true. The coherence ends there. Sick and bent over--his X-rays have him looking like matchsticks--Batman comes out of retirement to the musical accompaniment of Ravels ""Pavane pour une infante defunte"" digs the Batmobile out of mothballs and hobbles off to bring the world back into balance starting with the Stock Exchange. The rest of the movie which runs just under three hours is an interminable barrage of exploding football fields flying cars computer-generated images of crumbling skyscrapers and bridges and raging mobs fleeing the nuclear destruction of Gotham City. When all else fails Bane threatens to destroy the human race in 23 days with one brash act and Bruce ends up flat on his back in more ways than one. Christian Bale mumbles and whispers through an echo chamber changing his appearance and his voice for reasons known only to Mr. Nolan. Michael Caine chews holes through his dialogue with a peat-bog Cockney accent so thick you cant understand what hes talking about anyway. You can hoke it all up with crushing violence but that doesnt make it pleasurable. Amid an endlessly contrived pile of red herrings Marian Cotillards character seems like something they went back and invented in post-production while Anne Hathaway who turns out to be Batwoman in mufti comes off as a cold karate-chopping zombie with cleavage. There are so many plot twists I stopped counting. The Nolan brothers seem to be making it up as they go along. Not one character is developed beyond a flat one-dimensional cardboard paper-doll construct without heart and soul not to mention flesh and blood. Not one of these distractions invades the plot for any purpose except to extend the running time. Speaking lines they cannot possibly understand not one actor makes any attempt to be believable. So manufactured and synthetic that they eventually lose all sense of reality theyre like reconstituted orange juice and processed cheese. If The Dark Knight Rises is finally the funeral of Batman forever (promises promises) trendy technology once again triumphs over artistry professionalism taste and good clean fun. Turning a mosh pit of mystical comic book gimmicks into a money pit of metaphysical mumbo jumbo Christopher Nolan gives new meaning to both DUI and DWI--""Directing Under the Influence"" and ""Directing While Intoxicated""--while raking in millions.

"The Dark Knight Rises more than shines and on many levels - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review The Dark Knight Rises more than shines and on many levels The Dark Knight Rises Movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews Christopher Nolans The Dark Knight Rises starring Christian Bale Tom Hardy Anne Hathaway and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Kenneth Turan reviews Christopher Nolans The Dark Knight Rises starring Christian Bale Tom Hardy Anne Hathaway and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Potent persuasive and hypnotic ""The Dark Knight Rises""has us at its mercy. A disturbing experience we live through as much as a film we watch this dazzling conclusion to director Christopher Nolans Batman trilogy is more than an exceptional superhero movie it is masterful filmmaking by any standard. So much so that its considerable 2-hour 44-minute length notwithstanding as soon as its over all you want to do is see it all over again.That desire comes despite -- or perhaps because of -- the fact that ""The Dark Knight Rises"" might be the bleakest most despairing superhero film ever made. It uses a wholly terrifying villain to emphasize the physical vulnerability of a hero we sometimes forget is no more than human. And it underscores the black moods and sense of dark destiny that have always clustered around the psyche of billionaire Bruce Wayne and his somber compulsion to fight crime. Nolan and actor Christian Bale created wonders with this stern character in""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"" and the director has said he was determined to make this third film as good as the others.PHOTOS Tom Hardy the next Brando? Sharing the screenwriting credit with his brother Jonathan and story credit with David S. Goyer Nolan has woven characters and themes from both of his previous Batman films into ""Dark Knight Rises."" Returning regulars include Michael Caine as loyal retainer Alfred Morgan Freeman as Wayne Industries executive Lucius Fox and Gary Oldman as Gothams ever-conflicted Commissioner Gordon.New to Gotham but not to Nolans films is a trio of ""Inception""stars Tom Hardy who put on 30 pounds to play the physically daunting epitome of evil known as Bane; Joseph Gordon-Levitt who brings welcome texture to the role of the idealistic Gotham cop John Blake; and Marion Cotillard as Miranda Tate one of the more attractive members of the board of Wayne Industries. With the further addition of Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle a slinky second-story operative this Batman film boasts the most accomplished female acting of the trilogy.Also and almost unheard of in a superhero context ""Dark Knight Rises"" brings a whiff of contemporary societal trends -- or what Nolan has called ""the things that worry us these days"" -- into play. His film coolly mocks the pieties of both the right and the left starting with a jaundiced look at how law and order-obsessed societies start to rot from the inside when they are based on lies.PHOTOS Dark Knight Rises premiere The lies that begin ""The Dark Knight Rises"" are the ones that ended the previous film that Gotham district attorney Harvey Dent was a crime-fighting hero who inspired the tough-on-crime Dent Act rather than a psychotic vigilante called Two-Face and that Batman is a heartless thug rather than the hero who saved the city one more time.Understandably distraught by this turn of events (though they were his own self-sacrificing idea) Bruce Wayne has become a tortured recluse who walks with a limp and is so morose hes grown a goatee. And hes had Wayne Industries table a fusion project that idealistic board member Miranda Tate calls ""the worlds best chance for a sustainable future.""Batman may be in mothballs but the evildoers of the world are not idle. In the films bravura opening moments we see a death-defying bunch of commandos perform a spectacular mid-air hijacking rappelling down cables from a massive C-130 Hercules transport plane to take over a smaller CIA aircraft flying below. (This was an actual stunt pulled off in the air above Scotland; Nolan avoids computer effects whenever humanly possible.)PHOTOS Backlot Hollywood momentsThe force of evil behind all this is Bane ""Born in hell forged from suffering hardened by pain."" A mercenary who exploits the class-warfare rhetoric of returning power to the people for his own nefarious ends Bane is way scary two times over.As played by Hardy who has a flair for roles like this (""Bronson""""Warrior"") Bane intimidates first because of the threatening way he carries his imposing physical bulk. If that wasnt enough theres his mask.Covering half his face and making him look like Hannibal Lecter crossed with Darth Vader Banes surgically implanted mask supplies pain-killing gas that is essential in managing the agony generated by an old and savage injury. Its size can make what he says a bit hard to understand but its scare factor is off the charts. FULL COVERAGE The Dark Knight Rises on Hero ComplexMuch less disturbing but still very dangerous is the Catwoman-like Selina a grifter whose morality is as flexible as her body. Hathaway who has a gift for these troubled sarcastic roles (""Rachel Getting Married"") handles the part the casually assured way that Selina handles the world. ""Theres a storm coming Mr. Wayne"" she whispers chillingly in the billionaires ear. ""You and your friends better batten down the hatches because when it hits youre all gonna wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little for the rest of us."" With Gotham facing dire straits its incumbent on Batman to rouse himself from his self-inflicted stupor but the question is not only whether he can do it but whether he should. In the face of someone as brainy powerful and out-and-out ferocious as Bane is he out of his league. The answer as always with Nolans films is far from simple.The director benefits not only from the recurring presence of his performers but also from his top-flight crew with repeaters who include cinematographer Wally Pfister production designers Nathan Crowley and Kevin Kavanaugh editor Lee Smith and costume designer Lindy Hemming. Also returning is composer Hans Zimmer whose increasingly insistent percussive score (he told his orchestra ""Im going to treat you as if you were a primeval drum circle"") is essential in driving the film forward.PHOTOS Bat-tunes 10 Dark Knight dittiesThe close collaboration that this kind of creative familiarity ensures is key to Nolans ability to make such persuasive enveloping films as is the directors passion for all things old school and celluloid. He prefers to do stunts and effects in-camera if possible and works without a second unit director. (""If I dont need to be directing the shots that go into the movie"" he told the Directors Guild quarterly magazine ""why do I need to be there at all?"") He shot more than an hour of ""Dark Knight Rises"" on the massive IMAX film negative which improves the image quality even for those watching only in 35 mm.The impressive success of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" pleasantly confounds our notions as to where great filmmaking is to be found in todays world. To have a director this gifted turning his ability and attention to such an unapologetically commercial project is beyond heartening in an age in which the promise of film as a popular art is tarnished almost beyond recognition.

"The Dark Knight Rises (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Dark Knight Rises (PG-13) Director Christopher Nolan ends his Batman trilogy on a triumphant high. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com7/18/2012 Editor rating 4 When people lament the state of American movies they bemoan the recycled stories and stale conceits the cookie-cutter plots the impersonal craftsmanship the lack of artistry and daring in big Hollywood films. Im not talking the usual trap of falsely romanticizing the past There has never been a period of Hollywood cinema this crowded with remakes and franchises and sequels and reboots (even the hallowed Pixar has announced a sequel to Finding Nemo which already sounds even more unnecessary than The Godfather Part III). There are exceptions of course. But most of the serious contemporary American directors -- Quentin Tarantino Terrence Malick Paul Thomas Anderson David Fincher -- have cultivated their audiences and now play primarily to them. Every once in a while they get lucky with a breakthrough hit but theyre not necessarily swinging for the fences. With The Dark Knight Rises Christopher Nolan swings for the moon. Saddled with the impossible expectations surrounding the final chapter in his trilogy of Batman movies Nolan surprises by one-upping you. He gives you something even grander and more fantastic than you expected. He dreams big. This long sprawling layered epic with the requisite cast of thousands isnt ""fun"" in a popcorn-entertainment kind of way; its heavy but the weight is welcome in the midst of an evanescent summer movie season. Opening eight years after the events of The Dark Knight Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) has become a recluse his body battered and creaky (he needs a cane to walk) his alter-ego of Batman no longer needed in Gotham City where Commissioner Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) has exploited a lie to wage a successful war on organized crime. Then Bane (Tom Hardy) a terrorist thug with the build of a wrestler and a life-sustaining mask clamped to his face emerges from the citys sewers with an army of followers and a sinister intent. The screenplay of The Dark Knight Rises which Nolan wrote with his brother and frequent collaborator Jonathan crams a lot of themes and ideas into the framework of a superhero movie. Bane is a warrior for the disenfranchised and the forgotten and the ignored. His methods though are brutal and murderous and his solution to social and economic disparity is of the scorched-earth variety. Wayne is a billionaire -- rich enough to qualify as the one percent of Gothams one percent -- which makes him a target for Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) a seductive cat burglar whose proclivity for crime is fueled by a sense of entitlement (""How could you ever live so large and leave so little for the rest of us?"" she purrs into Waynes ear). Except the heros finances are waning Even he is not immune from an economic downturn one of the many ways in which Nolan deftly anchors his comic-book movie with a timely relevance. Waynes wealth has always been his only real superpower the thing that facilitates all his wonderful toys. But when Bane starts wreaking havoc in Gotham (his first target the stock market exchange) Batman must muster the resources to rise to the challenge. The Dark Knight Rises borrows key elements from several famed comic-book storylines most notably Knightfall in which Bane crippled Batman in a fight and Frank Millers The Dark Knight Returns in which an aging Batman was forced out of retirement his body creaking and groaning. But the movie is ultimately less devoted to loving homage and hero worship than to completing the story that started in 2005s Batman Begins. Nolan co-opts the superhero genre He plays by its rules and delivers some extraordinary set pieces many of them done with old-school practical effects instead of CGI. More than an hour of the film was shot with IMAX cameras to sensational effect because Nolan understands showmanship and spectacle and he uses Hans Zimmers rousing restless score to exhilarating effect. Nestled inside this brooding dark picture is a mandate to entertain. But Nolan isnt slavish to the demands of the superhero genre. He doesnt throw in periodic action beats just to keep the pace from flagging and he takes a centrist approach to the meaty political and social subtexts of his story which allows for a variety of readings and interpretations. The film has already been decried as everything from a Republican fantasy to an anti-Romney screed and it hasnt even opened yet a testament to how well Nolan achieved his goal This is not the sort of movie you can just leave behind in the theater. And like any true finale to a trilogy the picture doesnt work nearly as well if you havent seen the previous two installments Its not designed to stand alone and it pays off all that has come before with an exuberant thrilling high. The Dark Knight Rises is not without flaws. The story is so busy some minor roles are given short shrift such as the deputy commissioner of Gotham (played by Matthew Modine) who could have been excised entirely from the movie. For long stretches the tone is grim even by Nolans standards (he has never been a maker of cheerful films). Despite the seriousness of his intent Nolan is not above relying to comic-book logic and coincidences when he needs them. Hes not immune either from the cliche of the ticking time-bomb rapidly counting down to zero. But in the middle of such an ambitious picture those things dont matter. The Dark Knight Rises is an uncommonly well-acted summer movie. Bale has grown gracefully into the role of the tormented hero -- he has never been more commanding or vulnerable in the part - and Hathaway pulls off the seemingly impossible feat of rescuing Selinas cat mask from kitsch. Hardys portrayal of the imperious Bane will invariably be compared to Heath Ledgers Oscar-winning turn as the Joker arguably the most iconic performance of the last 20 years. But the comparison is unfair and facile because the characters could not be more different (or serve more different purposes) and Hardy most of his face hidden by a mask does subtle wonderful things with his eyes. For all its pomp and grandeur though The Dark Knight Rises is practically stolen outright by Joseph Gordon-Levitt as John Blake a conscientious police officer who like Wayne grew up an orphan. The actor is in many ways the audience surrogate into this strange complicated story Hes not a hero hes not yet corrupted or world-weary and he still believes perhaps naively in the infallibility of good. In one of the best scenes in the movie Blake tells Wayne about the inexplicable anger he feels in his bones and how hes learned to hide it by practicing smiling into the mirror. In Gotham City as in life everyone sooner or later needs a mask. The Dark Knight Rises is without question the final chapter in Nolans Batman saga. But oh what a way to go out.

Starring Christian Bale Joseph Gordon-Levitt Tom Hardy Anne Hathaway Director Christopher Nolan Release Opened Jul 19 2012  Editorial Review The Dark Knight Rises brings trilogy to a satisfying close By Ann HornadayThursday July 19 2012The chief question to be answered regarding ""The Dark Knight Rises"" Christopher Nolans deliriously anticipated third and final installation of his Batman films isnt ""Is it any good?"" or even as has been bandied about since it went into production ""Is it a Best Picture contender?"" The question rather is does ""The Dark Knight Rises"" soar to the thematic and stylistic heights reached by its predecessor the adored (some of us would argue overpraised) ""The Dark Knight""? Does it clear a bar set by Nolan and his star Christian Bale who have infused the franchise with vigor visual depth and solemnity (some of us would argue ludicrous self-seriousness) heretofore unseen in mere comic-book movies? Most important does ""The Dark Knight Rises"" achieve the impossible which is to bring a cherished cinematic chapter to a close yet manage to leave fans feeling not desolate but cheered? To that all-important question the answer is an unequivocal yes. Nolan together with the team he has been working with so profitably since 2005s ""Batman Begins"" has made a completely satisfying movie with ""The Dark Knight Rises"" one steeped enough in self-contained mythology to reward hard-core fans while giving less invested viewers a rousing adroitly executed piece of popcorn entertainment. Whats more Nolan has heroically resisted the siren call of 3-D that odious gimmick that has done nothing more for cinema than separate people from their money for no added visual or narrative value. Instead he has thrown in with IMAX whose bold detail and boxy framing are just right for this big-shouldered production. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" looks terrific from its handsome uncluttered production design and subtle costumes to impressively staged stunts that unfold with taut lucidity. In fact ""The Dark Knight Rises"" starts off with just such a set piece a nervy piece of mid-air showmanship in which the movies villain a terrorist thug named Bane (Tom Hardy) hijacks a CIA plane. Masked and alarmingly well-muscled Bane makes almost immediately for Gotham City where Bruce Wayne (Bale) has been living in wounded seclusion for the past eight years since he took the rap for killing a city hero named Harvey Dent. Of course theres more to the story than that a buried truth glancingly referred to in a weary speech delivered by police commissioner Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) who is attending a charity event on the grounds of Wayne Manor. Also in attendance a mysterious brunette named Selina Kyle who slinks around the guests with the silky feline assurance of a woman who knows she has at least seven or eight lives to go. To Nolans everlasting credit Selina Kyle is played by Anne Hathaway who proves to be the breakout star of ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Forget the gizmos gimcracks and Bat-things that Waynes techno-wizard Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) introduces in the course of the movie. Hathaway is the sensational secret weapon of this production a tart leggy operator who can turn on a dime from damsel-in-distress to canny kitten-with-a-whip. Hathaway infuses a welcome note of mischief and winking play to an enterprise that has too often been mired in its own sepulchral sense of gravitas. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is never more enjoyable than when Bruce Selina and their respective alter egos confront each other whether in all-out battle or something far more ambiguous. If Bruces encounters with Selina crackle with tantalizingly opaque desires his meet-ups with Bane are far less fun -- it has been eight years after all and compared with Banes roid rage Bruce isnt much of a physical match even behind the iconically contoured suit he wears as Batman. Nolan balances the visual finesse of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" with several scenes of brutal fights and sadistic torture -- interspersed with windy expository speeches about Why Im Doing This To You a structural hazard of the genre. Its a shame that Hardys face is hidden behind a Hannibal Lecter-esque mask of matte-black grill work thereby depriving viewers of two of the best lips in the business. The mask also renders Banes pronouncements borderline unintelligible When Batman and Bane argue its like listening to a Battle of the Synthesized Voice Boxes (""I see your Christopher Plummer sir and raise you one Darth Vader and a Clint Eastwood""). Nolan has taken the liberty of creating two brand-new characters for ""The Dark Knight Rises"" a rookie police officer played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and a sultry Wayne Enterprises board member named Miranda Tate played by Marion Cotillard. In addition to being terrific -- indeed crucial -- additions to the proceedings both hail from Nolans most recent film ""Inception"" which has inspired some of the most stunning visual and sonic effects of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" including a flawlessly calibrated action sequence ending at a Gotham City football game that Nolan stages with scale spectacle grandeur and even a touch of wit that has been in such short supply in previous Batman films. Relieving Hans Zimmers basso profundo musical score with welcome rests of muffled silence Nolan has created a less frenetic tableau than ""The Dark Knight"" in which the chase scenes so often dissolved into incoherence. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" features its share of incoherence too -- mostly in the form of too-busy back stories and alternately Machiavellian and muddled motivations. With a running time of nearly three hours Nolans valedictory indulges in flashbacks and explanatory montages that begin to feel like three films in one. Then theres the topical dissonance that sets in -- through no fault of Nolans or his co-screenwriter and brother Jonathan Nolan -- when a man named Bane turns out to be waging a war against capital rather than for it. If ""The Dark Knight Rises"" intended to grind a political ax of course Bane would be laughing maniacally as he shipped jobs overseas and sent profits to Swiss bank accounts. Still Nolan sneaks in some timely signifiers including 9/11 CIA renditions the race for sustainable energy and the recent financial meltdown. Hewing faithfully to Batmans libertarian leanings ""The Dark Knight Rises"" becomes an almost spiritual parable of anti-populism and unshakable faith in law order and the morally superior wisdom of the One Percent. But ultimately like all the movies ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is all about The One If the Batman trilogy has celebrated anything it has been the unfettered power of the individual over an ungrateful rabble a vigilante ethic that may have gone underground in ""The Dark Knight"" but that has never been critically questioned. Viewers will have plenty of time to argue those philosophical implications now that Nolans trilogy has wrapped. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" ends on a self-important note (not just quoting Dickens but erecting an actual monument no less) that would be insufferable if Nolan and Bale hadnt so clearly earned it. In addition to giving fans their fair share of entertainment value they helped make comic-book movies safe for good actors resulting not in great talent slumming but elevating the form. Arguably Robert Downey Jr. Michael Fassbender Mark Ruffalo and most recently Andrew Garfield owe some debt to Bale whose brooding tightly coiled psychological complexity found such a sympathetic outlet in Nolans densely composed style. Like one of most hotly pursued MacGuffins of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" Nolan leaves a clean slate by the end of the movie keeping a door open for Bales successors. A generous gesture to be sure but for now its difficult to imagine anyone else with such a perfect scowl for the cowl.Contains intense sequences of violence and action some sensuality and profanity.

Goyer Starring Christian Bale Anne Hathaway Liam Neeson Morgan Freeman Gary Oldman Michael Caine Marion Cotillard Joseph Gordon-Levitt Classification PG Genre action Year 2012 Country USA Language English Some things are just required.Early on in the imposing finale of Christopher Nolans Batman trilogy when one character tells another that the caped crusader must return from exile there is grave doubt that he will. The blunt response ""He must.""He does - Batman is back an underdog as never before in a high-budget thriller with depth inventive storytelling and superbly crafted action. There is resolution and even more important there is room for sequels. This undated film image released by Warner Bros. Pictures shows Anne Hathaway as Catwoman in a scene from the action thriller The Dark Knight Rises. AP In pictures Shadows of The Dark Knight With The Dark Knight Rises Nolan had ambitious aims for the franchise he revived.Its not only packed with high-toned classical and contemporary cultural allusions but manages to wear its popcorn inspirations on its sleeve. On the latter front there are touches of Rocky as well as Die Hard but never far are echoes of 9/11 and the U.S. financial collapse of recent years. (The villain is named Bane which intended or not brings to mind this years Republican candidate for president and his infamous corporate alma mater.)Stylistically Nolans tone is both epic and human - this is a film ultimately about fear and how it is overcome. The message - ""rising from the darkness"" - is adroitly and powerfully addressed Bruce Wayne must rebound from personal loss; Gotham must emerge from a terrorist attack.Not to say its all weighty. Catwoman is the source of a few adroit inside jokes. She is played surprisingly with panache and a seemingly 16-inch waist by Anne Hathaway. ""A girls gotta eat"" is how Catwoman justifies her life as a burglar if not her tiny figure.It all begins at Wayne Manor where there are no strange happenings. Indeed there are no happening at all A brooding Bruce Wayne - Christian Bale again to the manner born in this role - is hobbled and humbled in ways physical emotional and financial. The war on crime was won by the end of 2008s The Dark Knight and Wayne is uneasily retired as a crime fighter.Money doesnt sleep though and peace doesnt last. Gotham City is overrun by thugs led by Bane - a primal brute who sounds like Sean Connery and is built like the Hulk (an instantly classic turn by Englishman Tom Hardy) who pledges to liberate the city (under the threat of major explosives) and release the oppressed. On the surface this is Bastille-storming and palace revolt.The bulk of the thumping high-octane action doesnt take place on the surface at all but in Gothams sewers which provide Nolans film with a perfect noir setting. When the bombs detonate from below the city collapses under its own weight - ""structures are shackles"" Bane mumbles through his creepy muzzle.Michael Caine again stands out as the soulful butler of Wayne Manor Alfred Pennyworth.This is a sequel that succeeds meeting expectations built ridiculously high by fan culture and savvy marketing. In the end Nolans Dark Knight rises to the occasion.

Comments (21) click to enlarge The Dark Knight Rises Video Rated PG-13  164 minutes  2012 After the anarchic laughs and cagey political allegory of The Dark Knight (2008) Christopher Nolans Batman trilogy sinks back to the level of the thundering self-serious Batman Begins (2005). Christian Bale has always been a stiff as the Caped Crusader but the second movie was blessed with Heath Ledgers outsize performance as the Joker; the celebrity villain this time around is Anne Hathaways Catwoman and while her shiny black leotard may conjure up impure memories of Julie Newmar her snarky line readings cant compare with the show Ledger put on. The script by Nolan and his brother Jonathan takes a few vague pokes at Wall Street and the financial elite but mainly revives the ponderous psychodrama of the first movie. Tom Hardy Marion Cotillard and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are the other new faces here; returning to grab one last paycheck are Gary Oldman Michael Caine Morgan Freeman Cillian Murphy and Liam Neeson.

"Review Dark Knight Rises - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Dark Knight Rises A Knight to fray the nerves -- 2 1/2 stars Chicago Tribune Eight years after the camp frippery of ""Batman amp; Robin"" (1997) in which Arnold Schwarzeneggers Mr. Freeze and Uma Thurmans Poison Ivy played dress-up while George Clooney let his nipply bat-suit do most of the acting director and co-writer Christopher Nolan brought to the screen the origin story of Bruce Wayne and his tortured emotionally isolated crime-fighting alter ego. Stately and just serious enough ""Batman Begins"" was trumped by Nolans own 2008 sequel ""The Dark Knight"" which channeled a planets worth of post-9/11 panic and pitted Christian Bales masked vigilante against Heath Ledgers unforgettable merry psycho. Despite a cool billion at the worldwide box office that film like any studio machine worth its salt was not for everyone. The atmosphere of grim free-floating dread along with Nolans grandiosity and his occasionally flat-footed way with a complicated action sequence tipped the experience into ""not much fun"" for some. Not for me. For me ""The Dark Knight"" was a memorable death cackle and a striking vision of Gotham City that familiar dream metropolis on which all our worst fears as law-abiding citizens are continually enacted on the brink of annihilating chaos. It felt right -- exploitive but shrewdly so -- for the unraveling times. Now comes ""The Dark Knight Rises"" which makes ""The Dark Knight"" look like ""Dora the Explorer"" and is more of a 164-minute anxiety disorder than a movie. Nolans third in the planned trilogy will likely satisfy many who fell headlong into the previous two. The new film works on your nervous system the way composer Hans Zimmers kettle drums of doom keeps tightening the screws long after the screws are tight. There are many things to admire in ""The Dark Knight Rises"" and Nolans bombast is a far far higher grade than youd find in a ""Transformers"" movie. But nothing in the new film which turns Gotham over to the masked terrorist Bane played by an occasionally intelligible Tom Hardy meets or exceeds the crises of ""The Dark Knight"" especially that pictures ferry-boat sequence where Gothams residents found themselves in a no-win situation and somehow won anyway. Nolans notion of amping up the evildoing in ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is to simply layer the slaughter in higher and higher piles though with a refreshing lack of computer-generated imagery. Theres plenty of that too once bridges start blowing up and Gothams 3000 police officers (a figure apparently referencing the 9/11 victims) are trapped underground while Bane goes crazy above ground. But at least Nolan shoots on film and didnt release ""The Dark Knight Rises"" in 3-D. Who needs an anxiety disorder on an IMAX screen and in 3-D? The film picks up eight years after Wayne taking the rap for the murder of district attorney Harvey Dent has slunk into exile with only Michael Caines Alfred around for company. Gotham has won the war on organized crime smeary-clown-makeup division. But a nerve-racking alum of the League of Shadows has taken the Jokers place and this barely human bull Bane a survivor of the worst underground prison around plans to loose all of Gothams  worst criminals and turn the city into a perpetual melee of anarchy. The script by Nolan and his brother Jonathan stirs in the cat burglar known as The Cat (Anne Hathaway) as well as a philanthropist (Marion Cotillard) with an interest in Waynes cold-fusion energy research. The films great whatzit is a nuke with a six-mile blast radius and the films final hour hinges on the imminent possible elimination of 12 million souls. The film in its entirety works as a granite-fisted one-two punch First we hear how awful things are going to get and then they get that awful or worse. And then a little worse than that. This is how most lucrative franchises proceed. The final ""Harry Potter"" film following its source material spun an ashen and destructive tale of survival amid carnage beyond previously known limits. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" features a full complement of cool toys including a flying machine and (in one of the films few actual laughs) a hand-held accessory that Bales Wayne uses to shut down cameras wielded by an entire wolfpack of paparazzi. But grievous bodily harm dominates the landscape and the way Nolan films two key hand-to-hand combat sequences between Bane and the Batman the (literally) back-breaking nastiness is just sort of a drag. In all sorts of stories the tellers must answer the question How much do we allow the evil to dominate to set the tone of whatever apocalyptic scenario is being unfurled for our amusement? Nolan I think fell a little too in love with Bane even though he sidelines him for much of the movie. The scale of the destruction here is monumental; at one point a pro football game turns into a deathtrap the playing field falling away from the players the result of a string of explosives. The worst comes just after we hear a sweet little preteen boy delivering the national anthem when Nolan cuts the realistic sound altogether and shows us just how far Banes team (and the filmmakers themselves) will go to impress us. The effects are excellent. The effect is numbing. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is not dull or even overlong despite its running time. Its more an example of what one character in a cameo refers to as ""the decadence of Gotham"" -- Gotham in this case meaning Hollywood. Nolan amalgamates the second movies 9/11 breakdown vibe with rampant murderous visions of class warfare and economic despair. (In one attack Bane and his minions open fire on the stock market and use traders as disposable hostages.) What worked beautifully in ""The Dark Knight"" seems overworked and almost ridiculously grim in ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Also I doubt the IMAX Theatre on Navy Pier is presenting the film in premium conditions; quite apart from the sound-design controversy involving Hardys plummy vocal inflections getting lost in the digital mix as Bane the acoustic balance between the dialogue and composer Zimmers shut-up-already musical score cannot possibly be what Nolan and his collaborators intended at least as heard on Navy Pier. Not that anyones actually listening. Like its predecessor this one has only one thing on its mind. It means to string the audience along while stringing it out on a bloody masquerade performed by masked pretenders. In its chosen vision of the world each hard-won triumph feels like a momentary reprieve from the next 9/11. Bruce Waynes millions come and go but the bat suit is forever. Thats some comfort anyway. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating PG-13 (for intense sequences of violence and action some sensuality and language) Running time 244 Opens midnight Thursday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Movies Entertainment Christopher Nolan The Dark Knight Rises (movie) The Dark Knight (movie) September 11 Attacks Crime Law and Justice Photos Dark Knight Rises premiere 10 movies to see this summer Dark Knight Rises Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising76deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/chi-dark-knight-rises-movie-review-20120717,0,3676879.column",200,thedarkknightrises26,thedarkknightrises,chicagotribune

CAST Christian Bale Tom Hardy Anne Hathaway Michael Caine LENGTH 244 Class warfare terrorism 9/11 and societal collapse flicker ominously throughout ""The Dark Knight Rises"" Christopher Nolans third and final Batman film a work of escapist entertainment that also poses IMAX-sized questions about America and its recently rocked foundations. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt but ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is an epic and then-some send-off to a character and a franchise that made it safe for superheroes to get serious. Though not so serious that fans wont enjoy themselves. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" provides the missing pieces to the story of billionaire Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) who fought his first evildoers in 2005s ""Batman Begins"" but lost the spiritual battle against The Joker in 2008s ""The Dark Knight."" Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Opening eight years later with a rusty Wayne emerging from self-imposed exile ""The Dark Knight Rises"" introduces two classic but modernized Batman villains. One is Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) a lowborn cat burglar who preys on the rich and the other is Bane (Tom Hardy) a masked monstrosity who stokes the populist rage of Gotham while leading it toward doom. Its all right that both villains combined dont add up to Heath Ledgers infectiously insane Joker (never mentioned here). Hathaways sneer is almost as deadly as her serrated high heels and her anti-elitist sarcasm provides the films few moments of humor; Hardys tank-like body is a thing of impressive ugliness even if his accent -- a distracting mix of British Russian and German movie villains -- is just plain ugly. Nolan confidently juggles several armfuls of characters with appealing new faces like Marion Cotillard as the eco-conscious Miranda Tate and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the idealistic cop Blake meshing nicely with familiar figures like Oldmans Commissioner Gordon and Morgan Freemans gadget-developing Lucius Fox. More than ever Michael Caine as the faithful servant Alfred feels like the secret heart of the story. Things bog down badly with a late-hour spiritual odyssey that weve seen before and there are moments when characters lapse into comic-book speak delivering lengthy explanations of their nefarious plans. But ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a satisfyingly grand finale to this series and -- surprise surprise -- a rousing opening chord to another. advertisement | advertise on newsday PLOT Eight years after his retirement Batman faces his most powerful foe yet.

Photo Christian Bale as Batman in The Dark Knight Rises. ((c) DC Comics) Batman is lured back into action after a lengthy hiatus -- to prevent a terrorist from nuking a Gotham City closely resembling the Big Apple -- in the imposingly dark and hugely entertaining ""The Dark Knight Rises. Superhero movies are perhaps the most predicable genre out there right now (sorry Marvel fans) but take it from someone who can usually spot plot twists half an hour away Christopher Nolans dramatically and emotionally satisfying wrap-up to the Dark Knight trilogy adroitly avoids cliches and gleefully subverts your expectations at every turn. Eight years after the end of 2008s ""The Dark Knight Christian Bales Bruce Wayne is a shattered recluse who hobbles around his mansion on a cane following the death of his fiancee -- and his long-unseen alter ego Batman is being blamed for the death of DA Harvey Dent. PHOTOS THE DARK KNIGHT RISES FILMING IN NY Bruce is finally forced to don the Batsuit again though after a fusion device he helped develop is stolen and weaponized. The villain is Bane (Tom Hardy) a hulking bald terrorist with a grotesque mask that includes a Darth Vader-like voice synthesizer. Introduced in a spectacular airborne stunt sequence straight out of a James Bond movie Bane simultaneously traps almost all of Gotham Citys police force in an underground tunnel demolishes half a football stadium and announces to Gothams populace that hes turning over the city to the 99 percent. The citys presumed-guilty wealthy citizens -- who no longer include Bruce thanks to Banes stunningly staged attack on the Gotham Stock Exchange -- are sentenced by a French Revolution-style court even as Bane blows up all the bridges to prevent escape from his planned thermonuclear special event. The ever-reliable Alfred (Michael Caine) Wayne Enterprises CEO and master inventor Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) and the gravely injured Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) have Batmans back in his quest but that isnt enough. He must also forge more ambiguous alliances with the slinky Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) who he catches burgling his mothers necklace; as well as Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard) an icy millionairess who helped fund Bruces reactor. Another member of Nolans ""Inception ensemble Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays a dedicated young cop with crucial links to Bruce Wayne. Written by Nolan his brother Jonathan and David S. Goyer ""The Dark Knight Rises almost rivals ""Inception"" for complexity and some of the political satire doesnt really work. Midway through I was having some doubts about whether Nolan could pull it off. But boy does he ever. In the last half hour everything clicks smashingly together also tying in characters and situations from the first two films -- as well as featuring some of the most emotional sequences ever from a director who has a deserved reputation for coolly cerebral work. Bale does the best acting of his career here as the anguished hero and Hathaway is far more effective than I could have imagined bringing humor to her role without edging into camp (and no Selinas never referred to as Catwoman no matter how outre her taste in action gear). Given the impossible task of following the late Heath Ledgers Oscar-winning performance as the Joker Hardy is nowhere near as memorable but still quite effectively scary -- and a formidable physical adversary for Bales Batman. ""The Dark Knight Rises builds to a pulse-pounding nail-biting climax thats loaded with the kind of surprises that were so absent in some other recent superhero movies that I could mention. Nolans apocalyptic 9/11-inflected vision of Manhattan and its hero are far more viscerally engaging in a real-world way than the fan-pandering silly fantasy counterparts that Marvel offered up in both ""The Avengers and ""The Amazing Spider-Man. I saw this seriously spectacular-looking (and thankfully not 3-D) movie much of which was shot using 70mm IMAX cameras at the Lincoln Square IMAX -- and strongly recommend that you see it on the biggest screen you can afford.

""Youre just waiting for something bad to happen.""Then something bad -- very very bad -- does happen in the form of the brutal Bane who has come to a peaceful Gotham City to lead his own devious evil version of the Occupy movement a revolution against the citys wealthy and powerful. Oh and hes brought a whole army of thugs and mercenaries with him. Pennyworths worst fear comes true The Batman will return to the streets for what given the power of Bane may be his last battle.Make no mistake about it ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a spectacular show. The visuals are extraordinary. The action sequences are dazzling especially so since Nolan uses very little CGI relying instead on old-fashioned stunt work. It will be hard to shake some of the images whether its the stunning midair plane hijacking that opens the film Batman tooling through Gotham on his cool toys or Bane blowing up a stadium during an NFL game.But the real power of this final chapter is just how intelligently it melds references to and commentary on modern concerns while staying true to its comic-book roots and including touches fanboys love such as the addition of Selina Kyle (the Catwoman although shes never called that) to the cast of characters.Advertisement Nolan and his brother Jonathan a frequent collaborator have written an audacious take on the Batman myth that draws from elements of Frank Millers 1986 graphic novel ""Dark Knight"" and from the Bane-driven ""Knightfall"" series from the mid-1990s without copying them. They touch on real-world fears such as terrorism collapsing economies and domestic extremism. Underlying the whole script is the greatest terror of all that someday everything in our lives will spin completely out of control.""Theres a storm coming Mr. Wayne"" Kyle purrs at one point. ""You and your friends better batten down the hatches cause when it hits youre gonna wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little for the rest of us.""To lay out the storyline in detail dances on the edge of spoiler given the significant number of twists turns and surprises Nolan tosses in. He never cheats; he includes enough clues as to whats happening that nothing really comes completely out of left field. While there is no performance here quite as wondrous as the late Heath Ledgers as the Joker in ""The Dark Knight"" the casts work is sterling from the big roles to the smallest.Christian Bale was fine as the Batman in the first two films but he is even better here adding nuance and shading that was absent before. Anne Hathaway provides some much needed zest and sarcastic wit (she gets most of the good lines) as Kyle. ""Dark Knight"" veterans Gary Oldman (Commissioner Gordon) Morgan Freeman (Lucius Fox) and Michael Caine (Alfred Pennyworth) are at the top of their games. Tom Hardy has the hardest role as Bane since hes asked to speak his lines through a mask that makes him sound like Darth Vader without the heavy breathing. Even with that handicap he still manages to project a feeling that Bane may not be the completely mindless brute he appears. Keep an eye on the luminous Marion Cotillard (""Inception"" ""Midnight in Paris"") who provides just the right measure of allure smarts and mystery as wealthy philanthropist Miranda Tate. And Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives a wonderful performance as young police officer John Blake who plays a big role in the film.There are some problems. At 2 hours and 45 minutes it is a draining film; you may find yourself yearning for a bathroom break. There are more than a few holes in the storyline and at least one major continuity issue when a scene starts in broad daylight and abruptly ends in the dead of night. (Even in Gotham it doesnt get dark that fast.)But those flaws dont keep Nolans ""Dark Knight Rises"" from being a superb bit of work from a truly visionary filmmaker and a marvelous final installment on a grand retelling of the Batman saga. As a cop tells a younger partner when Batman first reappears ""Boy youre in for a show tonight son.""

The Dark Knight Rises Good Director Christopher Nolan. Cast Christian Bale Tom Hardy Anne Hathaway. Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action some sensuality and language. And although it strains a bit at times it mostly shoulders the burden well. Its not just a big movie its a huge one with mammoth set pieces mind-teasing action scenes and frequent giant explosions. No one at the moment is better at executing those kinds of elements and still managing to keep the movie about the people in it than Christopher Nolan who directs and contributed to the screenplay. The toys and gizmos are as cool as you would expect. But the real question here is whether Bruce Wayne can redeem himself let the Batman go and if we didnt care about that all the tricks and twists would mean nothing. Avoiding the Dark Knight Rises hype (sort of) Hotlist villains in Batman But we do care. If the film is not quite the achievement ""The Dark Knight"" was -- and maybe thats the real question -- its still a fitting end to a very ambitious series. The movie begins eight years after ""The Dark Knight"" ends with the late Harvey Dent being remembered as a hero and Batman (Christian Bale) as the thug who killed him and who hasnt been seen since. Commissioner Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) knows better of course and although the streets of Gotham are safer than they were when the likes of the Joker ran free trouble is brewing. We know that from the opening scene a remarkable aerial sequence in which the feared criminal Bane (Tom Hardy) a hulking bald man who wears a scary-looking mask over his nose and mouth pulls off a seemingly impossible escape. Its all part of a larger plan meant to wrest control of Wayne Enterprises. Or so it seems. Actually its part of an even larger plan. Think of the Occupy movement led by an insane genius who lacks remorse and is willing to annihilate a major city to make his point. This goes back to Nolans original Batman film 2005s ""Batman Begins"" in which Ras Al Ghul (Liam Neeson) who is invoked several times here believed the only way to save Gotham was to destroy it. Its a brutal form of class warfare at least on its face. Meanwhile Bruce Wayne has become a recluse. But hes shaken from his doldrums in an unusual fashion by being robbed of his mothers pearl necklace and more important his fingerprints. Anne Hathaway plays clever cat burglar Selina Kyle who warns Wayne that a storm is coming and ""youre all going to wonder how you could ever live so large and leave so little for the rest of us."" (See Occupy movement above.) She stirs something in Wayne and while hes creaky after being out of the game so long its inspiring when hes finally weaving in and out of high-speed traffic on his Batcycle accompanied by Hans Zimmers familiar score. Another plot thread involves Wayne trying to save his business by turning it over to rich philanthropist Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard). And butler Alfred (Michael Caine) and Wayne executive Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) remain loyal to Wayne even if he exasperates them. Wayne and Batman will need all the help they can get. In addition to Commissioner Gordon help also arrives in the form of John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) the one beat cop in Gotham who understands the bigger picture and how much is at stake. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a bleak film yet not without hope. Then again as Bane points out there can be no true despair without hope. Keep that in mind ... Bale remains good as Batman and more important as Wayne. Hed love to hang up the suit for good but still struggles with how to make that happen. Oldman as Gordon gets more screen time than before and more Oldman always is welcome. As for the newcomers Hathaway is surprisingly good as Selina -- if you were worried about her being too light or frivolous dont be. Shes a cold-blooded thief and good at it. Gordon-Levitt meanwhile makes Blake the believable ally Batman needs. Like Wayne he was orphaned and he knows a thing or two about how the Batman feels. That leaves us with Hardy a tremendous actor left unrecognizable beneath Banes mask. Comparisons with Heath Ledgers genuinely great performance as the Joker in ""The Dark Knight"" are unfair and unavoidable. Hardy is a plenty good actor to make any character magnetic -- but the role has to live up to his talents. Ultimately Bane doesnt. He boasts a frightening intellect a few choice one-liners and literally backbreaking strength. But he lacks the shoot-out-the-lights personality of Ledgers Joker. But what character doesnt? Its not a fatal flaw however. Nolan has to tie up a lot of loose ends and that proves tricky at times. But overall ""The Dark Knight Rises"" brings the Batman story to a close in enormous satisfying fashion not just on the huge scale it builds for itself but on a human level as well.

"Dark Knight Rises The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; dark-knight-rises-the ) Dark Knight Rises The (United States/United Kingdom 2012) July 17 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli For most superhero franchises the third movie is a trap. Its there that the Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher iteration of Batman started its rapid descent. Its there that the Christopher Reeve Superman saga had the wheels come off. Its there that Sam Raimi lost his way with Spider-Man. The list goes on. Movie 3 at least when it comes to a comic-book inspired series is often one too many the result of greed not creative necessity. Its a little different with Christopher Nolans The Dark Knight trilogy because the second sequel named The Dark Knight Rises is also the last chapter. And not having to plan for a fourth installment affords the filmmaker an extraordinary opportunity the ability to conclude a superhero saga. Thats something we really havent seen before (although it kind-of sort-of happened with X-Men). In fact its so rare that it could be argued that Nolan has ventured into virgin territory. Nolans decision to make The Dark Knight trilogy a self-contained series allows us to consider the previously unthinkable going in Could Batman die? If theres a given in any superhero movie its that the title character will be around at the end credits. No spoilers here - Im not going to reveal the Caped Crusaders fate - but the potential of his demise will be in many viewers thoughts before they see the movie. And thats the genius of the way Nolan has sold and constructed his films. Never have the stakes been higher in a product of this genre. There will probably never be a darker superhero series than what we have seen with Batman Begins The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises; these movies have forever altered the way viewers see superhero stories and the way filmmakers approach them. Before Batman Begins there was a standard template that most superhero movies followed (some more closely than others). Batman Begins cracked the mold and The Dark Knight smashed it. Those werent lightweight entertainment for popcorn-munching Saturday matinee viewers. They were deep rich motion pictures - films that could proudly stand alongside any serious Oscar contender released in November or December (although inexplicably The Dark Knight was snubbed in the Best Picture category with The Curious Case of Benjamin Button getting a nod instead). Now makers of superhero movies are faced with a choice either go huge like The Avengers or go serious like The Dark Knight. Nolan has helped render the traditional approach obsolete. The Dark Knight Rises is the longest darkest and most ambitious of the three. In the final assessment it must be acknowledged that Nolan has perhaps overreached in trying to top The Dark Knight yet this is by no means a failure. The structure is a little unwieldy theres too much exposition and too little Batman and one twist is transparent from the early going. The Dark Knight Rises ultimately justifies its length (in fact a good argument could be made for a longer cut) and the last 45 minutes is nothing short of spectacular. From the point where the narrative takes a leap of faith it never lets up. Fans of the Caped Crusader have a long wait before he makes his appearance and when he finally arrives he isnt what he used to be. A commentary on mortality perhaps? Its not the only philosophizing Nolan does. As was true in the previous installments he shows an obsession with sociology and the essence of human nature. When faced with the grimmest possible outcome do people turn rabid? Or as The Joker learned is there something more enlightened buried deep within mankind? A lot of what happens during the course of The Dark Knight Rises hearkens back to Batman Begins not only in terms of thematic content but in terms of narrative thrust. The story opens eight years after the conclusion of The Dark Knight when Batman rode off into obscurity to allow the image of the disgraced Harvey Dent to remain unsullied. Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) has become a recluse a broken man hidden away in his rooms with only his faithful butler Alfred (Michael Caine) to tend to his needs. He pines for a lost future with the long-dead love of his life Rachel. Enter Bane (Tom Hardy) the masked mercenary once ex-communicated from The League of Shadows by Ras Al Ghul (Liam Neeson seen only in flashbacks and dreams). He has come to Gotham to wreak havoc an activity at which he is an expert. Not unexpectedly this is a cover for his true motives. Only Batman can stop him but Batman is no more. By the time Bruce pays a visit to Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) and see what new gear this Q-like tinkerer has invented he has acquired two sidekicks. The first is Detective John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) a disciple of Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman). The second is a nimble cat burglar named Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway). Bane however proves to be far more than the aging injured Batman can overcome and Selina is not as trustworthy as Batman initially believes her to be. The level of suspension of disbelief for The Dark Knight Rises is high but not as high as that for The Avengers or The Amazing Spider-Man. Despite its dark tone and sometimes lugubrious approach this is first and foremost a superhero movie as is evidenced by some kick-ass action sequences. Most of these are more hardware-oriented than physical in nature although there are a couple of one-on-one grapples between Batman and Bane and Catwoman/Selina gets her kicks in on more than one occasion. But the highest octane action comes with vehicles attached Batcars Batplanes and a Batcycle with new and improved handling. Nolan knows how to use this stuff without overdoing it. No fear of CGI overload here and thankfully no 3-D (You cant get it even if you want it although Im not sure who would fall into that category. You can get IMAX though if you wait long enough for a seat to open up.) Batman is more heroic more flawed and more conflicted than in either of the previous two movies. At times he makes Hamlet look decisive. In the end we get the character we yearn for but a lot has to happen for the movie to get to that point. Jonathan Nolan admits to having been influenced by Charles Dickens A Tale of Two Cities when writing The Dark Knight Rises but one line more than any other became the seed that germinated the final story. You dont have to wonder about it; its referenced explicitly. Ambiguous endings have become something of a Nolan trademark and one can interpret The Dark Knight Rises final few scenes to be more or less optimistic depending on your personal inclination. This is nowhere near as maddening as the concluding image of Inception but neither is the resolution as clear-cut as it might initially seem. Theres no shortage of star power in the cast. Although no one achieves the level of ferocity exhibited by the late Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight Nolan wisely doesnt push his actors toward imitation. Bane is an entirely different sort of villain - hes smart but not sadistic yet capable of a brutality The Joker could not approach. A bulked-up Tom Hardy is almost unrecognizable behind the steel mask and his voice has been Darth Vaderized (making some lines of dialogue unintelligible). The Joker won Ledger a posthumous Oscar; Hardy wont be nominated. Its like comparing Alan Rickmans bad guy in Die Hard to the adequate generic one who followed in Die Hard 2. Bale has an opportunity to swap spit with two co-stars. He and Anne Hathaway click even though their ""romance"" never goes beyond the flirtatious stage. Things are frostier between the actor and Marion Cotillard who plays Miranda Tate Wayne Enterprises new CEO. Bruce and Miranda have sex in front of a fire but theres more heat coming from those flames than from their love affair. Michael Caine and Gary Oldman play more mournful versions of their familiar characters emphasizing the movies grimmer trajectory. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a welcome addition proving that it is possible to inject new blood into an established mythology as long as the new blood isnt represented by Shia LaBeouf. Those who attend superhero movies in search of goosebump moments may be disappointed to learn that despite running at nearly three hours The Dark Knight Rises has relatively few of these although those it offers are top-notch. Nolan rarely allows levity to intrude on his darkness and when it happens its often gallows humor. (Take for instance the best one liner which is delivered by Catwoman.) Hans Zimmers score is perfect for the material - not iconic but well-matched to the action. And Wally Pfister delivers some memorable images - the first shot I can remember of Lower Manhattan dominated by the new Freedom Tower (still under construction) and a helicopter shot of Batman that should be made into a poster. Having delivered his full Batman saga Nolan can move onto other projects content that he told the story he wanted to and did it to the best of his ability. Of the three movies The Dark Knight stands as the strongest. It is the most edgy and daring of the three and like The Empire Strikes Back it flies in the face of a common perception that middle chapter of a trilogy is the least rewarding. Looking at the finale The Dark Knight Rises is no Return of the Jedi. Its a more complete package without an Ewok in sight. It allows fans to leave the theater satiated and a little dazed and possibly wanting to see it again to catch everything they missed the first time. Yes there are flaws but The Dark Knight Rises gives this Batman trilogy a platform high atop the superhero pyramid from which it may never be dislodged.

"The bats back Brooding complicated Dark Knight uplifts a genre |       NJ.com comments The bats back Brooding complicated Dark Knight uplifts a genre Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on July 18 2012 at 1007 AM View/Post Comments Ron PhillipsChristian Bale as Batman in ""The Dark Knight Rises"" the final installment in the Christopher Nolan trilogy. In the world of Gotham City it has been eight years since Harvey Dent went mad since the Joker was defeated and since Batman -- accepting the blame protecting a dream -- disappeared into the shadows. Meanwhile in the world of fandom its been four years since ""The Dark Knight"" -- four years crammed with superhero extravaganzas increasingly sophisticated effects and nearly ubiquitous 3-D. But now its time. Time for Batman to return to crimefighting and face his greatest possibly final challenge. And time for ""The Dark Knight Rises"" to come to theaters and show audiences again how its really done. Christopher Nolans latest -- and last -- Batman film embraces wit while avoiding camp. It uses technology to create not just eye candy but wonder. And it eschews 3-D while embracing the modern immersiveness of IMAX and the classic virtues of contrast and composition. It is not quite ""The Dark Knight"" -- a film with a pointed political take on a world in crisis and a game-changing performance by Heath Ledger. But its a fitting climax to a trilogy that elevated a genre and helped erase at least some of the smirk once attached to ""superhero."" Behind the mask Of course Batman was always special. For millions of young comic fans Spider-Man reflected the person they were (awkward impulsive battling a rebelling body). Iron Man represented the person they dreamed of becoming (witty wealthy and with only the very best toys). But Batman represented something different darker more damaged. He was a man who lived in pain and dwelled in dark corners. And not because of a spider bite or gamma rays or some doctors experiment. Because he chose to. What sort of man would choose that? Thats always been at the center of the characters appeal Bruce Wayne of course wears a mask as Batman -- and that becomes a major theme in this concluding film. Sometimes the masks are literal -- like the domino ones that Selina Kyle sports or the crab-like device that Bane depends on. Sometimes they are metaphoric -- like the friendly smile that John Blake a Batman ally talks of assuming in an orphanage or the martyrdom that Commissioner Gordon awarded Harvey Dent. But they are always lies. And they are always escapes from a painful past. The movie starts awkwardly with one of those slam-bang action sequences -- a mid-flight kidnapping -- that in retrospect makes little sense. (Some master criminals really overthink things.) Then it switches to Gotham City where an arthritic Bruce Wayne has retired from public life -- and from private crimefighting. Its a bit of a slow start and a slightly confusing one (rewatching the last two movies before you see this one by the way isnt a bad idea; some smart theaters are even running them as a triple feature). But then cat burglar Selina -- her actual ""Catwoman"" persona is rather downplayed here -- appears and steals something very precious from Wayne. And then Bane comes to town -- a barrel-chested brilliant brute with apocalyptic plans. And its time for Batman to return. Politics and personalities Some of Nolans choices are debatable. Tom Hardys voice as Bane -- although not as muffled as in early trailers -- is oddly oracular (think Sean Connery minus the burr plus John Huston). His ultimate showdown with Batman also is slightly truncated. And the movies message is a bit muddled. ""The Dark Knight"" was about our new age of terror with the Joker -- who only wanted to ""watch the world burn"" -- standing in for Osama bin Laden and Waynes invasive use of surveillance meant to evoke the Patriot Act. Here though the points are more confused. At one point Banes attacks on Gotham City are rooted in Occupy Wall Street and militant Marxism; later they specifically reference the French Revolution. Yet at the same time Bane also simply wants to blow the city to smithereens. So what is he -- anarchist communist or apocalyptic madman? And then what in opposition is Bruce Wayne and how does the film interpret their conflict? Its unclear. But one doesnt -- shouldnt -- go to Batman films for clear political allegories (even though ""The Dark Knight"" provided one). One goes for melodrama and special-effects extravaganzas and some more-than-incidental good acting. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" has all three. The moody drama -- which mostly centers on Wayne and his grief over his lost love Rachel Dawes -- is intense. The toys -- which include the Batpod as well as a new flying machine the Bat -- are dazzling. But as is usual for a Nolan film its the acting thats the real special effect. Bale can be a problematic star -- handsome intense yet oddly withholding hes like a less-manic Tom Cruise -- yet hes a fine firm center here while selflessly ceding most of the big scenes to the supporting stars. Ron PhillipsAnne Hathaway in the Catwoman suit. And while fans have been arguing over Hardys performance since the first brief footage hit the internet Banes an interesting foil to Batman. Unlike the mad Joker he has a world view (or seems to for most of the film); hes bright (if self-educated) charismatic and physically imposing hes a true challenge. (And a much better choice for antagonist than the Riddler supposedly the early studio favorite.) Anne Hathaway meanwhile brings her own take to Catwoman -- more the wittily devious heroine of some caper movie (she even sports a big Audrey Hepburnesque hat in one scene) than super-sexy superhero. You miss the backstory that other incarnations of this character had but her confidence and fatal physicality (they dont call them stilettos for nothing) are nicely emphasized. Add in old favorites and a few fresh faces -- Marion Cotillard as Waynes new romance and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as his new police officer ally -- and you have a rich cast and quite a few surprises. (And fans should stop worrying about supposed spoilers and public rumors -- most are wrong and some seem to stem from a disinformation campaign so subtle the Soviets would have been envious.) ""The Dark Knight Rises"" isnt an easy superhero movie like the fun ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" or ""The Avengers"" which reliably delivered fan-friendly archetypes. It is through and through a Nolan movie -- a brooding complicated film that asks that you come to the theater prepared and that you watch the movie engaged. Is that too much to ask? Christopher Nolan thinks not. And his movies more than reward those who are willing to meet him on his terms. Ratings note The film contains violence and alcohol abuse. The Dark Knight Rises (PG-13) Warner Bros. (164 min.) Directed by Christopher Nolan. With Christian Bale Anne Hathaway Tom Hardy. Opens with midnight screenings on Friday morning.

This is as true of Inception with its reams of expositional walk-through as of Nolans superhero saga now swollen into a trilogy in which the dramatis personae are always stepping up to identify themselves in statements of principle. All of the on-the-nose speechifying (scripted by Nolan and his brother Jonathan) keeps the runtimes long while the drum-tight rule of schematic relevance shuts out anything resembling wit spontaneity and recognizable human conduct. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Billed as director Nolans final contribution to the franchise he revived with 2005s Batman Begins The Dark Knight Rises opens eight years after the events of 2008s The Dark Knight eight years after the death of Harvey Dent a/k/a Two-Face still honored as a hero through the print-the-legend contrivance of Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman returning) and eight years after the villainized fugitive Caped Crusader was last sighted in Gotham City which has settled into a fragile peace. Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) has hung up his Batman suit and become a Howard Hughes-like recluse only lured into the world again by a couple of women a socialite investor in Wayne Enterprises clean-energy programs Miranda (Marion Cotillard) and a cat burglar who penetrates his sanctuary Selina (Anne Hathaway repeatedly proving the ""No-Fun"" Nolans ability to make comic-relief one-liners fall flat amid their sepulchral master-builder cinema.)The overarching theme of the Batman films is the moral problem of vigilantism as played out by name-tagged figures of virtue and vice. ""The idea was to be a symbol"" Wayne says of his anonymous alter ego in The Dark Knight Rises--and so this most solemn of superhero franchises duly marches ahead with the process of ominous signification having established itself among those who accept its self-regard at face value as not just another blockbuster but the multiplex State of the Nation for the 21st century. If The Dark Knight openly invited interpretation as the War on Terror Batman then The Dark Knight Rises whose creators obviously scented the class discontent in the air is the Occupy Wall Street installment. ""You think all this can last?"" down-and-out survivor Selina says upon meeting Wayne at a fancy-dress masquerade ball. ""Theres a storm coming.""Film Details The Dark Knight Rises RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time164 More Info Trailer That storm breaks in the form of the living incarnation of Have-Not rancor Bane played by the hulking Tom Hardy face indistinguishable behind the ventilator apparatus clamped over his mouth. The visage will remind many of the unmasked Vader though his fruity magniloquent purr is closer to Vincent Price talking through a window fan.Bane was ""born and raised in hell on earth""--a pit prison on the other side of the world. In order to punch in Banes weight class the softened fresh-out-of-retirement Wayne will first have to join the 99 Percent eventually enrolling in the same third-world school of hard knocks that spawned his opponent. Training in dismal prehistoric conditions trims away the fat of techie decadence and reinvigorates Waynes sense of the ethical obligation of privilege. If this sounds familiar its because Wayne did a similar piece of slumming in Batman Begins. It is also the theme of Rocky IV.As in The Dark Knights conflict between Wayne and the Joker Order versus Anarchy the face-off between Wayne and Bane is a dialectical battle between personified concepts. Wayne is Gotham Citys philanthropic chaperone; his company develops technologies with great potential for help and harm which Wayne then keeps away from a polis that he protects without trusting. Bane is in posture at least a radical revolutionist setting himself up as the champion of the disenfranchised though it is difficult to imagine who would be seduced by his tactics or his plan ""to return control of the city to the people"" followed by the neutralization of law and order and the foundation of a Gotham Commune.For the Nolans it is characters who voice seemingly utopian goals such as ""restoring balance to the world"" of whom the most is to be feared. And while The Dark Knights climax hinged on finding faith in the common mans decency upon witnessing the goings-on in Occupied Gotham it is impossible to imagine this revolution accomplishing anything decent--the citizens tribunal kangaroo court a fantastic production design flourish by Nathan Crowley is Reign of Terror by way of Kafka while a parody of the Bastille is played out before Blackgate Penitentiary. The Dark Knight Rises is not a reactionary movie outright--it would be more respectable if it were--but only on a villainous technicality. The perpetrators of the city-upending mutiny have no interest in a new order only in seeing Gotham purged in blood with a rote ticking time bomb an apocalypse that precludes the possibility of revolution either failing or succeeding on its own terms.The Dark Knight Rises is a shallow repository of ideas but as a work of sheer sensation it has something to recommend. At two hours and 45 minutes its no fleeter of foot than its plodding predecessors but Nolan has continued his experimentation with the IMAX format and the sheer mass of what he has constructed inspires a dull awe--it is impossible not to be cowed by a film thats five stories tall while Hans Zimmers stampeding orchestra tramples you. As throughout the Batman films Nolan is at his best symphonizing second-unit footage illustrating how the shock waves of an assault resound across the infrastructure of an entire city a coordinated attack on Gothams pressure points being a particular highlight here. (The city is composed of bits of Pittsburgh and Los Angeles with New York City for establishing shots including a half-complete new WTC tower available for suggestive effect.) The history of Batmans burden is however increasingly cumbersome and its Mr. Bane who finally makes the pertinent point ""Gotham is beyond saving and must be allowed to die.""1 Even the rich-guy-standing-around scenes are grim.Ron Phillips Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Nick Pinkerton Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Sometimes it works but often it doesnt and the honest interaction of characters is ground under the wheels of storytelling necessity. See for example butler Alfred Pennyworths (Michael Caine) sudden realization that being Batman (Christian Bale) is a life-threatening business or good cop John Blakes (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) life choices after realizing the moral complexities of his profession. The film might feel like an elaborate and intricate chess strategem - seemingly scattered movements gradually converging on a final concentrated masterstroke - except for a few plot points that not even the grandest of masters could predict. See for example Police Commissioner Gordons (Gary Oldman) decision to lead a manhunt through the sewer while carrying a document full of sensitive secrets in his jacket pocket. The baddie this time is Bane (Tom Hardy) a brutal and brutalized soul - born in prison exiled from the same League of Shadows that trained Bruce Wayne in Batman Begins but still bent on completing the Leagues mission to destroy a corrupt Gotham schoolchildren and orphans included. (The citys current offense the Dent Act a tough law that has helped to rid Gotham of crime but possibly at the expense of justice.) Oh and Catwoman (Anne Hathaway) a pretty thief who cant seem to outrun her past. Philosophy abounds Bane is fond of the soul-body dichotomy Batman has to learn a few new things about his old friend fear and there is insightful talk of real despair requiring a modicum of hope. But some of it gets mangled in Banes mask-hindered speech and some of it is just mangled to begin with. (After handing Gotham over to ""the people"" Bane begins giving orders and shedding blood. O HAI FRENCH REVOLUTION.) All that said there is plenty of Bat-goodness here. Bane is genuinely scary Batmans fall (and rise) are convincing and the whole thing draws from the first and second installments in satisfying ways. Plus you know cool weapons/modes of transport. And Batman. Reader rating one star. Click for showtimes.

""The Dark Knight Rises"" while offering all the thrills and brooding and shadows and angst and adrenaline and grandiloquence that fans of Christopher Nolans Batman trilogy will no doubt be expecting from this final entry comes up short in only one department the shock of the new. This time around Nolan (who co-wrote with his brother Jonathan) doesnt rewrite the rules; he lives up to his own previous standards without exceeding them. Whereas his two previous films offered continuous jolts of discovery ""Rises"" for all its unquestionable virtues winds up enhancing the Nolan brand but rarely expanding it. Still given the reputation hes created simple excellence by Christopher Nolan standards is pretty terrific. Also read Dark Knight Rises to Detective Comics Batman Through the Years (Slideshow) ""Rises"" begins eight years after ""The Dark Knight"" with Batman gone from the scene Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) in seclusion and Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) still publicly revering the image of the late District Attorney Harvey Dent as a way to pass tougher laws against organized crime and to put more people in jail. Not that Gotham City is completely crime-free of course; during a reception at Wayne Manor honoring the anniversary of Dents death (the lord of the house remains lurking in the shadows) cat burglar Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) slinks upstairs dressed as a housemaid and makes off with a pearl necklace belonging to Bruces late mother. Wayne will soon have bigger problems with the arrival of a hulking mercenary known as Bane (Tom Hardy) a brute whose voice is amplified through the breathing device always clamped onto his face. Bane at first seems to be in cahoots with a board member at Wayne Enterprises who wants to destroy Bruces personal fortunes and to take over the company (Selina has a hand in this as well) but it eventually becomes clear that this fearsome assassin has a deadlier agenda of his own involving the nuclear reactor at the heart of Bruces clean-energy project. But even if Bruce feels the need to put the pointed ears back on resuming his life as Batman will be no easy feat. His doctor (an uncredited Thomas Lennon of all people) informs Bruce that hes basically got no cartilage left in his knees and shoulders but Bruce straps a motorized brace on his leg and goes to town. Butler Alfred (Michael Caine) refuses to stick around to watch his employer die fighting but weapons genius Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) continues to help out while Bruce finds new allies in John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) a cop orphaned by violence in the same way Bruce was and Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard) who becomes Wayne Enterprises new CEO. Nolan takes the franchise to places that are arguably darker than ""The Dark Knight"" and not just in terms of Wally Pfisters beautifully murky cinematography. Bane not only wipes out the finances of Bruce Wayne but he shatters literally Batmans body leaving him in a prison thats the equivalent of being trapped at the bottom of a well. But just when ""The Dark Knight Rises"" feels like it might take audiences to places it might not want to go the director falls back on convention albeit convention delivered with true flair. (The films climax may involve the millionth ticking-time-bomb-with-a-red-LED-display youve seen but dang if he doesnt make that sequence thrilling.) Also read First Dark Knight Rises Reviews Holy Hyperbole Batman In many ways Bane is a thankless role for the talented Hardy. Not only does he have to spend the entire film with most of his face hidden and his voice distorted hes got the unenviable task of stepping into the void left by Heath Ledgers indelible Joker. And while the Jokers name is never once spoken in ""Rises"" his presence and his absence both cover the film like a shroud. Perhaps its because ""The Dark Knight Rises"" so desperately needs some occasional comic relief but its Hathaways Selina Kyle (Catwoman in deed if not in name) who shockingly steals the show. Shes dangerous and brutal sophisticated and slippery -- imagine Audrey Hepburn as Irma Vep. Gordon-Levitt takes what could have been a flatly earnest flatfoot and imbues him with a real sense of purpose and passion; the films final frames imply that we havent seen the last of this character and thats a good thing. It will be interesting to see what hay political pundits decide to make of this film which doesnt seem to have any particular ideologies in mind. Nonetheless dont be surprised if left-leaning commentators seize on the notion of prisons being packed under false pretenses while those on the right note that an oppressed Gotham City being held hostage by Bane resembles an anti-Soviet propaganda film complete with show trials poor masses huddling by open fires in office lobbies and rich people being thrown out of their homes while gun-toting thugs roam the streets. (And like ""The Avengers"" ""The Dark Knight Rises"" features a clean-energy system being turned into a weapon by the bad guys. Somewhere the Koch Brothers are editing a clip reel.) The ending wont be revealed here -- too bad the Nolans werent as scrupulous as they telegraph it like crazy throughout. Suffice it to say that for all the provocative choices that ""The Dark Knight Rises"" makes the bomb with the red numbers isnt the films only flirtation with conventionality. As trilogy wrap-ups go ""Rises"" wont raise the fanboy hackles of say ""Return of the Jedi"" but neither will it feel like the revelation of ""The Dark Knight."" Breaking News To Your Inbox.

"The Dark Knight Rises review Cape fear | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Dark Knight Rises review Cape fearThe Dark Knight Rises is not just the summers grandest blockbuster but also one of the years best movies.Christian Bale adds more brooding to his Batpod-riding superhero in The Dark Knight Rises.  (Ron Phillips / Warner Bros. Pictures)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticTues. July 17 2012The Dark Knight Rises(out of 4)Starring Christian Bale Tom Hardy Anne Hathaway Michael Caine Gary Oldman Morgan Freeman Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Marion Cotillard. Directed by Christopher Nolan. 164 minutes. Opens at midnight on July 19 at major theatres. PGFear is the word in The Dark Knight Rises the concluding chapter of Christopher Nolans outstanding Batman origin trilogy.Its in the eyes of both hero and villain in all its manifestations -- from anxiety and doubt right up to sheer terror.Article Continued BelowIts constantly on their lips as when new arch-villain Bane tells one of his victims ""Nows not the timeforfear. That comes later.""Genuine fear is an emotion you dont often get in summer blockbusters which tend to be all about the swagger conferred by superpowers and absurd scenarios.Not this trilogy and especially not this movie which incorporates human frailty and realistic threats of nuclear and economic destruction into the densely layered saga co-written by Nolan with his brother Jonathan and David S. Goyer. The film receives its Canadian premiere Wednesday night with regular screenings commencing midnight Thursday.This Knight not only rises it also cuts deep -- not just as spectacular entertainment but also as harrowing drama.Its eight years past the traumatic events of The Dark Knight (2008) and Batman is for all intents and purposes no more. Hes been outlawed and ostracized in Gotham City which arrogantly believes it has rid itself of major crime.Wrongly blamed for the demise of Gothams public defender Harvey Dent a lie that even trusted ally Police Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) is unhappily and politically obliged to maintain Batman -- or rather his alter-ego Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) -- hides inside stately Wayne Manor. Mourning losses both tangible and emotional he lacks the anger that sparked his heroic creation in Batman Begins (2005) when he adopted the sign of the bat as his symbol of fear vanquishing evil.Wayne is also physically diminished and now walks with a cane.He just wants to check out of the world.But Gotham City still has an interest in what happened to him. A lot of people want to know who Batman was if only to exact revenge.And a new threat has emerged a super terrorist by the name of Bane (Tom Hardy) probably the most vile and fearsome foe that Batman has ever faced. Indeed that any hero has ever faced.Built like a wrestling giant Bane wears a mask that resembles a spider or perhaps the ""face hugger"" from the Alien series. Worn through painful necessity the mask hides his mouth but not his piercing eyes ferocious intellect or unsettling voice. He proclaims himself to be ""Gothams reckoning.""Gothams destruction seems more likely. Bane plans to weaponize a nuclear fusion device that Wayne Enterprises developed for peaceful means. The tables turn evils way in an eye-popping airborne prologue and in a daring raid on the citys stock exchange.If its at all possible Bane is even more nihilistic than Heath Ledgers Joker from The Dark Knight. And while it would be almost impossible to top the late Ledgers incendiary performance which won him a posthumous Best Supporting Actor Oscar Hardys Bane comes awfully close. Hes mesmerizing on the screen recalling Darth Vader in the original Star Wars.Christian Bales finely drawn Batman meanwhile is a darker and more brooding character than weve seen in past outings. Its an understated performance by Bale but quite possibly his best.Two welcome female characters join the cast. Anne Hathaway intrigues and wows as cat burglar Selina Kyle a.k.a. Catwoman who has connections to both Bane and Batman. Shes brutally funny a little frightening and incredibly athletic in her skin-tight leathers filling the screen as one of the most dynamic femmes seen in a long time. Marion Cotillard makes less noise as Gotham tycoon Miranda Tate but she fits very well into the intricate puzzle that is The Dark Knight Rises.So too does Joseph Gordon-Levitt another newcomer who like Cotillard and Hardy hails from Nolans previous film Inception. Gordon-Levitt plays good cop John Blake an aide to Commissioner Gordon who is such an old-school lawman he rounds up street kids to help him spread the word about the threats to Gotham.There are also many familiar faces in The Dark Knight Rises including two that function best as discoveries.But another two cant be left unmentioned Michael Caine as Waynes loyal butler Alfred and Morgan Freeman as company gadget man Lucius Fox who supplements the Batmobile and Bat-Pod motorbike with a supercool flying machine simply called The Bat.As before Caine and Freeman serve as father figures but Caines role takes on added nuances that make him the films emotional heart and also the first amongst equals for a likely slew of Academy Awards nominations.Blockbusters arent supposed to be this brainy in the summer. Youre supposed to switch your brain off and just roll with it which is essentially what The Avengers did earlier this summer. It was a fun movie but not a deep one.The Dark Knight Rises is soul-deep. It prompts us look at our most private fears and how we cope with them. It questions what happens if we give into those fears.Its a demanding movie one that could leave you exhausted as well as exhilarated during its nearly three-hour running time which is perhaps a shade longer than the film needs to be.But we can forgive a few script excesses because were invested in all the characters.And if all else fails just sit back and marvel at the IMAX images which comprise nearly 50 per cent of the film -- and do make the effort to see this on an IMAX screen.Nolan aims to capture our minds and also to dazzle our eyes and he succeeds admirably on both counts.The Dark Knight Rises is not just the summers grandest blockbuster but also one of the years best movies.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

It has been eight years since Batman (Christian Bale) in collusion with Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) vanished into the night. Assuming responsibility for the death of Harvey Dent Batman sacrificed everything for what he and Gordon hoped would be the greater good. However the arrival of a cunning cat burglar (Anne Hathaway) and a merciless terrorist named Bane (Tom Hardy) force Batman out of exile and into a battle he may not be able to win.

No other movie that year got my blood pumping and put my emotions through a roller coaster ride like Christopher Nolans epic conclusion to his Batman saga. Where the Dark Knight was dark and depressing The Dark Knight Rises is action-packed and full of redemption. Im not saying that was a flaw in The Dark Knight (especially during the first watch) but after watching it so many times it can wear you down how dark it is. It is simply not as enjoyable of a movie to me than this one. The Dark Knight is certainly the best made Batman and superhero movie made to date but The Dark Knight Rises to me takes everything that worked so far for Nolan and ratchets it up to 10. This is still thoughtful blockbuster film making just with a more ambitious and epic scope than the previous two which in itself will present some flaws the other two did not have. While there is no iconic Oscar worthy performance like that of Heath Ledger as the Joker Tom Hardy as Bane is still great and the rest of the returning cast are as good as they have always been. The other newcomer Anne Hathaway as Catwoman is also good and keeps the film in the realistic tone that Nolan has established since Batman Begins. The Dark Knight Rises is not the best film in Nolans Batman saga but it is definitely my favorite.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreAug 9 2012TuxFeaturedGreat review for a very disappointing film. I also had high hopes for Nolans Batman run after The Dark Knights Chaos versus Order narrative. Unfortunately Nolan wasted a really great opportunity by twisting a promising A Tale of Two Cities inspired story into a shallow comic book save-the-city-from-destruction outing. In fact it was not even pretentious but just another comic book fluff film with a frantic pace and some decent effects. I did enjoy the overpowering sound though and felt that it contributed most to the sense of anxiety the film wished to produce. Why Nolan? Why did you fail us? Perhaps well have better luck with Zack Snyders Superman run. However if Nolan failed at lifting comic book films to new heights I fear Snyder (who basically adapts comics to film frame-by-frame) have even less of a chance at success... but lets hope.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreAug 3 2012The Wisdom CowFeaturedYou wouldnt even know a naked man in a tree if his name was YossarianHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJul 21 2012Melvin WhiteFeaturedThe last two paragraphs of this review are depressingly accurate.

Not once but several times in the course of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" Alfred implores the angst-ridden Bruce Wayne to move on get a life and find happiness. His appeals are genuinely moving inevitably unavailing and beside the point. Gotham City needs Batman. Time Warner needs Batman. The world has waited four years to find out how the Batman saga resolves. And feeling good about life is not what Christian Bales Batman wants. This third--and the director insists final--installment of Mr. Nolans series makes you feel thoroughly miserable about life. Its spectacular to be sure but also remarkable for its all-encompassing gloom. No movie has ever administered more punishment to its hero or its audience in the name of mainstream entertainment. Bruce can be forgiven the bleakness of his initial mood. His caped alter ego was unjustly blamed for the death of Gotham Citys district attorney Harvey Dent who was anything but the model citizen hes become in public memory. Now the billionaire socialite has turned antisocial a Howard Hughes-like hermit (minus the screwiness) licking his psychic wounds and living with the all-too-real injuries of former battles. But two threats conspire to end his solitude. ENLARGE Christian Bale and Anne Hathaway in The Dark Knight Rises Ron Phillips / (c) Warner Bros. / Courtesy Everett Collection One of them is brought home--into his own home--by Anne Hathaways Selina Kyle aka Catwoman. Its intriguingly difficult to discern her motives or loyalties for most of the movie. The conventional rewards of cat-burgling dont justify her dangerous exertions. Whats clear from the start though is that Ms. Hathaways zestful performance gives the film some sorely needed grace notes. She rolls her eyes ever so slightly when an earnest cop says the Gotham PD can offer her protection. She alternates Catwomans rubber-suited athleticism with Selinas demure ladylike gait and whispers the scripts most haunting words into Bruces ear. They begin as the trailer reveals with ""Theres a storm coming Mr. Wayne"" and end with ""youre all going to wonder how you could ever live so large and leave so little for the rest of us."" Many critics are praising the new Batman movie ""The Dark Knight Rises"" and WSJs Chris Farley has one good piece of advice for viewers. (Photo AP) If that sounds like a comment on economic inequality it surely is; one of the big action sequences is a terrorist attack on the Gotham City Stock Exchange. But the most proximate source of the threatening storm is Bane--an implacable bemuscled villain who wears a mask over his disfigured face and who speaks in muffled tones that make Darth Vader sound like an elocution teacher. (Hes not the only one with intelligibility problems; the movies use of bass frequencies to convey threat and evil does for dialogue what amped-up rock does for lyrics.) As played by the excellent Tom Hardy who has porked up for the role and is essentially unrecognizable Bane is not merely evil enough but ambitious enough to bring Batman back into action since he plans nothing less than the citys enslavement if not its total destruction. Mr. Nolan who wrote the screenplay with his brother Jonathan Nolan is an urbanist in a class by himself. He conjured up whole cities in ""Inception"" only to turn them inside out or make them vanish in a flash. Here he gives us a vision of a great citys dismemberment at the hands of a brute and his terrorist army--a shattering vision that extends from Gothams subterranean tunnels to its tallest towers and proudest landmarks. (Ill mention just one effect which also appears in the trailer so Im giving nothing away--a football player running the ball in a huge stadium without realizing that underground explosions are devouring the field behind him.) Watch the new trailer for the third and final installment of the Dark Knight series from director Christopher Nolan. . Its hardly news but worth repeating that the filmmaker and his production teammates do breathtaking work theyre headed by the cinematographer Wally Pfister and the production designers Nathan Crowley and Kevin Kavanaugh. And it goes without saying that the staggering commercial success of the previous two films will be matched or exceeded by this one which brings back Gary Oldman as police commissioner Jim Gordon as well as Morgan Freeman as Bruce Waynes armorer Lucius Fox while adding two significant characters to the cast Marion Cotillards Miranda Tate a beautiful philanthropist and member of the Wayne Enterprises executive board who helps bring Bruce out of his existential funk (""You have a practiced apathy"" she tells him for openers); and Joseph Gordon-Levitts John Blake a young cop with extraordinary instincts--beyond extraordinary at one plot point--whose likable presence is a breath of fresh air and who does some serious sleuthing on his own when Batman isnt available to take charge of a desperate situation.

""The Dark Knight Rises"" is notable for many things--thrilling chases supercool vehicles majestic vistas an epic scale that hasnt been achieved since ""The Lord of the Rings"" a redemptive climax that brings an end more or less to a complex saga. The most stunning thing about the film though--and this is said not by way of praise but with anxious wonderment--is how depressing and truly doomy most of it is. Batman played by a marvelous actor with a singular gift for depicting pain suffers mortally. Drums beat incessantly--before during and after a series of numbing Neanderthal brawls between Batman and Bane. History takes a double beating from a script that reprocesses the storming of the Bastille into an attack by terrorist thugs. Dark comic books have always been around but with a difference; as pictures and words on paper theyve allowed readers to choose their own degree of involvement. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" allows no choice; its immersive and assaultive to a degree that could only have been achieved by the conjunction of a quintessentially somber comic and a filmmaker with a complementary sensibility marshaling the vast technical and financial resources of an entertainment conglomerate. During the Great Depression moviegoers flocked to escapist films with glittering dancers happy endings and upbeat songs like ""Happy Days Are Here Again."" For whatever this movie may say about todays world it rises to a different occasion and dances to a different tune. Happy days are done and gone. The Queen of Versailles The new documentary Queen of Versailles"" chronicles David and Jacqueline Siegels attempt to build a 90000 square foot private home in Orlando Florida and the financial and personal turmoil that results from the economic downturn. WSJs Wendy Bounds spoke with director Lauren Greenfield on the family American excess and the house itself. That speech in the Batman movie about living so large could have been a perfect fit for Lauren Greenfields deliciously appalling documentary about the billionaire couple who built the biggest house in America then went bust after the 2008 crash. In the case of David and Jackie Siegel large means the 90000 square feet of an Orlando home named Versailles--a real-estate broker trying to sell the unfinished monstrosity pronounces it Ver-sighs--because it was inspired in part by the even less cozy chateau in France. (The other source of inspiration was the top floor of the Paris Hotel in Las Vegas.) Why would anyone need so much Lebensraum? Because the Siegels along with their children nannies maids dogs lizards a python and enough possessions to fill a Wal-Mart couldnt contain themselves within the 26000 square feet of their starter mansion. ""No place like home"" the man of the house says with appropriate expansiveness while seated on a sort of gilded throne. When the Siegels agreed to be filmed they were sitting on top of a world that promised to keep spinning at the same giddy rate. He was making huge amounts of money by using high-pressure techniques to sell timeshare vacation homes. She was spending huge amounts of money with unquenchable gusto. Seeing them at the peak of their prosperity its easy to empathize with Jackie; she enjoys her life--her bedroom looks like a pillow factory--and loves her husband and seven kids. David is less than lovable as he presents himself to the camera. He boasts of having changed many lives ""A lot of people are better off for having known me."" He claims personal responsibility for having gotten George W. Bush elected president though he doesnt explain how because he says it might not have been legal. He insists that everyone wants to be or at least wants to feel rich ""If they dont want to feel rich theyre probably dead."" Its the filmmakers good fortune--and certainly to her subjects credit--that the Siegels allowed her to keep filming in the aftermath of 2008 as Davids business empire came crashing down. They are not as you might guess as interesting to watch in relative poverty as in obscene wealth and the poverty part goes on much too long--not just for them but for us watching them. Yet their lives take on a surreal and eerily fascinating squalor. Little white dogs poop all over the carpets. A pet lizard dies for lack of water. Jackie the more resilient spouse--or the slower learner--keeps buying stuff and stuffing the stuff into minivans. But David working in his library amid Dickensian piles of documents turns tyrannical and falls into a funk thats both painful and instructive to behold. While acknowledging his own addiction to cheap money he denounces the predatory tactics of the banks yet never breathes a word about the predatory sales practices on which his fortune was built. ""Nothing makes me happy these days"" he laments sounding shaken and looking gaunt. Its a film that makes you count your blessings.  A note about the perils of being a movie critic in the age of polarized fandom. Speakeasy The Dark Knight Rises Raises Ugly Debate on Rotten Tomatoes I may have saved my life without realizing it by liking ""The Dark Knight Rises"" sufficiently--or disliking it with sufficient restraint--to have my review categorized as ""ripe"" rather than ""rotten"" on Rotten Tomatoes a popular website that aggregates movie and DVD reviews. For those of us who write about movies to provoke discussion these reductive categories are awfully silly but theyre also symptoms of the love/hate either/or ethos of contemporary discourse. In the realm of the Internet as well as talk-radio and politics that discourse has been growing ever more poisonous and now the poison has contaminated Rotten Tomatoes. Earlier this week the website was forced to shut down its user comments on ""The Dark Knight Rises"" when negative reviews--officially adjudged ""rotten""--by two of my colleagues Christy Lemire and Marshall Fine provoked floods of vile responses that included death threats. Batman movies may be a bit of a special case what with fanatical fanboys trolling the Internet to root out negative opinions of their supersolemn hero. But the Dark Knights acolytes dont have a monopoly on intolerance of dissent. Theyre part of a rising tide that threatens to drown Internet discussion in shrill opinion. The editors of Rotten Tomatoes have the right to excise such clearly intolerable comments and the responsibility to improve procedures for screening out new ones. Once thats done however the comments function should be fully restored. Free speech for the many shouldnt fall victim to abuse by the few.

View Comments Print By CHRISTY LEMIRE - Associated Press - Monday July 16 2012 Christopher Nolan concludes his Batman trilogy in typically spectacular ambitious fashion with ""The Dark Knight Rises"" but the feeling of frustration and disappointment is unshakable.Maybe that was inevitable. Maybe nothing could have met the expectations established by 2008s ""The Dark Knight"" which revolutionized and set the standard for films based on comic books by being both high-minded and crowd-pleasing. With Christian Bale as his tortured superhero starting from 2005s ""Batman Begins"" Nolan has explored the complicated and conflicting motivations of man as well as the possibility of greatness and redemption within society.Here as director and co-writer hes unrelenting in hammering home the dread the sorrow the sense of detachment and futility of a city on the brink of collapse with no savior in sight. Gotham is under siege in ways that tonally and visually recall 9/11; what is obviously the island of Manhattan gets cut off from the outside world at one point. Rather than seeming exploitative its just one of many examples of the script from Nolan and his usual collaborator his brother Jonathan making the franchise feel like a relevant reflection of our times. Identity theft economic collapse and an uprising of the disgruntled disenfranchised have-nots against the smug comfy haves also come into play.Theres so much going on here though with so many new characters who are all meant to function in significant ways that ""The Dark Knight Rises"" feels overloaded and sadly lacking the spark that gave 2008s ""The Dark Knight"" such vibrancy. The absence of Heath Ledger who won a posthumous Oscar for his portrayal of the anarchic and truly frightening Joker is really obvious here. It retrospect it makes you realize how crucial Ledgers performance was in making that Batman movie fly.By comparison ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is plot-heavy obsessed with process laden with expository dialogue and flashbacks that bog down the momentum and _ dare I say it? _ just flat-out boring at times. Yes the Batman world through Nolans eyes is supposed to be moody and introspective; youve got to admire the fact that he is willing to challenge us this way when summer blockbusters so often feel flashy and hollow. And yet at the same time it takes some giant leaps with its characters which either make no sense havent earned the emotions theyre seeking or both.""The Dark Knight Rises"" does feature the kind of impeccable production values weve come to expect from Nolans films; many members of his core team are back including cinematographer Wally Pfister editor Lee Smith and production designers Nathan Crowley and Kevin Kavanaugh. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" feels weighty and substantive _ and thankfully isnt in 3-D _ but it takes on an even grittier look than its predecessors as Gotham City devolves into desperation and ruin.But Nolans approach is so coldly cerebral that its a detriment to the films emotional core. Its all doom and gloom and no heart. There is no reason to care about these characters who function more as cogs in an elaborate chaotic machine than as real people whose souls are at stake.Its been four years since ""The Dark Knight"" came out but eight years have passed in terms of story. Bales Bruce Wayne suffers in self-imposed exile sulking about Wayne Manor mourning the loss of his darling Rachel and carrying the burden of blame for the death of District Attorney Harvey Dent. His goal of a peaceful Gotham has been achieved but hes left as a man without a purpose. Michael Caine as the ever-loyal valet Alfred brings dignity and eloquence to the film as he begs Bruce to carve out his own form of happiness. Fellow veterans Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon and Morgan Freeman as gadget guru Lucius Fox are their usual dignified selves but they dont register the way they should because the film is so overstuffed.Several new characters manage to draw Bruce out of his funk in various ways. Anne Hathaway brings some much needed zest to the proceedings as Selina Kyle otherwise known as Catwoman in the Batman universe a slinky thief who punctures Bruces bubble when she lifts his fingerprints from his safe along with a beloved pearl necklace. Shes selfish and cynical only looking out for herself but at least she goes about her crimes with some verve and style. They never call her Catwoman by name and shes never as campy as Michelle Pfeiffer and Halle Berry were in previous film incarnations of the role but shes always fun to watch.The other woman in Bruces life however is woefully underdeveloped _ which is a real problem because she plays a key role in the films climactic revelations. Marion Cotillard (one of many alumni from Nolans ""Inception"") co-stars as Miranda Tate a wealthy philanthropist who hopes to work with Wayne Enterprises on developing clean sustainable energy. The romance that develops between her and Bruce is utterly unbelievable.Joseph Gordon-Levitt adds a youthful presence as John Blake an up-and-coming member of the police force who inspires Bruce to revisit his own childhood as an orphan. Gordon-Levitt as solid as always but theres not much to his character aside from earnestness.Then theres Bane a muscular mass of pure evil who orchestrates an elaborate takeover of Gotham City. The role is a huge waste of what Tom Hardy can do; his character is so one-dimensional and poorly defined hes never so much a fearsome figure as a large and hulking one. It doesnt help matters that its often difficult to make out what hes saying beneath the cage-like muzzle that covers his nose and mouth and alters his voice. Hardy can be sexy and charismatic (as he proved in ""Inception"") but also a dangerous and unpredictable figure. None of that is on display here. Hes all brute force.But he is the instigator of the films dazzling opening sequence worthy of the best of James Bond a daring aerial maneuver in which Bane kidnaps a scientist by hijacking his plane from the skies above. Thats probably the most effective of the many set pieces Nolan stages here although the collapse of Heinz Field during a packed football game also has an urgent visceral quality with thrills that recall the most imaginative moments of ""Inception.""This is the problem when youre an exceptional visionary filmmaker. When you give people something extraordinary they expect it every time. Anything short of that feels like a letdown.""The Dark Knight Rises"" a Warner Bros. release is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action some sensuality and language.

A gang of thugs has just looted the Gotham City Stock Exchange and crashed out on motorcycles hostages in tow. The police are helpless as they pursue the miscreants into a tunnel. Suddenly the tunnel goes dark. A familiar vehicle with monster-truck wheels driven by a man in black cape and cowl has joined the chase. Batman is back. An older cop observes the action smiles and says to a rookie ""Boy youre in for a show tonight son."" The Dark Knight Rises (TDKR) Christopher Nolans mesmerizing climax to his trilogy reboot of the DC Comics character is a show all right. But not in the way of the standard summer action fantasy. Although his movie contains elaborate fights stunts chases and war toys and though the director dresses half his characters in outfits suitable for a Comic-Con revel Nolan is a dead-serious artist with a worldview many shades darker than the knight of the title. The Avengers is kid stuff compared with this meditation on mortal loss and heroic frailty. For once a melodrama with pulp origins convinces viewers that it can be the modern equivalent to Greek myths or a Jonathan Swift satire. TDKR is that big that bitter -- a film of grand ambitions and epic achievement. The most eagerly anticipated movie of summer 2012 was worth waiting for. (MORE Holy Bat Trivia 10 Things You Didnt Know About Batman) Reuniting the core crew from his 2005 Batman Begins and the 2008 The Dark Knight -- Christian Bale as Batman/Bruce Wayne Michael Caine as his butler Alfred Gary Oldman as police commissioner Jim Gordon and Morgan Freeman as the entrepreneur Lucius Fox -- Nolan has created new roles for four of the actors from his 2010 hit Inception. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays the resourceful cop John Blake; Tom Hardy is Bane the monster who would bring Gotham to its knees; Marion Cotillard is the philanthropist Miranda Tate; Cillian Murphy who also played the Scarecrow in Batman Begins returns as a hanging judge as the city explodes in chaos. And Anne Hathaway creeps in and out as Selina Kyle a.k.a. Catwoman. Eight years after he dispatched the Joker (Heath Ledger) and took the rap for killing Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) the idealistic district attorney who had become the villainous Two-Face Bruce lives morose and secluded in Wayne Manor seen only by Alfred. Gotham appears at peace with no organized crime surfacing. By theres at least one gifted solo artist. Selina in maids garb manages to pick Bruces private safe making off with his fingerprints and a necklace she has the gall and style to wear. The theft stirs Bruce out of his torpor and he shows up at a charity ball hosted by Miranda. Selina momentarily Bruces dance partner tells him ""Theres a storm coming Mr. Wayne. You and your friends better batten down the hatches cause when it hits youre all gonna wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little for the rest of us."" (MORE To Catch a Thief The Evolution of Catwoman) The form of the storm is a creature called Bane an immense hulk with an air of courtly menace and to reduce his pain a tubular mask that looks like a small creature from the original Alien permanently leeched onto his face. Long ago Bane escaped from a deep Asian pit where tough men were left to wither and die. Now he is the muscle and possibly the brains of the League of Shadows from Batman Begins. And he has a master plan to free -- read enslave -- Bruces city employing the ability to cloud mens minds by lightly touching their heads and even more effective a four-megaton nuclear device. ""Im Gothams reckoning"" Bane proclaims. ""Im the borrowed time youve all been living on."" And to ensure that the debilitated Batman wont get in the way he leaves Bruce in the hellhole Bane grew up in. To clarify some of the plot elements in TDKR take a refresher glance at Batman Begins. That first movie begins with the young Bruce in his garden with his lifelong love Rachel Dawes falling down a deep well into a pit that for a child was as terrifying as the pit Bane consigns him to. Worse because out of the darkness fly a flock of bats. (Hence Bruces fear; hence his creation of the Batman doppelganger to conquer that fear.) As a young man he is drafted by the mysterious Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson) into training for the League of Shadows an elite cadre of militant do-gooders -- anyway doers -- whose Shadow in Chief is Ras al Ghul. The first of many father figures for Bruce Ducard appears again in TDKR. So do other plot strands an ice pond that must be crossed the sealing off of Gothams bridges the jacket of Bruces dead father that Jim Gordon drapes on the shoulders of a poor little rich boy. (PHOTOS Dark Knight Rides The Complete History of the Batmobile) As a boy in Batman Begins he saw his parents murdered by a street thief; those deaths triggered his vigilante vengeance. As a man in The Dark Knight he lost Rachel in an explosion; that death sent him into his eight-year seclusion devotedly tended by his servant and surrogate parent Alfred. But Bruce is not the only TDKR character in a prolonged state of bereavement. John Blakes father also a policeman was killed the night Harvey Dent died. Another character the offspring of one of Batmans earlier nemeses tells him ""I could not forgive my father until you murdered him."" All these grownup children are members of the Dead Parents Society; all are emotional orphans. Crippled by personal tragedy then forged into something more durable and dangerous Bruce John and the rest express or repress their true nature by playing roles donning masks. ""No one cared who I was"" Bane says through his respirator ""until I put on the mask."" John who feels a filial kinship to Batman recalls his days in an orphanage ""You get to learn to hide the anger practice smiling in a mirror. Its like wearing a mask."" Selina hides in plain sight wearing her Catwoman frock at a society ball. When Bruce says ""Thats a brazen costume for a cat burglar"" she asks ""Yeah? Who are you pretending to be?"" He replies ""Bruce Wayne eccentric billionaire."" When does the pretense become the persona and the persona the person? (MORE Batman Is Back -- TIME Reviews The Dark Knight) Nolans mask is his guise as a director of comic-book entertainments when hes really out to excoriate American greed and laziness and its citizens susceptibility to a demagogues threats and promises. Bane -- who could be Osama bin Laden with Darth Vaders voice in ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austins body -- convinces or cows virtually the whole city with his harangues. (Hes a very verbose dictator.) In TDRK the mayor is smug the deputy police commissioner is weak the government eager to lock up suspects without trials the Gotham rabble eager to loot the penthouses of the wealthy when Bane declares the city liberated. ""This was someones home"" says Selena briefly stricken by conscience as the mob trashes a Fifth Avenue mansion. Replies Selinas giddy sidekick Holly (Juno Temple) ""Now its everyones home"" The films allusions to the Patriot Act and the decadelong incarceration of terror suspects in Guantanamo are obvious; and this time the connection of Gotham City to New York City is scarily explicit -- at least to people who live or work in Manhattan -- with scenes shot at the New York Stock Exchange and the specter of terrorism brought to the citys streets not by airplanes but by in-person anarchy. The Occupy Wall Street connection is probably pure chance since Nolan and his brother Jonathan wrote the script (from a story by the director and David S. Goyer) long before last Septembers start of demonstrations in Zuccotti Park. But the Occupy Gotham coincidence fits Nolans nearly Olympian misanthropy his disgust with the corruptibility of both class and mass and his suspicion that the only salvation is in a nearly invincible hero -- a rich man with the strength and altruism to save desperate America from itself. (Is Bruce Wayne Mitt Romney? Is Batman a Mormon?) Beneath that comic-book dream of the infallible fixer is an implicit warning that in the real America a superhero will never fly out of our dreams and into the night sky. (MORE Is Hollywood Going to Kill Batman Next Week?) Occasionally the movies pulp and fantasy origins expose themselves. The opening set piece in which Bane and his cohorts are rescued from captivity in a CIA plane by hitching a ride on a larger jet flying above it is the kind that was more suavely imagined in several James Bond films decades ago. (Bane through his apparatus often sounds like a 007 villain; you wait for him to say ""No Mr. Wayne I expect you to die."") You may also wonder why Bruce took ages to learn even from Alfred that his business empire is near depletion; why no Gothamite police or civilian thinks to shoot Bane in the leg or apply a kung fu kick to his respirator; why in a street fight between Batman and Bane none of the thousands of allies or adversaries joins in to take one or both of the men down; and why the thin frozen ice on which condemned men in wintry Gotham are meant to fall through miraculously refreezes for the next group of victims. (Theres another implausibility at the end involving a plane and a nuclear bomb that we wont parse here. Well just say if you live across the river from Gotham City move.) More often though the movies emotional gravity gives special heft to venerable Batman tropes. When after all these years the Bat-Signal illuminates the sky (Bruce has draped an unconscious villain on a searchlight to form the famous silhouette) its seriously thrilling because so much more is at stake here. Batman Begins showed Bruces hellish preparation for his defense of Gotham and The Dark Knight illuminated a skirmish with one charismatic Joker; those movies sounded the alarm for the all-out war movie that is TDKR. (MORE Emanata Batman and Robin Pour Down Like Silver) Composer Hans Zimmers percussive score underlines the dovetailed themes of battle and death. The first sounds in the film are a heartbeats thump-thump-thump that grow ever fainter; and Zimmer proceeds with sounds mimicking gunfire and ticking machinery. The movies pace both solemn and brisk is a miracle of conveying reams of narrative -- a hallmark of the old Hollywood masters whose storytelling was typically more synoptic and coherent than that of todays directors. TDKR is old-fashioned in two other ways it renounces both the 3-D standard for big action pictures (though 72 minutes of the 160-minute movies can be seen in the IMAX format) and the tendency to make every movie digitally. A proud end credit reads ""This motion picture was shot and finished on film."" This motion picture also boasts performances whose range and depth match the material. Among the series new recruits Hardy eventually reveals Bane as a creature who inflicts no more pain than he has experienced; Cotillard makes Miranda a seductive plutocrat generous enough to fund a bold new society; Gordon-Levitt is so appealing as a straight shooter a kind of junior-grade Bruce Wayne that he could spin off a superhero series of his own. Only Hathaway doesnt perform as if shes wearing weight-of-the-world epaulets; Michelle Pfeiffers frosty-furious Selina in Tim Burtons 1992 Batman Returns was closer in tone to TDKR. But Hathaway for all her ripe smiles also allows for the ambiguities that transform a poor kid into a Catwoman. And she like Bale looks great in black. (MORE Battier and Batter Review of Batman Returns) Caines Alfred frequently on the verge of tears as he talks tough Cockney love to Bruce imparts a depth of poignancy nearly shocking to viewers; they forget theyre in an action picture and recalibrate their sensibilities to accommodate Caines rich naked portrayal. Bale a boyish 30 when he first slipped into the cape and cowl back in 2004 has matured impressively in the role. For the first half of TDKR he is a gaunt haunted wraith so weary of life that he might have joined his beloved Rachel in the grave. Then he has to throw off what Miranda describes as his ""practiced apathy"" and transform Bruce through the most arduous regimen from a weak sister whom Bane can easily humiliate in a fight to the new improved Batman facing his and Gothams direst challenge. When Catwoman warns the Crusader to forget about the citys rabble because hes ""given them everything"" the whispered reply is ""Not everything. Not yet."" By the end the actor has given everything left every nuance and agony on the table for his big finish. So has his director. Nolan has said he was inspired by Charles Dickens A Tale of Two Cities; he borrowed the novels setting in a time of revolution its use of a storm motif and its proliferation of characters who are the doubles or mirror images of each other. (Bane who literally went to the same school as Bruce might be Batmans evil twin.) At the end Alfred reads the last lines from A Tale of Two Cities ""It is a far far better thing that I do than I have ever done; it is a far far better place that I go to than I have ever known."" That could be a summing up of Nolans Bruce/Batman and of The Dark Knight Rises. The movie may not top The Avengers at the worldwide box office but it is a far far better thing -- maybe the best most troubling assured and enthralling of all the superhero movies.

Pictures By Peter Travers July 16 2012 More News Sundance 2015 Stars Answer Peter Travers Burning Question 10 Best Movies of 2014 All Stories >> Audiences will be arguing forever about director Christopher Nolans capper to his Batman trilogy. Want to bitch? Start with the reactionary politics and that franchisefeeder of an ending. But the sheer scope of Nolans vision - with emotion and spectacle thundering across the screen - is staggering. The Dark Knight Rises is the King Daddy of summer movie epics. For nearly three hours Nolan juggles themes that took root in 2005s Batman Begins and reached doomsday perfection in 2008s The Dark Knight with the late Heath Ledgers masterful Oscar- winning performance as the Joker. More News Sundance 2015 Stars Answer Peter Travers Burning Question 10 Best Movies of 2014 All Stories >> The director and his coscreenwriter brother Jonathan Nolan pick up the story eight years after Batman (Christian Bale) took the rap for DA Harvey Dent. It was Dent who died going psycho as the evil Two- Face but Commissioner Gordon (the reliably superb Gary Oldman) persuaded Batman to take the blame as an impetus for severe new crime laws in Gotham. This new era of crimebusting is built on lies which is hell on Batmans alter ego playboy Bruce Wayne whos been living like a hermit in luxury - all his bat toys banished. The final chapter in the Dark Knight saga allows Bale to move deeply into Bruce/Batmans troubled soul. Bale up to every challenge in a tough role gives a hypnotic haunting performance. Grant Morrisons Guide to Batman on the Big Screen What brings Batman out of his shell and back into his bat suit? It starts with his attraction to Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) a cat burglar who teases Bruce wickedly while hiding a secret agenda. Hathaway - sexy scrappy and fast with put-downs - is dynamite as Catwoman bringing welcome humor to a movie about to be enveloped in darkness. And no one is darker than Bane (Tom Hardy) a battering ram of a villain his face covered by a grille that feeds him medicine to alleviate pain hes suffered from childhood. Hardys face is covered for 99.9 percent of the film but his physical and vocal performance is riveting. Its Bane who initiates the attack against Gotham and the stock exchange. Is Nolan equating the legit protest of Occupy Wall Street with Banes terrorism? You be the judge. Theres no denying the visual pow of the film more than half of which was shot with IMAX cameras. From the opening skyjacking to the blowing up of a football field and a nerveshattering prison break the film shakes you hard and often. Bruce/Batman finds support in butler Alfred (Michael Caine) and Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) who builds all those wonderful bat gadgets. And beautiful philanthropist Miranda Tate (the remarkable Marion Cotillard) and idealistic young cop John Blake (a sensationally good Joseph Gordon- Levitt) spring surprises no one sees coming. I cant say more without spoilers but a refresher in Batman Begins the League of Shadows and evil genius Ras al Ghul really helps. Otherwise just let The Dark Knight Rises propel you into Nolans carefully wrought maze. You may have to fight yourself out. But a movie this potent and provocative is well worth the battle.

Four years after Nolans ""Batman Begins"" sequel ""The Dark Knight"" rattled audiences with a similar audiovisual overload the new movie falls into the same rhythm and remains viscerally satisfying even when the story falters. Once again Nolans monolithic take on Batman is a jarring fractured experience fraught with tension right through its daringly open-ended conclusion. Among the recent spate of superhero blockbusters Nolans Batman movies have stood out for conveying both mature direction and fiercely intellectual screenplays but they move so quickly that its often hard to tell if they earn the pervasive reverence. At the end of the day the three movies follow the same formula blending dreary CGI spectacles with grave pontifications and brutal action. People scowl and whisper as often as things blow up which in these times is something of a Hollywood anomaly. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" comes closer to deepening the pathos of its brooding costumed lead mainly due to the climactic incidents that bring the story to a firm conclusion (even as it leaves room for fresh beginnings). With a grisly twist that puts Batman out of commission for large portions of the movie ""The Dark Knight Rises"" hardly qualifies as a superhero movie by the usual standards which may have been Nolans intention from the start. Beneath the layers of moral pontification however ""The Dark Knight Rises"" finds Batman racing against time to stop the Darth Vader-like super-terrorist Bane (Tom Hardy his face mostly obscured by a metallic vent) from detonating a nuclear bomb set to destroy Gotham City. However this is preceded by a barrage of developments that pile up so relentlessly that even Nolan -- again co-writing the screenplay with his brother Jonathan -- struggles to define whos doing what and why. Nolans storytelling is undeniably serious but never quite sober. Nevertheless ""The Dark Knight Rises"" deserves credit for having the gall to speed right out of the gate and never fully slow down. Batman (Christian Bale more bleary-eyed than in previous installments) has gone off the grid before the movie even begins. Early scenes establish that a full eight years have passed since the conclusion of ""The Dark Knight"" which found Aaron Eckharts erstwhile good-natured district attorney Harvey Dent transforming into the ghoulish Two-Face and dying in a violent confrontation. With the city assuming Batman was to blame Wayne retired his alter ego and settled into Charles Foster Kane-like seclusion in his mansion. He has lost the will to make a difference. Mirroring that downward spiral reliable Batman pal Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) has been downgraded by Gotham City fat cats to the status of a reckless warmonger in peacetime. Like Batman his influence has faded but duty inevitably calls both men back to action. That decision of course takes time but at two hours and 40 minutes ""The Dark Knight Rises"" has plenty to spare. Before even fleshing out its main villain the Nolans introduce spry diamond burglar Selena Kyle aka Catwoman although the screenplay never identifies her by that name. Played by Anne Hathaway with a series of seductive glances naughty grins and olympic combat Hathaways take on the character exists a world apart from Michelle Pfeiffers latex-covered cartoon in Tim Burtons ""Batman Returns"" a decision that results in a more believable creation but also an unmemorable one. This has been a frequent problem with Nolans gritty realist approach to the blockbuster mold which frequently trades overstatement for sleek displays with mixed results. While Hathaways character is something of a letdown Batmans new foe Bane provides a supremely menacing creation. An early scene that introduces the mythological character a former overseas prisoner raised by Batmans ex-trainer-turned-nemesis Ras al Ghul (Liam Neeson in ""Batman Begins"") outdoes everything that comes next. Tricking a group of headhunters into kidnapping him Bane takes down an entire plane and escapes with a prisoner in a deft mid-air antic that borders on the balletic. Easily outdoing the heist sequence that opened ""The Dark Knight"" it quickly establishes the extent of his demonic power. Still Banes personality leaves much to be desired mainly because hes so hard to hear beneath his silvery muzzle. Banes muffled voice embodies the movies strengths and weaknesses at once. Hes an ominous terror to be sure but also largely undefined and remote. Nolans direction seemingly takes cues from Bane ""Now is not the time for fear"" Bane tells a captive in an early bit. ""That comes later."" So we keep waiting While ""The Dark Knight Rises"" hovers in a constant state of dread it can be awfully difficult to follow each moment or care about the big picture. Is there payoff? Not so much as individually absorbing moments. Batman gets beaten to a pulpy mass in a brutally choreographed mano-a-mano with Bane in Gotham Citys sewers and the face-off puts the hero out of commission for the lengthy second act. His recuperation scenes set in a dungeon filled with worldly prisoners who become his allies goes on and on like some kind of spiritual masterclass. Unlike Nolans ""Inception"" which used its narrative momentum to dive through multiple layers of consciousness ""The Dark Knight Rises"" feels simultaneously speedy and lethargic with plenty of unremarkable cutaways and exchanges given unnecessary weight thanks to Hans Zimmers routinely invasive score (which like Banes mask often makes the dialogue inaudible). The Zimmer score is matched by IMAX-friendly images of Gothams cityscape seen from a birds eye view as its inhabitants fall prey to Banes gradual takeover. The explosive CGI has its moments with Batmans new airplane -- The Bat -- adding the latest toy to the series but Nolan relishes destruction more than the forces challenging it. Banes decimation of entire football field with the push of a button has far greater impact than any of Batmans achievements which makes you wonder where the filmmakers sympathies truly lie. When our ostensible hero does snap back into action hes less a force of vengeance than a brash machine. ""Im not afraid"" Batman growls. ""Im angry."" No matter the scale of the Batman movies their protagonist still comes across as a thin creation. And in ""The Dark Knight Rises"" hes not alone. New additions include Joseph Gordon-Leavitt as a muckraking police officer whose history with Wayne allows the younger man to convince Batman hes still worth a damn but his powers of persuasion ring hollow even when the character grows central to larger events at hand. Marion Cotillard surfaces in a few scenes as a potential Wayne love interest whose true motives arrive later on to bring the arc of the three movies full circle. But shes too underdeveloped to earn that entitlement. Only Michael Caine as trusty butler Alfred stands out with a series of desperate monologues urging Wayne to keep himself safe. Caine overpowers Batman better than Bane himself to emerge as the movies true soul. That ""The Dark Knight Rises"" manages to have any soul at all speaks to its lasting value. Unquestionably the strongest entry in the series it should go down in history not for its distracting flaws but rather the continuing defiance of big movie cliches It has few cheesy one-liners or sudden cheap jolts slo-mo shots or absurd virtual camera movement. The action props up the atmosphere rather than mowing it down. Beyond that Nolans choice for a conclusion messes with our assumptions in accordance with the same coy methodical process Nolan brought to the climaxes of ""Memento"" and ""Inception."" As original properties those movies brought fewer expectations to the table. The finale to ""The Dark Knight Rises"" will undoubtedly infuriate some viewers and perplex many more but for that same reason the movie will stick with them. Thats an appropriate takeaway Viewed as a whole Nolans trilogy is enticing and frustratingly obtuse in equal measures not unlike Batmans homegrown moral code. Criticwire grade B HOW WILL IT PLAY? Already set to break box office records ""The Dark Knight Rises"" will perform well around the country for weeks on end once it opens July 20 nationwide. The real question is whether it can maintain that moment during awards season.

People big and small are always can going to take issue with anything that is said that they dont agree with because of the platform of the internet. However whatever their issue it is only an opinion. Just like all the reviews. So technically its an opinion of an opinion. But an opinion is not based on fact but of one someones perception of a subject. There is no right or wrong nor is there any concrete evidence to suggest that their opinion is valid. Rather that its someones percieved judgement and understanding on something that theyve witnessed through their own tastes. Its abit like 2 people eating a watermelon the first person says its the tastiest melon theyre eaten; the second says its not quite like a mango. But at the end of the day its still a melon. Let others give their opinion because in the grandscheme of things its all utter bullshit. Once the dust settles the opinions will be forgotten the film will win awards and the we shall of moved onto something else.

Reply Rational May 12 2016 326 pm This is the first review I read from Eric Kohn. I read because I sa w reference to it from the comments to another review. Although I do not agree with every statement on it I found it well balanced I neithe attributes to it deep metaphysical meaning nor it dismisses its value as a reflection of current times. Some of the comments I just read here show infantile hostility to any statement expressing the limited quality of Rolans artistic vision. Reply Beth May 12 2016 326 pm How can a review of a film Im assuming none of us have seen yet make people so angry? Why dont we stop having a go at Eric Kohn and each other until Friday when we can make up our own minds? I enjoyed the first two films in the series and Im excited about seeing The Dark Knight Rises this weekend but no film is worth calling someone a fucking idiot or a fucking cunt over. If any one of us can get so angry about a movie were not living in the real world. We could put that righteous anger into changing something for the better instead of abusing other people underneath a review. Reply Roseann May 12 2016 326 pm I saw the first two ""dark nights"" I will stick to the written page. grade B? come on Eric your review is great your grade ... too generous Reply mary stuart May 12 2016 326 pm The Dark Night is a trivialization of todays society . The Joker Bane etc existed in the Batman comics way before the world terrorist become part of everyday life. To say that they represent elements of society is absurd. I agree with Theo. Dont attribute philosophical meaning to this movie. It does not deserve it. What the film gives is escapism packaged as a societal portrait. Reply raymond May 12 2016 326 pm This review like so many others by Eric Kohn is so bitter. Reply Rohan May 12 2016 326 pm Mr/Mrs.Chillax How can you state that The Dark Knight is not emblematic of the society? Im sorry but your remark does not make sense. I think you should go back and watch THE DARK KNIGHT and compare the issues in the city of Gotham with todays society. And when I say society I dont mean your county or your state. I am talking about the world in general. Isnt The Joker a terrorist? Isnt Bane a terrorist? - Most of the stuff from The Dark Knight and technology that Batman uses to find ther Joker in a way defines the Bush administration era post 9/11. Yes films are for entetainment but they are also a strong source of education. Dont watch a film because the hero can beat 10 guys and wins a girls heart. Try to understand what the films story is trying to say. Reply theo May 12 2016 326 pm everybodty in this arguments seem to forget that the film is a realization of a fucking cartoon. To elevate Nolan to a deity is an silly. Reply Mat Carson May 12 2016 326 pm Mr Rohan Seem s to believe that anybody that agrees with Kohn is in his social circle. While I have been at odds with some of his his reviews and commented so I found that this review is right on the money. Yo may disagree with him and point out why instead you chose to write an idiotic parody that does not point out why Kohn was wrong or why the movie is good. Reply Rohan May 12 2016 326 pm And Erics social circle leaves a comment to back him up. Funny Reply Dan May 12 2016 326 pm You know if anyone has been following the production of this movie and any rumors that have surfaced the way you word your review ruins a lot of plot elements. One would think you would understand this when you write the review. I dont want that stuff ruined. Sure you were ""sort of"" vague but it still probably ruined some stuff. So dont do that ok. Christ. Reply Jesse May 12 2016 326 pm Between the two of us only you have actually seen the film. Guess that means I have to wait til Friday to call you a fuckin idiot. Reply Howard May 12 2016 326 pm Way to go Eric Kohn. Finally somebody has the guts to called like it is a plot defective movie with good actors an scenery is just cheap entertainment. Nothing wrong with this. The issue arises when the groupies want to elevate it to a major artistic accomplishment by Nolan. Reply rena May 12 2016 326 pm You struck a cord with this review . I agree with your major points but disagree with your grade ( a C would have been more appropriate). Nolans films are always weak in ploy. This new iteration shows the same defect. Good Review. Reply Rohan May 12 2016 326 pm While Mr. Eric Koh does indeed give away lots of plot points in his review he also goes beyond that as he gave the film a B. Can someone please provide us a link to Mr. Kohns The Avengers review please? - ""absurd virtual camera movement?"" - Perhaps Mr. Kohn should get in touch with Warner Bros. before they go on board with the reboot in 2015 so Mr. Kohn can bring something fresh not absurd camera movements. - What a load of crap Kohn? Reply JJ May 12 2016 326 pm Oh lord...a hipsters point of view...of course he is too cool for everything. Reply EJ May 12 2016 326 pm Thank you for all the spoilers you fucking cunt. Reply Ramon May 12 2016 326 pm I thought this was the most thoughtful review I read. You may not agree with his ranking or his reasons but they are well stated and well supported. Reply Paul May 12 2016 326 pm Way too much plot given away in this review. Reply GH May 12 2016 326 pm This is not a negative review. It says that TDKR is a good movie although not a flawless masterpiece. Reply Alex May 12 2016 326 pm Well... this guy didnt like TDK or so it seems. Good. Reply Ash May 12 2016 326 pm I respect your review. I loved the 1st two Nolan Batman movies and cant wait for TDKR but not everyone is going to find it spectacular. The comments before mine would make anyone think you had given it a D grade or something. We dont all think alike. Reply I HATE YOU May 12 2016 326 pm Hate your Review. Reply rd May 12 2016 326 pm I cant trust this extremely negative review completely. Besides everyone else is praising Anne Hathaways performance as Catwoman. Reply Joseph May 12 2016 326 pm This is the most negative review of The Dark Knight Rises Ive seen so far. And the fact that the most negative review I can find gave the movie a ""B"" grade actually leaves me encouraged. Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Few blockbusters have borne so heavy a burden of audience expectation as Christopher Nolans final Batman caper and the filmmaker steps up to the occasion with a cataclysmic vision of Gotham City under siege in ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Running an exhilarating exhausting 164 minutes Nolans trilogy-capping epic sends Batman to a literal pit of despair restoring him to the core of a legend that questions and powerfully affirms the need for heroism in a fallen world. If it never quite matches the brilliance of 2008s ""The Dark Knight"" this hugely ambitious action-drama nonetheless retains the moral urgency and serious-minded pulp instincts that have made the Warners franchise a beacon of integrity in an increasingly comicbook-driven Hollywood universe. Global B.O. domination awaits. Even without the bonus of 3D a technology Nolan has resolutely avoided while continuing to shoot in 35mm and 70mm ""The Dark Knight Rises"" should continue the writer-directors commercial hot streak following ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Inception."" Pics B.O. reign will be sustained in part by repeat attendance and Imax ticket premiums; 72 minutes of the film (roughly 40%) were lensed using super-high-res Imax cameras representing the most extensive and sophisticated use of the giantscreen format in a studio picture. Once again writing with his brother Jonathan from a tale conceived with David S. Goyer Nolan has more story obligations than usual this time around. The result is a nearly three-hour yarn that draws on key plot points from ""The Dark Knight"" before bringing the trilogy full circle back to the origin story of ""Batman Begins"" even as it ushers in a motley crew of villains and allies (not always easy to tell apart) inspired by Bob Kanes original comics and pushes the citizens of Gotham into new realms of terror and mayhem. Initially at least the city is enjoying a period of relative peace eight years after the disappearance of the outlawed vigilante known as Batman presumed responsible for the death of beloved law-and-order figurehead Harvey Dent. Yet the deception continues to weigh heavily on Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) and Bruce Wayne himself (Christian Bale) now a shut-in who spends his nights slinking Hamlet-like about the parapets of Wayne Manor. While the ever-loyal Alfred (Michael Caine) supplies one of the series emotional high points with a tender expression of love and concern for the man hes known since boyhood it takes the intervention of several new characters for Wayne to return to public life. Two formidable women court his attentions first Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard) whos spearheading an important clean-energy initiative then Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) a wily cat burglar who skillfully robs the billionaire playboy and later has the nerve to upbraid him for his obscene fortune. Theres also John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) a smart young cop who clings to his belief in Batmans goodness and turns out to share some of Waynes childhood traumas. Yet the figure who decisively triggers Batmans re-emergence is Bane (Tom Hardy) a vicious mercenary introduced seizing control of an aircraft mid-flight in a bravura opening sequence (Hans Bjerno handled the stunning aerial photography). Wearing a steel-trap-like gas mask to neutralize the pain of unspeakable wounds this bald hulking brute is a former member of the League of Shadows the same ""gang of psychopaths"" that gave Wayne his own basic training. For this reason Bane is also the franchises first major villain who turns out to be a physical match for Batman something made brutally apparent in a pummeling scene of hand-to-hand mask-to-mask combat. The heavy artillery comes out just after the halfway point as Banes men take advantage of a well-attended football game to turn Gotham into a terrorist stronghold. Theres nothing particularly ingenious about their scheme (call it the Bane-ality of evil) which confronts audiences with the now-familiar spectacle of a citys apocalyptic destruction. Yet its typical of Nolans approach that his evocation of mass chaos feels so trenchantly detailed so attuned to the crisis human toll as glimpsed in the terrified faces of civilian onlookers. As d.p. Wally Pfisters camera scans the war-torn island metropolis viewers see not just buildings but social structures collapsing; anarchy ensues as prisoners are released en masse and various legal political and financial chieftains are made to answer for their alleged crimes against the underclass. All in all the picture impressively conveys a seething vision of urban anxiety that speaks to such issues as the greed and complacency of the 1% the criminal neglect of the poor and oppressed and above all the unsettling sense that no one and nothing is safe. Nolans previous Batman picture tapped into a similar vein of post-9/11 distress. Yet while ""The Dark Knight Rises"" raises the dramatic stakes considerably at least in terms of its potential body count it doesnt have its predecessors breathless sense of menace or its demonic showmanship and with the exception of one audacious sleight-of-hand twist the story can at times seem more complicated than intricate especially in its reliance on portentous exposition and geographically far-flung flashbacks. Perhaps inevitably one also feels the absence of a villain as indelible as Heath Ledgers Joker although Hardy does make Bane a creature of distinct malevolence with his baroque speech patterns and rumbling bass tones provoking a sort of lower-register duet when pitted against Batmans own voice-distorted growl (the sound mix rendered their dialogue mostly if not entirely intelligible at the screening attended). In a more gratifying development the film reasserts the primacy of its title character and the general excellence of Bales performance forcing Wayne to reckon once and for all with the alter ego hes fashioned for himself and Gotham in the name of justice. If the point is that only a state of total desperation can push a person to greatness Nolan movingly acknowledges the limits of lone-ranger justice as Selina Miranda Gordon Blake and Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) Waynes old friend and gadgets expert come to play crucial and sometimes unexpected roles in the twisty drama. Hardy Gordon-Levitt and Cotillard recruited for duty after their stints in ""Inception"" are all on their game here blending easily in a supporting cast anchored by old pros Caine Oldman and Freeman. Perhaps the riskiest casting choice was that of Hathaway in the potentially problematic role of Selina/Catwoman but although her kitty outfit reps a slightly more cartoonish touch than Nolans neo-noir aesthetic typically allows (if nowhere near as campy as those worn by Halle Berry and Michelle Pfeiffer) the versatile actress nails the sardonic hard-edged tone necessary to make this morally ambiguous vixen a dynamic foil for the Caped Crusader. Production designers Nathan Crowley and Kevin Kavanaugh opt for a grittier more working-class Gotham this time around a fully inhabited city of rundown street corners public-works offices bombed-out bridges and fetid sewers. While Chicago served as a recognizable template in the earlier two pictures the exterior city shots here were achieved in New York Pittsburgh and especially Los Angeles whose downtown serves as the backdrop for a thrilling Michael Mann-style street chase marked by the appearance of Waynes latest vessel a jet-helicopter hybrid known simply as the Bat. Lee Smiths editing maintains tautness and energy over the estimable running time and Hans Zimmer adds a few ivory-tickling grace notes to his magnificently brooding score still one of the most striking and definitive elements of this altogether exemplary studio franchise.

Pictures A truly grand finale raises Christopher Nolans Batman trilogy to the peak of big-screen comic book adaptations. TWITTER Christopher Nolans Batman finale stars Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne and features performances from series newcomers Anne Hathaway Tom Hardy Marion Cotillard and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. The real world threats of terrorism political anarchy and economic instability make deep incursions into the cinematic comic book domain in The Dark Knight Rises. Big-time Hollywood filmmaking at its most massively accomplished this last installment of Christopher Nolans Batman trilogy makes everything in the rival Marvel universe look thoroughly silly and childish. Entirely enveloping and at times unnerving in a relevant way one would never have imagined as a cohesive whole this ranks as the best of Nolans trio even if it lacks -- how could it not? -- an element as unique as Heath Ledgers immortal turn in The Dark Knight. Its a blockbuster by any standard. PHOTOS Batman Through The Years Christian Bale George Clooney and Others Whove Played the Dark Knight The director daringly pushes the credibility of a Gotham City besieged by nuclear-armed revolutionaries to such an extent that it momentarily seems absurd that a guy in a costume who refuses to kill people could conceivably show up to save the day. This is especially true since Nolan probably more than any other filmmaker whos ever gotten seriously involved with a superhero character has gone so far to unmask and debilitate such a figure. But he gets away with it and unlike some interludes in the previous films everything here is lucid to the point and on the mark richly filling out (especially when seen in the Imax format) every moment of the 164-minute running time. In a curtain raiser James Bond would kill for a CIA aircraft transporting terrorists is sensationally hijacked in midair by Bane (Tom Hardy) an intimidating hulk whose nose and mouth are encumbered by a tubular grill-like metal mask which gives his voice an artificial quality not unlike that of Darth Vader. What Bane is up to is not entirely clear but it cant be good. Batmans Onscreen Villains 10 Greats From The Joker to Bane Although its only been four years since the last Batman film eight years of dramatic time have elapsed since the climactic events depicted in The Dark Knight. Batman and Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) have been in suspiciously simultaneous total seclusion much to the consternation of loyal valet Alfred (Michael Caine) who upbraiding his boss for inaction accuses him of ""just waiting for things to get bad again."" They do in a hurry. But in the interim Gotham has scarcely missed him as hes publicly blamed for the death of D.A. Harvey Dent and hasnt needed him anyway since organized crime has virtually disappeared. Bruce begins being dragged back into the limelight by slinky Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) a spirited cat burglar who lifts his fingerprints and a necklace from his safe while pulling a job at his mansion. It was always a question how this ambiguous feline character (never called Catwoman herein) would be worked into the fabric of this Batman series but co-screenwriters Jonathan and Christopher Nolan working from a story by the director and David S. Goyer have cannily threaded her through the tale as an alluring gadfly and tease who engages in an ongoing game of one-upmanship with Batman and whose selfishness prevents her from making anything beyond opportunistic alliances. STORY Man of Steel Footage So Good It Makes Fans Cry Commandeering the citys sewers with his fellow mercenaries Bane begins his onslaught first with an attempted kidnapping of Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) then with a brazen attack on the Stock Exchange which at the films 45-minute mark has the double effect of luring Batman out of hiding and bankrupting Bruce Wayne. The latter catastrophe forces the fallen tycoon to ask wealthy amorously inclined board member Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard) to assume control of his company to squeeze out Daggett (Ben Mendelsohn) whos in cahoots with Bane. Nolan has thus boldly rooted his film in what are arguably the two big worries of the age terrorism and economic collapse the result of which can only be chaos. So when virtually the entire Gotham police force is lured underground to try to flush out Bane the latter has the lawmen just where he wants them trapped like animals in a pen waiting for slaughter. And the fact that Gotham City has for the first time realistically used New York City for most of its urban locations merely adds to the topical resonance of Banes brilliantly engineered plot in which he eventually takes the entire population of Manhattan hostage. Nolan has always been a very serious even remorseless filmmaker and never more so than he is here. PHOTOS Dark Knight Returns Images From the Animated Film Inducing Selina to take him to Bane Batman gets more than he bargained for; physically hes no match for the mountainously muscled warrior who sends the legendary crime fighter off to a literal hellhole of a prison with the parting promise of reducing Gotham to ashes. Seemingly located in the Middle East the dungeon resembles a huge well and has been escaped from only once by none other than Bane who is said to have been born there and got out as a child. Here as elsewhere there are complex ties leading back to the comic books that link characters and motivations together; with Bruce and Bane it is with the League of Shadows which occasions the brief return of Liam Neesons Ras Al Ghul last seen in Batman Begins (in 2005). A solid new character Joseph Gordon-Levitts resourceful street cop John Blake is a grateful product of one of the Wayne Foundations orphanages. Many of the characters wear masks either literal or figurative; provocatively Batmans mask hides his entire face except for his mouth the very part of Bane which is covered. This is just one of the motifs the Nolans have used to ingeniously plot out the resolution to their three-part saga which involves at least one major superbly hidden surprise. PHOTOS 10 Top Summer Superheroes Movies Of All Time Battle of Box Office Brawn While Bruce Wayne languishes in the pit rebuilding his strength for an escape attempt Bane spectacularly and mercilessly reverses the entire social order of Gotham City 1000 dangerous criminals are released from prison the rich are tossed out of their uptown homes the remaining police hide out like rats underground and a ""peoples court"" (presided over by Cillian Murphys Scarecrow) dispenses death sentences willy-nilly. With virtually all bridges and tunnels destroyed no one can leave the island which is threatened by a fusion device initially developed by Bruce and his longtime tech genius Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) as a clean energy source but now transformed at Banes behest into a nuke which he promises to use. Some of the action scenes such as multiple chases involving the armed motorcycle Bat-Pod (mostly ridden by Selina) and the cool new one-man jet chopper-like aircraft called The Bat that zooms through the citys caverns like something out of the early Star Wars have something of a familiar feel. But the opening skyjacking the Stock Exchange melee and especially the multiple explosions that bring the city to its knees -- underground on bridges and most strikingly in a football stadium -- are fresh and brilliantly rendered as are all the other effects. The film reportedly cost 250 million but it would be easy to believe that the figure was quite a bit more so elaborate is everything about the production. PHOTOS Top 15 Grossing Threequels of All Time But the fact that all the money has been put to the use of making the severe dramatic events feel so realistic -- theres not a hint of cheesiness or the cartoonlike -- ratchets up the suspense and pervasive feeling of unease. One knows going in that this film will mark the end of Batman at least for now and as rendered by Bale and Nolan but for the first time there is the sense that it could also really be the end for Batman that he might be sacrificed or sacrifice himself for the greater good. Needing to portray both his characters as vulnerable even perishable Bale is at his series best in this film. At times in the past his voice seemed too artificially deepened and transformed; theres a bit of that here but far less and as Bruce becomes impoverished and Batman incapacitated the actors nuances increase. Caine has a couple of surprisingly emotional scenes to play and handles them with lovely restraint while other returnees Oldman and Freeman deliver as expected. PHOTOS 28 of Summers Most Anticipated Movies Avengers Dark Knight Prometheus Bane is a fearsome figure fascinating in his physicality and blithely confident approach to amoral anarchy. With the mask strapped to his head at all times and his voice altered Hardy is obliged to express himself mostly through body language which he does powerfully and at a couple of key moments his eyes speak volumes. All the same the facial and verbal restrictions provide emotive limitations and his final moments onscreen feel almost thrown away; one feels a bit cheated of a proper sendoff. Hathaway invests her catlike woman with verve and impudence while Cotillard is a warm and welcome addition to this often forbidding world. Even though Nolan and Bale have made it clear that The Dark Knight Rises marks their farewell to Bruce Wayne and Batman the final shot clearly indicates the direction a follow-up offshoot series by Warner Bros. likely will take. PHOTOS The Christian Bale Directors Posse 6 Auteurs Won Over By the Actor As before the production values are opulent and sensational; nothing short of the highest praise can be lavished on the work of production designers Nathan Crowley and Kevin Kavanaugh cinematogtapher Wally Pfister costume designer Lindy Hemming visual effects supervisor Paul Franklin special effects supervisor Chris Corbould editor Lee Smith composer Hans Zimmer and sound designer Richard King just for starters. The only conspicuous faux pas is a big continuity gaffe that has the raid on the Stock Exchange take place during the day but the subsequent getaway chase unfold at night. Nearly half the film including all the big action scenes was shot with large-format Imax cameras and with both versions having been previewed the 70mm Imax presentation that will be shown in 102 locations worldwide is markedly more vivid visually and powerful as a dramatic experience; the normal 35mm prints while beautiful are somewhat less sharp. PHOTOS Brief History of Catwoman Despite all the advanced technology deployed to make The Dark Knight Rises everything it is Nolan remains proudly and defiantly old school (as only the most successful directors can get away with being these days) when it comes to his filmmaking aesthetic an approach indicated in a note at the end of the long final credits ""This motion picture was shot and finished on film.""

First there was The Avengers which ticked all the right geeky boxes and made a truckload of dosh. Then Prometheus which disappointed most but still managed to ring a few tills. Now here comes the biggie. Can Christopher Nolan see out his Bat trilogy in style? Can he make that so-far-elusive five-star superhero movie the one which gets the blend between action emotion plot and character just right? Can he at least live up to the eyepopping standard he set with 2008s The Dark Knight? The answers are yes no and mostly. As its running time suggests The Dark Knight Rises is a sprawling epic feast of a movie stuffed to the gills with side characters subplots and diversions. So if the balance skews in favour of grandstanding action rather than emotional resonance of statuesque icons rather than real people we can let it slide. Theres nothing here to match the intensity of Heath Ledgers Joker and the movie feels weaker for it. But that was a one-off and the show must go on. Were reintroduced to Bruce Wayne aka Batman (Christian Bale) living as a recluse holed up in the east wing of Wayne Manor while Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) presides over a relatively crime-free Gotham City. But when marauding mask-wearing psycho Bane (Tom Hardy) muscles in with the intention of kickstarting a popular revolution Bruce must don the cape and cowl once again. This is just the central thread in an increasingly tangled story theres also Anne Hathaway as a slinky burgling Catwoman Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a square-jawed beat cop and lots of confusing financial shenanigans with the shareholders of Wayne Enterprises. As in the previous films Nolan and his co-writer his brother Jonathan draw on real-world issues to spice up the fantasy and with dubious results with its rampaging Occupy Gotham anarchists philanthropic billionaires and decent cops who ignore due process this is so staunchly right-wing itll thrill all those Fox News anchors outraged by The Muppets. But when the Bat flies such considerations go out the window. Sublimating CGI in favour of real crowd scenes and massive cityscapes Nolan creates a grand dirty engrossing world and his action sequences just hum. The way the various strands tie up is a mite predictable but its satisfying nonetheless. And as our heroes swoop off into the sunset we realise weve been witness to something truly impressive a seven-year cinematic adventure which combined the epic and the personal in dizzying inventive sometimes perplexing often enthralling always imaginative ways.

The film is essentially a comic book story but the director tries to insert some sort of analysis and ethical commentary on wealth and corporations. This fails cause the protagonist is mega-wealthy and uses the stock market so how can there simultaneously be criticism of the global financial market? The message seems to be that it depends how the market is used blah blah there is not sufficient skill to delivery this message. 2. The best character actor and part of the story is Bane. And again more moral ambiguity. Bane also seems like the most sympathetic character he was in a hell hole and saved a child. He is a hero we are sick and tired of Batman and you sort of would like Bane to finish the guy. Point here is make a movie about Bane. 3. By the third hour I am almost asleep but then there is the moral conundrum that Gotham is thrown into as citizens are supposed to turn on each other- a repeat but longer of the same idea in the last Batman. . where also the best character actor etc was the antagonist. However the idea is not fully played out why do they turn on each other how? Borrowing thinly from the Jacobins and Robespierre is not well done. 4. Why do Batman and Catwoman have no chemistry?

Long depressing scenes filmed underground; people stuck in cavernous pits generally doing sod all Interspersed with occasional fantastic hi-tec FX. The 1st like the 3rd lacked punch and a sense of direction. In both Batman was lame and the whole thing felt like a one man led show that man being C Nolan. Part 2 The Dark Knight worked because of a great Oscar winning performance that brought life danger and fun into the film; or to put it another way it was a good film cos C Nolan got lucky Isnt he in danger of joining a whole group of American directors whose films rely entirely on visual tricks - with the aid of lorry loads of money - due to a lack of genuine film-making vision and creative talent? Look at Inception; jaw dropping FX yes but the film wasnt really about anything It was so bland and repetitive... Batman the Gothic superhero action/adventure needs to be revived once more...

They have succeeded the city is as vibrant as ever and this film shows paradoxically its endurance with other attacks that do not destroy Gotham thanks to Batman of course The aerial vehicle of Batman seems an ufo over the city. The camera movements makes it to simulate a bat. Excellent. The sound track too. Although Bane (Tom Hardy) announced at the beginning that what matters is his plan it is unclear what the aEUR~revolutionaryaEUR(tm) plan is. Much less is understood that he is a necessary evil. How would a revolution take place when no one knows where is heading? A revolution requires strategist planning clear strategies defined purposes. Similarly many protests end up as parades because at the end of the day nobody knows what the next step is. Meanwhile people get tired in the process. A pleasure to enjoy such strong chemistry between Bruce (Christian Bale) and Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway). They have to really attract each other Selinas naked neck is spectacular as shown by BruceaEUR(tm)s mother stolen pearls on her neck. Also in one scene Bruce turns his back to Selina showing his trust which she honors by not attacking him from behind but disappearing instead. The film works with the fragility of good over evil in both Bruce WayneaEUR(tm)s as well as police commissioner GordonaEUR(tm)s physical fragilities. The street battles are improbable for our Batman. This theme is dealt brilliantly by HitchcockaEUR(tm)s villains. Seeing the movie gave me the impression that the author of the massacre in Colorado had seen it earlier because of the strong similitude with the scenes of violence Bane performed on Wall Street and in the crowded stadium. It is noticed that Bane is not at the level of evil misuse of intelligence that the Joker reached in the second part of the trilogy. I think because evil is divided into two characters Bane and Miranda for the alleged advantage of adding the element of surprise when we learned at the end that she aEUR"" a woman - was the real villain. The effect is not good because her acting is loose. She had the challenge of playing the role of an ordinary looking woman hiding her extraordinariness. But she played the role ordinarily. Another issue the importance of a good teacher and her noble teachings the movie reminds me of the acclaimed film ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"". It is not knowledge the technology alone but the use we make of them what puts ethics over science and tech. Some critics complain of the film lack of coherence its confusing narrative. Even if this were true I do not consider it a problem (apart from the prejudice of considering coherence as always a benefit). Usually artists and thinkers wait some time for a critical appraisal of the past. The movie talks about the present and shares the same confusion of the moment. It has the freshness and vitality of being current. IaEUR(tm)ll paraphrase lines of the libretto - by Christopher and Jonathan Nolan - that I find memorable Bain No one was interested in who I was until I got the mask. No true despair without hope. I am not afraid I am angry. Bain to Batman You think the darkness is your ally? I was born in the shadows you adopted it.  No need for heroes in peace time. Selina When you do what you gotta do then nobody letaEUR(tm)s you do what you want to do. Precisely the problem of Carlito (Al Pacino) in Carlitos Way. The older man to Bruce Your problem is that you lost your fear of death believing it is better. Come up without the rope as did the child so will return the fear of death that will make you brave.aEUR(tm) (Note the importance of the collective and individual mantra while trying to escape from the cave.) Robin ""Sometimes structures become barriers.aEUR(tm) (So you have to leave them) Bruce There is nothing out there for me. Batman to Robin ""If you work alone use a mask.  Bruce to Selina There is more in you than that. In the end going out to sea we recognize the infamous image of a mushroom as a direct quote of the atomic bomb explosion on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Can one man really save Gotham city? Bruce insists that he is an ordinary man and that anyone with good deeds can be a hero. Underneath his mask Batmans green eyes symbolize hope. Do you believe him?

Even though the film was 3 hours it want quickly as the film was well edited. The actions sequences were excellent esp the beginning with the plane hijack and the storming of the stock exchange was quite funny. bane was the frightening psychopath character that i was expecting even more so then the joker played by Heath Ledger. The Hans Zimmer musical score was thumping and very loud especially in imax theatres.. i thought a bit too loud anyway. There were enough plots and sublots within a decent enough script. The ending though was a bit predictable and the way the military was kept out once banes revolution started was a bit ridiculous and too convenient when you had a nutter with a nuclear bomb which was going to blow up the enire city believe you me the military would have intervened regardless of any threats. And one scene was a bit ridculous ( sorry spoilers) but where the bomb has only 1 1/2 minutes left the pace of the film slows down for an emotional farewell speech from batman and the commssioner.and a last kiss from Catwoman.not goo Nolan. And sorry but if a nuclear bomb goes off over water it WILL create a tsunami from the massive shockwave. Everything leading up to the end of the film was quite excellent with amazing moments of thumping action.... i know its a 12 A but you needto show more blood and guts when people are getting blown to pieces with machine guns no blood not realistic and emotional scenes especially with Micheal Cane..  but the ending was corny i dont know maybe to satisfy the teen kids which was a pity it could have been better my opinion. Anyway i give this film 4 stars because there was enough thumping action indispersed with some decent actingFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 6 2012DanielFeaturedLoved it far exceeded my high expectations.

I must admit that the special effects and CGI are excellent as are some of the costumes. But this does not make a film when its tension only arises because you are brutally attacked by overbearing (and badly balanced) sounds and excessive visual stimulation rather than a clever scenario or slow-building climax.

Perhaps he was tired having already come up with 2 great movies and got stumped trying to come up with fresh ideas for this one. Perhaps he was busy working on something else that commanded his attention (superman 2013 lol) Its not so much that I expected it to be as good as the other two. Its a sequel to a sequel. The problem is that even standing on its own it just wasnt a good movie. There was parts of it that made me wonder if I was actually watching a Nolan inspired Batman film at all and not some tv show. If you are going to make a movie that is almost 3 hours long it has to all flow together and be coherent throughout the entire movie. Speaking of which for me the movie doesnt actually start until almost an hour in. Bad editing period and this is not the first time Nolan has been guilty of it. I thought Dark Knight was entirely too long as well. But overall it was a solid coherent enjoyable movie all around so I could overlook that. Another thing is I didnt like the character development for the Villians in this movie at all. It was very sloppy. Bane for one came off as being too one dimensional. There was nothing subtle about him and for me nothing likable. Bad guy wants to take over the world. Good guy fights bad guy. It has been done before but much better. Yeah I get that he wanted to have the whole twist at the end and the happy ending but in focusing on that as the big bang moment instead of tying up lose ends in the storyline editing and character development. He took away from what could have been a much more solid and great movie. That being said it was an ok movie not horrible but just safe.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 24 2012ElectroheadFeaturedDisappointing. As another person already said Christian Bale looks bored and tired. There is little enthusiasm from Batman and it does not come across as calm and cool or whatever they were trying to achieve. Infact he was actually irritating to watch. Tom Hardy as Bane totally makes this movie. Without him this wouldve been a total fail in my opinion.

Not the worst film ever made but deft innately worst than inception batman begins dark knight and momento and on par with insomnia. Sorry Nolan and batman fans but I am being honest here.

Music and sound effects was brill. The first fight seem as edgy and very exciting but where was the calm batman intelligence?. the bat plane did look at time very wobbly.

Yes it wasnt flawless but by no means deserving of the 1/5 or 2/5 viewers have given it The fight scenes were very good - Batman has not been physically beaten in the other 2 films as he was in this one because Bane is a different type of criminal; he tested the Batman physically whereas the Joker tested him more mentally. Yes Heath Ledgers Joker was amazing and Bane wasnt quite as good but I couldnt think of another superhero film that has a villain nearly as good as Bane or The Joker It was well written the special effects were awesome it was on a much more epic scale than ever before the acting was very good and Zimmer did a great job on the score. While I too did find Bane a little hard to understand at times there were no lines that were completely incomprehensible from him - I found that every one of Banes lines was really cool or meaningful in some way. It was long yes but I didnt really notice the time going by There are a few things that stop it getting 5 stars from me but these were minor flaws in the grand scheme of things.

Where the subtleties that Nolan can normally draw from high-concept entertainment (Inception)? Where was the humanity (Memento)? Where was the partnership of the real and the artifice (Inception again)? This was loud vacuous repetitive at times criminally mundane. The acting was fine (Joseph and Anne particularly) and Michael Caine was impressively moving for someone who has never been truly an actor (he is a deliverer). But Christian fails on all levels (the Batman growl is truly absurd). Technically the film (aside from the impressive opening in-flight salvo) was average at best. The sound was absurd Zimmers (me do big score) soundtrack lacked any real drama or subtlety. An overlong average end to a trilogy that has never quite escaped its shackles. I still wait for a truly great Batman film. Maybe James Cameron can persuade Clint Eastwood to don the cape and cowl for a proper version of Millers Dark Knight Returns?
