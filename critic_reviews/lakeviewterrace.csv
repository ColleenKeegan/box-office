"Unhinged and living next door - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEW Unhinged and living next doorSamuel L. Jacksons tightly wrapped cop turns up the heat on an interracial couple in Lakeview Terrace.September 19 2008|Robert Abele | Special to The Times Novel in concept and not without exploitative juice ""Lakeview Terrace"" updates the bad-cop-neighbor premise of the early-90s potboiler ""Unlawful Entry"" by adding a twist of color. Hey there attractive young interracial couple moving into that lovely new upscale suburban home meet your worst next-door nightmare a bigoted African American copAnd yet this new film from human-relations bad boy Neil LaBute (""In the Company of Men"" ""The Shape of Things"") is hardly slap-and-prod issue moviemaking -- considering its title refers to the San Fernando Valley area where Rodney King was beaten -- or even a provocateurs pulpish slumming. Working from a script by David Loughery and Howard Korder LaBute offers up a casually sinister character-oriented corrective to his laughable remake of ""The Wicker Man.""It stars Samuel L. Jackson as a widowed middle-age L.A. policeman named Abel Turner whose tightly wound attitudes about security and racial progress -- patrolling the neighborhood at night correcting his kids grammar demeaning their cultural tastes -- bubble into something openly hostile when he discovers his new neighbors the Mattsons are a white man (Patrick Wilson) and an African American woman (Kerry Washington).The progressively minded Chris and Lisa Mattson love each other but theyre hardly a perfect union and Wilson and Washington handle this tension nicely. Her conservative father (Ron Glass) ignores hubby while Chris isnt as sure as Lisa is about starting a family right away. But its nothing compared with the harassing vibe from one house over blinding security lights at night Abels taunting of their guests at a housewarming party and his flare-ups over perceived influences on his teenage daughter. Unfortunately for Lisa and Chris Abels badge means their options for fighting back are few and their attempts at detente seem only to escalate his campaign to make them leave.Ironically audiences may view the star of ""Lakeview Terrace"" with wariness before the Mattsons have cause to. Will this be the flinty dangerous screen-commanding version of Jackson or the autopilot bad-ass of countless insipid action flicks? Thankfully its the former. Jackson modulates Abels internal turmoil and heated exchanges with enough shades of loneliness steely generosity and wicked playfulness to give the actor firm control of our fascination and growing unease.In classic B-movie villain fashion he simply commits to shifting the molecules in the air whenever he can and in ways more unnerving -- the probing question that acts like a veiled threat for example -- than the physical altercations or those thematically obvious panoramic shots of distant fires creeping toward the characters hillside sanctuaries. The upshot is that Jackson is in sync with the filmmakers less inflammatory mission working you up over an unhinged dude in a blue uniform rather than an angry guy with black skin.That said when the movie eventually explains Abel for us before asserting its good-versus-evil priorities in the final act facile psychologizing and guns take over and Jackson becomes effectively genre-trapped. But until then ""Lakeview Terrace"" is a serviceable enough popcorn exercise in a few floundering Angelenos who cant just get along.--""Lakeview Terrace.""

So yes this smallish fantasy is a comic riff on ""The Sixth Sense"" which has gone from thriller to cliche in nine years. And yes the new film which David Koepp directed from a script he wrote with John Kamps is inevitably deadened by contrivance. But its enlivened by the performance of Ricky Gervais as Bertram Pincus a latter-day Scrooge for whom the living are no less annoying than the dead. ENLARGE From left Ricky Gervais Tea Leoni and Greg Kinnear in ""Ghost Town"" Everett Collection Mr. Gervais is the British comedian who played the smug office manager in the original BBC version of ""The Office."" At first his performance here is a model of unyielding almost plaintive misanthropy in the face of Mr. Koepps otherwise broad comic style. A Manhattan dentist who uses the appliances of his trade to silence garrulous patients Pincus genuinely dislikes people and Mr. Gervais only intensifies his characters acidity when the dentist finds himself bedeviled by a group of needy nudgy ghosts. (Since the trailer will tell you exactly how and why this happens I wont.) Chief among the spectral nuisances is Greg Kinnears Frank Herlihy a dead man walking the sidewalks of New York in the dinner jacket he was wearing when he died. He wants Pincus to break up the impending re-marriage of his widow Gwen an archaeologist played by Tea Leoni. As the fable wears on Franks beseechments get to be repetitive and Pincuss flintiness runs low on verve. For all the brilliance of his success in TV Mr. Gervais doesnt have extensive experience as an actor in feature films and Mr. Koepp isnt the director to help him. Courtesy of Paramount Pictures. His performance grows more appealing -- the genuine animus gives way to some sweetness -- once the relationship between Pincus and Gwen moves beyond some elaborately unfunny antics involving a mummy and the script starts to give its Scrooge a new appreciation of life. (Id almost forgotten what a fine comedienne Ms. Leoni can be until a scene with her entering an elevator.) Eventually though ""Ghost Town"" buckles beneath the weight of contrivance -- so many ghosts to dispel so many lessons to learn. And the films physical aspects raise questions about population density. For a while we seem to be watching a for-ghosts-only version of Manhattan where the sidewalks are uncrowded and traffic moves freely in the streets. But no this is not the case. The living live there too though in such small numbers as to enjoy plenty of lebensraum. Thats the ultimate fantasy. The Duchess During one moment of excitement in ""The Duchess"" an 18th-century costume drama starring Keira Knightley as the Duchess of Devonshire Georgiana Spencer the unhappy heroine gets tipsy at a big party and has a frightening encounter with a candelabras flames. ""Please put out her graces hair"" her dour husband commands and the deed is done in the nick of time. The production is lavish the star is lovely and her character occupies a special place in English history as a great beauty a great wit a great model of proto-feminism and the great-great-great-great-aunt of Princess Diana. Whats missing is dramatic fire. Also in Weekend JournalActress Keira Knightley on big wigs the Di debate and the new movie The Duchess. Adviser Knightleys Noble Again You might not know that if you watched with the sound turned off. All the pieces of a powerful drama look to be in place -- a passionate young woman who for all her celebrity and star power might just as well be the late princess; Georgianas implacably dispassionate husband William the 5th Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes); Georgianas best friend Bess (Hayley Atwell) who turns their marriage into a menage a trois; and a backdrop of reform politics in a time of tumultuous change. With the sound turned on the campaign oratory could pass for proto-McCain/Obama but thats a minor distraction or amusement. The major deficits lie in the script which was adapted from the scintillating biography by Amanda Foreman and in what the director Saul Dibb has made of it. Instead of scintillation the movie gives us a succession of discrete set pieces as if the action takes place in rooms but not in the halls connecting them; dialogue that plays on the surface of Georgianas brilliance without getting under her skin let alone into her soul and a resolutely glum portrayal by Mr. Fiennes that may be true to Williams character but leaves us yearning for less. Princess Di deserves livelier revisionism. Appaloosa As for the woman in ""Appaloosa"" a Western directed and co-written by Ed Harris no one can accuse her of being a proto-feminist. Allison French a young widow played by Renee Zellweger wants nothing more or less than to get her hooks into the top hand in town whoever he may be. (Were also told that shes attracted to the boss stallion but he is not by way of keeping things clear a horse.) Mr. Harris plays Appaloosas city marshal Virgil Cole a rigid moralist who falls for Allie as he has never fallen before. Viggo Mortensen -- the two men appeared together in ""A History of Violence"" -- is Virgils deputy and steadfast friend Everett Hitch and Jeremy Irons is the bad-guy rancher Randall Bragg who runs the town until the two lawmen challenge his ruthless reign. Given Allies obviously unpleasant proclivities its hard to understand why Virgil loves her so ardently. But its equally hard to understand why Allie doesnt see that Virgils moral code masks a violent psychopathic streak or why that streak comes and goes without anyone ever discussing it. Or why for that matter ""Appaloosa"" is so mannered episodic and slow though it can be a danger sign when a movie is directed by one of its stars and carries credits for eight producers. Lakeview Terrace ""Lakeview Terrace"" occupies the bottom of the weeks barrel. This joyless and airless suspense thriller stars Samuel L. Jackson as Abel Turner a veteran LAPD cop whose smoldering racism explodes into assaultive fascism when a young interracial couple moves into the house next door. (Theyre played by Patrick Wilson and Kerry Washington.) The model for this genre is Sam Peckinpahs surpassingly bleak and superviolent ""Straw Dogs"" but Abel has been written as a straw man and Mr. Jackson an actor of formidable gifts plays him with the subtlety of a robot stuck in destruct mode. The question posed by the vulgar script is whether the earnestly liberal couple -- he drives a Prius -- will withstand the tensions that Abels bigotry foments and stand up to their neighbors tyranny. The answer is yes on both counts and they cope with raging brushfires in the bargain. The movies only mark of restraint is the absence of an earthquake. DVD TIP Ive recommended ""Truly Madly Deeply"" before. Nows a perfect time to recommend it again. The late Anthony Minghellas first feature made in 1991 is a witty gorgeously lyrical and infinitely superior alternative to ""Ghost"" which came out the previous year. Juliet Stevenson is Nina drowning in grief since the death of her musician lover. Alan Rickman is the musician Jamie who unfazed by his death hangs out at Ninas house and invites dead friends to keep him company.

"Lakeview Terrace A conflagration of social comment | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsLakeview Terrace A conflagration of social commentWe know early on in Neil LaButes Lakeview Terrace that it isnt going to be your average Samuel L. Jackson movie even if his rage suggests otherwise.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Sept. 19 2008 Lakeview Terrace (out of 4)Starring Samuel L. Jackson Patrick Wilson and Kerry Washington. Directed by Neil LaBute. 110 minutes. At major theatres. 14A We know early on in Neil LaButes Lakeview Terrace that it isnt going to be your average Samuel L. Jackson movie even if his rage suggests otherwise.As Abel Turner a widowed LAPD cop raising two kids on his own Jackson is seen silently folding laundry like the good dad he is. Other signs of parental love - packed lunches scolds over schoolwork - put Jackson in a domestic light rarely seen in his movies.It also elevates the intrigue of a movie that could easily have tipped into formula the ""neighbour from hell"" trope commonly seen in comedies. Turner is a bully but hes also more than that. Hes motivated by simmering issues that LaBute and screenwriters David Loughery and Howard Korder fan into a roaring conflagration of social comment. Burning brushfires over the L.A. skyline which seem to be approaching Turners abode add metaphorical and physical realism.Turner doesnt immediately fly off the handle when new neighbours Chris (Patrick Wilson) and Lisa (Kerry Washington) move into his manicured cul-de-sac. But he soon reacts when he and his two kids (Regine Nehy and Jaishon Fisher) spot the couple enjoying midnight sex in their well-lit pool. But does the intimacy really irk Turner? Hes not above hosting a raunchy party with strippers at his home for his LAPD fellows. Might he really be objecting to the fact that Chris is white and Lisa is black? Why would this bother him? He begins to challenge Chris punctuating vague threats with a lethal smile.As the alpha male on his side of the fence Chris quickly picks up on Turners antipathy and vows not to tolerate it. Lisas father Harold (Ron Glass) warns Chris that there are more hues at play than black and white ""He has the colour issue on his side. And that colour happens to be blue."" Lakeview Terrace is fiction but it registers with the reality of modern urban life the same way Crash did in 2004. Its one thing to pay lip service to racial equality and tolerance; its quite another to put those virtues into practise when your tiny kingdom appears threatened by change.Its a major rebound for LaBute after the embarrassment of his remake of The Wicker Man two years ago. Jackson hasnt had a role this good or this complex in many a moon even if the rote ending betrays the complexity of the set-up. He spars well with Wilson (Little Children) and Washington (The Last King of Scotland) neither of whom are shrinking violets. They have issues and desires too and theyre not afraid of a fight.As the flames of those bushfires move ever closer to the neighbourhood it feels like all of L.A. - and maybe the entire world - is ablaze.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Jackson in ""Lakeview Terrace."" Samuel L. Jackson in ""Lakeview Terrace."" Photo Chuck Zlotnick Sony Movie review Lakeview Terrace 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Lakeview Terrace Suspense thriller. Starring Samuel L. Jackson and Patrick Wilson. Directed by Neil LaBute. (PG-13. 106 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In its overall shape and message ""Lakeview Terrace"" is a conventional suspense thriller but the details kick it up a notch. Theres a racial element thats unexpected. Theres a narrative strategy thats slightly innovative. And then theres Samuel L. Jacksons face and everything he can do with it the impassive look. The burning-holes-through-concrete stare. The smile thats the opposite of reassuring. And the laugh that says ""Youre so dead."" There may be no actor working today with a better sense of how to use his face and what each expression communicates to an audience. Directed but not scripted by Neil LaBute the film continues LaButes ongoing investigation into the sheer hell that is other people. We first meet Abel (Jackson) as hes waking up on a typical weekday. He says his prayers gets the kids up and serves them breakfast. He endures wise remarks from his teenage daughter then spends some time folding the kids laundry. Hes a widowed dad and seems like a nice enough guy. And then the new neighbors move in. Its a nice touch LaBute shows us the new neighbors van pull up in one unbroken shot from Abels perspective. The neighbors are a source of mystery and of mild consternation to him - and thus to us as well. And then somehow seamlessly and very early into the story LaBute and screenwriters David Loughery and Howard Korder make the switch Theres absolutely nothing wrong with the neighbors. Its Abel whos a bit strange. He might even be a little crazy. You know with suppressed rage. So right off the top the entertainment value is guaranteed. We have a movie that explores what it would be like to move into a nice neighborhood and find that your next-door neighbor is Jackson in his angry mode. But no its even better than that Not only is Jackson angry but hes also a Los Angeles police officer which means he carries a gun and is regarded as a citizen beyond reproach. And he has floodlights all over his property so that the lights shine through the bedroom of his neighbors house. And he wont turn them off. Abel takes an immediate dislike to the neighbors when he sees that theyre an interracial couple. Lisa (Kerry Washington) is black and Chris (Patrick Wilson) is white. When Abel meets Chris he makes little digs shifting between ambiguous hostility and Jacksons own patented variety of stone-cold geniality. When he hears Chris listening to hip-hop he tells him ""You can listen to that noise all night but when you wake up in the morning youll still be white."" Thirty-five or 40 years ago Sidney Poitier might have played the young husband married to a white woman and Rod Steiger or someone equally combustible would have been cast in the Jackson role. That a black actor gets to play the race-obsessed angry man might be considered some sign of progress but as a story ""Lakeview Terrace"" is pretty much by the book. Cant we all get along here? Three guesses. The fun of ""Lakeview Terrace"" is not in what happens but in how it happens. The fun is in gauging Abels rage as well as his thinking and in enjoying Jacksons virtuosity. As a director LaBute knows exactly the hand hes playing with this film. He knows that he has a plot that just rearranges and recombines some suspense movie cliches but he also knows he has some smart unsettling dialogue a handful of strong scenes and three good actors in the lead roles. Further he knows that his movie will succeed if he does two things if he lets Jackson be scary and if he has Jacksons co-stars look frightened. To that end LaBute photographs Jackson straight on looking into the camera. He punctuates scenes with Jacksons glances every one some version of menace. Watching Jackson the audience experiences the double kick that sometimes happens with familiar film stars We get taken up in the action of the character even as we take specific delight in the movie stars laying out his bag of tricks for our pleasure. Without Jackson it would be difficult to imagine ""Lakeview Terrace"" adding up to anything. With Jackson we believe in the terror of the characters and feel on a gut level what theyre up against. At one point our hero (Wilson) thinks someone has invaded his house so he picks up a lacrosse stick as a weapon and starts waving it. Oh the hopelessness of that tableau - to think he can go up against Samuel L. Jackson armed with just a lacrosse stick. -- Advisory This film contains sexual situations and violence.

Jackson in ""Lakeview Terrace."" Lakeview Terrace. (PG-13) Screen Gems (110 min.) Directed by Neil LaBute. With Samuel L. Jackson Patrick Wilson Kerry Washington. Now playing in New Jersey. THREE STARS The evil that men do. Thats been the focus of Neil LaButes career ever since he made his first film ""In the Company of Men"" about two yuppies who break the heart of a disabled girl just because they can. Subsequent movies (and plays) like ""The Shape of Things"" ""Your Friends and Neighbors"" and ""Fat Girl"" did little to lessen the dark mood. And things are no less vicious in ""Lakeview Terrace."" Thats a good thing actually -- LaBute doesnt do optimism at least not very well. His oddly dreamy ""Nurse Betty"" never quite connected with audiences and ""Possession"" was a dreary romance. And as for genre films -- well the less said about ""The Wicker Man"" the better. But in ""Lakeview Terrace"" -- which has LaBute working from someone elses script -- hes back to bad. The story revolves around some young marrieds Chris and Lisa who have just begun to set up house when they meet their new neighbor. His name is Abel and hes a strict father and a real law-and-order guy. In fact hes a cop -- a proud African-American who tries to model acceptable behavior for the entire neighborhood. And the fact that Chris is white and Lisa is black is something Abel finds unacceptable. Luckily the script (by David Loughery and Howard Korder) and LaButes direction are both smart about how they develop this. Abels harassment doesnt start with ""Cape Fear""-style terror -- just an unneighborly act here a brusque word there. Theres nothing the couple could ever go to the cops about and if they did who would believe them? As Lisas father tells them Abel has color on his side Blue. And meanwhile an out-of-control blaze burns in the distance and the clouds of smoke grow ever closer -- a moving metaphor for the fire this time. The picture is well cast too with the corn-fed Patrick Wilson as the desperately confused Chris and the underrated Kerry Washington as Lisa doing a good job of conveying the small silences and misunderstandings of a new marriage. Things are already beginning to crack; the outside threats only widen the fissures. (LaButes subject as always is the small selfish impulses even ""nice"" people carry around inside.) Best here though is Samuel L. Jackson as Abel. Jackson has always had one of the greatest advantages any serious actor can -- he does not care whether you like him or not. (He couldnt have done ""Black Snake Moan"" if he did.) And so he embraces this reactionary man without any wink to the audience and brings to him all of his own very singular talent for menace and invective. (Hearing Samuel L. derisively call someone ""sugar britches"" is an unexpected highlight.) Abel is so fascinating -- even contradictory -- that its a shame when the movie tries to simplify him. A late ""explanation"" for why he hates interracial couples is a little pat; a party scene which brings politics into it and contrasts Abels conservative views with the liberal ones of his neighbors is similarly facile. To try to explain or pigeonhole Abel is to dilute him -- its the unknowable nature of his malice that makes him truly frightening. And makes ""Lakeview Terrace"" an unsettling address for everyone -- black white or ""blue."" Rating note The film contains violence racial epithets substance abuse and sexual situations.

Not really says ""Lakeview Ter race"" in which racial frustration throbs like a busted toe even in a suburban LA neighborhood. Soon after an interracial couple Chris and Lisa (Patrick Wilson and Kerry Washington) move in next door to a black cop Abel Turner (Samuel L. Jackson) things get touchy. Like 1965 Watts touchy. Abels floodlights blast through their windows and hes dismissive when asked if he could turn down the wattage. The couples car suffers a mysterious attack as does their air conditioner. In LA this counts as a double amputation. It turns out Abel is angry because the couple in their swimming pool went at it like two contestants in ""The Bachelor"" in full view of his kids. Nor does he appreciate Chris flicking his cigarette butts into his yard. The movie is basically told from a white point of view but for its first two-thirds at least it avoids most traps. It doesnt cop out with a white-liberal-guilt message about the dangers of mistrusting your neighbor (Abel really is hostile) but doesnt demonize anyone either. Abel whose wife is dead has good reason to be on edge. (Also Chris went to Berkeley on a lacrosse scholarship and if that isnt just cause for a campaign of psychological torture I dont know what is.) Abel is technically within his rights to for instance lop off tree branches that cross into his property. At times Chris does the same thing to the olive branches that Abel extends the other way. Despite being the audience surrogate Chris is kind of a jerk. Director Neil LaBute (who didnt write the picture) delights in upending liberal pieties in his stage plays and he bakes up unease and suspense while dramatizing difficult questions. Is it racism or pride that makes a black person wish other blacks would date within the race? (If it is racism what about when Jews take a similar stance?) Is it wrong of Chris to see a connection between Abels behavior and the chilly reception he gets from his father-in-law? Is Abel just an angry lout or a racist and does it make a difference? ""Lakeview Terrace"" holds your interest though the bad faith on all sides makes it something of an endurance test. Whats more unfortunate is a turn for the literal (shades of ""Do the Right Thing"") when wildfires threaten to burn down both houses. The third act isnt altogether implausible but it seems borrowed from a lesser thriller. When one character goes too far it becomes too easy for the audience to choose a side. LAKEVIEW TERRACE Hate thy neighbor. Running time 106 minutes. Rated PG-13 (Violence sexuality profanity drug references). At the E-Walk the Orpheum the Magic Johnson others.

Jackson star in Lakeview Terrace. Joe Neumaier Thursday September 18 2008 1036 PM The neighbor-from-hell genre is really as tiresome as well neighbors. It was worse in the late 80s and early 90s after such movies as ""Neighbors"" ""The burbs"" and ""Pacific Heights."" ""Duplex"" was the most recent addition to this overcrowded estate and now Neil LaBute tries to layer ""social content"" onto it with ""Lakeview Terrace"" - and the same boring routine gets played out again.PHOTOS MOVIES NOSIEST NEIGHBORSLaButes films as a writer-director never capitalized on ""In the Company of Men"" his still-cutting 1997 study of misanthropy and misogyny. ""Your Friends and Neighbors"" (1998) was an intriguing followup but since then its been ""Nurse Betty"" ""Possession"" and ""The Wicker Man."" (Onstage hes been a more successful provocateur with ""The Mercy Seat"" ""Fat Pig"" and ""The Shape of Things"" the latter becoming a toothless 2003 movie.)So ""Terrace"" (written by David Loughery and Howard Korder) pretends to be about the persecution of a mixed-race couple when really its about how anyone might react living next door to the shark from ""Jaws."" The relentless motiveless machine here is Abel (a glowering Samuel L. Jackson) an LAPD officer who unofficially patrols his corner of a comfy cul-de-sac in the San Fernando Valley. When Lisa and Chris (Kerry Washington and Patrick Wilson both likable but unengaging) move next door Abel disrupts their lives sabotages their air conditioning and generally lets them know he doesnt like them.Theres not much more to the movie than that. As usual any suspense comes from seeing how unneighborly the crazy neighbor will get and how violent the faceoff will be. LaButes crass use of Lisa and Chris mixed marriage as a flash point feels dated and forced and the backstory the movie gives for Abels being incensed at it - involving his late wife - is lazy. Even some of Abels ""outrageous"" acts (tricking Chris into a lap dance at a bachelor party cutting down some shrubs) fall a long way short of shocking.The one thing about ""Lakeview Terrace"" that isnt lazy is Jackson. Always thinking always towering he imbues Abel with more humanity than the script probably ever did and he does it simply with a mere glance or inflection. Abel is raising two kids alone hes a tough cop whose street smarts save lives he has worked hard to get where he is. Its a shame the movie insists on turning him into a one-dimensional monster.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post It has taken until now to consider the irony in the title of ""Lakeview Terrace"" the volatile new drama about authority race and ego starring Kerry Washington Patrick Wilson and Samuel L. Jackson as neighbors at odds. Lakeview Terrace is the name of the suburban Los Angeles neighborhood to which newlyweds Lisa and Chris Mattson (Washington and Wilson) move from northern California. Only there is no lake in sight and no bucolic view amid the hills which throughout much of the film burn at a distance. Like subdivisions named ""Orchard"" or ""Grove"" the moniker likely denotes something that was gone with the first load-lifter. Just as the distant hills burn the story smolders. Directed by Neil LaBute from a screenplay by David Loughery and Howard Korder ""Lakeview Terrace"" is most intriguing when it simmers with interpersonal tensions. Once those tensions are set ablaze in a final-act escalation it falters. Nastiness between friends neighbors and co-workers is something LaBute (""In the Company of Men"" ""Your Friends and Neighbors"") has handled and manhandled interestingly over the years. He does both here. From the start assumptions are teased. The audience is meant to wonder which belong to the characters and which were brought into the moviehouse in the historical baggage of our fraught American lives. Lisa tours the property with a distinguished older black man -- her doting father it turns out. Next-door neighbor Abel Turner an LAPD cop assumes the worst when he spies Chris and Lisa stealing a kiss. Later hell use the fact that his children saw the young marrieds making whoopie in their pool as fuel for his hostilities. When Abel leans into a neighbors car window to chat you know he has the capacity for kindness. He digs his neighbor who happens to be Asian. The feeling is mutual. He has a steady-sturdy relationship with his partner in blue Javier (Jay Hernandez). But a shakedown of a sloppy wannabe informant suggests that Abel has little patience for white men who pose as street as hip-hop gangstas. Chris fondness for hardcore rap is just another strike against him. And when Abel leans into Chris Prius to say howdy you see that he has the capacity for alpha-dog menace. Jackson continues to refine his approach to characters shaped by anger (""Black Snake Moan"" for example) which is one reason the monstrous developments late in the thriller aggravate. Its not for lack of talent but Wilsons character is the least compelling member of the triangle. Perhaps thats the point -- or one of them. What bigot ever truly engages the nuance of another persons life? Washington brings the freshest insight to the drama. Some of her richest scenes come when her quasi-bohemian character interacts with Abels children especially his rebellious teen daughter Celia (Regine Nehy). Certainly one of the most chilling exchanges unfolds when Lisa faces down a threatening Abel with Celia standing nearby. ""Lakeview Terraces"" resistance to being one thing suggests the time has come when a movie featuring an interracial couple can no longer be merely about race and racism.Abels fury may be shaped by historical affronts but his bigotry is more personal than that. Chris and Lisas marriage may face hurdles of the ""Guess Whos Coming to Dinner"" variety. But just as many are the familiar challenges of modern new marriages when to have children when to accept the fiscal help of in-laws when to let your mate play good cop to the neighborhoods really bad cop. OK not all of us face that last one. ""Lakeview Terrace"" PG-13 for intense thematic material violence sexuality language and some drug references. 1 hour 46 minutes. Directed by Neil LaBute; written by David Loughery and Howard Korder; photography by Rogier Stoffers; Samuel L.

Jackson is at his menacing best in this Hitchcockian tale of slow-boiling racial tension.  |  out of 4 stars By Colin Covert Star Tribune September 20 2008 -- 715am Sony Chuck Zlotnick Lakeview Terrace Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Aside from sapphire swimming pools there is no water in sight of Lakeview Terrace a tidy cul-de-sac development in suburban L.A. Instead just beyond the drop-off there are canyons of tinder-dry scrub and distant growing wildfires. Even before the story begins a pall of menace hangs over the cliff-side community. The conflagration ignites when newlyweds Chris and Lisa Mattson (Patrick Wilson Kerry Washington) spark a war of nerves with their formidable next-door neighbor. Abel Turner (Samuel L. Jackson) is a vindictive Los Angeles patrolman determined to make life hell for the newcomers. Chris and Lisas crime? Their interracial marriage. The battle lines are drawn early as Abel peers at the Mattsons from an upstairs window framed in a sinister close-up that tells us all we need to know about his tightly wound personality. As a cop hes a protector of the social order but Abels version of that pact is warped by old slights and simmering resentments. When he smiles at Chris and Lisa its one of those patented Sam Jackson smiles confident in command menacing maybe hiding something maybe up to no good anything but genial. He begins a cat-and-mouse game of making their lives difficult shining a searchlight in their bedroom window messing with their air conditioning but always covering his actions with plausible deniability. As the pitch rises from unpleasant to unbearable Chris bends over backward in the name of diplomacy both because hes the lets-be-reasonable type and because hes wary of displaying any racial animosity in front of his African-American wife. A master of street guile Abel sizes up Chris insecurities and batters them mercilessly belittling his manhood and endangering his home until he has Chris wobbling precariously off the rails. Abel knows all about the LAPDs rules on deadly force. All he has to do is provoke Chris to fight back. We havent seen a thug with a badge this mesmerizing since Denzel Washingtons Oscar-winning turn in ""Training Day."" Slick savvy and well executed ""Lakeview Terrace"" is a typical studio release polished to a blinding sheen thanks to a superior cast and Neil LaBute Americas most dazzlingly gifted un-famous film director. With Hitchcockian pacing and slow-building tension LaBute probes deeper into the characters of Abel Chris and Lisa than your standard nerve-twister. The film deftly adds shades of gray and psychological depth giving the scripts melodramatic machinations exceptional pull. We can second-guess almost every twist but we want to see how it happens to these compelling characters. LAKEVIEW TERRACE  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for intense thematic material violence sexuality language and some drug references.

Jackson stars as one nasty neighbor. ABOUT THE MOVIELakeview Terrace  (out of four)Stars Samuel L. Jackson Patrick Wilson Kerry Washington Jay HernandezDirector Neil LaButeDistributor Screen GemsRating PG-13 for intense thematic material violence sexuality language and some drug referencesRunning time 1 hour 46 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Anyone who has ever had an annoying neighbor will see their worst nightmares fulfilled in the overheated but entertaining Lakeview Terrace. Samuel L. Jackson plays a fearsome neighbor from hell. Not only is he a menacingly angry man who vents his bitterness in increasing bouts of irrationality but he seems to have the law on his side. Hes a cop besides being an overbearing father and an off-putting party guest. CLIP Take a look at Lakeview Terrace The movie is better than the stock thriller that ads would suggest but by the end it devolves into standard-issue potboiler. Its a flawed suspense drama but an ambitious one that delves often unflinchingly into issues of race politics and class. Jacksons performance is mesmerizing. Patrick Wilson is a bit of a lefty cliche a Berkeley grad who drives a Toyota Prius works for an environmentally conscious grocery chain and listens to rap music. Jackson is stereotypical as well playing a right-wing LAPD tough guy. Theres a ""Cant we all just get along?"" Rodney King reference in the dialogue and the films title also is an allusion to that event. Lakeview Terrace is the area in Los Angeles where Kings 1991 altercation with the police took place. The only one who seems not as categorizable is Kerry Washington who plays Wilsons wife. Jackson a domineering single dad resents the free-thinking interracial couple. One of the best scenes is also one of its subtler ones. In an early effort to be neighborly the couple invite him to a housewarming party where he puts off the guests by belittling their political views and growing aggressive when one of the guests registers disgust. Director Neil LaBute (In the Company of Men) has explored misogyny sexism and infidelity in his films so tackling racism seems logical. But while the story might spur discussion on an important subject the film ends up following a formulaic route. As social commentary it doesnt go deeply enough and as a psychological thriller it peters out in silliness.

Its an understandable request - a plea really - coming from a guy whos moved with his wife into a cul-de-sac McMansion in a hilltop complex in Los Angeles and whos getting nothing but hostility and grief from his next-door neighbor. In essence your standard-issue neighbor-from-hell thriller Lakeview Terrace has been painted over with a layer of Crash-like social commentary. The catch to this predictable business which has been directed by the famously misanthropic Neil LaBute (working this time with somebody elses script) is that the handsome new couple on the block are interracial Chris Mattson (Patrick Wilson) is white Lisa Mattson (Kerry Washington) is black. Their neighbor a widower a single dad with two daughters a veteran LAPD officer named Abel Turner is played by African American movie star Samuel L. Jackson. For whatever reason the sight of a white guy and a black woman disturbs Abel to no end. From Day 1 he makes things unpleasant for Chris. By Day 3 its a full-on assault. And who are the Mattsons going to call? The cops? For a while LaBute and his cast manage to stir up legitimate tension with Abels passive-aggressive tactics and ""friendly"" sidewalk chats. Chris pulling up in the driveway after a day of work his car stereo system blasting gets this from Abel leaning into the window ""You can listen to that rap music all night long. In the morning youll still wake up white."" But although theres effort made to explain Abels bigotry - hes stressed out on the job hes stressed out at home trying to raise two girls - its not enough to compensate for the stereotyping going on all around. Wilson who was so compelling in the disturbing suburban drama Little Children never rises above Bland White Guy caricature as Chris. The beautiful Washington has less luck with her Lisa Her job - she works at home - is never defined nor is her personality. The Mattsons are just your typical young upwardly mobile couple in pursuit of the American dream. Ho-hum. Lakeview Terrace tries to use one of Southern Californias periodic droughts and the ensuing wildfires as a metaphorical backdrop to create a mood of unnerving dread. But by the time the films frantic far-fetched climax comes along - a night involving a gun strippers humiliation and a home invasion gone seriously awry - Lakeview Terraces pretense at exploring racial intolerance has been exposed for what it really is a B-movie copout.

"Lakeview Terrace | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; lakeview-terrace ) Lakeview Terrace (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli Robert Frost famously wrote ""Good fences make good neighbors"" and thats one of the first phrases that comes to mind while watching Lakeview Terrace the latest thriller from Neil LaBute. LaBute began his filmmaking career with the scathing In the Company of Men but his previous effort was the deservedly reviled remake of The Wicker Man. While Lakeview Terrace isnt as horrendous as The Wicker Man its nowhere close to the level LaBute attained with his debut. The first two-thirds of Lakeview Terrace offer a little more subtlety and complexity than the seemingly straightforward premise would afford but the climax is loud dumb generic and over-the-top. Those hoping for something more interesting will be disappointed by the level to which the filmmaker stoops to get an unearned visceral rush. In pandering to Hollywood standards about how stories like this should unfold LaBute has lost his edge. Lakeview Terrace is a small ethnically diverse Southern California community where Chris and Lisa Mattson (Patrick Wilson and Kerry Washington) have chosen to purchase their first home. Its a nice property with a small yard and a pool in the back. Their next door neighbor is Abel Turner (Samuel L. Jackson) a single father cop whose two children would describe him as ""strict"" and whose personality is intimidating. Abel takes an almost instant dislike to Chris and Lisa. To begin with theyre an interracial couple - something he doesnt agree with. His disenchantment with them grows when he and his kids spy them frolicking naked in their pool. From that moment he decides theyre not right for Lakeview Terrace and begins a covert campaign of psychological warfare to encourage them to move. For Chris and Lisa calling the cops is out of the question since Abel is a 28-year veteran of the LAPD. The cat and mouse game between Abel and the Mattsons is the area in which Lakeview Terrace can most accurately be described as compelling. Its not groundbreaking stuff but LaBute handles it effectively. We also see facets of the characters that might not be revealed in a more straightforward handling of a similar story. Attempts are made to flesh out Abel as more than just a wacko cop with a chip on his shoulder. We see that hes trying to be a good father and we learn a little about the circumstances of his wifes death. The movie also illustrates some of the difficulties inherent in an interracial marriage especially when family members and neighbors are not enamored with the situation. Abel is not the only one in Lakeview Terrace to dislike the union of a black woman and a white man. For a while it looks like Samuel L. Jackson will be playing a toned-down version of his usual self. When were introduced to Abel he comes across as a God-fearing buttoned-down man who avoids profanity and the appearance of impropriety. Over the course of the film however Abel becomes a more typical Jackson personality descending to the point where hes snarling sneering and virtually foaming at the mouth. The films last fifteen minutes are so over-the-top that theyre almost impossible to take seriously and Abels motivation during a critical sequence near the conclusion is difficult to fathom. Its the kind of thing that results from a screenwriter not knowing how to end a movie. Considering that the screenwriter in question is David Loughery the man who was in part responsible for Star Trek V The Final Frontier perhaps this shouldnt be surprising. Meanwhile Patrick Wilson and Kerry Washington are okay as the couple in the crossfire but in comparison to Jackson theyre boring. Thats the problem with sharing the screen with a man whos a force of nature. The film includes a subplot about the California wildfires that serves little purpose beyond adding a little smoke to the inter-character fires that explode in the final act. The films creation of these fires which begin in the distance then gradually come closer as the picture moves along are representative of pretty good special effects but its hard to understand what their purpose is if not to distract viewers from the growing ridiculousness of the neighborhood conflict as it escalates beyond the bounds of credulity. After all if the neighborhood is going to be reduced to a pile of ashes who cares whether the people living there get along with each other? There are times when Lakeview Terrace seems to be striving for something more interesting than the basic ""cop from hell"" movie but any pretensions it may have of escaping this orbit come crashing down as the script veers more and more into generic territory. Going in you might think you know how its going to end and youd probably be right. If LaBute sews some doubts along the way its a testament to the way the first half of the film is constructed. Its too bad the movies moderately intriguing qualities are buried under the final half-hours avalanche of predictability. Lakeview Terrace (United States 2008) Director Neil LaBute Cast Samuel L.

Jackson plays a Los Angeles police officer whose beaming smile never hides the fact that hes strung tighter than a tennis racket. Even when he laughs he seems like he could go off at any moment. Jacksons Abel Turner is a widower who lives in a handsome manicured neighborhood with his two children. He patrols the streets at night acting as a self-appointed guardian. Things seem relatively peaceful until a couple move in next door. Chris Mattson (Patrick Wilson of Hard Candy) and his wife Lisa (Kerry Washington of Ray) are pleasant enough but they instantly land on Abels bad side. One big reason Abel doesnt approve of interracial marriage something he constantly needles Chris about. Initially Chris and Abel start out with minor annoyances. Chris leaves cigarette butts in Abels yard; Abels backyard floodlights shine into the couples bedroom. Things unravel further as relations between Abel and the couple become more strained. The unease grows as Chris and Lisa deal with marital problems and Abel is disciplined at work for his hard-hitting tactics. To top it off wildfires are nearing the neighborhood adding an escalating sense of dread to the proceedings. The movies premise is suitably nerve-wracking and hits close to home Who hasnt had to deal with a slightly whacked neighbor at some time? The addition of the law-enforcement angle is a clever twist. The couple feel helpless in the situation and we can see why. Director Neil LaBute (Your Friends amp; Neighbors) is subtle enough that the differences between the two households initially seem like they could be mere misunderstandings. He also works with the cast to create characters that are three-dimensional. Abel is stressed but thats also understandable. Hes an LAPD cop raising two children alone; you figure the guy would be slightly off-kilter. Unfortunately while LaBute masterfully creates an increasing tension the movie fails to follow through at the climax. The final confrontation is predictable and out of character with the rest of the film. You want the movie to end with a big flourish; instead it sort of peters out. Thats a shame.

Jackson Is the Cop Next Door Wednesday September 17 2008 at 659 p.m. By Scott Foundas 1 Your enemies and neighborsChuck Zlotnick A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Earlier this year when I found myself assigned to jury duty on a drug-related trial at Los Angeles Superior Court our jury foreman turned out to be a blond blue-eyed protein-shake-guzzling reality-TV producer from the bedroom community of Altadena. During the jury-selection process when the judge asked if he had any particular positive or negative feelings about the police the producer responded that he was very pleased with the work of the LAPD which had helped to rid his neighborhood of some unsavory characters prone to ""smoking marijuana and listening to hip-hop"" at unconscionable hours of the day and night. This in turn elicited rolled eyes and an audible huff from a young African-American man also seated in the jury box. Lakeview Terrace is a movie that lives in such moments.At first glance it may puzzle followers of dramatist and occasional filmmaker Neil LaBute (In the Company of Men The Shape of Things) that the American stages crown prince of psychosexual power plays and the postcoital mind fuck has opted to follow his universally mocked 2006 remake of The Wicker Man by working as a director for hire on a yuppies-in-peril thriller that seems about two decades past its freshness date. But peer beneath Lakeview Terraces lurid exploitation-movie surface and you will find a vintage LaBute proposition -- a taut three-hander that explores the space between surface appearances and realities between what people say and what they really think. Set in the titular San Fernando Valley suburb -- the one where Rodney King was assaulted by police in 1991 -- the movie is about the troubles that arise when a newlywed interracial couple moves in next door to a widower African-American cop with three decades of service under his belt. There goes the neighborhood.Lakeview Terrace begins with a shrewd moving-in scene during which LAPD officer Abel Turner (Samuel L. Jackson) glances out his window over the septic tank at the new arrivals and briefly mistakes Chris Mattson (Patrick Wilson) the jocular white husband of Lisa (Kerry Washington) an alluring well-dressed black woman for one of the movers. A bit later they meet-cute in the driveway -- Mattson smoking a covert cigarette behind the wifes back while rap music blares from his iPod until Turner taps on his car window flashlight in hand. ""You can listen to that noise all night long but when you wake up in the morning youll still be white"" the cop says before uttering a forced chuckle.Things only get more Pacific Heights from there Turners megawatt security lights illuminate the Mattson bedroom like a football field; air-conditioner wires are not-so-mysteriously cut in the dead of summer; tires are slashed. When someone breaks into the young couples garage in the middle of the night Mattson arms himself with his college lacrosse stick before running downstairs to investigate. Can you get any whiter than that? Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat. Sep. 10 1200pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On the CW Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm Because its being marketed as a run-of-the-mill psycho-cop romp Lakeview Terrace will likely be judged by many critics and audiences exclusively on those terms. And as a suspense picture its merely ho-hum LaBute being the sort of director like his fellow playwright-filmmaker David Mamet who possesses only the most rudimentary know-how about the tools of cinema. (When he really wants to emphasize something he cuts to a close-up and adds a musical sting on the soundtrack.) But like a lot of better genre fare Lakeview Terrace uses its predictable premise to mount a stealth attack on the audiences sensibilities. Written by David Loughery and Howard Korder this may be the perfect movie for the political moment in that its about peoples latent prejudices -- the ones they dont admit to in mixed company or perhaps even acknowledge to themselves but which can follow them into the voting booth. Wilson in particular is very good as the Chicago native who went to Stanford on an athletic scholarship and despite fancying himself an open-minded liberal carries himself with an air of smug WASP privilege. He moves across the screen with the blissful self-confidence of someone whos never known what it means to be glared upon with innate suspicion. Watching him we understand how an Abel Turner might take umbrage.Lakeview Terrace never quite realizes when enough is enough weighing down the narrative with an overly symbolic brushfire that threatens our picture-postcard suburbia giving Jacksons character a wholly unnecessary back story and culminating in an over-the-top finale full of ethereal light and crucifixion poses. But along the way its one of those rare American movies about race in which things arent black or white but only shades of gray. Rather deftly Lakeview Terrace even gives us a car crash or two though they dont bring any of the movies characters closer to a shared understanding. Cant we all just get along? LaBute doesnt deign to pretend that he knows the answer.

"battle for terra 3d movie review - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Battle for Terra 3D -- 2 out of 5 stars Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Battle for Terra is a 3D oddity thats a war movie grafted onto an anti-war message. Naive but ambitious it comes across as a Battlestar Galactica vetted by pacifists Clone Wars neutered for Saturday morning kids TV.Earth and its colonies have been destroyed by the polluting feuding resource-looting human race whose survivors are now confined to a vast clockwork space ark that is breaking down and running out of supplies. The humans scout a planet that might be suitable for ""terra-forming""  having its atmosphere adjusted to let humanity breathe. But once they do that the ancient peaceful and seemingly primitive civilization of flying mermaids who live there will die. Their flying whales and even the gigantic mushrooms they live in will croak too. A ""Terran"" is seized on a scouting mission by the humans. An Earth Force warrior scout (Luke Wilson) crashes and is left behind. Will Mala (Evan Rachel Wood) the daughter of the kidnapped Terran save the human and free her dad? Can the ""us or them"" humans be reasoned with?Gen. Hammer (Brian Cox well cast) is determined to shoot first and maybe build a nice memorial to the people destroyed later. The Terran leader (James Garner) is more an aged hippy  ""Love and mercy can triumph over hate and violence."" The grown-up themes in the film suggest Japanese anime with death sacrifice and suicide touched on in its 80-plus minutes. On the other side theres the cutesy ""helper"" robot who serves as intermediary between the races. Theres little thats subtle here. Messages are delivered with a capital ""M.""The production team tries to have its peace and blow it up too. For ""gentle"" people the blandly written  a Poohs Heffalump screenwriter -- and blandly animated Terrans have soldiers and weapons aplenty. The third act is one epic dogfight.The 3D adds little to this animation which bears more than a passing resemblance to the computer-animated Delgo of last year. Visually Terra is only as good as its Star Wars tribute battle. But in making animation that isnt dark enough for older fans and is too message-centric for kids Team Terra has created a film that will probably satisfy no one.

By Anthony Lane Annette Bening Meg Ryan and Eva Mendes in a remake of George Cukors movie.   Credit LARA TOMLIN The funniest thing about ""The Women"" is that Mick Jagger is one of the producers. There was a knowing laugh in the theatre as his name sprang up in the opening credits--our last chance to laugh as it turned out for the next two hours. The movie written and directed by Diane English is a rehash (or more simply a hash) of the George Cukor picture of 1939 which was written by Anita Loos and Jane Murfin who adapted it from Clare Boothe Luces play. The old film was famous for featuring no men whatsoever and the latest version maintains the trick. Everybody is female fellow-diners New York passersby and merciless hailers of cabs. Only in the closing scene is a person of the opposite sex allowed to emerge and its not Mick Jagger. He was probably lolling backstage away from the action licking his lips. Meg Ryan plays Mary Haines wife of the invisible Stephen Haines and mother of preteen Molly (India Ennenga). Marys best friends are Sylvie Fowler (Annette Bening) a magazine editor who fears for her job and Edie Cohen (Debra Messing) who has three little girls and another child on the way. You can already hear the squeaks and grinds as the various figures are shunted into position; this is one of those movies in which human beings instead of being drawn as living souls are defined purely by the social or professional attitudes they happen to represent. Most grimly walled in is Alex Fisher (Jada Pinkett Smith) who stands for blocked bestselling African-American lesbian essayists everywhere. Via the loose mouth of a manicurist Sylvie--followed by Mary herself--learns that Stephen is having an affair with a perfume saleswoman named Crystal Allen (Eva Mendes). In 1939 Crystal was played by Joan Crawford whom another character described as a ""pretty girl"" which is like referring to the M4 Sherman as a nice little runabout. Not only would you write your last will and testament before going to bed with her; one look at those burning eyes and youd think twice before asking her for an atomizer. Mendes makes a more credible vamp and Crystal gets one short speech during a contretemps with Mary that puts the whole film into perspective. The two of them meet while trying on lingerie--Crystal to keep her man on the boil Mary to coax him back. (In any film about solidarity lingerie is the shorthand for emergency sluthood.) ""You have your fancy gardens and your nice houses"" Crystal says and proceeds to chip away at Marys fantasy of marital bliss. Mary who says that she was hoping for a ""transcendental moment of connect"" whatever that might be is floored by the insult but Crystals right. The women in ""The Women"" can afford to treasure their feelings and fuss over their heartbreaks. Theyre rich. Strange to say Cukors version is scarcely more seductive. Unlike his other dramas of fine living such as ""Dinner at Eight"" (1933) or ""The Philadelphia Story"" (1940) it leaves you in a bad mood resentful of its characters. Depression audiences lofted from their cares by the son et lumiere of Katharine Hepburn flaring up at Cary Grant may well have felt their noses being rubbed in it by the twitterings of Rosalind Russell and Norma Shearer in ""The Women"" and so it is with their modern counterparts. ""What do you think this is some kind of nineteen-thirties movie?"" Mary asks her mother Catherine (Candice Bergen) and the answer is No this is some kind of nineteen-eighties movie. The women have no menfolk on show but they have nannies housekeepers gleaming automobiles and spreading lawns on which they host luncheon parties for their pals half of whom treat them like enemies. Their interests are pared to a safe minimum fashion magazines and fashion magazines. Nobody sweats for a living or hungers for one. When Mary separates from Stephen and hits a low she revives herself by taking photographs (cue a closeup of a seven-thousand-dollar Leica) and coloring in sketches of dresses. ""I want to design my own collection"" she admits to her mother who offers to finance it with her own inheritance as yet unused and unrequired. Isnt life grand? Only one thing in ""The Women"" escapes the spit of cattiness and that is not a human being but a store. According to Sylvie ""Nobody. Hates. Saks."" Such is the moral of this film run a close second by ""Dont give a shit about anybody--be selfish"" as delivered by Leah (Bette Midler) a trumpet-voiced movie agent. In short we are back in the land of ""Sex and the City"" and thus with the lurking suggestion that greed--emotional greed not just the material ravenings of the shopper--is the only alternative to the humiliation that comes from subservience to men. No middle way is permitted. Compare this with the split-and-try-again comedies of Hollywoods heyday like ""The Awful Truth"" or ""The Lady Eve"" and you cant help recalling the satisfaction of watching the heroine come out on top not because she had mooched around reflecting on her self-worth or invested that self in handbags but because she had fought like blazes to get there. Real women like Barbara Stanwyck Irene Dunne and Katharine Hepburn scrapped for their power against a society that had no wish to give it up or against hapless dithery males who had no clue what to do with it whereas ""The Women"" of 2008 gives empowerment a bad name. As in ""Sex and the City"" Candice Bergen is the only person here who cracks wise to any effect; everybody else flounders in a mire of soggy lines. A sample ""What do you think she sells Chanel Number Shit?""; ""Your Pradas are ruining my perennials""; ""This place makes Betty Ford look like Disneyland."" Laugh? I nearly slept. The wordplay is matched by the fatigue that pervades both the musical and the visual vocabularies in the opening credits an over-the-river travelling shot of the Manhattan skyline gives way to a closeup of heels and toned calves hymned by a voice singing ""Im Feeling Beautiful."" At the other end of the story I just about clung on consoled by the thought that whatever else Diane English had at least found the decency not to stoop to a birthing scene. Then it was time for the birthing scene. I am aware of the dire paucity of films that appeal to a grownup female audience as opposed to a mob of ten-year-old ""Transformers"" fans but why should discerning viewers of either gender be fobbed off with indolence? Taken together ""Sex and the City"" ""Mamma Mia"" and ""The Women"" add up to a spectacular trilogy of the inane and to point that out is not the prerogative of the misogynist or the killjoy. Its the view of someone who thinks that women deserve better from the movies and who sees no joys to kill. It comes as a shock to realize that in three months time Samuel L. Jackson will turn sixty. We cant think of him growing old just as we cant really imagine that he was ever young. He seemed to arrive on our screens full grown ripe in mind and muscle richly amused and already in possession of his gifts. I love those line readings of his best heard in ""Pulp Fiction""--the diction clear and clipped but the tone swinging up into inquiry at the end of a phrase as if other peoples assumptions were there to be probed. Those jabs come to the fore in Neil LaButes new movie ""Lakeview Terrace."" Jackson plays a seasoned Los Angeles cop with the workmanlike name of Abel Turner--a widower who runs a tight ship to the chagrin of his young son Marcus (Jaishon Fisher) and his teen-age daughter Celia (a terrific performance from Regine Nehy). One day new neighbors arrive a white guy named Chris Mattson (Patrick Wilson) and his wife Lisa (Kerry Washington) who happens to be black. From the word go Abel doesnt like them for some reason and one of the strengths of LaButes film is that for a long while we cant work out what that reason might be. It is mainly but not wholly an aversion to mixed-race marriage; Abel is offended by something else in Chris and Lisa--their liberality and hope or their ignorance of the fractious patch of South Central that he patrols. Generations matter too and this is where Jacksons age counts in uniform he looks beefy and buff but out in his yard slopping about in shorts and sandals he seems to sag. The movie was written by David Loughery and Howard Korder not by LaBute himself though it sounds a lot like him in the lethal simmer of its conversation. (Brace yourself for Abel at the Mattsons housewarming party.) So much is at stake here Chris and Lisas house overlooks a vale of undeveloped land on the uneasy frontier of town and country and there is a wider sense of an urban culture uncertain where to head next. Its a shame then that the later stages of ""Lakeview Terrace"" should overheat and spill into silliness. The plot is compromised not resolved by the pulling of a gun. It was enough that Abel carried one with him at all times. Likewise the barroom scene where he ""explains"" the source of his wrath tends to drain it of threat and as for the forest fires that rage toward the characters quiet road thanks a lot but I think we get the point about racial inflammation. The first hour of the film however with Jackson in command feels dangerous necessary and rife with comic disturbance. Just like the man himself.

Bearing notable similarities to a well-publicized recent case in which a black Los Angeles police officer was accused of serially harassing neighbors -- particularly interracially married ones -- ""Lakeview Terrace"" delivers fairly tense and engrossing drama before succumbing to thriller convention. Samuel L. Jacksons compelling turn as one kind of neighbor almost nobody wants should magnetize some critical favor and aud interest. But as a queasy examination of black/white dynamics poised between character study and genre piece director Neil LaButes latest is likely to score medium B.O. closer to that of 2002s ""Changing Lanes"" than starry hit ""Crash."" Cop Abel Turner (Jackson) the widowed father of two children (Regine Nehy Jaishon Fisher) kept on a tight disciplinary leash is at first just mildly interested when moving vans pull up to the house next door. But his expression changes when a smooch identifies Chris (Patrick Wilson) as husband to Lisa (Kerry Washington) -- and we quickly discern that for whatever reason Abel does not look favorably on a white man and a black woman as spouses. At first Abels nastily instructive sense of humor (he introduces himself to Chris by feigning an armed carjacking) seem just possibly misconstrued. Kept awake each night by Abels security lights glaring into their bedroom window the couple accept his sorry-I-forgot excuses. They dont jump to conclusions when their air-conditioning system appears sabotaged. But by the time someone breaks into their garage and slashes Chris tires Abel has made it crystal-clear he wants them out of the neighborhood -- and that running to his police breathren wont likely help. As relations deteriorate further between the two houses the tension exacerbates already existing conflicts for Lisa and Chris while Abels heavy-handed notions about meting out ""justice"" on the job get him in hot water -- not for the first time apparently. Meanwhile another drought year brings wildfires ever closer to this upper-middle-class enclave. The gradually escalating campaign of harassment humiliations and payback sounds like something LaBute might have written himself. But this time hes just in the directors seat for a screenplay by David Loughery (his first produced in 15 years) and Howard Korder from Lougherys story. Notably the pic was produced by Will Smith and his usual producing partner James Lassiter. If the dialogue and personalities here had aped the savagery of LaButes stage and early screen scripts (""In the Company of Men"" ""Your Friends and Neighbors"") ""Lakeview Terrace"" might have tipped into caricature or at least black-comedy terrain. But the handling on all sides -- most crucially Jacksons -- is judiciously understated. Until the end that is. Coda could be worse but nonetheless disappoints by bringing on mortal home-invasion peril like so many more formulaic thrillers. Theres also a fadeout affirmation of family values that feels knee-jerkingly obvious. Abel is perhaps too mercurial on the written page for full credibility decrying scanty female dress and rap music one minute hosting strippers and a blaring house party the next. Still Jacksons astutely measured turn does a lot to muffle such doubts at least until the viewer has time for hindsight scrutiny. The pic was primarily shot in the affluent L.A. County burg of Walnut (whose population is in fact Asian-American by a slim majority). The widescreen presentation is clean and unfussy recalling the minimalist aesthetic of LaButes first films without quite replicating their severity. The excellent Washington ably fills out a character whos less than fully sketched; less so Wilson whos both solid and indistinct continuing his screen path of being very good in morally ambiguous roles (""Hard Candy"" ""Little Children"") but bland in straight-arrow ones (""The Phantom of the Opera"" ""Evening""). Among the supporting cast only Ron Glass as Lisas father and Nehy as the teenage daughter chafing under Abels rigid control have the space to make a real impression in the tightly focused script.
