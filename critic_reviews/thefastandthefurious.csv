""The Fast and the Furious"" has nothing to do with the 1954 Roger Corman production of the same name but its a picture that would have done the B movie meister proud in any era. A gritty and gratifying cheap thrill Rob Cohens high-octane hot-car meller is a true rarity these days a really good exploitationer the sort of thing that would rule at drive-ins if they still existed. As it is young viewers and working class audiences should still pack in for this smartly made programmer-style Universal release which promises to show renewed acceleration down the line as a home entertainment attraction. Like solid unpretentious Westerns did in a previous era this story of speed-crazy grown-up kids trades shrewdly on many long-established movie conventions Primal passions elemental rivalries testosterone-charged confrontations youthful male preoccupation with top dog status iconic posturing and behavior and the sheer excitement of action. Pared down to the basics Cohens direction and script by Gary Scott Thompson Erik Bergquist and David Ayer keep the picture speeding down the straightaway where it belongs while an attractive cast led by an imposing Vin Diesel keeps the personal scenes quite watchable. Many will consider the pictures pedal-to-the-metal antics a guilty pleasure but they should be persuaded to give up the guilt and enjoy the unostentatious nature of the sort of film that used to be a Hollywood staple but is now in short supply. Point of entry into the world of L.A. street racing is provided by Brian OConner (Paul Walker) the only blond blue-eyed guy in sight amid the multi-ethnic stew of blue-collar Los Angeles. Attracted to lunch counter girl Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster) Brian turns up with his computerized fuel-injected Mitsubishi Eclipse at a nocturnal industrial area to take on Mias brother Dominic (Diesel) the undisputed local champ. Tough and intimidating Dominic is also willing to accord respect where its due and after a blistering race in which Brian almost blows his car apart while giving Dominic a run for his money Dominic welcomes the outsider into his circle much to the consternation of redneck a-hole Vince (Matt Schulze) who also has the hots for Mia. Bonding over their love of cars and both having done time in the joint Dominic and Brian have to contend with one violent enemy Chinese hoodlum Johnny Tran (Rick Yune) whose goons ride around on ""crotch rockets"" or superpowered motorcycles shooting up anything in sight. For Brian however Johnny holds a special interest Brians actually an undercover cop on assignment to infiltrate the street-racing scene in order to nail the culprits responsible for a rash of big-money truck hijackings daring and skilled jobs that would seem to bear Johnnys fingerprints. But as his superiors push Brian to quickly crack the criminal ring the young man becomes more deeply enmeshed in the lives of his new friends. While working a day job at the neighborhoods No. 1 auto supplies outlet he starts fixing up an old junker at Dominics shop in order to repay a debt and launches into a romance with Mia. Vince Brians rival for the latters attention suddenly suspects that Brians a cop; its something Dominic doesnt want to believe but the seed of doubt is planted nonetheless. Once Brians cover is finally blown tempers cross the red line but even then the dramatic dynamics remain nicely conflicted as Brian stepping out of his cops role takes an extreme risk to help Vince of all people escape certain death when the latter is plastered on the cab of a speeding big-rig while the driver is trying to aerate him with a shotgun. Reminiscent of ""The Road Warrior"" without feeling like a ripoff this tense and roaring sequence reps the films action high point although theres even more to come after that as Brian and Dominic must try to settle their complex account. Unlike last years arch phony and sentimental ""Gone in Sixty Seconds"" remake ""Fast"" gets down in an honest and direct manner and at least gives the feel of being rooted in a certain subcultures genuine obsession for hot wheels a preoccupation that defines the characters way of life. The ethnic diversity on view here is so thoroughly mixed as to render conventional labels all but meaningless with the exception of the ""white bread"" represented by Brian. One-dimensional psychological profiles are provided -- notably Dominics youthful trauma of having watched his father die in a racetrack crash -- but nothing is permitted that slows down the forward momentum. Having been noted on the fringes over the last few years -- in ""Saving Private Ryan"" ""Boiler Room"" ""Pitch Black"" and his own indie drama ""Strays"" -- Diesel herein emerges front and center as a strong but intriguingly ambiguous leading man. Shaven-headed and seriously pumped but readily expressing sensitivity and an emotional intuitiveness Diesel conveys a suggestive good-guy/bad-guy combo that augers well for future action roles as well as for more complex parts. Although hes playing the ostensible toughest guy on the block its also amusing to see him express real fear when put in the powerless position of being Brians passenger during some particularly hair-raising driving moments. As the ""snowman"" who must prove himself to the hood-hardened local boys while keeping his true identity a secret Walker simmers strongly in a low-keyed way. Brewster is looking good and doing a better job here than she did as a searching teen in the recent ""The Invisible Circus"" but ""Girlfight"" sensation Michelle Rodriguez is wasted in the thoroughly undeveloped part of Dominics girlfriend; just a day or two of specific concentration on her part in the script stage might have given her something to do but the character is utterly superfluous to the central action. Schulze is menacing as the civility-challenged Vince while Chad Lindberg seems to be channeling Giovanni Ribisi in his role as a geeky mechanics whiz. Cohens direction is all energetic no-nonsense efficiency backed up by rough-and-ready determinedly unslick tech contributions. Score is composed of a combustible combination of techno and hip-hop sounds. The Fast and the FuriousProductionA Universal release presented in association with Mediastream Film of a Neal H.

Comments The Fast and the Furious 101 minutes  2013 Investigating a series of daring truck heists on the LA freeways a young FBI agent (Paul Walker) infiltrates a street-racing crew whose revered leader (Vin Diesel) is a prime suspect. The movie is a knowing throwback to those 50s exploitation flicks about angry teens and their fast cars; director Rob Cohen gamely tries to infuse a contemporary action picture with a vintage B-movie sensibility yet his talent for first-rate action sequences is occasionally undercut by a lazy reliance on frenetic editing and bone-rattling sound. While few of the paper-thin characters register long enough to make much of an impression Diesel carries the movie with his unsettling mix of Zen-like tranquillity and barely controlled rage. With Michelle Rodriguez Jordana Brewster and Ted Levine.

In Los Angeles Brian (Paul Walker) an undercover cop who looks blond and boyish enough to be an understudy for Lance Bass of N Sync and Toretto (Vin Diesel) the hulky speed demon and thief he has been trying to get the goods on are lined up at a stoplight eyeing each other like buzzards. Spontaneously they agree to race to the train tracks that lie a quarter of a mile ahead. As they launch into gone in 20 seconds overdrive a train approaches and the question lingers Who will be the one to chicken out and who will be fearless enough to hit the red dashboard computer button that triggers a nitrous oxide fuel injection rocketing the car ahead with Batmobile fury? The two rivals glance at each other and suddenly with a slight nod of the head they both agree to go for the fuel injection. Theyre going to beat that train - or run smack into it - together. There have been countless auto racing movies from ""Grand Prix"" to ""Heart Like a Wheel"" to ""Driven"" but ""The Fast and the Furious"" is a movie about California Car Culture. Its characters are young and pretty and hip and anonymous enough to look like hangers on at a velvet rope party for the movies premiere and the story is organized around racial tribal patterns as regimented as anything in an early 60s delinquent fable. The drag races here take place in the desert or along midnight L.A. boulevards with baby faced gangland studs speeding for the prize of cash groupies and their own manhood. ""I live my life a quarter of a mile at a time"" says Toretto in the movies most irresistible bad line. ""For those 10 seconds Im free."" Hes enunciating the philosophy of the drag racer though the trouble with drag race movies is that those 10 seconds tend to flash by all too quickly leaving us in the case of ""The Fast and the Furious"" with a logy crime bust melodrama - ""Point Break"" on hot wheels. Standing in contrast to all of the perfectly angled cheekbones is Vin Diesel whose every aspect is thick and round his muscles his lips his close cropped cranium his syrupy basso growl. Diesel can be a powerful actor (he ruled ""Boiler Room"" like a pumped up Miguel Ferrer) but ""The Fast and the Furious"" in trying to make him ""noble"" just ends up bleaching his surly charisma. As for Michelle Rodriguez who appears here in her first major role after ""Girlfight"" Im afraid that her snarl has been candified her presence reduced to a mere tic of attitude. ""The Fast and the Furious"" works hard to be exciting but the movie scarcely lives up to its title. It could have used a bit of a fuel injection itself.

"washingtonpost.com Entertainment Guide Main Page Movies Music Restaurants Nightlife Museums/Galleries Theater/Dance Love Life In Store Outdoors/Fitness  Style  Comics  Crosswords  Horoscopes  Books  Travel  Weather  Traffic  TV Listings Furious Familiar but Fun By Curt Fields Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 22 2001 Vin Diesel and Paul Walker in ""The Fast and the Furious."" (Universal) A frequent cable TV marketing ploy lately is touting the ""guy-ness"" of shows with slogans like ""Movies for Guys Who Like Movies."" If the trend doesnt die ""The Fast and the Furious"" will be getting a lot of air time in a year or so.Its got all of the requisite elements - manly men who live by a code women ranging in type from eye candy to one-of-the-boys tough a few dollops of humor and tricked out pumped up cars. Loosely based on an article in Vibe magazine about the world of import car racing the movie opens with a high-speed truck hijacking featuring souped-up cars darting around and under a big rig while shooting cables into the semis cab so the hijackers can board. Think of the highway scenes in ""Mad Max"" only faster. Then its on to a second high-speed driving scene. Only after that do we get to oh yeah the people who actually turn out to be a reasonably entertaining lot despite living in a story that could have been from some 1950s hot-rod flick. Paul Walker is Brian an undercover cop investigating the truck hijackings. Hes surfer-boy pretty and drives like a maniac. He infiltrates the circle of Dominic (Vin Diesel) a prime suspect. Of course as often happens with undercover cops in movies Brian gets a bit too close to the people hes investigating especially after falling for the alluring Mia (Jordana Brewster) Doms sister. There are other suspects notably Rick Yune in the stereotypical menacing Asian role of Johnny Tran.Other characters along the way include Edwin (Ja Rule providing brief comic relief) and Doms ""team"" of loyal-but-dim Vincent (Matt Schulze) Leon (Johnny Strong) Jesse (Chad Lindberg doing a poor mans Giovanni Ribisi) and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez bringing her ""Girlfight"" spark - and punch - to an otherwise routine role).If youre thinking it sounds familiar it is. But Diesel Brewster and Rodriguez have undeniable charisma while Walker is serviceable in his role. (Hes best in scenes with character actor Ted Levine who plays a police supervisor with amusing Mom-like tendencies.)Besides the cars are the stars. Production Designer Waldemar Kalinowski (""Leaving Las Vegas"" ""Internal Affairs"" ""Powder"") gives the film a vivid look almost caressing racers such as the purple 240SX the yellow Skyline and the red RX7 as they flash past against the softer colors of residential neighborhoods or in contrast with the darkness of the urban night or the light of the desert day. And director Rob Cohen (""Dragonheart"" ""The Skulls"" HBOs ""The Rat Pack"") utilizes an innovation by stunt coordinator-second unit director Mic Rodgers to great effect. Rodgers designed a rig with more speed and maneuverability than the ones usually used to film high-speed scenes giving those in ""The Fast and the Furious"" a more immediate and visceral feel.Cohen also throws in a couple of small twists at the end letting a couple of huge film cliches come rushing up before swerving away at the last second. Such maneuvers may not make for art - actually they dont even make for what many people would call a good movie. But along with the casts charm they provide enough fuel for a fun one.""The Fast and the Furious"" (PG-13 107 minutes) - Contains mild sensuality mild profanity and the sort of driving you shouldnt try at home.

"washingtonpost.com Entertainment Guide Main Page Movies Music Restaurants Nightlife Museums/Galleries Theater/Dance Love Life In Store Outdoors/Fitness  Style  Comics  Crosswords  Horoscopes  Books  Travel  Weather  Traffic  TV Listings Fast Leaving Logic in the Dust By Rita Kempley Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 22 2001 Vin Diesel and Paul Walker in ""The Fast and the Furious."" (Universal) ""The Fast and the Furious"" is ""Rebel Without a Cause"" without a cause. The young and the restless with gas fumes. The quick and the dead with skid marks.This movie is all about whats under the hood bro. More to the point - pop-psychology-wise - its about guys looking under each others hoods. Theres nothing in this world like impressing another dude with your fuel injector. This is macho bonding at 9000 revs.And if you think the cars are fast meet the booty. Every heavy-pedaler wears a garland of freaky hotties all of whom get off on the gear-grinding phenomenon of the outlawed street-racing scene. In other words this is a most excellent film for 12-year-olds and those who are 12 at heart.Its about an FBI agent who goes undercover to find out which street-racing gang is hijacking trucks.Former drag racers will wax nostalgic as the drivers lovingly wax their meticulously detailed souped-up muscle machines. (Lets hope that no kid winds up like a bug on a windshield for attempting one of the movies spectacularly staged stunts like changing lanes by driving under a truck.)But this movie isnt just about reckless speed demons and their garter-belted groupies. Its about young men (and one woman) who have like issues that can be worked out only on the surprisingly desolate streets of Los Angeles. In one case a computer whiz kid was never able to go to MIT because he suffers from attention-deficit disorder.Though these homicidal cretins cruise the highways in roaring squealing glistening chariots by the hundreds the LAPD cant seem to arrest them or stop their illegal races. And thats before they start hijacking the big rigs and making off with the goods. Desperate measures are called for.Enter the FBI. What a brain trust. Although the illegal street-racing community is made up almost exclusively of minorities as portrayed here - the bureau assigns the blue-eyed blond Brian (Paul Walker) to go undercover befriend the tribe and crack the case. To that end Brian demonstrates his skills behind the wheel and soon wins the trust of Dom (Vin Diesel) an ex-con who is the undisputed king of the road hogs.Intermittently Brian reports to his supervisors who are headquartered in a former stars home where they discuss strategy over iced cappuccino. Decaf.The next thing you know the gorgeous hero is invited to a party at Doms house. The host offers Brian a beer ""Its a Corona or nothing"" he quips. (What company wouldnt want its product associated with psycho hooligans?) Brian searches in vain for a lime . . . not really but that would be more surprising than the plots obvious turns.Raise your hands if you think Dom will discover that Brian is an undercover cop. How many think Dom would offer Brian a Corona then?""The Fast and the Furious"" (101 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for sexual content and language.

"USATODAY.com - Car hoods rev up in Fast and Furious Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 06/26/2001 - Updated 0921 AM ET Car hoods rev up in Fast and Furious By Susan Wloszczyna USA TODAY The Fast and the Furious (out of four) Stars Paul Walker Vin Diesel Michelle Rodriguez Jor dana Brewster Director Rob Cohen Distributor Universal Rating PG-13 for violence sexual content and language. When a movie is called The Fast and the Furious you can pretty much expect two things and they arent a tortoise pace and a calm demeanor. Those with the need for speed will be glad to know that this high-grade B flick about illegal street racing among gangs in Los Angeles applies the brakes only for the bare minimum of plot injection. Given what a drag many auto-erotic films can be (like Stallones stalled Driven) this modest little vehicle at least comes loaded with the essential equipment multicultural machismo cutthroat rivalries and a steady supply of daredevil stunts done at 140 mph or more. In a summer already jammed with computer effects its a rare treat to see actual heavy metal flip out of control and go crunch. Read more Video The Fast and the Furious trailer Furious would never qualify as art at least not in any museum outside of Detroit. But those who can relate to the baby-faced engine whiz who suffers from but cant quite say attention deficit disorder will be pleased by the noisy goings-on a full menu of chases races crashes and an especially foolhardy showdown with a train at full chug. If anything it captures the late-night adrenaline rush of an underground sport that requires beating the law as well as your opponents. The story practically cries out for starlit showings at a drive-in circa 1968 with either Peter Fonda or Jack Nicholson behind the wheel. Instead we have the perfectly named Vin Diesel (Boiler Room) as the paternal overlord of a bunch of octane outlaws. If anyone qualifies as the tiger in Furious tank its this Popeye-armed wonder a rebel without a hair who proclaims deep stuff like ""I live my life a quarter-mile at a time."" Earning the admiration and trust of Diesels crack team of hoods is a pretty out-of-towner (Paul Walker of Varsity Blues) who knows how to handle a set of wheels. Below that mop of blond curls however is a cop who is investigating a series of truck hijackings carried out by a mysterious trio of hot-rod Honda Civics. The fact that he has fallen for Diesels sultry sister (Jordana Brewster) complicates matters. Never mind whos behind the highway robberies though. The real question is can Walker squeeze in at least one date before he has to blow his cover and go after the culprits? Director Rob Cohen who has created both the miserable (The Skulls) and the mediocre (Daylight) at least knows how to keep matters moving and the action sequences exciting. Its too bad though that Girlfight sensation Michelle Rodriguez has been reduced to a secondary girlfriend role albeit one that allows her to man a car throw one punch and meow ""I smell skank"" at a pair of Diesel-pawing wenches. You cant say The Fast and the Furious isnt educational. Who knew that these cars are equipped with such sophisticated high-tech controls and use flammable nitrous oxide to provide that extra boost of power? As long as you keep expectations in low gear you just might consider this guilty-pleasure ride to be a real gas.

Starring Paul Walker and Vin Diesel. Directed by Rob Cohen. (VHS and DVD. PG-13. 107 minutes.) The name of the movie is ""The Fast and the Furious."" The cars are fast and the people are furious in this loud action film about the street-racing cults in Los Angeles. Its the kind of movie where a guy sneaks up to hit somebody just as the soundtrack blares a song that goes ""Watch your back/ Watch your back/ Watcho watcho watcho back."" Pandemonium ensues. Its a good movie even though its exactly the kind of movie thats usually awful youth-oriented straining to be contemporary straining to be mythic with no faith in an audiences capacity to stay awake without being jolted. But ""The Fast and the Furious"" has something special about it. Its a formula movie to be sure but its Formula One. Director Rob Cohen infuses the picture with its own overriding tone -- a kind of surreal authenticity if such a thing can be imagined. In its non-racing sections the movie is nicely paced with an eye to keeping the story moving. Its an old story with new characters. Vin Diesel plays Dominic the king of the street racers a natural leader of men with a shaved head and muscles bulging out of his tank top. Paul Walker is Brian a fresh-faced fellow from Phoenix with a handful of secrets. The main thing is he wants to race and find respect on the mean streets. As for the racing scenes they will probably be of interest even to people who drive the speed limit on Interstate 5. The cars are like rockets spitting fire out the tailpipe. The performances are adequate but so charismatic that it doesnt really matter. Diesel is certainly going places. Though at times the thought crosses the mind ""Hold it can this guy act?"" he makes up for it with the look the poise and the growling bass voice of a real original -- and a future star. .

This movie is aimed like a heat-seeking missile at Hollywoods most coveted demographic males between 17 and 24 who have proven that -- given the right material -- they will see an action movie again and again. This probably will be one of them. But theyre not going to get much for their money. This pedal-to-the-metal exhaust-spewing extravaganza has little if any real story line. Screenwriters Gary Scott Thompson Erik Bergquist and David Ayer havent really written a movie theyve followed a formula. Start with a basic mixture of souped-up muscle cars and plenty of hot babes (wet T-shirts included) add a huge dose of testosterone stir in lots of special effects lather on a bunch of car races chases and crashes lay on a pounding soundtrack and voila a perfect escapist movie for kids with cash to spend during the long hot summer vacation. Out in the desert The original idea for ""The Fast and the Furious"" came from an article written by Ken Li for ""Vibe"" magazine. Under cover of darkness a subculture of people mostly ethnic young men and women get together to race customized high-performance subcompact cars along empty streets in Los Angeles and the outlying desert. The prize thousands of dollars per race.

"Fast and the Furious The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; fast-and-the-furious-the ) Fast and the Furious The (United States 2001) A movie review by James Berardinelli Speed adrenaline and a distinct lack of intelligence - those are characteristics that could easily be ascribed to street racing an underground sports phenomenon that keeps the police busy in some communities. The same adjectives can be used to describe The Fast and the Furious Rob Cohens film about crime underground cops and street racing. With a storyline that would be rejected by most undercover cop shows The Fast and the Furious seeks to entertain viewers not by presenting a compelling narrative with well-defined characters but by high-octane car chases that will leave some audiences gasping for breath. As a filmmaker Cohen doesnt have a sterling reputation (two of his more high-profile projects have been The Skulls and Daylight) so it should come as no surprise that The Fast and the Furious is not a model of artistic integrity. The film tells the story of an undercover cop Brian (Paul Walker) who infiltrates a street racing team headed by Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel). But racing isnt all Dominic is suspected of - the cops believe hes the leader of a gang that hijacks trucks. Its Brians job to earn Dominics trust then bust open the crime ring. Unfortunately for Brian he falls for Dominics sister Mia (Jordana Brewster). The story is overly familiar and the characters are all types but Cohens cinematic techniques make The Fast and the Furious watchable. As the title suggests the film never lets up. Its restless and hyperactive jittery and explosive. The movie is no more intelligent than higher-profile dross like Pearl Harbor but its shorter and more fun. This movie has ""guilty pleasure"" written all over it. Its the kind of film you can walk into late immerse yourself in for about 90 minutes then forget about the moment you walk out of the theater. This is popcorn entertainment at its purest. Theres nothing pretentious going on here. In keeping with the MTV-style editing and radioactive camera movements Cohen uses a cast of largely unknown but attractive actors. Top billing goes to Vin Diesel the charismatic baritone who played the convict in Pitch Black and gave the title character its voice in The Iron Giant. Diesel is an actor to watch - he has the potential to go far. Less impressive is Paul Walker (who appeared in Cohens The Skulls) a cookie-cutter Southern California blond with minimal acting talent. Michelle Rodriguez (the lead in Girlfight) uses her snarls and pouts to good advantage as the underwritten Letty Dominics sexy girlfriend. And Jordana Brewster (The Invisible Circus) offers a nice mix of sensuality and innocence. Cohens style consistently shows each actor to his or her best advantage in every scene. Its difficult to write a review of substance about something so vacuous. Really all The Fast and the Furious offers is a bunch of good-looking people racing along streets in cars that go fast faster and fastest. The vehicles look as cool as the men and women driving them. Theres a token bad guy or two a little gunplay and a few pyrotechnics but overall this movie is all about racing. And when it comes to capturing the essence of the sport The Fast and the Furious beats Driven by several laps. Do I recommend the film? Only if youre in the mood for something that will elevate the pulse and numb the mind.
