"The Island Surrounded by Banality on All Sides washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On The Island Surrounded by Banality on All Sides Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson act between the films product placements and special effects. (By Doug Hyun -- Dreamworks Via Associated Press) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 22 2005 Presumably ""The Island"" directed by Michael Bay -- Hollywoods go-to guy for dumbed-down summer popcorn pictures -- is a chilling contemporary cautionary tale in which the obsessive pursuit of genetic perfection and immortality is shown to have heretofore unimagined dystopian ramifications. But in all the rain random events and running around through the blurry chase scenes endless vehicular pileups and big TV-friendly close-ups of Scarlett Johanssons lips and Ewan McGregors mole I could discern only the dimmest plot. And it has something to do with a guy escaping what is either a Washington Metro station or an Ian Schrager hotel and trying to get to the set of ""Survivor."" Thats as far as I can make out. Of course its early yet and somewhere ""The Island"" is still running all 274 hours of it; I had to duck out to make deadline. What am I missing? Another car chase surely or another grisly scene of medical malfeasance whether in the form of implanting tiny crawling robotic critters under someones eyelid or some unsavory business involving a bone saw or yet one more reference to (or rip-off from) ""Blade Runner"" or ""Logans Run"" or ""Gattaca"" or ""Minority Report"" or ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" or ""Austin Powers"" (unintentional but there are scenes featuring McGregors character and his nemesis played by Sean Bean that cant help but conjure Dr. Evil). ""The Island"" unsurprisingly is a clone of other movies about clones and other things. But it derives most of its overproduced aesthetics and flimsy narrative from the beer commercials Bay used to direct; indeed it could still be argued that hes never stopped taking his cues from Madison Avenue -- you know a movie has taken product placement too far when it unironically includes its own lead actresss real-life perfume advertisement. This comes late in the movie when Johanssons character a gorgeous futuristic babe named Jordan Two Delta discovers her identity the reason she was put on the Earth her true purpose in life. The news is not good -- think less Deepak Chopra more Charlton Heston in ""Soylent Green."" When Jordan spies the perfume ad she and her space-age friend Lincoln Six Echo (McGregor) are on the run from said nemesis and his mercenary minions through the streets of downtown Los Angeles which this being science fiction has a fully functional public transportation system. Theyre running from the baddies but midway through they also start running from one movie -- a sleek speculative fantasy in which everyone dresses like an Olympic fencing champion -- into another more conventional action thriller in which the cars may look different but still speed screech smash and blow up in satisfying testosterone-fueled blasts. This is the territory Bay best known for effects-driven no-brainers like ""The Rock"" and ""Armageddon"" clearly feels most comfortable in as he returns to it again and again; McGregor and Johansson -- neither of whom is the first actor youd think of for this kind of trashy summer fare -- are instantly forgettable in roles that essentially amount to not getting in the way of logos for MSN Cadillac Xbox and Nokia. Next to that stuff special effects run a close second in Bays affection and here theyre lavished with all the care and attention to quality that just couldnt be spared for such extras as the script. Theyre admittedly well executed even in those scenes in which McGregor appears with himself; reportedly the ending had to be re-shot with McGregor and Bean not only in separate rooms but in separate countries. Youd never know it but you dont much care either. If you find yourself at ""The Island"" I have only three words of advice Vote yourself off. The Island (127 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for sequences of violence and action some sexuality and profanity.

(DreamWorks/ Doug Hyun) Photo DOUG HYUN Journey to Island means deep questions car chases and cool explosions can coexist 1 / 2 Back to Gallery The Island Science fiction/action drama. Starring Ewan McGregor and ScarlettJohansson. Directed by Michael Bay. (PG-13. 133 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The glass-half-empty way of thinking about ""The Island"" is that its a science fiction movie with a brilliant premise that collapses into a series of amusing but empty action-film cliches. The glass-half-full way is to observe the same thing but to see the film as an unusually amusing action movie with some brains behind it -- brains it doesnt always use well or at all but brains nonetheless. The second way is the better way because it takes the movie on its own terms and on its own terms ""The Island"" is just fine. Yet appreciating it as a piece of propulsive entertainment -- lots of fun and all that -- doesnt preclude wishing that director Michael Bay had trusted the story enough to let it breathe a little. Between car chases and scenes of people hanging off the sides of skyscrapers the movie actually raises some fascinating questions about science morality and the nature of the soul -- questions with lots of contemporary relevance. It raises them but doesnt linger on them and so the balance is off too much meat not enough vegetables. Like all good science fiction movies it takes place in the future in this case about 15 years from now. From what we see at the beginning the United States it seems has become a fascist state in which people live in controlled ""sectors"" underground in order to avoid contact with the earths surface which is contaminated. Their health is monitored. Their diet is controlled. Labor is manual and theyre all forced to wear white jumpsuits. The sexes are kept separate though they can see each other and occasionally wave or say hello. Meanwhile all around them are security guards though who empowers these guards as well as how they fit within the societal structure is not understood or even really questioned. But one citizen -- Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) -- is beginning to question everything. He is wondering about the meaning of his life and hes having tantalizing dreams of being on the sea on a yacht even though he has never been on any kind of boat in his life. He is also having romantic fantasies about Jordan Two Delta but then shes played by Scarlett Johansson so thats only reasonable. Lincoln wants more out of life and for some reason thats considered threatening. In the early minutes of the movie there is much talk about a place called ""the island"" a luxury paradise known as the only uncontaminated place on earth. Admission to the paradise is by lottery. Life inside the sector is in effect controlled by each persons hope of someday making it out. The plot information Ive related here so far is stuff you would know within the first five or 10 minutes of ""The Island."" No more needs to be said though Id be willing to bet that 90 percent of the reviews will give away the entire first hour of the story so dont read them unless you want to know. Its much better to watch the film wondering whats happening and having the nature of this future society gradually revealed. Its very clever. It would be nice to be able to say something more specific than ""very clever"" but this is the rare case where the choice is between writing a better review or preserving the film experience. Though Johansson was lauded for her performance in ""Lost in Translation"" her acting in ""The Island"" constitutes her first truly adult work. Yes she spends half the movie running and some of the rest hanging from buildings -- and her director cares more about demolishing cars than about human interaction -- and yet ""The Island"" constitutes an advance for her. For the time since ""Manny and Lo"" which she made as a child shes listening to her fellow actors and reacting without any apparent consciousness of what her face happens to be doing. The cloud of adolescence is lifting and shes able to be as spontaneous and inspired as she was at 11 years old. As for McGregor its just a pleasure to see him not doing a lukewarm imitation of Alec Guinness. ""The Island"" is a reminder of McGregors roguish charm. Of course to be talking about the acting in a movie like ""The Island"" might be to miss the point. The movie is more about how many things Michael Bay can smash up -- lots. That might not be a talent most people respect but it gets through to people anyway and here Bay does it exceptionally well. -- Advisory This film contains strong language and violence.

A product of the sputtering 70s ""Logans Run"" built dystopia on the squishy Malthusian foundation that the world was running out of everything. The premise of ""The Island"" is far more probable - that long after the last drop of fossil fuel is sucked from the shale there will remain rich lodes of celebrities. Movies instinctively turn real scares into comfortingly phony ones recasting for instance the radical Islamists of ""The Sum of All Fears"" (book version) as neo-Nazis (film version). But in ""The Island"" a sort of Logans rerun that also splices in DNA from ""Minority Report"" and ""Total Recall"" director Michael Bay fills the screen with broken glass by throwing stones at Hollywoods own house. Thats why its his best film since ""The Rock."" Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson play Lincoln Six-Echo and Jordan Two-Delta a pair of innocent pets of a vast system they dont understand. Each is coddled and monitored right down to the morning whiz (Lincolns urinal warns him to keep that sodium down). Germs have they believe wiped out everyone outside this human habitrail yet each night a happy lottery winner is awarded a permanent vacation on a paradise known only as the Island. Lincoln and Jordan dont know it but theyre ""product"" clones grown in pods from scraps of celebrity DNA to supply spare parts. Their world is a flesh farm and theyre as expendable as chickens. The film is set in 2019 but the day when well be asked to swallow some horror or another in the white-coated name of Science may be considerably closer. One of the scripts many fathers is the front page of the paper. That alone makes it a standout among the action-movie clones. Not that the action is an afterthought. Bay is of course less interested in ethics than in flying motorcycles and rotary blades whup-whup-whupping overhead. Those flying motorcycles are pretty freaking excellent by the way especially when they thread a network of el trains in downtown L.A. (I realize this is sci-fi but it does stretch credulity to suggest that workable mass transit will ever come to L.A.) One chase turns into a swipe against the live-forever culture Lincoln attacks his pursuers by unleashing a truckload of industrial spools that look like giant barbells. Aiding Lincoln and Jordan is a mensch played nicely by Steve Buscemi who has some funny asides in a movie where the favorite remark is if I am reading my sloppy notes correctly ""Aaaaaagh"" Or is that ""Aaaggggh""? Some of the plot links are spongy but the central idea plays out with much wit. Its a masterstroke when Jordan discovers one of Scarlett Johanssons actual Calvin Klein perfume ads reminding us that pretty starlets will be first in line when offshore cloning companies start offering to grow a backup you for 5 million. Indeed celebrities are already twirling their batons for the march along this road. McGregor pushing an American accent around as glumly as a toddler trying to hide his peas under his mashed potatoes nevertheless gets a chance to shine late in the frenzy. After ""Down With Love"" ""Big Fish"" and his intergalactically tepid work for George Lucas its shocking to be reminded how brilliant Little Mac was back in the days when no magazine profile failed to call him ""edgy."" Youre a Scot man Stop bollixing up foreign accents and wield the mother tongue with pride.

Jordan Two-Delta (Scarlett Johansson) and Lincoln Six-Echo (Ewan McGregor) make a desperate escape from the facility that once housed them in The Island.

Sigourney Weaver was tough and bristling with haughty energy in ""Alien."" Harrison Ford was as acid as the rain falling throughout ""Blade Runner."" With the sinister fun of ""The Island"" we warmly welcome into the club Ewan McGregor his gleaming track suit and his curious sarcastic gaze. Hes a suspicious young resident of utopia dying to get a taste of an earthier dystopia. Small touches make this tricky business work. Waking up in a polished-metal bedroom an electronic sign immediately informs McGregor he must report to wellness training because of a bad dream. Shrugging it off he heads to the bathroom unzips and is told by the same computer voice that urinalysis indicates too much sodium - no breakfast bacon for you Mr. Futureman. McGregor as Lincoln Six-Echo and his colleagues are wards of a mysterious state an all-knowing administration that has sealed them in a huge building complex because the outside world is supposedly contaminated. They are the only survivors. They are groomed to ""repopulate Eden"" otherwise known as ""The Island"" the only garden spot left on Earth. Elevator ads and ubiquitous TV screens pump the next lottery drawing when the lucky winner gets sent to paradise. Its a welfare and police state in one. Every need is catered to yet residents are forbidden to touch each other and have no clue what sex is. Rebellious thoughts or pointed questions bring reprimands. Something is clearly wrong here especially when Steve Buscemi as a lowly mechanic tells McGregor they shouldnt handle people so roughly because ""Theyre making enough money."" Some reviews and even some of the trailers will tell you more. But director Michael Bay not known for subtlety after ""Armageddon"" and ""Pearl Harbor"" does such a good job of building and exploding the mystery I dont want to give it away. Like the first half of ""Minority Report"" Bays movie creates an entire new world making us believe it and dread it at the same time. McGregor eventually escapes also springing Scarlett Johanssons Jordan Two-Delta. Their search for answers eventually deteriorates into a typical Michael Bay chase movie with helicopters dangling over speeding trucks and motorcycles jumping everything but the Snake River. Its easy to forget the plot as Bay sends train carriages four-story neon signs and burning copters flying at his lenses. Yet they do return to the idea of ""The Island"" and uncovering its conceit. McGregor is a far more interesting action hero here than he was in ""Star Wars"" using his lithe body and knowing wink to seem indomitable if not overwhelming. Johansson is good enough and Sean Bean as an evil doctor overlord makes a crunchy criminal. Buscemi - bless him for never fixing those eyes or those teeth - is the guy who gives the movie soul.

"In answering prayers film explores Russian soul - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Events    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies Movie Review In answering prayers film explores Russian soul By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  October 26 2007 When the people of the small northern Russian community in ""The Island"" need extra-strength prayer or a plain old miracle they head to an Orthodox monastery and take a boat to an unfurnished shack where they plead with Father Anatoly (Pyotr Mamonov) to make it happen. The jurys out on whether he can but hes treated like an oracle anyway. The movie meanwhile is an aggravating combination of piousness arty self-pity and knowing silliness meant to speak to higher spiritual truths.Anatoly is wracked with guilt. During World War II he worked on a barge where Nazis forced him to shoot his captain dead. He survived and was taken in by monks becoming a monk himself. The movie skips ahead to 1976 where we discover that the years have not been kind to Anatolys peace of mind. With all respect to the old mans holiness hes a crackpot. His days include wandering along the frozen shores of the White Sea begging God for forgiveness hauling wheelbarrows of coal playing pranks on his fellow monks and of course dispensing distinctly idiosyncratic advice.Take for example his recommendation to the widow who wants to send a message to her long-dead husband sell her earthly possessions and go west. Her mans alive - in France. How does Father Anatoly know? He goes into another room closes the door and has a conversation with himself.Written by Dmitri Sobolev and directed by Pavel Lounguine this is not a comedy not essentially anyway. Nor is it a true examination of a mans psyche come undone. Lounguines film is about the ravages of guilt - how Anatolys coerced killing has driven him insane. But the characters all of them are so unvarying in their neediness and sorrow that the experience of watching them plead for miracles or redemption is exasperating. The camera gazes at the dilapidation of Father Anatolys hovel (piles of petrified wood near the dock) while the soundtrack with its chorus and twinkling piano conspires to contribute a dint of rising holiness (""aah-aah-aah-aah"") as the Father pushes his wheelbarrow up and down the dock.Lounguines best-known movie here was 1990s ""Taxi Blues"" a bleaker but far richer depiction of human relationships with a much younger-looking Mamonov as a shiftless saxophonist (a former cult rock star he seems positively ancient in this new movie; older than his 56 years). ""Taxi Blues"" also managed to give us a vivid fervent look at modern Soviet Moscow. It was the work of a natural director.""The Island"" seems a lot less certain as a piece of filmmaking. But then again the movie feels less like a character study than a no-frills examination of the Russian soul. In its native country the populace went for it. According to The Washington Post a television broadcast of ""The Island"" in January was second in viewership only to Vladimir Putins New Years Address. (c) Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

If youd prefer not to know anything stop reading now. Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson in ""The Island."" YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Michael Bay Scarlett Johansson Ewan McGregor or Create Your Own Manage Alerts | What Is This? (CNN) -- Love him or hate him -- there doesnt seem to be any middle ground -- Michael Bays movies make big bucks. Even the nearly unwatchable ""Pearl Harbor"" made 198 million dollars. Action junkies i.e. adolescent boys (Hollywoods favorite demographic) swarm to his films.""The Island"" contains all of Bays trademarks -- a total disregard for the laws of physics over-the-top chase scenes and lots of circular panning shots.But unlike his other films ""The Island"" also has an interesting story penned by Caspian Tredwell-Owen (with script credit also going to Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci) and two very good actors -- Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson -- playing the leading characters.This is the first Michael Bay film Ive actually enjoyed. But thats not saying much.Set in an undetermined near future the first half-hour of the film takes place in a monochromatic futuristic setting where hundreds of people are controlled by a man named Merrick (Sean Bean). Hes told them all that they are survivors of some type of event that has contaminated the entire planet.Occasionally a lottery is held and one lucky person gets to go to ""the island"" a tropical paradise which is supposedly the only safe place left on earth. Everyones goal is to get there.McGregor plays a character named Lincoln Six-Echo who has befriended Jordan Two-Delta played by Johansson. When Jordan is picked to go to the island Lincoln suddenly discovers that their entire existence is a hoax.Big gunsYes he Jordan and nearly everyone around them are clones which are made by Merricks company for people in ""the real world."" Basically theyre being used as spare parts for extremely wealthy people. When theyre called to the island theyre really being sliced and diced like a stolen car in a chop shop. Steve Buscemi plays a man who befriends McGregors character. With the help from McCord a human working at the facility (played by the always good Steve Buscemi) Lincoln and Jordan make a death-defying (is there any other kind in a movie like this?) escape into the real world and Bay brings out his big guns.From this point on its pure Bay -- action action action. At one point Jordan survives a 70-story fall without a scratch. Thats a lot of disbelief to suspend.However the story still has some surprises left and Johansson and McGregor have good romantic chemistry. Theyre both such good actors they somehow make the unbelievable in ""The Island"" believable -- to an extent anyway.""The Island"" isnt the best sci-fi thriller out there this summer -- ""War of the Worlds"" wins by miles -- but its enjoyable. You just have to take all of Bays excess with a grain ... oh lets make that a pound of salt. After all he doesnt really make movies he makes roller coaster rides. So if youre in the mood ""The Island"" is just worth the trip.

Browse over 8 million products  Clothing amp; Jewelry  Computers amp; Electronics  Home amp; Garden  Kids amp; Family Island no refuge from pandemoniumBy Claudia Puig USA TODAY The overwrought sci-fi action thriller The Island could be renamed Revenge of the Clones. Despite being talented and handsome leads Scarlett Johansson and Ewan McGregor lack chemistry in The Island. Warner Bros. This frenzied fiesta of firepower is about cloning people for spare parts but the movie is a clone itself. Possessing no new ideas it reworks and borrows from such films as Blade Runner The Matrix and Logans Run. Director Michael Bay may be taking his revenge on those who have derided his previous testosterone-fueled films Armageddon Pearl Harbor and Bad Boys. If just the titles of his previous movies fill you with dread The Island is not your preferred destination. The presence of the talented and handsome leads Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson doesnt add much to this loud sometimes frenetic cinematic assault. Disappointingly they lack chemistry. The notion that someday the rich and well-connected can stave off disease and old age with cloned body parts is an intriguing premise. But it gets lost in the mayhem. (Related video Watch the Island trailer) About the movie The Island   (out of four) Stars Ewan McGregor Scarlett Johansson Djimon Hounsou Sean Bean Steve Buscemi Michael Clarke Duncan Director Michael Bay Distributor DreamWorks Running time 2 hours 7 minutes Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action some sexuality and language Opens Friday nationwide Set in the mid-21st century The Island opens in a sterile facility housing a community of clones who have been told they are the sole human survivors of a massive ecological disaster. They are controlled like schoolchildren with vapid admonitions such as ""a healthy body is a happy body"" amplified over loudspeakers. Their every move is monitored. If members of the opposite sex stand too close to each other they will be cited for a proximity violation. They eagerly await a daily contest in which someone is selected to live outside the community on a lush verdant island the only uncontaminated spot left in the world. Or so they believe. McGregor who plays an unusually curious clone starts questioning his surroundings and finds out the nasty truth the specifics of which we wont reveal. He and best pal Johansson break out of the facility. There is some comedy to be had in their cluelessness about the real world. And there is plenty of calamity. They destroy much of downtown Los Angeles as they run from police and a powerful security official (Djimon Hounsou) in an armored Humvee. A spectacular scene in which his Hummer is blown up will delight those who oppose the gas-guzzling behemoths. The fleeing renegades wreak havoc despite the mantra with which they were indoctrinated Be pleasant and peaceful. And although the facilitys officials have removed the sex drive from all the clones there is a hint of romance between the pair once they hit L.A. Despite all the firepower the movie is only sporadically exciting. There is a lot of downtime in which to question the logic of the story. If you enjoy watching things blow up seeing attractive people imperiled and watching protracted chase sequences The Island might make a decent summer getaway. But when it comes to real intrigue there are much better summer escapes.

"Island Trouble in Paradise washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Island Trouble in Paradise Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 22 2005 THE BEST THING about ""The Island"" is this Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson buffed and dressed in sparkling white wondering how and when to kiss each other. Go ahead Ewan mate. Plant a juicy one on those pink upholstered chops. Hit that sensual airbag with everything youve got. Do it for Scotland lad. Do it for mankind. And you Miss Scarlett with all those ts and ss in your bonnie names. Enjoy the moment. Close your eyes Girl With a Pearl. Thats Obi-Wan McNobi youre puckering up for. Their hesitation to kiss you see comes from the fact theyre playing harvested beings or replicants -- to borrow a term from ""Blade Runner"" which Michael Bays movie has ransacked like WorldComs Bernard Ebbers. McGregor is a cloned human called Lincoln Six Echo and Johansson named Jordan Two Delta is also a copy of someone else. This is deep in the 21st century and theyre part of a colony housed in a massive facility overseen by -- who else? -- an Englishman by the name of Merrick (Sean Bean). Everyone is dressed in white and made to live in a state of comfortable incarceration because they are told the post-apocalyptic world outside is contaminated. Everyone is waiting for their big day when he or she is selected to live on the Island. This resort supposedly is the only place on Earth where you can live outside. A lottery randomly selects candidates daily. Nobody realizes they are clones but Lincoln is starting to question things. This is troublesome to the authorities who watch their charges on monitors and look for any signs of well inconvenient humanity. The residents are also discouraged from engaging in ""close proximity"" which is futurespeak for displaying more than passing friendliness. So when Lincoln Six Echo and Jordan Two Delta develop certain feelings for each other theyre confused. (They are the mental equivalent of 15-year-olds but with each discovery theyre maturing at a rapid rate.) When Jordan is selected for the Island Lincoln knows hell never see her again. A little investigation proves him right and before you can say ""Logans Run"" theyre on the lam. Cue the helicopters and a paramilitary troubleshooter named Albert Laurent (Djimon Hounsou) to chase them. Lincoln and Jordans mission to find the real humans they were copied from and to alert outside society about this nefarious lab from whence they were sprung. As pretty very human stars McGregor and Johansson put the main sizzle into ""The Island"" since weve seen this plotline and this Brave New World in better sci-fi films. Thanks to their performances its still fun to watch. (If only filmmaker Bay whose over-the-top resume includes ""The Rock"" ""Armageddon"" ""Bad Boys II"" and ""Pearl Harbor"" could have cut 30 minutes out of this thing it would be even more enjoyable.) And lets give a round of applause for Bays casting of Steve Buscemi as McCord a rumpled techie from the facility who helps Lincoln and Jordan escape. His personality a sort of what-the-heck (to term it politely) approach to life injects the sci-fi seriousness with offbeat humor. A secondhand story like this one needs every shot of fun it can get.

In the not-too-distant future an unspecified ecological disaster has killed off most of Earths population and made the planets surface all but unlivable. A few hundred survivors have been transported to a state-of-the art fallout shelter where everyone dresses alike sexual impulses are reduced to sub-Star Wars levels and a pleasing disembodied female voice instructs ""Be polite pleasant and peaceful. A healthy person is a happy person."" No this isnt a documentary about the Church of Scientology Celebrity Center -- its Michael Bays The Island a topical mix of science fact and science fiction whose title refers to the worlds last sliver of habitable land passage to which is regulated by a supposedly random lottery. Only in The Island nothing is quite as it appears. The memories you think are your own really arent. The coveted Shangri-la is like so many promised lands before it (both in real life and the movies) nothing more than a promise. And as for that lottery -- well lets just say that when your numbers up it really is up. None of which will come as much of a surprise to the seasoned genre enthusiast who will immediately detect in Bays film the lipstick traces of 1984 Blade Runner Gattacaany number of old Star Trek episodesand in particular Logans Run with its unflattering unisex costumes and quest for a panacea known as Sanctuary. But in Logans Run you were at least allowed to live to see 30 whereas the ""survivors"" of The Island are offered no such guarantees. The thing theyve survived you see isnt global apocalypse but an accelerated cloning process designed to manufacture human ""insurance policies"" for wealthy ""sponsors."" (So perhaps it only makes sense that the movie itself is a clone.) Got a bad ticker? A terminal illness? Or merely concerned about not growing old gracefully? Just plunk a few million down and let the innovators at Merrick Biotech create a new you that can be harvested for spare parts when the need arises. And so it goes until one subversive apple threatens to spoil the whole bunch -- a clone called Lincoln Six-Echo (Ewan McGregor) who despite his petri-dish pedigree possesses an ample helping of old-fashioned human curiosity. (Ample enough for him to stick his nose where it doesnt belong at any rate but not to ask where babies come from or why his name sounds like a telephone exchange.) Nary an original idea abounds in The Island though the movie does entertain a litany of thorny moral quandaries that seem well-timed to the ongoing debates over stem-cell research and the direction of the Supreme Court. Not that Bay or his trio of screenwriters (Caspian Tredwell-Owen Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci) dig very deep beneath those ideas hot-button surfaces. The Island is the sort of picture that generates lots of pseudo think-pieces in the major newspapers and magazines but doesnt give you half as much pause to consider mankinds future as say War of the Worlds. The only people whove endeavored to buy Merricks insurance policies are ones were supposed to spite anyway -- vain and/or idly rich supermodels celebrity footballers Presidents of the United States -- and not for a single moment does the movie dare to suggest how quickly if eternal (or at least extended) life really were an opportunity you and I might seize it.Which may be just as well. Though this is the first of Bays films to be made away from the Jerry Bruckheimer fold aside from a few superficial details (not every image is tinted the same shade of supersaturated orange) its by and large the kind of picture hes always made -- a loud steroidal adrenaline-pumper in which Bay proves yet again that when it comes to smashing crashing and blowing things up real good he has few equals. His onscreen destructiveness isnt pretty or poetic but it does carry a special exuberance like the pleasure a child takes in destroying his own toys. And there are several set pieces here as Lincoln and the beautiful Jordan Two-Delta (Scarlett Johansson) flee from their nefarious captors that equal or exceed the high standard for action-movie auto-erotica set by Bays previous film Bad Boys 2. Who other than Bay would have come up with the high-speed freeway chase in which Lincoln and Jordan lob what look like giant iron dumbbells at their pursuers (and anyone else who happens to get in the way) from the back of a speeding flatbed truck? And who else would have had so much fun doing it?Humanism on the other hand doesnt suit Bay at all (see Pearl Harbor) and when The Island strives for seriousness -- particularly in the opening and closing sequences set within the survivors bunker -- its dead in the water. Bay seems bored with these scenes and the feeling is contagious but in truth the deck may be stacked against him from the start. The peculiar genius of the Matrix movies (at least of the first one) was how effectively they made us accept that petrified pearl of science-fiction wisdom that says mans yen for nonconformity will ultimately trump all efforts to suppress it. The Island goes one step further explaining that back before its clones were brought into a fully cognitive state their organs did not long survive the transplantation process. Somehow without real life experience they simply werent ""human"" enough. But quite frankly such notions seem less science fiction than out-and-out science fantasy in a world where the blue pill is so widely preferred to the red. We buy our Nikes no matter the human flesh that is expended in their manufacture; we drive our SUVs no matter the environmental consequences; we patronize Starbucks and Barnes amp; Noble at the expense of independent merchants. And we queue up in droves to see movies like The Island. THE ISLAND | Directed by MICHAEL BAY | Written by CASPIAN TREDWELL-OWEN ALEX KURTZMAN and ROBERTO ORCI | Produced by WALTER F.

That way if something unfortunate happens to Mr. or Ms. Moneybags -- a defective liver a bum ticker -- he or she will be able to harvest whats needed from the made-to-order backup and discard the rest. This is of course a terrible thing to do to an innocent agnate -- who is a human being after all no matter how unromantic the biological conception or how oblivious the specimen to his or her purpose and fate on earth. Hath not a clone eyes? If you prick him doth he not bleed through his sleek white Logans Run jumpsuit? But all is not so forlorn in the near-futuristic scenario governed by director Michael Bay. While scientists are raising replicants in the images of humans as comely as Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson (its a little joke that she plays a clone of a model har) and indoctrinating them with the myth that they are the very special sole survivors of a fatally contaminated universe happy non-agnate children in the outside world still enjoy BEN amp; JERRYS ice cream. Efficient non-agnate adults can take advantage of the latest technological breakthroughs from MICROSOFT and NOKIA. And best of all at least for lovers of stuff that blows up and kills people theres piles of it going boom in SONY DIGITAL DYNAMIC SOUND (in selected theaters). Are there really lovers of stuff that blows up and kills people anymore? Which is to say are there any who actively look forward to a Michael Bay movie in which vehicles race each other into oblivion humans fight one another to death destruction is wholesale and no camera shot is held for more than three seconds? Are there moviegoers who are so satisfied with the stringing together of special-effects explosions (including of course the composite shot of a body hurled through fiery space) that they think ""Dang thats what I call entertainment""? Or are we all just...lab rats conditioned to think that this is what a big American action picture looks like? Maybe were the agnates and Bay occupies the role played by Sean Bean that of a nefarious genius of biogenetic engineering who has turned human complacency into big business? I digress; time to adjust the serotonin levels. Its agnates Lincoln Six-Echo (McGregor) and Jordan Two-Delta (Johansson) were meant to care about out of all the others in the spandex brigade although screenwriters Caspian Tredwell-Owen Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci sure dont make the empathy easy. Lincolns a feisty one full of beans and a few too many strands of wild-card DNA that are causing flare-ups of disturbing ""memories"" and bad behavior; hes a potential troublemaker and while McGregor is allowed to stir and prowl in the first third of the movie (his discovery of the truth about agnate existence is a tingly moment of horror) hes quickly relegated in the other two-thirds to oafish ejaculations of ""Go"" and ""Run"" and ""Hold on"" Jordan on the other hand is simply a generic lump of cells with which Johansson can do little wise-child eyes and all. When Lincoln urges Jordan to escape Agnateville with him explaining that the contamination-free island holiday theyve been promised is a hoax or when a corporate security detail (headed by an ill-used Djimon Hounsou) comes after the two escapees she responds like a -- well like a model posing for a cosmetics ad. The Island is not without good questions (How far are you willing to go to protect your own good health? What does the phrase ""taking a dump in the can"" suggest to someone who has never heard it before?) and even a few molecules of wit that pass like aberrations. With the appearance of Steve Buscemi for instance as a scraggly antiauthoritarian human worker at the clone house who befriends Lincoln at his peril the script takes an incongruous detour toward playfulness. And Lincolns third-act encounter with his own progenitor is a tasty bit of high-concept fun for McGregor. And then boom And ""Look out"" The Island begins with a whimper of interest as a cool-hued cautionary exploration of the ethics of cloning and ends in a hail of product placement with a dumb bang.

"Island The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; island-the ) Island The (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli If there are lots of flashes and bangs and smoke and fire either your car has just rear-ended a Pinto or Michael Bay has made a new movie. Sometimes both are disasters. In the case of The Island theres enough fun to be had that its almost possible to ignore the stupidity of the story and the cavity that replaces character development. This is a non-interactive video game demo crossed with an amusement park ride. It offers plenty of thrills but nothing else. It looks and sounds good but satisfies only on the most primal level. For some this will be enough. Calling The Island a ""popcorn old-fashioned summer movie"" is fair but its also sad since it could have been more. But movies that aim low rarely achieve any kind of altitude. For Michael Bay this is an opportunity to strike into new territory. This is the first directorial outing in which he has not been partnered with producer Jerry Bruckheimer. It isnt apparent - the movie is just as loud and action-oriented as anything he did with Bruckheimer. In Bays canon The Island ranks second - behind the filmmakers only truly good movie The Rock but ahead of such memorable epics as ArmageddonPearl Harbor and Bad Boys II. The Island like Bay delivers whats expected and not a thing more. And although it engaged me during most of its two-plus hour running length I left the theater feeling a hollow and even a little let down. To the extent that it takes place in a futuristic setting The Island functions as science fiction. Really though the 2090 locales are just excuses to make things look a little more exotic. The central conceit - cloning - turns into a plot device. Despite the richness of the premise which asks a number of bio-ethical questions there is little room for complex moral conundrums once the adrenaline starts pumping. And for a movie that opens in a field of ideas it comes as a disappointment to learn that the conclusion is just a big fight with lots of things blowing up. (Rumor has it that the original script penned by Caspian Tredwell-Owen before Bay became involved and brought in Alex Kurtzman amp; Roberto Orci was more thoughtful and intelligent than the final project. Tredwell-Owen is remaining mum about his opinion of the final product probably because Dreamworks paid him 1 million for the rights.) Ewan McGregor is Lincoln Six Echo an obedient worker in a society whose inhabitants are characterized by their lack of rebelliousness or inquisitiveness. Supposedly Lincoln is a survivor of a great calamity that resulted in the contamination of the Earth. Now he and a few thousand others live in a man-made safe compound eagerly awaiting the chance to win a daily lottery and claim its prize a trip to The Island ""natures last remaining pathogen-free zone."" But Lincoln suspects all is not what it seems to be and hes right. Along with his best friend Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson) he seeks out the truth - and it turns out to be shocking. Soon aided only by a nebbish technician named McCord (Steve Buscemi) they are on the run from the single-minded doctor who runs the compound Merrick (Sean Bean) and his hired ex-military mercenary Laurent (Djimon Hounsou). Its fair to say that Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson are mostly overwhelmed by the fast cuts frantic action and relentless musical score by Steve Jablonsky. Being professionals they take it all in stride and during those rare moments when things quiet down they are granted opportunities to remind us that they can act. Playing second fiddle to the technical aspects of a film is probably old hat for McGregor who is doing his fourth mega-budget motion picture (also his third one to feature clones) but this is all new to Johansson whose forte (at least to-date) has been smaller character-driven films. If nothing else The Island will get her enough exposure that shell be able to capture any role she wants. Steve Buscemi Sean Bean Djimon Hounsou and Michael Duncan Clarke round out a cast thats light on star power but heavy on talent. The Island is reminiscent of Arnold Schwarzeneggers Total Recall which used science fiction ideas as a backdrop for lots of fights chases and other assorted excitement. Overall Recall did a better job at least in the story department. The action is superior in The Island but thats probably to be expected since the bar has been raised considerably since 1989. Others may be reminded of The Matrix and Minority Report but The Island isnt in the same league. Those two movies were the complete package - not only did they follow through on their tantalizing ideas but they offered a near-perfect mix of adrenaline and testosterone. They leave The Island bobbing far in their wake. As disposable entertainment The Island does what it is supposed to do. There are two remarkable car chases (one featuring oversized barbells) flawless interaction between two identical McGregors (one with an American accent the other with his proper one) some really big explosions and enough sequences to make a video game designer smile. Dont expect filet mignon with The Island; this is hamburger. If Martin Scorsese is a fine steak house then Michael Bay is MacDonalds. And watching the movie is akin to eating in that place. Its fast greasy and fills an immediate need but youd better have the Rolaids handy for the indigestion that follows.

DreamWorks and Warner Bros. look to harvest decent if not spectacular opening returns. ""The Island"" is no paradise. In his latest exercise in sensory overkill producer-helmer Michael Bay takes on the weighty moral conundrums of human cloning resolving them in a storm of bullets car chases and more explosions than you can shake a syringe at. Frenetic actioner about refugees from a genetic cloning plant starts off intriguingly burns up its ideas in the first hour and pads out the rest with joltingly repetitive action sequences. Given Bays built-in mostly male audience DreamWorks and Warner Bros. look to harvest decent if not spectacular opening returns though specimens long-term viability is far less assured. Its the year 2019 and Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) is one of several hundred survivors of a cataclysm that left the whole world contaminated save one place -- the eponymous Island. This lush retreat Lincoln and the other refugees are promised will one day be their home. For now theyre kept in a lavish but sterile research facility where authorities force them to wear identifying wrist bracelets; their moods diet and metabolism are carefully monitored; and male-female ""proximity"" is strictly forbidden. Suspicious by nature and prone to prophetic nightmares Lincoln finds his worst fears confirmed after Starkweather (Michael Clarke Duncan) selected by random lottery to go to the Island instead winds up on a slab. When his friend and burgeoning love interest Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson) is the next one to win the lottery Lincoln grabs her and together they stage a jailbreak. Alarmed by the breach sinister mastermind Dr. Merrick (Sean Bean adding another to his gallery of villains) hires a mercenary (Djimon Hounsou) to hunt them down. One of the small charms of ""The Island"" is that its test-tube protags far from being hardened heroes are a pair of brainwashed innocents sealed off from the outside world and generally lacking in social smarts. McGregor exploits this most winningly affecting an earnest gee-whiz streak and speaking his lines in a boyish slightly higher register. Faring not so well is Johansson usually the subtlest of actresses who in her first major action role has been encouraged to make a shrill bombastic spectacle of her characters cluelessness. Another downside of Lincoln and Jordans ignorance is that by the time they realize whats up -- that theyre walking ""insurance policies"" raised only to supply organs for their genetically identical owners -- auds will have long since figured everything out. While the essentially surprise-free narrative plays catch-up theres little to do but sit back and admire Nigel Phelps gleaming production design; the biotech facility in particular suggests a cross between a day spa a spaceship and a maximum-security prison. Yet even here Bays direction zips along at such an unmodulated rush so eager to get on with the next set-piece or expository line of dialogue that auds will have precious little time to soak up the images much less allow their potentially troubling implications to deepen and resonate. Setting and premise conjure countless visual and thematic echoes from other films including ""The Matrix"" with its paranoid dystopian vision and roomful of sticky birth-pods and even ""The Truman Show"" with its 24-hour surveillance cameras and megalomaniacal controller. One scene featuring an army of mechanized eye-scanning spiders is lifted straight out of the more convincingly futuristic ""Minority Report."" The references feel thoroughly secondhand; Bay ultimately is interested in the science and ethics of cloning only insofar as they provide a backdrop for all the vehicular chaos hes set to unleash. (Ancillary moral Clones are human too.) In terms of spectacle pic is a pileup of kinetic mayhem as Lincoln and Jordans first actions in the real world include dodging bullets destroying several police cars and crashing a hovercraft into a skyscraper. Yet for all the vertiginous camera movements and ace visual effects the action remains tension-free and largely incoherent thanks to attention-deficit editing by Paul Rubell and Christian Wagner. Scribes Caspian Tredwell-Owen Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci save their best lines for the superbly snarky Steve Buscemi as a facility staffer who comes to the clones aid (and has a priceless exchange with ""Ghost World"" co-star Johansson in the process). And pic has sly fun with Lincolns and Jordans ""owners""; former is played by McGregor in an effective second role while latter is glimpsed in Johanssons real-life Calvin Klein ad. Other product placements particularly by Aquafina are too numerous to mention. The IslandProductionA DreamWorks release of a DreamWorks and Warner Bros. presentation of a Parkes/MacDonald production.
