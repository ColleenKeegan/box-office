The Theory of Everything is shaping up to be one of them. Director James Marsh takes an unremarkable chronological approach to the life of cosmologist Stephen Hawking. Hawking is a man whose state of being is irony itself - a mind that takes wings through the universe and time while trapped in an atrophied immobile body. Marsh (Man On Wire) makes no overt artistic statements in chronicling Hawkings life from brash athletic young prodigy at Oxford to latter-day Einstein struggling against the confinement and ostensible death sentence of ALS (both lives connected by the love of a good woman Hawkings now ex-wife Jane). But he leaves plenty of room for this years possible Best Actor Oscar performance. As Hawking Eddie Redmayne (Les Miserables) performs with the precision of an athlete - having used a choreographer to help him achieve the exact level of physicality demanded by each stage and infirmity of Hawkings life. At the same time theres a mischievous quality to Redmayne that seems a good match with the wit Hawking has always managed to convey with a raised eyebrow and a mechanically-voiced quip. And humour is not lacking in The Theory of Everything. Anthony McCartens script has a handful of one-liners that sneak up on the audience at key moments. Among them When Jane (Felicity Jones) is at wits end caring for her husband and their children and her mother urges she her to join a church choir. ""That may be the most English thing anybody has ever said to me"" Jane responds (nonetheless she does join the choir fatefully for their relationship). Witticisms like ""Cosmology is religion for atheists"" help paper over The Theory of Everythings reluctance to explain the stuff that makes Hawking important. Just as well. You wont come out of The Theory of Everything with any greater understanding of quantum theory. But you will see a bittersweet romance played out without obvious villains (the source material is an autobiography by the former Jane Hawking who saw her husband leave her for his nurse Elaine Mason played here by Maxine Peake). Some of the characters seem to exist mainly to further the plot notably Mason and Dennis Sciama (David Thewlis) the latter of whom was Hawkings physics professor whose role in the movie is mainly to shake his head and admire his former student as he shakes convention and piles up accolades. But the Hawkings seem movingly real besotted college sweethearts unready for the aftermath of what starts out as bouts of clumsiness and - on her part - blind to the reality of what her defiant devotion will demand. Redmaynes performance as Hawking will call to mind Daniel Day-Lewiss in My Left Foot (and leave cynics suggesting that it is a ""physically-challenged"" role tailor-made for awards). It is in fact a more subtle performance tantrum free and very British in its resolve.

Knightly came up empty ""No"" she responded. ""What is up with that?"" Knightley then lobbed the question back to the reporter ""Go on youre a writer write one. Do it I would love to play a genius."" The newspaper ran a version of that last quote as the articles headline the point being that if Knightley doesnt get asked to play a biopic lead its unlikely other actresses do.The Theory of Everything which continues its theatrical run this weekend does not exactly rise up to meet Knightleys challenge but it does take a step in that general direction. Everything belongs in part to the troubled-male-genius genre and in part to the feel-good disability movie type that tends to feature singularly extraordinary men as well. And its the performance of British up-and-comer Eddie Redmayne as the theoretical physicist-cosmologist thats getting the bulk of the Oscar attention following up his buzzy hearthrob role as Marius in Les Miserables.Related Story Fall Movie Preview 21 Buzzy Awards-Season Contenders But The Theory of Everything also stars Felicity Jones. Ultimately this isnt a biopic about Hawkings or even about his quest to unite the general theory of relativity with quantum mechanics the ""everything"" the title so grandiosely refers to (though that gets a lot of symbolic mileage). Its about his fulfilling and failed first marriage with Jane Wilde (Jones) whom he met as a graduate student at Cambridge and remained married to for 30 years.Contemporary viewers probably know about Stephen Hawking thanks to Stephen Hawking himself. His memoir A Brief History in Time sold more than 10 million copies in 20 years and due to the Intel computer-based system that allows him to communicate orally at 72 years old he still does starry interviews and gives inspiring lectures.But The Theory of Everything adapted from Wildes 2007 memoir Travelling to Infinity My Life With Stephen favors the female perspective. Wilde was initially much more negative about the marriage in her first account of it 1999s Music to Move the Stars A Life with Stephen. The 2007 book was essentially a massive update that uplifted the tone an overall beneficence that is preserved in this movies meet-cute story When the film opens its 1964 and Stephens a graduate student at Cambridge limbs all functioning hormones all raging. At a house party he locks eyes with Jane the arts major (Spanish medieval poetry) to his science the infusion of faith to his atheist theories. She wishes him well with the equation he tells her he wants to solve--the whole combine-relativity-and-quantum thing--and basically its love at first sight.Shes the arts major to his science the infusion of faith to his atheist theories. Stephen quickly dispatches Janes pesky boyfriend seducing Jane with fun facts about UV rays and poetic metaphors about the stars. But after a terrible fall on the Cambridge quad culminates some problems hes been having with shaking limbs Stephen gets a crushing diagnosis He has motor-neuron disease and two years to live. He holes himself up in his room and distances himself from Jane. Its a testament to both director David Marshs light touch and composer Nicklas Schmidts easy-listening score that the existential despair is not drummed up too much.But its also a testament to the close attention the movie pays to Jane who drives Stephen out of his solitude coaxes him into marriage because she has faith he will survive and nurses him through his physical decline just as shes having children and tending to them too. Her decision seems a tad naive but at the same time fierce. In an early scene Stephens father tells her his illness wont be a battle it will be a ""huge defeat."" Years later with Stephen still alive marriage on the rocks Janes the one fighting the fight and making the executive decisions to keep him that way. Stephen the movie shows isnt the only extraordinary one here.The same could be said for Felicity Joness performance which matches Redmaynes uncanny appropriation of Hawkings tics and humor with a more subdued transformation. As plenty of other reviews have mentioned Redmaynes performance crafts a compelling and astonishing facsimile of Hawking. He gives young Stephen many of the characteristics that Hawking becomes known for later in his life in the grips of ALS the twinkly humor the eyeglasses that are always askance the bowed posture the tense limbs. Likeable though he is Redmayne doesnt shy from portraying Hawkings darker self-absorbed side either. If the film unfolds like a fairytale at least its a fairytale that doesnt often get told.But as the years slip by and Redmayne settles first into Hawkings wheelchair then into the cosmologists real trademarked computerized voice Jones slips on the demeanor of an overworked mother. How could she not be with Stephen letting the children run wild? But Jane fatigued as she looks infuses some unexpected life into what otherwise might be some very dull marital drama When her mother innocently suggests she try out for the church choir to take some time for herself Jane ends up meeting the attractive choir-master who will become her second husband.The Theory of Everything is not daring enough to challenge its actors to show the visceral fallout incurred by this--amongst other--emotional infidelities. This is a movie overseen by Wilde and approved by Hawking; its not a probing dark investigation of their psyches. The second acts wordless simmer is about as conflicted as it gets and separation rarely looks so serene (or educational) for both parties.The surface of the movie is also glossy with Cambridges Gothic architecture precious cinematic techniques and Jones in authentic 70s bowtie blouses. But its hard to begrudge the cutesy ending sequence just like its hard to resist the way the film brings out the children for sentimental effect and features visual motifs inspired by Stephens theory about black holes. Thats because in spite of all the period-piece pleasures Marsh spends the most time on tight back-and-forth shots of his actors faces. All the better to let Jones and Redmayne share the spotlight.The Theory of Everything is remarkably loyal to Jane for an Oscars-bound pic about one of the greatest scientists of our era. If the film unfolds like a fairytale at least its a fairytale that doesnt often get told. That is to say one that reappropriates the dominant fantasy of the singular historic male genius to honor the experience--at once exhausting and exhilarating--of the woman who dared to sign on to be Mrs. Stephen Hawking.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

After Khizr Khan spoke politicians and commentators on most networks said they were moved humbled inspired choked up.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

Liam Daniel/Focus Features hide caption toggle caption Liam Daniel/Focus Features Eddie Redmayne plays astrophysicist Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything. Liam Daniel/Focus Features British science is having a cinematic moment with The Theory of Everything now and The Imitation Game soon. Yet neither film has much science in it. These accounts of Stephen Hawking and Alan Turing respectively are engaging and well-crafted but modeled all too faithfully on old-school romantic dramas. In the movie universe scientific breakthroughs -- even when they help defeat the Nazis as Turings did -- must be less important than love. Which come to think of it is also the corn-belt communique beamed back from Interstellar a film that relies on the cosmological savvy of Kip Thorne one of Hawkings closest colleagues. Thorne appears briefly in The Theory of Everything which introduces several of Hawkings scientific peers but focuses on a single companion the one who wrote the book from which co-producer Anthony McCartens script is derived. Shes Jane Hawking nee Wilde as embodied by the ideally named Felicity Jones. Pretty and vivacious yet not so delicate as she appears Jane is irresistible to the young Stephen (Eddie Redmayne) when he spots her at a party. This is one of many incidents depicted in the film that didnt exactly happen. Every time an everyday event can be transformed into a movie moment McCarten and director James Marsh (Man on Wire) go for it. In broad outline the story they tell is true. Hawking a brilliant Ph.D. candidate at Cambridge is distracted and disorganized but becomes studiously focused on Jane. Hes diagnosed with a motor neuron disease related to ALS soon after they meet but she marries him anyway. Soon she has three young children and a husband whose body is withering. The couple struggles medically and financially but he retains his intellect and wit and she her radiance and good humor. She even learns enough of his work to illustrate the conflict between quantum mechanics and the general theory of relativity -- using peas and potatoes -- to Jonathan (Charlie Cox) a choirmaster who becomes an intimate family friend. Stephen wins fame as the author of A Brief History of Time although the equation that will unify all astrophysics remains elusive. (Marsh embodies the universe in a swirling cup quoting not Einstein but Godards Two or Three Things I Know About Her.) Then pneumonia -- whose operatic onset is another fictionalized episode -- leads to a tracheotomy and further loss of ability to communicate. Ultimately Jane becomes very close to Jonathan while Stephen does the same with a therapist (Maxine Peake). And so a 25-year marriage ends a rupture that may have been a little stormier in actuality than in this sanitized telling. Although it probably is hard to get into a shouting match with a husband who speaks through a voice synthesizer. Devolving from a man who seems a bit clumsy to one who can barely move at all Redmayne gives an impressive physical performance. It recalls Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot -- minus the rage. Theres little acrimony in The Theory of Everything which may reflect Hawkings actual outlook or just the movies puppyish desire to please. As gentle and saintly as Jennifer Connellys character in A Beautiful Mind Jones Jane is immensely appealing if a bit unbelievable. And since in movies the essence of female virtue is cuteness Jane barely ages over three decades. Perhaps she took a rejuvenating whirl through the wayback machine that in one of the clunkier touches rewinds the story at the movies end. Certainly it feels as if the script did yielding the time anomaly of a 2014 film that seems to have been written when its 72-year-old protagonist was still in short pants. Jennifer Connelly Nov. 10 2014 An earlier version of this review was mistaken as to the spelling of Jennifer Connellys name and the title of A Beautiful Mind.

But the way he fuses past and future makes this a triumph of sympathetic imagination. 287 Shares Share 260 Tweet 25 Share 1 Share Email Print Share Photo Liam Daniel/Focus Features Neuroscience is still a ways away from drawing connections (if they exist) between certain forms of genius and the physical or psychological maladies that attend them but biopics routinely hint at the continuum -- and its there from the start in Eddie Redmaynes astonishing performance as Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything. Well before Hawkings amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (a.k.a. Lou Gehrigs disease) manifests itself Redmaynes Hawking seems disconnected from his clumsy gangling body -- already a poor vessel for his restless brain. He shoves a hand into a pocket as if he cant quite place its function. He doesnt speak he blurts. Most of us come into the film having only seen the twisted wheelchair-bound Hawking and heard his computer-generated voice so were primed to look for signs of whats to come. Theres no doubt that Redmayne is working from 20/20 hindsight. But the way he fuses past and future makes this a triumph of sympathetic imagination. If The Theory of Everything cut as deeply as Redmaynes performance it might be on the level of My Left Foot. But there are so damn many problems easy to ignore at first in the elation of watching Redmayne and the gossamer Felicity Jones as his future wife Jane but impossible to shake off in the last third. The movie is largely based on a memoir by Jane Traveling to Infinity My Life With Stephen which is to put it starkly a work of finite imagination The lack of insight or evocative detail makes it difficult not to skim. The director James Marsh (of the superb documentaries Man on Wire and Project Nim) and screenwriter Anthony McCarten compensate by creating a meltingly sweet romance in the early scenes building to Janes declaration to Hawkings father (Simon McBurney) that no matter the dire prognosis she and her love will fight the disease together. Bravo Jane But on the basis of her book and the portrait in the film shes not an extraordinary enough figure on which to hang a biography of one of the most titanic scientific minds of the 20th century. For a long while Felicity Jones conjures up much out of nothing. I admit that I find her prettiness nearly overwhelming but physical beauty is a given in most leading actresses and what makes Jones distinctive is her gift for finding her characters unique rhythms. She makes Janes attraction to Hawking at Cambridge infectious -- its as if her (and our) life has suddenly snapped into focus. Much later when her husbands inability to help her herd children or keep house or make time for her own work Jones suddenly seems too large for that small house and appointed role. But then Jane meets a kindly single choirmaster and is almost immediately smitten and as the films focus drifts to her I found myself resenting the character -- not for wanting more from her life but for yanking the narrative away from by far the more fascinating figure. The Theory of Everything holds you by how it dramatizes Hawkings gradual physical disintegration -- the twisting inward of his limbs the more and more incomprehensible speech. Marsh isolates Hawking in the frame as the 1-to-1 correspondence between thought and gesture is disrupted. The greatest actors know to play against their characters disabilities so that what you see is the effort to move or talk ""normally."" (I respect that some find that term demeaning.) You can feel that pushback in Redmaynes movements along with Hawkings sudden brutal awareness of the body hed once ignored. Theres enough science in The Theory of Everything to make you understand the significance of Hawkings idea that quantum physics and relativity ""dont play by the same rules."" Its fun to see some of the English fuddy-duddys storm out of Hawkings presentation while others look on stunned and a Soviet scientist delivers the ultimate judgment ""Our friend has proven time has a beginning. The little one has done it"" But theres little preparation for the Hawking of the later scenes who turns cold and cutting towards Jane and falls for a transparently star-fucking nurse. The films nadir comes when Jane crawls into a tent on a camping trip with her choirmaster while Hawking has an almost-fatal seizure watching a Wagner opera Are we meant to think her far-away infidelity caused his near-death? Thats some space-time continuum. Director Marsh is a gifted documentarian but at this point his dramatic technique is too shallow to get inside his characters heads. The last scenes of the film are frankly lousy -- and when the movie is called The Theory of Everything you really want it to jell.

(AP Photo/Focus Features Liam Daniel) In a weekend of science-fantasy this story of Stephen Hawking and his wife Jane is true science with a complicated heart At the movies this is Science Friday. Christopher Nolans Interstellar and the Disney animated feature Big Hero 6 will battle for weekend box-office domination with tales about scientists of the near future trying to save the Earth by flying into wormholes and other astral phenomena. But those films are the merest or coolest fantasies. In limited release is The Theory of Everything describing the extraordinary life cosmological breakthroughs and complicated marriage of Stephen Hawking. The real Hawking is a ghostly presence in the Black Hole space chase of Interstellar whose science advisor and executive producer Kip Thorne is a longtime Hawking colleague. And the kids in Big Hero 6 are all students at San Fransokyo Institute of Technology a nod to Caltech where Thorne taught and Hawking was a visiting professor. The Theory of Everything is not science fiction; it really has very little science since few viewers would sit as still as Hawking for a lecture on relativity and quantum mechanics. Instead its a domestic drama that uses Hawkings peculiar fame to provide a thoughtful plangent example of the Oscar Wannabe genre. To compete successfully for major Academy Awards a movie should be a true-life portrait of an exceptional man -- sorry ladies -- who struggles against impossible odds in a noble quest. Its a narrow genre that studios ignore the rest of the year in pursuit of fantasy-film box-office billions but it often pays off in statuettes for Best Picture (A Beautiful Mind The Kings Speech Argo 12 Years a Slave) and Best Actor (Sean Penn for Milk Colin Firth for The Kings Speech Daniel Day-Lewis for Lincoln Matthew McConaughey for Dallas Buyers Club). This month just under the wire for the critics-groups prizes the Great Man Theory flourishes in two bio-pics about brilliant Cambridge mathematicians with phenomenal achievements despite physical or social impediments. In The Imitation Game Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) helps win World War II by breaking Germanys Enigma code but suffers because he is gay at a time when homosexual acts were illegal in Britain. That film opens Nov. 28 and will earn awards galore for Cumberbatchs exceptional performance. For now heres The Theory of Everything. Struck by motor neuron disease at 23 and given just two years to live Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) has survived and thrived for another half century due in large part to the loving care of his wife Jane (Felicity Jones). Directed by James Marsh and written by Anthony McCarten from Janes 2007 memoir the film both adheres to and gently upends the conventions of the Great Man genre. For a movie about the author of A Brief History of Time this is a studiously chronological retelling of Stephen and Janes 30-year marriage. Theory finds its saving nuances in the story of a vigorous young man whose disease turns him into his wifes invalid child. Bodily degeneration is one scientific fact Stephen ignores with a mulish cheerfulness even as he takes for granted Janes delaying of her own scholarly goals in order to tend and fend for him. He can grasp the complexities of the cosmos more easily than he can Janes need for upright male friendship with her choirmaster Jonathan Hellyer Jones (Charlie Cox). And as Stephens view of the universe evolves so does his take on the immutability of marriage. A pretty nurse (Maxine Peake) can have that effect on a theory. Memoirs by ex-spouses tend to play up the grievance factor; they are often a settling of scores -- the other party might have gotten the house but the writer controls the story. Jane Hawkings story might be boiled down to this ""I gave up my career to help my husband through his illness for decades. Then he left me for his nurse."" (He married Elaine; Jane married Jonathan.) Jane who was studying medieval Spanish poetry when she met Stephen at Oxford did eventually get her Ph.D. without being able to make productive use of her degree. ""It hasnt led to a career of course"" she told The Guardian in 2004 ""although I have done some sixth form teaching and some university teaching and in a sense the frustration is greater now than it ever was because I feel I have had a great deal to offer but I have nowhere now to go."" Given all this the movie is almost spectacularly even-handed. Renouncing the principles of melodrama it describes a joining of and then a conflict between Good and Good. Before their marriage when his disease has begun to debilitate Stephen Jane avers ""Were going to fight this illness together. All of us."" Their arguments are more likely to be over able agnosticism (his) vs. Christian belief (hers) than on the heroic drudgery they both endure. If there is naivety its Stephens. When he says ""Were just a normal family"" she needs to correct him ""Were not a normal family."" Shes right they were an extraordinary family. Marsh who won an Oscar for his documentary Man on Wire overdoes the visual fireworks. To prepare viewers for the horror of his subjects immobility he shows Stephen bicycle-riding playing pinball serving as cox on the university rowing team. The camera is every bit as acrobatic it whirls indulges in extreme soft-focus distorts Stephens vision through a wide-angle lens. By insisting that his movie will move dammit Marsh gives the impression of not trusting his material. Yet hes attentive to the telling domestic details that suggest the Hawkings were a real plausible couple. And he lets his actors breathe inside their characters. Redmayne himself a Cambridge grad transcends the eerie physical impersonation; he splendidly reveals both Stephens grand resolve and his peculiar blind spots. But this is finally Janes story and The Theory of Everything gives Jones (an Oxford grad) the chance to take control of its emotional center. She seizes it with spectacular subtlety and helps make Jane the most fully realized human character in any of this weekends Science Project movies. Jones proves that behind this Great Man movie is a woman -- an actress -- whos every bit her mans equal. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS JOCELYN NOVECK The famed British physicist Stephen Hawking has never had small ideas or small ambitions least of all his audacious youthful quest to find a ""theory of everything"" -- one that would explain the entire universe in one simple equation. He may not have found exactly that but what Hawking has accomplished we learn anew in James Marshs ""The Theory of Everything"" featuring a superb Eddie Redmayne is staggering. Diagnosed with motor neuron disease at 21 Hawking was given two years to live. A half century later he remains very much alive at 72 and he and his ideas are known around the world; his ""A Brief History of Time"" has sold more than 10 million copies. Its a daunting task to capture such a remarkable life in one movie and ""The Theory of Everything"" doesnt totally escape the typical biopic trap of covering so much time that no one idea is explored deeply enough. Add to that the pressure of having a subject as well-known as Hawking. On top of it all there are the physical challenges of portraying his progressive disability while also channeling the bold complex and often impish spirit underneath. All this makes the performance of the youthful freckled Redmayne at 32 playing his first lead in a movie so exciting and reminiscent of another British actors memorable performance at the same age -- Daniel Day-Lewis in ""My Left Foot."" We begin at Cambridge in 1963 with Stephen a young graduate student in cosmology exuberantly racing his bike around town goofy and gangly with huge black glasses and an oversized grin to match. At a party he spies the winsome Jane (Felicity Jones thoughtful and touching here) and sets about pursuing her. Love blooms and lifes possibilities appear as boundless as the universe -- whether or not it has boundaries is a key question here -- until Stephen starts experiencing marked clumsiness. After a bad fall hes diagnosed with ALS which will result in gradual muscular degeneration. ""What about the brain?"" he asks. ""Youll have the same thoughts"" comes the reply ""only eventually no one will know what they are."" Stephen falls into a deep depression saved only by Janes stubborn love. Thus begins a marriage that will last a quarter-century produce three children and test Janes physical and emotional endurance to the limits (the film is based on Jane Hawkings second memoir adapted by screenwriter Anthony McCarten.) It will also survive Hawkings near-death from pneumonia. A tracheotomy saves his life but deprives him of the ability to speak leading to his famous computer-generated voice. Redmayne relying on less and less of his body succeeds in expressing more and more -- with his eyebrows his eyes and that broad smile showing what a humorous man Hawking can be. Hes heartbreaking though in the scene where he essentially ends his marriage informing Jane that hes asked his perky nurse Elaine Mason (Maxine Peake) to travel to America with him. Elaine will become Hawkings second wife. Jane meanwhile will marry a family friend to whom shes grown close over the years. The various relationships feel somewhat airbrushed -- perhaps not surprising given that the film is based on one persons memoir. What shines through loud and clear though is the humanity in Hawkings incredible story. ""However bad life may seem where there is life there is hope"" the physicist tells an audience and that line could seem hokey in some circumstances but not here. If anyone gets to say that its Stephen Hawking so eloquently embodied in this film. review""The Theory of Everything"" stars Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones.

The movie takes no risks with the material and we never learn how Hawking truly feels about his disease. As a result the film never really gets under your skin. A much better film about a man trapped in his own body is ""The Diving Bell and Butterfly"". Ive seen that one twice and its pulverizing. Bianca Corrinesaid on Sunday November 30 2014 100947 PMI agree with everything you said. Though the performances were great there was nothing that stood out about the film itself. I did enjoy learning about Stephen Hawking but it was all so vanilla that I wouldnt recommend someone rush out to see it. A Beautiful Mind which is another biopic about a scientist who has to deal with an illness at least allowed for some decent action during the hallucination scenes. Im not saying that The Theory of Everything needed action but beautiful imagery and a more focused realistic narrative about his scientific theories would have boosted the movies intrigue for me.

The movie is nowhere near as mawkish as it might have been and Eddie Redmaynes physically wrenching portrayal of Stephen is beautifully balanced by the subtle strength of Felicity Jones Jane.Some of the material here is well known; some is downright surprising. An assumed healthy and clearly brilliant Stephen meets the sparkling young Jane at a party while theyre both in college and he begins pursuing her. Love is in the air.But then Stephen is on the ground having inexplicably fallen at school. A trip to the doctor ends in a diagnosis of ALS and Stephen is given less than two years to live.He and Jane marry anyway and even begin building a brood of kids (some parts of Stephen work just fine). He does not die although he does wither away physically as Jane becomes his full-time caregiver as well as a mother.When shes at her wits end she meets a local minister (Charlie Cox) who she falls in love with and who befriends Stephen as well. Things get complicated. Meanwhile of course Stephen becomes recognized as a brilliant physicist even as his condition continues to deteriorate.Redmayne starts out brimming with awkward charm and retains that spark even as his character slowly collapses.

Photo Credit Focus Features advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The story of renowned physicist Stephen Hawking and his wife Jane Wilde. Rated PG-13. BOTTOM LINE Two Oscar-worthy performances grace this sensitive and delicately crafted biopic. CAST Eddie Redmayne Felicity Jones LENGTH 203 Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones play Stephen Hawking and his wife Jane Wilde in ""The Theory of Everything"" and you couldnt hope to spend time with two fresher more fetching faces. We meet Hawking and Wilde as Cambridge students flush with youth and promise in the early 1960s. The actors even look rather alike with toothy smiles and nearly matching hazel eyes giving us a sense that these two were destined for each other. They were but their story is not made entirely of stardust. Hawking at 21 was diagnosed with the motor neuron disease that would steadily rob him of nearly all voluntary movement. A doctor gives him two years to live and predicts ""Your thoughts wont be affected -- its just that eventually no one will know what they are."" Wilde married him anyhow. advertisement | advertise on newsday Hawking defied that doctor of course Hes still alive and world-renowned thanks to his 1988 book of laymans cosmology ""A Brief History of Time."" Today Hawkings wheelchair and computer-enabled voice are as iconic as Einsteins mustache and live-wire hair. (A Hawking send-up even appears in ""Dumb and Dumber To."") Less familiar is the story of Jane whose 2007 memoir is the basis for this movie. Although ""The Theory of Everything"" touches on Hawkings complex theories of time and space what drives the film is his slow deterioration and Janes struggle to care for him and their children. This is rich material for the films lead actors and both are superb. Although Redmayne eventually uses only his eyes we recognize his every emotion joy regret even arousal. Jones as a wife whose honeymoon period was over before it began never strikes a false note. Its a testament to this films sensitivity and intelligence that its story while somewhat formulaic never feels accusatory or dreary. (Anthony McCarten wrote the script; the director is James Marsh of the Oscar-winning documentary ""Man on Wire."") Everyone here feels real and sympathetic even two characters that represent temptation a handsome widower (Charlie Cox) and a saucy caretaker (Maxine Peake). Its that human-scale notion of relativity that makes ""The Theory of Everything"" work so well.

A black hole as physicist Stephen Hawking tells us is not a hole at all but rather a collapsing mass of concentrated energy that attracts everything around it including light. The metaphor of a shrinking star could describe Hawking too who is confined to a wheelchair and cannot talk but continues to embody cosmic consciousness.In the compelling biography ""The Theory of Everything"" Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) is a brilliant student at Cambridge University when he is caught between competing forces -- the dark diagnosis of motor neuron disease (often called ALS or Lou Gehrigs disease) and the bright light of love (the fine Felicity Jones as literature student Jane).Doctors tell Hawking he might only live for another year but the supernaturally supportive Jane is willing to stand by his side. The film is based on Janes memoir of her decades with Stephen when they raised three children and her husband became the most famous physicist since Albert Einstein.Like ""A Beautiful Mind"" ""The Theory of Everything"" is less concerned with its protagonists ideas than his infirmities. Although most of the movie takes place in academia we dont learn enough about the Big Bang or relativity to ace an astronomy exam but we do get an honors-level lesson in acting.Redmayne (""My Week With Marilyn"") parses every stage of Hawkings challenge from the initial clumsiness to the slurred speech to the crabbed confinement behind an eye-controlled text-to-speech generator. Comparisons to ""My Left Foot"" are inevitable and Oscar voters may not be able to resist Redmaynes stellar performance. But sScreenwriter Anthony McCarten and director James Marsh ensure that this is not manipulative disability porn. The early courtship scenes have a giddy rhythm thats reflected in the imagery a spiral staircase swirled coffee a carousel. And even when Hawking can no longer move or communicate without mechanical assistance there are flashes of humor.Some of the levity is provided by Hawkings nurse Elaine (Maxine Peake) an earthy redhead who is a temperamental contrast to the ethereal Jane. In real life Hawking became romantically involved with Elaine who may have abused him and Jane married widowed choir director Jonathan (played here by Charlie Cox). Theres little room on the movies agenda for the Hawkings human failures. ""The Theory of Everything"" is a brainy bio that exerts a gravitational pull on the heartstrings.What ""The Theory of Everything""  Three and a half stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 203  Content Some mature thematic elements and suggestive material  Where Plaza Frontenac Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

The Theory of Everything (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Theory of Everything (PG-13) Eddie Redmayne is a marvel as astrophysicist Stephen Hawking in this glossy biopic. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com11/19/2014 Editor rating 3 Eddie Redmayne does something extraordinary in The Theory of Everything. Playing the astrophysicist Stephen Hawking who was diagnosed with a crippling disease at 21 that gradually made him lose control of his muscles Redmayne makes you forget youre watching an actor put himself through punishing contortions. He keeps you focused on the soul of a man trapped inside a malfunctioning body a genius who had so much to offer to the world that he refused to give up long after most of us would have surrendered. This sort of role is catnip for actors who love to have something physical to do while theyre reciting their dialogue. But Redmayne (Les Miserables My Week with Marilyn) approaches the part from the inside out instead of the other way around. The more difficult everyday life becomes for Hawking the more Redmayne uses his eyes and tortured voice to prevent us from falling into a pity trap. Even after Hawking loses his ability to speak Redmayne remains vital and aware Hes able to communicate what the scientist was thinking without being able to rely on normal facial expressions. His performance is a marvel on par with Daniel Day-Lewis in My Left Foot except the difficulty level is even higher here. You forget youre watching a healthy normal actor. Redmayne manages to act even with his feet. The Theory of Everything is based on the 2008 memoir Travelling to Infinity by Jane Hawking (played memorably in the film by an equally expressive Felicity Jones) who married Stephen in 1965 after he was diagnosed and given two years to live. This is the revised second version of Janes memoir which was written after she and Stephen had made peace (the original version published in 1999 was much more scathing and condemning). Director James Marsh (Man on Wire Project Nim) keeps the focus on their marriage which spawned three children instead of on Stephens dense work making the movie accessible to the casual viewer and emphasizing the mans humanity instead of his achievements. Unlike The Diving Bell and the Butterfly which used wondrous imagery to convey the imagination of stroke victim Jean-Dominique Bauby as he wrote a book solely by blinking his left eye to a secretary The Theory of Everything remains grounded in a burnished reality. Here is a movie that can get away with that hoary cliche of two young lovebirds looking up at a spectacular fireworks show and make it mean something Youve seen that shot a million times before but here it feels fresh and exhilarating because Stephen is still healthy and you know their budding romance is about to hit a huge hurdle. Like The Kings Speech or Shakespeare in Love The Theory of Everything sometimes feels a bit too polished and precise leaving no room for ambiguity and always staying easy to digest like elegant pap. When Jane starts spending a lot of time with a family friend played by Harry Lloyd the movie immediately lets us know their relationship is strictly platonic instead of making their bond a little more opaque. The screenplay by Anthony McCarten could have also explored the friction between Stephen an atheist and Jane a devout Catholic in deeper detail. But despite the vague Masterpiece Theater aura of Oscar-bait importance The Theory of Everything leaves a deep mark thanks to Redmayne. His uncanny performance does justice to the real-life Hawking who is now 72 and completely paralyzed but still alive and kicking a real-life miracle in a world that could use more of them.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post First lets get this sensual observation out of the way. There are few mouths more astonishing than those of fast-rising British actors Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones. Its a fact that should serve a love story well. And though ""The Theory of Everything"" tussles with quantum physics and Einsteins theory of relativity it is simultaneously an inspired and stirring romance. The two portray theoretical astrophysicist Stephen Hawking and mate Jane Hawking nee Wilde who meet at Cambridge University in 1963. She is studying art. He is a grad student in cosmology. They meet more sweet than cute at a college mixer; their courtship charms. Director James Marsh and screenwriter Anthony McCarten take their lead for this film from Jane Hawkings 2007 memoir ""Travelling to Infinity My Life with Stephen."" In the midst of the amazing -- big ideas deep love -- the devastating happens. Hawking begins to struggle with routine movement. A fall had someone in a preview screening gasp. It is rending. Hawking is diagnosed with motor neuron disease. MND is often referred to as ALS or Lou Gehrigs Disease. Dramatic illness has caused many a decent spouse to waver yes even flee. But Jane digs in when Hawking is suffering from the news when he is sending friends away. They wed. They have a life together even as his condition worsens. ""The Theory of Everything"" charts the trajectory of a long-term relationship even as it tracks Hawkings shattering theoretical successes. Wrinkles in the relationship happen. Jane meets choirmaster Jonathan Hellyer Jones in the 70s. Charlie Cox plays the sympathetic widower who gently enters Janes life but also that of the Hawking family. Stephen begins leaning on a nurse. Maxine Peake does an appealing job as caretaker Elaine Mason. In fact the cast is expert. David Thewlis portrays Dennis Sciama Hawkings doctoral adviser champion admirer. Emily Watson is Janes mother. A montage near the films end captures the profound physical transformation Redmayne embodies over the course of the film. (Hell be an Oscar nom.) It also stands as a tear-courting visualization of Hawkings and our precious quandary time. It seems November is becoming science month on the big screen. Take advantage of it. Time spent in a multiplex seeing this masterful drama Christopher Nolans masterpiece ""Interstellar even ""Big Hero 6"" -- can be as thought-provoking as it is moving. (Our tutorial continues with more melancholy next month with the opening of ""The Imitation Game"" about mathematician and WWII code- breaker Alan Turing.) Meanwhile ""The Theory of Everything"" offers a compassionate consideration of mind-body tensions. (And yes God figures into the mix in ways amusing and respectful.) At 21 Hawking was given two years to live. More than five decades later he has defied the gravity of that diagnosis and taken us beyond our wildest imaginings. That is a thing of wonder -- scientific and beyond.

Credit Daniel McFadden/Courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics And now a fall movie season recap Gone Girl thrills until the ludicrous ending. Interstellar thrills until the ludicrous ending. And Fury. . . Just. Never. Ends. All we have to do now is watch Katniss lead the rebellion against the Capitol in The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 1 (out November 21) and weve successfully transitioned into holiday shopping and marathon TV airings of Elf. But wait Theres still time to catch a few wonderful cinematic must-sees. These gems dont feature the Girl on Fire but they sure do spark. Us Weeklys film critic Mara Reinstein breaks down the five cant-miss fall movies to see before Katniss hits the big screen. Whiplash Daniel McFadden/Courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics 4 stars (out of 4) (out now in theaters) Movies set in a Juilliard-like music school arent supposed to make your heart race in nervous anticipation. Yet thats exactly why this taut drama is one of the years best. Two Oscar-worthy virtuoso performances lead the way Miles Teller as an indefatigable jazz drummer who pounds the sticks until his fingers bleed and J.K. Simmons as his barbaric instructor. (Youll never think of the latter as the caring dad from Juno ever again.) With every syncopated beat the conductor pushes his star pupil to excellence -- and the brink of madness. Their relationship culminates in a staggering crescendo worthy of a standing ovation. The Theory of Everything Liam Daniel / Focus Features 3 1/2 stars (out of 4) (out now in theaters) You may already know about the mathematician Stephen Hawkings beautiful mind. This stirring biopic focuses on his loving but bittersweet 25-year marriage. Surefire Oscar nominees Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones share terrific chemistry as the couple who try to overcome unshakable odds. Soon before their wedding Stephen is diagnosed with a neurological disease and is given two years to live. As his physical condition deteriorates he still has the amazing mental capacity to devise scientific theories and author 1988s A Brief History of Time. No doubt his life is extraordinarily inspiring -- and yet the drama rarely goes the sappy and sentimental route. (Heavy burdens are placed on his wife on a daily basis). Though the marriage eventual crumbles what a joy to see a relationship thats anything but formulaic. PHOTOS Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones hit the red carpet Birdman Twentieth Century Fox 3 stars (out of 4) (out now in theaters) Twenty years after Michael Keaton last put on his Batman costume the actor gives a fearless nod to his-Caped Crusader career in a brazenly off-kilter comedy. Hes Riggan Thomson a former movie franchise star who tries to Go Serious by staging a dramatic Broadway play. Still despite his most valiant manic efforts -- and this is where Keaton really captivates -- Riggan cant shake his Birdman alter ego. Shot via a handheld camera in what appears to be one singular swooping take the film offers a blistering look at how an industry rat race can decimate a mans self-worth. (Emma Stone is sublime as his judgmental newly rehabbed daughter). As a snarky Hollywood takedown however its message -- art good Blockbusters bad -- is a bit pedestrian. PHOTOS Emma Stones best red carpet moments St. Vincent Atsushi Nishijima/Weinstein 3 stars (out of 4) (out now in theaters) The curmudgeon with at the heart of gold teaches a wide-eyed boy about life The story is more worn out than a pair of bowling shoes. But when Bill Murray is the one doling out the lessons resistance is futile. The actor brings wit and humanity to Vincent a crusty blue-collar Vietnam vet. His stagnancy is upended when a recent divorcee (Melissa McCarthy admirably toned down) and her 12-year-old son Oliver (Jaeden Lieberher) move in next door. She works crazy hours leaving Vince to become the kids babysitter. Soon he takes Oliver on field trips to the horse track the bar -- and aww the nursing home where he cares for his wife. Whats next a colorful Irish priest? A kindly prostitute? Check and check (Theyre played by Chris ODowd and Naomi Watts respectively). Still while the film is stuffed with cliches at least theyre the warm and fuzzy kind. PHOTOS Gilmore Girls cast then and now Laggies BARBARA KINNEY 3 stars (out of 4) (out now in theaters and VOD) How nice to see Keira Knightley out of those stuffy corsets. She leaves her comfort zone in this indie comedy playing a pouty American in the throes of a quarter-life crisis. After her cute boyfriend proposes she seemingly has it all -- yet deep down wants none of it. Her plan Run away bunk with her new teen buddy (Chloe Grace Moretz) and like gossip and stuff. The regression becomes complicated when she starts hooking up with the girls single and lonely dad (Sam Rockwell utterly appealing). The film gets by on its amiable charm though dont expect any arresting developments in Knightleys arrested development.

The Theory of Everything the new drama about Stephen and Jane Hawking takes on similar concepts with a gentle whisper. It nestles into your consciousness with soft lighting and inspiration.Stephen Hawking of course is the author of A Brief History of Time the book that made theoretical physics popular and accessible for the masses. Hes also a triumph-of-the-will story Diagnosed with a motor neuron disease as a doctoral candidate at Cambridge and given two years to live he went on to do his most important work and soldiers on today at the age of 72.Eddie Redmayne conveys Hawkings sly sense of humor and he captures the professors disability with studious professionalism and a refreshing lack of cliche.Gawky but charming the young Hawking falls hard for Jane (Felicity Jones) a romance-languages student who sticks by him after he falls ill and ends up in a wheelchair eventually unable to speak. For much of its first half The Theory of Everything unfolds as a tale of two noble people doing their best in trying circumstances.See Stephen earn his degree. See Stephen and Jane have three children. See science explained with beer spilled on a table cream in a coffee cup and the glowing embers of a fireplace.Were happy for him and for her but a narrative torpor sets in and calcifies. Its hard to imagine anyone strenuously objecting to The Theory of Everything because nothing very challenging transpires in tone or tale.Which doesnt make Theory a mere fairy tale of love triumphant. Based on Jane Hawkings book Travelling to Infinity My Life With Stephen Theory takes care to show how the strains of a serious illness can muddy the waters of a marriage. Jane grows smitten with her widowed church choir director (Charlie Cox). Stephen drifts toward a doting caretaker (Maxine Peake). Tension should mount here but it really doesnt. This is the kind of movie that un-ironically climaxes with a standing ovation that has already been telegraphed for two hours.Next up in this movie season of ""brilliant people explain dense scientific concepts and fight through personal adversity"" The Imitation Game the story of World War II code-cracker Alan Turing. Dont blame it for a title that feels more apt by the week.THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING (B)Directed by James Marsh. PG-13 (some thematic elements and suggestive material). 123 mins.

Focus Features Universal The Theory of Everything      (out of five) Director James Marsh Cast Eddie Redmayne Felicity Jones David Thewlis Rating PG-13 (thematic elements suggestive material) Run time 123 min. By Preston Jonespjonesdfw.comPosted 427pm on Thursday Nov. 13 2014 Thursday Nov. 13 2014 Thursday Nov. 13 2014 By Preston Jones Fort Worth Star-Telegram The origins of the universe prove as mysterious as the intimacy of a marriage in The Theory of Everything.Anchored by a pair of mesmerizing performances from Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones who star as Stephen Hawking and Jane Hawking the film almost functions as a more thoughtful companion piece to the blockbuster Interstellar which also concerns itself with matters of the heart amid the cosmos. Adapted from Jane Hawkings 2008 memoir Travelling to Infinity by screenwriter Anthony McCarten Everything joins Hawking as he embarks on his studies at Cambridge in the early 1960s. While the film takes its time in the theoretical physicists later years the first half-hour feels unnecessarily rushed giving only the faintest impression of Hawkings initial courtship of Jane who proves to be more than capable of sparring with Hawkings formidable intellect. When Hawking is diagnosed with a motor neuron disease and his body begins to cruelly atrophy Everything shifts into its most compelling stretch as Redmayne impressively portrays Hawkings gradual decline and eventual immobility contorting his body strangling his speech and rendering him wholly dependent upon others. (Its easy to get lost in Redmaynes physical metamorphosis so much so that late in the film during a brief lecture sequence the actor reveals just how fully he transformed himself.)Stephen and Janes complicated relationship forms the films spine which doesnt shy away from the tension created upon the arrival of caretakers Jonathan Jones (Charlie Cox) and Elaine Mason (Maxine Peake). Each actor grounds the occasionally sentimental occasionally heady material -- grand theories about black holes and the very beginning of time are made digestible but the physicists lifes work is secondary to the emotional story being told. Director James Marsh best known for his dizzying doc Man on Wire employs a few stylized moments -- the Hawkings wedding is filmed like a home movie -- but otherwise stays out of the way and allows his excellent cast to do their jobs. McCartens screenplay never plunges below the surface and remains content to provide allusions and suggestions sticking to a traditional biopic structure.Not enough can be said about Redmaynes astonishingly committed turn as Hawking -- hell undoubtedly draw comparisons to Daniel Day-Lewiss work as Christy Brown in My Left Foot -- but its the launchpad from which every other actor soars. Jones also proves revelatory ably handling a role that might have been one-note in lesser hands.Although it wrestles with space and time The Theory of Everything ultimately draws you in with its beautifully acted depiction of an unconventional love one ultimately as unknowable as the deepest reaches of our galaxy.

(Liam Daniel/Focus Features) By Ann Hornaday November 13 2014 Follow AnnHornaday Although the awards race officially gets started in early September when spiffed-up contenders make their debuts in film festivals from Venice to Telluride to Toronto Academy Award season doesnt get underway in earnest until the polished anthemic biopics start showing up in theaters. ""The Theory of Everything"" a stirring if conveniently cosmeticized portrait of physicist Stephen Hawking and his wife Jane is such a classic example of Oscar bait that it might as well have arrived with a subtitle attached ""And Theyre Off"" To its credit though this handsome ultimately very moving drama winds up subtly upending as many genre conventions as it obeys. Based on Jane Hawkings memoir ""Travelling to Infinity My Life With Stephen"" ""The Theory of Everything"" doesnt dwell too long on Hawkings most famous intellectual achievements; for brainy disquisitions on space-time singularities and black holes theres always ""Interstellar"" which derives scientific footing from the work of Hawkings colleague Kip Thorne. Rather than a ""Beautiful Mind""-ish portrait of a thinker battling disability filmmaker James Marsh has created a spirited affecting meditation on marriage specifically how Hawkings affliction with a brutally degenerative disease and Janes mostly unflinching support and motivation throughout its worst predations resulted in a relationship that while far from ideal bears celebrating if not emulating entirely. ""The Theory of Everything"" begins in the early 1960s when Hawking -- played by Eddie Redmayne -- is a graduate student at the University of Cambridge and when he meets Jane (Felicity Jones) whos studying medieval Spanish poetry. Gawky and bespectacled full of stumbles and fumbles Hawking takes a severe fall one day and cant get up Soon thereafter hes diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and told he has two years to live. After Hawking descends into an understandable depression Jane shows up to insist that he snap out of it. The two begin to date despite the fact that shes a devout Christian (Church of England) and hes an outspoken atheist who has just ""a slight problem with the celestial dictator premise."" (When Stephen asks Jane out on a Sunday morning and she delicately tells him shes usually busy then he immediately twigs that he has a formidable rival. ""Oh"" he responds knowingly. ""Him."") Directed with graceful vibrancy by Marsh from a script by Anthony McCarten ""The Theory of Everything"" initially has all the markings of the kind of valorizing cine-biography of the safest most conventional kind. Redmayne submerging his fashion-model looks under a performance of remarkable physical and facial contortion lends winsome charm to a character who in real life has often been described as prickly and difficult. And theres no doubt that the filmmakers have smoothed out some of the most problematic contours of the Hawkings marriage -- which ended in 1995 -- in the name of all-important audience ""relatability."" (The fact that Hawking comes off so sympathetically in the film might explain why he allowed his real-life mechanized voice to be used in the film after Redmaynes character receives a tracheotomy in 1985.) But even with those liberties""The Theory of Everything"" succeeds as something deeper and more complex than facile great-man portraiture. Although Redmaynes vulnerable impishness and playful charm virtually erase Hawkings real-life shortcomings theyre still evident especially when as he grows more and more dependent on Jane his demands begin to seem increasingly peevish and cruel. Redmayne is understandably getting most of the accolades for an excruciatingly demanding physical performance that also manages to be surprising expressive. But Jones deserves just as much credit for her less showy but more technically tricky portrayal of a woman who far from being a traditional self-sacrificing helpmate is trying to reconcile her Christian conscience and conjugal devotion with her own academic career and evolving physical and spiritual needs. At its best ""The Theory of Everything"" portrays its central love story not as the stuff of soap-opera melodrama or zero-sum ultimatums but as a relationship between recognizably imperfect adults fraught with many familiar complications contingencies flaws and fatal setbacks. Marsh best known for his sublime 2008 documentary ""Man on Wire"" and making his narrative feature debut here evinces the same penchant for delicacy and lyricism during the denouement of the Hawkings marriage as he does during the idyllic first days of their romance. A stunning third-act sequence when the director briefly sets the characters free from the literalness that binds them isnt just a bold visual move but elevates the story thats gone before. ""The Theory of Everything"" achieves its uplift by acknowledging that uplift isnt always possible at least in the strictest sense Its an exceptional film not because of its protagonists impressive triumphs but because it honors their struggle.    PG-13. At area theaters. Contains thematic elements and some suggestive material. 123 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Photo Liam Daniel McClatchy-Tribune News Service Theory of Everything review Eddie Redmayne uncanny as Stephen Hawking 1 / 6 Back to Gallery Just in physical terms Eddie Redmayne transformations into Stephen Hawking is something remarkable. Most of us are familiar with the wheelchair-using Hawking slouching to one side and speaking with an electronic voice. Redmayne as if drawing a straight line backward turns himself into that Hawking over the course of ""The Theory of Everything"" but slowly one gesture and deterioration at a time -- until the resemblance becomes something between uncanny and downright freakish. Along the way he gives us a sense of Hawkings mind. In scenes from Hawkings student days Redmayne listens to the professors with the special attention of someone who understands all that he hears and is racing ahead to the next conclusion. Later as Hawkings body implodes from motor neuron disease Redmaynes face shows a constant play of emotion and thought he cant express. Using electronics the best he can manage is four words a minute and so he must choose his words carefully. ""The Theory of Everything"" is the story of about 30 years in Hawkings life beginning in the early 1960s when he was pursuing a doctorate in physics at Cambridge. At 21 Hawking is an awkward young man but with the peculiar confidence that comes from excelling within his own specialized sphere. At a party he meets Jane (Felicity Jones) a sober young woman studying Iberian poetry and after a companionable courtship they kiss for the first time at a dance. Related Stories ""Rosewater"" -- so-so movie on a worthy subject Low Down review Hawkes Fanning are soul of 70s biopic American Dreams in China review Sweeping story of friendship A nice almost subliminal virtue of ""Theory of Everything"" is the way that director James Marsh subtly colors each era almost as though were watching something thats partly a memory. The Cambridge scenes are presented in earth tones and crisp photography. The first kiss is the occasion for one of the movies most elaborate shots one that pulls back in a swooping arc to show the two young lovers standing above the city as cars go by below. The 1970s are in sepia -- not the sepia of the 1920s but the muted browns and yellows you get in fading matte-finish photos. Only the more recent years are presented in a straightforward way with no hint of memory or romanticism. The emphasis on the different eras and on what is lost and gained as people move through the years reinforces Hawkings specific area of investigation the nature of time itself. Hawkings work begins to seem like an Olympian attempt to master or at least position himself above the enemy of all things living. As though it were the easiest thing in the world ""The Theory of Everything"" juggles and elaborates on the three main areas of Hawkings life -- his work his illness and his marriage. Anthony McCartens screenplay is based on Jane Hawkings book ""Travelling to Infinity"" but McCarten doesnt enslave himself to specific facts. Jane is strengthened Hawking is softened and incidents are dramatized and yet everything is the service of emphasizing the basic truths. ""The Theory of Everything"" doesnt shy away from depicting the horrors of Hawkings illness nor the strains that it put on his marriage. Felicity Jones plays Jane as a pillar of moral strength and composure. At one point when Stephen can no longer walk she presents him with a wheelchair in that no-need-for-words businesslike way that the English have patented. But we can see in her face that this is a life of no joy the sacrifice of an admirable person who thought she was signing on for a two-year commitment (Stephens life expectancy at the time of their marriage). But Hawking though he fell apart didnt die. Though something sneaky and devious comes across in Hawking -- this giant all-seeing brain attached to a shriveled stalk -- he becomes a heroic figure in a completely earned and unfussy way. Just as he tried as a young man to think himself beyond the world beyond the solar system and beyond the galaxy as a sick man he tries to think himself beyond his body and project his mind out into the universe. What a mismatch All the mysteries of creation versus a single man with not only one hand tied behind his back but two arms two legs and a torso. And yet Hawking has remained game for the fight. What could be more resilient or laudable? Mick LaSalle is The Chronicles movie critic. E-mail mlasallesfchronicle.com. Twitter MickLaSalle The Theory of Everything Drama.

VPC Bill Goodykoontz USA TODAY NETWORK 1257 p.m. MST November 13 2014Eddie Redmayne is brilliant in his portrayal of Stephen Hawking the famous physicist capturing his struggles and triumphs but also his humanity.Felicity Jones as Jane Wilde and Eddie Redmayne as Stephen Hawking in a scene from the motion picture ""The Theory of Everything.""(Photo Focus Features)Story HighlightsCritics review 4 starsEddie Redmayne is outstanding as Stephen Hawking.Felicity Jones too is terrific in the less showy role.The film is somewhat conventional and all but ignores the science but the performances carry it.""The Theory of Everything"" breaks down simply perhaps too much so a great performance in a good movie.Eddie Redmayne is stunning in his portrayal of Stephen Hawking the brilliant physicist who has amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS -- more commonly known as Lou Gehrigs disease. It has crippled his body but spared his astounding mind and director James Marsh and Redmayne are unsparing in the portrayal of that cruel dichotomy.Related Qamp;A with Eddie RedmayneBut its not just an exercise in trying to one-up Daniel Day-Lewis in ""My Left Foot""-style acting. Where Redmayne really succeeds is in the little things the arch of an eyebrow the sparkle of an eye -- pretty much anything with his eyes really because eventually they (and his trusty voice synthesizer) are the only means of communication left to him.But the film is not just about Hawking. Its about his relationship with his former wife Jane on whose memoir ""Travelling to Infinity My Life with Stephen"" Anthony McCarten based his screenplay. The highs lows and decided difficulties are approached with honesty; the guy may be one of the worlds great geniuses but he was no piece of cake to live with something that extends beyond his growing disability.More azcentral.coms newest movie reviewsWe first meet Stephen as a doctoral student at Cambridge where he meets Jane (Felicity Jones) at a party he doesnt quite seem to know how to navigate. Shes also a graduate student and is charmed (as are we) by his unkempt hair and ready smile. He challenges her gently on her belief in God. (""Im busy on Sundays"" she tells him after he asks for a date. ""Oh right. Him"" he replies looking upward.)But they are a good fit despite their differences.Then Stephen receives his devastating diagnosis The disease will kill him within two years.Except it doesnt. He will theorize about the beginning of time chuck it for a boundless universe without beginning or end delve into black holes write ""A Brief History of Time"" (which has sold more than 10 million copies) and much more.To the public this is a remarkable achievement. It is around the house too but its also taxing on Jane to say the least. She and Stephen have three children. (Does the disease affect everything a friend asks clearly meaning you know everything. ""Different system"" Stephen replies.)After resisting outside help the Hawkings hire Jonathan (Charlie Cox) the director of the church choir Jane has joined in one of her rare not-caring-for-Stephen-and-the-kids activities. Jonathans wife has recently died and he seems to appreciate Jane in ways that Stephen cant (or maybe just wont).Meanwhile Stephen hires a woman (Maxine Peake) whose doting admiration and domineering attention excite him. Credit the filmmakers with not treating a story of overcoming adversity as a happy-ever-after fairy tale.Eddie Redmayne stars as Stephen Hawking in the film ""The Theory of Everything."" (Photo Focus Features)We dont learn a lot about the actual science however. Not that most of us would understand it. But from what we can tell theorems and revolutionary ideas spring forth complete from Stephens brain like perfect pieces of music from Mozarts in the ""Amadeus"" version of things.Jones is in the obviously less showy role pretty remarkable herself. There are moments when she is clearly exasperated but when crisis strikes it becomes obvious that her first role is to keep running the business that is Hawking Inc.But there is no talking about this movie without talking about Redmaynes performance. It would have been -- not easy exactly but easier to simply play the increasing physical struggles Stephen faced as the disease took hold. What is more difficult is holding on to that spark not just of intellect and creativity but of the impish mischief that Stephen has always been known for. Redmayne captures this again without overdoing it. You dont get the idea you are watching an acting class. Instead you feel like youre watching a man fight with all he has to retain what makes him him even as the universe he seeks to understand tries to wrest it from him.AZCENTRALThe Theory of Everything (2014) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsThe Theory of Everything4 starsDirector James Marsh.Cast Eddie Redmayne Felicity Jones David Thewlis.Rating PG-13 for some thematic elements and suggestive material.Note At Harkins Camelview 5.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

November 13 2014 -- 247pm Focus Features Felicity Jones and Eddie Redmayne are Jane and Stephen Hawking in ""The Theory of Everything"" based on Jane Hawkings memoir. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert Occasionally -- well rarely -- you encounter a performance so fine that it overtakes the bland movie surrounding it. ""The Theory of Everything"" is a rather dreary biography of the renowned physicist Stephen Hawking one of the most intelligent humans alive. And yet the wonderful character actor Eddie Redmayne plays the role so vividly that the films shortcomings stop mattering. His turn is amusingly playful and emotionally touching. To call it excellent is an understatement. The picture follows Hawking from the promise of his youth to the seemingly insurmountable challenge of his middle age. It takes us through his beginning as a Cambridge University physics prodigy through his crippling motor neuron disorder through his marriage to fellow student Jane White (Felicity Jones) and the births of their three children. Throughout its Redmaynes intense performance that is the storys central pull. There is fervor in his every moment on-screen even as Hawkings mobility and speech fail. Especially then. The more limited Hawkings movement and language become the more Redmayne communicates with an insightful glance. Even at the opening before Hawking grasps the sickness stalking him Redmayne makes his physical gestures expressive. The first moment we see the 20-year-old hes bike racing a friend along the streets to school. Hawking looks a little wobbly but his expression is joyful. He keeps glancing back over his shoulder though that might steer him into a crash. He just wants to be sure hes beating his buddy. Redmayne who dieted to starvation to play the scrawny young student has a lot of fun in his healthy early scenes. He grins as the coxswain of the college rowing team kids his pals flirts with the nicest girl at a 1960s get-together. His Hawking is a lively popular adventurous type. A bit absent-minded about lab reports for his physics courses hes smart and creative enough to deliver last-minute submissions of uncanny brilliance. What he is unaware of is that his pattern of tripping and clumsiness is serious. Hawking stumbles in a painful close-up going headfirst onto the schoolyard sidewalk with a slam. Doctors discover his neurological disease and warn that hell be dead in two years. He falls into depression listening alone to Richard Wagners melancholy music. Its there that Jane White rescues him. She becomes Jane Hawking giving him something special and someone remarkable to live for. The film shows in detail how Janes unstinting support kept her husband going caring for him giving him a nice house and loving family. He stays committed to his work and their relationship even when he comes to move in a wheelchair with his head falling sideways. At times there are good adult-rated laughs even as his speech fades. A friend asks the ill but romantic husband about his involvement with attractive Jane ""Does your disease affect you know everything?"" Hawking whispers ""Different system."" THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING 1/2 out of 4 stars Rated PG-13 for some thematic elements and suggestive material. Theater Edina. Unluckily the story is often sluggish and stolid. Jane Hawkings memoir ""Traveling to Infinity My Life With Stephen"" is the films primary source which gives her a leading role in the saga. It could be the experience of a triumphant genius who outlived all the doctors predictions. Instead it is a generic Harlequin romance featuring a paralyzed scientist who speaks with a mechanical voice. The marriage does not last forever. The film makes the pairs separation more important than Hawkings profound theories. And its all written with reserved British civility. Theres not much surging drama for Jones to act out. Janes anger and bitterness at Hawkings infidelity is downplayed stiff-upper-lip style. Similarly her attraction to the church choirmaster she eventually married is admitted but not explored. Redmaynes empathetic performance is the movies deepest exploration of Hawkings amazing personality. Its also the best reason for seeing it.

Comments (1) click to enlarge The Theory of Everything Recommended Video Rated PG-13  123 minutes  2014 A largely emotional portrait of a formidably cerebral figure this biopic of theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking focuses on his 30-year marriage to Jane Wilde and his struggle to live life to the fullest despite the relentless wasting effects of motor neuron disease. The stark contrast between Hawkings extraordinary intellect and his extraordinary physical handicap has made him an object of public fascination for decades yet the film is most striking for the fact that apart from the practical problems of quadriplegia the couples relationship seems so ordinary. For all the scientific rhetoric about the nature of time what matters most here is how it forges and then tests the bond between two people.

"The Theory of Everything review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review The Theory of Everything The Theory of Everything trailer Trailer for ""The Theory of Everything"" starring Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones Trailer for ""The Theory of Everything"" starring Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Eddie Redmayne plays Stephen Hawking in love and marriage and then a second marriage. Relationally you cant entirely trust what youre seeing in ""The Theory of Everything"" the romanticized portrait of astrophysicist superstar Stephen Hawking and his many years spent with his first wife Jane Hawking. Yet biopics are funny this way Even satisfying ones can fudge and elide and gloss over any number of difficulties while in this instance offering a steadily absorbing and movingly acted depiction of a marriage whose time comes and then goes.Eddie Redmayne last seen trembling with grief nobly in ""Les Miserables"" plays Hawking before and in the thick of his motor neuron disease. Felicity Jones portrays the woman initially known as Jane Wilde whose recent memoir ""Travelling to Infinity My Life with Stephen"" was the basis of screenwriter Anthony McCartens adaptation. This was the heavily revised second memoir she wrote on the subject. More on that in a bit. When we meet Redmaynes Hawking in the 1963 Cambridge University scenes hes a gangly grinning bundle of intellectual discovery ogling the world (and women) through enormous black horn-rimmed glasses pursuing his own theory of the origin of the universe. Director James Marsh whose superb work in documentaries includes ""Man on Wire"" and ""Project Nim"" brings Stephen and Jane together as a golden couple. The film is a story of a marriage that survives for a long time in the face of crushing disease and within the framework of a caretaker scenario that led to Janes depression in the midst of Stephens increasing global fame.The trailers for ""The Theory of Everything"" hint at the real-life couples romantic travails. Their three kids always nearby Jane ended up with their friend choirmaster Jonathan Hellyer Jones (Charlie Cox). Stephen left Jane for his nurse Elaine Mason (Maxine Peake). The movies pretty light on matters of science. It works best as a study of human vulnerability and loves way with us all and as such a handsomely mounted slightly hollow picture by the end becomes a very affecting one. Now Setting facts aside how ""authentic"" are the relationships imagined here? A much bleaker image of the Hawkings lives together emerged from the pages of the 1999 memoir Jane published under the title ""Music to Move the Stars."" She acknowledged that she wrote it in the wake of ""a horrendously painful divorce."" The one we see in ""The Theory of Everything"" does not answer to that description. Janes initial memoirs description of Stephen as a ""puppeteer"" and an imperious narcissistic ""emperor"" led to fearsome blowback. Jane later said she learned ""that you cant write exactly as you think."" Latest movies reviewedOpen link ""The Theory of Everything"" takes out a lot of the mess. Marsh nonetheless manages a film worth seeing. Redmayne has often seemed like not quite enough on screen; in the trifle ""My Week With Marilyn"" opposite Michelle Williams his freckled ice-cream face (to twist an Odets line from ""Sweet Smell of Success"") was photogenic but the performance never sparked. Now though as Hawking he has the most interesting role of his young career and he proves hes fully up to it both in his rigorous physical depiction of the progressive diseases results and in capturing Hawkings wit.In a more recessive role Jones is no less impressive. She hints at Janes internal struggles even when the film itself chooses a more decorous route. The best scene in ""The Theory of Everything"" is the breakup itself. The way Marsh lingers for a telling few seconds on Stephen as he weighs the decision to send a very important message to his wife which will be translated into the famous Hawking voice the films polite drawbacks fade.

"Theory of Everything The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; theory-of-everything-the ) Theory of Everything The (United Kingdom 2014) November 12 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli James Marshs The Theory of Everything is an unremarkable bio-pic about a remarkable man. Its ordinariness is in large part compensated for by an extraordinary performance from lead actor Eddy Redmayne. Those looking for a chronology of the life of Stephen Hawking from 1963 until around 2000 will find it here. Like Jobs however in attempting to cover so much time it uses an episodic approach that skips over key moments and rushes through others. The Theory of Everything shows Hawkings brilliance courage and tenacity but more often than not it skims the surface. At age 72 Hawking has defied the odds. Diagnosed 50 years ago with ALS (Lou Gehrigs Disease) Hawking has not only extended his original death sentence by 48 years but despite losing the use of almost the entirety of his body has challenged and changed fundamental scientific views about cosmology and time. The Theory of Everything gives us a sense of this but the glimpse is fleeting. We are expected to take it on faith that Hawking is brilliant; explaining why that is the case would make this into a dry and potentially indecipherable motion picture. (Those with a real desire to learn more are advised to read Hawkings A Brief History of Time or watch the Errol Morris documentary loosely based on it.) The narrative presented in The Theory of Everything is based on the memoir of Hawkings first wife Jane (played in the film by Felicity Jones) so it concentrates less on theoretical physics and more on the real-life difficulties encountered by the couple difficulties that eventually ended their marriage. We first encounter Hawking as a graduate student at Cambridge a brilliant 22-year old uncertain of the field in which he wants to specialize. Hawking is gangly awkward and a little clumsy but those things dont stop him from pursuing a relationship with an attractive liberal arts major by the name of Jane. As the two fall in love and Hawkings interests begin gravitating toward the study of black holes and the origins of the universe he is dealt a devastating blow he has ALS. His mind will remain unclouded but his control over his body will deteriorate. The doctors give him two years to live. Jane becomes his lifeline from the whirlpool of depression into which he sinks. The two marry and over the next decade have three children. Hawking becomes confined to a wheelchair and after an emergency tracheotomy loses his voice. Caring for Hawking and his children becomes too much for Jane. She seeks the aid of others including the full-time nurse who will eventually become Hawkings second wife. Eddy Redmaynes performance is attracting Oscar buzz and its no wonder this is the kind of astonishing physical transformation that the Academy often admires and acknowledges. (Think Daniel Day-Lewis in My Left Foot.) Not only does Redmayne look the part of Hawking but he provides viewers with a painful understanding of the slow degeneration of the physicists motor skills. By the end of the film Redmayne is acting with little more than his face and eyebrows yet despite those limitations he conveys not only emotion but an understanding of how feverishly Hawkings trapped brain continues to function. Felicity Jones although working in Redmaynes shadow provides an appealing Jane. In many ways The Theory of Everything is more about her struggle than her husbands. In the beginning shes convinced that their love will be enough and together they can win the battle. By the end beaten down and bedraggled she is forced to admit defeat. Like most well-made bio-pics The Theory of Everything takes us on a long winding journey but the lack of conflict makes the film an occasionally dry experience. Everyone is presented as good and decent. (Perhaps this is one reason why Hawking so enthusiastically endorsed the production.) When Jane falls in love with her church choir director their relationship remains platonic out of respect for Hawking. The Theory of Everything is about Janes psychological and emotional struggles but the manner in which it rockets through the years mutes the intensity of those difficulties. Marsh (whose most notable previous endeavor was the documentary Man on Wire) has provided us with a jumping-off point for those who want to learn more about Hawking but this is by no means a definitive or innovative cinematic biography.

Check.A bittersweet romance? Check.A performance from an actor who undergoes a startling transformation? Check.But ""The Theory of Everything"" is so much more than a cheap grab at Oscar.James Marshs tender and true film is one of the most rewarding cinematic experiences of 2014. Emotionally satisfying and intellectually stimulating ""Theory"" chronicles the soulful and complicated relationship between famed scientist Stephen Hawking and his first wife Jane. (L-R) Harry Lloyd as Brian and Eddie Redmayne as Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything. (Liam Danie/Focus Features) ( Liam Daniel ) While much has been written about Eddie Redmaynes stunning performance as Hawking the ALS-afflicted physicist who wrote the landmark 1988 science book ""A Brief History of Time"" theres another acting tour de force demanding attention. Felicity Jones is incredible as Jane the medieval-lit major who met and fell in love with the geeky but charming cosmologist while both attended Cambridge in 1980s.Advertisement In early previews ""The Theory of Everything"" seemed like it might be another run-of the-mill film bio taking a depressing one-note approach to a couple dealing with one partners debilitating disease. But ""Theory"" is more complicated and doesnt follow the conventional romance template. As its title posits ""The Theory of Everything"" covers a lot of territory and intelligently digs into the nitty-grittiness of being in love being a caretaker and being a genius. It also immerses us into such heady topics black holes and relativity in which Hawking delivered some important advancements but brings those brainiac matters up more elegantly than what was presented in Christopher Nolans ""Interstellar."" Marsh who deservedly won an Oscar for his 2008 documentary ""Man on Wire"" (about daredevil Philippe Petit) and screenwriter Anthony McCarten engage our brain cells in a more organic less flustery way. They also dont sentimentalize their source material Jane Hawkings memoir ""Travelling to Infinity My Life With Stephen.""What they and their cast accomplish is to move us in unexpectedly powerful ways. Unlike other recent films ""Theory"" struck me profoundly powerful with sequences where few words were spoken yet volumes were being expressed.To convey so much without grand gestures actors must be fully committed the material and their characters. Such is the case here.Redmayne who was one of the high points of ""Les Miserables"" achieves acting greatness as Hawking. In the first scenes we appreciate why Jane was attracted to this young man with the radiant smile and an effortless intellect. His is a demanding physical role and Redmayne is in full control of it as Stephen defies the two-year death sentence decreed by his doctor but then sees his motor skills deteriorating. Its wrenching to watch and recalls elements of Daniel Day-Lewiss Oscar-winning performance in ""My Left Foot."" Jones so good at playing Charles Dickens young lover in Ralph Fiennes ""The Invisible Woman"" brings to life a vibrant woman who is more spiritual than her partner yet also fiercely intelligent. Jones makes us feel the conflicting range of emotions that a caregiver experiences. So its no surprise she enjoys spending time with a handsome and lonely church choir director Jonathan Hellyer Jones (an endearing Charlie Cox).""The Theory of Everything"" is not afraid to reveal honest intimate and emotionally painful moments in this couples relationship. We witness two characters who are heroic but human as they struggle to get to heart in the center of their own universes.

Such is almost but not quite the case with ""The Theory of Everything"" a sweet restrained and overstretched film about the unusual relationship between physicist Stephen Hawking and his former wife Jane. Director James Marsh (already an Oscar winner for the documentary ""Man on Wire"") and screenwriter Anthony McCarten (adapting Jane Hawkings memoir) opt for the safe pretty and reassuring English period-piece choices the whole way through as if deliberately underselling the fact that this is a story about two remarkable people facing extraordinary circumstances.I recognize its a cop-out to dismiss a film worked on for years by talented people as Oscar-bait as if that summed up all its qualities. Surely there is room in the universe for inspiring biopics tales of repressed romance and subtly shaded compositions featuring people wearing cardigans and tweed jackets in front of Gothic architecture. I do rather wish the fall season werent quite so full of such nostalgic ""Kings Speech""-inspired fare; this year alone we have two different Oscar-oriented prestige films about Cambridge professors. (This one and ""The Imitation Game"" with Benedict Cumberbatch as code-breaking mathematician and proto-computer genius Alan Turing.)If the handsome but utterly familiar framing of ""The Theory of Everything"" puts the compelling performances of Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones front and center thats obviously the point. You couldnt create a more awards-ready role than that of Stephen Hawking a world-famous scientist who has not only survived a severe debilitating illness far longer than anyone expected but endured it with apparent good humor and considerable insight. That said Redmayne - who remains little known on this side of the Atlantic - never surrenders to stereotype capturing not just the nuances of Hawkings physical disability but also his puckish humor and sometimes prickly personality. Theres an unexpectedly moving scene late in the film when Stephen delivers Jane both good news and bad news - two big acknowledgments that in a sense shes been waiting for - that captures something essential about Hawkings isolation from the rest of humanity.Felicity Jones has a more difficult row to hoe in playing Jane a character we never get to know all that well perhaps because the story sticks close to her perspective. Jane was a pretty proper English rose of the intellectual variety a scholar of medieval Romance poetry who had no idea she was falling in love with the most important physicist of his era or with a man who was about to develop symptoms of motor neuron disease or ALS which in the 1960s typically led to death within two or three years. She agreed to marry Stephen and bear his children knowing that the road ahead would be arduous and that she would likely be a young widow. One of the most interesting subtexts of ""The Theory of Everything"" - and the interesting stuff in this movie is almost all subtext - is the fact that the real bargain turned out to be very different indeed. You Might Also Like Roughly the first half of Marshs film blends three strands of melodrama The uneasy romance between apparent opposites - the atheist brainiac with socialist leanings and the devoutly religious young woman with a passion for poetry and music - the progress of Stephens disease and the development of his scientific genius. I suppose theres no way to do the latter justice in a mainstream movie but all we get in ""The Theory of Everything"" is the vague impression that Hawking originally had the mathematical insight that the universe began with a singularity akin to a black hole but has more recently developed a different and perhaps contradictory conception of the ""boundaryless universe."" There is literally no discussion about why these ideas were revolutionary how they altered the course of cosmological theory and what sorts of doors they opened for others such as the various iterations of ""multiverse"" theory that are all the rage these days.So fair enough - this isnt a movie for Ph.D. candidates in physics and as a famous anecdote from Hawkings grad-school years reveals most physics Ph.D. candidates felt overwhelmed by his intellect anyway. So what is this movie about? In its strongest and quietest moments ""The Theory of Everything"" is about an unconventional marriage with an unconventional destination and about the fact that not every love story has to end with ""happily ever after"" to be deemed acceptable. Since many people may see the movie who dont know much about the Hawkings real-life marriage I wont go further than that. For me the point of universal connection lay in the fact that marriage is always difficult and always involves sacrifices on both sides and a lot of mutual miscomprehension. What Jane and Stephen Hawking faced was an exaggerated version of that under exceptional circumstances and in the public eye but its still something many of us can recognize. Any film made about two living people with their cooperation is necessarily going to be limited by considerations of tact and taste and that goes double or triple in this case. Theres a mildly subversive fable about the unpredictable nature of love and life to be found in ""The Theory of Everything"" beneath the ultra-English character-actor performances (David Thewlis as Stephens professor and mentor; Simon McBurney as his father; Jonathan Hellyer Jones as Stephens caretaker and Janes um close friend) the wistful sepia-toned montages and cinematographer Benoit Delhommes chronically picturesque images. You have to dig to find it and it doesnt have much to do with Hawkings quixotic quest for an equation that would explain all of physical reality. Its more about how to make the best of the time we get with each other in a highly imperfect universe which is all the everything those of us dumber than Hawking will ever understand.

THIS By the time Christopher Nolan gets to that moment hes already contorted the plot enough times to deliver on a promise of entertainment. Weve seen Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway put on space suits and fling themselves across the universe; weve experienced a new maybe more accurate representation of wormholes. There are robot sidekicks with settings for humor and discretion that look like a brainteaser had a baby with the Monolith from 2001; theres the appearance of an unbilled movie star who injects some real poignancy and suspense. More Interstellar The Fault in Our Stars The Empty Wonder of Christopher Nolans Interstellar and the Overwrought The Theory of Everything Brothers in BRONG How Hans Zimmer and Christopher Nolan Make the Boldest Scores in Hollywood Should You See Interstellar? A Curious Consumers Decision-Making Guide Floating in a Most Familiar Way 21 Notes About Sci-Fi After 2001 A Space Odyssey We Went There Tunneling Through the Hype of the Interstellar Oculus Rift Experience Interstellar asks -- in all seriousness -- Are we there yet? And what does ""there"" even mean? Once this movie got to where it was going (that takes about two and a half hours) I had an involuntary spasm of laughter. What else could I do? Partly I laughed at the cleverness of the revelation. The sequence delivers. And partly I laughed because Nolan believes cleverness is the same thing as audacity. He thinks that the click of realization is profound that its the key -- when really its just the gears of a giant machine locking into place. All of this effort all of these questions all of this movie and for what? There is no there there. Nolan might like to think that with Memento The Prestige Inception and now Interstellar hes exploring important existential questions (and frequently writing with his brother Jonathan he actually is) but theres always the sense that the person making these movies has no sense of thematic proportionality. The ""about"" is out of whack with the ""what."" These movies are about Loss. Theyre about Love. Theyre also spiritually generic. They require a lot of production just to make ""change"" rhyme with ""rearrange."" With Interstellar you know youre in for it when in the opening scenes its clear the movie is about Family -- the mythic farm family the stuff of paintings and WPA photographs. Not America per se but Americana. The Nolans plant some actual characters onto that landscape but its too arid for anything interesting to grow. McConaughey plays Joseph ""Coop"" Cooper a widowed engineer whose ace piloting skills are as vestigial as this movies Field of Dreams version of baseball now appears to be. The government of the agrarian state needs him to farm corn which he does with his father-in-law (John Lithgow) and two kids 10-year-old Murph (Mackenzie Foy) and teenage Tom (Timothee Chalamet). The planet is down to its last drops. Crackpots are teaching junk history in the schools. Children are being told they can only become farmers. And the air is increasingly rich with gas that will soon cause everyone to suffocate. Interspersed amid the early action are documentary clips featuring older folks (including one played by Ellen Burstyn) who recall years of blight and one particularly cataclysmic dust storm. Theyre like interviews from a Ken Burns film playing in a gallery at some historical museum. More Awards SeasonAll of our Oscar coverage The story begins well after whatever environmental catastrophe wiped out much of mankind but just in time for the last okra harvest. Now the only thing left to grow is corn suggesting that Nolan has either a great sense of self-deprecating irony or none. Murph believes ghosts haunt their farmhouse. How else to explain the books that leap from the shelf in her bedroom to the floor? Coop tells Murph to turn to science to explain the ghosts. Perhaps the ghosts were what inspired him to hop into his pickup truck drive to the middle of nowhere and stumble upon the secret headquarters of NASA which because agriculture has trumped aeronautics functions as an immense underground laboratory. That happens to be where scientists including a professor named Brand (Michael Caine) have been working for years to find earthlings a new home on a distant planet. A handful of manned probes have been sent up for exploration. One system is showing potential and Coop is asked to pilot a confirmation mission (on a ship called Endurance) that includes Brands daughter Amelia (Hathaway) an astrophysicist (David Gyasi) a geographer (Wes Bentley) and that pair of robots the talkier of which is voiced drolly by Bill Irwin. The rub of the mission is the matter of relativity. What hours are to the Endurance crew are years back on Earth. The longer they take to get answers the older their loved ones will get. Sadly until Foy ages into Jessica Chastain you dont care to spend much time at NASA and even then youre just waiting for Nolan to get to the good stuff. As Endurance powers through wormholes and enters inhospitable environments the director gets to dazzle just as he did with all of the larcenous burrowing in Inception. That movie went down. Interstellar goes out. What Nolan lacks in intellectual and emotional depth he makes up for in pliable vastness. (He does more refolding than a stock girl at the Gap.) But at his best he makes you believe that the worlds hes inventing have no end and that time and space truly are as manipulable as he claims.  Nolans cosmic wonder is tethered to so much hoariness. No one does anything in one time frame that doesnt eventually bear upon another moment. Everyone speaks in portents with nostalgia and lament. Lithgows character remembers when mankind was trying to create and invent. ""We were doers"" he says ""not caretakers."" When Murph complains to Coop that the kids at school teasingly assume she was named after Murphys Law he has to explain what that is. The best interactions in the movie occur much later when theres more at stake and Chastain and Hathaway get something to play. Wounded anger might be to Chastain what melisma is to Mariah Carey home. In the thick of the mission Coop and Amelia are surprised by a practical dilemma -- the Endurance has the capacity for only one more wormhole jaunt and has to choose between two destinations. Amelia has a personal reason for preferring one. The other is a more random crapshoot. They argue over whether her emotional reasoning makes less sense than his pragmatism. The scene gives Hathaway an opportunity for her eyes to go glassy and for her goosey manner to sour. Everything imposing about her comes from the narrowing of those eyes. Theyre like phases of the moon. McConaugheys return to space is his first since nearly denying Jodie Foster the opportunity in Contact. He coasts on his cowboy guile here. Hes almost too charismatic for this kind of heartland dystopia but he modulates effectively. If only Nolan knew how to build a movie up with emotion that didnt come exclusively from good acting. The farther out Interstellar goes the more bound to tired feelings it becomes. Fear of never again seeing a parent or a child should get to you more than it does here. But it feels as if father-daughter bonds were the best they could do. Its conceptual and taken for granted rather than explored. The Americana is meant as a kind of shorthand. Coop and Murphs bond across time isnt meant to move; its supposed to represent all such bonds. Nolan is a pop director but a limited one. For him a powerful image doesnt exactly involve people and emotion; rather its about figures in motion. With something like Inception or the last two installments of his Dark Knight trilogy that power can get to you even if some of its ultimately senseless. But here the movie is too notional to be affecting. The most touching thing that occurs involves a character putting his arms around another. Its unexpected -- for him the other characters and us. Its the one time the film opens into the sort of harrowing existential place that Alfonso Cuaron sustained for all of Gravity. Interstellar doesnt fully recover from it and that passage goes off the rails because Nolan feels like he has to give himself an action sequence. But why? For a visionary hes surprisingly cautious and some of that caution makes him seem naive. Take all the talk of love in Interstellar -- as a feeling as inspiration as a physical property. The Swiss Army knife treatment dulls the movies scientific cutting edge. Love is what makes us human. Its also what makes a Subaru a Subaru.  Great outer-space science fiction confronts you with the vastness of a void. It doesnt have any answers because there are none. Something like Stanley Kubricks 2001 A Space Odyssey operated in discrete movements. I watch it at least once a year hoping to get closer to a true understanding. But meaning in any strict sense is tantalizingly elusive. Kubrick was dreaming and thats the dream other directors often seem helpless trying to reproduce. So many movies want to evoke Kubricks but its dispiriting that so few feel free to go as far as he did. Its not just the light show. Its his insistence on creepiness and human smallness and angst. You can go anywhere in the movies. So Kubrick did. The original iterations of Star Wars and Star Trek took up the boundless cause of the space odyssey. Steven Spielbergs Close Encounters of the Third Kind from 1977 brought outer space to Earth but only to present a fathers sugar-free abandonment of his family in order to hang out with aliens as an act of follow-your-bliss heroism. It remains the most movingly obnoxious completely sincere ending Ive ever seen in a Hollywood movie. What a crazy way to send home an audience. But Spielberg earned that ending. That film was about religious calling and the confirmation of faith. Theres that great moment up at the mountain lab where the scientists play for the spaceships the five-tone electronic micro-symphony and theres a cut to Melinda Dillon up in the rocks singing along in frustrated rapture. ""I know that"" she says through tears all the work and faith and presumed insanity paying off. You get emotional with her. Spielberg is a wide-shot director. His power as an emotionalist arrives at the moment when it all clicks for everybody when the personal becomes popular when belief upends doubt in public when many become one. Nolan doesnt have Spielbergs skill with framing. But when Nolan is on he can make the popular private the immense intimate. Hes also more convincing when circumstances are grim. The Dark Knights nihilism was the most comprehensively persuasive atmosphere hes conjured. He bore into some of those characters even while building a wider urban world. The atmosphere was viral. When district attorney Harvey Dent becomes the villain Two-Face its past the films halfway point. Dents girlfriend has just been blown up. He makes an arguably rational embrace of the movies bleakness. That films characters felt like a breakthrough for Nolan whos a better puzzle-maker than a pure storyteller. What makes you laugh about him when some of his non-Batman films reach their climax is his apparent belief that the puzzle is doing more work than it is. For me the mere ingenuity of the puzzle is enough. But its not for him. Hes got to build for his movies the soul that other films are born with. In Interstellar Nolan pours on and misconstrues Dylan Thomass ""Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night"" refurbishes warped dreamscapes from Inception and ends the film three times. The images photographed in 70mm Imax by Hoyte Van Hoytema are as gorgeous as youd expect. (The many non-Imax shots look sludgy at that scale.) But the incongruity becomes funny. He doesnt realize these people just arent as cool or compelling as outer space. While youre sitting there with McConaughey hovering in a mild panic (this man does not freak out) and Nolans grand machine of a movie has just clicked into place it occurs to you that for all the relativity and eternity Interstellar itself is small. It gives you everything you want in a vision of the future everything except awe.  Liam Daniel/Focus Features ""There should be no boundary to the human endeavor"" were told at some point in The Theory of Everything. But how would this movie know? There are enough boundaries in it to induce claustrophobia. The mind of the cosmologist Stephen Hawking would seem to be its own kind of deep space but who needs that when youve got access to his heart? This movie is even more comfortable with the familiar than Nolans. Its based on the memoir Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones) wrote about her marriage to Hawking (Eddie Redmayne). In the film they meet at a University of Cambridge party in 1963. While ""Heat Wave"" is playing he sees her across the room. They dont dance. But talking on the stairs they do make a connection that leaves him infatuated. Later when he sees her at a pub shes seated next to a boy. Thats more a minor obstacle than a red flag. Hes the one who pulls away as Lou Gehrigs disease begins to hijack his body. First hes unable to operate clothespins. Then hes walking with two canes like a sort of upright crustacean. Eventually hes left in a palsied rictus that requires a wheelchair. After his diagnosis Jane has to chase him around campus to profess her love. Hes been told that hes got only two years to live and says he needs to get to work. But the disease seems to make her want him all the more. Cue the elevator music set to a wedding/baby-at-home montage. (The movie gets a kick out of Hawkings working genitals.) The marriage itself is a triumph of patience and admiration but it isnt easy. The film quietly shifts its focus to Jane whose academic career stalls while his soars. The children keep coming. Stephen frolics with them while Jane sits at the kitchen table with an open book forlorn. ""Join the church choir"" says her mother (Emily Watson). ""Thats possibly the most English thing anyone has ever said"" Jane replies. But of course in the next scene she drops by a church and makes inquiries to a cute young organist Jonathan Hellyer Jones (Charlie Cox) who becomes both her lover and a member of the family volunteering with Stephens blessing to help with Hawkings care. Director James Marsh (Man on Wire) and screenwriter Anthony McCarten are content to make a melodrama. While Jane and Jonathan consummate their affair on a camping trip Stephen is in Bordeaux at a Wagner opera. Obviously while they make love Stephen falls ill and the cameras cutting confers a kind of guilt upon the affair producing possibly the most English juxtaposition anyone has ever attempted. As the lovers drive away from the campsite theres a cut to the taillights of the car in front of them filling the screen with red. No you stop From there on out its nothing but tedious decorum -- Graham Greene without the fervor or shame. These are good people behaving altruistically. The peals of laughter from Stephens new assistant Elaine Mason (Maxine Peake) arouse Janes envy but only because you sense that she feels shes failed to continue delighting her husband. (Mason would become Hawkings second wife in 1995.) Conversations about religion relativity and quantum mechanics rarely leave the dinner table. (""String theory"" refers mostly to Johann Johannssons swollen score.) The accolades just magically pile up for Stephen (along with some unusually good middle-age makeup for both Hawkings). Marsh furnishes some nice touches. Jane gives Stephen her phone number and he stares at the digits as if theyre an equation to solve. Some of the flourishes are distractingly precious. Theres a shot in a staircase thats made to resemble geometrys golden spiral; Stephens interest in the reversal of time inspires the movie to play itself backward at the end. And Jones is nearly always in green or framed near it. She doesnt have much to act. Virtue and guilt arent the most vivid qualities and she doesnt get to perform any variations on them. Half the time shes playing a negligible consecration. Its like watching a talking postage stamp. What Redmayne does is impressive. Hes not worried about being understood. When he speaks his head is thrown back and his mouth up like a drowning person immersed to his lips in water. Thats how he sounds too. He resembles the young Hawking and is made to resemble the old. (The real Hawking is 72.) But Redmayne isnt doing My Left Brain; the movie doesnt ask for Hawkings prickliness or idiosyncrasy just his purity. To that end Redmayne also looks like Julie Andrews and Hilary Swank and thats what he gives off saintliness. The postage stamp married a pane of stained glass. This all creates a drama that feels good thats moving. But it seems ancillary to Hawkings genius which has gotten fuller riskier tributes from Errol Morris The Simpsons and The Big Bang Theory all featuring the man himself. Morriss 80-minute 1991 documentary -- which shares a title with Hawkings most famous book A Brief History of Time -- dares to find a visual equivalent for Hawkings ideas to connect that thinking to Hawkings life. There are no limits for Morris. The Theory of Everything has wedged that life into such a formula -- the wearisome origin story -- that ultimately it doesnt taste like anything. There might be some value in a depiction of this iconic mans life as human -- that he can have sex and ask for a divorce. But this is a man who when inaccurately told he has two years to live asks ""What about my brain?"" Here? Its pickled.

By Peter Rainer Film critic November 7 2014 Save for later Saved Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones) wins the heart of Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne). LIAM DANIEL/FOCUS FEATURES          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The great British scientist Stephen Hawking is already such an international icon - hes even been portrayed on ""The Simpsons"" - that for him to be the subject of a movie at this point seems almost reductive. ""The Theory of Everything"" starring Eddie Redmayne as Hawking and Felicity Jones as Jane Wilde his first wife is highly uneven but at least it doesnt glamorize Hawkings life or turn it into a paean to endurance. His physical degeneration from motor neuron disease which shut down his muscular control and ultimately rendered him unable to speak on his own is depicted without undue pathos. Diagnosed while studying for his PhD at Cambridge in the mid-1960s he was given only two years to live. He is now 72. His ideas about space-time and black holes revolutionized modern thinking about the universe. His laymans science book ""A Brief History of Time"" is perhaps the most famously unread bestseller ever. In the popular imagination the Hawking iconography is keyed to the image of this slumping speechless man spinning paradigm-shifting cosmic theories from his wheelchair. There is an element of morbidity in this sort of hero-worship that James Marsh who directed ""The Theory of Everything"" from a screenplay by Anthony McCarten generally avoids. (Source material is Jane Hawkings 2007 memoir ""Travelling to Infinity My Life With Stephen"" written 12 years after their 20-year marriage ended). If only the film werent rendered in that flavorless way endemic to biopics (especially British ones) of the famous. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time Jones is terrific - she has a funny offhand moment when she rues the way Stephens electronic voice simulator makes him sound American - but the chief reason to see the film is for Redmayne. This is the first full-scale nonmusical role hes been handed in the movies and it ranks almost up there with Daniel Day Lewiss performance in ""My Left Foot"" though that role allowed Day Lewis far greater emotional latitude. Redmayne like Day Lewis is often at his most physically charged when he is the most physically confined. The early courtship scenes between Stephen and Jane full of gawky gallantry only emphasize Stephens loss when the disease hits. And yet the triumph of Redmaynes performance is that Stephen after he becomes incapacitated is the same eccentric quizzical quester that he was when he was sprinting across the Cambridge campus. He is such a brainiac that his search for a ""theory of everything"" - a unification of quantum physics and Einsteins theory of relativity - overrides triumphantly his debility. The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide The filmmakers fearing perhaps that we might get snarled up in cosmological conundrums play down the physics. I wish they hadnt; they underestimate the audiences own avidity for scientific voyaging (as demonstrated by the success of such PBS series as ""NOVA"" and ""Cosmos"").    I also wish the filmmakers didnt feel the need to provide a counterweight to the cosmology in the form of a running argument between Jane and Stephen about religion. (Shes Anglican; hes an atheist.) Doesnt the confluence of his difficult life and hers already provide an ample arena for conflict? ""The Theory of Everything"" doesnt need this window dressing. It has Redmayne.

But aside from a couple of close calls after My Week With Marilyn and Les Miserables hes never quite gotten that final nudge into full-fledged stardom. Thats about to change. His fearless flawless performance as Stephen Hawking in James Marshs moving new biopic The Theory of Everything is on par with Daniel Day-Lewis in My Left Foot. Hawking the physicist who achieved a fluky sort of pop culture fame in the late 80s as the bard of black holes suffers from a debilitating motor-neuron disease similar to ALS that has confined him to a wheelchair for most of his adult life. But in the movie we are introduced to him before his affliction takes hold when hes just an awkwardly charming Ph.D. student at Cambridge in the 1960s with a mischievous smile a mop of ginger hair and nerdy Buddy Holly glasses. At a mixer he meets and falls in love with a radiant poetry student named Jane (Felicity Jones). Then darkness falls quickly and pitilessly. The cruelest irony is that at the very moment when Hawkings mind was exploding with radically expansive new ideas his physical world was collapsing in on him. But he and Jane refuse to let the disease derail their life and he remains steadfast in his pursuit of a theory about the universe that will alter the course of science. Though the film is conventionally structured and bathed in a for-your-consideration sheen Redmaynes astonishing transformation lends a touch of magic to the material. Even when hes in a wheelchair his torso twisted his limbs gnarled and his ability to speak severely limited the actor conveys Hawkings genius and humanity (not to mention his crackling wit). Its like watching an escape artist whos bound and gagged break free from a straitjacket. What Redmayne does is breathtaking--and it never feels like a performance. In a much less showy role Jones does her own heartbreaking work as the woman who dedicated her life to loving and caring for Hawking. With nuance and grace she summons the pain and frustration that were by-products of that commitment. And yet I couldnt help wishing that The Theory of Everything had more theory. Hawking famously excels at explaining complicated thoughts with layman simplicity but the film never translates the originality and depth of his ideas--or even what they are. Marsh asks us to buy the beauty of Hawkings mind on faith. Hes lucky hes got Redmayne to do his selling.

"The Theory of Everything a film about Stephen Hawking and his marriage reviewed Slate Sign In Sign Up In The Theory of Everything Stephen Hawkings Marriage Is As Complex As the Universe In The Theory of Everything Stephen Hawkings Marriage Is As Complex As the Universe Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 6 2014 1158 AM Cosmic Relief In The Theory of Everything Stephen Hawkings marriage is as complex as the universe. By Dana Stevens Eddie Redmayne in The Theory of Everything. Photo courtesy Liam Daniel/Universal Pictures Internationa The Theory of Everything is the perfect title for James Marshs winning biopic of the theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking--and not only because its also the title of one of Hawkings many best-selling books a collection of Cambridge lectures in which he begins feeling his way toward a unified theory that would bring together the theretofore irreconcilable domains of general relativity and quantum physics. More than a portrait of Hawking the scientist this is a frank dissection of his long and complicated first marriage (to Jane Wilde on whose memoir Travelling to Infinity My Life with Stephen the film is based). And what is the idea of romantic companionate marriage in all its crackpot ""till death us do part"" absolutism if not a theory of everything? Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Neither the question of how to live with and love one other person for the rest of ones life nor that of why matter behaves differently on the macro and micro scale has been solved by human ingenuity. Hawkings version of the unified theory though influential remains speculative and his marriage to Jane did come to an end after more than 30 years together--years in which the mere fact of Hawkings continued survival counted as a miracle given that he had been diagnosed with a highly degenerative neurological disorder as a young man and given two years to live. Fifty years later Hawking is still with us and at 72 still writing and lecturing on scientific concepts that most of us can only grasp for a few seconds at a time. The story of how this man found the inner strength to achieve all he has against such crushing odds might also make for an excellent movie but thats not the story that Marsh (whos best known for the Oscar-winning documentary Man on Wire) wants to tell. The Stephen Hawking of The Theory of Everything--brilliantly played by Eddie Redmayne with a mix of twinkly charm and brusque self-absorption--remains somehow mysterious a never-fully-knowable quantity to his wife or to us. Its Jane (the dazzling Felicity Jones) whose head we get inside--not through the use of voiceover but by dint of the careful attention Benoit Delhommes camera pays to her face and Anthony McCartens script to her lived experience. The inspirational biopic about a person with a disability who triumphs over adversity isnt something new (though a really good one like Julian Schnabels The Diving Bell and the Butterfly can still do something new with the form). But movies that focus on the hardships of life with a disabled spouse can hardly be said to be in oversupply. The Theory of Everything may be conventional in its style of presentation but the films content is surprisingly feminist. Marsh takes apart the myth that behind every great man theres a great woman by showing us the daily strain involved in such unequal partnerships. Advertisement As the film begins in 1963 at a nostalgically lensed Cambridge University Jane is a pretty devoutly religious young humanities student who starts a flirty party chat about cosmology with the atheist Stephen a whiz-kid slacker who scribbles his physics homework on the back of a train schedule but still solves nearly every equation with a speed and elegance that confound his professor (David Thewlis on loan from the faculty of Hogwarts). These scenes of the couples early courtship especially one that takes place on a bridge hung with lights for a school dance are lushly romantic without ever crossing the line into schmaltz. Knowing what these two are about to go through together the audience needs to feel they share an intense and immediate connection; we dont begrudge Stephen and Jane a minute of their meet-cute. (Or in this case I guess meet-smart?) Felicity Jones and Eddie Redmayne in The Theory of Everything. Photo courtesy Liam Daniel/Focus Features Not long after falling head over heels for Jane Stephen takes a literal fall in the university courtyard landing in the hospital. His weakening foot is diagnosed as an early symptom of a nerve disease related to ALS (Lou Gehrigs disease) and hes told hell be dead within a few years. At first the news doesnt sit so well with this ambitious and arrogant young man. He cuts class and holes up morosely in his room leaving Jane to find out about his condition through a common friend. But she insists they carry through with their plans to marry and finish their degrees. Whatever time he has left she tells him she wants the two of them to spend it together. Despite Stephens steadily weakening body the early days of their marriage pass in a happy (if distractingly Instagram-resembling) blur. He begins to publish and teach quickly earning a reputation as a writer of sophisticated and accessibly written popular science while Jane manages his schedule and attends to his ever-increasing needs for bodily care while also raising their children. (They will eventually have three; as Stephen impishly confesses to a male friend not every part of his body is disabled.) Over a frustratingly long period of years Jane at last manages to complete her Ph.D. in medieval Spanish literature. (You had me at ... pretty much all of that last sentence.) But she feels professionally and personally adrift especially after the handsome choir conductor at her church Jonathan (Charlie Cox) awakens her long-dormant need to be not only the caretaker but also the cared-for. Stephen is surprisingly tolerant of that chaste flirtation--which doesnt make him any more sympathetic to Janes pain when years later he becomes attached to his hired nurse Elaine (Maxine Peake). Jones and Redmayne are both superb as a devoted but imperfect pair of headstrong people trying and sometimes failing to treat each other with care and respect. In a technically demanding but resolutely unmawkish performance Redmayne communicates young Stephens rage at the prospect of his own physical degeneration as well as the shame he feels about his growing dependence on his wife and other caretakers. By the time hes confined to a wheelchair and eventually voice-synthesizing machine Hawkings immobilized and twisted body has become as unspectacularly palpable--as simply and evidently there--as his restless searching mind. (And quite frequently his dry sense of humor as when he answers his wife-to-bes inquiries about his religious beliefs by confessing a personal distaste for ""the whole celestial-dictator premise."") Jones a petite English rose-style beauty seems too small and frail at first to rise to the challenge of wrestling a quadriplegic in and out of his wheelchair. But her gradual maturation into a steely matriarch is utterly believable. A scene in which Jane wearily but accurately summarizes her husbands latest complex theory for a dinner guest pausing only to feed the now world-famous physicist peas from a spoon captures the couples complex dynamics of interdependence resentment and collaboration. You could fault the filmmakers as some have for spending so much time on Hawkings romantic entanglements that his scientific innovations go largely unexplored. The physicists theories come in handy here mainly for the abstract truths they symbolize the potentially unlimited reach of human knowledge the melancholy mystery of times unrelenting forward motion. In a late sequence we see Jane and Stephens rocky romance--and his physical decline--heartbreakingly thrown into reverse the weakness leaving his body as he races backward in time to embrace his young bride-to-be on the bridge after that Cambridge dance. To steal another of Hawkings book titles this tender and wise account of the years they had together might be also be titled A Brief History of Time. Then again what marriage couldnt?

Simon Houpt The Globe and Mail Published Friday Nov. 07 2014 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Nov. 07 2014 1200AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by James Marsh Written by Anthony McCarten Starring Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones Classification PG Country USA Language English Marriages are mysterious things even to those of us inside of them but some are more mysterious than others.Two years after Stephen Hawking published his bestselling 1988 cosmology book A Brief History of Time though all but paralyzed with a motor neuron disease he left his wife and the mother of his three children the former Jane Wilde to shack up with his nurse Elaine Mason. Some time later Jane married an old family friend who apparently had been waiting in the wings her choirmaster Jonathan Hellyer Jones. Video Video Why Matthew McConaughey went sci-fi with Interstellar Rita Ora returned home to West London to turn on the Christmas lights at Westfield shopping mall where she performed a number of her hits talked about her new album and her cameo appearance in the movie 50 Shades of Grey. (Nov. 4) AP Video Video Video Rita Ora talks 50 Shades of Grey and new album Even if you were never the sort who cared what goes on behind others closed doors the Hawkings drama is catnip. And if youll excuse the pun you could say it was only a matter of time before Hollywood came calling.Time is at the heart of Hawkings work and it animates The Theory of Everything too. Early on in director James Marshs brainy romantic take on the Hawkings unusual relationship the young PhD student in physics is breathlessly explaining his notion of winding back the cosmic clock. ""What if I reversed the process [of the universes expansion] all the way back to see what happened at the beginning of time?"" he muses to his girlfriend. The lovers link arms and spin like a carousel giggling from their proximity to Hawkings heady theories and each other. They are tipsy on the promise of life. Marsh aims for something similar hoping to wind back the clock to free Hawking from our received image of him as a remote genius who speaks to us through a computer-generated voice.Still we brace ourselves for what we know is to come. And soon enough Hawking trips visits the doctor and receives a chilling diagnosis He has perhaps two years to live. Jane marries him anyway and they make a life together. She is there for him day and night in sickness and in health even as Stephen becomes a black hole sucking in all of the energy and attention that strays into his vicinity. As the years pass and he gains greater renown Jane remains by his side managing house and home and her own muted desires.If Hawking didnt exist in real life a canny screenwriter might have invented him A sly physics genius who slacked his way through life until given a death sentence an atheist who wooed and won a devout Anglican co-ed as his wife a prisoner of his own body whose quicksilver mind let him transcend the heavens above He is a metaphor in waiting a real-life inspirational hero finally getting his Hollywood close-up. As Hawking Eddie Redmayne collapses slowly in the sort of transformation the Oscar voters love from a gawky Oxbridge scholar in oversized glasses into the familiar crumpled professor tapping away at the mouse of his rudimentary voice synthesizer. He and Felicity Joness Jane have a delicate authentic chemistry.If the film veers toward the mawkish on occasion it is also happy to take the piss out of Hawking At one point he and his buddies get drunk and they press him on how a man with motor neuron disease managed to be the biological father of three children. (Erections he explains are the province of an involuntary nervous system.)There are plenty of these moments and perhaps there is too much story to tell in one go so maybe Marsh can be forgiven for not knowing quite when to wrap up the proceedings The film seems about to conclude at least twice before it finally does. If he overplays the symbolism of time especially with a gratuitous reverse-time montage of the films highlights at the end you probably wont object too much Youll be too busy dabbing your eyes quietly astonished that you care this much about a theoretical physicist you barely knew.

The Theory of Everything Movie Review (2014) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-theory-of-everything-2014,200,thetheoryofeverything32,thetheoryofeverything,rogerebert
"Review The Theory of Everythings acting chemistry trumps physics - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Theory of Everything makes the cosmos of a marriage shine The Theory of Everything trailer Trailer for ""The Theory of Everything"" starring Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones Trailer for ""The Theory of Everything"" starring Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter Review The Theory of Everything is beautifully acted by Eddie Redmayne Felicity Jones The field that made scientist Stephen Hawking an international celebrity may be physics but the reason ""The Theory of Everything"" is emotionally effective as an examination of his life and thought comes down to chemistry the interconnected performances of Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones.Redmayne and Jones are beautifully compatible as Hawking and his then-wife Jane as they navigate the ebb and flow of 25 years of their relationship a subtle nuanced connection that posits that the complexities of the universe are nothing compared with the intricacies of the human heart. Hawkings public story surviving for half a century with a disease that was supposed to kill him within two years and going on to write the 10-million-copy-selling ""A Brief History of Time"" is a tale it would be impossible to make up.Oscars 2015 Full coverage But ""Theory of Everything"" screenwriter Anthony McCarten has smartly gone further. Working from Jane Hawkings memoir ""Travelling to Infinity My Life With Stephen"" hes expertly emphasized the personal side of the story which involves not only a marriage coping with the ravages of disease but also coming to terms with the kinds of interpersonal challenges neither of the partners expected when they married.

Eddie Redmayne and Benedict Cumberbatch discuss privacy in the modern world alongside Michael Keaton Robert Downey Jr. and Steve Carell in ""Hollywood Sessions."" See more videos Though hes not usually thought of as a dramatic filmmaker and risks becoming overshadowed by the justifiable praise that Redmaynes uncanny performance has been getting director James Marshs contribution here is considerable.Best known in this country for his documentary films including the Oscar-winning ""Man on Wire"" and ""Project Nim"" Marsh has done strong narrative work including one part of the too-little-seen ""Red Riding"" trilogy and the neglected ""Shadow Dancer.""A director with a natural gift for telling stories Marsh makes the most of McCartens effective script. Theres a real energy to his filmmaking the ability to be intelligently dramatic without overdoing things that is ideally suited to material that would be so easy to get wrong.

This clip goes over the question of Hawkings on set with the cast members director and producer. Perhaps because most peoples image of Hawking is of the gnome-like man with a computerized voice (its his trademarked one we hear in the film) and an electronic wheelchair ""Theory"" begins with the scientist as an exuberant English graduate student riding his bicycle hellbent for leather down the narrow streets of Cambridges university town in 1963.Hawkings brilliance as a cosmologist searching for ""one single unifying theory"" to solve the riddle of the universe is already apparent to his teachers but it cuts no ice with the women who attend a mixer with him and his friends. ""Oh dear -- scientists"" one of the young women says. ""We dont have to stay for long.""But when Jane Wilde and Hawking get a glimpse of each other something magical happens and one of the pleasures of ""Theory"" is how exactly it captures this awkward timid but unmistakable mutual attraction as it begins and flowers. The simple act of being likable on screen is no small matter and Redmayne and Jones absolutely get it right.Then a shadow falls on this Edenic situation as Hawking starts to experience difficulty with motion control. He is diagnosed with motor neuron disease a progressive nerve disorder that affects speaking walking breathing and swallowing. ""Your thoughts will not be affected"" a doctor tells him ""but no one will know what they are.""Beyond distraught Hawking doesnt even want to tell Jane the news but when she finds out she displays an unexpected fierceness. She insists that their life together will go on that they will be together for as long as they can. Hawking agrees and a wedding takes place with the groom leaning on a cane for support.Redmayne best known for his role on stage in ""Red"" and in film in ""Les Miserables"" gives a performance that is remarkable by any standard. The actor put in months of preparation working with movement and vocal coaches and visiting real MND patients and his ability to re-create numerous at times painful to watch stages of the disease is especially amazing when you realize the film was not shot in sequence.Helping considerably is having a performer as strong and subtle as Jones memorable in ""The Invisible Woman"" and ""Like Crazy"" to work off of in a scenario that charts a fraught and complicated relationship.While Hawkings scientific work especially his theories about the nature of black holes and the origins of the universe is given its due the focus here is always on the personal on the daunting complications this very unusual couple faced.Anyone who has read about the real story of the Hawkings marriage will be waiting for the appearance of two people who figure significantly in it choirmaster Jonathan Hellyer (Charlie Cox) and nurse/speech therapist Elaine Mason (Maxine Peake).Its typical of the largeness of spirit with which ""Theory of Everything"" has been made that no matter how challenging the relationships get no one here is depicted in a negative light. This is a dramatization that Hawking himself has called ""broadly true"" a story whose honesty we want to believe in. It is fortunate that it has the kind of exceptional cast that allows us to do just that.Twitter KennethTuran---------------------------------The Theory of EverythingMPAA rating PG-13 for some thematic elements and suggestive material.Running time 2 hours 3 minutesPlaying In limited release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Reviews Entertainment Felicity Jones The Theory of Everything Hollywood Sessions Robert Downey Jr. Eddie Redmayne on watching dailies For actor Eddie Redmayne a Stephen Hawking immersion course Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad83deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-theory-everything-review-20141107-column.html,200,thetheoryofeverything33,thetheoryofeverything,latimes
"The Theory of Everything including Cupid and Oscar review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Theory of Everything including Cupid and Oscar review James Marshs elegantly presented and Oscar-touted Stephen Hawking biopic The Theory of Everything is determined to string Cupids love bow and buff Oscars golden bod rather than win any kudos for scientific accuracy.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Nov. 6 2014The Theory of EverythingStarring Eddie Redmayne Felicity Jones Charlie Cox and David Thewlis. Directed by James Marsh. Opens Friday at the Varsity. 123 minutes. PGTheres not much science in the Stephen Hawking biopic The Theory of Everything despite a title that suggests some sort of omnibus training manual for people who habitually wear lab coats.Youve got to look elsewhere for that but even documentary film seems to avoid the egghead aspect of the acclaimed theoretical physicists incredible life journey. Last years doc Hawking The Remarkable Story of a Beautiful Mind covered even more personal ground (including the mans rather messy romantic life) than this one does making it seem at times more like a tabloid TV expose.Article Continued BelowNor would you want it any other way really. As Christopher Nolan demonstrates all too readily in another of this weeks prestige openers the sci-fi adventure Interstellar its very hard to make gripping cinema out of the mathematical equations and metaphysics that Hawking brought to the printed page in the global bestseller A Brief History of Time.Felicity Jones and Eddie Redmayne star as Jane and Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything.Theory director James Marsh is actually best known for his docs (he did the lauded Man on Wire and Project Nim) but here hes determined to string Cupids love bow and buff Oscars golden bod rather than win any kudos for scientific accuracy.He succeeds quite nicely on both counts. Marsh and screenwriter Anthony McCarten have chosen to elegantly adapt the memoir of ex-wife Jane Hawking whose Travelling to Infinity My Life With Stephen concerns itself mainly with the quarter century the two were together a union that produced three children and worldwide attention.Another pair is worthy of attention at this point Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones who play Stephen and Jane in the film. Its largely due to their sensitive and fully committed portrayals that Theory succeeds more than just in theory illuminating the love and friction of a couple tested by extraordinary circumstances. Especially Redmayne as he graphically demonstrates the advance of the motor neuron dysfunction known as Lou Gehrigs disease which seems to follows in lockstep with Hawking as he makes one celebrated advance after another in understanding the mysteries of black holes the universe and well everything. Among the Oscar nominations that The Theory of Everything will attract from Best Picture on down a Best Actor nod for Redmayne is the one absolute certainty.All of this is presented as a romantic nerds version of love and marriage beginning in 1963 when they were graduate students at Cambridge where he was studying cosmology and she was studying literature. Awkward Stephen courts refined Jane in scenes so golden captured by cinematographer Benoit Delhomme its as if they were dipped in honey. Despite Stephens agnostic doubts about ""the whole celestial dictator premise"" and Janes determination to live a Christian life (she quotes Genesis to him just before their first kiss) theyre soon dancing together on a bridge that may have been lit and decorated by angels.A fateful doctors visit yields a diagnosis that will change their lives Stephen is told (inaccurately as it turned out) that he has just two years left to live. He nobly urges Jane to abandon him because ""you dont know whats coming; it will affect everything."" She instead chooses to marry him and stand by his side as he increasingly becomes more famous and his body becomes more dependent on technological and human assistance.The rest of their story together is well known including the marital and life stresses that led Jane to choose another partner (a choir director played by Charlie Cox) and for Stephen to ultimately do the same.Its all covered in the film glossing over the seamier aspects of it (Stephens new marriage was a fractious one attracting both police and headlines).Marsh does offer up some telling moments including one where Stephen tries to assure Jane that theyre just a normal family and she counters by pointing out theyre anything but normal as the presence of 24/7 nurses and assistants attests.As for science well you get things like Stephens ""Eureka"" moment where hes looking through the holes of a sweater. He spots burning embers in a fireplace and suddenly concocts his theory of how black holes work.This is sheer poppycock of course but it makes for fine drama and thats all Cupid and Oscar care about.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

The Theory of Everything A stellar Eddie Redmayne unlocks the drive and desire of paralyzed genius Stephen Hawking Felicity Jones stars as Jane Wilde and Eddie Redmayne stars as Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything. Credit Liam Daniel/Focus By Peter Travers November 5 2014 More News The Best and Worst Movies of 2014 So Far Fall Movie Preview Finally the Good Stuff Pink Floyds The Endless River to Feature Stephen Hawking All Stories >> Blow past the notion that biopics about genius have to be stuffy pious by-the-book endurance tests. Not always. The Theory of Everything gives us the real breathing sweating bleeding world that British theoretical physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking calls his own. Challenged by a progressive neurological disease that robs him of movement and speech Hawking nonetheless carries on his mind racing to solve the mysteries of the universe. More News The Best and Worst Movies of 2014 So Far Fall Movie Preview Finally the Good Stuff Pink Floyds The Endless River to Feature Stephen Hawking All Stories >> I expected director James Marsh to cue the violins and hard-sell the triumph over adversity. Instead the emotionally charged surprisingly cheeky Theory of Everything gazes unflinchingly at the untidy ornery humanity of a thinking feeling sexual being caged by his own body. Hawking is a role that demands miracles of an actor. And Eddie Redmayne in a landmark performance delivers them. Hes matched by Felicity Jones who is simply sensational as Hawkings blunt determined wife Jane. Its Janes book Traveling to Infinity My Life With Stephen that serves as source material for the witty well-observed script by Anthony McCarten. Director Marsh whose 2008 documentary Man on Wire walked the tightrope with Philippe Petit takes to the high wire again by refusing to reduce Hawking to a saint martyred by symptoms related to ALS (Lou Gehrigs disease). Since Hawking wasnt born with this affliction Marsh and the skilled cinematographer Benoit Delhomme zap us back to 1963 with a whirling shot of Hawking - thick specs in place - biking around the Cambridge campus his head perpetually in the clouds until meeting pretty student Jane Wilde a poet and chorale singer with a belief in God that Hawking doesnt share. That sight alone will be a revelation to those stuck with the image of Hawking shackled to a motorized wheelchair his head lolling his muscles limp his voice computer-generated. For a start The Theory of Everything is a Big Bang Theory-ish romance between two young geeks bodies and minds colliding. And its exuberance is as bracing as it is unexpected. Hawking is just 21 when hes diagnosed and given two years to live. Its Jane who kicks him out of depression and into a marriage that will last 25 years and produce three children. When a friend asks Hawking how he gets it up for sex he cracks ""That part is automatic."" There is nothing automatic about the life Jane painstakingly builds for her husband as his condition deteriorates. Marsh is unsparing with the details. And Redmayne (Les Miserables) and Jones (Like Crazy) reach for the stars in two of the years best and most fearless acting feats. Its irksome that the film treads too lightly on the couples divorce partly resulting from Janes attraction (and later marriage) to her husbands caretaker Jonathan Hellyer Jones (the excellent Charlie Cox). Then theres Hawkings 1995 marriage and 2006 split from flinty nurse Elaine Mason (Maxine Peake). These are the few instances when the film feels reticent and removed. Otherwise The Theory of Everything referring to Hawkings dream of finding an equation to explain all existence is riveting science emotional provocation and one-of-a-kind love story all rolled into one triumphant film.

VPC Claudia Puig USA TODAY 1026 p.m. EST November 6 2014The film captures the early genius of Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) shown on his wedding day with Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones).(Photo Liam Daniel AP)Capturing the essence of genius is surely one of the toughest assignments a filmmaker or actor can undertake.In The Theory of Everything ( out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday in select cities) Eddie Redmayne does a superb job of bringing astrophysicist Stephen Hawking to life from his days as a college student through middle age. In framing the film in the context of the love story between Hawking and his first wife Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones) director James Marsh takes a complicated persona and reveals a range of dimensions. The result is an engaging biopic that is often quite moving.We meet Hawking at about age 20 when hes a cocky Cambridge student majoring in cosmology. His lofty goal is to find a ""simple eloquent explanation"" for the creation of the universe. When hes not working on his staggering assignment he dates fellow student Wilde whose area of specialty is languages and they quickly fall in love. Shortly thereafter Hawking is diagnosed with a motor neuron disease thats related to ALS. The doctors prognosis is that he wont have more than two years to live.Despite that grim prediction Hawking continues his physics studies as his speech and motor skills deteriorate. Almost as impressive as his tenacity is Janes unwavering commitment to this rumpled young man with the always-smudged eyeglasses. The couple are evenly matched in their determination to fight the odds and they marry in 1965 and have three children.A drama about Hawkings domestic life doesnt seem like an obvious choice for a director best known for Man on Wire a 2008 documentary about tightrope walker Philippe Petit. But Marshs look at the man behind the brain provides an intriguing and meticulous -- if a tad too reverential -- approach.Not only does Hawking live beyond his expected life span he goes on to a life of extraordinary accomplishments in quantum physics pursuing his now-famous theories of time.Though far less well known Jane tends to his needs with astonishing selflessness. While Stephen refuses to let disability define him Jane is the one who urges him to finish his doctorate.The film is involving nimbly acted and smartly directed though conventional in its narrative style. Whats lacking is a fuller portrait of Jane. While Jones communicates intelligence and warmth and has palpable chemistry with Redmayne her characters frustrations over setting her own career aside and the sorrow she endures as her husband grows away from her could have been more deeply explored.The film eventually shifts to include a third key character Jonathan (Charlie Cox) the director of a church choir in which Jane sings. She and Jonathan develop a close bond. Shortly thereafter Jane brings in a nurse to care for Stephen and their lives change. They divorce Stephen marries his nurse Elaine Mason (Maxine Peake) and Jane marries Jonathan.The film stops before Stephen turns 50 (hes now 72) and screenwriter Anthony McCarten seems to have chosen that as an arbitrary ending point. Why not go further with the story which is based on Janes memoir Travelling to Infinity My Life with Stephen?Nonetheless The Theory of Everything is inspiring as a tale of fighting a debilitating physical infirmity. Its also a compelling personal history thats not exactly brief but perhaps a bit limited in its scope. 58 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1u3YhK3",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/11/06/theory-of-everything-review/18101733/,200,thetheoryofeverything37,thetheoryofeverything,usatoday

It soon cuts to a spinning bicycle. Later as he hovers on the edge of a breakthrough it will stare at the cream spiraling in his teacup. Its a neat visual throughline but -- like the best movie images -- its more than just a way of bridging scenes. Its a metaphor for infinity itself -- for something which has no beginning no end just a constant unceasing circular movement. For time. Time is something that Stephen Hawking has wrestled with his entire life not least of all because he was told he had so little of it; he was still in his early 20s when he was diagnosed with a crippling motor-neuron disease and told he had two years to live. That was a half-century ago. And Hawking has filled those years with two marriages several children best-selling books -- and astonishing new theories on the nature of the universe. He is perhaps the most honored British scientist since Isaac Newton. And also as this moving and warmly affectionate film shows a very determined and very human man. ""The Theory of Everything"" was made with the cooperation of Hawking and his first wife Jane Wilde (and based on her book) so -- like all authorized bios -- some rough edges have been sanded down. Theres no sense of the rather imperious attitude that supposedly marked that marriage (and none of the discord that was said to mar his second). Nor does it try very hard to clearly explain his complicated theories (as Errol Morris fine documentary ""A Brief History of Time"" did so well). In fact the story -- unlike its subject -- is rather rooted in the here and now of daily life proceeding in a strictly linear fashion. (Its directors roots are in documentaries.) Yet if the movie has little interest in melodrama or modernist storytelling and less in theoretical physics it does have a keen fascination with the very best in people -- determination selflessness love. Felicity Jones as Hawkings first wife is very much the embodiment of all those virtues here. A genuinely devout woman she finds strength in her faith and puts that strength in the service of her children and her husband a man she views with endless love but not a shred of pity. Its a slightly restrained slightly too saintly performance -- it would be better if the character had a real moment or two of angry impatience or Jones aged a little more realistically over the course of some 20 years and three children -- but its a fine job nonetheless. And a perfect foil too to Eddie Redmaynes more exuberant work as Hawking. As a young man hes a revelation full of pranks and antic energy (with his shaggy early 60s hair and horn rims he even looks a little like a minor British pop star); as a progressively challenged older man hes the picture of unceasing courage. Limitless imagination too. Hawking is a man who gradually lost the use of his limbs then his voice; it seemed as if his brain would be imprisoned by his traitorous body. Yet instead his mind soared slipping past the surly bonds of earth to contemplate ""the mind of God."" Just as unrestrained is Redmaynes performance. If you know him only for a few period films (and his young-lover heartbreak in the recent ""Les Miserables"") his work here is a revelation a recreation of Hawkings troubles that goes beyond mimicry into real life. Comparisons to Daniel Day-Lewis Oscar-winning work in ""My Left Foot"" are inevitable -- and not undeserved. Nor is the praise this movie has been getting since its earliest festival screenings unwarranted. It is beautifully shot well acted and -- in the end -- tearfully inspiring. Because this is ultimately a film about defying gravity. And soaring. Ratings note The film contains some adult subject matter. THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING (PG-13) Focus (123 min.)

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet There is a howling Ken Russell-type Stephen Hawking biopic pent up inside The Theory Of Everything and it bursts out a la Alien during one of the movies final scenes in which the now middle-aged Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) who has zoned out in the middle of one of his own computer-delivered speeches sees an audience member drop a pen and rises out of his wheelchair to pick it up.By this point the viewer has already seen Hawking carried through the aisles of an opera house during a Wagner performance; watched him caress the fixtures of the room where Ernest Rutherford split the atom; listened to a doctor diagnose the young Hawking with motor neuron disease his face severely distorted by a fisheye lens; and heard choirmaster Jonathan (Charlie Cox) woo Hawkings first wife Jane (Felicity Jones) by miming along to Michael Nyman-esque figures at a church piano. However it takes Hawking getting out of his wheelchair--a sequence as tender as it is tasteless--for The Theory Of Everything to register as anything more than impersonal kitsch. It is the one ballsy moment in an otherwise thoroughly neutered movie.Based on Traveling To Infinity Jane Hawkings second softer biography of her ex-husband The Theory Of Everything covers Hawkings life from his first year as a doctoral student at Cambridge up until the late 1980s--in other words from right before his diagnosis through his rise to prominence as a physicist and pop-culture figure. The physics is reduced to some shots of Hawking shakily scrawling on a blackboard and a lecture that is intercut with a scene of his old grad-school buddies loudly explaining his ideas to each other in laymans terms; the rise of fame is conveyed through the usual shorthand of magazine covers. If nothing else The Theory Of Everything is an encyclopedia of lame shortcuts from its grainy faux home-movie wedding sequence to its tendency to fade out the dialogue in order to underline--and inadvertently undercut--a traumatic moment. Director James Marsh--best known for the Errol Morris Lite documentaries Man On Wire and Project Nim--has usually shown a knack for organizing information as well as an aptitude for understated suspense having directed the IRA thriller Shadow Dancer and the middle entry of the Red Riding trilogy. The Theory Of Everything however is a messy muddle equally over-stuffed and under-realized a collection of generically flat two-shots spiced up with the occasional useless flourish like the slow dolly-in on Hawkings bony back as he sits in a claw-foot tub. Cut out the cliches and what youre left with are two dilly-dallying love triangles--one involving the aforementioned Jonathan the other involving Elaine Mason (Maxine Peake) who would become Hawkings second wife--and Redmaynes technically accomplished impression of the physicist. Its only in a handful of scenes between the Hawkings--most notably the one where Jane visits Stephen for the first time after he loses the ability to speak--that the movie finds a pace purpose and romance of its own.

A little hope goes a long way. That talisman to live by has been the theme of countless movies about courage in the face of adversity but the message has never been advanced more movingly or brilliantly than in The Theory of Everything. This is the extraordinary biopic about the fascinating complex and inspirational example set by genius cosmologist and physicist Stephen Hawking who changed the future of the world from the paralyzing prison of a wheelchair. As the mathematical wunderkind who advanced a scientific theory beyond anyones imagination the great young actor Eddie Redmayne (My Week With Marilyn Les Miserables) gives the most electrifying performance of the year. THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING  (4/4 stars) Written by Anthony McCarten Directed by James Marsh Starring Felicity Jones Eddie Redmayne and Emily Watson Running time 123 min. In 1963 Stephen was an awkward shy and charmingly self-effacing 21-year-old student with an awesome brain but no social skills working on a Ph.D. in quantum physics at Cambridge when he met a pretty aggressive and determined fellow student Jane Wilde at a party and fell madly in love. One of the few girls who could engage his intellect in lively discussions of religion poetry and science she intrigued and captivated him completely. Then as the relationship gained intensity he was dealt a cruel blow. A small stumble led to tremors and a collapse on the pavement that shattered his glasses. With his entire future ahead of him Stephen was diagnosed with the progressive motor-neuron disorder A.L.S. (a.k.a. Lou Gehrigs Disease) and given a mere two years to live. Plummeting in a downward spiral of depression he cut off his friends loved ones and academic connections resigned to hopelessness and death. But Jane (played with a combination of tough grit and English rose garden sweetness by Felicity Jones) was having nothing to do with despair. She pursued him married him devoted her life to his survival and provided him with the wind beneath his broken wings. The marriage produced three children lasted 25 years and inspired Jane Wilde Hawkings best-selling memoir Travelling to Infinity My Life with Stephen upon which director James Marsh has based this film with a beautifully researched warts-and-all screenplay by Anthony McCarten that manages to let you in on the public heroism and private pain of a great scientist while making his theories user-friendly for any audience to understand and enjoy. Thankfully the theory of time and the origins of the universe are not the only accessible elements here. This is not a typical Hollywood love story about perfect people engaged in acts of perfect heroism. As Stephens crippling disability accelerates the marriage is marred by periods of doubt exhaustion and infidelity on both sides--Jane with her childrens male nanny the familys kindly choir director and her husbands devoted caregiver (Charlie Cox) Stephen with a speech therapist (Maxine Peake). But even after the divorce and Stephens second marriage they remain friends to this day. This is a great film in every sense. Superb direction frames every shot with perfect lighting and informed movement. The literate screenplay never makes a wrong move. The cast is uniformly excellent and craftsman-like and even though Mr. Redmaynes impeccable performance might effect a tear or two he also finds humor in the role. You will laugh and cry at the same time when he plays Stephen descending the stairs on his butt determined to get to the bottom one step at a time or bends his spoon so he can feed himself. Twisted like a pretzel and communicating with distorted challenges to his mouth lips and tongue his head cocked and hanging like a rag doll with a broken neck shoulders hunched fingers curled like twigs and feet pointed inward one can only imagine the physical damage to Mr. Redmaynes anatomy. But its amazing how he brings you into Stephens world until you feel hes an old friend. He defied the odds proved the existence of black holes in time and space and became something of a human miracle. Now at 72 with no plan to retire Stephen Hawking is still a living symbol of how much the brain can achieve when the body gives up--and Eddie Redmayne needs a chiropractor. When awards season rolls around he may also need someone to carry his Oscar.

Drama about physicist Stephen Hawking and his first wife. Director James Marsh (203). PG. Lincoln Square. Stephen Hawkings famous hypothesis about the universe is that to understand its beginning scientists must head backward in time -- and the universe gets smaller. Theres a similar approach in ""The Theory of Everything."" Rather than go for big ideas the movie cozies up to small wonders. Instead of an ah-ha moment we get a sigh of familiarity. Still in this biopic about Hawking theres one explosion that blows your mind Eddie Redmaynes performance. Redmayne as Hawking if the stars align should be an Oscar lock. Redmayne is first seen as Hawking in 1963 when the young English scientist is at Cambridge. At a dance he meets the lovely Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones). Shes demure hes soft-spoken but brash. Shes Church of England hes aiming to ""put God on the endangered species list."" But not long after Hawking experiences twitches spasms and falls that bring a diagnosis of Lou Gehrigs disease at age 21. Given two years to live Stephen marries Jane and pushes undeterred to get his doctorate in cosmology and physics. Though Hawkings amazing mind stays sharp his condition deteriorates though he and Jane raise three children throughout the 1970s. As his body becomes twisted and immobile his breakthrough scientific work continues while Jane develops feelings for her choir director Jonathan (Charlie Cox). The marriage becomes strained. Not long after Hawking writes his best seller ""A Brief History of Time"" he and Jane divorce. The film is based on Wildes memoir which hems in the story. Director James Marsh a documentarian whose terrific work includes ""Man on Wire"" and ""Project Nim"" wraps the Hawkings domesticity in gauze. The intensity that must have existed between his vibrant mind and her defiant spirit isnt felt. The movie seems to be leading up to moments when it could take left turns only to wind up exactly in the biopic zone we expect. The beautiful Jones seems limited in how deep she can burrow into Janes frustration and sorrow. But then anyone would be lost in Redmaynes wake. Known best to moviegoers from ""Les Miserables"" (2012) the young British actor captures the essence of Hawking now 72. In scenes set before Hawkings diagnosis Redmayne seems to be looking askance at the world examining it as it all moves past him. When his body rebels Redmaynes facial (and vocal) twists and turns approximating the worlds most famous physicist dare you to look away. ""Your thoughts will be unaffected by your disease but no one will know them"" a doctor says to Hawking early on. Redmayne conveys those thoughts in a turn thats absolutely amazing no matter what spins around him. jneumaiernydailynews.com Tags movies movie reviews the theory everything eddie redmayne felicity jones james marsh charlie cox Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

By David Denby Through a wormhole Matthew McConaughey leads a mission to another galaxy in Christopher Nolans ""Interstellar.""   Credit Illustration by Chris B. Murray ""Interstellar"" an outer-space survivalist epic created by the director Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan with whom he co-wrote the screenplay is ardently even fervently incomprehensible a movie designed to separate the civilians from the geeks with the geeks apparently the target audience. Nolans 2010 movie ""Inception"" offered layers of dreaming consciousness each outfitted with its own style of action. The film was stunning but meaningless--a postmodern machine with many moving parts dedicated to its own workings and little else. In ""Interstellar"" however Nolan goes for a master narrative. Like so many recent big movies ""Interstellar"" begins when the earth has had it. The amount of nitrogen in the air is increasing the oxygen is decreasing and after a worldwide crop failure dust storms coat the Midwest drying out the corn the only grain that is still growing. But all is not lost. God or Fortune or a Higher Intelligence (take your pick) has entered the game and has placed near Saturn a traversable wormhole a tunnel in space-time providing an expressway out of the galaxy and on to the countless stars and planets beyond. The commander of an underground nasa outpost Professor Brand (Michael Caine) sends a favored pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) on a mission Cooper and his crew including Brands daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway) are to retrace the flights of three astronauts who a decade earlier were sent to planets thought to be capable of sustaining human life. Are the explorers alive? What did they find? Can the earths billions be moved through the wormhole? As the crew members enter the distant passage with its altered space-time continuum they testily debate one another referring in passing to theories advanced by Albert Einstein Stephen Hawking and Kip Thorne. (Thorne a theoretical physicist and a longtime friend of Hawkings served as an adviser and an executive producer on the film.) Black holes relativity singularity the fifth dimension The talk is grand. Theres a problem however. Delivered in rushed colloquial style much of this fabulous arcana central to the plot is hard to understand and some of it is hard to hear. The composer Hans Zimmer produces monstrous swells of organ music that occasionally smother the words like lava. The actors seem overmatched by the production. Nolan who made the recent trilogy of night-city Batman movies must love the dark. In ""Interstellar"" he and the designer Nathan Crowley and the cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema send Coopers ship the Endurance hurtling through the star-dotted atmosphere or whirling past seething and shimmering clouds of intergalactic stuff. The basic color scheme of the space-travel segments is white and silver-gray on black and much of it is stirringly beautiful. Theres no doubting Nolans craft. Throughout ""Interstellar"" the camera remains active pursuing a truck across a cornfield or barrelling through sections of the Endurance. All this buffeting--in particular the crews rough-ride stress--is exciting from moment to moment but over all ""Interstellar"" a spectacular redundant puzzle a hundred and sixty-seven minutes long makes you feel virtuous for having sat through it rather than happy that you saw it. The Nolans provide a pair of querulous robots the more amusing of which is voiced by Bill Irwin but George Lucass boffo jokiness and Stanley Kubricks impish metaphysical wit live in a galaxy far far away. Cooper has two children back on Earth and like Leonardo DiCaprios Cobb in ""Inception"" he longs to return to his family. That leads to fights with Amelia who wants to journey on to the planet where her lover one of the astronauts on the earlier mission was sent in the hope of reuniting with him. McConaughey does his stylized hyper-relaxed drawl and Hathaway with short Ph.D. hair is crisp but also angry and passionate and the two stars clash with professional skill. Coopers side of the argument sets up the movies finest scene. After paying a quick visit to a planet in another galaxy the crew returns to the ship and discovers that on Earth more than twenty years has passed. Cooper watches video messages from his family including his daughter Murph who was a young girl when he left but has grown up to be Jessica Chastain. Through her tears she lashes out at him as only Jessica Chastain can lash out for leaving her. The Nolans take us into the farthest mysteries of space-time where they assure us love joins gravity as a force that operates across interstellar distances. The Earth may die but love will triumph. For all his dark scenarios Christopher Nolan turns out to be a softie. The belief that love as much as gravity holds galaxies together may have held some interest for Stephen Hawking but in a more attainable setting than on a planet beyond the Milky Way. ""The Theory of Everything"" tells the story of Hawking and his first wife Jane Wilde Hawking. The film begins in 1963 when Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) is a graduate student in cosmology at Cambridge University. At a party he meets Jane (Felicity Jones) who is studying ""arts"" as she says and they begin a charmingly awkward courtship in which she jollies him along as he confesses his modest desire to create ""one single unified equation that explains everything in the universe."" But an earlier scene in which he races a friend around a field shows something odd about his gait. It is the first sign of motor-neuron disease. As the illness progresses Hawking takes a bad fall in front of his residence hall after which he retreats to his room listening over and over to Wagners ""Die Walkure"" an opera in which goddesses ride stallions through the air. He is expected to live no more than two years but Jane tougher than a British Army officer marries him and keeps him going. The couple went on to have three children. In one scene a male friend at Cambridge carries Hawking up some stone steps and asks him ""Does your disease affect you know everything?"" Hawking who is still able to speak a little says ""Different system."" The film at its best doesnt mince words or scenes about Hawkings disability. Its also a revelatory portrait of his strength including his surprising gaiety the jokes and the ironies that he drew from God knows what reserves of energy. In this movie his illness and his productivity are intimately linked. The film is based on Jane Wilde Hawkings 2007 memoir ""Travelling to Infinity My Life with Stephen"" which the screenwriter Anthony McCarten and the director James Marsh have made into a physically detailed and touching but all in all rather conventional against-all-odds bio-pic. Some of the scenes are predictable The hero commits prodigious feats of casual English genius such as solving a difficult mathematical problem on the back of a railway timetable. He is wheeled before Cambridge dons and distinguished scientists many of whom are amazed that the shrunken man at the front of the room barely able to speak has a remarkable talent for theoretical speculation. (It isnt made clear though how Hawking does his calculations--his work cant be all speculation.) Eddie Redmaynes performance is astonishing as eloquent though in a different way as Daniel Day-Lewiss work in ""My Left Foot."" Day-Lewis playing the Irish artist Christy Brown a man whose mobility is reduced to a single limb deployed his left foot a bushy black beard and minimal mangled speech to create a ferociously willful and sexually miserable man. Redmayne is a gentler actor; he was the noble youth in ""Les Miserables"" who sang in a fine light tenor the tear-stained but upbeat ""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables."" Tall and slender with freckles and a flattened upper lip he wears his brown hair in a heavy mop that in this film falls across his forehead to meet enormous black-framed glasses. With his narrow shoulders he initially looks like an abashed scarecrow. Redmayne uses his eyebrows his mouth a few facial muscles and the fingers of one hand to suggest not only Hawkings intellect and his humor but also the calculating vanity of a great man entirely conscious of his effect on the world. Hawking doesnt discover a unified equation but he settles for black holes and a comprehensive and remarkably lucrative obsession with time. (""A Brief History of Time"" has sold more than ten million copies worldwide.) The movie is a love story and a success story ending with Hawkings refusal of a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth for reasons that arent explained. His relationships with women in general here are baffling. Were puzzled by the black hole in his character that causes him after twenty-five years of loving marriage to leave the devoted accomplished and beautiful Jane for a young nurse (Maxine Peake) who treats him like a baby and dominates him. After one brief outburst Jane doesnt protest but happily escapes into the arms of a strapping but gentle choirmaster (Charlie Cox). So we have to do a little speculating ourselves Did Jane want to get out of the marriage? Or did she suppress an entirely understandable rage in order to keep the portrait of the marriage as pleasant (and salable) as possible? ""The Theory of Everything"" makes a pass at the complexities of love but whats onscreen requires a bit more investigation.

Hawking a great wit has always seen the dark humor in his bodily predicament the ALS-like disease that began robbing the intellectual explorer of his muscular function as early as his university years. The Theory of Everything embraces that irony This is a Hawking profile in which youll see the wheelchair-bound speech-impaired scientist happily rolling around his living room dressed up like a Dalek from Doctor Who his children squealing. More substantially its a movie that delivers science in an approachable Neil deGrasse Tyson-like way one that might turn young people onto big theoretical ideas--as well as turn them onto the enjoyment of problem solving with the right partner. An early scene has a thoughtful professor introducing ruffled Cambridge student Stephen (Eddie Redmayne) to a lab where all the action happens; its a lovely moment of quiet inspiration. The film is filled with snazzy visual metaphors A swirling cup of coffee becomes a symbol for dark and light matter. A formal dance where Stephen twirls with the future love of his life Jane (Felicity Jones) twinkles with glowing lights and a hint of the universe falling into place. The film is their story (the script is largely based on the second of Jane Hawkings two memoirs) and even though it smooths out some of their domestic unease and eventual divorce theres still a pronounced strain just below the surface from playful sparring over religion to the tougher difficulties of back-burnered ambitions. Both performers are extraordinary imbued with confidence in complex roles and while Redmayne has more physical mannerisms to master Jones burns hotter as a strong woman who cant forget her own needs.

Every marriage or long-term partnership is knowable only to the people inside it -- and sometimes not even then. The Theory of Everything tells the story of genius theoretical physicist Stephen Hawkings marriage to the former Jane Wilde though of course it can tell that story only from the outside. But the film is striking at times even piercing for the way it infiltrates some universal realities of marriage. If the secrets of making marriage work were a science then geniuses might be able to help us through it. As it is even brainiacs like Stephen Hawking have to muddle through like the rest of us. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Hawking was diagnosed with a serious motor neuron disease in his early twenties a condition that began attacking his motor capabilities and fairly quickly put him in a wheelchair. But The Theory of Everything -- which is based on Jane Hawkings memoir and directed by James Marsh who gave us the Philippe Petit documentary Man on Wire -- begins in 1963 before any of that happens. Stephen (Eddie Redmayne) is still a cosmology student at Cambridge a shy shambling soft-spoken nerd-babe sexy in an E=mc2 way. His walk is a kind of bent-forward slouch but you wouldnt attribute that to any lurking physical ailment. He seems simply to be always racing forward in his thoughts. Its only natural his body should try to follow.You can see why fellow student Jane (Felicity Jones) well-bred well-mannered and pot-of-cream pretty would be attracted to him. The two meet at a party and at first Hawking cant muster the momentum to get a relationship going. Hes wasting valuable time though he doesnt yet know just how valuable. Not long after the two finally get together Stephen stumbles and lands unconscious on the pavement at school. A doctor figures out what the problem is informing Stephen he has only about two years to live. Jane decides that she wants to make a life with him anyway; the two marry and begin having babies. We see Stephen holding his first child a daughter as an infant. Holding babies two and three will become more difficult as his motor capabilities deteriorate but he manages anyway -- at every stage Stephen as Redmayne plays him radiates the joy of being in such close proximity to a tiny new being.Film DetailsCritics Pick The Theory of Everything RatingPG-13 GenreDrama Running Time123 More Info Trailer Through all of it of course Stephen is spinning out one brilliant theory after another; the coconut on his hunched shoulders is formidable. His fame grows but the strain of looking after him -- while also raising three children -- begins to wear on Jane. She says she needs outside help; Stephen resists it. A third party a music teacher named Jonathan Hellyer Jones (Charlie Cox) enters their circumscribed world complicating it. Then a hired nurse Elaine Mason (Maxine Peake) complicates it more. A marriage can hold only two people but putting up barricades against the outside world is impossible.The Theory of Everything may slightly sanitize the truth of Jane and Stephen whatever that is This is after all a story told from the point of view of an ex-wife. (Hawking now 72 -- having surpassed his original death sentence by some 50 years -- is said to have deemed the movies depiction ""broadly true."") And the film is as polished as a piece of fine walnut furniture -- in spirit and approach it very closely resembles The Kings Speech. Some will see that as a bad thing but neatly constructed heartfelt triumph-over-adversity pictures have their place. This one is particularly sly in the way it folds complex and sometimes painful ideas about love and commitment into a somewhat glossy package. Though its never dour it doesnt bleed heavily into feel-good territory either.What makes the picture so believable is its unspoken insistence that friendship not romance is the backbone of marriage. As their union begins to crumble -- in fact after it has fallen apart -- Jane shows her bruised disappointment when Stephen no longer comes to her first with some bit of happy news. But the next minute she laughs easily at one of his wry jokes unable to shut herself off from the core of whatever she loved about him in the first place.Marsh could be criticized for going too light on the science You wont learn much about Hawkings professional achievements here. But the movie suggests that not even Hawking who considers himself an atheist is immune to wonder. In a lovely scene young Stephen and Jane attend a university dance and he explains why the mens laundered-and-pressed white shirts glow more brightly than the girls white dresses under the UV light. ""Tide washing powder"" he says and his explication delights her. But in the movies terms the ""why"" doesnt make the ""what"" any less magical Marsh and cinematographer Benoit Delhomme show us a sea of dancers nearly invisible in the glittering dark but for their radioactive-looking shirtfronts and elbow-length gloves happy young people doing double duty as night-lights.Both Jones and Redmayne are marvelous as two strong perceptive people locked in a frustrating pas de deux. Jones is almost childlike in her early scenes; you cant believe her Jane small as a wintertime bird will have the strength to help Stephen into and out of his wheelchair. But by the end of the film -- and by the inevitable end of the marriage -- Jones ever alert and intent makes you believe Jane is capable of anything almost to her detriment. She takes on so much that she nearly wears herself out -- Jones makes you see the strain thread by fraying thread.Redmaynes job is even trickier but he pulls it off beautifully. We all know what Hawking looks like When we think of him we see a man scrunched in a wheelchair often sporting a wicked skewed smile and equally skewed glasses. The wheelchair is of course a significant feature. So how does an actor play the person and not the infirmity? Redmayne succeeds without succumbing to mere impersonation. In an early scene right after Stephen has received his diagnosis we see him surveying his hands -- his fingers forming a gnarled claw -- as if they were no longer his own. Later Stephen can barely move those hands at all. But Redmayne makes it clear that Hawkings mind is always alive with movement. Were so intent on watching him that the wheelchair recedes to the point where it practically disappears. All we see is a man one with a crooked Cheshire Cat grin proving that physicality is all in the mind.1 Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Stephanie Zacharek Follow szacharek Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

With Toronto Jeff Sneider Reviews Nightcrawler The Cobbler Good Kill (Video) Watch Anna Kendrick and Jeremy Jordan Sing While Driving Recklessly in The Last Five Years (Video) Jason Reitmans Men Women and Children - Human Problems Minus Real Live Humans Toronto 2014 The stars give explosive life to the fascinating complex life of Stephen Hawking Stephen Hawking is part of an elite group in human history one of those people who has led us to perceive our universe in new and different ways throwing out old suppositions and embracing exciting uncharted realities. His innovations and refusal to subscribe to outdated modes of thinking merely underscore the utter conventionality of his film biography ""The Theory of Everything."" Screenwriter Anthony McCarten (adapting Jane Hawkings memoir ""Travelling to Infinity My Life with Stephen"") and director James Marsh (""Shadow Dancer"") successfully explain the finer points of quantum physics and the origins of the universe in an audience-friendly way but they also make the courtship marriage and travails of the Hawkings feel standard-issue even when their actual lives were anything but. See video Eddie Redmayne Channels Genius With Felicity Jones in Touching Theory of Everything Trailer (Video) One would think this was a generic British World War II drama what with all the brave women holding chins aloft as their eyes fill up with tears and Johann Johannssons score periodically welling up triumphantly in a manner that suggests that the film is patting itself on the back. When we first encounter Stephen (Eddie Redmayne) in the early 60s hes a slightly awkward but thoroughly brilliant graduate student; upon meeting Jane (Felicity Jones) at a party he informs her that his goal is to create one unifying theory that will explain all the forces of the universe. They make a wonderfully mismatched couple -- hes an atheist scientist shes a devout Anglican pursuing a PhD in medieval poetry -- and their chemistry pops even before Marsh surrounds them with twinkly lights and fireworks at a school dance. (During that event Stephen regales Jane with a scientific discussion about white shirts Tide detergent and the birth and death of stars that plays as both genuinely nerdy and thoroughly romantic.) When he is diagnosed with motor neuron disease at the age of 21 and given just two more years to live Stephen tries to drive Jane away but shes too strong for that devotedly staying by his side and marrying him. His condition slowly deteriorates allowing Redmayne to do the kind of external performance that sends awards-giving bodies into a tizzy. And while his fame in the world of science grows Jane finds herself (and her academic ambitions) worn out by the duties of taking care of not only her debilitated husband but also their three children. The film is not without humor after Hawking loses the power of speech and gets his famous talking computer Jane notes with surprise that it makes him sound American and subsequent scenes feature Hawking trying out famous lines from ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" and ""Doctor Who"" in his new mechanical ""voice."" Also read Stephen Hawking Film Theory of Everything Causes a Big Bang in Toronto Even without all the facial and bodily contortions that the character demands Redmayne gives a thoroughly captivating performance; he presents Hawking at all stages of his life as the kind of person whose brain never stops working. Even when betrayed by his own body Hawkings mind races onward and you can see it in the glint in Redmaynes eyes. Jones so often cast as the wispy ingenue reveals a real strength here playing a character whos not merely reactive but takes full control over her own life and that of her family. The films feelings about Janes ambitions and duties often seem muddled -- her mother (played by Emily Watson) doesnt recommend a nurse or nanny to relieve Janes stress but rather a stint in the church choir -- but at least theres an acknowledgment that Stephens accomplishments probably wouldnt have happened without Janes tireless devotion. Also read Torontos First Weekend Features Some Fireworks But Were Waiting for Greatness If ""The Theory of Everything"" breaks the mold a bit its in the acknowledgment that even the greatest love stories have the occasional bump in the road as each Hawking enjoys an extra-marital flirtation -- her with a kindly choir director and occasional caregiver (Charlie Cox) and him with a saucy speech therapist (Maxine Peake). Thats about the only deviation from the standard formula that this movie can offer; otherwise we get ""forward-thinking man of science"" crossed with ""great man bravely endures physical infirmity"" from start to finish. Its ""Everything"" youve seen in other movies and that you would have predicted youd see in this one. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Photo Focus Features MOVIE REVIEW The Theory of Everything Running time 123 minutes. Rated PG-13 (suggestiveness). At the Lincoln Square and the Union Square. In the sublime ""The Theory of Everything British actor Eddie Redmayne knocks it straight out of the universe as Stephen Hawking the most famous physicist since Albert Einstein -- and the best-known celebrity disabled by a progressive neurological disease since Lou Gehrig. Its a tremendously moving and inspirational look at Hawking that centers on the cosmological genius unconventional marriage to his first wife Jane -- a superb Felicity Jones -- a graduate student majoring in poetry who met and fell in love with Hawking when he was a fully mobile and very promising student at Cambridge University in 1963. A serious fall leads to a diagnosis of ALS -- and a doctors devastating prognosis that Hawking then 21 would be dead within two years as muscles throughout his body rapidly deteriorated. Of course its well known that Hawking is still around at 72 -- long ago having published his best-selling masterwork ""A Brief History of Time detailing his ground-breaking theories about time black holes and the universe (theories that fuel this weeks ""Interstellar""). Felicity Jones and Eddie Redmayne in ""The Theory of Everything""Photo Focus Features Despite being long confined to a wheelchair and using a computer with a voice synthesizer to communicate Hawking is a huge international celebrity whos appeared in everything from documentaries to TVs ""The Simpsons and ""The Big Bang Theory. James Marsh who directed the Oscar-winning doc ""Man on Wire sensitively reveals the less familiar story -- sensitively adapted by Anthony McCarten from a memoir by Jane Hawking -- of how Jane patiently coaxed the man she loved out of deep depression after his diagnosis. They married and raised three children their relationship constantly tested by the terrible progression of his disability which ravages and twists his body but not his brilliant mind. ""The Theory of Everything and Redmaynes exquisitely detailed performance (which also beautifully captures the mans mordant wit) takes great pains to detail how Hawking gradually loses all but the slightest mobility. Eddie Redmayne in ""The Theory of Everything""Photo Focus Features The film remarkably doesnt shy from depicting the huge burdens it loads on Jane as his caregiver. But this remarkable woman never gives up refusing to take Hawking off life support when hes comatose with pneumonia (which leads to him losing his voice -- by now barely understandable -- altogether). All of this places unimaginable strains on their 30-year marriage during which Jane falls in love with choir director Jonathan Hellyer Jones (Charlie Cox). In an unusual arrangement that provokes gossip -- and makes Hawkings father (Simon McBurney) and Jane mothers (Emily Watson) uneasy -- Jones becomes a member of the family with Hawkings blessing. An internationally acclaimed Hawking eventually separates from Jane after he grows close to one of his nurses (played briefly in the film by Maxine Peake) to whom he was married from 1995 to 2006; Jane goes on to marry Jones. Visually imaginative ""The Theory of Everything is an unusually compelling true-life story about an extraordinary couple triumphing over adversity. Its my favorite movie so far this year and I wouldnt be at all surprised if it ended up sweeping the Oscars. Dont miss it.

In the mawkish biopic ""The Theory of Everything"" that tragic development overshadows his real achievements in a formulaic tearjerker that nevertheless delivers on its narrow focus. Featuring Eddie Redmayne in an impressive performance that finds the actor credibly transforming into the wheelchair-bound figure known to the masses the movie focuses on Hawkings struggle to remain active with the tender support of his loving wife Jane (Felicity Jones). The travails of their relationship absolutely resonate. However unlike Errol Morris 1991 documentary ""A Brief History of Time"" which blends the narrative of Hawkings life with his groundbreaking ideas on cosmology James Marshs elegant period drama relegates the theories to the sidelines for a more traditional look at perseverance. Its a strange decision by Marsh a documentarian himself whose previous credits (including the Oscar-winning ""Man on Wire"") suggests he could have developed a thrilling look at Hawkings ability to comprehend the nature of the universe. But ""The Theory of Everything"" still lands its poignancy through the sheer effectiveness of its performances and the environment that props them up. Shot in lush colors by cinematographer Benoit Delhomme (""A Most Wanted Man"") the movie begins during Hawkings early days as a Cambridge doctorate student and chronicles his diminishing physical abilities as he continues to develop the principles for ""A Brief History of Time."" It doesnt take long for Hawking and his lover to meet cute on campus and when hes diagnosed with two years to live Janes willingness to stand by his side plays out in standard melodramatic fashion but Jones gives the character a subtle edge. The actress has previously displayed an ability to appear both fragile and powerfully committed in ""The Invisible Woman"" and ""Like Crazy"" but her role as Jane marks the pinnacle of her abilities for the subtle means she conveys her affection for Hawking even as the couple face insurmountable events that challenge their future. In the meantime ""The Theory of Everything"" tracks the growth of the Hawking family the physicists plight as he learns to communicate in new ways and the support they receive from longtime friend Jonathan Hellyer Jones (Charlie Cox) whose burgeoning attraction to Jane threatens to complicate the scenario. But the movie still works best when it hints at Hawkings mathematical instincts and its tensions with his wifes spiritual convictions. ""What one believes is irrelevant to physics"" he says but the exact meaning of that declaration never receives the clarity it deserves. Nevertheless Marsh succeeds at evoking Hawkings frustrations with a keen cinematic approach at one point outlining his envy of his healthier colleagues by dropping the audio and showing Hawkings perspective of the more physically capable people around him. Redmayne who manages to look incredibly similar to the real-life subject eventually must convey a depth of emotion with the subtle movements of raised eyebrows and a focused gaze. Its an impressive turn particularly as Jane strives to help the man learn to translate his thoughts into words while they both start to question the nature of their bond. The story builds to a celebratory finale that anyone remotely familiar with Hawkings perseverance would expect but only truly acknowledges the cosmic nature of his ideas in the closing credits. No matter how much ""The Theory of Everything"" showcases the incredible process through which Hawking maintains a connection to the rest of the world it falls short of burrowing inside his head. Grade B- ""The Theory of Everything"" premiered this week at the Toronto International Film Festival. Focus Features will release it in November.

Reply ernest May 12 2016 1102 am The reviewer is right the movie exploits the fame of Hawkins without giving credit to the reasons for it. Reply rolland May 12 2016 1102 am Jane makes a point in her book that her admiration and love Steve was based in part to his scientific accomplishments and because of its ability to express them in understandable terms Reply gold May 12 2016 1102 am Red is totally right. Dont expect to get a very in depth look at Hawkings theories itself. This is based on Janes point of view written by Jane herself. Reply Daniel23 May 12 2016 1102 am The film-makers deliberately chose Janes book in order to make this a more broadly accessible love story. Emotions sell science doesnt. Reply Red May 12 2016 1102 am You may have missed this film was based on a book by Hawkins ex-wife about their love affair ""TRAVELLING TO INFINITY MY LIFE WITH STEPHEN - JANE HAWKING"". Its doubtful she would have included in depth reviews of his scientific achievements given she was a Medieval Studies major.

The intricate workings of a rare and remarkable mind are rendered in simple accessible terms in ""The Theory of Everything"" a sensitively directed inspirational biopic centered around the great British physicist Stephen Hawking and his mind-over-body struggle with motor neuron disease. Striving to pay equal tribute to Hawkings first wife Jane (on whose memoir the film is based) and her tireless devotion to him until their 25-year marriage ended in 1995 director James Marsh similarly attempts to find intimate personal applications for Hawkings grand cosmic inquiries tracing the story of how the author of ""A Brief History of Time"" came to defy time itself. Still whats onscreen is less a cerebral experience than a stirring and bittersweet love story inflected with tasteful good humor that cant help but recall earlier disability dramas like ""My Left Foot"" and ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly."" Superb performances from Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones should stand the Focus Features release in good critical and commercial stead when it bows Nov. 7 Stateside. A brief prologue at Buckingham Palace quickly dissolves in rather on-the-nose fashion from a slowly rolling wheelchair to a fast-spinning bicycle as young Stephen (Redmayne) joyfully races a friend through the streets of Cambridge in 1963. A skinny rumpled-looking fellow who peers out from behind perpetually dirty thick-rimmed glasses Stephen is a brilliant graduate student in cosmology and already deeply fascinated by time the origins of the universe and other theoretical concepts that will occupy much of his later writing and research. But even as his intellectual prowess knows no limits his physical vigor soon abandons him as foreshadowed early on when he idly knocks over a cup of tea. At around the half-hour mark his head hits the pavement with a sickening crack at which point Stephen learns he has MND a disease related to ALS that will gradually shut down all muscular control and that he will live for only two years at most. Unwilling to accept this grim diagnosis however is Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones) whom Stephen immediately falls in love with and marries -- never mind that as a student of foreign languages and poetry as well as a devout member of the Church of England she represents in many ways his intellectual and philosophical opposite. (Debating Jane on the existence of God Stephen notes that he has ""a slight problem with the whole celestial-dictator premise"" one of many wry witticisms that pepper Anthony McCartens literate script.) But their differing systems of belief (she has one he doesnt) turn out to be a unifying principle rather than a divisive one and indeed one of the films most bracing thematic motifs is Hawkings refusal to lock himself into rigidly predetermined conclusions his openness to reversing and contradicting his own monumental work in pursuit of ever higher and deeper forms of knowledge. Jane is bravely determined to help her husband fight his debilitating illness and enjoy however many years they have together which happily turn out to be far more than expected (Hawking is now 72). Yet Marsh takes pains to convey the heavy burden of Stephens physical decline in every grueling particular and Redmaynes performance nails all the outward manifestations without unnecessary exaggeration the contorted wrist the drooping head the stooped posture the inward-pointing toes the reliance on crutches and wheelchair and the increasingly unintelligible speech that ultimately led Hawking to use a speech-generating device. Redmayne palpably conveys the mans frustration and humiliation at each fresh deprivation from his inability to transfer food from plate to mouth to his difficulty holding and playing with his children (Stephen and Jane have three kids the disease having mercifully not interfered with every key bodily function). Looking after this particular family of course is a full-time job that takes an enormous toll on Jane whom Jones invests with warmth spirit and a determination motivated as much by her characters religious faith as by her love for Stephen. One of the more refreshing aspects of ""The Theory of Everything"" is the way it acknowledges what it really means to be long-suffering wife that regular yet often strictly decorative fixture of far too many great-man Hollywood biopics. In Janes case that means fending off nasty rumors and her own undeniable temptations when her church choirmaster a handsome and sensitive widower named Jonathan Hellyer Jones (a fine Charlie Cox) becomes a close family friend informal caretaker to Stephen and rowdy father figure to the kids. The later passages are replete with sniffle-inducing sentiments underplayed marital tensions and no shortage of amusing jokes drawing on Stephens seemingly bottomless reserves of self-deprecating humor. Eventually the story arrives at the painful matter of the couples divorce in scenes that feel somewhat truncated and show clear signs of genteel narrative airbrushing Understandably the filmmakers chose to adapt not Jane Hawkings angry and controversial 1999 tell-all ""Music to Move the Stars"" but rather her more tempered and forgiving 2008 follow-up ""Traveling to Infinity My Life With Stephen"" and their sympathies feel more or less evenly divided between two individuals who remain friends even after the end of their marriage. Its worth noting that ""The Theory of Everything"" derives its title from Hawkings tireless search for a single universal equation that will account for all existence reconciling quantum mechanics and Einsteins general relativity; dramatically speaking the filmmakers seem to have incorporated that principle by extending a generous spirit of inclusion toward nearly everyone onscreen. Admittedly they cant resist aiming a few bitchy jabs at Elaine Mason (Maxine Peake) the protective and strong-willed nurse whom Stephen married in 1995 (and whom he divorced in 2006) but even she comes off as well as she could under the circumstances. Elsewhere McCartens script offers a clipped overview of Hawkings achievements while keeping the scientific and mathematical discourse at a level that laypeople in the audience will readily comprehend employing such figures as Cambridge professor and leading cosmologist Dennis Sciama (David Thewlis) to tease out Hawkings head-spinning notions about black holes space-time singularities and the boundaries of the universe. Elsewhere the film resorts to effective if elementary visual associations A cheerfully blazing fire neatly serves up the second law of thermodynamics while the sight of Stephen and Jane twirling beside the river Cam playfully and romantically underscores the reversibility of time. Marsh has proven himself an expert stylist in his dramatic features (""Shadow Dancer"" his chapter of the ""Red Riding"" trilogy) as well as his documentaries (""Man on Wire"" ""Project Nim"") and he works with d.p. Benoit Delhomme to lend this film a richness of color and texture that keep any sense of British period-piece mustiness at bay. The effect is heightened by Johann Johanssons score whose arpeggio-like repetitions and progressions at times evoke the compositions of Philip Glass working in concert with Jinx Godfreys swiftly edited montages to lyrical and emotionally extravagant effect. John Paul Kellys production design Steven Nobles costumes (entailing 77 wardrobe changes to complete Redmaynes disheveled-academic look) and well-chosen Cambridge locations uphold the films high production standards across the board. Amid the fine supporting cast Simon McBurney and Emily Watson make welcome too-brief appearances as Stephens father and Janes mother respectively both of whom get at least one scene in which to dole out loving sensible advice.

Where there is life there is hope."" What sticks out about the scene is not the sentiment itself so much but the fact that the rest of the film its in manages mostly to avoid such saccharine cliches. A biopic portrait of the marriage between theoretical physicist Hawking and Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones The Invisible Woman) The Theory of Everything is a solid duly moving account of their complicated relationship spanning roughly 25 years and made with impeccable professional polish. However if the syrupy lows are blessedly few and far between the highs are not much more frequent. As such its something of a disappointment for fans of James Marsh director of such excellent documentaries as Man on Wire and Project Nim and the features Shadow Dancer The King and one third of the Red Riding trilogy. Given the stars are relative newcomers distributors will need to work hard to exploit awareness of Hawking and boost the films triumph-over-adversity message to gain traction with audiences and awards bodies over the coming months. Its unlikely to generate the same high profile as say A Beautiful Mind another notable biopic about a scientist with a disability and a long-suffering wife. Based on the memoir written by Jane Hawking nee Wilde Travelling to Infinity My Life with Stephen and adapted by novelist-screenwriter Anthony McCarten (Death of a Superhero) the script feels at pains to be fair to and honor its still-living subjects. Hawking has achieved an unlikely-seeming international celebrity (hes even cameoed on The Simpsons) after writing the science-for-laymen bestseller A Brief History of Time which explains his theories of cosmology and the titular Theory of Everything a still incomplete mathematical framework that attempts to reconcile quantum physics and Einsteins theory of relativity. Proceeding in doggedly linear chronological fashion the action starts in 1963 when Hawking had just begun his Ph.D at Cambridge University. (Locations around the actual town are used in abundance adding authenticity.) At a party he meets Jane a major in Romance Languages and Literature and soon the two are batting eyes at one another as they politely discuss religion science and poetry. The courtship gathers pace while Hawking continues to impress his tutor Dennis Sciama (David Thewlis) with his mathematical insight. However gradually what superficially seems like gawky clumsiness - spilling cups falling down in the quad - turns out to be evidence of motor neuron disease a condition related to the ice-bucket-challenge-prompting illness ALS. A doctor (Adam Godley) tells Hawking he probably has no more than two years to live and he goes into an understandable spiral of despair. But Jane who has resources of grit that might not be immediately apparent under her polite English-rose persona refuses to walk away and soon the two are married and starting a family. The core story poses a number of tricky challenges for the filmmakers how to do justice to Hawkings scientific achievements without turning it into an illustrated lecture or lots of shots of him writing things on a blackboard with a furrowed brow; how to balance that material with drama about the marriage especially since Stephens disability makes it increasingly hard for him to communicate putting a greater burden on Jane to carry the narrative; and most importantly how to make the ultimate dissolution of their marriage not feel like a major downer. Its to Marsh and his collaborators credit that the film meets those challenges as well as it does. The science bit gets somewhat slighting treatment but in truth its almost impossible stuff to summarize in the first place and the use of some stylized visuals of an eye in extreme close up and a few visual effects do well enough to stand for Hawkings big inspiration about black holes and the origins of the universe. In fact eyes make for a compelling leitmotiv throughout especially when Hawking can only communicate with glances and blinks. The texture of academic life is beautifully evoked and it says a lot for the movie that arguably its most moving moment is the scene where Hawking passes the oral exam (or viva) for his Ph.D. As his disability increases the focus shifts more to Jane and how she faces the challenges of caring for Stephen while she gradually falling in love with choirmaster Jonathan Hellyer Jones (Charlie Cox) a sweet subplot thats also told through significant glances and shimmering pseudo-Super 8 montage sequences that show the evolution of this emotional menage a trois. Facing the physical challenges of depicting Hawkings disability Redmayne pulls it off with enormous grace and endurance and its not just the assist from prosthetic teeth and ears that helps him create an impeccable mimicry of the real man. Jones almost has the harder part in a way even though she doesnt have to play someone with a physical handicap and she holds her own well although the aging makeup and costumes are less persuasive in the final stretch. Ace cinematographer Benoit Delhommes lush intricately lit compositions add a splendor that keeps the film consistently watchable even in the slower stretches. Composer Johann Johannsson piano-based score has a dainty precision with a ineffable scientific quality about it as befits someone who once composed an album called IBM 1401 A Users Manual.
