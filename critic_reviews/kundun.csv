The landscape with its arched snowy peaks and palaces etched into the earth is almost lunar in its crystalline aridity and Scorsese does eerie justice to the forbidding beauty of it all. What the movie doesnt have is visual flow. The images are hermetic almost literally pieced together; its hard to forget that youre watching officially splendid cinematography. Kundun is at once spectacular and inert--a mosaic impersonating a movie. As the story progresses from the 30s through the 50s with the Dalai Lama played by one actor then another then another still were denied a sense of how his temperament as an individual played against the demands of his pedestal. The great achievement of Scorseses The Last Temptation of Christ was the way it dramatized Jesus as man and deity. The director grasped the startling theatrical conflict in that duality. But Scorsese lost in an outsiders empathy for Tibet and its struggles never gets close to the conflict at the heart of Buddhism--the acknowledgement that life is ""suffering"" because its sensual demands cant be truly fulfilled. Theres precious little sensuality in Kundun. Like Bertoluccis The Last Emperor (also the vision of an Italian Catholic) its an empty-shell epic a Western sinners pious ode to the decorousness of Eastern mysticism. Tenzin Thuthob Tsarong who plays the Dalai Lama as an adult is as cold and impassive as a Harvard preppie--he doesnt show a trace of the real Dalai Lamas sneaky joy--and when he finally meets Mao Zedong (Robert Lin) the dictator who is seeking to destroy his country the supreme mass murderer of the 20th century just seems an effete clown. Scorsese has taken the harsh mystery out of Tibetan Buddhism and out of its oppression too.

But pic is bogged down by a routine screenplay that fails to provide a fresh perspective on Tibets nonviolent culture. Immensely aided by Philip Glass emotionally powerful score Scorsese utilizes an innovative style that deviates substantially from mainstream narrative cinema in general and the Hollywood biopic genre in particular. The combination of a serious demanding subject a cast composed mostly of Tibetan nonprofessional actors and the lack of an involving dramatic structure should spell box office disappointment for a singular film thats likely to divide both critics and audiences. The controversy surrounding the production of ""Kundun"" will not help the film in the way that Scorseses ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" (1988) became a cause celebre when it was attacked by fundamentalists. Though well-intentioned and often disturbing ""Kundun"" somehow doesnt convey the deep passion that Scorsese must have felt when he decided to make the movie against considerable odds. But this latest effort represents the closest Scorsese has come to making a ""silent"" film one whose strongest sequences work their enchantment sans dialogue or words. In the end credits the ""contribution and cooperation"" of the Dalai Lama are acknowledged though its hard to know precisely what that contribution was. Pic does not offer an ""official"" version of the charismatic leaders life but neither does it elucidate Tibets unique pacifist culture beyond what most informed viewers might already know. Following a straightforward chronological order story begins in 1933 with the death of the 13th Dalai Lama and the search for a successor. Its told from the subjective point of view of a child (at ages 2 and 5 in the first sequences) born in a remote rural area and destined to become the new Dalai Lama. Relying on Roger Deakins bravura lensing early chapters convey the unadulterated joy of a child at play. He giggles innocently when asked to identify objects placed on a table not realizing that to the monks observing him this is the beginning of a sacred process of divination one that results in labeling the boy the 14th reincarnation of the Buddha of Compassion. Richly detailed with utmost attention to visual detail and color composition first part sets a mysterious almost surreal tone for a movie that in its ritualistic concerns and formal beauty bears some resemblance to Bertoluccis ""The Last Emperor"" and ""Little Buddha"" without the latters overtly erotic charge and to Kurosawas epic films ""Kagemusha"" and ""Ran."" The story gets more somber when it jumps ahead to 1944 and the Dalai Lama learns about Nazism and the Hiroshima bombings from Western magazines and newsreels. At the end of WWII he is confronted with Chinas aggressive campaign to convince the world that Tibet belongs to it. Still a youngster hes forced to deal with political strife and spiritual adversity of the highest order. Pics second part begins in 1949 when Gen. Mao Zedong ruthlessly enforces Communist ideology in his country and tight military control over Tibet despite persistent protests from the Dalai Lama to let the region maintain its long-cherished autonomy. Last section depicts the Chinese massacre of innocent Tibetans the annihilation of a ""society of spirit"" and finally the Dalai Lamas successful journey into exile which continues at present. Maintaining a remarkably coherent p.o.v. throughout the film Scorsese keeps the camera close to the ground. In a series of masterful shots he depicts the comfort with which the young boy observes his parents feet moving across the house in their worn sandals. These shots assume stronger elegiac meaning when theyre later contrasted with the adult leader observing Maos shiny black Western shoes and realizing that his efforts to save Tibet are doomed. Its indicative of the scripts shortcomings that the films weakest sequences are those depicting the historically fateful meetings between the Dalai Lama and Chairman Mao. Heavily made up Robert Lins Mao speaks in broad slogans and mundane dialogue delivered by the actor with such mannered artifice that the Chinese leader comes across as a monstrous caricature borderline camp. ""Kundun"" (which means ""ocean of wisdom"") represents an exception in Scorseses extraordinary oeuvre in several respects. With the notable exception of ""Last Temptation"" most of Scorseses narratives have centered on small male groups of alienated paranoid individuals who are victims of their unbridled instincts. In contrast the beauty of ""Kundun"" is that it provides an intriguing collective portrait of a large community and its distinctive values rites and rituals. Scorseses specialty is in recording the random unpredictable flow of realistic events particularly spontaneous outbursts of rage and violence. But since everything in ""Kundun"" is historically pre-determined the text is inevitably quieter less spontaneous and more internal than his previous efforts. Unlike most of Scorseses other screen characters those in ""Kundun"" are articulate and restrained their behavior guided by an acute sense of morality. At the same time ""Kundun"" does express some of Scorseses perennial concerns such as the destruction of small distinctive subcultures when they are engulfed by larger political or economic forces whether its the disappearance of a graceful lifestyle in ""The Age of Innocence"" or the decline of petty mobsters before the corporations take over in ""Casinos"" Vegas. Scorsese deserves credit for making a relevant film that is not merely a political statement. But while his emphasis of the humanist and ritualistic elements of Tibets tragedy is commendable ultimately ""Kundun"" emerges as a movie thats hypnotic without being truly compelling sensuously stunning but not illuminating. Still the shallow narrative and commonplace dialogue are more than compensated for by helmers notable sense of kinetic energy evident here in the vitality and tension of Deakins spectacular visuals. Sumptuously mounted and lavishly shot (mostly in Morocco with second unit work in British Columbia and Idaho) pic has not a single superfluous or derivative image and features the kind of seamless mesmerizing rhythm that only an accomplished pro like editor Thelma Schoonmaker can provide. Avant-garde composer Glass has written a forceful varied score full of foreboding and mournfulness that lends unexpected textures to the film sustaining momentum even when the story threatens to stall. Its a tribute to Glass glorious achievement that its impossible to evaluate ""Kundun"" without acknowledging the unforgettable spell of his music.

An act of self-imposed exile its a Hollywood film only in the production credits and language. Theres minimal contextualising. The scenario (by Melissa Mathison) sticks to the Dalai Lamas point of view his discovery by Buddhist monks searching for the reincarnation of the 13th Dalai Lama among the farming communities of northern Tibet in 1935; his upbringing and tutelage in Lhasa; through the Communist Chinese invasion of 1950 to his own exile to India nine years later. The biographical detail is honest and illuminating be it the rodents given free range of the Potala palace the boys fascination with mechanics or his wonder at the opulent religious ceremonies. The film isnt remotely slow yet Scorsese rejects the tenets of Western melodrama and dispenses with the history in so swiftly that its easy to get lost in the sombre raptures of red gold and blue. Urged on by Philip Glasss throbbing blaring score the director conjures a phenomenal trance-like climax owing more to dreams second sight and the minds eye than conventional dramatic rhetoric.

Starring Tenzin Thuthob Tsarong Tencho Gyalpo Tsewang Migyur Khangsar Gyatso Lukhang. Directed by Martin Scorsese. (PG-13. 135 minutes. At the Regency.) Stunning odd glorious calm and sensationally absorbing director Martin Scorseses ""Kundun"" is a remarkable piece of work with vital colors and a wrenching message. That said it may not be for everybody. The films subject -- the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan struggle -- runs counter to the increasingly narrow focus of the American moviegoing public which puts ""Kundun"" at risk of being categorized as a novelty. The movie which opens today is the visually detailed biographical story of the 14th Dalai Lama spiritual and political leader of Tibet from his early childhood to his forced exile in 1959 at age 24. APPEALING STAR With a nearly all-Tibetan cast the film stars an appealing assured young actor named Tenzin Thuthob Tsarong who lives in India as the adult Dalai Lama. Tencho Gyalpo a member of the Tibetan parliament in exile plays his mother and Tibetan American scholar Tsewang Migyur Khangsar was cast as the father. The story crafted by screenwriter Melissa Mathison (wife of actor Harrison Ford) introduces the Dalai Lama as a toddler and follows his ""discovery"" by elders as a reincarnation of the Buddha through to his training by monks and enthronement as Tibets leader. It reveals a warmly human figure sometimes balking at his situation wrestling with ideas and beliefs occasionally gazing longingly at the world of regular folk. The Dalai Lama in Tsarongs careful reading of the character can be a bit remote or standoffish or even annoyingly stubborn. ""Kundun"" seems like a curious subject for an American director best known for movies exploring mans violent urges in a brash American landscape. But the odd turn by Scorsese is part of the complex fascination of ""Kundun."" In telling the story of the Dalai Lama or Kundun Scorsese portrays a man of peace bound in a tight brotherhood of monks whose life is devoted to the Buddhist ideal of compassion. Yet he stands at the center of one of the most violent assaults on a culture in contemporary times Chinas claim and control over Tibet. The young Mao Zedong is played by Robert Lin as ruthlessly matter-of-fact. Maos observation that ""religion is poison"" leaves the Dalai Lama speechless. FILM FEELS LIKE POEM ""Kundun"" is as near a nonverbal movie experience as were likely to find at theaters. It captures the essentials of an ancient culture and builds to Chinas brutal invasion both real and spiritual. But the film is so far from the slam-bang Hollywood approach that it sometimes feels more like a cinematic tone poem than a narrative motion picture. The cinematography filled with unexpected movement and odd angles dazzling costumes realistic settings and an exceptional score by composer Philip Glass who used traditional Tibetan vocal and instrumental forms add up to an extravagant feast of sensations. Some are so odd to outsiders -- the throaty drone of monks chanting the hissing trances of an oracle -- that theyre almost startling. All the more remarkable is that the film was created entirely outside of Tibet -- in Morocco. A tangle of mountains stone monasteries tall palaces the entire look and atmosphere of Lhasa Tibets capital were expertly fashioned complete with weathered texture. ""Kundun"" comes amazingly close to catching the thing movies almost never get -- the sensation of mans spiritual life. There is a riot of imagery in this film and an overwhelming tragedy of violence visited on a seemingly innocent culture. Yet the depiction of Buddhists including the ornate ritual of their religious-political cultural life is one of measured calm. ""Kundun"" is a film with a surprisingly rich inner life and great moments of stone silence and stillness. Can audiences handle it?
