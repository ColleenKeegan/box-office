Behind the hit-or-miss gags this is really a love story about two people who cant live without each other. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Bad SantaDirected by Terry ZwigoffAn antidote to forced holiday cheer this scabrously funny misanthropic comedy is not for the whole family. A magnificently debauched Billy Bob Thornton stars as the worlds most inappropriate department-store Santa-and thief. ""Bad Santa"" never goes soft even when a pudgy kid (Brett Kelly) becomes Thorntons tag-along admirer. Zwigoff doesnt hype up the gags and his deliberately deadpan style gives even far-fetched jokes an edge of reality.The Triplets of BellevilleDirected by Sylvain ChometThe tone of this droll thrillingly odd animated film isnt easy to describe; neither is its loopy plot about a melancholy French cyclist named Champion whos being trained for the Tour de France by his clubfooted grandma. Midrace hes kidnapped by French mafiosi (shaped like black rectangles)--and Granny and his dog Bruno take off in hot pursuit. Chomets delightful hand-drawn images evoke the 50s Paris of Jacques Tati. A tad dark for little kids this one-of-a-kind movie delivers 80 minutes of idiosyncratic inspiration.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

"At the Movies Bad Santa 112603 - The Augusta Chronicle Augusta Chronicle   | CC News Times   | Augusta.com   | Augusta Real Estate   | Augusta Autos   | Augusta Jobs   | Apartment Finder Site Web At the Movies Bad Santa By Christy Lemire| Associated Press Wednesday November 26 2003 You better watch out The ads for ""Bad Santa"" suggest that its a wacky holiday romp. Far from it The movie is relentlessly dark. Its also infinitely funnier than youd expect. Director Terry Zwigoff proves again as he did with ""Ghost World"" (one of the best films of 2001) how acutely observant he is of human quirks. And Thornton proves again as hes done in nearly every film hes ever made that hes not afraid to play a miserable character. Theres nothing likable about Willie a part-time department store Santa Claus and full-time alcoholic con man. Yet hes strangely irresistible - to his reluctant partner (Tony Cox) a midget who dresses as an elf; to a bartender (the sexy adorable Lauren Graham) who happens to have a Santa fetish; and to a chirpy cherubic boy (Brett Kelly) who truly believes Willie is Kris Kringle and clings to him as a father figure. Willie and Marcus (Cox best known for his memorable supporting role in ""Me Myself amp; Irene"") go from city to city tolerating the seemingly endless array of children who want something shiny and new on Christmas morning. But the Santa gig is merely an excuse to get inside department stores in order to crack their safes and do a little after-hours shopping on Christmas Eve. Then they get to Phoenix where Willies erratic behavior raises the suspicions of the department store manager (John Ritter in his last film role) and the security chief (an underused Bernie Mac) whos a suspicious character himself. Ritter to whom the film is dedicated plays the perfect uptight foil - similar to his character in ""Sling Blade"" in which he also co-starred with Thornton. Willie is profane and anti-social a chain smoker who drinks so heavily hes oblivious when he urinates all over himself. Hes an unscrupulous shell of a man with no chance at redemption - not that he wants one. Thornton plays him as if he were a character in a drama without a trace of caricature which makes him totally believable. Somehow Willie stumbles into a cushy life when he moves in with a chubby insecure boy whose wealthy father is in prison; the only other person in the house is the boys clueless grandmother (Cloris Leachman who doesnt get to do much besides offer to make sandwiches). He also gets a girlfriend whom he didnt pursue but doesnt mind having around. The humor from screenwriters Glenn Ficarra and John Requa who also wrote the much tamer ""Cats amp; Dogs"" sneaks up on you. While the film appears on its surface to be yet another exercise in cynicism like the insufferably heavy-handed ""Death to Smoochy"" its surreal deadpan nature is more reminiscent of the hugely underrated ""Office Space."" It doesnt beat you over the head with the fact that its raunchy and edgy - it simply is. Willie dismisses one child after another for their trite gift choices then enjoys a quickie with a strange woman in the plus-size dressing room. Its all in a days work. Even when the film threatens to turn feel-good it thankfully resists the urge; when Willie finally comes up with a toy for the boy whos inexplicably befriended him its covered in blood. Thats a perfect metaphor for the film itself. ""Bad Santa"" a Dimension Films release is rated R for pervasive language strong sexual content and some violence. Running time 95 minutes.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet There are exactly two big heartwarming moments in Terry Zwigoffs gloriously rude black comedy Bad Santa The first involves a raging drunken mall Santa repeatedly punching an adolescent boy in the face and the second centers on the delivery of a plush toy drenched in blood. Bad Santa isnt exactly Its A Wonderful Life but deep within the accumulation of ugliness and bile lurks some genuine Christmas cheer though it may take nose plugs and a shovel to find it. A Wild Turkey chaser to decades of sticky holiday sentiment the film glares with the unmistakable crankiness of the man behind 1995s Crumb and 2001s Ghost World yet it has his bristled soul too. In resuscitating the wheezy old setup of an embittered loner redeemed by a doe-eyed imp Bad Santa wants to be loved just like every other formulaic Hollywood comedy but only on its own uncompromising terms which just makes it all the more lovable. Perfect as the titular half-shaven rummy Billy Bob Thornton joins R. Crumb and Ghost Worlds Enid in the proud tradition of Zwigoff heroes playing another sour outcast who retches at everyday banality. Since nothing is more banal than mall Santas Thornton presides over his own private hell at a department store in a suburban Arizona mall where he and his partner in crime a black ""elf"" played by Tony Cox are working their annual robbery scheme. Before cracking the stores safe at seasons end Thornton has to tend to the gaggles of screaming kids but when he isnt too plastered to take the throne he greets them with muffled profanities or worse. (When one child wonders why his beard is falling off he replies ""Because I loved a woman who wasnt clean."") Once store manager John Ritter and head security guard Bernie Mac start poking around Thornton crashes with a pasty snot-nosed fat kid (Brett Kelly) who holds an unwavering belief in Santa Claus. In other hands Bad Santa might have been Death To Smoochy revisited. But Zwigoffs deadpan scowl is miles away from that films strident wackiness and more genuinely subversive and nasty to boot. Mainly Bad Santa is just an ill-mannered convulsively funny farce as ripe as a Richard Pryor stand-up routine and centered on a heroic louse who leers at plus-sized asses and blasts a soccer mom for interrupting his break. Much like School Of Rock Bad Santa salvages a tired paint-by-numbers formula by resisting it every step of the way stubbornly refusing to stop its juvenile fun until the last possible moment. Even then Santa in a giving mood isnt what most children have in mind.

At one point in his long and laborious transformation Algren is told by a samurai swordsman that he fights with ""too many mind"" -- the vice of thinking about it rather than just doing it in what the samurai calls a ""no-mind"" way. The same goes for watching the movie. Too many mind and the story grows tedious or absurd. No mind and the spectacle suffices. Its an impressive spectacle once the woefully sluggish exposition is out of the way -- cities seized by Westernized culture and technological change serene landscapes barely touched by the hand of man suddenly overrun by a newly mechanized Japanese army. Captain Algren has been hired to train Japans troops for their campaign against rebellious samurais who led by the legendary Katsumoto (a strong performance by Ken Watanabe) wield only traditional swords bows and arrows. But Algren guilt-stricken about the slaughter of native Americans and suffering from chronic flashbacks identifies with the enemy. He becomes one of them like the Civil War soldier in ""Dances With Wolves"" or the shipwrecked British sailor in ""Shogun"" then joins them in their last doomed stand. Lots of movies come to mind as youre watching ""The Last Samurai"" which Edward Zwick directed from a script he wrote with John Logan and Marshall Herskovitz. (Lilly Kilvert did the superb production design and the reliably excellent John Toll was the cinematographer.) Mr. Zwick has taken inspiration quite openly from the late master of the samurai genre Akira Kurosawa and his film may also induce flashbacks to ""The Karate Kid"" ""Braveheart"" ""The Wild Bunch"" ""Star Wars"" (Algren the Zennish swordsman tapping into his own Force) even ""The King and I"" (Algren as Anna to Katsumotos inquisitive monarch). Fair enough as far as it goes; Kurosawa borrowed liberally from Shakespeare. Yet it doesnt go far enough for us to feel much of anything as Algren goes through all sorts of hell on a mission most improbable first as Katsumotos captive (he learns to speak Japanese in a matter of months) and later as his acolyte ad hoc strategist and joyous -- except not joyous enough -- companion in arms if need be to the death. Mr. Cruise looks good in the bloody exciting battle sequences; at the age of 41 when many samurai warriors would have been long dead hes still fit lithe and quick. Still its hard not to giggle toward the end at the spectacle of him encased in medieval body armor like a hirsute turtle on its hind legs. His Algren is more a collection of attitudes and behaviors than a specific spontaneous character. (He indicates several attitudes by narrowing his eyes.) And those martial sequences give way to extended dawdles distinguished mainly by authentic period details and period pacing. During one of them the closest thing in the movie to a love scene Algrens eyes are opened wide by Taka (the Japanese actress and model Koyuki) a taciturn beauty who washes his wounds and nurses him back to health. Takas distinction is that she robes her man for battle instead of being disrobed by him. A would-be epic that wants to soar ""The Last Samurai"" is grounded by a script thats short on logic (exactly what are the samurai rebelling against the specter of unemployment?) and long on such flights of fancy language as Katsumoto telling Algren that ""the perfect blossom is a rare thing"" or Algrens fulsome description of Katsumotos followers as ""an intriguing people -- from the moment they wake they devote themselves to the perfection of whatever they do."" That blossom business comes back to blight the movies climax which would have been silly enough without the added burden of turgid dialogue. In this case those who live by the sword die by the word. My Flesh and Blood ""I have issues"" proclaims a T-shirt worn by Xenia a radiant pre-teen in a documentary called ""My Flesh and Blood."" Issues indeed Xenia was born without legs. When she plays a woman sawed in half in a backyard Halloween show you can only gasp at her joyous audacity. Shes part of a family thats fairly bursting with issues 10 young people all but one of them with physical or emotional disabilities whove been adopted by a California woman named Susan Tom. Jonathan Karshs film is by turns chilling mysterious and inspiring; sometimes its all of those at once. Whats chilling is the nature of some of their afflictions -- Anthonys skin disease which makes ""The Singing Detective"" look like a chronic complainer; Joes cystic fibrosis compounded by a savage array of emotional illnesses; Faiths burned face fitted by plastic surgeons with pinchable cheeks but whos to pinch them once shes left the nest? The mysteries are harder to describe let alone explain. Why does Ms. Tom do what she does and how can she do it? She has issues too. Her only source of income is the public-assistance money that her adoptive children bring in. Is her selflessness unalloyed and does it matter? According to her mother who is interviewed on camera she was lonely as a child. Now as an unmarried obese adult she might be further isolated were it not for the family shes assembled. Susan Tom is a rock for these kids though not always a source of wisdom. When 18-year-old Margaret who has no disability begs her mother to understand her ample reasons for being angry and depressed Ms. Tom cant seem to stop long enough to listen or simply to ask that the camera be turned off. Yet the inspirational content is clear. Against staggering odds these kids have found a mothers love. Bad Santa Last week I missed the opening of ""Bad Santa"" because of a screening conflict. Now that Ive caught up with it Im conflicted about the picture which is scabrously funny in fits and starts -- an over-the-counter (and over-the-top) antidote for Yuletide treacle -- but sometimes clumsy enough to give misanthropy a bad name. Billy Bob Thornton plays Willie T. Stokes a compulsively obscene boozily morose and cheerlessly lecherous ex-con working an annual scam with a shrewd partner who keeps him on the crooked and narrow. (The partner an invective-spewing black dwarf named Marcus is played with great panache by Tony Cox.) Each year at Christmas Willie and Marcus get themselves hired at a shopping-mall department store as Santa and his elf then hide until after closing time and crack the stores safe. ""Bad Santa"" was directed by Terry Zwigoff from a script by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa. The film features Bernie Mac as a sly security chief and John Ritter in his last performance as an obsequious store manager. Mr. Zwigoff is the man who did the extraordinary documentary ""Crumb"" and whose eerily poetic feature debut ""Ghost World"" explored dark corners of its characters souls. This time his technique feels uncertain -- slacker direction that goes slack. Yet Mr. Thorntons Willie is a paragon of comic repulsiveness and hes softened only slightly by the weirdly sweet presence of Thurman Merman (Brett Kelly) a blissed-out broad-beamed victim of a kid who insists on believing in him. I wanted to believe in ""Bad Santa."" At least half of the time I did.    DVD TIP ""Throne of Blood"" (1957) is Akira Kurosawas wild and magnificent fusion of ""Macbeth"" with samurai culture and Noh Theater conventions in feudal Japan. (The movies castle set was actually built on the slopes of Mount Fuji.) The peerless Toshiro Mifune plays the Macbeth figure Takitoko Washizu who dies in an almost hallucinatory hail of arrows. Now that is a climax.

Indeed he only does the job as a cover for the felonies he perpetrates with Marcus (Tony Cox) his criminal-mastermind elf. But then Willie has two not-quite-life-changing encounters one with self-confessed Santa-groupie Sue (Lauren Graham); the other with parentless eight-year-old Thurman Merman (Brett Kelly) whose innocence verges on idiocy and who happens to live in a mansion thatd make a great home for Willie.  Admittedly this black comedy - from an idea by the Coens and directed by the esteemed creator of Crumb and Ghost World - is pretty much a one-joke film; true too that at the very end it sweetens much of whats gone before with a spoonful of sentimentality. But it is for the most part quite hilarious in its foul-mouthed malice and disenchantment with all things wholesome and familial; few films have been as funny about greed lust incontinence midgets or kicks to the balls. The secret is that Terry Zwigoff Thornton et al play it straight (though a few scenes featuring the store manager and a mall detective are far less funny - reputedly they were added by another director after Zwigoff refused to pad the film out to the more conventional running time requested by Miramax). Wonderfully tasteless gloriously non-PC admirably bilious; humourless souls should steer clear.

"Bah Humbug Bad Santa Renews Xmas Spirit | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Style amp; Design Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Bah Humbug Bad Santa Renews Xmas Spirit By Andrew Sarris  12/15/03 1200am Terry Zwigoffs Bad Santa  from a screenplay by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa is the funniest send-up of bad Christmas karma I have ever seen. Its also one of the happiest surprises of this already wearisome ho-ho-ho season burdened as it is with an excess of hype hysteria and hypocrisy. Mr. Zwigoff and his screenwriters have set out to demolish with humor every last vestige of cheery falseness unleashed around this time each year. With more F-word profanity than any Christmas movie I can think of-more even than your average R-rated movie- Bad Santa virtually orders the tots to stay away from this wonderfully defiant adults-only entertainment. And yet (and this is the amazing part) Bad Santa ends up with the same deeply felt Christmas spirit as the familiar Yuletide classics beginning with the first screen adaptation of Charles Dickens A Christmas Carol . Im thinking particularly of Frank Capras Its a Wonderful Life (1946) George More OFerralls The Holly and the Ivy (1952) and Bob Clark and Jean Shepherds A Christmas Story (1983) as movingly grown-up predecessors to Bad Santa . Billy Bob Thornton plays Willie the bad Santa in question with a perpetually hung-over scowl for anyone foolish enough to seek holiday cheer on the basis of his seasonal attire. In fact Willie is a professional safecracker who merely uses his Santa costume as a cover for casing the department stores that hire him with his partner in crime Marcus (Tony Cox) a mean-spirited African-American dwarf who masquerades as Santas elf. Much of the movie is merriment and the dramatic arc arises from our gradual realization that Marcus is not only the brains and driving force of the covertly felonious team but that he is also becoming ominously displeased with Willies drunkenness and un-Santa-like womanizing. Willie and Marcus are initially so broadly drawn as diabolical inversions of all that is supposed to be lovable about Santa and his elf that the moral divergence between Willie and Marcus is much less perceptible-which is part of the films subtlety. Also as much as Willie and Marcus present themselves as cynical predators the world in which they find themselves is hardly all sweetness and light and limitless credulity. Indeed the only out-and-out ""straight"" character in the mix is Bob Chipeska (the late John Ritter) the store manager whom Willie and Marcus terrorize with the threat of an anti-discrimination lawsuit on behalf of minority ""little people"" when he proposes firing them both for improper behavior. Willie and Marcus are less successful in gulling the stores security chief Gin (Bernie Mac) an unflappable African-American con man in his own right. Having seen through their scam from the outset Gin coolly cuts himself in for half the booty following a hilarious session of one-sided haggling between the supremely confident security chief and an extremely frustrated Marcus. But this little transaction sets up a surprisingly dark denouement that rearranges the moral alignment with death and near-death disrupting the genre conventions. Willies moral redemption is realistically slow in coming but Mr. Thorntons restraint in his moments of potentially explosive surliness enables him to control the pace of his characters gradual awakening out of an alcoholic haze to the feelings of tenderness and love that had been slumbering in him. If Mr. Thornton had pulled out all the stops in his initially roguish period he wouldve gotten a few big laughs from the audience who would then rapidly tire of his one-note character. By keeping so much in reserve and letting it out without much fuss Mr. Thornton gives one of the best performances of the year in a part that could easily have degenerated into facetious farce. That it didnt is also a credit to Mr. Zwigoffs direction. The two essential instruments of Willies redemption are a fat easily bullied little kid (played with marvelously imperturbable patience by Brett Kelly) and a sweetly amusing lady bartender named Sue (Lauren Graham) with an unrealized sex fetish for Santa since childhood. The kid whose father is away in prison for embezzlement invites Willie into his luxurious home in which the only other occupant is his comically somnolent grandmother (Cloris Leachman) while Sue invites Willie-in his Santa suit-into her bed without coyness or conditions. In contrast to Willies easy uncomplicated relationship with the very maternal Sue Marcus is hitched up with Lois (Lauren Tom) a cold-as-ice Asian barracuda as ruthless as he is. The clues are all there for the films final confrontation between good and evil except that theres still an element of surprise involved. Willie and Marcus make such an engaging comedy team that were conditioned to expect them to exit together smiling and happy. But Mr. Thorntons (and Mr. Zwigoffs) Willie is made of much sterner stuff. Cerebral Cartooning Sylvain Chomets The Triplets of Belleville has received rapturous notices from most of my esteemed colleagues but my first reaction was somewhat different It was too cerebral too strange and too art-gallery conscious for my taste in animation-which Im embarrassed to say hasnt progressed much since Dumbo (1941). Part of the problem is that Ive spent my life in the fantasy apparatus of narrative live-action cinematography-a tantalizing medium that merges creative art and recorded reality. Animation for better or worse is all creativity with varying degrees of anthropomorphic allegory. Though Ive been moderately amused by some animation over the years its not really my turf. Still as more and more of my friends have talked to me about The Triplets of Belleville  Ive begun to savor isolated images that have stuck in my memory. Above all I love Bruno the dog that grows old fat and clumsy pursuing his obsession for barking at moving trains ever since a toy train ran over his tail as a puppy. Significantly Bruno is the only character in Belleville with a dream life of his own; the sight of him lumbering up the stairs is as moving an image as any Ive ever seen. Perhaps its the recurring rear view that makes Bruno so well doggedly human. There are some other equally interesting characters in the story (besides the triplets themselves). The old round-faced grandmother and her equally round-faced grandson are drawn in minimalist lines making them emotionally distanced from the more accessible parent-child figures of conventional kids cartoons. The grandmother single-mindedly looks for something to interest her mostly catatonic grandson and when he shows a liking for his new tricycle she begins training him in earnest for the Tour de France. He grows up to be a perpetually exhausted beak-nosed freak with outsized leg muscles. But on his first race hes kidnapped by the French mafia who force him to compete in a bizarre indoor replica of the Tour de France. (Using a process-shot screen simulating the distance traversed by the cyclist the gamblers in the gallery bet on the computed outcome.) The triplets themselves are a French version of the Andrews Sisters but much jazzier. They are first seen in their youth as performers on a televised variety show but for most of the film theyre withered yet still rhythm-conscious hags who help the grandmother rescue her grandson from the hoodlums in ways that defy gravity and every other law of physics and probability. Belleville itself is part Paris part New York and part Montreal though entirely populated by the clinically obese-a painterly mannerism that reads as an anti-American message to some reviewers. I think thats a bit of a stretch. When the grandmother puts her foot out and sends the pursuing gangsters cars tumbling to their doom I couldnt help thinking of my own brave mother who once faced down a gun-toting would-be burglar and made him run for his life when she picked up an ax. The comparative abstractness of Mr. Chomets vision allows the mind to wander freely. So I guess I mustve liked the Triplets of Belleville after all. War Crimes Norman Jewisons The Statement  from a screenplay by Ronald Harwood based on the novel by Brian Moore makes the most reprehensible antihero imaginable into its protagonist. Pierre Brossard (Michael Caine) is still on the run 40 years after he is shown murdering French Jews during the Vichy era. Now in his 70s hes the object of a two-pronged manhunt the first by an avenging half-Jewish magistrate (Tilda Swinton) and a conscientious French Army officer (Jeremy Northam); and the second by mysterious forces within the Catholic Church and the French government intent on silencing Brossard before he reveals the identities of his protectors for the last four decades. The problem with the scenario is this Who exactly are we supposed to root for? To his credit Mr. Caine creates a credibly unheroic guilt-ridden religious fanatic a Mel Gibson-type reactionary Catholic who opposes the liberalizing tendencies in the church-explicitly in the movie the churchs abandonment of the Latin liturgy. Yet Brossard remains a formidable adversary for his enemies managing to kill two of his would-be assassins during the chase. Another problem Its bad enough that the performers a largely British cast of well-known actors are pretending to be French-but on top of that theyre speaking English. (And this at a time when more and more English-language films set in foreign locales are resorting to incorporating the native tongue.) Still the human dimensions of the story are subordinate to the real moral issue at the center of the film the Catholic Churchs active role in the Holocaust. But as the youngest possible Holocaust criminals reach and pass their 70s 80s and 90s and the rest die off from natural causes one wonders how much longer this subject will be relevant to the political situation in Europe. A new wave of anti-Semitism is being nurtured under the cover of supposed sympathy for the stateless Palestinians and an antipathy to the state of Israel. (Why do these sentiments rarely correspond for example to a sympathy for the Tibetans and an antipathy to China?) Nonetheless its good to see such estimable performances from Mr. Caine Ms. Swinton Mr. Northam Charlotte Rampling Alan Bates and Ciaran Hinds who are all gainfully employed on an increasingly outdated subject.

"The Last Samurai and Bad Santa. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Last Samurai and Bad Santa. The Last Samurai and Bad Santa. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 4 2003 836 PM Santa Slays Billy Bob Thornton vs. kids in Bad Santa. Tom Cruise vs. capitalism in The Last Samurai. By David Edelstein At home in Japan In theaters this holiday season are two melodramas of redemption that begin with their heroes stinking drunk the disillusioned Indian fighter Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) who ultimately joins forces with a band of fundamentalist nationalist warriors against the armies of Western capitalist modernity in The Last Samurai (Warner Bros.); and the alcoholic misanthropic big-butt fetishist Willie (Billy Bob Thornton) who sort of half-discovers the maybe-true meaning of Christmas at the end of Bad Santa (Dimension). Both films are a fascinating mixture of the conventional and the outlandish but only Bad Santa has a sense of humor about its own absurdity. The Last Samurai is reverently nuts. It is a western fundamentally and in a tradition of genre pictures about former Indian hunters who learn to think like the ""savages."" In the old days this enabled them to hunt Indians better--and thats one of the buried tropes in Ron Howards The Missing the have-it-both-ways western in which Tommy Lee Jones can be both of the Indians (he abandoned his white family and Western culture for the way of the Apache) and the only man who can kill them--to liberate his granddaughter from demonic homicidal redskins who want to sell her to Mexicans. The Last Samurai is from a liberal racially conscious counterculture Western tradition as befits its director Edward Zwick (Glory [1989] The Siege [1998]). Its protagonist Algren served with Custer (whom he loathed for his arrogance and sadism) and has visions of Native American women and children being shot down as they flee. In the course of the movie he will enter into another ancient mystical non-rationalist culture--the way of the Japanese samurai. He will overcome his alcoholism learn to fight without all that pesky thinking and discover his deep-seated spirituality. (The Last Samurai doesnt really have the guts to be a true ""conversion"" melodrama because Algren isnt shown doing anything wrong in the Indian massacre scenes. He registers horror and attempts to convince his fellow officers to stop.) Advertisement The movie--from a script credited to John Logan Marshall Hershkovits and Zwick--is a real piece of narrative spoon-feeding All its themes are laid out like index cards on a screenwriters bulletin board and each plot turn seems so inevitable that youll think you saw this movie in a previous life. (You did.) First the drunken guilt-ridden Algren is enlisted by the Japanese government (in collusion with American business and military leaders) to suppress the rebellion of ""another tribal leader"" a samurai lord called Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). ""I am beset by the ironies of my life"" intones Cruise in a voice-over while his long hair blows in the breeze as his ship docks in 1876 Yokohama. Hes not the only one beset by ironies. When hes captured by Katsumoto and gradually falls in love with the culture of the remote mountain village in which hes held its like were in a pre-9/11 time warp. Its weird to watch nowadays a film in which the American hero is seduced by the other sides warlord to fight against his own ""barbarian"" capitalist country--to see the multiplex audience cheer a man who it could well in a slightly different context want to see tried and executed. Movies can manipulate you to root for just about anyone anytime. Cruise gives a confident superstar performance and one with no off-putting 19th-century period airs When he puts on a ceremonial robe and makes a few self-conscious warrior moves hes the same guy in his underwear from Risky Business (1983) minus some baby fat and an overbite. He seems to have learned the lesson from his Japanese co-stars--especially Watanabe as Katsumoto the proud leader of a samurai collective--that it wouldnt be cool to be caught doing a lot of American Method overemoting. As they say in prison Cruise holds his mud. Zwick lets his go There are scorchingly well-shot and -edited action scenes especially compared with Ron Howards incoherent shootouts in The Missing. Ninja assassins burst through shoji screens and go blade to blade with Algren and Katsumoto--and youre wowed by the kinetic fury while just grasping the sense. The climactic battle scene--in which waves of samurais attack waves of musket-waving government troops before the military breaks out the Howitzers--is a blur of long blades and arrows and rifle barrels yet Zwick doesnt lose his bearings. Its only in retrospect that you might be hit by the colossal waste--human not cinematic. Advertisement Katsumoto goes into battle for the last time after the ruling council refuses to let him enter the chamber with his sword and I thought ""Take off your goddamned sword."" I also thought ""Who cares if a bunch of Japanese businessmen want to wear English bowler hats?"" The finale of The Last Samurai is blood-engorged orgy that ends with a quasi-erotic embrace between two bullet-ridden warriors. You cant really hate a war that ends with the senseless death of thousands when it gives rise to the years most romantic clinch. Bad Santa is basically one joke over and over Billy Bobs Willie is disgusting. He says vile things to kids and viler things to their parents and when he isnt brusquely going through the motions as Santa hes swilling vodka or sodomizing large women as well as the not-too-large and very sweet Santa groupie played by Lauren Graham. Willie is also an ace safecracker--the one thing his derelict daddy ever taught him how to do he says. His partner the criminal mastermind is a steely midget named Marcus (Tony Cox). Every year they set up shop as Santa and an elf at a different mall or department store and every year on Christmas Eve they crack another safe and give themselves a merry little Christmas indeed. One of the things you have to get past is that theres no way even the laziest and most inattentive parents would let their kids sit on this guys lap and no way theyd let him keep spewing four letter words and waving around broken liquor bottles and passing out and wetting his Santa suit without calling the cops. To feel the true joy of Bad Santa you have to step outside the narrative and put yourself in the heads of Thornton and the director Terry Zwigoff (who on the basis of Crumb [1994] has a connoisseurs appreciation for big butts) and the executive producers Joel and Ethan Coen. You have to imagine them watching the first encounter between Willie and the motherless and fatherless kid who will ultimately stir him to sort of Christmassy humanist acts--an obese simpleton played by Brett Kelly with a big blob of snot under his nose. Willie drunk cant even be bothered to affix his beard properly and when the poor kid queries him on the absence of hair he replies that he lost it because he was sick Kid How did you get sick?Willie Santa loved a woman who wasnt clean.Kid Mrs. Santa?Willie Her sister. Advertisement You have to imagine what it felt like when the director yelled ""Cut"" and everyone collapsed on the set and said ""Can we get away with this? Is nothing sacred?"" Billy Bob Thorntons performance is--theres no other word--beautiful. When Thornton played the James Carville figure in Primary Colors his timing was great but he didnt have that outsized demented swallow-the-world quality that Carville himself radiates; Thornton is curdled and bilious with sallow skin and liver lips. He doesnt click in every part but hes the greatest Bad Santa imaginable. Hes in a tradition of Southern/Texan misanthropic derelict nihilists the arena of Hunter S. Thompson Harry Crews  and Terry Southern. Those of us who love it (and not everyone does to say the least) go for the mixture of the archly sophisticated and the potty-mouthed. Bad Santa is a gonzo parody of a Christmas redemption movie but it also hits all the Christmas redemption movie beats which means you also get that warm fuzzy feeling while Lauren Graham is chanting ""Fuck me Santa. Fuck me Santa. Fuck me Santa"" while Thornton goes at her from behind. It isnt really subversive because it doesnt have subversive ideas Its domesticated gonzo like the equally fun but much cleaner School of Rock. Willies Christmas epiphany is when he stands up for the kid whos being bullied by some skater boys. Later he tells Marcus ""I beat the shit out of some kids today ... but it was for a purpose."" The kid meanwhile is dopey and ingenuous--or to use the patois of Billy Bobs Willie a retard. It isnt entirely clear if he believes that this criminal alcoholic pervert is Santa or that he thinks this is the best Santa someone like him could ever get and therefore chooses to believe. I think its the latter which brings a tear to my aged eye. Yes Virginia there is a Santa Claus. It just depends how low youre willing to sink.

Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News An African-American dwarf cum elf with a bad attitude a department-store St. Nick who pees in his costume and more synonyms for copulation than you can shake a candy cane at ""Bad Santa"" is almost symphonic in its crudeness. When a movies press notes include a quote from comedian Dick Gregory (""I never believed in Santa Claus because I knew no white man would be coming into my neighborhood after dark"") you know youre in for something thats a little saltier than the usual holiday cheer. And yet director Terry Zwigoff (""Crumb"" ""Ghost World"") manages to turn vulgarity into its own kind of style. By the end of ""Bad Santa"" youll have heard the F-word so many times that it barely registers Like the rhythm section in a wedding band its just there. Youll also have learned what the three Bs are. (The most printable one is ""booze."") In fact youll learn a lot from ""Bad Santa"" and if you know whats good for you you wont repeat any of it to your mother. On the other hand if youre a sailor headed for shore leave you might want to take notes. Billy Bob Thornton is a bony unshaven department store Santa who with his very short partner Tony Cox specializes in robbing retail establishments at Christmastime. (After store hours Thornton cracks the safe while Cox ""shops"" from an illustrated list given to him by his girlfriend tossing Manolo Blahnik pumps and Judith Lieber purses into a giant shopping cart as if they were bags of potato chips.) By day though Thornton in between swigs of Old Granddad and vigorous butt scratching has to suffer through hours worth of holding innocent munchkins on his lap as they prattle on about what they want for Christmas. He rushes them through assembly-line style interrupting their earnest requests with snarling asides like ""Make it quick Santas gotta pee."" An overweight and slightly warped kid played by Brett Kelly changes everything for Thornton but the redemption in ""Bad Santa"" isnt the sloppy sappy kind. Thorntons character isnt the kind of guy who changes overnight; hes the kind of guy you cant believe would change at all. He spends half the movie running around in various bits of Santa garb Much of the time he wears a limp white T-shirt his skeletal tattooed arms dangling out of its rippling sleeves his Santa pants hanging low and loose on his almost nonexistent butt. The beard he wears on duty is gray and ratty and cheap and when one kid yanks it off and expresses surprise that its not real Thornton reveals that his real beard fell out as the result of his being sick. What was wrong with him? the kid wants to know. ""I loved a woman who wasnt clean"" says Thornton with deadpan lackadaisical solemnity. You Might Also Like Thornton who drinks swears and screws his way through the picture is wonderful Theres a mischievousness to his performance thats never coy or cute. He revels in the movies Rabelaisian spirit without ever looking over his shoulder to make sure were getting it. (The script is by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa who recently collaborated on Joe Dantes ""Looney Tunes Back in Action."") Zwigoff may have more actors here than he quite knows what to do with The always hilarious Bernie Mac plays a store detective but his role peters out to nothing and Cloris Leachman as an out-of-it grandma has only one line which she repeats twice ""Let me go make some sandwiches."" Its a shame she doesnt have more to do. But ""Bad Santa"" does feature one last turn from the late John Ritter as a twittery department-store manager (his name Mr. Chipeska is a stroke of brilliance that I still cant quite put my finger on). His anxiety over protecting ""the children"" from the filthy lout hes hired to play Kris Kringle gives the movie a nice shot of loopy nervous energy. As far as protecting the children goes parents are strongly cautioned If your children are over 40 its probably safe to take them to see ""Bad Santa"" but I leave that to your discretion. I will say though that I found the escalating disreputability of ""Bad Santa"" completely cathartic. After 90-odd minutes of salacious gross-out jokes and unapologetically bad behavior I left the theater feeling cleaner more virtuous and more filled with love for my fellow human beings than I did after that overcooked heartwarmer ""Love Actually"" (with its wearying catchphrase borrowed from the Troggs ""Love is all around""). Bad taste is better than no taste as style empress Diana Vreeland said and ""Bad Santa"" spreads it freely and honestly like fertilizer. You see love actually is all around as long as you know where to look. Stephanie Zacharek is a senior writer for Salon Arts amp; Entertainment. More Stephanie Zacharek.

Rick Groen From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Friday Nov. 28 2003 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Mar. 23 2009 1209PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Bad Santa Directed by Terry Zwigoff Written by John Requa and Glenn Ficarra Starring Billy Bob Thornton Tony Cox Lauren Graham Brett Kelly Classification 14A Rating  Bad Santa is a movie you hate to hate. After all it comes with the beckoning stamp of director Terry Zwigoff whose last two films -- the fictional Ghost World and the documentary Crumb -- were both delightful looks at idiosyncratic characters filled with an intoxicating mix of black humour and bright sensitivity. And the premise here -- this is a picture meant to be the seasons anti- Elf to pour a cup of hemlock into the saccharine vat of Christmas cheer -- seems a perfect fit for Zwigoff a subversive idea thats right down his dark alley. So what happened? Actually the more pertinent question is what didnt happen. This time Zwigoff didnt write the script. Instead that task fell to the team of John Requa and Glenn Ficarra whose previous credits run the family-comedy gamut from A to B specifically Cats amp; Dogs and the recent Looney Tunes Back in Action. Now released from the harness of good clean fun the two are like kids with the teacher out of the classroom -- they want to be foul-mouthed they want to be filthy they want to be BAD. Problem is theyre trying way too hard and whats meant to be a live-action South Park just winds up in a scatological dead end. Still if a gloomy thought has ever crossed your Yuletide mind if over the Muzak Jingle Bells youve ever entertained the faint suspicion that its not a wonderful life then youll definitely be on board at the start. Whos that guy in the red suit standing in the corner of a sleazy bar? Well hes a skinny alcoholic self-loathing Jewish son of a safecracker so he must be Santa. Naturally Santa -- a.k.a. Willie T. Stokes -- has an annual mission. Every Christmas he and his elfin buddy get a gig with a big-city department store. And every Christmas Eve having enjoyed ample time to case the joint they steal into its cash-stuffed vaults and -- Santa is his daddys son -- rob the store blind. This year the heist is in Phoenix but Santa is having trouble with the preliminaries. He cant control his chronic drinking or his potty mouth or his deep depression or his abiding sarcasm long enough to even fake it with the kiddies. Booze stains his suit nicotine flecks his beard and when a tyke scrambles onto his bony knee to make his Christmas wish Santas spat-out response is ""Well wish in one hand shit in the other see which fills up first."" Funny? Maybe the first time but after the umpteenth repetition of similarly high-minded banter the bloom is off the outhouse vine. And who gets to be the bearer of these malade tidings? In the absence of Jimmy Stewart the movie has hired on Billy Bob Thornton who to his credit throws Santa into the sewer with dogged conviction -- part hang-dog part junk-yard dog as apathy and meanness duke it out in his sodden brain. Tony Cox pops up -- 36 inches up -- as Santas tiny criminal helper while the late John Ritter has a brief cameo as the prissy and politically correct store manager. But if theres a picture-stealer here its surely Lauren Graham as Santas biggest helper -- a bar girl with a fetish for any guy decked out in a white beard and red coat. In the back of his stolen sleigh she gives him quite a ride. Then theres the chubby kid (Brett Kelly) so starved for affection that he believes even in this unjolly thin man. Of course in the hokum of the standard seasonal flick our not-so-Tiny Tim would be the catalyst who redeemed the sick Santa. But thats the trouble with a Black Christmas conceit Redeem the character and you violate the anti-schmaltz premise; dont and youve got nothing much to do except recycle the same nastiness. Mainly they dont here but the price is paid -- pretty soon the jokes are wearing as thin as the star. Perhaps for Zwigoff directing someone elses script this was just a job of work. If not the talent who made Crumb and Ghost World has now made his first movie mistake -- hes failed to realize that reverse sentimentality can be just as cloying as the common brand. It too can get right up your nose.

"Saint Nicks Polar Opposite washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Saint Nicks Polar Opposite Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Wednesday November 26 2003 ""Bad Santa"" for good or ill has been demographically engineered for the smallest interest group in America those who hate Christmas. You know who you are. You see through everything. All institutions are corrupt as are all belief systems. Folly prevails as the governing force in human transactions. When generosity heroism sacrifice or love are encountered they are to be regarded as part of a delusion-inducing apparatus meant to disguise darker initiatives of command and control. To you the most beautiful words ever uttered were ""Bah"" and ""humbug"" by your hero Ebenezer Scrooge. These people occupy a strange psychological state that might be called ""generally happy unhappiness"" and they will love ""Bad Santa"" with its soul-deep dyspepsia its cheerful blasphemy the delight it takes in the trashing of all that is dear sweet and holy. As for the rest of you Hello thats why they have multiplexes. Its called like make another choice. The joy of ""Bad Santa"" is that its Santa is really bad continually bad totally bad but also humanly bad. The movie is too absorbed in the imagination of squalor for larger constructs like mythology grandeur or evil. It simply asserts that people are too crummy Christmas is too fake the music is too cheesy and those lights give you a headache. It doesnt have the vision for a Nosferatu a Hannibal Lecter a Jesse James. At the same time its not at all sentimental about its bad hero. Hes not a cute ""outrageous"" curmudgeon like an Archie Bunker. Hes banally bad vile and scuzzy; he has hooch-halitosis and stains under his armpits. His signature chant isnt ""Ho ho ho"" its ""Me me me."" Hes so bad he might give bad a bad name. Hes white-trashy drunken abusive profane sexually pathological tied so tight in his own knot of self-hatred hes hardly recognizable as human -- that is unless you look in the mirror. I cant quote a single one of his lines because I just checked The Washington Posts dash drawer and were a little short today. Plenty of semicolons and umlauts and accents in there for the foreign correspondents but not nearly enough dashes for me to quote a line like ""Kid why dont you get the -- -- out of here before I -- -- kick your -- -- "" and thats where I run out of dashes. Why is this the role Billy Bob Thornton (who will be seen in a few months as a clean-shaven Col. Davy Crockett in ""The Alamo"") was born to play? The answer isnt that Bill Murray turned it down even after Joel and Ethan Coen (who co-produced) did a fast rewrite. No the answer is Probably because as an actor Thornton alone seems beyond vanity and beyond playing to the camera. He probably doesnt even know which side he photographs best from. Hes exactly what so-called great actors like Sean Penn would be if they really had some guts a performer who understands that food sometimes falls out of mouths that dirt inscribes fingernails that more conceptually idealization is the enemy of art. Anyhow Thorntons Willie T. Soke is a third-tier tank-town department store pro working the mall circuit who works just two months a year like so many others of his ilk. Except that on the night of Dec. 24 his friend and manager Marcus (Tony Cox a little person) will stop playing a Christmas elf and hide lingering in the store after closing hours. Then when all the boys and girls are in bed with visions of Nintendo and Jessica Simpson action figures dancing in their heads he will pop the place from inside readmitting Willie. Willie will uncover the tools hes smuggled in a piece at a time over November and December and will set about to crack a safe all but bulgy with Christmas cash. With that stash its off to Florida for 10 months of staying drunk on cheap wine while living on dirty sheets in a 38-a-night motel. Thats been the caper for many Christmases but Willie T. ever more pickled ever more sick at his own fecklessness his helplessness his inability to resist his appetites is taking ever so much longer to get the box open. One of these Holy Days hes not going to make it and will be then introduced to his new roommate and fiance 6-foot-8-inch inmate No. 5493559 of Cell Block D. So Marcus -- heres a subplot -- is thinking hes going to have to make other arrangements. To make it worse still this Christmas -- at a bleak and cheerless mall in suburban Phoenix where its hard to feel Christmasy when its 108 in the shade -- something strange happens. Willie T. meets a sad and lonely kid. The kid is even more pathetic than he is a punching bag for older kids a lump of lacerating self-loathing and -- this is such a fabulous anti-movie touch -- not even very attractive. (Brett Kelly is fabulous as the forlorn boy.) Through his mean-dog stupor his sexual opportunism his frequent fits of apoplectic rage Willie actually begins to . . . care. Suddenly the criminal life is beginning to lose its luster and in that wormy nest of pathology he calls a brain Willie is beginning to see the possibility of some kind of provisional redemption. You can see where this one is going and where it has to go. Not even Terry Zwigoff who directed two brilliant films ""Crumb"" and ""Ghost World"" has the guts to go the final three feet into all-out nihilism. So yes the movie ends on a note of putative uplift but to its credit its small-scale appropriate to the dismalness that is Bad Santas place in the scheme of things. The movie is -- how can I say this? -- funny as hell. Its like an old Mad magazine ""Scenes Wed Like to See"" put together by someone on crystal meth with a vicious streak an existentialist streak and no mercy anywhere in his soul and only the tiniest flinch at the end which is probably sigh the best way to end. Bad Santa at his baddest just doesnt give (oh look some extra dashes) a -- -- about anything. Put that in your chimney and smoke it it seems to be saying to the world. Bad Santa (93 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for extreme profanity and a generally dyspeptic view of humanity.

"Santa A Hearty Heh-Heh-Heh washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids On Screen Santa A Hearty Heh-Heh-Heh Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday November 28 2003 IF YOU cringe at the notion that all Christmas movies should involve some sort of miracle on 34th Street and youre having trouble understanding why ""Elf"" is making money have I got the flick for you. Its called ""Bad Santa"" and its naughty not nice. Make that very naughty. In Terry Zwigoffs movie Billy Bob Thornton is a department store Santa who curses burps and lurches his way through crowds of kids -- the ones eagerly lined up to tell him their Christmas wishes. Whats his game? Turns out hes Willie T. Stokes  a safecracker working with 3-foot-tall partner Marcus (Tony Cox) who plays his elf. When each Christmas season is done Willie and Marcus pocket their checks and say goodbye only to return that night to crack the safe. Their latest store this one in somewheresville Arizona proves to be the decisive one but not in the manner they anticipated. The problems are there from the start. Theres the fussy store manager (an amusing John Ritter in one of his final performances) who knows theres something kerflooey about this Santa and a security detective (Bernie Mac) who misses nothing. And then there are the more personal matters an attractive free-spirited woman named Sue (Lauren Graham) who has this ceaseless desire to uh spend private time with anyone dressed like Santa. And most significantly of all (though it doesnt seem that way at first) theres an unnamed 8-year-old pudgy boy (Brett Kelly) who seems to think Willie is the real thing. Its clear the kid has serious issues. His father is in the slammer for a white-collar crime and he lives with his oddball grandmother (Cloris Leachman) in a big house. He invites Santa to live with them. Willie sees all kinds of filching opportunities there. What he doesnt realize is he just met his match. One of the biggest problems of all is Willie himself. Clearly a drunk he can hardly reach his Santa chair without toppling over. His treatment of the children is offensive with language that could burn the fir off any Christmas tree. He jumps on women whenever he sees the opportunity and he even wets himself in the chair on one occasion. Its as much as Marcus can do to keep Willie from destroying their cover. Clearly ""Bad Santa"" is not for anyone who considers Christmas too sacrosanct to joke about. Nor is it for anyone who cant handle watching a verbally abusive adult and children in the same scene no matter how satirical or bleakly humorous the situation. But for you indecent scurrilous rascals with an elastic sense of humor ""Bad Santa"" is a subversive riot. Director Zwigoff who made ""Crumb"" and ""Ghost World"" continues an inspired countercultural streak with this one and screenwriters John Requa and Glenn Ficarra entirely redeem themselves for having written ""Cats amp; Dogs."" Perhaps any good actor would have done well in the central role. But Thornton with his one-of-a-kind drawl his lazy gaze restless shaggy eyebrows and misanthropic attitude seems to be the movies essential X-factor. He makes an entertaining and of course socially reprehensible spectacle of himself. In doing so he frees the audience to enjoy his badness. At first your reaction is stunned disbelief. But after youve warmed up to Willies ways he becomes increasingly amusing. Suddenly youre looking at life in his jaundiced way and laughing with a sense of vicarious liberation even when he says the most outrageous things -- to children no less. And I daresay you can still recover your holiday spirit when youre through laughing. BAD SANTA (R 93 minutes) -- Contains pervasive obscenity sexual content and some violence. Area theaters.

Photo Credit  Tracy Bennett ; on 7/11/02 in . Tracy Bennett / HO Photo Tracy Bennett A not-so-jolly old elf with a dark past holiday hangover 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Bad Santa Adult comedy. Starring Billy Bob Thornton Tony Cox Bernie Mac and Lauren Graham. Directed by Terry Zwigoff. Written by Glenn Ficarra John Requa and Jeff Schaffer. (R. 91 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Bad Santa"" is a tasteless vulgar savage assault against everything that is good and decent in the Christmas season. I think you are going to like it. What this uncompromising little bit of bad business has probably done unfortunately is ruin the mean-spirited comedy for a good five years. People are going to attempt to duplicate it and end up subjecting us to a pastiche of dumb locker-room humor and dysfunctional drunks. They wont have the intelligence of the Coen brothers Ethan and Joel who came up with this idea and whose ""Raising Arizona"" has the same feel. They wont have the deft touch of director Terry Zwigoff (""Ghost World""). And most of all they will not have the masterful decadence of Billy Bob Thornton. Thorntons character Willie opens the film on a barstool slumping in his bloodshot-red Santa suit polishing off another whiskey and squinting wearily through the haze of a cigarette. His first words are ""I was in prison once."" And he doesnt get much more lovable than that. Of course we think we know where this is headed. Cute kids troop up to Willies chair at his job as a Santa Claus at the mall. and it is just a matter of time before one of them warms his heart of gold and turns his miserable life around. Thats sort of what happens -- in between the fall-down drunken moments and the scene where the Kid (Brett Kelly) finds Willie in the garage with a hose running from a car exhaust pipe to the rolled-up window. Willie never does stop drinking or smoking or yelling and swearing at kids. As everyone tells Willie hes a loser. And he stays a loser. His arrival on the job midway through the film rising into view on the escalator hand still gamely clutching the railing although he has flopped down drunk on the moving steps is simply epic. It must have taken considerable restraint to resist playing ""Thus Spake Zarathustra."" But Zwigoff resisted and that makes all the difference. The idea is that Willie and his partner Marcus (Tony Cox) have perfected a Christmas scam. Cox who is very good may be your litmus test for the whole enterprise. If you dont think it is at least faintly amusing to see an ill-tempered foulmouthed dwarf this may not be the picture for you. Every year Willie scrawny and irritable as he is plays Santa and Marcus is his faithful helper. Then every Christmas Eve Marcus hides in the store and disables the alarm system clearing the way for Willie -- if he is sober enough -- to use his skill as a safecracker. The two make one big score a year then split up. This year however there is the feeling that things are coming to an end. Willie is even more drunk and unreliable than ever and Marcus the brains of the operation is fed up. Besides their yearly scam is starting to attract attention especially from a private investigator (Bernie Mac). Marcus warns Willie over and over that he has to get it together. He doesnt. The continuing pleasure of this film is that there is never a moment when Willie goes soft. When the Kid (as he is known throughout) takes him to his lavish house Willies first reaction is to note that it is a nice place. His second is to pull on a black ski mask and prepare to grab what he can. Around him all the normal folks are appalled. The late John Ritter does a brilliant turn as the store manager who cannot believe he has hired a drinking smoking unapologetic constantly cursing Santa Claus. Ritter seems in physical pain as he attempts to explain Willies latest embarrassment. I know there were tributes but now I realize why we are going to miss John Ritter. Oddly enough as uncompromising as it is this still manages to be a story of redemption. OK maybe not in the way you might have been expecting. And maybe not in the happy jolly Christmas way. But by the end if you dont laugh at Willies joke about his liver well I wonder if you really have any holiday spirit after all. -- Advisory Pervasive bad language strong sexual content and some violence.

"Santas Naughty -- But Funny - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections Santas Naughty -- But FunnyMOVIE REVIEW - Bad SantaNovember 26 2003|By Jay Boyar Sentinel Movie CriticTheres a very good reason that the trailers for Bad Santa are among the worst in recent memory.And its not the usual problem -- i.e. the movie bites.No in this case the trailers are lame because the film is so full of cussing and other forms of inappropriate behavior that there couldnt have been much material for the trailer-makers to choose from."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""649"" height=""160""gt;One thing they did well however is to get across the idea that Bad Santa definitely isnt for kids. Parents might have guessed that from the ""Bad"" in the title but in an extreme case like this its best to take no chances.Billy Bob Thornton is Willie T. Stokes a department-store Santa who must be near the top of the real Santas ""naughty"" list. Not only is Willies Santa shtick profane and otherwise miserable but hes secretly a safecracker.Every Christmas he and his partner in crime a larcenous little person named Marcus take jobs in a department store as Santa and his elf. Then as the yuletide season is ending they crack the stores safe and rob it blind.If you thought Elf was a tad outrageous by Christmas-movie standards Bad Santa (which opens today) will really mess with your mind.Terry Zwigoff who directed this film is a talented filmmaker with an iconoclastic spirit thats also obvious in his Ghost World and Crumb. The script credited to John Requa and Glenn Ficarra (the Looney Tunes Back in Action team) has according to Zwigoff been tweaked a lot by executive producers Joel and Ethan Coen.Much of the humor arises from the gap between Willies Santa job and his decidedly un-Santalike behavior. Early on we see him sitting at a bar smoking and drinking and dressed in his red-and-white togs. A little later as the movies title appears on the screen he vomits in an alley.Willie keeps at least some of that suit on through much of the movie as if to remind us that some sort of Santa -- even if its only a bad one -- is doing all the things he does.These include having sex with the cute but cuckoo Sue a bartender with an irresistible Santa fetish. They also include being drunk and profane in the presence of the children who show up to sit on his lap.Willies whole attitude is wrong for the job surly rude bored out of his skull. When one kid asks this Santa for a bike Willie feigns surprise and sarcastically replies ""Hey thats a new one.""All of this is great fun -- for a while.If youve seen a lot of Christmas movies and internalized the restrictions of the form you cant help but be shocked by how Willie acts. And if youre not totally offended you just have to laugh."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""649"" height=""110""gt;The problem is that after a while the shock starts to wear off. After youve heard a man in a Santa suit say the ""F"" word for perhaps the 17th time you start to get used to it.No matter how artfully the word is deployed you begin to want something more.Unfortunately Bad Santas bag is a little light. And although this is certainly no kiddie flick there is something a little juvenile about its eagerness to shock.Fortunately the cast is resourceful enough to keep the film at least watchable throughout.Stubble-faced Thornton is more convincing as a lowlife than may be healthy for his career. As Willie he rides a barstool the way Roy Rogers rode Trigger except that Willie is more likely to fall off.Tony Cox who plays Willies diminutive partner Marcus has a reasonableness that makes him a good foil for Willie. And its somehow funny that the pointed tips that this African-American wears on his ears when hes in elf drag are the color of white flesh.Zwigoff has discovered a terrific way to use comedian Bernie Mac (Charlies Angels Full Throttle) Something hilarious happens when Mac as a mall detective assumes the casual belligerence of corrupt authority.Hungry-eyed Lauren Graham (TVs Gilmore Girls) is funny as Sue the Santa-loving bartender and Brett Kelly as a plump curly-haired kid who wants desperately to believe in Willie makes a good straight man for him.""Need money to fix your sleigh?"" the boy innocently inquires as Willie loots the wall safe in his home.""Exactly"" Willie replies.Bad Santa is dedicated to the memory of the late John Ritter whose final film it is said to be. As the frightened store manager who hires (and is too intimidated to fire) Willie Ritter discovers hilarious moments of quiet panic.When all else fails the musical score often perks things up. Zwigoff who has always taken great care with the scores of his films finds a way to freshen even the music in a Christmas movie.Alongside such traditional choices as Bing Crosbys rendition of ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" and Andy Williams ""Its the Most Wonderful Time of the Year"" he includes Chopins Nocturne No. 2 in E-Flat Minor and the Anvil Chorus II from Verdis Il Travatore.There may not be enough ""nice"" material in Bad Santa for a decent trailer. But theres at least enough good ""naughty"" stuff for half of an indecently funny movie."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""649"" height=""110""gt; MORELottery results for Powerball Florida LottoLottery results for Powerball Florida LottoDo your homework before painting or sealing cool deckPuerto Rico birth certificates How to get a new oneLottery results for Powerball Florida LottoLottery results for Powerball Florida Lotto"");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""300"" height=""250""gt; Related ArticlesDashing Through Snow JobJune 25 2004`Bad Santa Director Terry Zwigoff Swimming Against The...December 3 2003Collision Kills Orlando ManJuly 31 20013 Die As Greyhound Bus Hits Truck On I-40 In TennesseeAugust 7 2004Index by Keyword|Index by Date|Privacy Policy|Terms of ServicePlease note the green-lined linked article text has been applied commercially without any involvement from our newsroom editors reporters or any other editorial staff.",http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2003-11-26/news/0311250532_1_bad-santa-santa-naughty-trailers,200,badsanta17,badsanta,orlandosentinel

Running time 91 minutes. Rated R (sex violence profanity). At the Empire the Cinema 1 the Kips Bay others. ANYONE suffering from sugar (or saccharine) shock after watching ""Elf"" may be in a receptive mood for ""Bad Santa"" a determinedly raunchy holiday comedy about a libidinous larcenous and perpetually soused St. Nick with a nonstop potty mouth. Parents of young children on the other hand may be less than thrilled with a red-suited hero who repeatedly utters the ""F-word"" to kids - and isnt adverse to pursuing ""back-door"" activity in the dressing room of the teens plus-sized department. ""Bad Santa"" in other words more than earns its R rating - and lots of low-down laughs from Billy Bob Thornton as a latter-day W.C. Fields in Santa suit. Thorntons Willie is a safecracker who works once a year when he and his dwarf pal Marcus (Tony Cox) plot to clean out the department store where theyre employed for the season on Christmas Eve. Marcus the brains of the outfit is supremely focused - but Willie is a disaster waiting to happen soiling his pants on Santas throne verbally abusing the kids constantly boozing and hooking up with a waitress (Lauren Graham) with a Santa fetish for erotic frolics in a hot tub. When the security manager (Bernie Mac) of the Arizona mall where theyre employed starts sniffing around Willie moves in with a dim insecure overweight 8-year- old (Brett Kelly) and his senile grandmother (Cloris Leachman). The kid is pretty hard to take but Willie (who introduces his girlfriend as ""Mrs. Santas sister"") finds the youngster grows on him to the point where hes considering going straight. Thornton is a hoot as are Cox and Mac and the scene where the latter two trade insults is the funniest in the film. But for all its laughs the movie - written by Glenn Ficarra and John Recqua (""Cats amp; Dogs"") from a concept by Joel and Ethan Coen - is a mess. John Ritter - amusing in his final role as a straight-arrow mall manager whos afraid to fire a black dwarf for political reasons - mysteriously disappears halfway through the proceedings. The disjointed storytelling is particularly surprising from director Terry Zwigoff who directed the pitch-perfect ""Ghost World"" two years ago. Part of the problem apparently came from the MPAA ratings board which forced cuts to avoid an NC-17 rating. Zwigoff reportedly did not participate in the lame tacked-on ""happy"" ending which was added at the studios behest after test screenings. These changes arent likely to sway a public that has shunned such recent black comedies as ""Duplex"" and ""Intolerable Cruelty"" - but ""Bad Santa"" seems destined to become a cult favorite on home video.

Its a good opening chortle from an often uproariously corrosive comedy geared to the humbugs among us. Billy Bob Thornton and Tony Cox have their hands full in Bad Santa. By Tracy Bennett Miramax/AP The movies abrasive tone -- up to its deliciously warped tidings-and-joy capper -- shouldnt beunexpected. Its director is Terry Zwigoff of Crumb and Ghost World two morbid-streak masterpieces that do not deal with the Chamber of Commerce types next door. Santa isnt in their class but its such an original that it could eventually become the No. 1 cult movie of 2003. As part of a nationwide shoplifting scam child-hating Thornton (with an ""elf"" cohort played by Tony Cox) spends Decembers as a mall Santa collecting kiddie pee and sneezed-up candy residue on his uniform. This year hes in Phoenix under the appalled eye of milquetoast store manager John Ritter (a terrific swan song) and house detective Bernie Mac (his best non-concert screen outing to date). But a debauched life if not the debauchery will change. The catalyst is a cute bartender (Gilmore Girls Lauren Graham) who crucially equalizes the storys bile with loopy sweetness. Otherwise without peccadilloes she has a nympho thing for Santas which makes her seem positively normal compared with a doughy kid (Brett Kelly) bedeviled by skateboarders who know a weirdo when they see one. Once Thornton befriends him (sort of) these punks are doomed. Some of the movies early going is all attitude without wit but you can feel every acting principal starting to rock (led by brilliant Billy Bob) maybe 15 minutes in as Zwigoff gains command. This is a filmmaker who instinctively knows that a shot of Santa sitting at a bar as Ricky Nelson sings Jingle Bells will be no-frills funny. The pandering fart-joke crudeness of The Cat in the Hat posing as family fare is 50 times more offensive than almost anything in this movie candidly billed as ""bad."" For those on its wavelength there couldnt be a better gift than Santa. (Opens nationwide Wednesday. R pervasive language strong sexual content and some violence.)

"A Bad Santa? Well bless his Grinchy little heart - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEW A Bad Santa? Well bless his Grinchy little heartIts not a tale for the kiddies but cynics might get a kick out of this comedy about a rancorous department store Santa who turns the tables on commercial America.November 26 2003|Manohla Dargis | Times Staff Writer ""Bad Santa"" is a Christmas movie that Lenny Bruce could love. A comedy about a full-time cynic who works as a part-time department store Santa this is a superb stink bomb of an entertainment generously larded with jokes about alcoholics short people dim children and the kind of sexual congress that until recently was illegal in nine states. If the film were sent out as a screener I wouldnt ship it off to the relatives -- I would fire it up again on Dec. 25 and bask in the glow of its obdurate Grinchitude.""Bad Santa"" doesnt just skewer the sacred cow known as the department store Santa -- it slices and dices it into thick juicy chunks then tosses the pieces on a roaring flame. Billy Bob Thornton plays Willie T. Stokes an unreconstructed boozehound chain smoker and serial philanderer who subsists on gallons of whiskey and an occasional fried baloney sandwich. A one-man Saturnalia Willie spends most of the year perfecting his down-and-dirty naughty act before donning a threadbare red suit and a beard as white as week-old snow for his annual Santa stint. Once ensconced in a new gig Willie and his elf-playing partner Marcus (Tony Cox) shimmy past the department store security system so they can carry off sacks of purloined presents and loot.Written with malicious wit by John Requa and Glenn Ficarra (the pair lent a hand to the new ""Looney Tunes"" comedy) the films story originated with executive producers Joel and Ethan Coen whose acid humor and unsentimentalism dovetail seamlessly with director Terry Zwigoffs sad-sack deadpan. Best known for the documentary ""Crumb"" and his splenetic coming-of-age story ""Ghost World"" Zwigoff doesnt possess the Coens pop zip and zing -- his indifferent visual style makes that case plainly enough -- but he has a hard-to-fake dolorous vibe you could cut with a knife. And as he proved with Thora Birch and Scarlett Johannson in ""Ghost World"" and proves again here with Thornton Zwigoff has a talent for helping actors deliver empathetic performances that dont compromise or soften their characters.Thornton his rubbery features usually swirled in a soft-serve sneer plays Willie with uncompromising rancor. Although a no-account father stalks his memory Willie is essentially bereft of psychological and historical exegesis. A man whose talent for expletives would give Dr. Dre pause he lives to drink and drinks to live a commitment that takes surprisingly little toll on his other passion -- bedding sometimes while inside a changing room in the ""Three Times a Lady"" department every woman he can. The idea that Willie can drink this much and play the part of a consummate Casanova is one of the stronger cues that the film doesnt take place in the recognizable here and now but in the gently askew realism familiar from ""Ghost World"" and any number of Coen brothers films.In that world -- one populated by lonely girl geeks comic-book artists freaked-out Vietnam vets and flimflam artists with pencil mustaches -- life doesnt look or play out like a Hollywood movie. In movies like ""Ghost World"" and the underappreciated Coen comedy ""The Big Lebowski"" the characters are outsiders as much by choice as by nature. Exaggerated tweaked to the point of caricature and beyond these characters cant get a hang of the straight world and dont want to even try. For them life is a sad and unrelenting joke which is why they roll with the punch lines with equanimity. The Coens can be sadistic creeps (the death of an asthmatic hit man in ""Intolerable Cruelty"" shows them at their worst) but when a film works as well as ""Lebowski"" it can carry a sting thats truer than most documentaries.""Bad Santa"" isnt as richly conceived as ""Lebowski"" or the less rollicking ""Ghost World"" but like those films it unapologetically exults in its characters glorious imperfection. Its good to know that oddballs outcasts and people who dont look like Barbie and Ken still have a place in American movies and that not everyone in Hollywood pays lip service to the nice and polite. The supporting cast finds its warped groove effortlessly beginning with Cox who as the organizational brains behind the larcenous duo bobs and weaves around Thornton gunning his motor mouth with startling ferocity. For his part Bernie Mac king of the slow burn (a talent Zwigoff immortalizes with a great sight gag) serves a beautifully hostile counterpoint to the late John Ritter whose turn as a put-upon mall manager is a model of comic portraiture.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESWant Christmas with some snark?

"Bad Santa | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; bad-santa ) Bad Santa (United States 2003) A movie review by James Berardinelli Bad Santas Willie (Billy Bob Thornton) is the kind of guy who makes Scrooge look like a generous mild mannered eccentric. With a character as thoroughly unlikable as this you know immediately that Bad Santa is not going to be just another modern-day version of A Christmas Carol. It has two modes dark and darker and dares to do some things with the Christmas motif that havent been done since Norman Renes Reckless. Realistically however what else would you expect from a movie directed by Terry Zwigoff (Crumb Ghost World) and executive produced by the Coen Brothers? If youre looking for Christmas cheer figure out when Love Actually is playing. Bad Santa is for anyone who has had enough of Christmas carols artificial goodwill and Its a Wonderful Life. Although its true that the movie manages a happy ending of sorts the filmmakers have their tongues wedged in their cheeks for that final scene of faux optimism and it can certainly be interpreted in more than one way. (Is it real or a fantasy?) The films central figure is Willie a loser who has adopted just about every vice known to man. The only reason he doesnt smoke more is because it would interfere with his drinking. Every Christmas he and his partner a dwarf (Tony Cox) get a job in a mall department store as Santa and his elf. Then on Christmas Eve after the mall has closed they use their insider knowledge of the security system to disable the alarms. Willie who has a background in safe cracking gets them enough loot so that they can live comfortably for the next year. Except this time things are different. Thurman (Brett Kelly) is an 8-year old dweeb who is constantly bullied has no friends and lives by himself (actually he lives with his senile grandmother but thats as good as alone). In need of someone to believe in he inexplicably chooses Willie whom he constantly refers to as ""Santa"" even when Willies drunk out of costume or humping ""Mrs. Santas sister"" (Lauren Graham as a woman with a serious Santa fixation). At first Willie is annoyed with Thurman for hanging around him but upon figuring out how he can use the kid he has a change of heart. Soon hes living in Thurmans house as he prepares for his next robbery. Some will call this movie ""mean spirited"" and theyre probably right. But it is designed to shock. Early in the film we see Santa urinating in his suit and the contempt in which he holds the kids is unsettling. The movie doesnt cop out by reforming Willie either. That might be the perfect approach for a film that contains an ounce of holiday cheer but its not Bad Santa. Yet for all its darkness - or perhaps because of it - Bad Santa is sometimes laugh-aloud hilarious. The humor is offbeat and unconventional but much of it is funny. The fact that theyre laughing through this movie will make some people feel distinctly uncomfortable. Billy Bob Thornton plays Willie like he was born for the role. Bernie Mac is his usual larger-than-life self as a store investigator who has his eye on Willie. Brett Kelly understands what it takes to portray a dork. And Tony Cox proves that Peter Dinklage isnt the only dwarf with an attitude. Mention must be made of John Ritter in his final movie role (the film is dedicated to him). For Ritter this isnt a standout part (hes playing the part of the department store manager who hires Willie) but it will get a fair amount of attention. Bad Santa is definitely not for everyone. If you appreciate movies that dont compromise on their comedic journey into the heart of darkness this is for you. If you howled at Danny DeVitos War of the Roses and think its one of the best comedies to reach theaters in the last 20 years Bad Santa will delight you. But if youre expecting something kinder and gentler theres still time to see Elf. Because ""kind"" and ""gentle"" are two words no one is ever going to use to describe Bad Santa.

Its the jolly icon as a blotto curmudgeon a self-pitying loser fool.Bad Santa which stars Billy Bob Thornton as the cranky Mr. Claus takes that image and works a whole movie around it - a wisecracking exercise of questionable taste in which Willie T. Stokes (that would be Thornton) dons his Santa suit and doles out insults to the startled kiddies on his knee.Of course theres an ulterior motive to his yuletide gig Willie and partner Marcus - a foul-mouthed little person who dresses as one of Santas elves and is played like a human spitball by Tony Cox - rob department stores for a living. Every holiday season the duo enlist as Santa and his pointy-eared sidekick thereby gaining access to the vaults of various bustling emporiums. Willie a safecracker does the drilling while Marcus trolls the aisles with a shopping list of furs and finery supplied by his trash-talking missus (Lauren Tom).Directed by Terry Zwigoff who did such great work with the teen misfits of 2000s Ghost World this black comedy has moments of inspired impertinence but the unpleasantness of its protagonist spills over to the film as a whole. Bad Santa wants to have its crusty attitude and sweet Christmas spirit too. It flames out in a burst of forced hilarity bathroom humor and jokes at the expense of the weight- and height-challenged and just about every mall-crawling consumer in America.Thornton stumbles scowls and sneers with seeming effortlessness and Cox is a bundle of bad manners and nasty mannerisms. Lauren Graham is the frisky barmaid with a Kris Kringle fetish who gets it on with Willie (a relationship that is not remotely credible) while a big chunk of the movie goes to Brett Kelly as a tubby 8-year-old ignored by his family and bullied by his schoolmates.Against Willies better (or worse) instincts the fake Santa and the fat boy form a bond - its the relationship intended to show us Willies underlying humanity. What it really shows is the filmmakers wimpy retreat into phony feel-good endings. And a weak subplot about the store security chief (Bernie Mac) and his Milquetoast boss (John Ritter in his final film role) makes a sloppy dovetail as the car chases and curse words fly.Bad Santa aspires to the devilish crudity and unfettered social commentary of South Park. But Zwigoffs direction lacks the exaggerated cartoonishness necessary. And there simply arent enough laughs in this Christmas comedy - its more like a stocking stuffed with lumps of coal.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.Bad Santa  (out of four stars)Produced by John Cameron Sarah Aubrey and Bob Weinstein; directed by Terry Zwigoff; written by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa; photography by Jamie Anderson; music by David Kitay distributed by Dimension Films/Miramax Films.Running time 1 hour 31 mins.Willie T.

"Holiday feast - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Holiday feastA foul-mouthed -- and funny -- alternative to Christmas cheerNovember 26 2003|By Mark Caro Tribune movie reporter.BAD SANTA (star)(star)(star)1/2You may never hear as much swearing around kids as in ""Bad Santa."" There are some lessons here1. Dont take kids to ""Bad Santa.""2. Dont see ""Bad Santa"" if youre offended by swearing around kids.But for those who can laugh at the profane who miss the toxic bite of early National Lampoon who long for a comedy that would rather offend some than please everyone who now require insulin shots from prolonged exposure to ""Love Actually"" who tire of Christmas cheer being rammed down their throats heres a movie for you.""Bad Santa"" is the foulest holiday movie Ive ever seen -- and the funniest. Contrary to some shrill advance reports the movie doesnt portray Santa as a drunken potty-mouthed incontinent horny suicidal thief. No it portrays a guy who pretends to be Santa as a drunken potty-mouthed incontinent horny suicidal thief. So all of you Santa purists can breathe a sigh of relief and go enjoy Ed Asner in ""Elf"" again.Billy Bob Thornton stars as Willie who spends the year drinking himself into oblivion until the holiday season when he reteams with an even more foul-mouthed black dwarf named Marcus (Tony Cox the memorably ornery little person from ""Me Myself and Irene"") to play a department store Santa and elf. On Christmas Eve the pair rob the store and its safe and then Willie has drinking money for the following year.Thornton has played sad sacks before but none has compared with Willie who kicks off the movie with a hilarious voice-over grumble about his abusive dad and pathetic life (yes the humor is pitch black) and how he got drafted for Vietnam and ""had to spend two years in Mexico for no reason."" He stumbles into an alley in his Santa outfit begins to retch and up comes the title ""Bad Santa.""The Coen brothers executive produced ""Bad Santa"" and their deadpan sensibility is evident. But the movie boasts far more go-for-broke spirit than the Coens own recent comedy ""Intolerable Cruelty"" which felt muted in its effort to reach the mainstream. Its also much sharper than youd expect from ""Cats amp; Dogs"" writers Glenn Ficarra and John Requa.Its bracing to see a comedy that doesnt attempt to soften its characters rough edges. Youre repeatedly appalled at whats coming out of Willies and Marcus mouths and thats fine because humor stems from subverting viewers expectations.One expectation would be for ""Bad Santa"" to look down on Willie (as the Coens often do with their characters) but Thornton never distances himself from him and the movie views him if not sympathetically then at least at eye level. That sensibility is consistent with director Terry Zwigoff whose previous movies were ""Ghost World"" and ""Crumb.""All three movies embrace characters living on the margins so-called losers with anti-social tendencies and idiosyncratic passions. Willie is the mostextreme of these but Zwigoff is making a semi-serious point by spotlighting people otherwise ignored in mainstream films those whose Christmases have more to do with lumps of coal than sugarplum fairies.Thats why ""Bad Santa"" without sentimentality is able to sell you on the eventual bond between Willie and the snot-nosed 8-year-old boy (Brett Kelly) who adopts him as his pal. This picked-on tubby nerd is so clear-eyed and steadfast that he comes to seem heroic.""Bad Santa"" is full of tell-your-friends (but not your kids) kind of lines almost none of which are printable. OK Ill try one Willie and Marcus have been downing shots at a bar and Willie gets annoyed that Marcus doesnt want another round. Marcus shoots him a withering look and retorts ""I weigh 92 pounds you [expletive].""The able supporting cast includes the late John Ritter as a timid mall manager a formidable Bernie Mac as the mall security chief who doesnt miss a trick and Lauren Graham as a Santa-loving bartender.The swearing and drunken stumbling do get a bit repetitive and some of the broad bits toward the end dont work. But ""Bad Santa"" is no gross-out comedy. Its rudeness springs from its characters not gags.Look people who prefer sunny holiday visions have no shortage of options. This movie isnt for them. Meanwhile the anti-sentimentality contingent should find the nasty stench of ""Bad Santa"" to be a breath of fresh air.""Bad Santa""(star)(star)(star) 1/2Directed by Terry Zwigoff; written by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa; photographed by Jamie Anderson; edited by Robert Hoffman; production designed by Sharon Seymour; music by David Kitay; produced by John Cameron Sarah Aubrey Bob Weinstein.

Talent and uniquely dyspeptic mood separate this effort from populist stabs at tasteless yukkage. Film has a definite cult life ahead of it. Immediate theatrical biz may prove short in the general multiplex world. A correction was made to this review on Nov. 23 2003. Somewhere far beyond naughty vs. nice lies ""Bad Santa"" an aggressively profane comedy starring Billy Bob Thornton as a department-store Kris Kringle with booze booty and felony-theft dysfunctions. First-rate talent and a uniquely dyspeptic mood separate this effort from more routine populist stabs at tasteless yukkage such as the Rob Schneider oeuvre. But its nonetheless largely a one-joke concept that -- while sometimes very funny -- will no doubt engender hostile response from many mainstream critics. Dimension Films release has a definite cult life ahead of it. Immediate theatrical biz may prove short in the general multiplex world but longer wherever cynical urban hipsters get tipped to perverse pics appeal. Helmer Terry Zwigoff reportedly wrangled with producers over edits that brought the feature down to a manageable R rating. Whats left will still offend plenty. If the terrific ""Ghost World"" heralded Zwigoff as an exception to the generic jinx on gifted documentarians entering fictive terrain (e.g. Michael Moores ""Canadian Bacon"" Errol Morris ""The Dark Wind"") this follow-up may suggest to some that bad luck just simply skipped a feature -- while others will find ""Santa"" a refreshing gust of ill wind amid formulaic major-studio product. Chopin-scored opening shot sums it up as camera pans down a bar of cheerful yuppie holiday revelers to settle on Santa-suited Willie T. Stokes (Thornton) alone well-lubricated explaining his misanthropic self in dour voiceover. The title graphic arrives just in time to emphasize Willie upchucking in a back-alley. Apparently raised in unpleasant circumstances by a dad who taught him one thing -- how to crack a safe -- Willie survives on proceeds from his annual teaming with three-foot-tall Marcus (Tony Cox). Each Yuletide they take jobs as Santa and his elf-helper gaining access to heavily trafficked stores which they then rob blind after hours on Christmas Eve. Marcus is a natural at the con. But sloppy-alcoholic tail-chasing Willie is a liability. Shamed by his cohorts post-ripoff diatribe this ""bad Santa"" vows hell give up drink and go legit. Fat chance. In Phoenix they get holiday jobs at a mall managed by squeaky-clean Bob (the late John Ritter). This supervisor is immediately discomfited by Willies potty-mouthed randy behavior but despite several outrageous incidents hes afraid to fire the pair for fear of a discrimination lawsuit (re Marcus double-threat status as an African-American ""little person""). Meanwhile Willies ill-tempered inebriated dealings with the children on his lap win him a fan in the ample form of a picked-on plus-sized kid (Brett Kelly) whos being raised by a senile grandma (Cloris Leachman in a nearly silent role). The boy is willing to overlook anything -- even ""Santas"" drunken cuss-mouthed skirt-chasing behavior -- to get some ""paternal"" support. When Willie finds his motel room being rifled by mall security chief Gin (Bernie Mac) he moves into the childs tiny suburban house. Its in the scenes between pasty-faced Kelly and Thornton that ""Bad Santa"" will most polarize aud response. Its not so much that latters eventual dawning of fatherly instinct or their mutual slow-growth bond are unfelt sentimental gambits. Problem is that Thurman (the child his name revealed very late) is so pathetically needy and Willie such a drastically inapt dad figure that their sequences together come off more painful than poignant. The rudeness of language and incident in Glenn Ficarra and John Requas script renders the evolution toward bonding grotesque within pics extreme-comedy context. The comedic content registers erratically reflecting the difficulty in ringing infinite variations on a basic high-contrast between scrubbed middle-class Christmas spirit and the central figures colorful vulgarity. Innumerable over-the-top situations (some no doubt toned down from an earlier NC-17 form) are occasionally hilarious other times just distasteful. Pic lacks the character depth that might render certain sequences (like Willies very public drunken Waterloo at the mall his suicide attempt or the kids self-inflicted accidental knife wound) seriocomically sharp rather than just psychologically bleak. The climactic chase and shootout only heightens that disjunction though an epilogue duly softens matters. No one could have played the lead role better than Thornton though he does little he hasnt before -- this part is essentially a filthier-mouthed version of the misanthrope memorably played in exec producers Joel and Ethan Coens ""The Man Who Wasnt There."" Cox shows considerable flair delivering various rants about Willies lifestyle while Bernie Mac makes the most of his scenes as their nemesis. Lauren Graham offers a game but slippery impression (possibly thwarted by cuts) as a bartender who very much enjoys her sex-play with ""Santa."" Lauren Tom is funny but underused as Marvins materialistic girlfriend. Ritter (to whom the film is dedicated) scores several hysterical reaction shots as the most puritanically appalled audience to both Thornton and Macs beyond-blunt language. Most notable element to design package is a witty soundtrack of incongruous familiar classical themes and chirpsome kitsch holiday tunes. Other contribs are pro but undistinguished.
