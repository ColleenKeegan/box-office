BRING EM ON By Newsweek Staff On 4/18/04 at 800 PM NewsAs I watched ""The Alamo"" John Lee Hancocks ambitious but unsteady epic my thoughts wandered to our beleaguered soldiers in Iraq. This may not be what the filmmakers intended but a war movie in wartime reverberates in ways beyond the control of its makers. And an elegiac war movie in which almost all of the major characters are slaughtered in a losing battle (though Texass war for independence was won soon after) sits queasily at this moment.The mind wanders for other reasons as well. Long stretches of ""The Alamo"" are simply dull. You can see that the screenwriters--Les Bohem Stephen Gaghan and Hancock--were trying for something more complex and historically accurate than John Waynes bloated flag-waving 1960 version. The historical figures are never drawn in simple black and white. Theres the alcoholic but tactically brilliant Sam Houston (Dennis Quaid); Davy Crockett (Billy Bob Thornton) portrayed as a man who stands at an ambivalent remove from his own legend; the debauched charismatic James Bowie (Jason Patric) and his rival for command of the fort William Travis (Patrick Wilson). Each has a flawed humanity.But the movie bites off far more than it can artfully chew. At two hours and 15 minutes ""The Alamo"" feels both interminable and attenuated. There are powerful moments--striking images of the pathos and horror of war--scattered amid the mundane TV-movie dramaturgy but its no secret this was a plagued production subject to severe recutting and major re-shoots. Along the way not just the storytelling but the original intention has gotten muddled. You leave ""The Alamo"" uncertain of what youre meant to feel is this a celebration of patriotic sacrifice or an illustration of wars futility? Like the debate on our Mideast morass there will be no agreement on the answer.

In 1836 Texas was part of Mexico but sought independence so Mexican general Santa Anna marched with thousands of uniformed men to put down the raggle-taggle band of rebels making their stand in a strategic fortress The Alamo. The Texians (as they were then called) held out heroically before being wiped out by superior numbers the names of knife-wielding Jim Bowie (Jason Patric) and pioneer-turned-politician Davy Crockett (Billy Bob Thornton) passing into folklore along the way.Its the process of myth-making that interests director Hancock as he shows Crockett struggling to live up to an inflated legend and the ailing Bowie as a shadow of the fearsome stories about him. Other pointed details include the black servants planning to defect to the Mexicans whove already abolished slavery and the prevarication of Texian leader Sam Houston (Dennis Quaid) who could have sent reinforcements but feared possible defeat would hamper his political ambitions. That said its not quite a fully revisionist affair since Santa Annas portrayed as an over-brocaded megalomaniac and the film cant leave us without an audience-friendly upbeat coda. Nor is it as compellingly told as youd hope adopting the lugubrious pacing maudlin Celtic-tinged music and epistolary voiceovers beloved of TV documentarist Ken Burns to ultimately deadening effect. Still theres a certain ambition and complexity while Billy Bobs Crockett a self-doubting frontier raconteur with the Paganini touch on the fiddle is a truly memorable creation.

As frontiersman Davy Crockett (though he prefers David) Thornton gives the movie a much-needed spark; he makes all his lines funny even though theyre not. ""Were going to need more men"" he says seeing the massive Mexican army advancing on the Alamo and something about his flat-voiced laconic delivery -- or maybe his face etched with squiggly squint lines and looking ever-so-slightly perplexed like hes pondering a difficult math problem -- gives it a comic spin. Its yet another terrific oddball character turn for Thorntons resume and its heaven-sent ""The Alamo"" otherwise suffers from good intentions but tepid results. Movie review Showtimes and trailer  ""The Alamo"" with Dennis Quaid Billy Bob Thornton Jason Patric Patrick Wilson Emilio Echevarria Jordi Molla. Directed by John Lee Hancock from a screenplay by Leslie Bohem Stephen Gaghan and Hancock. 135 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sustained intense battle sequences. Several theaters. Blame the screenplay which spent years in development (three writers are credited; others such as John Sayles are known to have worked on it) and has a definite made-by-committee feel to it. Hancock except for some occasional sputters (mostly from Thornton) never succeeds in bringing history to life. The film plods along like those Mexican soldiers arriving at its destination in serviceable yet unmemorable fashion. The familiar story of the doomed Texas settlement is here centered on three men all members of the Alamo troops William Travis (Patrick Wilson) the young commanding officer; James Bowie (Jason Patric) a popular colonel suffering from a terminal disease; and Crockett who is dismayed to find that he has arrived at the Alamo just in time for trouble. (""I understood the fighting was over"" he says the grin freezing on his suddenly immobile face. ""Aint it?"") Though Dennis Quaid Hancocks star in ""The Rookie"" has top billing hes really barely in the movie as Gen. Sam Houston racking up just enough screen time to show off his muttonchop sideburns and bookend the story. Patric does his manly best with an oddly written character; Bowie seems to alternate between energetically whipping out his huge namesake knife and coughing into a blood-stained handkerchief like a frontier Camille. Wilson so good in HBOs ""Angels in America"" is a tad miscast; though Travis is described as a dandy Wilson looks almost too refined here striding around in his custom-made blue coat like a stern peacock among drab hens. The two men are scripted as polar opposites who come to an understanding on Bowies sickbed (he gets multiple death scenes surely any actors dream) -- it may be history but its too meticulous to be believable. Hancocks movie is rich in color and period detail (theres a gorgeous shot of the Mexican army their red-and-gold uniforms glowing through fields of gray-white snow) and its never unwatchable. But you get the sense that its been jiggered with a few too many times and you just keep wanting more of Crockett a man both shaped and amused by his own myth (he wears a coonskin cap he says because ""that feller in the play"" wears one). The film ends on an elegant shot of the Alamo as the evening light fades and on one last peek at Thorntons leathered face as he gazes into the waning sun as if hes been mysteriously resurrected -- or as if the filmmakers realized too late that he was the movie.

(AP Photo/Van ... more Photo VAN REDIN Only Thornton emerges unscathed in The Alamo 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Alamo Action drama. Starring Billy Bob Thornton Dennis Quaid Jason Patric Patrick Wilson. Directed by John Lee Hancock. Written by Hancock Leslie Bohem Stephen Gaghan. (PG-13. 135 minutes. At Bay Area theaters). The brave men who fought and perished at the Alamo believed fervently in their cause. For ""The Alamo"" to work the audience must believe as well. That never really happens. Impressively staged ""The Alamo"" features a fine performance by Billy Bob Thornton as Davy Crockett the Tennessee congressman and outdoorsman who fought alongside the severely outnumbered Texas rebels during a 13-day standoff in 1836. The movie also embraces every man at the Alamo not just the Anglos. But it lacks historical context offers some lackluster performances and makes a cartoonish villain of Generalissimo Santa Anna of Mexico. In the end ""The Alamo"" is a valiant but losing effort. The picture starts by surveying a landscape of dead bodies scattered across the former mission turned fortress. There goes any suspense for people unfamiliar with the story. Director John Lee Hancock (""The Rookie"") and his co-writers Leslie Bohem and Stephen Gaghan aim to establish the human drama as more crucial than the outcome but they fail to provide enough characters to root for. ""The Alamo"" hangs its story on four conflicted men Crockett; Gen. Sam Houston (Dennis Quaid); Lt. Col. William Travis (Patrick Wilson) commander of regular forces; and Jim Bowie (Jason Patric) the adventurer and militia leader. John Waynes 1960 ""The Alamo"" adopted a similar strategy but also fleshed out minor characters which this version fails to do. In the new ""Alamo"" only Thornton merits true audience identification. It might seem too obvious to have sly ol devil Thornton play sly ol devil Crockett but the gravity of his performance tells us that Crockett is the only fighter aware of the stakes. The writers have supplied him with plenty of one-liners but Thornton also delivers the movies only truly chilling moment when Crockett tells a fireside story about a battle with a band of Indians. Director Hancock recognizes Thornton as the films emotional center composing shots of the actor as if he were Errol Flynn in a swashbuckling film. A scene where Crockett silences the Mexican armys drums with his fiddle carries a visceral if hokey charge. Lit from behind by pink sky Thornton symbolizes the individual against the machine. As the general aware he is sacrificing the Alamo for a bigger (and ultimately successful) fight against Santa Anna Quaid acts mainly through the crease between his eyes. At times it is as deep as the Rio Grande. Wilson so poignant as the gay Mormon in HBOs ""Angels in America"" has great screen presence but is saddled with a vain and obstinate character. In this version of the battles first strike the petulant Travis fires a cannon because he is peeved at Bowie for trying to broker a truce. The weakest link is Patric his jaw as steely as the giant knife his character wields. The actor seems incapable of summoning the vulnerability required to play Bowie who spends most of the battle in bed with consumption. Spanish actor Jordi Molla gives Patric a run for his money in the smolder department as Capt. Juan Seguin leader of the Latino Texan contingent fighting Santa Anna but he is denied sufficient screen time. Re-creating the Alamo in the Texas hill country the film captures the physical dimensions of an impossible task. Shot from above the crumbling old mission looks defeated before the fighting starts. Long shots of the sharply outfitted Mexicans marching in line lend a thrill of anticipation but also a sense of impending doom. Armed with pinpoint marksmanship and foolhardy courage the Texans can pick off Mexican soldiers but they can hardly stem the tide. The nighttime battle scenes are glorious in their simplicity. Apart from a fiery cannonball hurtling a little too artfully through the air Hancock resists special effects. He also forgoes the carnage popular in battle scenes since ""Braveheart."" The hand-to-hand combat is intense without being gruesome. Questions about the rebels motivation nag throughout. In an early scene between Crockett and Houston set in Washington D.C. the Texan urges the Tennessean to come to his neck of the woods where militia service will buy ample land. Without any information about how the settlers got there all we glean is that these men were exercising their God-given right to take others land and not be messed with. To bridge the storytelling gap the filmmakers offer the stock character of Santa Anna. Clad in full Napoleonic gear Mexican actor Emilio Echevarria camps it up as the dictator licking his lips as Santa Anna contemplates killing. This dandy dines on fine china while the bullets fly and procures a comely local lass for his pleasure. Its Santa Anna as filtered through Saddam Hussein. Nobody ever claimed Santa Anna was a sweetheart but was his cause less righteous than the Texans? Having won its independence a little over a decade before Mexico would naturally try to defend itself from interlopers. As a fellow Latino Texan tells Seguin in the movie ""Santa Anna only wants to rule Mexico. These (Alamo fighters) want the whole world."" A story about manifest destiny is tricky to pull off in the current sociopolitical climate especially when the filmmakers take pains to deliver a more balanced (and accurate) account of the famous uprising. ""The Alamo"" covers all the bases but in doing so dilutes its message of sacrifice for a greater good. The movie touches on one of the Texans less-heralded causes the defense of slavery. The filmmakers seem to want it both ways trumpeting the bravery of the fighters at the Alamo while acknowledging that not every man was there of his free will. The vast majority of the ragtag fighters didnt hold slaves of course but the knowledge that some of them did cant help but color the efforts of all. When Bowie releases his own slave you cheer the mans freedom not his masters deathbed generosity. Advisory This film contains violence and raw language.

The torch is passed -- when its not igniting a cannon. (Related video Watch a clip from The Alamo) Patrick Wilson Billy Bob Thornton and Jason Patric lead the Texans into a losing battle at The Alamo. Touchstone Pictures What sets the new version apart is its subordination of myth plus a somewhat stronger emphasis on the battles motivating Tex-Mex politics and on the character flaws of certain famed participants. The womanizing of Col. William Travis (Angels in Americas Patrick Wilson) gets its first screen treatment outside of previous and plentiful Alamo documentaries. And Jason Patrics Jim Bowie dying of consumption is Jim Boozy. The intentions arent to debunk but to humanize. Its ironic then that the movie seems human only when Billy Bob Thorntons heavily homespun Crockett is on screen or when Amores Perros Emilio Echevarria (instantly memorable as Tex-nemesis Generalissimo Antonio Miguel Lopez de Santa Anna) explodes at subordinates. Thornton is excellent and now seems genetically incapable of being anything less than great in any role he takes. Bring on Frances King Louis XVI. ABOUT THE MOVIE The Alamo  1/2 (out of four) Stars Dennis Quaid Billy Bob Thornton Jason Patric Patrick Wilson Emilio Echevarria Director John Lee Hancock Distributor Touchstone Rating PG-13 for sustained intense battle sequences Opens Friday nationwide The Alamo has had a tough history. Original director Ron Howard left the project and a Christmas release was scrapped after replacement John Lee Hancock needed more time to assemble footage. In 2002s The Rookie Hancock elicited an emotional jolt from a shot of Jose Cansecos jersey so you expect more emotion and grandeur here. Instead the movie is a mild compeller for history buffs and occasionally its better than that. But the teenage mall rats on whom box office success largely depends are more likely to zoom away in Alamo rental cars. Interestingly three of the movies best scenes (including one with Dennis Quaids glorified cameo as Sam Houston) occur afterthe Alamo falls. Also interesting but not in a good way is that the final charge is not particularly effective. Poor filmmakers They try to be true to history by staging the battle in the predawn darkness whereas John Waynes often windy and inaccurate version transformed it to daytime. Partly because we could actually see what was going on Wayne got one of the greatest action scenes in movie history -- Kurosawa-caliber in fact. Its a tough call but sometimes theres something to be said for myth.

"Disneys ahistoric Alamo. Slate Sign In Sign Up Disneys ahistoric Alamo. Disneys ahistoric Alamo. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.April 8 2004 509 PM Remember the Alamo? Disney doesnt. This is the Texas battles most confused treatment yet. By David Edelstein A Texian mishmash The director of the new Alamo movie--a Lone Star native with the revolutionary moniker of John Lee Hancock--has said that he wanted to make the definitive story of the fabled Texas last stand not like that fat hunk of myth-making propaganda fashioned by John Wayne in 1960 at the apex of the Cold War. Its true that the rah-rah jingoism of Waynes version is nowhere to be found in Hancocks. This is a careful and reasonably nuanced retelling its canvas broad its heroes imperfect its key minor--at times even dirgelike in a post-9/11 sort of way. (The movie opens with the bodies of Alamo and Mexican soldiers.) For a big-budget epic from a studio that isnt known for its historical (or artistic) revisionism this is a very respectable effort. But the absence of politics is a kind of politics too and Hancocks The Alamo is likely to leave people scratching their heads and wondering ""Whats the back story here?"" This is a profoundly ahistoric movie--a definitive Hollywood muddle. Advertisement Over the years many historians have respectfully suggested that the defense of this modest crumbling San Antonio mission in the absence of an influx of norteamericano troops might not have been the wisest course for Col. Jim Bowie and Lt. Col. William Travis. The gringos had a couple of months notice that the Mexican general Santa Anna was on the move with thousands of men Maybe Bowie and Travis should have burned down the place (never much use as a fortress to begin with) and lived to fight another day. (That was the directive of Gen. Sam Houston the commander of the Texas Army.) Its no secret that their motives werent entirely pure either. A large number of (non-Chomskyite) writers have suggested that U.S. rebels were trying to pull off something of a land grab at a time when Mexico had only just won its freedom from Spain. That was certainly consistent with Bowies past In his youth hed been one of the new countrys most audacious real-estate swindlers a man for whom Manifest Destiny meant concocting bogus claims for hundreds of thousands of acres. He moved westward to stay ahead of the government and his creditors--as did Travis who beat it out of Alabama leaving a wife and kids behind. But theres no denying the valor of these Texians (as they were called) who fought and died in the 13-day siege and became part of our folklore. As well as our 28th state the Alamo gave us two archetypes Bowie whose big knife had once cut the heart out of a man in the act of shooting and stabbing him; and Davy Crockett the Tennessee bear-hunter turned politician turned folksy raconteur. In this new telling (the script is credited to Leslie Bohem Stephen Gaghan and Hancock) the story of the Alamo is one of those quintessential American myths of ragtag underdogs outmanned and outgunned holding their own against a large better equipped and sadistic foe. The sadists in this case arent the ordinary Mexican soldiers portrayed as just doing their duty but their leader Santa Anna played by the Mexican actor Emilio Echevarria (best known here for his role as a bedraggled dog-loving hit man in Amores Perros [2000]) as a cigar-smoking voluptuary who relishes the execution of his prisoners He announces that to let any of them live would be seen as the workings of fate whereas wholesale slaughter will be seen as the workings of Santa Anna. The real Alamo fighters knew of Santa Annas approach for quite a while but in the movie its presented as a rude shock--most of all to Crockett (Billy Bob Thornton) who enlisted in the Texas militia to revitalize his political career and hadnt figured on being at the wrong end of a siege. This is a little unfair to the actual man who stuck around for months in San Antonio but its the best part of The Alamo--this conception of Crockett as a semi-fraud trapped by his own mythic persona who rises to the occasion and fulfills his destiny. It gives Thornton a chance to be the anti-John Wayne dryly funny in his modesty a natural politician and unnatural man of action. Thorntons gregarious warmth helps bolster Patrick Wilsons fine but low-key Travis whos hobbled by a patchy script and Jason Patrics fine but even lower-key Bowie whos less swaggering than the occasion warrants. (Its a wonder that his men can even hear him.) Dennis Quaid has much worse luck as Houston. A raging alcoholic (the Cherokee referred to him as ""Big Drunk"") who refused to take seriously Travis pleading missives from the midst of the siege Houston could easily be the other villain of the piece; and neither Hancock nor Quaid seem to know what to do with him. Quaid drops his voice pops his eyes and looks like a man who hasnt moved his bowels in months. When Houston gets the news of the Alamo disaster he prays like the guilt-ridden king in Becket (1964) then comes back to life as an avenger styling himself the Wellington to Santa Annas Napoleon. This is meant as his redemption--and the movies since Hollywood depictions of disasters like the Alamo and Pearl Harbor must end for commercial reasons with Americans getting their own back. Americans did of course They got Texas which Santa Anna signed over in return for his life earning everlasting disgrace in his native country. (It would become a U.S. state in 1845.) But thanks to Hancocks evasive storytelling its never clear why Houston moved so slowly or why so few Texians came to the Alamos aid. The middle of the movie is pokey and unfocused--and given the circumstances bizarrely lacking in urgency. There was a fair amount of subterfuge in how the messengers got out but Hancock seems stuck on Bowie slowly expiring from typhoid. The direction gives you time to ruminate on the dumb Hollywood touches like the scene in which Travis petulantly fires his cannon at the Mexicans while Bowie is in the middle of a white-flag negotiation--a moronic act of insubordination if it happened. (It didnt.) And while dubious legend has Crockett narrowly missing the popinjay Santa Anna with his rifle Hancock has him showing off by shooting an epaulet off the generals uniform. You think ""Why didnt he aim for the heart and end the whole thing right there?"" Crocketts last scene is certainly novel Its so heroically wiseass that youll wonder why you never heard about it until now (three guesses). Carter Burwells score is disappointingly James Hornerish (conventionally romantic with Celtic pipes) but it has one moment of sublimity the stirring low brass and drums as the Americans lie sleeping and the Mexicans begin their surprise approach. That music supplies the mythic dread thats absent from the rest of the picture despite Dean Semlers blue-lit mists and Michael Corenbliths expressive rubble. Hancock--best known for scripting A Perfect World (1993) and Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (1997) and for directing the baseball inspirational The Rookie (2002)--stages battles with the skill of a competent Confederate re-enacter but in a movie like The Alamo you hope for a little more horror at the waste of so many lives. Hancock does make gestures toward social realism The presence of slaves at the Alamo is finally acknowledged and one scornfully advises another not to die for as well as clean up after the white man. (The political correctness is undermined by the clunky dialogue which definitely pegs these two as ""Negro"" bit players.) As the tejano leader Juan Seguin Jordi Molla ponders the significance of fighting against his own Mexican brother but the only thing that carries the scene is the actors charismatic stillness. What I took away from this Alamo is that nothing motivates us like revenge. When we remember the Alamo we dont remember the reasons we shouldnt have fought or the lives that were needlessly lost. We remember the galvanizing power of martyrdom. We remember that people especially Americans often never know quite how they feel about something until they feel mad as hell about it.

(CNN) -- ""The Alamo"" is not only a brilliant epic its also that rare breed an epic thats also a character study -- in this case of the men who fought and died at a battle that changed the history of the United States. The film sweeps you back to the spring of 1836 when the huge territory we now know as Texas was part of Mexico and ruled by the Mexican dictator Gen. Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna (played by Emilio Echevarria). But other men had other ideas for the future of an independent Texas. They included Gen. Sam Houston (Dennis Quaid) and an army of hundreds of like-minded ordinary men.The battle of the Alamo was a major turning point in gaining that independence but the events surrounding that bloody conflict have been turned into mythology. This film expertly directed by John Lee Hancock tries to separate the myth from the facts and humanize the handful of men who died at that tiny outpost while fighting against thousands of highly trained Mexican soldiers.In history and in legend three men stand out Lt. Col. William Travis (Patrick Wilson) James Bowie (Jason Patric) and David (or as we know him now ""Davy"") Crockett (Billy Bob Thornton). Travis was a brash young military officer suddenly left in charge of the Alamo while the others -- especially Crockett -- were already living legends.In reality the men who fought at the Alamo were a motley group of soldiers farmers lawyers tradesmen cowboys and even a few black slaves fighting at the sides of their masters. All were there for different reasons and many actually disliked each other. But for 13 days they fought off Santa Annas entire army and became immortalized.Hearts and souls Billy Bob Thornton as David ""Davy"" Crockett gives a marvelous performance says Clinton.There have been more than a dozen films made about the Alamo over the years but none has captured the hearts and souls of the people there better than this one. Hancock gives his main characters -- and some minor ones -- moments that flesh out their backgrounds their flaws and their strengths. He lets the audience connect to characters in an emotional way that many epic adventure films never do.As usual Thornton as Crockett is a standout. His David (apparently the real Crockett hated the nickname ""Davy"") is a man not a myth and at one point says ""If it was just simple ol David from Tennessee I might drop over that wall and take my chances. But that Davy Crockett fellow theyre all watching him."" Thornton also has a nifty exit line.Patric is terrific as Bowie though in the film -- as in history -- he spends most of the battle dying slowly from consumption.Excellence all around Clinton calls Wilson ""the real surprise"" in praising his performance as Lt. Col. William Travis.But Wilson is the real surprise here. Best known for his work on Broadway -- he was nominated for Tony Awards for both ""The Full Monty"" and a recent revival of ""Oklahoma"" -- Wilson also appeared in the award-winning HBO production of ""Angels In America."" ""The Alamo"" is the first chance hes had to strut his stuff on the big screen and his character goes through the greatest changes as he rises to the challenge of a command for which he was ill-prepared. At one point Bowie says to Travis ""You live five more years you just might be a great man."" To which Travis replies ""I think I will probably have to settle for what I am right now.""In addition to the way the now-mythic characters are brought down to a human level the best thing about this production of ""The Alamo"" is that Hancock has made everything look and feel so authentic. And while the final battle is shot in epic proportions he doesnt use every computer-generated trick in the book -- as so many directors are so fond of these days -- to make his point.""Remember the Alamo"" is one of the great battle cries in American history. This film brings home the point that freedom and liberty come with a price and at times great sacrifice -- lessons needed as much today as they were then.""The Alamo"" opens nationwide on Friday April 9 and is rated PG-13.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for 1.99 Review Perfect Man fatally flawed CNN/Money What TVs most popular dads earn Poll Most prefer to watch movies at home Cruise Holmes engaged to marryCNN/Money Security alert issued for 40 million credit cards Bin Laden deputy sends message U.S. House votes to keep U.N. dues Iran poll to go to run-off ALL AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE DC FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY International Edition Languages --------- Arabic German Japanese Korean Turkish CNN TV CNN International Headline News Transcripts Advertise With Us About Us SEARCH The Web CNN.com (c) 2005 Cable News Network LP LLLP.

Refreshingly revisionist impressively produced action epic delivers a less glorified rendition of the famous tale. Given its lack of inspirational hype B.O. prospects look middling. Turning its back on the patriotic and legend-enhancing motivations of John Wayne and others who have put on a coonskin cap this new version of ""The Alamo"" is a historically credible but overly prosaic account of the most celebrated episode in the creation of an Americanized Texas. Refreshingly revisionist in the sense that it takes a relatively clear-eyed view of the messy lives and equivocal circumstances of many of the key participants impressively produced action epic delivers a more truthful less glorified rendition of the famous tale of a few stalwarts who held out for 13 days against an overwhelming Mexican army. Given its generally somber mood and admirable lack of inspirational hype B.O. prospects look middling rather than large which is what Disney would need to recoup its hefty investment. As has been amply reported this ""Alamo"" was the film on which director Ron Howard and Russell Crowe planned to reteam after ""A Beautiful Mind"" only to walk after Disney balked at the projected 130 million pricetag and R rating. Director John Lee Hancock took over on a significantly reduced budget but overages at least partly incurred by pics delay -- and additional post-production in the wake of a canceled Christmas release -- are said to have brought the cost north of the 100 million mark after all. Whatever else can be said of it the picture does convey a tangible sense of what it must have been like to be cooped up in a tiny compound while being bombarded by cannonfire over nearly two weeks of sleepless nights. Whether or not this constitutes entertainment value will vary from viewer to viewer but much of the films merit rests in its logistical and political clarity the care it takes to explain why the principals have traveled to Texas from the East and whats at stake between the Mexicans and the ""Texians"" as the rebels are called here. But as edifying as it is to learn the specifics of how and why such luminaries as Davy Crockett Jim Bowie William Travis and Sam Houston ended up duking it out with Gen. Santa Anna in the late winter and early spring of 1836 the dramatization is initially as dry and brittle as old parchment. After a grim prologue depicting the aftermath of the central battle action shifts to Washington D.C. a year earlier with Tennessee politicians Crockett (Billy Bob Thornton) and Houston (Dennis Quaid) comparing notes at a fancy dress gathering. Expository reels emphasize how Texas then a part of Mexico with a majority Anglo population drawn by generous land offers repped a second chance for many men anxious to reinvent themselves after career setbacks and/or personal tragedies. Already legendary for Indian fighting and hunting the personable Crockett went West after losing a re-election bid to Congress; Bowie (Jason Patric) a brawler known for his outsized knife was in declining health after the death of his wife; Houston a former governor of Tennessee was a habitual drunk and unreliable militia leader; and the youthful Lt. Col. Travis was saddled with the responsibility of defending the Alamo after walking out on his wife and two children. And while Santa Anna (Emilio Echevarria) is portrayed as an imperious dictator a self-styled ""Napoleon of the West"" he is also supplied with plausible reasons for his give-no-quarter approach to battle; with one of his generals having recently been humiliated by the Texians and unrest stirring the leader is intent upon reconfirming Mexican primacy over the English-speaking ""lowlifes"" as one onlooker refers to them. Among the more engaging early scenes in the much worked-over script by Leslie Bohem Stephen Gaghan and Hancock -- if anything remains of the first version John Sayles prepared for Howard it goes uncredited -- there is a power struggle for command of the sequestered troops between Bowie and the untested Travis; a political scene in which Houston is found wanting by colleagues trying to forge a Republic in the territory and some amusing interchanges in which Crockett and Bowie poke and prod one another as they try to separate truth from legend in their lives. But once Travis eliminates any doubt about his intention to defend the Alamo with 189 men against Santa Annas roughly 2500 soldiers the film along with the combatants settles into a somewhat monotonous holding pattern marked by nocturnal explosions minor skirmishes and anxious waiting to see if reinforcements will ever arrive. To rattle the settlers nerves the Mexican repeatedly play a cavalry ditty called ""Deguello"" (Slit Throat) to remind them of their impending doom and in a way the treatment of this tune sums up the films pros and cons. For John Waynes windy ahistorical but genial 1960 version of the story the director-star rejected the song as too banal and unattractive and substituted the hauntingly beautiful alternate Dimitri Tiomkin had written for Howard Hawks ""Rio Bravo"" the year before which imbued his picture with strong emotional resonance. The actual tune as heard here is indeed annoying but the filmmakers have turned this to their advantage in a charming scene in which Crockett already established as an accomplished fiddler provides his own imaginative accompaniment to the piece in a vigorous rooftop improvisation an interlude that ultimately lends the film a poetic coda. A more pronounced instance of how fidelity to history bogs down the proceedings involves Bowie who by all accounts was so beset with consumption he was bedridden throughout the siege; so he remains here to dull effect. On the 13th day Santa Anna launched an all-out pre-dawn assault (accurately portrayed unlike Waynes film which showed the attack as taking place in the dark). Staged with clarity as to strategy and event the actual 90-minute battle takes 12 minutes onscreen and while there is an extraordinary amount of shooting bayoneting and stabbing the amount of blood seen is tiny by contempo feature standards. But the best of this ""Alamo"" is saved for the end. Again unlike Waynes version which almost unaccountably ended with the heroes defeat without explaining the aftermath Hancock and his collaborators offer a bracing delineation of how over the following weeks Santa Anna pursued Houstons men through the wilds fatefully split his army up and was finally surprised taken prisoner and forced to cede all territory north of the Rio Grande in exchange for his life. This climax possesses a sense of anxiety urgency and impending tilt in the balance of history largely missing from the rest of the film. Pic benefits greatly from the rangy and reputedly accurate recreation of the Alamo and surrounding compound overseen by production designer Michael Corenblith not far from Austin. Setting has been employed by Hancock and lenser Dean Semler in a handsome but unselfconscious way although mood of the film is perhaps most set by the weather which blankets the action with a blue-gray overcast most of the time. Carter Burwells score which employs Gaelic-sounding strains is more conventional than much of his work but happily avoids the insistent pounding and point-making of most modern big-picture soundtracks. Performance levels are inconsistent. Thornton makes for an unusually self-deprecating but entirely plausible Crockett bringing a friendly uncloying down-home quality to the most famous defender of the Alamo. Quaid starts off wooden as Houston but delivers in the final 15 minutes when Houston comes into his own in imagining he can outwit Santa Anna as Wellington did Napoleon. Still its the most critical portrayal of a would-be hero in the piece. By contrast Bowie needs more innate wildness nerve and charisma than is provided by Patric who also looks far too robust for a man knocking on heavens door. And more star power would also have been useful for Travis a man-in-the-making for whom Wilson can provide no bottom. Echevarrias Santa Anna and Jordi Molla as Texas native Juan Seguin who allied himself with the Anglos against Santa Anna have their moments.
