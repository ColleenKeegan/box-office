Comments click to enlarge Dope Rated R  103 minutes  2015 A self-described ""black geek"" growing up in Inglewood California must reinvent himself as a gangster when he comes into possession of 100000 worth of narcotics and the rightful owner forces him to sell the stash. Written and directed by Rick Famuyiwa (Brown Sugar) this lively teen comedy recalls early-90s Spike Lee in its hyperactive stylization (theres a different cinematic device in practically every scene) and surfeit of topical issues (the conversations touch on gang violence Bitcoin Americas failed public school system and the revival of 90s hip-hop). The movie is overly ambitious but never dull and the ensemble cast is fun to watch. Much of the energy derives from a constant sense of dread; as a narrator informs us at the beginning these characters could die in a drive-by shooting at any moment.

"Dope | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; dope ) Dope (United States 2015) June 19 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Dope an unconventional coming-of-age story from writer/director Rick Famuyiwa (Our Family Wedding) posits the unlikely proposition of a straight-A student with nearly perfect SAT scores who builds a mini-drug empire as a stepping stone to get into Harvard. Criss-crossing genres like an out-of-control hip hop song Famuyiwa dabbles in the teen sex comedy the urban gangster story and the fish out of water scenario. He gives us suspense gross-out humor a cute romance and a sermon about the status of race in America. Malcolm (Shameik Moore) lives in a single-parent household in the aptly-named ""The Bottoms"" neighborhood of Inglewood California. A self-professed geek Malcolm and his two friends Diggy (Kiersey Clemons) and Jib (Tony Revolori) are ostracized in their school because they would rather do ""white things"" (like get good grades) than hang out with the local gangs. Malcolms goal isnt just to get out of Inglewood but to make it all the way to Harvard - an objective decreed by his guidance counselor as ""arrogant."" Meanwhile the flat topped lover of 80s hip hop falls for Nakia (Zoe Kravitz) the ex-girlfriend of drug dealer Dom (Aap Rocky). This opens the door for him to an odyssey that might have been taken from Martin Scorseses After Hours.  Along the way he meets a roster of odd sexy and/or dangerous characters. They include Lily (Chanel Iman) a girl who despite limited screen time may be the most memorable of Dopes rogues gallery. Whos going to forget her version of ""Mother May I""? (As a kid I played the game once or twice but never like this.) For much of Dope Malcolms story seems like an enactment of Murphys Law at its most sadistic everything that can go wrong to this good kid does go wrong. He goes to a party because he likes a girl and ends up with several bricks of dope (and a gun) hidden in his backpack. He gets seduced by a hot topless girl only to have her vomit on him at an inappropriate moment. He thinks he has found a way out of a bad situation when a phone call scares the life out of him. But Malcolm is inventive and resourceful and figures out a way to turn these things to his advantage. Famuyiwas script is clever in the way it configures these situations. Its also one of the first films to mention things like ""Bitcoins"" and ""the Dark Net"" as more than throw-away terms. Likability is a key here.  The narratives twists and turns are so crazy that its necessary to have a few grounded characters to latch onto.  Malcolm is one. His two friends the butch lesbian Diggy and the dweeb Jib are two others. These three are believable as friends caught in the nexus of something they didnt plan or want. Yet as the saying goes they take the lemons given to them by life and make lemonade. In the end the only chase that really matters is Malcolms pursuit of Harvard. Famuyiwa stumbles a bit late the proceedings with a needlessly preachy video essay provided by Malcolm. The thesis is that a person should be judged by the content of his character not the color of his skin the circumstances of his birth or the location of his home. Just because Malcolm is a black drug dealer living in Inglewood doesnt make him a violent gang-banger with no hopes or dreams. Theres nothing wrong with a social conscience but Dopes coda clumsily and inelegantly restates ideas that have percolated to the surface throughout the entire movie. Famuyiwa doesnt need the speech but because he provides it the net effect is to weaken its impact. Dope received deservedly positive notices when it premiered at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival. Late innings homily aside its a well-acted absorbing story that ranks high both in terms of unpredictability and all-around appeal. The films ability to confound expectations while delivering some big laughs may be its most crowd-pleasing characteristic but the anti-stereotype message rings clear as a bell throughout.

Dope is Go meets Risky Business meets True Romance meets Fingers with a little bit of Boyz N the Hood and We Are the Best thrown in. I doubt all those movies were actually on Famuyiwas mind -- save maybe for Risky Business to which the film directly alludes -- but no matter. Dope wears its referentiality on its sleeve Its a remorselessly entertaining Frankensteins monster of pop-culture borrowings and appropriations. So much so that it becomes very much its own thing. Our hero Malcolm Adekanbi (Shameik Moore pure dorky charisma) raised by a bus-drivingA single mother in the Los Angeles projects known as the Bottoms is a proud geek. His favorite show is Game of Thrones he has his own punk band called Awreeoh (with his best friends Jib and Diggy played by Tony Revolori and Kiersey Clemons) hes applying to Harvard and hes obsessed with 90s hip-hop. His world is a mess of references both retro (2 Live Crew N.W.A Yo MTV Raps) and modern (Bitcoin Twitter etc.). His attempt to carve out a personal style to be himself doesnt sit well with anybody -- not the drug dealers infesting his hood not the jocks who pick on him at school not even his teachers one of whom looks down at Malcolms essay proposal ""A Research Thesis to Discover Ice Cubes Good Day."" (Malcolm is undeterred ""If Neil deGrasse Tyson was writing about Ice Cube this is what itd look like"" he protests.) Malcolms unfortunate series of events kick in when he runs into a drug dealer Dom (AAP Rocky) whos a lot smarter than anyone realizes; he bests Malcolm at classic rap trivia for starters. That puts Malcolm in contact with the beautiful Nakia (Zoe Kravitz) whom Dom also covets but who has more in common with our college-bound hero than she does with her drug-dealer suitor. Their attraction lands Malcolm at a nightclub party which then dissolves into gunfire which in turn leaves him with a book bag full of the drug molly. Long story short (there are many many more twists and turns along the way) Malcolm and his nerd pals find themselves reluctantly forced into selling the drugs. (""Were talking about molly"" one of them offers. ""All we gotta do is find the white people. Go to Coachella."") But what about that Harvard application not to mention the SATs? And the band?A  And the iPad-app-enabled drug dealers chasing them? And what will Nakia think? Dope isnt perfect. Its got a couple too many endings and it loses the romantic subplot for a distressingly long time. To some its breathless referentiality -- the dialogue and soundtrack and imagery a nonstop stream of pop-culture in-jokes and digressions -- may feel inchoate simplistic cheap. But its not the individual references that matter; its the whole crazy patchwork of adolescent longing ambition and fear they weave. Malcolm it could be argued is little more than a collection of influences and tastes -- but nowadays arent we all? As the film tackles everything from celebrity in the age of social media to how Amazons business model relates to the narcotics trade to who can use the N-word and who cant to the double standards that govern academic achievement to the meaning of authenticity in a world governed by prefab expectation it replicates the breakneck speed and whipsawing back-and-forth of modern life. Its an ideal movie for a world where we all dance on the nervous edge between catastrophe and grandiosity. But for all its speed and snark Dope does occasionally settle down and offer up passages of genuine heartfelt beauty. At one point Malcolm boards a bus driven by his mother and dreams of the films various characters -- friends and nemeses alike -- quietly getting on at each stop and gently bopping their heads to Gil Scott-Herons ""Home Is Where the Hatred Is."" If Federico Fellini had directed Superfly he might have come up with a scene like this. God damn I loved this film.

"Rick Famuyiwas Dope starring Shameik Moore reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up A Sly Comedy About Coming of Age as a Young Black Man in America A Sly Comedy About Coming of Age as a Young Black Man in America Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 19 2015 718 AM Boy Hood Dope a sly comedy about a young black mans coming of age. By Dana Stevens Shameik Moore right stars in Dope. Still via Sundance Institute Rick Famuyiwas sly coming-of-age comedy Dope opens with an onscreen dictionary definition of its multivalent title. Depending on the context dope can be an illegal substance sold as a street drug; a person who acts in a foolhardy manner; or a term of praise in black American slang signifying the coolness of the person or thing so designated. All three meanings work in tandem in Dope a movie about a black teenager who foolishly gets mixed up in the sale of an illegal street substance then winds up discovering inner reserves of cool he never knew he possessed. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Malcolm Adekanbi (Shameik Moore) is a high school senior living with his single mom (Kimberly Elise) in the Bottoms a gang-controlled neighborhood in the L.A.-adjacent city of Inglewood. Along with his geeky best buds scrawny Jib (Tony Revolori familiar from his role as Zero the lobby boy in Wes Andersons Grand Budapest Hotel) and butch Diggy (Kiersey Clemons)--who dresses so much like a boy shes generally presumed to be one--Malcolm pursues a set of interests that are to say the least not widespread among the kids at his tough urban high school videocassette tapes of 20-year-old Yo MTV Raps episodes. Punk rock which he writes and plays in a band called Awreeoh (say it out loud) with Diggy and Jib. Malcolm even sports an old-school flat-top haircut and brightly patterned button-down shirts earning him the nickname ""Fresh Prince"" from the schools pack of bullies who regularly hunt him down in the halls to divest him of his vintage sneakers. Malcolm is a good student whos just trying to keep his nose clean until he can get out of the Bottoms and into Harvard (though the schools placement counselor warns him he may be setting his sights a little high). But in the last weeks of senior year he and his buddies get embroiled in a sketchy deal that could turn into an entrepreneurial opportunity--shades of Risky Business a film Famuyiwa has cited as a direct influence. On a whim the three friends crash a wild birthday party for the corner drug dealer Dom (played by the rapper AAP Rocky in a performance that lets the characters vulnerability peek out from beneath the swag.) The police raid the event and Jib Diggy and Malcolm take off in different directions. But the next morning at school Malcolm realizes that someone has stashed a hefty supply of the club drug molly along with a loaded handgun in his nerdy camouflage backpack. Rather than glamorizing the ineffable cool of its hero Dope insists on showing us his fragility and uncertainty. Advertisement All Malcolm wants is to get these dangerous items back in the hands of whomever they belong to as quickly as possible. But that proves to be more difficult than expected. Dom is now in jail and the guy making threatening calls to Malcolms phone may be an FDA agent or he may be the dangerous head of a rival gang. At Doms behest Malcolm and his friends attempt to deliver the stash to the fancy house of a local kingpin. But the only people home are the gangsters two spoiled kids would-be rap producer Jaleel (Quincy Brown) and his bored horny sister Lily (the model Chanel Iman). A couple of very weird hours later Malcolm still in possession of the contraband-stuffed backpack finds himself speeding to his Harvard alumni interview with a half-naked stoned-out-of-her-mind Lily at the wheel while his friends dodge gang-war gunfire at a nearby fast-food joint. The second half of Dope loses some of the openings agreeably daft momentum as the easy camaraderie among its charmingly geeky central trio is undercut by the stoner Burning Man type (Blake Anderson) they enlist to help them market the drugs on the ""dark Web."" Malcolms on-again off-again flirtation with Doms sometime girlfriend (Zoe Kravitz) never quite rises above the level of obligatory plot contrivance. And the scenes with the black Harvard alumnus assigned to vet Malcolm (Roger Guenveur Smith) are a little blunt in pointing up the ironic similarities between Ivy League meritocracy and the ruthless capitalism of the drug trade. But Dopes biggest strength lies in its affectionate and honest portrait of a different kind of young urban blackness than were used to seeing on movie screens. In a flashback early in the film the young Malcolm opens the only gift he ever received from his long-absent Nigerian father--a VHS copy of the movie Superfly identified in an accompanying note as the dads favorite movie. In its subject matter Dope has a lot in common with that blaxploitation classic--both lead the viewer on a perilous trip through the underworld accompanied by super-fly music. (Pharrell Williams wrote Awreeohs original songs in Dope; the soundtrack also pulses with great early-90s hip-hop from groups like Digital Underground and A Tribe Called Quest.) But rather than glamorizing the ineffable cool of its hero Dope insists on showing us the fragility and uncertainty that underlie Malcolms construction of his still-evolving self amid the ever-present threat of danger in his city. In the college application essay that Malcolm struggles to complete between police raids and black-market drug negotiations he paints contrasting pictures of two very different candidates. One is a high-achieving Ivy League-bound black nerd the other a stereotypical fatherless ghetto kid who sells drugs carries a gun and mixes with the wrong sort. It isnt just college admissions committees who too often draw a bright line between those two types of young black man assigning cultural value to one and dismissing the other as a lost cause--its cops teachers juries ordinary citizens and Hollywood movie audiences. Thanks to a witty fast-moving script (also by Famuyiwa) and a sensitive performance from the newcomer Moore Dope helps us see how a young black man coming of age in America faces complications unforeseen by the smugly entitled high schooler played by Tom Cruise all those years ago in Risky Business. Sometimes you do just have to say ""What the fuck?"" and make your move--but business gets a lot riskier when whatever move you make can end up getting you shot.

JULIAN CARRINGTON Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 19 2015 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Jun. 19 2015 1139AM EDT Comments AA Directed by Rick Famuyiwa Written by Rick Famuyiwa Starring Shameik Moore Tony Revolori and Kiersey Clemons Classification 14A Country USA Language English Imagine Risky Business transplanted from Chicagos affluent lily-white suburbs to the black notoriously troubled Inglewood hood known as ""the Bottoms"" and you have the blueprint for Dope.Like Paul Brickmans 1983 satire in which a young Tom Cruise earned acceptance to Princeton by turning his parents home into a brothel the new dramatic comedy from Rick Famuyiwa (The Wood) is the story of Harvard aspirant Malcolm (newcomer Shameik Moore) whose path to the Ivy League takes a vice-world detour. From Black-ish to How to Get Away with Murder to Jane the Virgin the casts of some of todays hits sound off on diversity in television. (Jan. 20) AP Video Video Video Why todays television landscape has more diversity than film Tintin in America the third volume of the Tintin comic-book series by Belgian artist Herge is under scrutiny in Manitoba after a campaign led to its temporary removal from a Chapters bookstore. Multimedia Is Tintin racist? Uproar in Winnipeg opens new chapter in old argument The key distinction between the films - and the crux of Dopes social critique - lies in the differing expectations confronted by their respective leads for well-off white kids like Cruises Joel admission to Princeton is a rite of passage while the Harvard ambitions of the working-class African-American Malcolm are met with accusations of arrogance. Around his way its assumed criminality is less likely a detour than the final destination.Famuyiwa apparently keen to atone for the bonanza of ethnic stereotypes that was 2010s Our Family Wedding here seeks to upend those racialized assumptions. Malcolm along with BFFs Jib (Tony Revolori) and Diggy (Kiersey Clemons) is a self-professed geek and cultivates a passion for what he calls ""white shit"" including ""getting good grades"" and ""Donald Glover.""The trio play in a garage band called Awreeoh and concentrate their appreciation for African-American pop culture on the bright breezy and relatively palatable music and fashions of The Fresh Prince and his early 90s Yo MTV Raps ilk.Like many millennials their throwback-chic personas are the product of the cultural cross-pollination encouraged by the Web and they harbour big dreams. To realize them Malcolm and his friends believe they need to set themselves apart from the tougher elements that have earned Inglewood its up-to-no-good reputation.That proves easier said than done particularly once an encounter with a drug dealer (rapper AAP Rocky) sets in motion a frenetic series of events compelling Malcolm to broker the sale of a stash of MDMA. That Malcolms lack of street smarts is as plain to all as his abundance of book smarts makes this a wildly improbable development illustrative of Dopes loose cartoonish tone.But it also reflects Famuyiwas intent to send up the presumption that all young black men are latent hoodlums. Malcolms underworld entanglements literalize that notion and underscore its absurdity. The added punchline is that Malcolms deep-Web distribution scheme is only made possible through the illicit expertise of a white middle-class hacker friend (Blake Anderson).Like his protagonist Famuyiwa too has profited from his defiance of traditional labels. Dope is about race but it isnt defined by the ethnicities of its director or cast and became the hottest commodity at this years Sundance Film Festival thanks to its crossover appeal.Even as Famuyiwa acknowledges the preconceptions that Malcolms blackness engenders he invites audiences to identify with the character on the basis of his relatable interests aspirations and vulnerabilities. Although it shares a setting with Boyz n the Hood Dope has more in common with Superbad.And then of course theres Risky Business. Just as that film propelled Cruise to stardom Dope promises to be a breakthrough platform for Moore. The young actor even gets an extended opportunity to bust a move. Malcolm may prefer old-school hip-hop to Old Time Rock and Roll but Dope suggests that the divide between hard-knock Inglewood and bougie suburban Illinois is far less fundamental than we perceive.

The crackling comedy ""Dope"" is technically a film about the former but it features a main character with a concrete plan to crack the latter and keep going. More importantly within its ghetto milieu it features a dazzlingly diverse array of character types from drug dealers to Harvard-bred check-cashing tycoons to its main protagonists geeks.Our hero is one such geek named Malcolm (Shameik Moore) railed upon at his inner-city L.A. high school as much for his love of 90s hip-hop culture as for his vocabulary. His Harvard application process is rudely disrupted when by a bizarre chain of events he finds himself mistakenly in possession of a sizeable amount of Ecstasy. With a variety of unsavory claimants to the stash on his back Malcolm takes the riskiest -- but most lucrative -- option and decides to sell the drugs himself. Through an untraceable Internet store of course.With his lively editing innovations eye-popping use of color and 90s hip-hop soundtrack writer-director Rick Famuyiwa cant help drawing comparison to the energy of early Spike Lee. Working with a wonderful ensemble cast led by the exquisitely restrained Moore Famuyiwa paints a broad and loving portrait of one of Americas worst neighborhoods. His film is frequently laugh-out-loud funny but its also bracingly intelligent.Famuyiwa states his thesis a little too bluntly through a monologue Malcolm delivers toward the end but its still a good one even better for the defiance with which Moore reads it and Famuyiwa stages it. When so many black movie characters are simple stereotypes its a pleasure to see a film with real wit about the benefits and pitfalls of playing to and against those expectations.DopeGRADE A-Rated R for language drug content sexuality/nudity and some violence-all involving teensRunning time 115 minutes 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1LiJFjg MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/06/18/movie-review-bracing-witty-dope-tracks-geek-hood/28947337/,200,dope6,dope,detroitnews

This story has been corrected since it was originally published. Malcolm (Shameik Moore) the teenage hero of writer and director Rick Famuyiwas shambling agreeable Sundance hit ""Dope"" is a classic figure straight out of 1990s African-American cinema. Hes growing up in a tough Los Angeles neighborhood (the Bottoms in Inglewood) surrounded by gang violence and drug deals. He has a perfectly sculpted flattop and a collection of pristine Nike footwear at least when the Bloods who persecute him at school dont steal it. He loves Public Enemy A Tribe Called Quest Digital Underground and any number of less famous alt-rap acts. (At one point he and his friends buy the 12-inch single of ""Rock Dis Funky Joint"" by Poor Righteous Teachers - and as white-boy embarrassing as this is I had that record)Except wait - its only the 90s in Malcolms head and in the obsessive yearnings of his band of misfits A teen lesbian named Diggy (Kiersey Clemons) and a guy named Jib (Tony Revolori from ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"") who clearly isnt black but whose precise ethnic origins are never explained. Is he Latino? Is he Arab? And why as white hippie-hacker type Will Sherwood (Blake Anderson of ""Workaholics"") wonders aloud is Jib allowed to say the N-word when Will isnt? Complicated question am I right? And not one everyone will answer in the same way. (Paging Ms. Dolezal) Malcolm says he doesnt care whether Will says that word; Diggy pops him one every time he tries it. Its not that she doesnt like him or thinks hes a bigot. ""Its just instinct"" she shrugs.""Dope"" isnt the perfect movie about the current state of African-American culture or anything and isnt trying to be. It has a goofy shapeless episodic quality that sometimes leads to moments of absurdist comedy and freewheeling brilliance and sometimes gets Famuyiwa mired in recycled cliches. The two beautiful young women who enter Malcolms life during his fateful senior year hard-striving Nakia (Zoe Kravitz the daughter of Lenny) and wild-child Lily (Chanel Iman) are undercooked and disappointing characters. But that hilarious and uncomfortable debate about when or if a non-black person can ever use the forbidden epithet that is used all the time between African-Americans captures why ""Dope"" may be the perfect movie for the summer of 2015.To put it bluntly Malcolm and his friends are hopeless nerds a human subtype that scientists (laboring under their typical cultural bias) long believed did not exist within the African-American community. They get good grades and spend far too many of their Friday nights studying for the SAT. They do not do drugs sell drugs or (embarrassingly) know the first thing about drugs. They have a terrible punk band called Awreeoh (sound it out) that sounds something like Bananarama and whose songs were written by Pharrell Williams the avatar of black-nerd cool. But within this rollicking tale of Malcolms adventures on what he hopes is the path from Inglewood to the Ivy League -- a story that often feels like a Scott Pilgrim comic cross-bred with ""House Party"" and ""Boyz n the Hood"" -- Famuyiwa (previously the director of ""The Wood"" ""Brown Sugar"" and ""Our Family Wedding"") strikes a series of timely and important chords. You Might Also Like In the classic dichotomy of movies about life in the hood Malcolm is a ""good kid"" surrounded by a troubled world. But life is never that simple whether youre in Inglewood or Beverly Hills or Harvard Yard. As Malcolm discovers the scary local drug dealer Dom (played by rapper Aap Rocky) is as much of a 90s music geek as he is and that isnt where the similarities end. No doubt its stretching a point to compare David Simons epic race-and-crime TV drama ""The Wire"" to ""Dope"" which features a viral video campaign for a new street drug known as Lily including the meme-phrases ""People on Lily Be Like"" (that goes with a picture of someone taking a hilarious public pratfall) and ""Howm I Spose to Eat My Pound Cake?"" (that one goes with a gleeful or incredulous face). But they make similar points about the nature of success under capitalism where the distinction between good and evil mostly involves what you can get away with.Heres the news flash embedded in ""Dope"" which isnt news at all but which white American society has great trouble absorbing Black people are not all the same The African-American community is not homogeneous or monolithic and never has been Not only that dividing black people into categories like ""criminals"" and ""people who follow the rules"" is no better than believing that theyre all basically gold-grilled background extras in a Rick Ross video. Having Barack Obama and his family in the White House for the last six years has not produced a ""post-racial society"" God knows but it has thrust the diversity of black life into the nations cultural consciousness in a new way. In ""Dope"" - which as the opening credits remind us can mean a stupid person illegal drugs or total awesomeness - Famuyiwa breaks this down to the individual level. Malcolm doesnt necessarily solve the underlying moral dilemma of ""Dope"" during his eventful senior year - but then he doesnt necessarily solve his virginity problem either. Theres a little bit of Mookie Spike Lees character in ""Do the Right Thing"" in Malcolms observer-participant role and maybe also a little bit of that Prince of Denmark that white dude wrote about that one time. As one of those two guys observed ""there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so."" Thats precisely the conundrum Malcolm explores in his college-application essay spoken aloud to the audience in Famuyiwas most effective frame-breaking moment. Then he does ""The Humpty Dance"" which is dope or possibly fresh - or at any rate provides a delightful ending to an exhilarating ride. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Quincy Brown as Jaleel left Shameik Moore as Malcolm Kiersey Clemons as Diggy and Tony Revolori as Jib in the movie ""Dope."" (Rachel Morrison / Open Road Films) Robert Abele Sundance cred and a Pharrell-produced soundtrack What could be bad? Well actually ... Sundance is some pusher.Arriving on a wave of buzz following its film festival debut ""Dope"" about a trio of Inglewood geeks caught up in a drug heist seems poised to ride its pop culture cachet (music-loving African American nerds or blerds plus a Pharrell-produced soundtrack) to summer indie glory. But ""Dope"" has its own trafficking problem tired stereotypes shallow humor and lip service to the complexities of racial identity and expectation. Writer-director Rick Famuyiwas movie though inspired by his own Inglewood childhood is such a pandering mess it raises the question Whom is this for?Sweet-faced likable newcomer Shameik Moore plays straight-A high schooler Malcolm a self-professed outsider with a high fade who shares a 90s hip-hop obsession with best friends Diggy (Kiersey Clemons) a lesbian tomboy and mixed-race wiseacre Jib (Tony Revolori from ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"") all of whom jam together in a pop-punk band with the punny name Awreeoh. We get it quickly Their tastes (including Walkmen VHS tapes) are winkingly self-aware. But producer Forest Whitaker further explains in narration that Malcolm and his buddies dig ""white"" stuff like skateboards Donald Glover and doing well in school. As for that last proclivity Malcolms got one eye on Harvard and another on a GED-studying neighborhood hottie (Zoe Kravitz) who takes to his smarts. The problem is that shes in the sights of local dealer Dom (rapper ASAP Rocky). Sundance 2015 Dope Earl and the festival of many bets Steven Zeitchik The coming-of-age movie is as natural a sight at Sundance as traffic late-night screenings and James Franco.

The coming-of-age movie is as natural a sight at Sundance as traffic late-night screenings and James Franco. But this year the festival seems to be doubling down on the stuff. As the 2015 edition of the preeminent U.S. film gathering wraps up this weekend the two movies that have emerged as the... (Steven Zeitchik) What sets this story in motion is the fallout from a gun battle at a nightclub which Malcolm survives only to find his backpack full of drugs clearly stashed there by Dom. Trying to return the supply only puts more dangerous types in the trios path and some woefully flat humor in our lap including shootings played for laughs and a ham-fisted sexual encounter with a kingpins quick-to-strip coke fiend daughter (Chanel Iman) that turns into a humiliating social media meme. Read more movie reviews gt;gt;Open link By this point ""Dope"" has moved fast enough through its uninspired set pieces that Malcolms subsequent decision to fight fire with wire by selling the stash online via Bitcoin plays as intended The underdog has turned the tables the smarts have gone street. But the twist bears repeating from a different perspective Famuyiwa took his aspirational geek protagonist and in order to make him an antihero turned him into a drug dealer by the characters own choice.Again whos supposed to be entertained by this turn of events? You can tell Famuyiwa believes his blerdz-n-the-hood coming-of-age adventure will flip worldviews of black teenagers their dreams and their opportunities. Malcolms essay for Harvard spoken at the end as a kind of summation climax ends on an ""if I were white"" construct designed to implicate the just-entertained but which plays only as a phony stab at seriousness. And yet it implies an intended audience that isnt hip to how dimensional portraits of people of color in movies even in deliberately zany ones like ""Dope"" are a continuing problem. ""Dope"" is too high on its own supply of easy questionable comic targets to give a sense of how personal its supposed to be for Famuyiwa. No matter how many nostalgic tracks or insider cultural references he perfumes the air with or larkish Tarantino-esque conversations about thorny issues he has his characters get into (some of which are amusing) ""Dope"" is in the end just another unfunny grab bag of stereotypes.

Dope presents a trio of lovable dorks Malcolm (Shameik Moore) Jib (The Grand Budapest Hotels Tony Revolori) and Diggy (Kiersey Clemons). What do they like doing? Getting good grades listening to classic 90s hip-hop BMX biking and playing in their punk band Oreo (zing). You know Malcolm says ""white stuff."" Writer-director Rick Famuyiwa never quite sends his nerdlings to the slaughterhouse even as they accidentally get involved in a drug deal and the Molly underworld. Instead he doubles down on an applying-to-Harvard satire that both upends demographic expectations while insisting (at times a bit strenuously) that we all aim a little higher. Dope has thrilling moments and flies like Ferris Buellers Day Off but its caustic intelligence glints fast and furious.

Local dope dealer Dom (rapper AAP Rocky) wants to know.And what does Malcolm plan to do with the big bag of valuable street drugs he and his equally geeky pals Jib (Tony Revolori) and Diggy (Kiersey Clemons) have suddenly acquired?Answers Hes a straight ""A"" student with ambition the 90s were ""The Golden Age of Hip-Hop"" and um hes not quite sure.This last response fuels the first half of this Sundance 2015 sensation which unfolds like an urban update to Risky Business an acknowledged influence on writer/director Rick Famuyiwa.Then everything starts to change in ways that make this something of a shaggy Dope story. Famuyiwa who previously wrote Brown Sugar is out to defy genre convention -- this starts as a comedy becomes something else -- and also to make a meaningful statement about what it mean to be young black and struggling in America.A narrative as freewheeling as this one might ordinarily daze and confuse. But Malcolm makes for such a forceful character its easy to go along with whatever direction hes headed in. This includes romantic interest in a girl named Nakia (Zoe Kravitz) who could get him into a lot of trouble. As if he didnt already have enough problems with Dom.The film also finds time to comment on such 21st Century fascinations as YouTube iPhone video (and tracking) and Bitcoin currency.Even when Dope seems to be attempting too much maybe sampling too much of its own stash Malcolms irrepressible spirit draws everything back into focus.The visuals are equally liberated -- camerawoman Rachel Morrison goes in for split screens and odd angles -- and so is the soundtrack. Pharrell Williams tweaks the noise while Public Enemy Digital Underground A Tribe Called Quest and others contribute classic beats. Malcolm and his mates are in a punk trio. Its called Awreeoh which is pronounced Oreo.You didnt expect it to be obvious did you? Dope isnt that kind of movie.

VPCTony Revolori left Kiersey Clemons and Shameik Moore star in Dope.(Photo Rachel Morrison Open Road Films)The fresh haircut and retro outfit of its main character are just a couple of the many dope aspects about Dope (   out of four; rated R; opens Friday nationwide).Newcomer Shameik Moore shines with geeky gusto in a breakthrough role in the coming-of-age comedy/drama which tackles racial stereotypes and 1990s culture as a kind of spiritual descendant of Friday and Do the Right Thing while still featuring a singular voice. Writer/director Rick Famuyiwa includes so much cool stuff however that things tend to get lost in the busy narrative.The spotlight never leaves Moore though. The 20-year-old stars as Malcolm a nerdy African-American teen whose intelligence is as impressive as his gravity-defying high fade. He and his best friends Jib (Tony Revolori) and Diggy (Kiersey Clemons) are made fun of in their rough Los Angeles neighborhood for their penchant for ""white"" stuff -- loving manga skateboards and Donald Glover dont make you cool in a place where around one corner the Bloods are making a YouTube video and the other contains dope dealers ready to jack their bicycles.USA TODAY6 Dope things to know about Shameik MooreMalcolm dreams of attending Harvard but his path begins to change when a chance meeting with a dealer named Dom (rapper AAP Rocky) introduces him to a potential love interest in Nakia (Zoe Kravitz) and a whole lot of trouble when a bunch of cocaine and a gun wind up in Malcolms backpack.The trio of pals then begin an adventuresome romp across L.A. involving a random string of oddballs armed criminals and half-naked women as Malcolm begins to experiment with putting aside his ""good kid"" persona for a change.Dope has an A-list trio of executive producers -- Pharrell Williams Sean Combs and Forest Whitaker who doubles as the movies narrator -- and the film exudes an interesting cross of styles. Amid the modern setting is a soundtrack laden with the 90s hip-hop adored by Malcolms crew whose dress code is Yo MTV Raps chic.As Malcolm Moore seems to have time-traveled out of the period like a cross between Steve Urkel and Big Willie Style-era Will Smith and he exudes a winning charisma on-screen whether hes about to get his virginity taken from him or is explaining to criminals the definition of ""slippery slope.""USA TODAYMe and Earl and the next great love storyFamuyiwas script is smart and edgy when it needs to be When one of his teachers isnt overly pleased with one of his papers Malcolm tells him ""If Neil deGrasse Tyson wrote about Ice Cube this is what itd be like."" The lines are great but the plot becomes convoluted at times with characters coming in and out and seeming more like passersby rather than important supporting players.Kravitzs Nakia inexplicably disappears for a good part of the story -- she has to study for the GED so maybe she was cramming the whole time -- but Blake Anderson skillfully makes up for it as Malcolms hacker buddy who doesnt understand why he cant use the N-word while his other pals can.Dope digs into racial culture in a real way with Malcolm struggling with the fact that he doesnt fit being a geek or a menace to society and its a hoot to root him on as he finds his place somewhere in between. 10 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1MQfRb5",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/06/18/dope-movie-review/28896085/,200,dope12,dope,usatoday

This vibrant film is a bit of a mess but its a beautiful one. Writer-director Rick Famuyiwa (""The Wood"") gives us three unique eccentric fresh adolescent characters who dont feel like the usual teen-movie archetypes -- and then he almost immediately plunges them into shootouts and drug deals that feel crushingly familiar. ""Dope"" clearly wants to mix ""Risky Business"" and the John Hughes oeuvre with the 1990s milieu of ""Boyz n the Hood"" and the many films it inspired. But while theres no reason that combo couldnt work Famuyiwa doesnt quite nail the proportions. See Video New Dope Trailer Reveals Malcolms Harvard Thesis Is About Ice Cube (Video) The 90s are a recurring touchstone here with our heroes Malcolm (Shameik Moore) Diggy (Kiersey Clemons ""Transparent"") and Jib (Tony Revolori ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"") obsessed over the decade and its music and its fashions from their stack of ""Yo MTV Raps"" VHS cassettes to the top of Malcolms Kid n Play hairdo. As narrator Forest Whitaker (who also produced) points out these three are outcasts in their Inglewood high school both for their anachronistic affectations and for their desire to make good grades and go to college. Its in that opening narration where Famuyiwa establishes his go-for-broke intentions toward the films tone Whitaker tells us about another nerdy kid who got shot during a restaurant hold-up and the camera shows the victims bloody GameBoy while Whitaker notes that ironically he was just a few points shy of the high score. Thats a pretty ballsy opening salvo promising a tightrope walk between dark comedy and realistic suffering. Unfortunately ""Dope"" cant maintain that balance. Malcolm is forced to shuttle romantic messages between local drug dealer Dom (rapper AAP Rocky) and his estranged girlfriend Nakia (Zoe Kravitz) eventually becoming smitten with her himself despite the inherent danger involved. Malcolms willingness to go whither Nakia goest eventually lands Malcolm and his friends possession of Doms satchel which holds a large amount of an ecstasy-like drug that seemingly everyone in Inglewood wants. The characters here are too interesting (or at least potentially interesting) to get caught up in yet another bag-of-drugs plot. Diggy for example is a baby butch lesbian whose androgyny confuses men and enchants a series of women while Dom balances cold intelligence a dry wit and a propensity for ruthless violence in the way of the great screen villains. But once ""Dope"" goes off on long tangents explaining how Bitcoin works (its part of how our heroes wind up selling the drugs online) its clear that the movie has somewhat lost its way. Also Read Dope to Become First Movie to Accept Bitcoin for Ticket Purchases (Exclusive) Still Famuyiwa brings such vitality to the production that its hard not to get absorbed even when the storys initial promise gets wrapped up unsatisfactorily -- or rather too satisfactorily with all the complicated and random odds and ends tied up in a neat bow. Tom Cruises character in ""Risky Business"" manages to get into Princeton yes but at least theres still that crack in the Faberge egg. (Side tangent after ""Dope"" and ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" can filmmakers please retire the framing device of the college application essay at least for a while? Its so overused that the trope has become the new ""...and that was the summer that changed everything."") Also Read Me and Earl and the Dying Girl and Dope Could Wake Up Sleepy Indie Box Office If nothing else ""Dope"" is the movie that turned Shameik Moore into a leading man and heres hoping the industry finds more characters this interesting for him to play. Hes charismatic and engaging (I would have loved more scenes between Moore and the underutilized Kimberly Elise who plays Malcolms bus-driver mom) and he brings the kind of wit energy and sheer movie magnetism that heralds an interesting career ahead.

Director; Rick Famuyiwa (155). R Language nudity drug use violence. Area theaters. ""Dope"" opens with three definitions for the word in the title -- the drug the person and the compliment. By the end of Rick Famuyiwas peppy of-the-moment teen comedy our lead character the affable Malcolm (newcomer Shameik Moore) will deal with all three. Unfortunately this split personality adds a few extra kilos to this low-budget Sundance hit which is about 30 minutes too long. But theres still enough here to keep you buzzing. In the rough L.A. neighborhood called The Bottoms Malcolm and his two buddies Jib (Tony Revolori ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"") and Diggy (Kiersey Clemons ""Transparent"") dodge gangs and bullies en route to class. Theyre mocked for their good grades and love of 90s hip-hop. Accused of liking ""white things"" theyve formed a pop-punk band Awreeoh which is funny when said out loud. Tony Revolori (l.) as Jib Kiersey Clemons (c.) as Diggy and Shameik Moore as Malcolm in ""Dope"" (Open Road Films) Malcolms only goal is to get to college. To do that hell need a good personal essay and the recommendation of a local business leader. A crush on Nakia (Zoe Kravitz) leads to a party thrown by tough guy Dom (rapper AAP Rocky). Then a shootout leads to a mix-up and suddenly Malcolm is carrying a backpack full of the drug MDMA. After following a tense trail to the top dealer hes tasked with selling the supply himself. Thats when ""Dope takes a turn toward the entrepreneurial as the gang uses the Dark Web Bitcoin and a manipulation of pop culture memes. (Just as the soundtracks use of Public Enemy Digital Underground and Naughty By Nature evoke the 90s soon folks will watch these scenes and think ""So 2015"") (Shameik Moore as Malcolm and Zoe Kravitz as Nakia in ""Dope"" (Open Road Films) The tone is fast and funny with a modern ""Risky Business"" or ""Ferris Buellers Day Off"" vibe but theres an additional layer that stems from the violence of the neighborhood. The stakes are very real for kids like Malcolm living hand-to-mouth and attending an underfunded school with only one shot at getting out. Its no wonder some top African-American celebs (Sean Combs Pharrell Williams) have lent support as exec producers of the film. But unfortunately many scenes seriously overstay their welcome and dont land the intended laughs. At times the film is just dopey though theres enough in the mix thats addictive. ON A MOBILE DEVICE?

Photo Credit AP / Rachel Morrison advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A nerdy kid in a bad neighborhood gets mixed up in a drug deal. Rated R. BOTTOM LINE A freewheeling comedy about sex drugs and identity politics. CAST Shameik Moore ZoA<< Kravitz Kiersey Clemons AAP Rocky LENGTH 145 Malcolm the young hero of Rick Famuyiwas ""Dope"" has a question for those who read his Harvard application What color would you assume he is? Malcolm loves hip-hop sings in a punk band excels at math and lives in a rough section of Inglewood California. Heres another clue He recently began selling drugs. ""Dope"" a comedy about a black kid who sometimes seems kind of white arrives in theaters with uncanny timing amid a national debate over Rachel Dolezal the white former official at the NAACP who was passing as black. The two situations arent precisely analogous -- dishonesty is different from nonconformity -- but they raise the same question Can anyone really define race? Malcolm played by amiable newcomer Shameik Moore (and a clear alter ego for the films Inglewood-raised writer-director) suspects its mostly just a pile of signifiers and stereotypes. advertisement | advertise on newsday To the point Malcoms band Awreeoh is pronounced ""Oreo"" like the racial pejorative. The bassist Jib (Tony Revolori) appears to be Indian while the drummer Diggy (an appealing Kiersey Clemons) is a black lesbian. Malcolm wants to assure his dream girl Nakia (Zoe Kravitz) that he isnt at all like her drug-dealing ex-boyfriend Dom (rapper AAP Rocky in an assured debut). When Malcolm winds up holding Doms massive stash of molly however he may have to walk a new walk. ""Dope"" unfolds like a rowdy teen comedy with wild parties topless girls and a bit of rough violence. The real fun however comes when the characters talk. The lingua franca is hip-hop -- thugs geeks FBI agents and Harvard businessmen all speak it -- but it can complicate matters. For instance Malcolms white friend Will (Blake Anderson) cries reverse racism when hes forbidden from using the N-word. Diggy slaps him for it Malcolm allows it and Jib who is ""14 percent black"" is on the fence. ""Dope"" makes a good companion piece to last years ""Dear White People"" another sharp comedy about young people navigating an ostensibly post-racial world. One of ""Dopes"" best features is a vintage hip-hop soundtrack with four pop-punk songs by Awreeoh. Those were produced by Pharrell Williams who drew scorn last year when he defined himself as ""the New Black."" Maybe he was onto something.

Charismatic youngster Shameik Moore plays Malcolm a brilliant high school senior from Inglewood who loves 90s hip hop but sings in a punk band called Oreo because you know hes into white shit too. The (totally unnecessary and redundant) narration from producer Forest Whitaker will tell you hes a geek but dont be fooled Malcolm is a social superhero capable of navigating any social situation (life-threatening or otherwise) with bashful aplomb. And the girls love him As fantasies go its entertaining and funny enough (though often lazily so). But every now and then the film decides its time for shit to get real which mostly serves to heighten the unreality of everything else. (A minor illustration Malcolms friend pauses in his effort to flee a lethal restaurant shootout to snag his to-go order of chili cheese fries. Geeky high-school kids sure do love their snacks) In other places its flat and padded at the same time a lengthy discussion of whos allowed to say the n-word an extended riff on a dudes substitution of ""b""s for soft ""c""s.

Inventive and smart.Shameik Moore plays Malcolm a nerd growing up in a tough neighborhood in ""Dope.""(Photo Open Road Films)Story HighlightsCritics rating 4.5 stars (out of 5)Famuyiwa shows great inventiveness with the camera employing many styles.The film recognizes cliches without dropping into them.Theres a little bit of everything in ""Dope"" Rick Famuyiwas film that mixes teen-coming-of-age elements with grittier street-life drug themes with some geek culture thrown in for good measure.You dont have to look too closely to see bits of ""Boyz n the Hood"" ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" even ""Risky Business"" thrown together -- but with such visual inventiveness and Famuyiwas willingness to try anything that it comes together as something original.Malcolm (Shameik Moore) is a high-school senior growing up in a poor Black neighborhood of Los Angeles. But he and his friends Jib (Tony Revolori) and Diggy (Kiersey Clemons) have avoided the drug and gang culture in part by being geeks who care more about getting good grades and getting into good colleges than any kind of thug life.Interview Shameik Moore puts in Dope performanceBut they also embrace 90s hip-hop culture (even if Malcolms timeline sometimes gets a little fuzzy) -- Malcolms hilariously dopey-looking high-top fade announces this -- and have their own punk band. None of this endears them to their classmates or the gangbangers hanging around on the corners.One day Malcolm is riding his bike and is summoned by Dom (rapper Rakim Mayers who records as AAP Rocky) to deliver a message to Nakia (Zoe Kravitz) who lives nearby He wants Nakia to come to his birthday party. Malcolm was attracted to her already so he delivers the message. Nakia says to tell Dom she will come -- if Malcolm comes too.Thus Malcolm Jib and Diggy wind up as underage guests at a club where things go well enough until a drug deal in a backroom goes bad. A gunfight erupts and Malcolm gets Nakia out (Jib and Diggy have already escaped). The next day Malcolm discovers that Dom stashed a boatload of drugs in his backpack during the chaos. Doms in jail but a lot of people want the drugs -- people who dont care what they have to do to get them.Malcolm and his friends try to deliver the drugs to the palatial estate Dom directs them to; things go weird and then wrong. They get weirder still when events force them to sell the drugs themselves. Theres a long explanation why that doesnt really wash but it offers another chance to see how Malcolm Jib and Diggy -- and Famuyiwa -- bring a new twist to what could play as a cliche.AZCENTRALDope (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsThroughout the film Famuyiwa who also wrote the script uses split screens and backs up the film and jumps around and freezes the action but hes not showing off. He uses these techniques to tell his story and doesnt overuse them to the point of annoyance.The acting is uniformly good. This is Moores first big role and he delivers a performance both entertaining and believable. Clemons doesnt say much but makes the most of her character a young gay woman who laughs at her churchs attempts to ""cure"" her. And AAP Rocky is surprisingly good as the drug dealer Dom who didnt get to his relatively lofty position without being smart.It almost goes without saying that ""Dope"" gives us a look at Black life and culture we see far too rarely. But well say it anyway It is a welcome point of view and Famuyiwa and his actors make the most of it.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

"Dope (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Dope (R) The mean streets of Inglewood are no place for a nerd. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com6/18/2015 Editor rating 2.5 Theres a lot packed into Dope writer-director Rick Famuyiwas daring often funny comedy about three self-proclaimed geeks living in the dangerous streets of Inglewood California -- or as the films protagonist Malcolm (Shameik Moore) calls them ""The Bottoms."" Malcolm and his two best friends -- Jib (Tony Revolori who played the bellhop in The Grand Budapest Hotel) and Diggy (Kiersey Clemons) a lesbian who dresses as a boy -- are obsessed with 1990s hip-hop culture (Malcolm sports a hi-top fade Kid n Play style) getting good grades and playing punk rock music. But their environment keeps getting in their way Drug slingers on every block bullies at school lack of parenting and few economic means (one of Malcolms most prized possessions is his pair of Air Jordans which become a running gag through the film). One of the best things about Dope is the way in which the movie is able to depict life from the perspective of its characters who have grown up surrounded by violence and danger. When one of their friends is shot and killed while standing in line at a fast-food restaurant the only thing Malcolm and Jib really care about is getting their hands on his comic-book collection. Famuyiwa (The Wood Brown Sugar) skirts the edge of tastelessness and keeps the films energy buzzing by refusing to succumb to melodrama. Whether the film is using a close-up of a blood-splattered Game Boy or a hilarious debate on who is allowed to use the n-word (Jib says he can because he is 14-percent African-American) Dope never strays far from its comedic roots even after bullets start flying. Imagine a cross between Boyz n the Hood and a John Hughes picture and you start to get a sense of what Famuyiwa was chasing. He comes close to succeeding too but Dope ultimately overdoses on its own charm. The movie throws in so many characters and subplots -- including Malcolms crush on the beautiful Nakia (Zoe Kravitz) the girlfriend of an amiable drug dealer -- that by the time the main trio embarks on an elaborate scheme to sell a stash of stolen MDMA online you feel like youre watching three films at once. Dope has a sharp eye for cultural and ethnic differences (""All we gotta do is find the white people who go to Coachella"" Diggy offers as a way for them to find someone to buy their drugs) and aside from a few excruciating contrivances most of the characters in the film refuse to settle into stereotypes (Quincy Brown son of executive producer Sean Combs is terrific in a few scenes as a spoiled rich kid who turns out to be a sweetheart). But by the time Malcolm is deciding whether to fire the gun hes holding in his shaking hands (with his application to Harvard pending) Dope has overstayed its welcome. Here is the rare movie overstuffed with memorable moments that would have been better if there had been fewer of them.

"Dope review A teens no-good very bad but finally excellent day - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Dope review A teens no-good very bad but finally excellent day Dope Open Road Films Quincy Brown from left Kiersey Clemons Shameik Moore and Tony Revolori star in ""Dope."" Quincy Brown from left Kiersey Clemons Shameik Moore and Tony Revolori star in ""Dope."" (Open Road Films) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune ""Dope"" Rick Famuyiwas Inglewood-set riff on ""Risky Business"" is as tasty as a Randys Donut. It sounds clueless and blinkered to compare the vibrant new comedy ""Dope"" set in multicultural Inglewood southwest of LA to the extremely white 1983 film ""Risky Business.""But wait. The filmmaker writer-director Rick Famuyiwa is the first to refer to his movie as ""Risky Business for the social-media generation."" Producer Mimi Valdes also quoted in the production notes adds that its focus is ""black nerds in the hood. Why hasnt anyone shown that part of the culture before? Heres an opportunity to show a black kid who is super smart trying to get into Harvard acing his SATs liking tech stuff and hip hop music and rock bands and grunge. Weve never seen that character in the movies."" Maybe so. Were certainly not likely to hear a better movie soundtrack in 2015. Famuyiwa has been around a while and his best work such as the screenplay for the Don Cheadle vehicle ""Talk to Me"" indicates a voice deserving of wider recognition. A hit at both Sundance and Cannes film festivals earlier this year ""Dope"" borrows from all over guided by its protagonists obsession with 90s music and fashion.Malcolm played by tall serene Shameik Moore is a graduating high school senior who lives with his bus driver mother (Kimberly Elise). His father Nigerian-born came in and out of their lives quickly and Malcolms only meaningful memento of the man is a copy of his favorite movie ""Superfly"" the one about the drug-dealing antihero. This is no casual detail for the events of ""Dope"" send Malcolm and his best friends into a criminal and lucrative orbit not unlike the milieu of ""Superfly."" At a nightclub birthday party thrown by drug dealer Dom (AAP Rocky) guns are pulled and bodies fall and Doms stash of ""Molly"" gets stashed in Malcolms backpack. Malcolm realizes this when the drug-sniffing security dogs at his school start growling. From there ""Dope"" becomes a survival comedy with Malcolm on the run though theres a little romance between Malcolm and Doms sometime squeeze (Zoe Kravitz a strong screen presence). Inside Out review Best Disney-Pixar film since Up Michael Phillips Director Pete Docters ""Inside Out"" springs from a single terrific idea.

What if a persons basic emotions were tiny humanoid sprites sharing a command center a spacious variation on the one in the starship Enterprise but inside the human brain? While the idea isnt new (you may recall the late... (Michael Phillips) Our heros best friends are superbly cast. Diggy out of the closet and ready for anything is played by Kiersey Clemons. The one they call ""Jib"" is handled by Tony Revolori a long way from his turn as Zero the bellboy in ""The Grand Budapest Hotel."" Not everything works in ""Dope."" Famuyiwa strains to make the scenes dependent on our understanding of a Bitcoin scam interesting. The scenes featuring the silky Harvard-educated drug lord Jacoby are muddied by the monotonous whispering Roger Guenveur Smith.Small matters. The film moves fleetly and the technique full of split-screen images and unpredictable flashbacks pulses with life. The bright hot cinematography consistently expressive is by Rachel Morrison. Music superstar Pharrell Williams executive-produced; Forest Whitaker narrates and also produced. The tone of ""Dope"" is very interesting -- funny but rarely stupid-funny. The film does not wear its serious observations about aspirations and realities and hypocrisies of all kinds (not just racial) in a heavy fashion. Life in ""The Bottoms"" the neighborhood from which Malcolm wants out may be dangerous but Famuyiwa presents it as part cautionary tale part merry cynical capitalist fable with a good-natured survivor at the center. Heaven Knows What review Heroin addicts on the edge Michael Phillips Mainstream audiences can only handle so much honesty in their portraits of addicts on screen. I have no doubt that the latest film from Josh and Benny Safdie ""Heaven Knows What"" will not appeal to the majority of casual moviegoers. Likewise I have no doubts regarding the films remarkable achievement.... Mainstream audiences can only handle so much honesty in their portraits of addicts on screen.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint In the annals of light comedy ""Dope"" floats up to the realm of helium balloons. Written and directed by Rick Famuyiwa its downright dainty as far as plot but a mostly tasty layer cake of drugs jokes sex jokes cool young cast members jokes 1992 hip-hop cartoony characters a heist and a lot more jokes. Caught between the 90s and now is Malcolm (a breakout turn for Shameik Moore). A shy African-American retro-geek fashion plate hes old school voguish to a fault. His period clothes make everybody else look lame. He sings and dances like mad in a punk band. Even his haircut is a flashback to that amazing vertical flat top Christopher Reid wore in the 1990 Kid n Play movie ""House Party."" Malcolm is also a straight-A student. Hes more than ready to leave his high school in the inner-city Los Angeles neighborhood of Inglewood -- home of the iconic 45-foot pastry perched atop Randys Donuts near LAX -- and move up to Harvard. While his brainpower is easily sufficient his finances make the odds of the transfer slim. Wouldnt it be convenient if there was a nightclub party including the local drug lord a shootout confusion and a large amount of MDMA secretly slipped into Malcolms backpack? Yes it would. Especially if Malcolms bitcoin approach to Molly merchandising can cover his Ivy League tuition. Theres not an overkill of creativity in the film but a grab bag of energy. The script fires off witty cultural references as it lists Malcolms love for ""white people"" pastimes such as ""Game of Thrones"" TV on the Radio and Donald Glover. His Harvard application is a thesis about Ice Cube. Malcolms friends -- nervous Jib (Tony Revolori the lobby boy of ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"") and easygoing lesbian Diggy (Kiersey Clemons) -- make a funny pair of helpers as he tries to get the merchandise on the street. Famuyiwa adds a few pinches of darkness to the story line not enough to silence the genially goofy comedy but adequate to hush it with social commentary for a minute. Opponents of gangsta life never fear The biggest of the films bad guy wannabes get the biggest spankings. Fans of smooth controlled filmmaking will get a whack too as ""Dope"" bounces between techniques including voice-overs flashbacks freeze frames and split screens. ""Dope"" chatters endlessly about Instagram the Darknet GIFs and YouTube but like Malcolm its obsessed with the good old days.

(Rachel Morrison/Open Road Films via AP) ""Dope"" ""Dope"" ""Dope"" ""Dope"" ""Geeks in the Hood"" could have been the subtitle of the new coming-of-age film ""Dope.""The movie a hit at this years Sundance Film Festival remarkably manages to share as much with John Hughes teen flicks of the 80s including a direct reference to Molly Ringwald as it does with the ""Boyz n the Hood"" street dramas of the 90s.Malcolm (Shameik Moore) who dresses in colorful 90s hip-hop attire is the head geek in a group that also includes Jib (Tony Revolori) and Diggy (Kiersey Clemons) a lesbian sometimes mistaken for a boy. The trio enjoy whats described as ""white people things"" including skateboarding studying and Donald Glover. Theyve formed a punk band and are predictably picked on by school bullies. Malcolm has his sights set on Harvard University though hes told hell never be admitted.They work their way into the birthday party of drug dealer Dom (rapper AAP Rocky) where Malcolm wants to get a little closer to the beautiful Nakia (Zoe Kravitz). Gunfire breaks out and Malcolm suddenly finds himself with a backpack stuffed with drugs packaged to sell and goons chasing him up and down the streets of Inglewood Calif.Taking the drugs to the police is ruled out; they fear theyll be incriminated despite their innocence. What comes next finds Malcolm and crew at the center of an adventure involving a spaced-out beauty some creative uses of social media the transformation of the high schools science center into a drug lab and Malcolms quest to get to his college interview on time. ""Dope"" occasionally narrated by Forest Whitaker (one of the films producers; Pharrell Williams is the executive producer) represents a nice return for director Rick Famuyiwa whose last film was the very average ""Our Family Wedding."" This indie film repositions him in the big leagues after previous films including ""The Wood"" and ""Brown Sugar.""Famuyiwa who is directing the HBO movie ""Confirmation"" starring Kerry Washington is used to working with bigger name actors but the young winning cast here shines particularly Moore.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Ann Hornaday June 18 2015 Follow AnnHornaday Every once in a while a movie and a moment converge in an uncanny collision of relevance. ""Dope"" an exuberant coming-of-age comedy that beguiled audiences at Sundance earlier this year engages the issues of race identity and authenticity currently aswirl in the culture much in the way that Ryan Cooglers 2013 Sundance hit ""Fruitvale Station"" eerily echoed the Trayvon Martin story that was dominating headlines when it came out. Granted ""Dope"" is much funnier than that sober-minded fact-based drama and by design. The story of a self-described geek trying to survive life while nursing an unabashed obsession with skateboards Japanese manga the band TV on the Radio and getting into Harvard this giddy observant picaresque tale hews more to lighthearted caper flicks and Ferris Bueller-type antics than grim observation of societal ills. And it doesnt come by way of an audacious newbie either. ""Dope"" was written and directed by Rick Famuyiwa best known for the turn-of-the-millennium classics ""The Wood"" (1999) and ""Brown Sugar"" (2002). Famuyiwas pedigree surely explains the healthy strain of nostalgia for the African American pop culture that flourished in the 1990s from hip-hop and rom-coms to ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air."" But despite Famuyiwas status as a relative veteran ""Dope"" brims with the energy and unbridled brio of someone discovering anew the unabashed pleasure of telling a story that with meaning and purpose hits perilously close to the bone. Rocking a high-top fade worthy of early Will Smith Malcolm (Shameik Moore) is a straight-A student at his high school in the Los Angeles suburb of Inglewood where he rolls with his fellow 90s-nerd friends Jib (Tony Revolori) and Diggy (Kiersey Clemons) reminiscing about the heyday of ""Yo MTV Raps"" and trying to avoid the Crips and Bloods who occasionally harass him for his sneakers. When Malcolm meets Nakia (Zoe Kravitz) the sometime girlfriend of a neighborhood tough played by rapper AAP Rocky Malcolm becomes infatuated. Seeking her out he runs afoul of a gang of drug runners sending him and his crew on a wacky trip to an underworld rife with drugs guns and mobsters a journey that will eventually lead them into the darkest nether regions of the digital black market known as the Dark Web. As frightening and even fatal as that world is ""Dope"" is permeated with a sense of resilience and philosophical good humor as Malcolm tries to reconcile his role as a studious Ivy League aspirant with his new far shadier life. Moore delivers a shy sweetly disarming performance as the conflicted Malcolm receiving able support from Revolori and Clemons who is a revelation as a young lesbian who must regularly attend church so her relatives can ""pray away the gay."" The fact that Diggy joins in on the movies lusty male gaze doesnt do much to soften the near-constant allusions to ""hoes"" and other harsher epithets for women. The films male wish fulfillment becomes particularly preposterous when a gorgeous millionaires daughter played by Chanel Iman throws herself at Malcolm in an MDMA-fueled swoon. Admittedly that improbable sequence ends in a grossly amusing instance of comeuppance and Quincy Brown as her anxiously entitled brother manages to steal every scene hes in. Browns character who has grown up in privilege far from Inglewoods Bottoms where Malcolm and his friend are from is perpetually questioning whether hes ""black enough"" a complicated question having to do with performance self- presentation and interior narrative that runs through the heart of ""Dope."" Such questions of identity arent limited to black characters. In a scene reminiscent of last years similarly themed ""Dear White People"" a white hipster receives an amusingly on-point tutorial on the donts and donts of using the n-word. Like its fellow Sundance hit ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" Famuyiwas movie is nominally about a pop culture-obsessed teenager navigating friendship and love while worrying about getting into college. But where the African American Earl of that film was reduced to a one-note caricature of ""ethnic"" comic relief in ""Dope"" its as if he has been given the visibility voice and complexity that was otherwise denied him. The climax of the movie is really its penultimate sequence when Malcolm delivers a soaring soliloquy on perception reality and the racial assumptions that reduce so many young African American men to toxic media tropes. Famuyiwa reminds viewers not to believe -- or worse internalize -- the hype and he provides a great deal of cheeky infectious fun in the process. Put another way ""Dope"" is the bomb. R.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Dope often brings to mind early Spike Lee not because its characters represent a broad cross section of black life or because its fixated on the aesthetics of the Mars Blackmon era but because writer-director Rick Famuyiwa seems to have opinions on everything from race to romance to politics and treats filmmaking partly as an excuse to voice them. Topics include bitcoin drone strikes ""praying away the gay"" phone tracking the culture of college application essays perceptions of blackness and authenticity middle-class white attitudes toward sex and what does and doesnt constitute the Golden Age of rap. Buried somewhere in there is an over-burdened overworked action-comedy premise about three teenage hip-hop geeks who get hold of a backpack full of powdered MDMA. Best known for his 1999 debut feature The Wood Famuyiwa is not a young filmmaker by most metrics but his movie is animated by that hunger for self-expression that used to be taken for granted in up-and-coming indies but is now rare. His hero is Malcolm Adekanbi (Shameik Moore) a Nigerian-American high school senior in the Los Angeles suburb of Inglewood obsessed with early 90s hip-hop and getting into Harvard. (It should be noted that Famuyiwa is also a Nigerian-American from Inglewood and that most of Malcolms interests had their heyday when he was in high school.) Nursing a crush on Nakia (Zoe Kravitz) the on-and-off girlfriend of local drug dealer Dom (AAP Rocky) he sneaks into Doms nightclub birthday party with best friends Diggy (Kiersey Clemons) and Jib (The Grand Budapest Hotels Tony Revolori) which ends with a shoot-out and Malcolm making off with several pounds of Doms product. What follows is convoluted and sometimes confused as Malcolm Diggy and Jib cross paths with Bloods over-sexed rich kids and knockoff handbag wholesalers all the while trying to prepare their college applications. There are musical numbers (by Pharrell Williams) occasional explanatory voice-overs (by Forest Whitaker) and plenty of stylized social-media montages. (The montages dont always work though Dope does boast one of the more convincing fictional memes in filmdom built around a bystander saying ""How am I supposed to eat my pound cake?"" during a local news interview.) The humor is broad and often cartoonish but that doesnt preclude it from being occasionally incisive. Nor for that matter does Dopes breathless messiness cancel out the charm of Famuyiwas quick-cut filmmaking which syncretizes slick techniques and old-school tastes.Dope has more characters and subplots than it knows what to do with and its performances are all over the place ranging from Clemons and Revoloris charismatic turns as second-banana goofballs to Roger Guenveur Smiths stylized impression of a local millionaire so vampiric that he might as well be slathered in German Expressionist makeup. Even Moore swings from likable understatement to Jerry Lewis-level fidgetiness depending on the scene. Still in an era full of indifferent cookie-cutter indies an excess of ideas and personality is hardly a bad thing.

Standout acting by Shameik Moore and writing/directing by Rick Famuyiwa make this film about a smart kid from the inner city metamorphosing into a focused and fearless man a revelatory experience. Share story By Soren AndersenSpecial to The Seattle Times ""Dope"" is a movie of defining moments. One in particular. It comes near the end when its central character a high-school kid from inner-city Inglewood Calif. named Malcolm Adekanbi (Shameik Moore) discovers just who he really is. In a situation in which he finds himself in great danger he shows incredible determination while trembling with fearful indecision. Those contradictory impulses entwine tightly together in a moment where for an instant hes ""half a boy and half a man half at sea and half on land"" to quote a lyric from an obscure 60s band called the Flaming Groovies that Malcolm who worships at the altar of 90s-era hip-hop and sports a retro high-top fade hairstyle would never have heard of. But hey it fits. Movie Review    Dope with Shameik Moore Tony Revolori Kiersey Clemons. Written and directed by Rick Famuyiwa. 115 minutes. Rated R for language drug content sexuality/nudity and some violence all involving teens. Several theaters. The moment passes and when it does hes left boyhood behind and has become a man.

Its an astonishing metamorphosis and a brilliant feat of acting. Moore whos done some TV work and is also a singer and dancer emerges as a genuine movie star in ""Dope."" Hes very good looking and has charisma to burn and he controls the screen in every scene hes in. Which is practically every scene. The other true star of the movie which wowed audiences at the Sundance Film Festival is writer-director Rick Famuyiwa. He grew up in Inglewood and his real-life experiences provided the raw material for the screenplay. Malcolm is a self-described geek and proud of it. Hes a bright kid who is tight with his two nerdy best friends Diggy (Kiersey Clemons) a smart-mouthed tomboy and Jib (Tony Revolori). Skateboard kids garage-band musicians good students who dream of going to college (Malcolm has his sights set on Harvard) they walk a tightrope between the gangbangers and drug dealers that infest their neighborhood. Until one day theyre toppled off the tightrope by a wild set of unfortunate circumstances that have them running for their lives as theyre embroiled in some heavy-duty drug dealing. How to escape? How to survive? Hint with smarts and humor. The humor is raucous and raunchy. The smarts give rise to a scheme involving Bitcoins and advanced computer hacking. The combination of those elements handled with deftness and intelligence by Famuyiwa plus Moores extraordinary performance make ""Dope"" a tremendously affecting movie.

Photo Open Road Films MOVIE REVIEW Dope Running time 115 minutes. Rated R (violence profanity sexuality nudity drug references all involving teens). The thing about ""John Hughes meets Boyz n the Hood "" as a log line for a movie is that in ""Dope"" these ideas dont go together any better than a milkshake does with razor blades. By turns whimsical and violent ""Dope"" is a teen comedy about Malcolm a nerdy straight-A student (Shameik Moore) from the hood in Inglewood Calif. Along with two misfit pals he finds himself with a backpack full of drugs (and a pistol) he cant return to their owner. Instead hes forced to go into business and sell the stuff himself learning a lesson that might make for a colorful personal-growth essay to submit with his Harvard application. ""Dope"" was a huge success at the Sundance Film Festival which is to say that an audience whiter than a Kennebunkport country club believed it spoke to them about the black experience. But as a comedy the film isnt especially funny and as a screwball drug caper a la ""Go"" its raggedly plotted with ridiculous coincidences popping up everywhere. Whenever a serious plot hurdle pops up it just disappears Malcolm brings the stash into school setting off both the metal detector and the drug-sniffing dog but the security guard simply lets him go without searching him. Shameik Moore and Zoe KravitzPhoto Open Road Films The love story is even more difficult to believe with the streetwise girlfriend (Zoe Kravitz) of a drug dealer (AAP Rocky) inexplicably showing an interest in Malcolm. Among the many bizarrely discordant moments are a romantic scene with her and Malcolm cutely discussing the prom just after they were nearly killed in a wild shootout at a club that no one considers remarkable enough to even mention. Mixed in among the scary gangsters and the kid who gets killed ordering a meal at a fast-food joint are jokes about Coachella ""Boys Dont Cry"" ancestry.com and the meaning of the metaphor ""slippery slope."" Dangerous dudes take time out to discuss President Obamas drone policy. This movies a great big mess of ""Huh?"" Give ""Dope"" points for youthful energy and for Moores winning performance in the lead -- he comes across as canny nimble alert skilled at making things up as he goes along. If only that were true of the movie as well.

"Review Dope is Risky Business for a new generation - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Dope is Risky Business for a new generationBy Randy MyersSan Jose Mercury News CorrespondentPosted 06/17/2015 120000 PM PDTUpdated 06/17/2015 041236 PM PDTBack in 1983 Tom Cruise clad in tighty-whities and crew socks skated around his familys gargantuan home and crash-landed into all sorts of mischief. That film ""Risky Business"" set a high bar for the R-rated coming-of-age comedy. It was confident it was sexy and it was daringly observant.""Dope"" is this generations ""Business.""Writer/director Rick Famuyiwa (""The Wood"" ""Brown Sugar"") shakes up the teen comedy formula and in the process has made one exciting and adventurous film. ""Dope"" might use a similar ""Risky"" setup -- a geeky high school senior unwittingly learns harsh lessons about life after landing in big trouble -- but thats where the similarities end. The 2015 Sundance favorite is a true original as it plays with tone structure and filming techniques. Best of all its set in a place Hollywood rarely visits in this genre -- the poverty-stricken violence-prone area of Los Angeles known as ""The Bottoms"" -- and convincingly pinpoints what needs to be fixed in this country. Opens June 19 2015 - (L-R) Tony Revolori as Jib Kiersey Clemons as Diggy and Shameik Moore as Malcolm in Dope. (Rachel Morrison/Open Road Films) ""Dope"" is top-tier satire told with passion intelligence and conviction a wild sometimes-unruly risk taker that makes us laugh loudly but has something serious to say about how society traps youths based on their skin color and ZIP code.Yet its never a preachy lecture as it taps into the spirit of a teen living in Inglewood and how he uses his smarts to both fight and use a broken system intent on keeping him from achieving his dream of going to Harvard.Advertisement A 4.0 student and 90s hip-hop fan Malcolm Adekanbi (Shameik Moore in a breakout performance) and his best buddies -- the equally smart lesbian Diggy (Kiersey Clemons) and the skittish Jib (Tony Revolori) -- find their lives upended when Malcolm discovers his backpack has been stuffed with a whole lot of dope -- dubbed Molly (Ringwald get it?) -- and a firearm. Both are the property of a drug dealer Dom (rapper AAP Rocky) who stuffs all of it in Malcolms backpack when the nightclub the trio has sneaked into erupts into a chaotic gunfight. The most logical next step would seem to be for Malcolm to go to the authorities but he knows that would likely leave him and his friends with targets on their backs or land them in jail. The threesome resolve that their only recourse is to actually sell the hot goods. Thats a bold direction to take his film in and Famuyiwa handles the topic with the right touch mixing the pointed comedy with elements of violence and danger. The misadventures fluctuate from funny to serious and lead the trio to unexpected encounters with off-the-wall characters including Harvard alum A.J. (Roger Guenveur Smith) whos a drug-dealing mastermind a zonked-out rich girl Lily (Chanel Iman) and her full-of-himself brother Jaleel (Quincy Brown). My favorite is the geeky white hacker Will (Blake Anderson). The ambitious storyline pays homage to John Hughes and thats especially evident in the nascent romance between Malcolm and Nakia (Zoe Kravitz).The fresh-faced cast is across-the-board excellent but its the breakout performance from singer/actor and dancer Moore that makes the film so enjoyable. Moore dances away with ""Dope"" with the same charismatic fireworks that Cruise shot off in ""Business."" Moores a versatile actor and conveys a rich heart-melting earnestness that wins you over immediately.If Famuyiwa deserves the lions share of acclaim for making ""Dope"" such an inventive hyperactive and electrifying comedy it is nevertheless Moore who gives ""Dope"" its big heart. dope    1/2Rating R (for language drug content sexuality/nudity and some violence -- all involving teens)Cast Shameik Moore Kiersey Clemons Tony Revolori Zoe Kravitz AAP Rocky Blake Anderson Chanel ImanDirector and writer Rick FamuyiwaRunning time 1 hour 55 minutes (L-R) Quincy Brown as Jaleel Kiersey Clemons as Diggy Shameik Moore as Malcolm and Tony Revolori as Jib in Dope.

Jib (Tony Revolori left) Diggy (Kiersey Clemons) and Malcolm (Shameik Moore) co-star in the indie comedy ""Dope"" about three friends into 90s hip-hop computers and punk rock in Inglewood. Photo Open Road Malcolms in the middle of a Dope dilemma 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Usually with coming-of-age comedies theres some whiff of fake about it some compromise some backing off of the moral complexities but not ""Dope."" Its a movie about a geeky teenager living in the Los Angeles hood and something about it or rather everything about it feels real. The first smart thing that writer-director Rick Famuyiwa does is make his central character complicated. Malcolm (Shameik Moore) knows computers and he has great ambitions to go to an Ivy League school but he also does drugs occasionally is fanatical about 90s hip-hop and would very much like to lose his virginity. Also high on his list is surviving which in his neighborhood is a day-to-day proposition. Think about this ""Dope"" is a teen comedy -- you could almost think of it as the African American ""Risky Business"" -- in which the prospect of sudden death is ever-present. That should be an insane combination and in the truest sense it is insane but its grounded in reality and soon the audience begins to feel the pressure and understand the terms of daily life. Every time Malcolm leaves the house he might get killed. And that possibility is more than theoretical. It might actually happen. Everything is dangerous -- standing in line in a fast-food place waiting for a bus going to a party. When Malcolm goes to school his sneakers are stolen. Riding home on his bike he has a choice. He can drive through a group of gang members or go the other route and pass all the drug dealers. In such moments Famuyiwa creates a sense of urgency and anxiety while somehow maintaining ""Dope"" as a comedy -- in fact a very funny comedy. The movie takes place at a tense juncture in Malcolms life. He is preparing his application to Harvard which includes getting interviewed by an alumnus. And he is trying to unload about 100000 in heroin that someone stashed in his backpack. He had no idea it was there. He just went to school one day unzipped the bag to get a book and there it was. As the screenplay keeps reminding us to live in the hood is to be constantly choosing between bad options. A black teenager walking into a police station with a bag full of heroin thats not going to work. Trying to return the drugs to its owner or to one of the dangerous characters claiming to be its owner thats probably not a healthy course of action either. What keeps ""Dope"" in the realm of comedy -- honestly without softening the dangers surrounding the characters -- is that the promise of this time of life is made vivid. Malcolm could go around the corner and get killed but he might turn the other corner and run into Zoe Kravitz as Nakia. And she might look at him and see something the reflection of her own longing to get out for example a hunger for something better that matches her own. Malcolm knows that he is running for his life but the audience at least recognizes that he is also having the time of his life. Every door that opens brings another adventure. If he ever lands in a safe place he is going to come away with lots of stories to tell. As Malcolm Shameik Moore is a forceful sympathetic locus with an appealing gentleness of spirit that in no way seems entirely innocent. Theres a drive there. As for Zoe Kravitz she is having one terrific year. She was the best thing in ""The Road Within"" she co-starred in ""Mad Max"" and ""Insurgent"" and now shes the linchpin of ""Dope."" She entered 2015 barely known and may end it as a movie star. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic. E-mail mlasallesfchronicle.com Twitter MickLaSalle Dope Comedy-drama.

Heres a dramatic teen comedy flavor-crystaled with sex and drugs and innocent raunch about good friends who get caught up in bad business on their way to a climax that involves the dramatic recitation of a college application essay. The soundtracks a choice nostalgic mixtape and the likable leads feel like stars on the rise especially Shameik Moore handsome yet half-formed the kind of young actor who makes you feel as you watch that hes somehow your onscreen surrogate -- that in these situations you might feel and respond as he does. Like Dazed amp; Confused or The Breakfast Club this is a film about just how weird the extraordinarily normal kids are -- kids like you.Malcolm sticks up for Summertime by the Fresh Prince.Film DetailsCritics Pick Dope RatingR GenreComedy Running Time115 min. More Info Trailer Its also set in the Bottoms of Inglewood. Instead of the usual teen-film anthropological rundown of which clique sits where at lunchtime Dope taxonomizes black geekdom -- the best-friend leads are into ""white shit"" like good grades and Donald Glover and they all dress in something like Nineties hip-hop cosplay. Famuyiwa is smart about the way cultural choice-making for young people is very much about the creation of selves. Through passionate curation Malcolm (Moore) and his friends -- lesbian Diggy (Kiersey Clemons) and skinny Jib (Tony Revolori The Grand Budapest Hotel) -- are auditioning who they might grow up to be and by their senior year theyve developed a confidence about their own isolated coolness. When Malcolm tells an adviser that hes going to Harvard the adviser accuses him of arrogance when its exactly that self-regarding determination that might give Malcolm a chance.But they also face more immediate concerns. What route home can you take when theres Bloods on one block and dealers looking to jack with you on the next? Life Malcolm tells us is ""a daily navigation between bad and worse options."" But being a geek in Inglewood means inventing a choice where none existed previously. Wearing a high fade and sticking up for ""Summertime"" by the Fresh Prince? Thats his way of signaling that hes charting his own course.Related StoriesPodcast Theres Hope in DopeMain Attrakionz Clear the Clouds With 808s amp; Dark Grapes IIIBut he cant always. You can see Malcolm sifting through his bad and worse options when Dom (AAP Rocky) a local druglord on the rise asks him to deliver a flirty message to a young woman studying for her G.E.D. across the block (Zoe Kravitz). Malcolm knows this tough older kid might be setting him up for something awful -- but hes out of options to navigate toward. EXPAND Rachel Morrison/Open Road Films From that incident Famuyiwa spins a complex unpredictable often suspenseful series of misadventures. Malcolm and his pals crash Doms private club party wind up chased by another on-the-make druglord and take refuge with the offspring of a shady businessman a rich-kid brother and sister given to tough-guy bravado and eager nudity. Malcolm is also prepping for his big interview with a Harvard alum who went to his high school the head of a small payday loan empire. Meanwhile Malcolm Diggy and Jib also rehearse and record as a punk band called Oreo -- and they even play a triumphant set at a drugged-out USC frat party. Their music written by Pharrell Williams is probably the one element too many in this busy breezy picture. If the kids are that good why arent they taking music seriously?/pgt;Eventually Malcolm is left with only the worst of all options and he has to offload a stash of molly. But the drug-selling here is more Risky Business entrepreneurism than Boyz n the Hood streetfight. Dope often feels like the rejuvenated Famuyiwa who wrote and directed The Wood is trying to cram it full of everything hes ever wanted to get into a movie. He chucks in Pop-Up Video effects and an explosion of .gif files of-the-moment pop-punk and VHS tapes of Yo MTV Raps. There are asides about band camp Bitcoins and masturbation and a glorious comic scene where a sympathetic white hippie pleads sincerely that A Tribe Called Quests ""Sucka Nigga"" gives him license to use the one word white folks cant say. He intends it as a term of endearment he insists. Malcolm and Jib shrug it off; Diggy smacks the shit out of him. (Her best Nineties look a bare midriff and boxers sticking up out of her pants a la TLC.)Again and again Dope puts us in Malcolms Air Jordans letting us sweat or fear or hope right with him. The director and star understand that an everyman/everywoman quality is key to the best teen films which trade in embarrassment and promise. Even if youve grown up you should wince when the lead says something dumb to a crush and you should cheer when an idealist sets right something wrong with this world that youve perhaps learned not to take so personally.Dope is persuasive in its empathy always tugging at universal feeling even as it situates us in its neighborhoods specifics. The Inglewood details -- the drug dog at the entrance to the high school the mostly empty room where Malcolm and friends take the S.A.T. -- might for many viewers make Dope resonate more deeply than most teen films manage. Teen movies have often taken place in vague moneyed suburbs built on the lie that there is one baseline American experience -- that Jason Biggs humping a pie speaks for everyone while House Party is niche entertainment.But every everyman has to come from someplace and the honest struggles faced by Malcolm and his friends are truer in spirit to those faced by most young Americans of any race than the movies usually get. This is a story about growing up getting out even as you discover that much of what you reject about the world youre raised in is already there inside you -- and that you can bring all that to the next place which will be better for it. Better still Famuyiwa has laced these truths and others into an entertainment that above all else simply cooks along as a first-rate teen comedy caper film. Theres hope in Dope.Written and directed by Rick Famuyiwa.

Three geeks go gangsta in Dope the vibrant and entertaining fourth feature from writer-director Rick Famuyiwa (Our Family Wedding). Like his debut feature The Wood this film is set in his hometown of Inglewood Calif. and focuses on three fast friends here nerdy kids who combine prepping their university applications and SATs with a sideline selling a huge stash of drugs that accidentally ends up in their lap -- or rather their backpack. Like Fruitvale Station the film was produced by Forest Whitaker (who also cameos as the narrator) and shot by Rachel Morrison with the latters dynamic camera work adding energy color and verve. Bouncy with snappy dialog to spare and a great young cast headed by breakout star Shameik Moore this is a crowd-pleaser from start to finish. Unsurprisingly the film has already sparked something of a bidding war at Sundance. See more Sundance Exclusive Photos of Kristen Wiig Jack Black Ethan Hawke and More Malcolm (Moore) with his flat-top haircut vintage clothes and BMX bike looks like a runaway from the 1990s which is exactly how he likes it. Like him his buddies the thin-as-a-reed Jib (Tony Revolori the bellboy from The Grand Budapest Hotel) and butch lesbian Diggy (Kiersey Clemons Transparent) love 90s hip-hop and other ""shit white people like"" such as ""Donald Glover and good grades."" Their geek status at school means that the adult staff leaves them alone but they are picked on by the cool kids who bully Malcolm into handing over his cool sneakers in an early very kinetic chase scene. The main plot is set in motion when after bluffing their way into a party for a local hoodlum Dom (AAP Rocky) they run out of the club as the fete devolves into a gunfight only to discover the next day that Malcolms backpack is now full of drugs and a gun. From here springs a cascading series of events that keeps piling on one delicious twist after another as the initially clueless kids try to return the drugs to their owner -- but confusion arises about whom that might actually be. More from THR at Sundance An interlude at the house of two rich kids (model Chanel Iman and Quincy Brown the son of the films co-executive producer Sean ""Diddy"" Combs) results in a hilarious set piece that involves driving on molly a conversation about ""lunch"" (a code word for drugs) at a hamburger joint that leads to a shoot-out and a necessary pee break that almost breaks the Internet. The madcap plotting and energy here temporarily turn things into something out of a Looney Tunes cartoon (almost a necessity since otherwise the frequent gun violence would turn this into a much darker movie). Circumstances later lead the kids to try and sell the drugs themselves and part of the films charm -- as well as a lot of its humor -- is derived from the contrast between the nerdy overachievers who want to leave their neighborhood behind and go to college and the illegal activities they find themselves engaging in. Its not every film that can turn the concept of a slippery slope into a repeatedly used and hilarious punch line and Famuyiwas dialogues are often not only funny but also sharp and smart. A notable exception is the way race plays a role in two scenes the first a discussion of why white people cant use the N-word -- which the black characters (including Jib who claims hes 14 percent African) here use more often than articles and verbs -- which is so drawn out (terminating in a weak and literal punch line) that it starts to feel like sermonizing while the second is the way race factors in to Malcolms Harvard application essay which is certainly truthful but lacks any kind of argument around it that would demonstrate his innate intelligence. See more The Scene at Sundance Film Festival 2015 The decision to also make the protags play in their own music group feels a little too much like a movie conceit (how many real-life geeks have their own bands in high school?) and their songs written by Pharrell Williams will no doubt help market the film but dont feel like they couldve been written by these three kids however brainy. That said the films overall energy which is reinforced by Morrisons dynamic camera and cutting from Lee Haugen and performances are spunky enough to almost always temporarily suspend disbelief when required. Onscreen in practically every frame Moore (Joyful Noise Incredible Crew) in his first lead role is clearly the star of the show shouldering that burden with enviable ease. His Malcolm the son of a single mother (Kimberly Elise) is an energetic young man full of contradictions whos believable as a straight-A student who can outsmart gangsters as well as someone whos intimidated by class bullies or any girl with any interest in him such as Imans drugged-out sex fiend or the sweet neighborhood girl that Zoe Kravitz imbues with more personality than she mustve had on the page. Revolori and Clemons meanwhile ace their sidekick roles and are the MVPs of the large supporting cast. Production and especially costume design have a ball working in references to the 1990s.

"Dope Review Rick Famuyiwas Buoyant Teenage Caper | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review Dope Dennis Harvey Film Critic 10 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr January 24 2015 | 1124PM PT Rick Famuyiwas indie-est project since The Woods is a buoyant teen caper comedy thats one of this years brighter Sundance commercial prospects. Sure to be one of the buzzier commercial prospects coming out of Sundance this year ""Dope"" is a buoyant teenage caper that has at least as much in common with John Hughes-style high-school comedies as it does with most hood narratives involving drugs gangs and crime. That mix risks silliness at times but theres so much playful energy and wit to Rick Famuyiwas indie-est project since ""The Wood"" (1999) that few viewers will mind. A soundtrack featuring new songs by Pharrell Williams will be a big plus in promoting a film that might conceivably fall between arthouse and mainstream camps theatrically but should play well to any wider audiences it reaches. High-school senior Malcolm (Shameik Moore) embodies one cliche demographically Hes a poor black Los Angeleno supported by a single working mom (Kimberly Elise) his father long gone (back to Africa in fact). But in other ways he embodies something else entirely. He as well as best friends Jib (Tony Revolori ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"") and Diggy (Kiersey Clemons) are all about ""white stuff"" -- meaning they like things that most in their black Inglewood neighborhood consider White People Territory including classic 90s hip-hop culture BMX biking getting good grades and miscellaneous geek fixations. Theyve even formed their own punk band. This just gets them regularly picked on by gangbangers in and out of school; going home each day they run a gauntlet of bullying jocks Bloods and dealers. One of the latter Dom (AAP Rocky) turns a chance encounter into an excuse to use Malcolm as go-between in his attempts to woo Nakia (Zoe Kravitz) the cornrowed beauty his messenger boy was already crushing on. This results in all of the above characters intersecting at a club for Doms birthday party that night. When the birthday celebrants backroom drug deal turns into a gun melee Malcolm scores points with Nakia by ushering her to safety. Its not until the next day that he realizes hes unknowingly ushered something else out -- Dom stuck 100000 worth of Ecstasy into the high schoolers backpack. Apprising Diggy and Jib of his predicament Malcolm is determined to get rid of the stuff before hes killed or before its detection kills his hopes of Ivy League enrollment. But it turns out Dom is now temporarily behind bars and fully armed others are already pursuing the missing goods. Instructions to hand them over to Doms surrogate results in a mid-film comic highlight embroiling the three youths in possible virginity loss (to Chanel Imans libidinous Lily) jamming in the home studio of a rich kid (Quincy Brown) fleeing a fast-food-joint shootout and just making it to an appointment with a Harvard interviewer (Roger Guenveur Smith). After that mess the kids decide they might as well sell the drugs themselves using a hacker/dealer/wigger Will (Blake Anderson) to show them the ropes and choosing Bitcoin as their legality-evading transaction payment. By the time that scheme has gone viral (as does the protags band via YouTube) the helmers freewheeling screenplay has cheerfully snapped any remaining tether to reality. At this point a movie hitherto crammed to the gills with incident overcompensates by doing a little too much preachy telling rather than showing in its last stretch as if it werent already obvious that its heart is in the right place -- as opposed to you know the blithely pro-drug-dealing wrong place. But the fun momentum of ""Dopes"" breakneck plotting and snappy dialogue easily overcome any momentary attack of earnestness. The cast drawn from comedy rap TV modeling and other spheres is sharply on form throughout as is Famuyiwas direction; the pics esprit is amplified by every editorial trick in the book from split-screen to freeze-frames. Rachel Morrisons widescreen lensing provides plenty of equally antic eye candy abetted by colorful design contributions. The crowded various-artists soundtrack is first-rate not least the couple songs allegedly created by the protags punk trio Oreo.

Angelica Brown says June 29 2015 at 621 am Pharrell did a great job with this sound track My favorite song is track 6 ""Dont Get Deleted"" Reply Ella says June 22 2015 at 507 am A couple of lazy errors on this review. To name a few The kids didnt gleefully decide to sell drugs the name of the band is called Awreeoh and Kravitzs hair was braided not cornrowed. The only disappointment I had was with the marketing. This movie was incredibly enjoyable to watch and far from what I expected or gleaned from the previews. Dope was Dope Go see it. Reply Vanessa says May 12 2015 at 725 pm This movie looks extremely corny amp; predictable why does going to college amp; having goals make you a loser? The whole thing looks stupid amp; I wish people would stop comparing it to The Woods or Boyz N the Hood I bet the nerd gets the girl or realize he has feelings for his boyish looking friend whos actually a girl Reply ba says June 8 2015 at 1223 am ""why does going to college amp; having goals make you a loser"" THEY IN HIGH SCHOOL Those types of attitude are common especially when you go to high school in tougher neighborhoods. Reply chris says June 1 2015 at 526 am I just saw it and Im telling you know you couldnt be any further from the truth. This is NOT a cliche film. Its possibly the best hood film I have seen since the 90s Reply Jesse says May 5 2015 at 1009 am Good review but they didnt ""decide"" to sell the drugs. AJ coerced him by making a thinly veiled threat to Malcolms friends and family. You could tell that it wasnt something he wanted to do. As such the film doesnt glorify drug dealing. Reply Amelia says January 26 2015 at 1202 am I was very excited for this film but came away pretty disappointed. The acting was pretty unbearable and a lot of the jokes felt forced. The plot was so meandering with a lot unnecessary scenes. I was bored for much of the film. The ending was also incredibly preachy. Its all such a shame because I think somewhere in this mess is really great idea for a film this just wasnt it. Reply Spike says January 25 2015 at 118 am more stupid s--t Reply Thomas says January 25 2015 at 235 pm Nope its actually pretty great. Good try though. Reply Vanessa says May 12 2015 at 726 pm No Thomas Spike is right.
