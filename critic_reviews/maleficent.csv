By Anthony Lane Angelina Jolie and Elle Fanning in the latest version of the Sleeping Beauty story.   Credit Illustration by Victor Melamed For centuries the myth of Sleeping Beauty has tossed and turned. In Charles Perraults version of 1697 the happy ending was not an ending at all; it led to an aftermath flavored with serial cannibalism writhing vipers and slit throats. Italo Calvino collecting Italian folktales dug up an old Calabrian variant in which the prince does not wake the heroine but rapes and impregnates her in her sleep. For some reason none of this made it into the Disney film of 1959. As for the fairy villain Perrault did not name her; nor did the Brothers Grimm in ""Little Briar-Rose"" their retelling of 1812. Disney however which never lost money by spelling things out called her Maleficent something of a giveaway you might think although the other characters seemed taken aback when she rolled up to the christening of the princess and started raging about spinning wheels and death instead of handing over a Tiffany feeding spoon and a couple of bibs from Bonpoint. No surprise then that like the Queen in ""Snow White"" or Cruella De Vil in ""101 Dalmatians"" she commandeered the story. But does she need a movie to herself? There is only one reason to see ""Maleficent"" but it is a very good reason indeed and that is Angelina Jolie. She takes the title role and plays with it--teasing out every strand of sadism defiance and ennui and perhaps reflecting on what further strands might have been available within a claws reach were this not another Disney production. Her speech is brisk and British with overtones of Kristin Scott Thomas and the icy abruptness with which she says ""Oh"" upon learning of the babys birth would not have disgraced the pages of Evelyn Waugh. On her back is a pair of enormous wings; finding them plucked off one morning she gives an overwhelming howl of loss and grief. More resilient are the curving horns on her head; at the screening I attended the audience was offered the plastic equivalent which I regretfully declined so as not to block the view of the person behind me. And they work only when teamed with satanically red lipstick which I didnt have on me at the time. Plus you need the cheekbones. Jolie has many co-stars. Sam Riley is her sidekick who can adopt the form of a dragon a raven or a wolf; Sharlto Copley is her nemesis the king of a neighboring land; and the part of Sleeping Beauty never easy goes to Elle Fanning whose expression tirelessly seraphic suggests that she is raising funds in a charity smile-a-thon. The contributor who matters most though is Rick Baker. He was the presiding genius of movie makeup in pre-digital days winning seven Oscars and anybody who saw Michael Jackson groove with the undead in ""Thriller"" was looking at Bakers handiwork. Jolies cheekbones which I thought were designed by Ferrari or Lockheed turn out to be Bakers invention and you feel them slicing through the softness of the film. Try stroking Maleficent on the face and youd wind up with bloody fingers. Children will not forget her in a hurry. Would that the rest of the movie followed suit. The rule is that Disney cartoons are mettlesome and taut whereas Disney live-action projects are a meandering mess; who would honestly choose ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" over ""Tangled"" or ""Frozen""? The director of ""Maleficent"" is Robert Stromberg and the screenplay is by Linda Woolverton who wrought her narrative magic on ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""The Lion King""; but having started the new movie at a trot they reach the baptismal curse and come to a juddering halt. The problem as with so many fairy tales is the weight of time. If you are Perrault or the Grimms you merely say ""Years passed"" and leap to the next enchanted event but ""Maleficent"" takes the risky decision to hang around for those years waiting for the princess to grow up and padding out numerous scenes with the doings of farcical fairies. The music by James Newton Howard gives little propulsion but then any composer is going to suffer next to Tchaikovsky whose ballet score was so unblushingly pinched by Disney in 1959. The result was orchestra-powered aided by the heraldic simplicity of the animation. The design of the new movie by contrast has that over-busy cram-every-corner relentlessness that infected Tim Burtons ""Alice in Wonderland"" in 2010 and Maleficents forest lair which should be a haven of ominous quietude is a pulsating traffic jam of tree monsters and trolls. Again it is Jolie who saves the day and brings on the night. There are wonderful shots of her emerald eyes gazing at the princess from the shadows all the creepier for being so calm. But why is she gazing? What has the movie done to her and to the armored gleam of her wickedness? The news is bleak Maleficent far from being arrested for stalking a minor begins to think better of her plans. Why she even takes a fancy to the noble little brat She might as well go the whole hog and change her name to Benevolent. Such a transformation would of course be wholly in line with the tender niceties on which unlike the Brothers Grimm we pride ourselves and ""Maleficent"" is hardly alone in its revisionist urge. I would wager that it sprang from a night at the theatre when a row of movie executives noted the crowds flocking to ""Wicked""--a musical about the good heart that beat inside the bad witch from ""The Wizard of Oz""--and dreamed of similar gold. Where this maddened hunt for backstories will lead I dread to think. Will the sisters in Disneys latest version of ""Cinderella"" already pencilled in for next year stay ugly to the end? Will the wolf help the three little pigs to build a communal living space eco-friendly and resistant to both huffs and puffs? The notion that evil can and should be redeemed not punished smacks of moral progress; but kids who like their villains to be vanquished may have other ideas. Set in Arizona in 1882 ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" stars Seth MacFarlane as Albert Stark. Albert is a poor sheep farmer with a yellow belly and limited prospects so its no surprise when his sweetheart Louise (Amanda Seyfried) leaves him for Foy (Neil Patrick Harris) a dandy with cash and a rococo mustache. Albert has a best friend Edward (Giovanni Ribisi) a God-fearing type who is betrothed to a prostitute named Ruth (Sarah Silverman). Also present are Liam Neeson as a black-hearted gunslinger called Clinch and Charlize Theron who plays Anna his long-suffering wife. So the cast is in fine shape; the grandeur of the landscapes is well caught by the cinematographer Michael Barrett with many a nod to John Ford; and the soundtrack by Joel McNeely kicks off with a big generous pastiche of an old-school Western theme. As it fades at the end of the opening credits the scene is set. Then the film happens. Here are some of the subjects with which it grapples death by flatulence the pains of anal sex (""Im going to rest my asshole"") and a hatful of diarrhea. Do you notice a common theme? Picture an entire movie spawned by the campfire scene from ""Blazing Saddles"" and youre almost there. All this will speak to your soul no doubt if you are a twelve-year-old boy who believes the bathroom to be the funniest place on earth but what about the rest of us? Fear not for MacFarlane--who co-wrote and co-produced the film as well as starring in it--has joys in store for those of more cultivated tastes. There are gags about retarded sheep Chinese immigrants the halitosis that follows a blow job and the precise appearance of the pudenda after a spell in the sex trade. As is his wont MacFarlane is daring us to be disgusted; and should we flinch his movie will mock us for being prim--the worst of all crimes in his scabrous world. But what if were just bored? Stuck in the foul mire are a few good scenes. I liked the idea that Edward and Ruth are chaste with each other saving themselves for marriage even while she is servicing fifteen clients a day; the joke keeps coming back however growing less amusing with each repeat. Thats the thing about running gags eventually they stagger and collapse. The same goes for the historical observations--the fact that nobody smiled in nineteenth-century photographs or Annas admission that she was a child bride because ""I just didnt want to end up like one of those fifteen-year-old spinsters."" Here we approach the nub of MacFarlanes argument his bold contention that in Annas words ""the West fucking sucks"" with its army of diseases its wretched life expectancy and what Albert calls its ""general depressing awfulness."" Yet what is most depressing about the film is not the low strike rate of its zingers or what Freudians will diagnose as its anal fixation so typical of the infant mind but the comic complacency. Albert may be spineless but that is nothing new; it is more than sixty years since Bob Hope put a coward among the cowboys in ""The Paleface."" And does Seth MacFarlane think that he is the first to notice how grim conditions were in the great drive westward that he alone can puncture the myth of that adventure or that his gang of neer-do-wells is the wildest bunch of all? Tell it to Sam Peckinpah.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Its the most basic part of the tale full stop. The challenge is to show how she got so blinded by rage that shed get to that point. Not to make her actions excusable just to let the audience feel her pain and see the rage it spawned. Maybe youre right in that an audience would be more willing to forgive her because shes female but Ill put forth that even if you had a normal human man and did something equivalent - say cut off his legs leaving him a double amputee having to drag himself around with his arms done by a former lover who just wanted to get rich and score herself a trophy husband - I think the audience would still identify with his pain and understand his rage. Not forgive it - but understand it. Lastly theres a quote that I read once and immediately saved as it really resonated with me. And it applies just as well here. --------- ""It is rarely said but post-traumatic stress disorder can turn you into a horrible person. I found its old name ""shell shock"" strangely fitting. Not because I had ever seen action - the poems of Wilfred Owen do not count - but because that was how I felt. Like a soft gelatinous wobbly little thing surrounded by a hard shell of fury."" --------- Jo Kaysaid on Sunday July 06 2014 81120 AMOne of the best movie Ive ever seeing. Joly was extraordinary Msaid on Tuesday July 01 2014 32318 PMComplete disagree with the review...the visual effects were stunning but the way the backstory was built into the original tale was fantastic. Maybe I thought too much as a kid but this movie masterfully filled gaping holes of the fairy tale that I perceived as a child...like the fact that evil does not develop inside for no reason. In this case the king stole a treasured piece of Maleficent and she returned the dark favor. My favorite part was the backstory for the reason the caveat was placed into the curse...a personal jab to the king directly spawned by the kings specific betrayal of Maleficent...TRUE LOVEs KISS. And further depth is added by both Maleficents and the kings perception of impending doom because neither believes that it true love even exists due to their own experience...together. But then there is also an important re-calibration of what ""true love"" truly means...and it goes way beyond the superficial version taught to our daughters in the original version of the tale. There are so many psychological (as well as morally realistic) layers in this film but you have to leave your traditional princess expectations as well as your rose-tinted fairy tale glasses home in order to perceive them...which I think is part of the point of the film. Its not a more mature version of the fairy tale just because of the creepy special effects. chris wellssaid on Sunday June 29 2014 104351 AMIts also highly sexist to take an evil woman and conveniently blame her evil doing on a man. In no movie would an evil man attempting to murder an innocent get sympathy because he was hurt by his lover. Daniel Plazasaid on Thursday June 26 2014 22952 PMMr. Roeper I am so happy you gave this movie a D because I honestly felt too disappointed with it. Many stuff I agree with you as well as more problems why this movie doesnt deserve too much praise just because is Disney. I stick with the cartoon film. Mark Staffordsaid on Sunday June 15 2014 74118 PMI really enjoyed this movie. Angelina Jolie is great as Maleficent and the visuals are outstanding. Why is Maleficent ticked off? Something very significant is stolen from her. Damion Gibsonsaid on Thursday June 12 2014 72520 PMGotta disagree with you on this one Richard. Maleficent is a childrens story to begin with so it shouldnt be put to the same flames as say an X-Men for adults. What they did with this story is breathe new life into an old tale that many of us enjoyed in our youth. Angelina Jolies performance was chilling but warranted as she was playing a sinister evil. The main theme I retrieved from this film was that it was a story of a woman scorned. If the Stefan would have just done right maybe her heart wouldnt have turned so cold. Overall it was a warm story that one could watch with children or with other ""Big"" kids..lol I would have given this at least a B for the visuals and interesting spin on a classic JJ Abeytasaid on Wednesday June 11 2014 20622 AMI enjoyed the movie overall but it is pretty flawed. Please stop reading this if you havent seen the movie cause Im going to do a couple spoilers. But come on Aroura found out her ""godmother"" Maleficent cast a spell that was going to kill her when she turns 16 for something HER FATHER DID not her. Yet she was so quick to forgive her...why? Yes you can make an argument that Maleficent became more of a parent to her than anyone else thereby loving her like her own daughter yes you can say she tried to stop it from happening BUT IT WOULDNT HAVE HAPPEN IN THE FIRST PLACE IF IT WASNT FOR HER. Is Aroura too dumb to get that? Plus Leslie Davis I dont think I would call the King Stefan not ""King Phillp"" as you referred to him ""evil."" Of course he was the antagonist he was totally selfish and greedy but not exactly evil. If he truly was evil he would of thought nothing of actually killing Maleficent instead he just took her wings to make the first dying king think he killed her. Truthfully in my opinion casting a spell on a young child that would of killed her even though she did nothing wrong is WAY more evil than anything the king/father Stefan did just my option. Robsaid on Saturday June 07 2014 112932 PMI dont think he actually saw the movie. The sleep lasts all of 5 minutes. And he doesnt know what Maleficent is ticked off about? Really? You dont remember that little (HUGE) detail? Lizsaid on Friday June 06 2014 101107 PMLooks like you just give bad reviews to good movies for publicity. Well sorry but its not working. And maybe next time back up your critiques because saying being raised by three women is creepy isnt really sounding too great for ya..

Review Maleficent Is a Predictable 3-D Wonder But Should We Expect More From Angelina Jolie? Eric Kohn May 30 2014 1214 pm erickohn Share This Article Pin It Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Print Talk It doesnt take long for ""Maleficent"" Disneys snazzy 3-D update to ""Sleeping Beauty"" featuring Angelina Jolie as the forlorn villainess to unite its two strongest ingredients the special effects and the star who compliments them. After a colorful prologue in which the titular fairy grows up in the wondrous outskirts of a kingdom the character grows up to become the reigning figure of a fantastical world constantly at odds with the warmongering humans across the way. Director Robert Stromberg--making his feature-length debut after an impressive effects career with credits ranging from ""Pans Labyrinth"" to ""Life of Pi""-- doesnt skimp on the vibrant imagery that brings Maleficients world of oddball J.R.R. Tolkien-like figures with talking trees and giddy pixies swirling about a mystical land. But the chief special effect is no less than Jolie herself portraying the winged creature with a stern gaze that supersedes her supernatural abilities. When in the midst of a showdown with the kingdoms army early on Maleficient sports an evil grin as her beastly forces rise up from the ground and flank her in battle and Stromberg pauses for a majestic closeup of his powerful anti-hero. Her radiant cheekbones and menacing smirk induce more chills in eye-popping 3-D than any of the marvelous visuals preceding them. Angelina Jolie doesnt play Maleficient so much as Maleficient plays her. But the movie tries to offer a little more than that a revised storyline in which Maleficient gets her wings clipped by the only human she thinks she can trust (Sharlto Copley) so he can use them as an excuse to impress his dying father and become the next king. Traumatized by the incident Maleficient curses the kings daughter--thatd be the sleeping beauty curse--only to grow enamored of the young woman in her teen years (when shes portrayed by a stilted Elle Fanning) and struggle with regret. Like ""Frozen"" this Disney update to a classic Brothers Grimm tale represents one more blatant stab at a progressive approach to politically-correct fantasy in which the prince is no longer a panacea. (Even so it still casts its main female character as a lunatic driven to disastrous acts of vengeance by a self-interested dude.) Mainly though its a technological marvel starring the worlds biggest celebrity the full weight of Hollywood spectacle incarnate. However ""Maleficient"" marks a dispiriting move for Jolie. Her career as an action star kicked off with ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" took on its strongest manifestations in ""Salt"" and ""Wanted"" and has always contained a streak of innovation. Watching Jolie kick and blast her way to victory it was impossible not to see her feats as an active metaphor for the process of achieving radical change within the restrictions of the studio system. Not only was she a female action star but she associated with original concepts. Viewed alongside her two feature-length directing efforts the impressively grim Serbian war drama ""In the Land of Blood and Honey"" and the upcoming ""Unbroken"" the story of an Olympic runner taken prisoner by Japanese forces during WWII Jolies latest career path is nearly subversive an attempt to utilize her fame in service of smarter projects and serious ideas. ""Maleficent"" is like the dime store version of that effort. Its a dazzling showcase of fantasy-based filmmaking in the 21st century that also manages a feeble attempt at injecting feminist politics into an antiquated narrative. Yet its eventual climax strains from the obviousness of these efforts as if the filmmakers decided to forgo storytelling cohesiveness in favor of its forward-leaning implications. At the end of the day its another franchise effort in fancy clothing. This should come as no surprise Hollywood has never been a haven for subtlety. But anyone impressed by Jolies capacity to make the business bend to her will should expect more. Its impossible to consider the possibilities at Jolies disposal without also analyzing the similar career trajectory found with her partner Brad Pitt. The other half of the worlds biggest celebrity coupling pre-Kim and Kanye has managed to inject topicality and intelligence into the blockbuster formula with ""World War Z"" which was guided to fruition by his Plan B Entertainment the same company that threw its weight behind ""12 Years a Slave."" Yet no matter how much clout Pitt carries its Jolie who has the superior screen presence as her majestic closeups in ""Maleficient"" prove to a fault. Rather than associating with Disneys transparent stabs at updating its library of stories Jolies presence is better-served with material that could use her influence complex challenging narratives that push back on assumptions about the dominant tendencies of commercial cinema by making it more adult-friendly. This isnt an outrageous demand; as a filmmaker Jolie has shown a sophistication that none of her recent roles have offered up since her turn in Michael Winterbottoms ""A Mighty Heart"" a flawed but engaging real-world narrative that provided the first indication of the sort of stories she would eventually tell from behind the camera. That was seven years ago. Perhaps the actress could take some tips from her directorial instincts and leave the realm of juvenile stories to the factories obsessed with making them. Grade C+ ""Maleficent"" opens nationwide today. Check out more reactions from the Criticwire Network.

Not by Brothers Grimm. Reply Daniel Delago May 12 2016 1143 am Angelina Jolies screen presence is as powerful as her characters sorcery. By the way you need to use spell check for your movie reviews. Her name is MALEFICENT not Maleficient. Reply Dennis May 12 2016 1143 am I like the style of this review. When a star makes a film it is an extension of that stars onscreen persona. The movie itself matters not as much as the carrer. In the same way that Kerouac saw every book as a chapter in a large work. Reply jawsnnn May 12 2016 1143 am 1. Frozen was not an update of a brothers Grimm story (it was written by Nathaniel Hawthorne). 2. The review is essentially flawed in that it completely focusses on Angelina Jolies career trajectory. What was the movie like? What flaws did the story have? If it was too revisionist why is that a problem? There is no information on these points here? Why should I trust a review which tells me nothing about the movie and everything I already know about Ms. Jolies career? Reply Marc Schenker May 12 2016 1143 am No Ms. Jolie has yet to give it to us. It is the big fact of her career. A woman who many looked to as the next Streep (perhaps after Girl Interrupted) has never given us the Big Drama or for that matter the Big Comedy. Its as if she has toyed with her career never really taking it seriously thinking perhaps that she is too beautiful to be taken seriously. Well she put on the uniform in The Bone Collector and instead of looking a bit silly outshined Denzel Washington. Still waiting Angelina. Reply ze May 12 2016 1143 am Her career as an action star kicked off with Tomb Raider... Reply annie May 12 2016 1143 am but her entire career has pretty much been horrible movies hasnt it? if Salt and Wanted are her best stuff thats not saying much. i honestly think shes going to be remembered much more for her tabloid status and everything she did off camera much more than her actual filmography. Reply James M. May 12 2016 1143 am Hmmmm. Eric youre way off base here. Jolie herself said she made this movie because she needed something light and fun after the drama of her philanthropic efforts. She also did it for her children. Youre basically saying Jolie is too good for the material and while you may be right but your job as a critic is to review the movie you saw not tell us the kind of movie you wish Jolie had made (Ebert 101).

Its the pictures that got small.""Now to state the obvious Angelina Jolie is about as distant from a washed-up Norma Desmond as it is possible to be on the celebrity-relevance spectrum. And her new vehicle Maleficent is not small in the traditional sense but rather in the increasingly common contemporary sense yet another in a string of gazillion-dollar special-effects extravaganzas grafted onto flimsy nonsensical scripts and featuring an array of two-dimensional performances.Related Story The Cyclical Darkness of Fairy Tales Still the old line from Sunset Boulevard cant help but resonate. Jolie is after all big in the way that silent film stars were big before the talkies swept them away. And as one of a tiny number of female stars who can open a major movie herself she all too often finds her charisma swallowed up by the hubbub of blockbuster filmmaking the stunts the effects the desperate pursuit of scale and velocity.What was Jolies last genuinely memorable role? The Tourist? Salt? Changeling? She sauntered through her effortless brand of sexual cool in Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith as well as in supporting roles in Wanted Beowulf and Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. And of course she voices a tiger in the Kung Fu Panda movies. For an indisputably A-list actress it adds up to an awful lot of B-list roles. Indeed unlike fellow cinematic icons such as her quasi-spouse Brad Pitt and his pal George Clooney Jolie seems almost to have transcended her film career altogether. Acting often looks as though its an occasional sideline to her day job the no doubt taxing business of being Angelina Jolie.Maleficent was intended to remedy this to reestablish Jolie center-stage playing a villainess as iconic as herself. Alas Disneys subversive retelling of its own 1959 animated classic Sleeping Beauty is an utter mess. At once overblown and under-baked the movie is a morally and tonally confused collection of sequences that never cohere into a compelling story.Robert Stromberg makes his directorial debut with the film and it will surprise precisely no one who sees it that he comes from the world of special effects. (Stromberg won art direction Oscars for Avatar and Alice in Wonderland and worked on last years Oz the Great and Powerful among others.) From its opening frames Maleficent is crammed with CGI wonders Ent-like warrior-trees mushroomy gnomes acre after acre of blossoming Technicolor jungle. There are beautiful elements here and there but they are piled so thick upon one another that they quickly become visually exhausting. Moreover a sameness seems to be creeping into even the most accomplished CGI artistry Do I recognize that particular magical forest creature from the Lord of the Rings? Narnia? Snow White and the Huntsman? Im not certain but I know Ive seen it somewhere before.The tale that unfolds in front of this backdrop is an inversion of Charles Perraults classic folk tale told from the perspective of its antagonist a la Wicked or John Gardners novel Grendel. It begins with a young Maleficent already the most powerful of the fairies--her magnificent wings are a sight to behold half-bat half-eagle--becoming friends with a human boy Stefan. Their fates are complicated however when the human king declares war on the land of the fairies--cue the requisite effects-laden battle between armored soldiers and fantastical woodland beasts--and then promises his throne to any man who will destroy Maleficent (now played in adulthood by Jolie).Stefan has always been an ambitious fellow. (We know this because weve been told so in voiceover--more on this later.) So the young man now played by South African actor Sharlto Copley visits his old friend Maleficent to reminisce over old times and then dose her with a potion that renders her unconscious (yes a fairy-tale roofie). When the moment comes to kill her however he relents instead severing her beautiful wings and taking them with him as an offering to the king. Maleficent awakes screaming betrayed defiled mutilated her most wondrous gift torn from her. (Have I mentioned yet that this is not really a kids film?)From here the story unfolds along more familiar lines Years later Stefan now the king and his wife have a beautiful baby daughter Aurora; at her christening Maleficent shows up wreathed in green flame to curse the child that on her 16th birthday she will prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and fall into a deathlike sleep from which she can be awakened only by the kiss of true love; in fear for her safety the king sends Aurora away to be raised incognito by three dim but gentle fairies (Imelda Staunton Juno Temple and Lesley Manville as respectively Flora Knotgrass Fauna Thistlewit and Merryweather Flittle).This middle section of the film abandons its dark early vision almost entirely instead offering heavy doses of feeble fairy slapstick. Maleficent mellows too playing practical jokes on her fairy cousins and gradually warming to Aurora as she grows into girlhood (and is now played by Elle Fanning). Unlike Disneys earlier telling in this version far from losing track of Aurora Maleficent watches over her as a kind of Bizarro fairy godmother. But as the girl reaches her 16th birthday darkness again encroaches....The plot is frequently nudged forward by long bouts of expository narration suggesting that considerable stretches of footage may have wound up on the cutting room floor.There were reports of difficulties during Maleficents production (tension between Jolie and Stromberg; late reshoots that brought in John Lee Hancock director of The Blind Side and Saving Mr. Banks) and the final product feels like a grab bag of disjointed ideas awkwardly stitched together. The rape/revenge theme that sets the plot in motion is exceedingly grim and coexists uneasily with the stabs at comedy that punctuate the middle third. The result is neither a brooding arty grown-up fairy tale (like say Neil Jordans The Company of Wolves) nor a particularly kid-friendly one but instead an uncomfortable commingling of the two. By would-be blockbuster standards the film is rather short (just 96 minutes) and its plot is frequently nudged forward by long bouts of expository narration suggesting that considerable stretches of footage may have wound up on the cutting room floor. Perhaps most peculiar of all a central twist of the film--I wont say what it is but youll recognize it if you see it--is virtually identical to that of another better Disney film that was released only last year.Jolie does what she can in the title role flashing wicked grins and sporting cheekbones so sharp and jutting that one could juice oranges on them. But the script (by Linda Woolverton) complicates Maleficent without deepening her. As a cameo Jolies performance might have proven spectacular; but as a protagonist she doesnt give us enough to hold onto. For all her efforts she remains yet another special effect however spectacular.The rest of the cast fares far worse. Fanning is pretty but forgettable as Aurora and Copleys Stefan is even more testily over-the-top than the assassin played by the actor in last summers Elysium. And the less said of Staunton Temple and Manvilles bumbling CGI-ified fairies the happier all three actresses will no doubt be. Of the supporting players only Sam Riley (Control) who plays the humanoid version of Maleficents raven familiar Diaval comes out of the film looking better than he did going in.So whats next for Jolie? Kung Fu Panda 3 is due out next year. And Salt 2 (cmon guys at least have the ironic sense to title it SALT II) is scheduled to follow sometime on its heels. Jolie will always be big. But if anything her pictures seem to be getting ever smaller.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

Grade C If the towering sorceress with the Satanic horns had started life as a benevolent sprite why did her parents name her Maleficent a word that means doing harm? That question wont be answered in ""Maleficent"" a cruelly unimaginative live-action makeover of Walt Disneys 1959 feature cartoon ""Sleeping Beauty."" The script credited to Linda Woolverton dully reverses the good and evil figures in the story so for example the three good fairies become dolts and the dragon a heroic force. The direction by first-timer Robert Stromberg misfires whenever it veers away from Angelina Jolie who plays Maleficent. Stromberg is an acclaimed effects specialist and production designer. So its doubly disappointing that he turns his big set pieces into visual grab bags stuffed with familiar critters - frog-like beasts who look like miniature versions of Jabba the Hutt and virtuous tree-like giants out of Tolkien whose bark of course is worse than their bite. With cheekbones augmented so they look ready to cut glass Jolie is the main attraction. She gets to sport the kind of turbaned headwear favored by 1940s movie stars - think Lana Turner in ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" - plus those devilish twisting horns. Mixing femme fatale and grand dame Jolie has the wit to play Maleficent as a pagan power even after she practices faith hope and charity. She out-classes the movie. In our post-""Wicked"" fantasy universe where every old-time wicked witch must turn out to be misunderstood ""Maleficent"" presents side by side an atrocious human kingdom and a blissful fairyland known as ""the Moors"" where Maleficent enjoys a glorious winged youth. Innocent and open to experience she falls in love with a human farmers son named Stefan after he ventures into her neck of the woods. Unfortunately the greedy bellicose humans - I should say ""men"" because in this film the bad guys are bad guys - envy their neighbors and periodically try to wipe them out. During one such war the adult Stefan (Sharlto Copley) reappears in the Moors after years of absence. After lulling Maleficent into sleep he cuts off her wings - a deed that will elevate the farmers son to king. Soon this twisted monarch and his blushing bride Leila (Hannah New) the old kings daughter have a daughter of their own Aurora. Maleficent crashes the christening to deliver her curse - ""before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday she will prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and fall into a sleep like death."" (That blooming young beauty Elle Fanning plays Aurora at 16.) Astonishingly this film isnt satisfied with portraying Maleficent as a wronged woman bent on revenge. With the help of her amiable sidekick (Sam Riley) a raven that changes shape at her command Maleficent comes to love protect and nurture Aurora. Is it worth rehabilitating Maleficent if it means throwing every other adult character - including Auroras parents - under the revisionist bus? King Stefan is loathsome Leila is a pretty nonentity and the three pixies they charge with caring for Aurora turn out to be nattering fools. All would be forgiven if the film had more magical feeling. Sadly only one image rouses the otherworldly delight you expect from any fairy tale updated or otherwise Maleficent levitates Aurora in a trance and compels her body to follow as she strides into the Moors. Funny and moving its the simplest effect and the best. As Aurora floats on her back while Maleficent walks ahead of her Jolies magnetic presence makes you think that she could pull Aurora along by willpower alone. Its the one time in ""Maleficent"" that you believe in magic.

Frank Connor/Disney/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The 25 best animated movies of all time - readers picks Monitor Movie Guide Who would imagine that Walt Disney Studios would go revisionist? ""Maleficent"" updates the ""Sleeping Beauty"" fable it famously animated in 1959 and gives it a quasi-feminist touchy-feely twist. The big bad Maleficent played in the movie by Angelina Jolie with curvy horns and cheekbones that could cut through solid steel is given a sympathetic back story to explain all that nastiness. Princess Aurora (Elle Fanning) upon whom Maleficent placed a curse in a fit of vengeful pique has become a rather ga-ga maiden tended by a trio of pixies (Imelda Staunton is the standout). Director Robert Stromberg making his debut as a director after supervising the visual effects for movies like ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""Avatar"" lacks the transcendent touch. At least Disney was smart enough to cast Jolie. She has a genuinely heroic presence. If only the movie were equal to it.

Theres definitely a quality of too-muchness about ""Maleficent"" which marks the directing debut of veteran visual-effects whiz Robert Stromberg like eating all your Halloween candy in one go. At least its delicious candy; much of the movie is set in a storybook fairyland gradually edging into darkness - the world of ""The Princess Bride"" colonized by Mordor - and the rest in a corrupted royal household out of ""Game of Thrones.""By far the biggest and most effective special effect in ""Maleficent"" however is the queenly and sarcastic Angelina Jolie in the title role as a betrayed and vengeful fairy princess who will wow tween girls by the zillions. Yes Jolies statuesque figure and remarkable face have been augmented with digital magic. Her real cheekbones although impressive are not that exaggerated; that unearthly green glitter in her eyes is artificial; she does not actually have horns. But the regal posture the internalized pain and injured pride the pantomime-villainess English accent - those things are all Jolie and its great to see her having fun in a starring role again and doing some good along the way. Yeah I said that and Im sticking to it At the end of an exceptionally tough week for women and girls in America this pop-feminist retelling of a classic yarn arrives as a surprisingly relevant symbolic antidote.I totally get why many of my fellow critics are giving ""Maleficent"" mediocre grades Its a stylistic mishmash and almost everything in it resembles one or another of the numerous fantasy movies and TV series of the last 15 years. But Disneys target audience for this picture is not middle-aged journalists. Its tween and early-teen girls who are ready to move half a click upward from ""Frozen"" and ""Brave"" along with their moms. That audience is going to be absolutely thrilled by this slightly subversive fable of revenge and female solidarity - I cannot wait to take my 10-year-old daughter -- and truth be told a lot of the brothers boyfriends and dads who claim they dont want to come along will enjoy it a lot too.Veteran Disney screenwriter Linda Woolverton has a practiced hand with this genre and this audience (she wrote ""Beauty and the Beast"" ""The Lion King"" and Tim Burtons ""Alice in Wonderland"") but this movie feels especially like a labor of love. Its easy to criticize the Mouse House for its ideological and aesthetic crimes over the decades and Im always eager to do so. But in the John Lasseter era Disneys films have made a concerted effort to depict female characters in a different light as the protagonists of their own stories rather than virginal innocents quest-objects happy homemakers and scheming bitch-witches. Dont get me wrong -- ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" is a great movie and a landmark in animation history. But whats the first thing Snow White does when she moves into the dwarfs disgusting bachelor pad? The dishes. You Might Also Like Maleficent aint doing the goddamn dishes. Played as a girl by Isobelle Molloy and then by Ella Purnell this fairy princess makes the dire mistake of falling hard for a boy named Stefan from the adjoining human kingdom plagued of course by corruption and mendacity. This ends not just in heartbreak but also in a terrible act of betrayal a metaphorical rape that abruptly darkens the mood of the film. There are numerous ways to interpret what happens between Stefan and Maleficent On one side tiresome people may claim this movie is teaching girls to hate and fear boys; others (equally tiresome) may see it as an argument for chastity and a rejection of todays promiscuous whateverness. A simpler reading is also available Girls shouldnt draw their self-worth from guys and promises of true love while seductive in the moment should not be relied upon. (Also more practical If the dude dumps you and then comes back? Dont fall for it.)After committing this terrible deed Stefan rises to the throne of his kingdom and has a daughter; as you may remember from earlier tellings of the tale Maleficent shows up uninvited at the christening with an unexpected gift. We know where all this is going or we mostly do. But Jolie dominates every scene she appears in even when the story reverts to formula and Woolvertons screenplay has a few more tricks up its sleeve. Its perfectly true that Elle Fanning makes little impression in the flattened-out role of Aurora (aka Sleeping Beauty) and that Sharlto Copley as the hollowed-out adult King Stefan is demonic gleam and not much else. But neither of them is the storys real hero real villain or true heart. Thats all Jolie and I wouldnt surrender a second of this performance for anything. Not her stony shocked (and hilarious) ""What?"" when Aurora joyfully burbles ""Youre my fairy godmother"" Not the way Maleficent calls the girl ""Beastie"" first in a spirit of bemused scientific dismissal and then with a growing affection she tries but fails to disguise. I could definitely live without the trio of comical-cute fairies played by Lesley Manville Imelda Staunton and Juno Temple (although I suspect theyll be popular with younger viewers). But whatever its flaws ""Maleficent"" is a family-friendly Disney adventure that offers a relaunched and thoroughly delightful Angelina Jolie that suggests romantic love is often a trap and that proposes that the families we build and discover as we grow up can be more rewarding than the ones were born with.

Frank Connor/Disney hide caption toggle caption Frank Connor/Disney Maleficent rehabilitates the most maligned figure in the fairy tale canon. Frank Connor/Disney Of all Disney heroines Aurora aka Sleeping Beauty was the least inspiring. Not her fault How much spark can you wring from a Forever Nap especially one thats cut off by a kiss from a prince named after the Duke of Edinburgh? Which may be why my 16-year-old whos going through one of those inexplicable regressions into Disney toddler fare that seem to hit girls in their teens and beyond made it through all of five minutes of the 1959 Sleeping Beauty then went back to binge-watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer. But my girl really grooved to Maleficent and in a rare confluence of intergenerational pop taste so did I. And after all whats not to like when the spotlight shifts to the (allegedly) wicked fairy as channeled through the bone structure of Angelina Jolie? I say allegedly because Maleficent capably directed by Robert Stromberg from a sharp script by Linda Woolverton (who also wrote Disneys Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King) sets out to explain why the chilly lady turned into such a hater. Thats a very American question The vibrantly pre-Freudian Brothers Grimm who wrote the 1812 Briar Rose story that built on Charles Perraults 1697 original tale regarded both evil and good as immutable character traits that needed no explanation. The battle between them was the story. Maleficent muddies those waters in ways that may upset moviegoers looking for visceral action though it surely doesnt lack for battle scenes. At its core the film wants us rooting for the bad fairy and to push things a little further to suggest that humans make much more natural evildoers than their ethereal neighbors especially when rendered in 3D. We meet young Maleficent (played by Isobelle Molloy then Ella Purnell) parentless but frolicking happily in The Moors a fairyland landscape more out of Maurice Sendak than the happiest place on Earth. No tweety-birds hopping around this live-action paradise -- only gnarly tree-monsters and wonderful toad-goblins as devoted to their de facto queen as they are terrified of her anger. And why not? Maleficent has two fancy big horns and a massive wingspan that helps her repel invaders from the all-too-human monarchy next door. The Moors by contrast is a democracy that needs no royalty because it functions on mutual trust. Enter Stefan (Sharlto Copley and someone tell me please why is it that so many Disney characters speak Glaswegian these days?) a rank careerist who under cover of sweet nothings brutally reduces poor Maleficents powers then rushes back home to lobby for leadership. Thus is born Maleficent the Avenger now fully grown and ready to crash the christening party of Stefans baby daughter Aurora. You may think you know the rest but watch for all manner of interesting twists beginning with Angelina Jolie who even in jutting cheekbones Spock ears and ruby-red lips set off by the usual deathly pallor is surely the most quietly inscrutable wicked fairy to walk this digital Earth. It hardly matters that Jolies accent rambles a bit between pungent Cockney and plummy Buckingham Palace. Shes a Presence who mostly strides around green eyes a-glitter doing magic things with her long fingers like sending humans flying turning creatures into other creatures the better to do battle and putting dweeby visiting princes to sleep as needed. No wonder Aurora on the cusp of 16 and played as a high-spirited enthusiast by the captivating Elle Fanning is more impressed by Maleficent than she is by the three incompetent good fairies (wittily played by Juno Temple and two actresses better known for playing women of woe in Mike Leigh movies) who cant seem to focus on caring for their young charge. No spoilers here but suffice it to say that Maleficent doesnt just rehabilitate the most maligned figure in the fairy tale canon and place brackets around received notions of naughty and nice. More daringly the movie places a giant question mark around who in all of Fairyland make the mommies dearest or even the fairest lovers of all. We are cautioned not to take this the wrong way -- but blink and you might miss Prince-y (Brenton Thwaites) hovering redundantly over the finale. When you stop to think about the implications of who in this innovative retelling gets to arouse the damsel from her truncated snooze Uncle Walt must surely be shouting ""cut"" from the grave.

And in Robert Strombergs part prequel part revision she gets a chance to expand the dynamic range of this haunting villain She doesnt just cackle and snarl but she also cries gets hurt and has changes of heart. And shes not really the bad guy anymore. When we first meet Maleficent shes a cherubic young girl with wings (and those telltale horns) happily relaxing in a tree in the Moors the kingdom of free and magical spirits who live right next to the royalty-bound kingdom of humans. One day a young human thief named Stefan steals into the Moors and he and Maleficent strike up a friendship. His iron ring burns her skin and he removes it so he can touch her - a gesture that strikes her as exceedingly romantic. Its an elegant and proper irony The fairy tale character most committed to the destruction of true love turns out to have been one of its early victims. Stefan and Maleficents friendship eventually meets with betrayal. Theyve become adults on opposing sides of a war. The dying king of the humans wants to conquer the Moors and he promises his throne to whoever can kill Maleficent and bring her wings back as a trophy. So Stefan drugs his beloved cuts her wings and seizes the throne. Thats right it turns out the real bad guy was King Stefan -- Sleeping Beautys father. Maleficent rocked by his cruelty retreats back into her world and turns the Moors into a dark blasted hellish landscape -- sheltered by a forest of thorns guarded by tree-root warriors and dragons made of dirt. The effects are gorgeous even if they signal something tragic -- the transformation of one of the great fairy tales into another zillion-dollar world-building exercise. At least they could have kept the Tchaikovsky. (Lana Del Reys rendition of the classic song ""Once Upon a Dream"" based on Tchaikovskys ballet does play over the end credits. But by that point the damage is done.) After that the film briefly settles into a re-creation of that original primal moment from the fairy tale and the Disney classic. The uninvited Maleficent crashes the party of the babys christening and puts a curse on the child The girl will prick her finger on a spinning needle on her 16th birthday and die -- a curse soon revised to merely an eternal sleep until true loves kiss awakens her. But the story takes a wildly different route from there. As before three kindly fairies take Princess Aurora under their wing and hide her in the woods for the next 16 years. But Maleficent isnt easily fooled; she finds them instantly. Indeed its our beloved villain -- starting to look more and more like a heroine -- who winds up secretly feeding the child and rocking her to sleep while the three incompetent fairies bicker and goof around. ""I hate you"" Maleficent says to the baby early on in perfect deadpan; as the tot smiles back at her; we know right then that theres no way she will not grow to love this child. Sure enough as Aurora grows up (and is played as a teen by Elle Fanning) the sorceress who had foresworn off love and children and all those beautiful things now realizes she has a soft spot for them. She begins to regret her curse. Of course those of us whove seen Frozen (which I guess is all of us at this point) know that true love need no longer mean what we used to think it means. Ive probably already said too much but its kind of hard not to when discussing what kind of film Maleficent is. In undercutting and reversing her villainy Stromberg and screenwriter Linda Woolverton (who wrote both the wonderful Lion King and the ghastly Tim Burton version of Alice in Wonderland by the way) do find an intriguing new way into the story. But theyre a bit too enamored of their revisionism and they dont quite know what to do with the rest of the tale. Elsewhere Ive argued that weve lost something with Disneys move away from traditional villains in their more recent movies. Maleficent provides a good example In robbing Maleficent of her cruelty the film doesnt really reject the notion of evil -- it merely transfers it to King Stefan (played as an adult by District 9s Sharlto Copley). And he alas is a peculiarly uncharismatic fellow more a delusional and feckless tyrant than somebody whose actions can fuel the elemental terrors and emotions of a fairy tale. Singularly unthreatening he doesnt seem worthy of the betrayal Maleficent feels nor does he seem worthy of the battle she later wages. Princess Aurora is served even worse. Fanning is one of our great young actresses but theres little here for her to do except smile and look on naively. Maybe thats part of the joke -- Sleeping Beauty herself relegated to a glorified bit-part in her own story -- but its hard to buy Maleficents transformation and redemption if Aurora doesnt come alive for us in some way. Jolies commitment to the part is admirable She gives this Maleficent a real emotional urgency. But the rest of the movie lets her down.

Exploring the antecedents and motivations of literatures great villainesses has proved a rich cultural vein restoring the reputations of everyone from Mr. Rochesters mad wife to the Wicked Witch of the West. The approach is such a winner that Disney got into the act opening up its own cupboards to a bit of political spring cleaning Based on both the 19th-century versions of the fairy tale and Disneys own 1959 animated movie Maleficent is a retelling of the Sleeping Beauty myth that reveals the reasons the evil fairy godmother cursed that darling baby in the first place. Angelina Jolie in Maleficent Disney Enterprises Multimedia Meet Rick Baker The legendary artist behind Maleficent and other beloved beasts of film Created by a team of artists with all the credentials to produce a surfeit of CGI the film surprises not for its baroque visions of a colourful woodland enlivened by joyous fairies and a forbidding castle peopled by unhappy humans but rather for the thematic richness of its story gloriously personified by Angelina Jolie in the title role. Her skin is pearly white; her famous lips are a startling red; her cheekbones are honed to Precambrian ridges (by computers Im assuming) and like her 1959 animated predecessor she sports a fine pair of twisting horns welded to her head with a lizard-skin turban.She is a sight to behold but you should have seen her when she had wings. A notably imaginative departure by Disney stalwart Linda Woolverton (The Lion King Alice in Wonderland) the script begins when Maleficent is a young fairy (charmingly played by Isobelle Molloy) with the wings of an eagle. She soars around a little paradise full of frolicking fairies nymphs and wood spirits whose only fear is of the hateful humans who live beyond their forest.Meeting a human boy who strays into this perfect world Maleficent falls in love. But the boy grows into an ambitious man who viciously betrays her so that he can tame the fairies and become king. And it is when this increasingly violent King Stefan (Sharlto Copley) has a daughter that the now-adult and wingless Maleficent utters her legendary curse.The villains of fairy tales and comic books inhabit a Manichaean world of good and evil. Everyone from Lex Luthor to the original Maleficent (whose very name means doing evil) are wicked just because teaching our children and the adults they become that bad guys are everywhere and killing them is not merely permissible but natural. What is cheering about Jolies Maleficent is her journey; betrayed she descends to the depths of vengeful anger but she gradually recovers her ability to love. The star casting is successful because in the simple context of a fairy tale Jolie does make both the terrifying horned creature and her gradual awakening heartfelt suggesting emotional richness beneath the eye-stopping physical performance - rather like the way the celebrity herself hints at human weakness behind the Hollywood facade.Of course there are problems as Robert Stromberg a visual effects artist taking the directors chair for the first time bombards us with twittering fairies exploding trees and marching armies. Unrelentingly dark the violent humans are led by an increasingly haggard Copley playing a paranoid tyrant with an inexplicable Scottish accent. (The casts voices wander about the British Isles; only Jolies mid-Atlantic accent achieves the timeless hauteur suited to the piece.) For Stefan unlike his jilted Maleficent there will be no redemption - Copley actually creates a fairly realistic portrait of tyranny - and his troops assault the fairy kingdom loudly and repeatedly before ultimately capturing the creature whose audacity so torments them.Adults will probably experience the movie as the usual 3-D assault on the nerves; young children will surely find parts of this terrifying.On the lighter side the fairies who take care of young Aurora (a suitably vivacious Elle Fanning) until her 16th birthday are also grating. Its hard to see why anyone as suspicious of his supernatural neighbours as King Stefan would entrust his newborn to fairies let alone this bumbling trio performed by three British character actresses led by Imelda Staunton. Insufficiently explained by the script they are supposed to provide comic relief and a break from the darkness of both Maleficent and her human foes.But in truth you just cant wait until the wicked Jolie returns to the screen. Whether a malevolent twinkle illuminates her beady eye or a heartbreaking tear rolls down her alabaster cheek she is the films power. Only a few letters separate doing evil from doing great Her Maleficent is magnificent.

"Maleficent | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; maleficent ) Maleficent (United States 2014) May 29 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli Maleficent might best be described as an alternate universe re-imagination of Sleeping Beauty. Taking a page from Wicked (the stage show that presents Oz from the witches perspective) Linda Woolvertons screenplay presents an inverted version of the story where the ""villain"" is presented as the main character. The changes made to Sleeping Beauty work within this new context and in large part because of Angelina Jolies forceful and nuanced performance the title character escapes the one-dimensionality that trapped her in the 1959 Disney classic. Here shes a deeply tragic and conflicted figure who seeks solace and finds redemption in the most unlikely of ways. Director Robert Stromberg making his feature debut after assembling an impressive resume as a visual effects supervisor and production designer (he has worked with Scorsese Spielberg and Cameron and owns Oscars for Alice in Wonderland and Avatar) creates a rich and varied realm of magic and whimsy that becomes harsh and foreboding as darker powers emerge. Much of Maleficent has been crafted on computers but the animation is done with sufficient care that nothing looks awkward or artificial. Stombergs experience with special effects makes him an ideal choice for a movie that demands the creation of a fantastical world. Angelina Jolies acting provides sufficient emotional heft to balance off the eye candy. The 3-D is strong but by no means mandatory; the movie will work just as well in 2-D while offering a brighter image. Maleficent reveals how events transformed the title character from a happy optimistic young fairy into one of Disneys most recognizable villains. As a girl Maleficent (Isobelle Molloy) meets and befriends a young human named Stefan (Michael Higgins). The two share a close relationship for many years and as time passes it blossoms into a romance. Stefan however is seduced by ambition and becomes corrupted. He disappears from Maleficents forest kingdom called The Moors for a long period. When he returns (now played by District 9s Sharlto Copley) he pretends to want to reconnect with his lost love. In reality his goal is to drug her cut off her wings and use them to prove he has the mettle to be the next king of men. The deed done he returns to the city to await his coronation. Brokenhearted and bitter Maleficent (now Angelina Jolie) plots her revenge - something she enacts once King Stefan has a daughter. The sorceress pronounces a curse on young Aurora when the girl reaches her 16th birthday she will fall into sleep as deep as death. The only thing that will be able to awaken the princess is ""true loves kiss."" Maleficent offers two significant twists to the Sleeping Beauty yarn. The first is to make the sorceress actions explicable. Her deeds arent the product of malice and inherent evil; theres a reason for them. Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned and ""scorned"" is a weak descriptor for what Stefan does to Maleficent. The film also postulates a fairy godmother relationship between Maleficent and Aurora (played as a teenager by Elle Fanning). During the period when the princess is living in a wooded cottage with three fairies Maleficent visits her regularly and the two become close - so close that Maleficent regrets the curse and attempts to reverse it to no avail. Maleficent is a more mature iteration of the tale than Sleeping Beauty with the story having been framed as a fantasy adventure rather than a traditional fairy tale (much in the same way that Snow White and the Huntsman expanded on the simplistic premise of that animated classic). Screenwriter Linda Woolverton whose best-known credits include Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King understands the art of developing a script designed to find favor with both adults and their offspring. Although suitable for family viewing the target audience for Maleficent skews older with teenage girls and women in their early 20s in the crosshairs. Some scenes may be frightening for children and a battle during the third act which features a fire-breathing dragon is intense enough to push the boundaries of the normally tame PG rating. Calling Maleficent a ""modern-day classic"" as some have asserted is overreaching. The production is engaging and appealing but only the passage of time will determine whether it holds in the memory with the strength of its animated predecessor. As with many summer spectacles the chief draw is visual; the weird and wonderful world is a constant source of astonishment. To complete the cinematic equation Angelina Jolies interpretation of the title character which transforms the animated icon into a complex fully realized woman provides emotional depth and breadth. The marriage between the actress capabilities and the directors experience results in a satisfying and successful motion picture.

"Maleficent starring Angelina Jolie reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Maleficent A Fairy Tale About the Evil Spell Angelina Jolie Has Cast on America Maleficent A Fairy Tale About the Evil Spell Angelina Jolie Has Cast on America Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 29 2014 736 PM Maleficent A fairy tale about the evil spell Angelina Jolie has cast on America. By Dana Stevens Angelina Jolie is the title character in Maleficent. Photo by Frank Connor/Disney Enterprises Inc. After you watch Maleficent come back and listen to Dana Stevens and Vanity Fairs Katey Rich discuss the movie in our Spoiler Special. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. ""This curse will last until the end of time"" howls Angelina Jolie as Maleficent placing a fatal hex on the baby who will one day become Sleeping Beauty--and we take her at her word. Such is Jolies power to command authority--with or without the horned helmet digitally sharpened cheekbones and outsized fluorescent-green eyes--that no audience member doubts for a second that curse is staying put. Disneys Maleficent a mildly feminist revision of the ""Sleeping Beauty"" story understands this power of Jolies and exploits it beautifully. This is really a movie about the evil spell Jolie casts on us--its both a celebration and a demonstration of her formidable movie star might. Thats not to say that Jolie is the only thing to like about Maleficent. Theres also Elle Fanning as Aurora the guileless princess cursed to prick her finger on a spinning wheel at 16--a role that could easily have been cloying and might have been in less capable hands. But the 16-year-old Fanning has a childlike freshness and simplicity that make her joy at watching rainbow-colored sprites skimming over forest pools seem utterly plausible (not a negligible task given that the rainbow sprites were created in postproduction and she was probably watching a tennis ball on a stick). Maleficent doesnt skimp on the rainbow sprites mushroom-hatted trolls or clouds of fluttering blue butterflies which is another thing to appreciate about it despite its manifold hokinesses. In an era when fairy-tale adaptations are supposed to be Goth or steampunk or otherwise stylish and doomy this movie dares to delight in some of the same elements of fairy tales actual children delight in magic and witches and kings in ermine-trimmed red robes and ladies with conical veiled hats and yes goddammit fairies. I wished my 8-year-old was by my side--and that doesnt happen often in this age of bombastic overlong kids entertainments. Advertisement The queen of those fairies--and pretty much the undisputed ruler of everything in sight--is Maleficent who as we learn in the origin story that begins the film wasnt always maleficent with a small ""m"" (raising questions about her late parents naming practices--""Honey do you think its a problem that our childs name is synonymous with nefarious reprobate and wicked?"" ""Stop quibbling It sounds pretty""). Once upon a time she was an orphan fairy girl (Isobelle Molloy and Ella Purnell) who lived alone high in a tree and soared above the moors on spectacular (and gorgeously animated) wings. Her romantic friendship with a human boy she meets in the woods Stefan (Michael Higgins and Toby Regbo) promises to be the link that will broker peace between the human and fairy worlds. But when Stefan grows up (and becomes Sharlto Copley of District 9) he enters into an alliance with the evil king who seeks to destroy Maleficent. (Now that she has achieved Jolie-hood the nature fairy has become the ruler of her own kingdom by dint it would seem of sheer awesomeness.) Stefan who has his eye on the throne himself is tasked with the killing of his former childhood friend--but the worst he can bring himself to do is to put her to sleep with a potion and cut off her wings. Its to Jolies credit that she plays the scene in which she awakes to discover this atrocity naturalistically with raw screams of rage and disbelief. Its the fairy equivalent of waking up to find yourself suddenly paraplegic and the horror Maleficent expresses at the theft of her most used limbs makes her subsequent turn to evil understandable. The films second half--after Stefan ascends to the throne fathers the unlucky Aurora and sees her cursed by Maleficent at her christening--contains a few too many moments weve seen in other pop fairy-tale reworkings like Wicked Brave and Frozen which also show archetypal female villains (the witch the Snow Queen the controlling mother) as wronged complicated and vulnerable women. But just when the movies energy begins to flag--the subplot about King Stefan going slowly insane is particularly heavy-going and way overplayed by Copley--Elle Fanning arrives as the now-teenage Aurora and the growing connection between this happy laughing girl and the icily withdrawn Maleficent becomes the focus of the story. I wont give away how that relationship develops because its emotional arc was the element of the film that most surprised me. To the extent this is a feminist film--and remember I qualified that term above with ""mildly""--its one because it recognizes the complexity and the significance of the love between women. If anything you could complain that its the male characters especially the preening Stefan who are given short shrift. As in the 1959 Disney Sleeping Beauty there is a trio of sweet but squabbling good fairies who care for the baby Aurora here played by digitally shrunk-down versions of Imelda Staunton Lesley Manville and Juno Temple. Maleficent disposes of the services of an army of benevolent-but-fierce tree creatures that fall somewhere in between the Ents of The Lord of the Rings and the rock monsters of Noah as well as a raven-turned-man helper played by Sam Riley whos markedly less grating than your garden-variety sidekick and whose no-big-deal transformations from bird to man and back again make for a passably nifty special effect. Maleficent doesnt reinvent any wheels when it comes to the fairy-tale genre--but the fairy tale already comes with pretty hardy wheels and this sweet child-friendly adaptation creaks along on them quite nicely. The entire time I was watching it I wished my 8-year-old was by my side and that doesnt happen often in this age of bombastic overlong mayhem-laden kids entertainments. The film was directed by first-timer Robert Stromberg a production designer who has worked on some of the most bombastic and overlong among them including Alice in Wonderland and Oz the Great and Powerful. But here hes served by something those movies didnt have a screenplay (by Linda Woolverton who wrote Disneys Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King) with some grasp of the archetypal power of the story its reworking. Most of all though Maleficent has Angelina Jolie the only actress who could make zooming above the clouds on 5-foot wings seem like something she just casually fits in between serving as a U.N. goodwill ambassador and raising six children with Brad Pitt.

"Review Angelina Jolie wickedly good in not-quite-classic Maleficent - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Angelina Jolie is wickedly good in the not-quite-classic Maleficent Angelina Jolie Greg Williams / Disney Angelina Jolie stars in ""Maleficent."" Angelina Jolie stars in ""Maleficent."" (Greg Williams / Disney) Have you accidentally said magnificent instead of Maleficent? Well both apply to Angelina Jolie In re-imagining the infamous evil queen who curses an innocent girl ""Maleficent"" is very much a cautionary tale for modern times. It essentially begs the question -- are you sure it was the shrew that needed taming?It stars a wickedly good Angelina Jolie as the legendary Maleficent. In her hands the queen is endlessly fascinating and worlds away from the fairy tale staple that so many generations have been introduced to via Disneys animated ""Sleeping Beauty"" (1959). The new films position is clear and uncompromising on the question of who was in the wrong. Unlike ""Sleeping Beauty"" ""Maleficent"" explains all motivation regrets -- from the queens point of view. This multifaceted Maleficent has wit and empathy as well as rage. Jolie hasnt looked like shes had such fun with a role since 2005s ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"" though her ""Kung Fu Panda"" Tigress does have a bit of an ironic growl.The other players in Maleficents sphere and the bones of the ancient story will feel familiar based as it is on the animated movie and one of 17th century French writer Charles Perraults folk tales. But the spine of it has been changed by screenwriter Linda Woolverton. She joined the Disney fairy tale business with 1991s animated hit ""Beauty and the Beast"" after a lot of work in episodic TV. Veteran art director Robert Stromberg directs. Like most fairy tales there are good and evil metaphors for little ones and grown-ups alike. In that regard ""Maleficent"" is Disneys most adventurous female empowerment parable yet as it explores how the age-old power struggle between men and women shapes the identity of both parties. Though it never plays like a polemic the film has so much it wants to say the emotional power that might have made it a classic is undercut -- that is the other power struggle going on in the film. Photos Despite the bumps ""Maleficent"" is visually striking from its watercolor palette to its ethereal woodland creatures the ones that rise from the earth have the kind of fearsome look and power that might frighten little ones. Strombergs mastery of the craft earned him art direction Oscars for his work on ""Avatar"" (2009) and ""Alice in Wonderland"" (2010) and you can feel the imprint of that artistry in every frame. Photos From wicked stepmothers to jealous princes who yearn for their brothers throne animated Disney movies are known for their nefarious villains. Here are some contenders for the most villainous of all. Along with a crack creative team that includes cinematographer Dean Semler production designers Gary Freeman and Dylan Cole costume designer Anna B. Sheppard and senior effects supervisor Carey Villegas the filmmaker creates a world that sits on the edge of fantasy and reality. James Newton Howards score is a lovely accompaniment.Though the film starts earlier Maleficents primary beef is with Stefan (Sharlto Copley) who grows from a charming ordinary boy (Michael Higgins as the youngest Jackson Bews as the teen) into a weak man desirous of being king. Aurora is the infant Maleficent curses for her fathers crimes and as a youngster shes played by one of Jolies little ones Vivienne Jolie-Pitt followed by Eleanor Worthington-Cox. The luminous Elle Fanning steps in as Aurora at 16 pricking her finger on a spindle and falling in a death-like sleep while she awaits true loves kiss. Oh but so much happens before we get there.We first meet Maleficent in simpler times. She is a fairy too but one who looks like an ordinary girl (Ella Purnell) -- with wings. No one rules her side of the world. It isnt necessary. Her days are filled with magical creatures whose mischief is entertainment enough.The bad times begin with King Henry (Kenneth Cranham) a power-hungry land-grabbing monarch who first tries to conquer Maleficent and when that doesnt work demands her head. Stefan uses his boyhood friendship to get to her. Though he doesnt have the stomach for murder what he does provides the films most chilling scene.That Maleficents wings are clipped when she gets too powerful serves as a potent allegory for glass ceilings. The arc of Maleficent from innocent herself to evil queen is as much about survival as revenge. And the price exacted for getting to the top is a high one. It plays even more ironically in the wake of the recent firing of the New York Times first female editor Jill Abramson and the descriptions of her management style as well shrewish.Much of the film revolves around the relationship between Maleficent and Aurora as the girl grows up. A trio of tiny fairies -- Knotgrass (Imelda Staunton) Flittle (Lesley Manville) and Thistlewit (Juno Temple) -- who buzz around offering opinions and stirring up nonsense with their magic are somehow charged with raising the girl. They do a job of delivering many of the films lighter notes.This is Jolies film because of the Maleficent she makes. Everyone else even Aurora fades in her presence. When she is on the screen she is all you really see. In addition to an uncanny resemblance to the animated queen -- those legendary cheekbones enhanced to an even sharper edge those horns -- the actress creates a queen who may not be easy to love but she is hard to hate. The black-and-white stereotypes are replaced by far more subtle shadings the sneer that so characterized the original Disney queen is softened. And we havent even gotten to the curse-breaking power of true loves kiss. You will likely see this twist coming but its a nice one anyway.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com ------------MaleficentMPAA rating PG for sequences of fantasy action and violence including frightening imagesRunning time 1 hour 37 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Entertainment Column Reviews Animation (Movie Genre) Angelina Jolie Sleeping Beauty (movie) Maleficent trailer Angelina Jolie takes wing dragon makes debut Maleficent and why we love our childhood villains Brad Pitt deals with prankster; Maleficent cast talks villains Brad Pitts Maleficent prankster hit with restraining order Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-maleficent-review-20140530-column.html#navtype=outfit,200,maleficent14,maleficent,latimes

Comments click to enlarge Maleficent Video Rated PG  98 minutes  2014 Disneys live-action revisionist remake of its own Sleeping Beauty (1959) unfolds from the perspective of the villainess (Angelina Jolie) depicted here as a good fairy who turns bad only after being persecuted by humans. The original movies stark sense of good and evil is replaced here by a more nuanced relativist perspective which effectively prohibits the sort of nightmarish visions that made Walt Disneys early animation features so powerful. This looks impressive though making use of highly imaginative state-of-the-art 3-D effects while still evoking old-school Disney animation (even the wide-screen compositions seem to be modeled on those of the original). The supporting cast--which includes Elle Fanning Sharlto Copley Sam Riley and Imelda Staunton--is enjoyable too. Longtime special effects artist Robert Stromberg directed.

James Bridges/Twentieth Century Fox Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. By Ann Hornaday May 29 2014 Follow AnnHornaday One of the imperatives of stardom and one of the most difficult to navigate is the management of a screen persona over time somehow balancing ones artistic ambitions the audiences expectations and plain old-fashioned aging to create a career that gracefully spans characters stories and -- with any luck -- generations. Angelina Jolie delivers a savvy example of this in ""Maleficent"" a feminist-revisionist take on the Sleeping Beauty myth in which she inhabits the storys evil fairy a once-happy winged sprite who consumed with heartbreak and revenge places a curse on a baby princess. With her glinting eyes chilly hauteur and blade-like cheekbones (prosthetically enhanced for maximum cutting power) the increasingly iconic Jolie has finally transformed herself into living ice sculpture. The only remotely human thing about her is a pair of garnet lips that occasionally widen into a blindingly white rictus grin. If that sounds frightening it is. But its also kind of cool. And when Jolies Maleficent fixes her penetrating gaze on the victim of her curse a cherubic toddler named Aurora and says ""I dont like children"" the audience is in on the joke. This is Angelina Jolie humanitarian mother of six embodiment of her highly personal brand of cosmopolitan compassion. The trick filmgoers find out is how ""Maleficent"" will fuse that identity with the wicked title characters. Watching Jolie pose and smolder and glower is the chief attraction of ""Maleficent"" which posits that the reason for Maleficents rage wasnt being left out of a christening party for Aurora but instead started years earlier when she fell in love with the princesss father King Stefan. Propelled by passion power and betrayal this iteration of the fable -- written by Linda Woolverton and based on stories by Charles Perrault and the Brothers Grimm -- isnt a lot of fun. (""I wish she had smiled more"" one tween viewer was overheard saying after a recent screening.) Its dark and brooding and full of aggressive unsettling impulses. What comic relief there is comes in the form of Auroras three caretaking fairies played by the fabulous British actresses Lesley Manville Imelda Staunton and Juno Temple; Sam Riley is on hand as Maleficents factotum a crow named Diaval. But even the enlivening efforts of these fine players are small beer compared with Jolies imposing bellicosity as a horned embittered avenging angel. To viewers of a certain age watching Jolie coolly regarding her young victim will remind them of murder-minded Gene Tierney watching her own adolescent quarry in the noir thriller ""Leave Her to Heaven."" But when Aurora becomes a teenager -- at which point shes played by the ethereal Elle Fanning -- and that fateful encounter with a spinning wheel beckons ""Maleficent"" makes its most radical pivot allowing the complex relationship between the two women to eclipse outdated notions of consciousness-raising by way of a handsome prince. The drama handsomely staged and filmed by director Robert Stromberg is larded with now-requisite set pieces of wartime battles and slashing fights but its the psychological interplay between Maleficent and Aurora -- obsession antagonist and lost mirror image -- that throws off the most sparks. In all the film is a relatively subdued even dour affair. Theres no reason on earth for ""Maleficent"" to be seen in 3-D unless you count Jolies cheekbones as screen-busting special effects. On the heels of ""Frozen"" its difficult to see this far more somber tale inviting the same feel-good fealty among youngsters and their adult companions. Still for all its limitations ""Maleficent"" manages to be improbably entertaining to watch due solely to its title character. As befits a star of her regal standing and superb self-awareness Angelina Jolie has managed to bend even the Brothers Grimm to her indomitable will. Maleficent   1/2 In her first major acting role in years actress Angelina Jolie shows a different side of evil in the live-action Disney film ""Maleficent."" (Reuters) In area theaters.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Maleficent production-designer-turned-director Robert Strombergs somewhat feminist and slightly queer take on the Sleeping Beauty story is more well-intentioned than accomplished. The movie sets out to apply a revisionist twist to classic Disney material and to translate the aesthetics of matte painting to digital 3D environments. Its better at the latter than the former chock full of implausible landscapes which combine the perspective of paintings with the depth and texture of physical sets. As for the revisions...Maleficents script by Disney veteran Linda Woolverton (Beauty And The Beast The Lion King) recasts the evil fairy godmother from the studios 1959 version of Sleeping Beauty as an anti-heroine who was seduced drugged and physically violated (He cuts off her wings) by Sleeping Beautys father King Stefan (Sharlto Copley an eccentric casting decision in a movie full of them). The rape imagery is unsubtle punctuated by a scene where Maleficent (Angelina Jolie impressively committed to the role) wakes up face down in a forest. Finding cauterized stumps where her wings once were she breaks out in an intense chilling sob that briefly punctures the movies fairy-tale surface. Maleficent continually struggles to balance the requirements of cutesy princess fare with critical ideas. After Maleficent curses King Stefans daughter Aurora (played as a teenager by Elle Fanning) to fall into an eternal sleep on her 16th birthday the child is whisked away by three good fairy godmothers (Imelda Staunton Juno Temple and Lesley Manville). They prove to be ineffectual guardians and Aurora spends most of her childhood on the verge of starving to death or accidentally running off a cliff with only Maleficent--who doesnt want her revenge against King Stefan interrupted--to save her. This is where Maleficent starts to depart radically from its source material and where it introduces its best (and most squandered) ideas. Though its completely cancelled out by the movies tacked-on epilogue there are hints of an anarchist slant running through Maleficent--from an opening narration that contrasts the monarchy of the humans with the self-governance of the fairies to the riot shields carried by King Stefans guards in their final showdown with Maleficent. The feminist subtext occasionally bursts into the foreground in the films midsection where Maleficents relationship to Aurora begins to drift away from her hatred for the girls father. Though it manages to subvert the storys climax Maleficent never feels of-a-piece; its a collection of interesting directions run through a post-Renaissance Disney filter. It sets out to humanize one of the studios most iconic villains and in the process creates a new one-dimensional villain in the form of King Stefan. (His transformation from Maleficents childhood love into her metaphorical rapist might speak to the corrupting influence of power were it not so abrupt.) It presents the fairy world as a utopia of equals but then falls back on the faithful servant trope (embodied here by Maleficents pet raven played in human form by Controls Sam Riley) familiar from countless Disney animated films. And though its lavishly designed--a mixture of historical and stylized costumes unreal perspectives and Pre-Raphaelite meadows--its hardly imaginative preferring to act as a kind of visual tribute act. Despite the wall-to-wall effects work the only truly striking images in the film are shadowy close-ups of Maleficents face; they owe most of their effectiveness to Jolies performance. The result is a movie that doesnt quite work as a fantasy or as a subversion of the same.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint As a vengeful forest fairy sporting giant wings sinuous black horns and cheekbones sharp enough to slice any adversary to bits Angelina Jolie kills it as the title character in ""Maleficent."" The rest of this live-action spin on the classic fairy tale ""Sleeping Beauty"" doesnt match her presence and performance but it does bend some tired old formulas. The story begins promisingly with the young Maleficent as a wild child growing up on the moors in the more magical of two adjacent enemy kingdoms amid scary monster trees and gentle chortling fungi. She falls for a pinch-faced human boy named Stefan who commits a colossal act of betrayal and absconds to the other side. After Stefan (Sharlto Copley) becomes king and has a baby daughter named Aurora justifiably bitter Maleficent casts a curse dooming the girl to perpetual sleep once she turns 16. Events conspire to throw Princess Aurora (a beautifully bland Elle Fanning) and her witchy foe together. Not content to simply revel in the chance to play a cartoonish baddie Jolie takes her role seriously -- but not too much. In one of the films most touching scenes toddler Aurora (played by the stars own child Vivienne Jolie-Pitt) coos and cuddles up to Maleficent who sternly calls the child ""beastie"" but momentarily softens her expression. Shes a villain who cant be pigeonholed as all evil or incapable of change -- a great example for kids in our age of political polarization. Despite momentum at the outset visual lushness throughout a barrage of special effects and Jolies formidable appeal ""Maleficent"" fails to fully engage. Director Robert Stromberg is a visual-effects veteran both of action films (""The Hunger Games"" ""Pirates of the Caribbean At Worlds End"") and magical suspense (""Pans Labyrinth""). Here neither are on display as an overabundance of messy action scenes flatten the mood. The other characters are superficially drawn. A well-cast trio of pastel-hued guardian fairies named Knotgrass Flittle and Thistletwit (Imelda Staunton Lesley Manville Juno Temple) bring an inadequate measure of comic relief. Its refreshing to see a modern kid-targeted movie show restraint on the yuk-yuk jokes. But the action overkill could have been balanced with a bit more humor as when the young Maleficent says to a mushroom man in the woods ""Hi Mr. Chanterelle -- I like your cap"" and more character development. Disney Princess Aurora (Elle Fanning) is cursed by the vengeful Maleficent. From Stefan to Maleficents right-hand guy Diaval (Sam Riley) and a handsome young prince who fleetingly shows up to woo Aurora (Elle Fanning) the men are mostly peripheral players. In the end the ""true love"" Aurora finds is a sweet surprise for both her and the audience. Motivated by the box-office gold of female-driven kid flicks like ""Frozen"" Disney continues to stretch traditional boundaries. But like Sleeping Beauty lying in her coma ""Maleficent"" is mesmerizing to behold and hard to fully embrace.

What could possibly go wrong? Nearly everything in Maleficent a revisionist ""origins story"" of the sorceress in Disneys 1959 animated feature Sleeping Beauty. Except for Angelina Jolie exemplary as the fairy badmother who laid a narcotic curse on an infant princess this pricey live-action drama is a dismaying botch. Robert Stromberg the expert draftsman in his debut as director has no mastery of casting and guiding actors little sense of narrative pace or build and -- the big sad surprise -- a leaden sense of visualizing Maleficents fairyland. Full of spells and transformations the movie couldnt be less magical. Borrowing from the novel and Broadway musical Wicked which gave a redemptive backstory to The Wizard of Ozs Witch of the West scriptwriter Linda Woolverton argues that the young Maleficent (Isobelle Molloy as a child Ella Purnell as a teen) was a sweet grave girl -- an elfin aristocrat who in other circumstances might have grown up to be a wise queen like Galadriel in The Lord of the Rings. But instead of Aragorn she met the human Stefan (Michael Higgins as a boy Jackson Bews as a teen and Sharlto Copley as an adult). This dashing lad won Maleficents love and ambition overwhelming ardor clipped and stole her wings to become the king of a neighboring realm. Bastard To revenge herself on the man who unleashed her Wicked side Maleficent barges into the christening of King Stefans daughter Aurora and proclaims her famous curse that on the girls 16th birthday she will prick her finger on a sewing-wheel needle and fall into a coma breakable only by ""true loves kiss."" The King sends the infant into the Witness Protection program of three nattering fairies (Isabelle Staunton Lesley Manville and Juno Temple) whose cottage is monitored by Maleficents shape-shifting servant Diaval (Sam Riley). (SEE 13 Disney Princesses and the Actresses Who Voiced Them) At first Maleficent thinks the baby is ""so ugly you could almost feel sorry for it."" But over the years in the forest Aurora grows into a lovely teen (Elle Fanning) who calls Maleficent her fairy godmother. She just might steal -- as the woman who cursed her says -- ""what was left of my heart."" Cared for by three fairies who are at best dotty aunts a girl alone needs a mother figure and finds it in Maleficent. (Aurora at five is played by the stars daughter Vivienne Jolie-Pitt.) The warmth she can provide is chilled by the knowledge that she is the one who long ago doomed her one loving alliance. Producer Joe Roth -- who also shepherded the live-action versions of Alice in Wonderland and Oz the Great and Powerful through Disney and Snow White and the Huntsman at Universal -- rightly recognized Jolies kinship to Maleficent declaring that ""There was no point in making the movie if it wasnt her."" He was alluding to the stars dominant regal otherness. (READ Corliss on Angelina Jolie in Wanted) She almost might have been designed in some special-effects shop to play Maleficent. And Rick Bakers makeup artistry does her and the character proud with curling leathery horns and dark diagonal slashes on her cheekbones that sculpt her face into diamond-shaped severity. To the wolf eyes and Morticia Addams pallor Jolie brings an imperious vocal styling with echoes of Bette Davis. (Eleanor Audley voiced Maleficent in the animated feature.) She is the visual aural and behavioral embodiment of an otherworldly goddess capable of anything from poisonous curses to surrogate-mother love. (READ The sorry state of mothers in Disney animated features) Other than Jolies grandeur and a bit of Fannings freshness the movies got nothing. It takes its design cue from sword-and-sorcery films in their sepulchral early-80s phase (The Dark Crystal Legend) but fails at its evocation of enveloping murk. When it tries for lightness of image with the appearances of fairyland sprites the creatures are wan unbeguiling and poorly integrated into the surrounding flora. Lightness of touch is also missing; Maleficent didnt have to go the parody route of The Princess Bride (which also had a full measure of enchantment) but a little knowing levity would have given the characters life outside of their stereotypes. Roth and Disney knew their project had problems; they enlisted John Lee Hancock director of The Blind Side and Saving Mr. Banks to rework the early scenes and add a ton of narration (voiced by Janet McTeer). Apparently no one could fix the clumsy comedy of the fairy trio or the minimal impact on Aurora of two royal deaths and least of all the unfortunate casting of Copley. The South African actor so comically poignant as the lead in Neil Blomkamps District 9 (his first feature role) lacks the traditional skills needed for a fairy-tale hero turned villain. Nor did anyone attend to anomalies in Maleficents powers. She can change Diaval into any creature from crow to dragon except when toward the end she cant. Her imposing wings get sawed off until they get magically and capriciously reattached. (READ Corlisss review of Neil Blomkamps District 9) The Disney people ought to know how to tell this story -- of a female with frightening powers finally battling to save the princess who suffers from her curse -- because they just did it. Anyone remember Frozen? That animated wonder had the forces of good and evil at war in the same character plus a love story smart laughs and a hit song that ran through everyones internal iPod for months. (READ Why Frozen Was Totally Thaw-some) Maleficent ends with Lana Del Ray singing the original films ""Once Upon a Dream"" (based on Tchaikovskys Sleeping Beauty waltz) in a droning tone that suits this production. Its a requiem a dirge for a lifeless movie. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Special to Newsday + - Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) and Young Aurora (her daughter Vivienne Jolie-Pitt) in Disneys ""Maleficent"" directed by Robert Stromberg. Photo Credit Disney / Frank Connor advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT ""Sleeping Beauty"" told from the villainess side. Rated PG. BOTTOM LINE Angelina Jolie is magical. The rest -- not so much. CAST Angelina Jolie Elle Fanning Sharlto Copley LENGTH 137 A ""Wicked"" for tweens this live-action reimagining of Disneys animated ""Sleeping Beauty"" told from the villains point of view flips the elegant Maleficent from evil to tragically heroic. One might think thats a waste of a good villain or a denial of the existence of evil -- does it matter if the Joker or Osama bin Laden were traumatized as kids? -- but it works if the villain has been genuinely misunderstood. Dont try this at home with Hannibal Lecter. So once upon a time the sorcerous fairy Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) uninvited to the christening of the kings daughter Aurora casts a curse sending the girl to a death-like sleep at 16 to be awakened only by true loves kiss. Classic overreaction. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? But not really That wasnt pique but payback for emotional reasons this retelling makes visceral. The films best moments in fact are those powered by emotion not plot as Maleficent finds to her surprise she cant help but protect the girl growing up in an isolated cottage. When the teenage Aurora (Elle Fanning) makes Maleficents formal acquaintance having always sensed her ""fairy godmother"" the love between them is palpable and moving. Yet for all such emotional resonance and as Shakespearean as Copley makes King Stefans ambitions ""Maleficent"" misses the mark. Auroras three ""auntie"" fairies (Lesley Manville Imelda Staunton Juno Temple) are third-rate Three Stooges. An ""impenetrable"" fence of living thorns seems to come and go whenever the plot requires characters to do so. And one climactic moment involving true loves kiss swipes directly from Disneys own ""Frozen"" (2013) -- the logical extension being which the movie clearly didnt mean to suggest that Aurora is simply settling for Prince Philip (a befuddled Brenton Thwaites out of place in a throwaway role). Nor is the look particularly magical. Though first-time director Robert Stromberg is an Oscar-winning production designer the landscapes are video-gamey the trolls and gremlins look like 1980s animatronics and the digital matting at times recalls the 1950s Superman TV series. 155 MoviesMaleficent review Curse this film.

Here are four other films with spellbinding screen sorceresses. advertisement | advertise on newsday THE WIZARD OF OZ (1939) -- It wasnt easy being green for Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch of the West. During one scene when her costume caught fire the flames reached her copper-based makeup leaving her with first-degree burns on the right side of her face. I MARRIED A WITCH (1942) -- ""Peek-a-boo Blonde"" Veronica Lake had her best screen role as a mischievous witch who falls for politician Fredric March after a love-potion spell goes awry. Reportedly there was no love lost between the two stars. BELL BOOK AND CANDLE (1958) -- Kim Novak and James Stewart reunited after the success of ""Vertigo"" for this bewitching comedy. It also was the last romantic lead for Stewart who was 50 and becoming self-conscious about the age difference between him and his leading ladies such as the 24-year-old Novak. THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK (1987) -- Three stunning witches (Cher Michelle Pfeiffer and Susan Sarandon) use their magical powers to raise Cain in their Rhode Island town getting plenty of help from a devilish stranger (Jack Nicholson).

(Photo/Video Magnolia Pictures) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Updated May 29 2014 640 p.m. ET 3 COMMENTS Lukas Moodyssons ""We Are the Best"" captures the screw-loose joy of youth with consummate ease and grace. The time is 1982 and the place is Stockholm where three middle-school girls are determined to start a punk band even though they know punk is over and two of the three have no instruments or discernible musical skills. (The existence of chords and harmony comes as news to them.) Dont be put off by the punk or by what might strike you as a depleted era of pop history. The true--and universal--concerns of this blissfully funny film are living life pushing limits making a mark discovering love. And dont expect a standard coming-of-age story since the outcome is mercifully free of intimations of maturity. Its a being-of-age story in Swedish with English subtitles the age being early adolescence when kids with throbbing hearts and incompletely wired brains are full of passion and blithe illogic. Mr. Moodysson who was once deemed a ""young master"" by Ingmar Bergman has had his ups and downs in a career that began provocatively with ""Show Me Love"" in 1998 My favorite ups are ""Together"" (2000) and ""Lilya 4-Ever"" (2002). Now at the age of 45 hes neither young nor old but hes certainly masterly with a touch so delicate as to be undetectable. Instead of performances theres a magical sense of life caught on the fly. (In fact the filmmaker adapted the script from a comic book by his wife Coco Moodysson. The cinematographer was Ulf Brantas and the editor was Michal Leszczylowski.) The premusical members of the punk trio--atonal cant convey the gleeful racket they manage to make--are Bobo (Mira Barkhammar) and her buddy Klara (Mira Grosin). They are both of them 13 years old and so thoroughly lovable that every glimpse of their funny faces brings new delight. Bobo is the tender tomboy quiet and seemingly earnest behind her round steel-rimmed glasses. Klara is the impish one sporting hair that shes spiked with soap; neither her pretty face nor her whirligig mind are ever in repose. Ignorant of music the friends may be but theyre smart enough to persuade an actual musician to join them. Hedvig (Liv LeMoyne) is 14 an eighth-grader and genuinely more mature than Bobo and Klara though that in itself isnt saying much. Serious sweetly humorless--or at least irony-deficient--and friendless until the advent of the alliance Hedvig has two big things going for her in Bobos and Klaras eyes. She plays the guitar having taken lessons for four years and shes a practicing Christian which means that the other two can try to liberate her from what they see as her repression and win her over to their vaporous notions of agnosticism. (Their first initiative in the latter campaign consists of singing her a hideous ditty of their devising called ""Hang God."") Half a century ago when Bergman was in his prime the arrival of a new film by the Swedish master or by other masters in other countries was a significant event for a significant number of American film lovers. Times have changed of course. Foreign films as a cultural movement have lost much of their luster in the era of the multiplex and of marketing bombardments whose budgets routinely run to many tens of millions of dollars. On a week when two heavily marketed studio productions will open on thousands of screens this little Swedish comedy will be hard for filmgoers to find. But Mr. Moodyssons film is little only in physical and financial scale. When measured by the pleasure it confers ""We Are the Best"" is a big deal that will be winning hearts--and even grownup minds--for a long time to come. Watch a clip from the film ""A Million Ways to Die in the West."" Starring Seth MacFarlane Charlize Theron Liam Neeson Amanda Seyfried and Neil Patrick Harris. (Photo/Video Universal) A Million Ways to Die in the West Mel Brooks can relax. (If he can relax.) Seth MacFarlanes comedy western is no ""Blazing Saddles."" Some of it sputters settling for smiles instead of laughs and much of it flounders while the slapdash script searches at exhausting length for ever more common denominators in toilet humor. Handsomely photographed (by Michael Barrett) and enhanced by an irony-free score (by Joel McNeely) ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" starts with a clever idea or at least with a promising character--a cowardly sheep farmer Albert (played by Mr. MacFarlane) who lives in frontier Arizona in the late 19th century and loathes everything about it except Amanda Seyfrieds Louise a local beauty who rebuffs his love because she loathes his cowardice. But the production is seldom as funny as it promises to be though it does turn downright likable when a mysterious beauty named Anna (Charlize Theron) is on screen and the script--by Mr. MacFarlane Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild--isnt trying to be funny at all. ENLARGE Charlize Theron and Seth Macfarlane in A Million Ways to Die in the West Universal Pictures Thats because Ms. Therons dry droll style provides a fine foil for Mr. MacFarlanes blandness as an actor. Albert who remains stuck on Louise warms with painful slowness to the possibility that Anna might consider him attractive. But Anna finds the situation amusing and Ms. Theron whos as skilled in the ways of comedy as she is beautiful makes Annas amusement alluring even endearing. Mostly though Alberts blandness stands him in not-so-good stead as a quasi-action hero in a pseudo-saga that sends up a variety of western tropes--gunfights saloon brawls chases on horseback across red-rock landscapes--with little wit and no bite. The cast includes Liam Neeson as a swaggering villain and Neil Patrick Harris as the mustache-twirling proprietor of a shop that sells mustache wax. A couple of surprise cameos are funny enough to get by without making a scintilla of sense. Watch a clip from the film ""Maleficent."" Starring Angelina Jolie Elle Fanning and Sharlto Copley. (Photo/Video Disney) Maleficent Under the banner of not leaving well enough alone--remember ""Oz the Great and Powerful""?--Disneys ""Maleficent"" tells the hitherto untold and long unawaited back story of ""Sleeping Beauty"" from the point of view of the evil witch. In this version Maleficent who is played as an adult by Angelina Jolie in full-bore hauteur isnt evil as a child. Far from it she is sweet-spirited and pure of heart until a betrayal turns her heart to stone. That raises the question of why her parents didnt pick a nicer name for her--Beneficent might have been a good choice--but lots of other questions are raised by a live-action movie that comes to life only when the screen is flooded by digital effects of variable quality. Sometimes theyre gorgeous as in several flying sequences; sometimes theyre murky or violent and banal as in several battle sequences; and sometimes theyre cute but a little creepy as in escapades of the three pixies--now named Flittle Knotgrass and Thistletwit--who reminded me of Fred Astaire Nanette Fabray and Jack Buchanan dancing on their knees as babies in the ""Triplets"" number of ""The Band Wagon."" The answer to one central question--why the reliance on technology at the expense of simple humanity--lies in the background of the director Robert Stromberg. He has never directed a movie until now but hes a reigning wizard of digital effects which is clearly what Disney wanted. (Just as the runaway success of the Broadway musical ""Wicked"" is what the studio wanted to emulate in single-witch mode.) Ms. Jolie is in truth a formidable presence--with heightened cheekbones that sweep up into her ears like the speed lines on a sports car and green vapors rising from her shoulders. Still this icon of witchcraft cant save a production thats suffocatingly elaborate yet insufficiently bewitching. Watch a clip from the film ""Night Moves."" Starring Jesse Eisenberg Dakota Fanning Peter Sarsgaard and Alia Shawkat. (Photo/Video Cinedigm) Night Moves Kelly Reichardts meditation on the contradictions of the environmental movement focuses on three eco-terrorists--they consider themselves radical environmentalists--as they prepare to blow up a hydroelectric dam with a boat bomb then follows them as they absorb the consequences of what theyve done. Although the film generates some suspense in the process its main concern is morality and a decay that besets the self-styled idealists. Paradoxically though the action phase slow-paced as it is proves to be more interesting than its moral consequences which unfold with glum predictability and lead to an oddly opaque conclusion. Jesse Eisenberg Dakota Fanning and Peter Sarsgaard play the conspirators. Mr. Eisenbergs Josh is anxious from the start a man given to long reflective walks in the woods. (The Oregon locales are spectacularly beautiful.) Ms. Fannings Dena comes from a wealthy Eastern family and bankrolls the purchase of the secondhand speedboat that gives the movie its name. Mr. Sarsgaards Harmon has a technical confidence born of military experience and a prison record that he mentions only in passing. Any one of the three could be the ventures weak link. ENLARGE Jesse Eisenberg in Night Moves Cinedigm Ms. Reichardt who wrote the script with Jonathan Raymond has made several films of calm distinction mysteriously minimalist dramas that require close attention and offer no easy explanations in return. Thats the style she has deployed here but the story is a shallow-draft bark with flat characters on board Josh in particular is de-energized to the point of entropy. ""Night Moves"" suffers from a lack of mystery and a deficit of motion. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download ENLARGE Together (2000) Lucas Moodyssons terrific political comedy which starts in 1975 centers on a Stockholm commune thats riven by arguments great and small--over sex Marxist-Leninist doctrine the materialist aspects of ""Pippi Longstocking"" and the introduction by truly radical elements of hot dogs and a small black-and-white television. Some members leave and some stay but the group reconstitutes itself on the basis of real feelings rather than political posturings. The idea of togetherness can be a good thing ""Together"" says; a better thing is people drawn together by love in all its unlikely forms. ENLARGE Young Adult (2011) Charlize Theron is Mavis Gary a self-deluded author of young-adult novels. Mavis was once prom-queen beautiful. Now in her late 30s she can still pull herself together to fairly dazzling effect. But she is also sly selfish nasty hurt and hurtful dryly sardonic and fatefully deluded. What makes her such a marvelous character is what seethes deep beneath her skin. What makes me continue to wonder about this movie which Jason Reitman directed from a script by Diablo Cody is why most people I know are baffled by my fondness for it. ENLARGE Published Credit no credit no credit Meeks Cutoff (2010) Kelly Reichardts marvelous minimalist epic amounts to a master class in the power of observation. Much of the action is seen and barely heard in long shots. The pace matches that of the characters three families in a wagon train moving slowly toward Oregon in 1845. At least the families hope theyre headed for Oregon since their guide a mountain man named Stephen Meek has taken them on an unmarked path and theyve lost their way. Meek is played with layered extravagance by Bruce Greenwood but you watch everyone and everything with unswerving attention.

Its fine to tell old tales anew and its fine to mold them to some new purpose -- say a narrative of maternal repentance. But its not fine to do it so artlessly. Perhaps the definitive example comes at the films midpoint when Maleficent after cursing the infant Aurora in dramatic fashion visits her at home and says ""I hate you."" Youll swear its being played for laughs but if thats the case then whither the drama? Wither indeed. There are holes throughout -- in character in plot in action - nearly all of them stuffed full of overworked lumpen CGI. Poor Elle Fanning -- every girl wants to be a princess but anyone would get tired from all that rapturous smiling. Sleepy even. 2014. -- Matthew Lickona This movie is not currently in theaters.

"Angelina Jolie a magnificent Maleficent review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesAngelina Jolie a magnificent Maleficent reviewUnfortunately the rest of the movie a revisionist fantasy about the evil fairy who cursed Sleeping Beauty falls short with a dark and lumbering tale.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. May 29 2014MaleficentStarring Angelina Jolie Sam Riley Elle Fanning Sharlto Copley Lesley Manville Imelda Staunton and Juno Temple. Directed by Robert Stromberg. 97 minutes. Opens Friday at major theatres. PGWhat a curious beastie is Maleficent Disneys revisionist account of the evil fairy who dooms a princess to eternal slumber in the 1959 animationSleeping Beauty.""Curious beastie"" is how Maleficent refers with fascination and puzzlement to the child Aurora whom she cursed at her Christening as she grows into a teenager while coming closer to the finger-prick destiny of the well-known fairy tale.Article Continued BelowBut it also applies to this dark strangely lumbering tale -- in tone and often-frustratingly dim lighting made even worse by 3D glasses -- which swings from initial whimsy to despair and regret without managing that magical Disney-style enchantment.Angelina Jolie stars with her real-life daughter Vivienne Jolie-Pitt portraying young Aurora in Maleficent.  (Frank Connor / Disney)  Angelina Jolie is the black-clad horned baddie of the title in Maleficent. And shes the best thing about the movie.  (Frank Connor / Disney)  Its also punctuated with fierce clashes with terrifying mythic creatures that could be too intense for many young viewers. With its opening line ""Let us tell an old story anew"" Maleficent echoes The Wizard of Oz companion tale Wicked a chance for a ""bad"" character to explain her side of things. Certainly Maleficent whose very name invokes menace was the most interesting full-blooded character among Sleeping Beautys pastel cast making her ideal fodder for a revisit. But before she was labeled evil (or maybe she was just drawn that way) young Maleficent (Isobelle Molloy) was an outgoing sweet-tempered orphan fairy seemingly the only one of her horned kind soaring on massive wings over her beloved moors and all the fanciful creatures living there.Things change with the arrival of Stefan a human Maleficents own age from a nearby kingdom where avarice and ambition is the norm. In this fairy tale boys and even princes arent the ones who come to the rescue even if there is a white charger involved. They form a friendship that deepens into something more.When Angelina Jolie finally bursts onscreen midflight as the mighty and mature Maleficent there is nobody else. Even if the stilted CGI trickery sometimes fails her winged Maleficent is magnificent bellowing warnings to those who threaten her moors.With cheekbones so sharp they could plane lumber and vermilion lips standing out against vaguely fetish-wear costumes everything pales next to those great curling horns that arc from her skull. She delights in her power. Occasionally shes even amusing a complex character with a well-explored past. If only the rest of the movie lived up to her.A battle with an army from the kingdom across the moors heightens Maleficients resolve to keep the humans at bay. But her trust in one of them ends in betrayal stripping her of her massive wings leaving her wounded and hardened. She vows revenge walling up her land with thorns and her heart with bitterness.Stefan (District 9s Sharlto Copley) now grown becomes king and has a child. Maleficent crashes her Christening and you know the rest. Only true loves kiss can break the sleeping curse she invokes over the babys cradle and Maleficent has every good reason to view that as the greatest fairy tale of all.For at least part of Maleficient screenwriter Linda Woolverton (Alice in Wonderland The Lion King) appears anxious to leave all that ""someday my prince will come"" jazz in the dust while staying visually true to the animated Sleeping Beauty in ways that will make those familiar with the original smile with recognition.As in the original Maleficent is teamed with a raven. Diaval (Sam Riley Control) is far more personable than the foul squawker of old and he has shape-shifting powers that often see him take on human form.The familiar three fairies who bestow gifts on the baby Aurora in her cradle (here played by Lesley Manville Imelda Staunton and Juno Temple in a vaguely creepy bit of CGI trickery) get expanded roles as comic relief caring for the young Aurora in a secret forest cottage away from the palace and all contact with spinning wheels in hopes of avoiding her curse. Look for the next generation of screen stars in the toddler Aurora played by Jolie and Brad Pitts daughter Vivienne Jolie-Pitt. She was the only youngster who was able to be on set with Maleficent without panicking at the great horned presence.Elle Fanning (Ginger and Rosa Super 8) plays the teenage Aurora who takes her fairy-bestowed blessing to ""always be happy"" a bit too far perpetually grinning with enthusiasm at every opportunity. A trusting sort she forms an unexpected bond with Maleficent nonplussed by her arching black horns and strange gimlet eyes seeing instead her fairy godmother. In truth Aurora isnt far off the mark. Maleficent feels growing affection for her ""beastie"" and regrets actions taken in anger.First-time director Robert Stromberg who comes from the production design side of filmmaking where he picked up Oscars for Avatar and Alice in Wonderland is more about visuals than storytelling and that lack of cohesion costs Maleficent where it counts.Read more about Angelina JolieThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Photo Disney MOVIE REVIEW Maleficent Running time 98 minutes. Rated PG (violence disturbing images). At the Empire 34th Street others. Well theres still no female superhero movie but at least we have Angelina Jolie as a pissed-off fairy-tale avenging angel. Its the role she was born to play If only there was a decent movie for her to play it in. This muddled reboot of ""Sleeping Beauty"" despite a bit of sisterhood-is-powerful lip service falls down on the job joining the ranks of those two ""Snow White"" updates in the ""Really? This is the best you could do with all that money and a timeless childrens story?"" genre. Directed in a feature debut by visual effects artist Robert Stromberg its often arresting to look at but never has a strong sense of where it wants to go. Sharlto Copley (second from left) as King Stefan in ""Maleficent.""Photo Disney Jolies horned Maleficent born a fairy in a magical glowy swamp kingdom at odds with its ""Game of Thrones""-esque neighbors is no villain. Her character only takes on her scowl (and cowl) after being repeatedly assaulted by humans particularly one (Sharlto Copley) whom she thinks shes in love with. After drugging and mutilating her (so disturbingly I might add that Id hesitate to bring any non-grown-up to this movie) he goes on to become king of the other kingdom and thus her vengeful wicked queen is born. It all feels more ""I Spit on Your Grave"" than Brothers Grimm. Watching Jolie attain full malevolence is delicious. When she storms into the castle with magical fingertips blazing shes as formidable as the best screen villains; when she gets quietly angry its even better. Other characters seem to crumble around her like so much CGI dust. Wait . . . maybe that was CGI dust. Its hard to tell because so little of the movie outside of Jolie feels non-computer-generated. As per the original she lays a curse on the kings baby daughter. Aurora will grow up pretty -- still non-negotiable even in 2014 -- and prick her finger on a spinning wheel at 16 falling into a deep sleep forever (otherwise known as a coma?). Unless that is she is redeemed by true loves kiss a caveat Maleficent only tacks on out of sheer cynicism. But then as if taken hostage by her own fairy biological clock Maleficent becomes obsessed with stalking and eventually befriending the youth shes cursed. Jolies least believable line -- to her own daughter Vivienne playing the toddler Aurora -- is ""Go away. I dont like children."" As for Jolies other company on-screen Sam Riley (""On the Road"") fares best as Maleficents shape-shifting familiar putting an appealingly Goth spin on the business of being half-crow. Elle Fanning as Princess Aurora in ""Maleficent.""Photo Disney Imelda Staunton Juno Temple and Lesley Manville are mired in bad giggly slapstick as a trio of good fairies and Elle Fanning as the grown princess isnt asked to do anything but appear beatific and befriend various CGI swamp creatures many of which seem like they drifted over from the ""Avatar"" cutting room floor (and might have as Stromberg was the production designer on that film). And as the handsome prince Brenton Thwaites looks like a lost member of One Direction. No this is not the movie Jolies character deserves. And yet Ill admit it made me a little teary to see the actress winged and soaring like some Greek god one year after that very public disclosure of her cancer surgeries. For all the CGI noise around Jolie her central performance here is still a gloriously cinematic happily-ever-after.

"Maleficent review - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Review Maleficent  1/2Angelina Jolie puts some heart into Sleeping Beautys bad bad girlMay 29 2014|Michael PhillipsAngelina Jolie stars in Disneys ""Maleficent."" (Disney Enterprises MCT)The formula works. It worked with ""Wicked"" on stage and it worked with ""Frozen"" on film -- tilting the storytelling prism so that a new angle on a well-known fairy tale appears in the light. The strategy depends on humanizing characters formerly known as evil so that another tale of conflicted impulses emerges from the story we know driven by female antagonist/protagonist hybrids who arent bad just misunderstood.So it goes with ""Maleficent"" the Disney corporations bombastic moderately entertaining explanation of why the ""queen of all evil"" from its 1959 animated ""Sleeping Beauty"" got that way and why she wasnt really.This is almost entirely Angelina Jolies show. ""Maleficent"" is her first picture in four years and from the tip of her characters prosthetic cheekbones to the needle-sharp tippy-top of one of the massive horns (like party favors that got out of control) approximately 14 inches north of her skull truly this is a performance that goes from point A to point B without seeming rote or ho-hum.Screenwriter Linda Woolverton sets up a dueling-kingdoms narrative humans uneasily located adjacent to the land of sprites fairies wicker men and a color palette bright enough to make you urp. As a young girl Maleficent has wonderful wings and an exuberant spirit. One day in the forest she meets an interloper Stefan shy and charming.Years later now a career-minded young adult Stefan (played by the perpetually strenuous Sharlto Copley of ""District 9"") is required to kill Maleficent to prove himself worthy of running the kingdom. He cant go through with the deed but he drugs his ex-sometime-girlfriend and robs her of her most conspicuous adornments. What else can Maleficent do at this point? She lets it go -- cant hold it back any more -- and exacts revenge on her one-time squeeze by casting a spell on his newborn daughter the princess Aurora. Much of the action and some of the dialogue overlaps and intersects with the 59 animated film itself drawn from the Perrault and Grimm versions of ""Sleeping Beauty.""""Maleficent"" is all about second thoughts. Our anti-heroine who dominates the proceedings like a drag act looking for her spotlight spends much of the film as Auroras conflicted fairy godmother her heart warming reluctantly to the girl under the spell. (Maleficents child-care trio is played by motion-capture versions of Imelda Staunton Lesley Manville and Juno Temple; Sam Riley is her shape-shifting sidekick.) There are elaborate battle sequences with Maleficent wiping out hordes of human soldiers that recall the dark-toned blood-free slaughter of another recent fairy tale do-over ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" (which I liked actually).Elle Fanning plays the older Aurora and while she and Jolie are required to stay within the boundaries of a specific type of green-screen acting theyre awfully good at it; their work is vivid and emotionally potent even when the first-time feature director Robert Stromberg an Oscar-winning art director doesnt bring much in terms of fluid camerawork to the party. As Maleficent herself thaws into pretty-niceness Jolie keeps a tight rein on the transformation and on the film as a whole. There are moments when you wish the spell-caster would banish James Newton Howards sloshy pushy musical score to the neighboring kingdom of Generica. On the other hand makeup wizard Rick Baker deserves plaudits (or kudos whichever is ranked higher) for the title characters angular serrated look.And now Disney can move on to developing the untold story of Cruella de Vil and how she was wronged by a caddish London playboy with an affection for dogs.mjphillipstribune.com""Maleficent"" - 2 1/2 starsMPAA rating PG (for sequences of fantasy action and violence including frightening images)Running time 137Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Life Skill 201 Washing a baseball capLongtime nursing home operators must face trial judge rules10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesMaleficent Angelina Jolie Gets Evil in New Disney SpotJanuary 20 2014WATCH Angelina Jolie Elle Fanning Talk Maleficent in...April 17 2014Watch Maleficent Video Incorporates Disney NostalgiaMay 7 2014Disney dates Angelina Jolie starrer Maleficent Fantasy...April 9 2012Angelina Jolie takes the vile out of villain in MaleficentMay 27 2014Find More Stories AboutMaleficentTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-maleficent-review-20140530,0,5658116.column",200,maleficent26,maleficent,chicagotribune

Bill Goodykoontz USA TODAY NETWORK 1127 a.m. MST May 29 2014Angelina Jolie as the evil queen ""Maleficent.""(Photo Walt Disney Studios)Story HighlightsCritics review 2.5 starsAngelina Jolie is powerful as the villain from Sleeping Beauty.The story both explains how Maleficent went bad and changes the classic tale.The changes would be fine if they made for a better story but they dont.So everything you know is wrong.That seems to be the message in ""Maleficent"" Robert Strombergs film which amounts to a towering performance in search of a story worthy of it. This is not so much the story of Disneys 1959 ""Sleeping Beauty"" told from the point of view of the wicked fairy who curses the princess as it is an overhaul of the plot an explanation of how Maleficent went bad.NEW June movie guideNothing wrong with that in theory -- if it improves upon the original. This does not.On the other hand Angelina Jolie out-and-out commands the screen whenever shes on it with her portrayal of the title character. You simply cant look away and its not just the effects and make-up.But Jolies performance so overshadows the rest of the cast (and the rest of the movie) that you sometimes feel as if the other characters are like us just standing around watching her. This is not however the fault of the other actors. Its the fault of screenwriter Linda Woolverton who doesnt give them much to do thats challenging or interesting.The world of the film is divided into two parts the land of the humans and the moors which are home to fairies and other mystical creatures. The two worlds are at odds which makes the friendship between Maleficent (Isobelle Molloy) a fairy and Stefan (Michal Higgins) a human all the more unusual. Stefan is caught trying to steal a jewel from the moors but he and Maleficent hit it off.2014 Summer movie guideThey continue to see each other and develop an innocent romance. But time marches on and Stefans ambition grows. Eventually he will betray Maleficent in a literally painful way an act that will lead him to become king.The adult Stefan (Sharlto Copley) marries and has a daughter named Aurora. Shunned from the christening Maleficent (Jolie at this point) shows up uninvited and gives Aurora an unwelcome gift by way of a curse She will grow up beautiful but on her 16th birthday she will prick her finger on a spinning wheel needle and sleep as if dead.Stefan begs for mercy and Maleficent acquiesces slightly. True loves kiss is the only thing that can awaken Aurora. Betrayed before Maleficent is confident true love is something that doesnt exist.Raised in the woods by fairies (Lesley Manville Imelda Staunton and Juno Temple) who prove woefully inadequate for the job Aurora (Elle Fanning) does indeed grow to be beautiful. And Maleficent despite her anger becomes a kind of wayward fairy godmother to her.The two become close and Maleficent will grow to regret the curse but things have already been set in motion. There is a Prince Phillip (Brenton Thwaites) hanging around but hes more a clunky plot device than a character. Though when the curse finally manifests itself as it must (though Aurora doesnt sleep for long) Stromberg does figure out a nice little twist on the usual fairy-tale trope.Jolie beneath make-up and effects is best when shes bad particularly when Maleficent stalks the young Aurora. And the film looks great (Stromberg has won two Oscars for art direction). The moors in particular have a rich textured look.But the last act once the fairy-tale business is taken care of descends into one long fight scene making the film play like yet another superhero reboot instead of a reimagining of a classic story.So Maleficent isnt really evil. Or was and then wasnt. Or was made to be. In the end its kind of hard to tell and despite Jolies performance even harder to really care.Review Maleficent 2.5 starsDirector Robert Stromberg.Cast Angelina Jolie Elle Fanning Sharlto Copley.Rating PG for sequences of fantasy action and violence including frightening images.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

Shes a terrific vision decked out in leather-wrapped horns that feel more comics convention than forest-dwelling evil fairy. But if you go into Maleficent expecting Jolie to be the badass of Sleeping Beauty youre going to get burned. This new version is about her softer side. Here shes a wounded heroine who looks out for Aurora (Elle Fanning) even though she has cursed the princess to eternal sleep. Such revisions feel slightly out of place At one point Jolie cuts loose with an actorly scream at the loss of her wings and its as if she were auditioning for a different movie. Still a lot of thought has gone into the gauzy feel of this universe (the film is directed for good and ill by Robert Stromberg an Oscar-winning production designer). Twisting thorny woods magical sunbeams fluffy stuff floating in the air--its pretty much the fantasy Ridley Scott wanted to make with his 1985 stinker Legend. Youll wince at the indignity of brilliant Brits like Imelda Staunton and Lesley Manville reduced to playing squeaky-voiced sidekicks and when that famous dragon from Sleeping Beauty finally does appear it somehow has less fire than the hand-painted one from 55 years ago. But for tweenage princess obsessives this is a perfectly acceptable next step after Frozen with a voluptuous Lana Del Rey outro song to boot.

(Disney) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday May 29 2014 400 AM Title Maleficent Film Info ""Sleeping Beauty"" from the villains POV. Director Robert Stromberg (134). PG Mild fairy-tale frights. Area theaters. In 3-D where available. Angelina Jolie is so wickedly enchanting in the magical magnificent ""Maleficent"" you may not notice how transporting this female-driven blockbuster really is. In reimagining ""Sleeping Beauty"" -- Disneys great-looking but not-quite-beloved 1959 animated fairy tale -- this new movie flips the script not only on the storys heroes and villains but on the kind of emotion to expect in a summer blockbuster. A handsome prince? Yes hes here along with a ferocious fire-breathing dragon and seriously imposing castles. But the real magic is something truly unexpected. Elle Fanning is the cursed Princess Aurora in Malaficent. (Disney) When we first see Maleficent shes a child herself the budding queen of the fairies. She cares for the many strange creatures in her realm but is fascinated by the humans in a neighboring land. One day she saves a boy a prince named Stefan and they share what the teenager calls ""true loves kiss."" It isnt He soon leaves his supernatural sweetie to returns to life among his kind. Angelina Jolie with her daughter Vivienne Jolie-Pitt as the young Aurora in Maleficent (Frank Connor/Disney) Years later the king of the human territory promises his throne to whomever slays the fairy queen as a prelude to war. Stefan finds the grown Maleficent who welcomes him unaware that as she sleeps he will slice off her incredible wings and lie that hes killed her. Seeking revenge the seething Maleficent finds Stefan -- now the king -- and curses his newborn daughter Upon her 16th birthday she will prick her finger on a spindle and fall asleep. The only thing that can awaken her is ... true loves kiss. The movie then catches up with the 59 version. The king assigns three flying pixies (Imelda Staunton Juno Temple Lesley Manville) to act as shape-changing nannies to raise the girl Aurora (an iridescent Elle Fanning) in a remote cottage away from any danger (and spindles). But its not long before the girl unaware of the curse and Maleficent make contact. Thats where the script from Linda Woolverton (""Beauty and the Beast"" ""Alice in Wonderland"") truly takes off. As she watches Aurora grow a cauldron of motherly concern fear and love bubbles up inside her. When the film arrives at its perfect 180-degree twist from the original story we see it coming but the pure power of the moment is nonetheless unstoppable. With the exception of the three argumentative pixies -- diminished in importance here but still irritating -- the fantastical world around ""Maleficent"" enchants. British actor Sam Riley makes a perfect minion as Diaval a raven Maleficent saves before she turns him into a human to aid in her protection of Aurora. He has a similar widows peak as Jolie and theyre a great match. A quest for revenge drives the plot in Maleficent. (Disney) Jolie in her exquisite ink-black horns nails every note perfectly. Shes playing here with her split pop-culture identity Earth mother and temptress altruist and agitator. ""Maleficent"" proves that no performer is more adept at controlling her image. When Jolie sneers or cocks an eyebrow she knows exactly the spell shes casting. jneumaiernydailynews.com Catch ""Joe Neumaiers Movie Minute"" throughout the day Thurs. - Sun. on New Yorks WOR 710 AM and at wor710.com.

All Rights Reserved. (Frank Connor/DISNEY) Print Email Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on May 28 2014 at 1128 PM updated May 29 2014 at 909 AM comments ""Persistence of vision"" -- its that trick of the eye that holds on to an image for a fraction of a second after it disappears that bit of ocular magic that makes the movies even possible. But its also what makes any movie good. Is the filmmakers vision of the material apparent from the first frame to the last? Is the piece artistically coherent? Emotionally constant? Does it create its own world and live by its own logic? ""Maleficent"" doesnt. Its painfully obvious too because a fairy tale -- particularly a revolutionary one like this -- desperately needs consistency. Well believe anything given a chance but dont keep changing the rules. Yet the story twists its characters tortuously and loses sight of its audience early on. A revisionist feminist version of ""Sleeping Beauty"" ""Maleficent"" begins with the title figure -- the evil enchantress of the old story -- as a young winged fairy living in the woods and ruling as her lands gentle orphaned queen. You wonder just why a gentle queen would have been named Maleficent at birth -- doesnt bode well does it? -- but she is a peaceful sprite. Until an evil young lover drugs her cuts off her wings and uses that violent act to grab the throne of a neighboring kingdom. So Maleficent swears revenge -- a revenge shell exact by placing a curse on his young daughter. This is fine at first (the script is by Linda Woolverton long a go-to Disney writer) but the direction by Robert Stromberg is an immediate mess. A long-time special-effects whiz making his filmmaking debut he crowds every scene with gimmickry; the opening CGI landscapes are so overdone they look like bad cartoons. And the tone is equally muddled. There are some absurd frog-like creatures and a trio of dizzy slapstick pixies all of which seem to be here for the toddlers. Yet theres also a firebreathing dragon a ferocious wolf and enough murderous swordsmen to fill a Hobbit movie. Really parents of little ones be cautioned -- this is a PG-13 movie at heart given a big-studio pass by the MPAA. Of course putting a grim spin on childrens favorites has become a mini-trend lately. And theres a certain empowering agenda at work here as the script turns somersaults to make the king into the villain Maleficent into the heroine and the prince (and his famous kiss) almost pointless. Which is fine I suppose and fits with some of Disneys other recent girl-oriented films like ""Frozen"" (even if for marketings sake the magic kingdoms still besotted with pretty princesses). But the script loses credibility as it twists about to first motivate Maleficents evil then have her change her mind. And it plays unfairly with its own myths refusing to have Maleficent use her magic whenever it might get in the way of the plots contrivances. Angelina Jolie looks wonderful of course as Maleficent even with the odd slashing cheekbones theyve given her. And the sly Sam Riley is charming as Diaval her shapeshifting right-hand man. (Or crow depending on her mood.) But Sharlto Copley is even worse than usual as the hissable King Stefan a ruler who subsists on a diet of fresh bile and processed ham. And as Sleeping Beauty herself -- well Elle Fanning is as natural and charming as a plastic daisy. There are a few nice moments and Jolie is terrific whenever the film lets her be bad instead of trying to make us understand her (as if we wanted to). She has a terrific pair of horns some glorious wings and a nice army of walking trees. Its a movie full of things to see. Theres just no vision. Ratings note The film contains violence. Maleficent (PG) Disney (97 min.) Directed by Robert Stromberg. With Angelina Jolie Elle Fanning Sharlto Copley.

"Maleficent (PG) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Maleficent (PG) Angelina Jolie is the best special effect of all in this re-imagining of ""Sleeping Beauty"". Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com5/28/2014 Editor rating 3 There are two sides to every story and there can be countless versions of the same tale. Maleficent the enchanting live-action reworking of the 1959 animated Disney classic Sleeping Beauty has all the touchstones you remember The spinning wheel the poisoned needle the three fairy godmothers the charming prince and a fearsome dragon that can stand alongside Peter Jacksons Smaug without shame. The main difference this time is that the fable is told from the point of the view of the eponymous villain (Angelina Jolie) an evil fairy who curses the infant daughter of the king (Sharlto Copley) condemning her to die on her 16th birthday. Sporting giant wings black horns on her head and eyes that constantly change color and sparkle with malice Jolie resists the natural temptation to push the character into camp. Instead she plays the role straight-up with subtlety and feeling wielding her natural beauty as a weapon. Even the augmented cheekbones that are part of her makeup cant mar her looks and first-time director Robert Stromberg who won two Oscars for art direction (Avatar and Alice in Wonderland) goes in for close-ups of his star as often as he can. In a movie crammed with special effects -- wait until you see the giant tree monsters -- Jolie is the most startling and wondrous of all. Stromberg and screenwriter Linda Woolverton resist the temptation to darken the source material first written by Frances Charles Perrault in 1697 and mutated into various incarnations over the centuries. Unlike Snow White and the Huntsman or Red Riding Hood which upped the violence and danger in order to secure a PG-13 rating and lure older teenagers Maleficent is unabashedly aimed at kids. Aside from some cartoonish overly cutesy forest creatures the movie looks fantastic shot in an inviting striking palette by cinematographer Dean Semler (Apocalypto). Instead of falling into the CGI-overload trap that snared Sam Raimi in Oz the Great and Powerful or overloading the movie with superfluous subplots like Tim Burton did with Alice in Wonderland Stromberg keeps the movie moving at a brisk pace (97 minutes) with no needless musical numbers or unnecessary characters. The result is a rare live-action Disney movie that merits comparison to its beloved feature-length cartoons. Maleficent doles out some surprises in its second half becoming its own film while still being worthy of the title Sleeping Beauty. For fun try showing your children the original cartoon before taking them to see this new and inventive retelling and watch their young minds reel (for maximum effect spring for the IMAX 3D version which looks stunning). Maleficent is the summers first real surprise -- a project that looked like a cash grab built on a well-known brand name as well as a vanity project for Jolie. But the movie turns out to be sweet and funny and exciting and touching. It also makes a convincing argument that sometimes being bad feels pretty good.

Probably a bird because Maleficent doesnt fly anymore. (Frank Connor) B- Maleficent Genre Action/Adventure Drama; Starring Sharlto Copley Elle Fanning Angelina Jolie; Director Robert Stromberg; Release Date Wide 05/30/2014; Runtime (in minutes) 135; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor Walt Disney Pictures Posted June 12 2014 -- 1200 AM EDT ""Let us tell an old story anew and see how well you know it."" The first line of Maleficent could be emblazoned on a sticker and slapped onto the back-bumper of Hollywood an industry that has at this point become more interested in recycling than Ed Begley Jr. The classic movies characters and franchises of the past are dead dinosaurs that have since turned into precious commodifiable oil and no one is sitting on top of a richer reservoir than Disney. The latest to come galloping out of the vault is Maleficent which casts Angelina Jolie -- somehow made more angular and aloof -- as one of the studios great animated villains the horned epitome of evil from 1959s Sleeping Beauty. As with other perspective-switch narratives like Grendel or Wide Sargasso Sea (or even Wicked) the film exists to fill in the cracks of the original story giving context to a characters antagonism. Betrayed by her childhood love (Sharlto Copley) so that he could become king Maleficent curses the princess Aurora (Elle Fanning) She will prick her finger on a spinning wheel by her 16th birthday and fall into a death-like sleep. The hex is one made by a woman scorned and according to this revisionist fairy tale soon regretted as the cuddlier version of the villainess becomes a reluctant fairy godmother to Aurora. Robert Stromberg the production designer responsible for the horizon-less CGI dreamscapes of Alice in Wonderland Oz The Great and Powerful and Avatar makes his directorial debut and -- surprise -- theres a lot of levitating cliffs and odd flora. But despite their bleeding-edge digital design the backgrounds have all the depth of the old matte-painted backgrounds of the analog days. That might not be an accident since a lot of Maleficent feels classical in nature. The characters are boiled down to their essentials the humor is timelessly broad and Jolies at her best when shes curling her claws and elongating her vowels like a black-sabbath Tallulah Bankhead. Unfortunately the story is more than a bit of a muddle a string of sequences that shuttle the characters back and forth between the films sole two locations a castle and a magic forest. And somehow theres only enough time for Sleeping Beauty to get five minutes of shut-eye before shes almost immediately awoken by true loves kiss. Thats not a death-like sleep thats a power nap.

He romances her for several decades until he betrays her for the chance to become king. The bad news comes as a shock.Film Details Maleficent RatingPG GenreAction/Adventure Running Time97 min.

So she does what any wounded woman would do Curse his baby daughter to an inescapable coma.Like Oz the Great and Powerful Maleficent considers itself a revisionist fairy tale that spins a demonized witch into a feminist icon. Hardly. Both movies hinge on a man as though the sheer power of being rejected by one dude is enough to make any girl nuts. Maleficent and the Wicked Witch of the West can terrify armies but they cede their emotional strength to a mortal twerp. Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm At least in Wicked the topsy-turvy retelling that started the trend the witch turned evil because of her politics. As did Mystique in X-Men Days of Future Past who would respond with a sneer if invited on a manicures-and-ice cream girl-power date with Maleficent.Still Jolie carries her embittered witch with the dignity of Nefertiti. She rarely speaks preferring to sulk and scream. Stromberg and his effects team have enhanced the actresss otherworldly beauty to monstrous perfection The cheekbones jut out like cliffs the green eyes glow the full mouth stretches over an impossible number of teeth. For a childrens movie Maleficent makes one hell of a Vogue pictorial eschewing the breakneck pacing expected of a PG Disney flick for the stern art-house rhythms of Jean Cocteaus 1946 Beauty and the Beast.Yet Maleficent suffers from the same problem that has sandbagged Jolies career Her directors shoot her like a goddess but set her in a world that treats her like an urchin. Jolies films never hurdle that key contradiction -- the filmmakers joy at photographing such beauty versus her need to prove that shes more than a pretty face. As a result Jolie picks scripts where her characters are rejected or victimized (A Mighty Heart Salt Beyond Borders) only to wind up looking so gobsmackingly gorgeous that the plot no longer makes sense.Clint Eastwoods Changeling was the most preposterous offender a period piece about a stunning single mom who begs a dozen men to help find her son and has every door slammed in her face. Stromberg has the sense to recognize that onscreen Jolie is no mortal but then she still gets dumped by the dweeb from District 9.Its not impossible to reconcile Jolies too-pretty paradox. Here the plot could be rescued with just an eyebrow a glimmer of regret on Copleys face that he has to give up this magical creature for a kingdom. Id prefer to see her sink her teeth into the sexy goofy terrifying roles that made her famous the fully alive Girl Interrupted who embraced her powers instead of apologetically tamping them down. Instead Jolies taking her serious-minded talents to the directors chair. Which if youve seen her stilted Bosnian war drama In the Land of Blood and Honey isnt a fair trade.For now Maleficent is Jolies last scheduled on-camera performance and despite its eye-rolling silliness it certainly sends her out like a star. Its less kind to the promising Elle Fanning whose Princess Aurora is a grinning passive fool. Were meant to love her for her innocence -- even Maleficent slowly comes around -- but with the grown woman hogging the show Aurora never resonates as anything more than a lunatic toddler.In inverting the classic tale like a sock the maternal red blue and green pixies (Imelda Staunton Lesley Manville Juno Temple) have been recast as negligent babysitters who worst of all prove immune to the films Girl Code of Honor by staying friendly with their friends evil ex. (And when they pressure a cute stranger to kiss their comatose 15-year-old they almost come across as criminals.)With more actual grrrl power Maleficent would be a bold redo. Instead its a beautiful snooze a story that hints at the darkness underneath our fairy tales and tarnishes the idea of true love without quite daring to say whats really on its mind that even the best of us might not live happily ever after.MALEFICENT | Directed by Robert Stromberg | Written by Linda Woolverton | Walt Disney Studios | Citywide1 Angelina JoliePHOTO BY FRANK CONNOR Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 755 p.m. EDT May 29 2014Angelina Jolie as Maleficent in a scene from the Disney motion picture ""Maleficent.""(Photo Frank Connor Disney)Maleficent the story of a sinister fairy with vengeance issues opens with visual panache.But it fails to live up to its early promise mostly because of an uneven tone and murky character development ( out of four; rated PG; opens Thursday in select theaters and Friday nationwide).Billed as the untold story of the malevolent character from the 1959 animated Disney movie Sleeping Beauty its cobbled-together plot meanders more than a stroll through an enchanted forest presumably the result of a few too many rewrites.Adults know that characters can have a multiplicity of impulses. Generally kids get it too (witness the popularity of Frozen and the conflicted queen Elsa). But at a screening a child voiced her confusion to a parent ""Is Maleficent good or bad?"" Its a valid query. In a PG-rated movie kids should be given a clearer sense of motivation.The scenery is vividly rendered with tree creatures reminiscent of The Lord of the Rings and winged characters resembling those in Pans Labyrinth. But Maleficent doesnt come close to the escapist magic of either film.Familiar to Disney audiences Maleficent is a horned witch-like figure who in her original form was draped in black and purple and had a greenish face. Her haughty demeanor spoke volumes -- none of them good.Angelina Jolie powerfully conveys her characters menace. Though with red glossed lips and sculpted cheekbones -- minus the putrid-green complexion -- shes a more glamorous incarnation.Here Maleficents sympathetic side feels tacked-on. No doubt the filmmakers figured fans of Beauty and the Beast and Wicked would be enthralled by a conflicted character. But Maleficents back story and psyche are more vague and less developed than those of the Beast or Wickeds Elphaba.We briefly see her living contentedly as a girl in her peaceful forest kingdom happily zipping about on an impressive set of black feathered wings.When she is robbed of those wings her sense of betrayal is understandable. But her revenge on an innocent baby upon whom she casts an irrevocable curse is less comprehensible.That infant is Princess Aurora daughter of King Stefan (Sharlto Copley). As a peasant boy he had befriended Maleficent and the pair fell in love. But then out of a lust for power he tricked her. As she slept Stefan cut off the wings that enabled her to swoop about the forest. Soon shes bent on vengeance and Stefan goes back to the palace with a feathery trophy and is made king.Apparently even an enchanted fairyland hath no fury like a woman scorned. Couldnt the writers have come up with something more creative than a retro tale of a woman wronged?Jolie is at her best in vicious mode. When she appears at Auroras christening and curses her she is mesmerizing in her ability to strike terror. But too much of her time is spent skulking about glowering and pouting.Per Maleficents orders Aurora will fall into a coma on her 16th birthday. Only loves kiss can save her.The king and barely-glimpsed queen send Aurora to live in a cottage with a trio of well-meaning but inept fairy babysitters. .Elle Fanning as Aurora in a scene from the Disney motion picture ""??Maleficent."" (Photo Jonathan Prime Disney)Aurora (Elle Fanning) grows up sweetly open-hearted. She is drawn to the forest -- and is inexplicably allowed to roam unsupervised by her daffy caretakers. She seeks out the company of Maleficent who rebuffs her in mildly comic fashion. Of course Aurora has no idea about the curse since she doesnt know shes the princess.Anyone over 7 can figure out where the story is going and how Maleficents better nature will be rekindled by the endearing Aurora.Jolie pulls off the thinly written part by adopting a commanding presence. When the role calls for her to bellow the curse her character vividly comes alive.Disney missed a golden opportunity to tell a bewitching story and instead gives audiences a muddled revisionist tale with stunning visuals.r 241 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 20 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/05/28/maleficent-review/8324797/",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/05/28/maleficent-review/8324797/,200,maleficent36,maleficent,usatoday

""Let us tell an old story anew and we will see how well you know it."" So goes a voice-over at the beginning of Maleficent Robert Strombergs visually stunning if narratively predictable debut feature. The story of course is Sleeping Beauty or if you prefer the fairy tale on which the 1959 animated Disney classic is based. Maleficent  (2/4 stars) Written by John Lee Hancock and Linda Woolverton Directed by Robert Stromberg Starring Angelina Jolie Sharlto Copley and Elle Fanning Running time 97 min. Written by Disney veteran Linda Woolverton (The Lion King Beauty and the Beast) Maleficent is a sly update of the childrens fable in which a princess is cursed at birth to prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and fall into eternal sleep--only to be awakened by loves first kiss. The character that gives the film its title is the one who does the cursing and she is given the backstory the films creators seem to think she deserves--and the sex appeal. Maleficent is played with icy grace by Angelina Jolie whose feline eyes and jagged cheekbones go well with her costume of wings and twisted black horns. Maleficent we are shown isnt all that bad; shes aggrieved. The bad guy in this scenario is King Stefan portrayed on screen by the South African actor Sharlto Copley who played a convincing villain last summer in Neill Blomkamps sci-fi dystopia Elysium but here feels underdeveloped and a bit too manic for his own good. Stefan doesnt start out evil nor is Maleficent born vindictive. They first meet as orphaned children. Hes human; shes a fairy living in the moors an enchanted land populated by all manner of wonderful creatures. They fall in love but drift apart as Stefan blinded by ambition works his way up the regal ladder. Maleficent in turn becomes the moors protector as her domicile is besieged by the kings territorial advancement. To win the kings approval and claim the throne Stefan drugs Maleficent and cuts off her wings with an iron chain--iron being apparently a fairys only weakness. In so doing he invites upon himself and his family the worst of enemies. And so that old story is told anew. Somewhat in the mold of John Gardners novel Grendel which came out of the Beowulf story it makes the antagonist the protagonist by empathizing with her. The question is Why tell the Sleeping Beauty story anew? With this half-hearted film Mr. Stromberg the visual effects wizard behind such big-budget blockbusters as Oz the Great and Powerful Alice in Wonderland and Avatar cant provide an answer. Perhaps more importantly why is she called Maleficent? It seems unlikely that well find out. In the meantime we await similarly nonsensical films devoted to the evil queen in Snow White Cruella de Vil and the hunter in Bambi.

TWITTER Angelina Jolie and Elle Fanning topline Disneys reimagining of ""Sleeping Beauty."" No stranger to larger-than-life characters Angelina Jolie doesnt chew the estimable scenery in Maleficent -- she infuses it wielding a magnetic and effortless power as the magnificently malevolent fairy who places a curse on a newborn princess. Her iconic face subtly altered with prosthetics shes the heart and soul (Maleficent has both it turns out) of Disneys revisionist live-action look at its most popular cartoon villain the self-described Mistress of All Evil from 1959s Sleeping Beauty. A few bumpy patches notwithstanding the new feature is an exquisitely designed emotionally absorbing work of dark enchantment. With the productions star wattage well-known source material and multipronged branding push the studio should see its 175 million gamble on a first-time director stir up box-office magic both domestically and in international markets. As the Broadway musical Wicked did for the Wicked Witch of the West the movie humanizes Maleficent by creating an origin story revealing a shocking betrayal that turned the kind fairy vengeful. Reworking an age-old tale that has undergone countless variations over the centuries the screenplay by Linda Woolverton (Beauty and the Beast) draws from Charles Perraults 1697 ""La Belle au bois dormant"" and the animated Disney feature that gave the spiteful character a name and a deliciously sinister personality -- which Jolie deepens while still finding the kick in it. Theres no hundred-year sleep in the new films timeline and the handsome prince is a bit player in a story whose true center is a love that has nothing to do with happily-ever-after romance. PHOTOS 35 of 2014s Most Anticipated Movies X-Men Days of Future Past Maleficent But magical fairy-tale elements still abound in the debut helming effort of Robert Stromberg production designer on Avatar and a longtime visual effects artist whose credits include Pans Labyrinth The Hunger Games and Life of Pi. ""Let us tell an old story anew"" the films voiceover narration begins setting a tone of once-upon-a-time with a twist. (The opening scenes were written by an uncredited John Lee Hancock for late-in-production reshoots.) Though the narration sometimes states whats already obvious Janet McTeer delivers it with mellifluous and warm authority. Those early scenes show the blossoming love between two orphans a compassionate fairy girl named Maleficent and a human boy Stefan. Played as kids by Isobelle Molloy and Michael Higgins and as teens by Ella Purnell and Jackson Bews they grow apart as adults. Jolies Maleficent is busy as protector of the moors and Stefan is driven by ruthless ambition to attain his kingdoms crown. Hes played by Sharlto Copley as the epitome of cravenness -- a far cry from the just noble and dreamy kings of many a childhood story including the source for this one. To secure that crown Stefan commits an act of unspeakable cruelty against Maleficent. The mutilation takes place offscreen but its effects are fully felt; Maleficents heartrending reaction recalls Jolies cry of anguish as Mariane Pearl in A Mighty Heart. To call Maleficent a woman scorned would be the mildest of understatements. And so her cruelty is understandable if not justifiable when in a scene of beautifully orchestrated suspense and terror she attends the christening of King Stefans child Aurora and casts her under a spell dooming her to begin a very long nap at age 16 after the famously foreordained incident with a spinning-wheel needle. The teenage Aurora appearing three-quarters of an hour into the movie is played by Elle Fanning with a preternatural brightness. (Jolies daughter Vivienne Jolie-Pitt takes her screen bow as the 5-year-old princess.) The opposition between the innocent openhearted girl and the hate-filled fairy queen has the necessary archetypal pull and their initial meeting in the night forest is one of the most striking sequences in the Disney canon. STORY From Maleficent to Hercules Summers 5 Biggest Box-Office Risks Theres a diamond-in-the-rough aspect to Auroras loveliness; shes no conventional Disney Princess but a child of nature with a strong sense of justice and an innate toughness -- qualities that link her to the young Maleficent. Assuming that Maleficent is her fairy godmother and not her nemesis she befriends her and gradually Maleficent grows protective of her unwitting victim and conflicted beneath her poise. As in Brave theres a deeply felt maternal bond informing the action but in this case its one defined not by blood but by affinity and respect. A prince (Brenton Thwaites) shows up -- on a white horse no less -- but hes hardly a key element of the drama. The separate worlds of lovers-turned-enemies Maleficent and Stefan are divided by a wall of thorns and vividly imagined defined in ways that bridge the stylized (inspired by the animated feature and vintage illustrations) and the richly textured organic. Stromberg and producer Joe Roth have enlisted a team of ace collaborators and for the most part the film seamlessly combines the work of the actors with the costume design by Anna B. Sheppard the production design of Gary Freeman and Dylan Cole and the Carey Villegas-supervised visual effects. The enchanted moors combine a misty painterly quality with a make-believe sparkle although the resident mud creatures with their Darth Vader voices are as distracting as the rock monsters in Noah. On the human side there are quintessential storybook settings august castles and expansive fields of war. The 3D though unnecessary lends a subtle depth to the visuals. The most extraordinary visual effect though is Jolies transformation into the title character. With the help of prosthetic appliances contact lenses and a team led by creature-design whiz Rick Baker Maleficent has iridescent eyes and cheekbones like knives. Jolie gives her a regal bearing and an ultra-composed way of speaking. In battle scenes that are integral to the story but whose scale and clamor feel like concessions to contemporary action-movie norms Maleficent is right in the fray a Valkyrie facing down invaders. Tempering her rage and intensity is the raven Diaval (Sam Riley equipped with beaklike schnoz) Maleficents shape-shifting sidekick of sorts. Their back-and-forth has a comedic edge. Providing broader comic relief and whimsy are three tiny pixies played by Imelda Staunton Juno Temple and Lesley Manville through a combo of performance capture and CGI. Entrusted by the king with caring for Aurora before her fateful 16th birthday they snap out of their pixel-based bodies into human size but remain hopelessly pixilated -- clownishly inept at childcare. The comedy is never overstated whereas the swell and bombast of James Newton Howards score comes on strong in the early sequences before finding a groove. For most of the movie Stromberg strikes the right balance between intimacy and spectacle and Dean Semlers fluent camerawork reveals the invented world with a sophisticated take on the primal play of darkness and light.

(AP Photo/Disney Frank Connor)The Associated Press+Read Caption This photo released by Disney shows Angelina Jolie in a scene from ""Maleficent."" (AP Photo/Disney Frank Connor) Share PhotoMaybe its too soon to say the tide has shifted definitively. But its certainly been a unique time for fairy-tale villains.After hundreds of years of moral clarity suddenly were getting a new look at these evil creatures who are actually turning out to be complex beings and not that bad at all. Really theyve just been misunderstood. (And by the way those charming princes? Highly overrated.)The most obvious recent example is ""Frozen"" the animated Disney blockbuster that showed us how the Snow Queen long portrayed as an icy-hearted villain was actually a tragic victim of circumstance with a pure and loving heart. And now we have ""Maleficent"" which tells us that one of the most evil characters in all of pop culture is equally vulnerable and misunderstood.Plus shes gorgeous. Duh. Shes Angelina Jolie.All this is a rather seismic development in fairytale-dom. There are numerous versions of ""Sleeping Beauty"" stemming back even before Charles Perraults from 1697 but the fairy who casts an angry spell on the baby princess dooming her to prick her finger has always been well just nasty.But now 55 years after Disney introduced the character named Maleficent in its 1959 classic film-- and colored her skin an eerie green -- the studio is back with a live-action (not to mention 3D) Maleficent whos more superheroine than evil fairy. Think Maleficent by way of Lara Croft.And though Maleficent is no longer green-skinned its hard not to think of another green-skinned villainess whos also been rehabilitated by means of the durable Broadway hit ""Wicked"" the witch Elphaba from ""The Wizard of Oz"" who it turns out we just didnt know enough about.And so it is in ""Maleficent"" in which director Robert Stromberg and screenwriter Linda Woolverton take us back to the fairys youth to better understand her. Shes a plucky young thing with lovely wings and bright pink lipstick which will turn blood-red when she becomes an adult (the fairy world clearly isnt lacking for cosmetics.)One day she meets a young man from that other darker world where humans live. The two form a strong bond. But the ugliest human emotions -- jealousy and ambition -- will intervene. Young Stefan will grow into the power-hungry older Stefan (the wild-eyed South African actor Sharlto Copley.) And his stunning betrayal of Maleficent will instantly harden her turning her into the villainess we recognize.Alas the storys still all about a guy in the end. But we digress.""Maleficent"" is surely targeted to the same audience -- young and female -- which has so lovingly embraced ""Frozen"" and its appealing message of female solidarity and empowerment. But ""Frozen"" felt clever charming and fresh. ""Maleficent"" less so.Part of this is due paradoxically to Jolies star wattage. Dont get us wrong shes the best thing about the movie and always worth watching. But it blunts the effectiveness of the narrative if we can never quite believe Maleficent is bad. Thats because we know shes essentially good and she seems to know that we know it; You can see it in the upturned wrinkle of her mouth.And frankly the other characters are simply not that interesting -- Stefan but also Elle Fannings Aurora or ""Sleeping Beauty."" The best scenes Aurora has in fact are when shes a gurgling baby and then adorably a toddler played by none other than 5-year-old Vivienne Jolie-Pitt. (In the movies one laugh-out-loud moment Maleficent tells Aurora ""I dont like children."")But Fanning as Aurora is too boringly sweet -- especially compared to the fabulous-in-every-way Maleficent with her blazing lips fashionable black headgear and exaggerated cheekbones not to mention her way around a quip.In the end ""Maleficent"" is fun for its appealing visuals -- especially in the forest -- and for watching Jolie. But thats not enough to make the whole film interesting. As the minutes tick by you might even start feeling a bit like Sleeping Beauty herself comes to feel Drowsy.""Maleficent"" a Walt Disney Studios release is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association of America ""for sequences of fantasy action and violence including frightening images."" Running time 97 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.MPAA rating definition for PG Parental guidance suggested.

Now almost midway through the year 2014 seems unlikely to produce many more visually arresting brilliantly designed stoned-college-kid-friendly pieces of eye candy than Disneys ""Maleficent."" As for its revisionist take on the travails of the iconic ""Sleeping Beauty"" villainess however it falls far short of something an imaginative fan-fiction scribe let alone obvious role models John Gardner or Gregory Maguire might have crafted from the material. Uncertain of tone and bearing visible scarring from what one imagines were multiple rewrites the film fails to probe the psychology of its subject or set up a satisfying alternate history but it sure is nice to look at for 97 minutes. Boasting an impressive and impeccably costumed Angelina Jolie in the title role it ought to prove a solid global moneymaker and merchandise-minter for the Mouse House. Of the four fractured fairy tales produced by Joe Roth (""Oz the Great and Powerful"" ""Alice in Wonderland"" ""Snow White and the Huntsman"") ""Maleficent"" is the one that hews closest to its source material and its not always clear whether this helps or hinders. Directed by first-time helmer Robert Stromberg from a script credited to ""Beauty and the Beast"" scribe Linda Woolverton the film has a clever enough big-picture take on the ""Sleeping Beauty"" tale yet it sputters and snags as it tries construct a coherent emotional arc and its reference points from the 1959 animated original feel more dutiful than inspired. Opening with storybook-themed voiceover narration ""Maleficent"" sketches a realm of two rival kingdoms - not Stefans and Huberts but rather the world of humans and the outlying moors which are home to fairies trolls and imposing wickermen. Darting around the moors like a sort of saucer-eyed Tinkerbell is the winged young fairy Maleficent (Isobelle Molloy) who strikes up an unlikely friendship and later romance with a trespassing human farmhand named Stefan (Michael Higgins). Alas their love is not to be as a poorly explained war breaks out between the two kingdoms years later and the adult Stefan (Sharlto Copley) betrays Maleficent (Jolie) by drugging her and cutting off her wings all in the name of a job promotion. (To be fair going from farmboy to king is one hell of a jump up the employment ladder.) Now a woman scorned and shorn Maleficent fashions a magical staff from a twig dons a black helmet and takes memorable revenge on Stefans infant daughter Aurora. Granted the proper grace notes and breathing room this sequence of events could have provided more than enough material for a dark stand-alone prequel - indeed it took George Lucas three full features to complete a very similar character arc for Anakin Skywalker. However ""Maleficent"" is only just now getting started and the next two-thirds of the film see our erstwhile antihero hiding in the bushes outside Auroras cabin in the woods serving as an unlikely ""fairy godmother"" and rethinking her curse while Auroras bumbling guardians (Lesley Manville Imelda Staunton Juno Temple) prove entirely incompetent babysitters. Already a double Oscar winner for his work as an art director Stromberg knows how to visualize a scene and exactly where to place the camera but storytelling requires different muscles and the film often lurches where it ought to flow rarely latching onto the proper rhythm. It isnt until roughly halfway through the film for example that Maleficent cracks her first joke which is so out of character that it initially sounds like a blooper. While the film avoids the two-hour-plus bloat of ""Oz"" and ""The Huntsman"" this is a story that would actually benefit from some slow-paced indulgence. Or at least better instincts for where to make cuts. For example an expensive-looking yet utterly inconsequential battle sequence plopped into the middle of the pic sees Maleficent neutralize a squadron of nameless soldiers with neither motivation nor consequences but the scenes in which she bonds with the 16-year-old Aurora (Elle Fanning) - ostensibly the most important emotionally weighty relationship in the film - feel rough and rushed. While Fannings Aurora is relegated to a supporting role (and Brenton Thwaites Prince Phillip a glorified cameo) Jolie is perfectly cast in the lead and does excellent work despite substantial physical constraints. She spends the entire film wearing a prosthetic nose cheeks teeth and ears with moon-sized contact lenses and a bulky set of horns atop her head. (Master makeup magician Rick Baker is in stellar form here.) Her movements are often strictly dictated by how best to frame her silhouette. She has few lines that arent delivered as monologue and her most frequent co-stars are digitally rendered creatures. That she manages to command the screen as well as she does in spite of all this is rather remarkable. Its also a performance that begs for flourishes of high camp that the film rarely allows. When Jolie is let loose to really bare her fangs such as her nearly word-for-word re-creation of Maleficents first scene from the Disney original she strips the paint from the walls. (Her primary deviation from the script here offers a peek at the kind of unhinged delight this story could have been in braver hands as she forces Stefan to his knees and hisses ""I like you begging; do it again"" like a proper Reeperbahn dominatrix.) Yet one is much more likely to see her wordlessly glowering from behind trees and palace walls as though just another finely crafted visual effect. As for the actual effects themselves the level of craft on display here is exquisite. From the swooping shots around Stefans castle to the lava-lamp-like floral arrangements that dot Maleficents lair the films armies of art directors costumers and effects technicians aim for the spectacular with every shot and nail it with impressive consistency. Musically James Newton Howards sweeping score locates a nice sweet spot somewhere between Erich Korngold and Danny Elfman and Lana Del Reys gothy take on the ""Sleeping Beauty"" showstopper ""Once Upon a Dream"" makes for a fitting closer.

KaschK says June 15 2014 at 1120 am Its a shame the author misread the caution label on the Adivan bottle and fell asleep in the theater. Missed a great movie. One that did a GREAT job of offering an alternative take on Sleeping Beauty and filling in some back story given nobody was gonna sit there for three hours like Titanic while they dove into Maleficents super id and showed us every single detail of a story weighted down by so much BS that the kids the story was intended for just get up and walk out parents or no parents wondering how stupid adults must think they are. Kudos to the movie makers for realizing that visuals are important and not letting us down there but for keeping the movie STORY DRIVEN and never letting us lose the characters in the visuals. If it werent for how story driven Maleficent was I might be falling into one of those copout purist speeches about how the movie is going to make a lot of money and thus its only real mission is complete. Close one. Put a little scare in me for a minute there. Reply RB says June 13 2014 at 1056 pm I keep reading reviews that are so concerned with pacing narrative hiccups and comparisons to the 1950s Sleeping Beauty movie. I get that film critics think of themselves as important in terms of keeping the art form of film on its toes but seriously This is a Disney Movie. The reason this film so important has nothing to do with the finer points of movie making. Its a hugely important film because it finally brings forward in a very clear way the challenges woman face daily. If this movies story line was written using everyday people it probably wouldnt be made. Too intense a look at this ugly truth. Its a film that is finally unabashedly telling the story of how a group of women are impacted by a masculine culture focused on the accumulation of power. One is assaulted two are abandoned and three others are pressed into 16 years of service that they hate. You may laugh at this description but it is a world that global and domestic female movie audiences will find familiar. Its an extraordinary feeling to see your life and your experience of reality finally acknowledged in a masterful way on screen. And to boot you finally come out on top - not because you became a better man then the men (warring and killing) but because you were able to recover your heart despite the horrors around you even offering peace to your assailant. Yes Angelina was amazing. Yes its visually stunning. But thats not why its an instant classic and is raking in cash all over the world. Women seeing themselves overcome a most brutish cultural context is inspiring. And for women the world over it is worth seeing again and again and again. Reply Maria says June 12 2014 at 256 pm I loved this movie I think it has a great moral to boot. That being said I dont think this movie is appropriate for children under the age of ten. My sister-in-law and four year old niece went with me and my niece now has ""bad dreams"" about evil fairies coming to get her. Better wait until the little ones are old enough to understand that its just a movie. Reply Natalie says June 7 2014 at 1117 am I loved this movie and will see it again. It was funny tender at times and the performances were wonderful. It was not Sleeping Beauty...go watch the DVD if thats what you want. THIS story is Maleficents and is told as such. Stop overthinking everything and sit back and enjoy. Reply J.A. says June 1 2014 at 737 am We have watched the movie Each moviegoers have their own opinion depend on which side you go for. Other watch for their idol other watch to ridicule.. Mine is for my idol as well as to understand Maleficent side...this is one perfect story with a twist that is quite touching. A story of good and a bad you can relay certain plot interpreted in todays human weaknesses and capabilities..watch it and you will be amazed the additional details to the original version of Sleeping Beauty.. Reply bartieflores63yahoo.com says June 1 2014 at 125 am The film had many layers of human emotions . Puppy love  greed self pityrevengeanger  bitterness paranoiaobsession and most importantly forgiveness .the visual effects awesome Robert Stroberg s directors debut a home run. Dudes a two time Oscar winner .I hope he directs many films to come So Reviewer who ever you are. Open your mind and go watch the film again. Reply Mo says June 2 2014 at 339 pm This film was so poorly directed - no sense of timing pacing or tone. If you really want to see more films directed by this director you will probably need to finance them Plus changing everything into BIZARRO WORLD (where everything is the opposite) is not a way to win a lot of fans. Why not have Cruella DeVil join PETA? Why not have Jesus be the evil king of hell and have lucifer be the good son of God? Reply KaschK says June 15 2014 at 1125 am U mad? jawan says May 31 2014 at 541 am Cant wait ta see it Reply Marie says May 30 2014 at 515 pm If youre expecting this film to follow the story like the original film did then youre going to be disappointed. Reply Gary Lacey says May 29 2014 at 434 pm I was wondering about the Brad Pitt attack by a crasher if it was a stunt or for real. Well Im inclined toward a stunt I hear the movie needs help. Reply Marie says May 30 2014 at 240 am ""Im inclined toward a stunt"" Yea...they paid someone to attack Brad to bring more attention to this movie. Even though this movie already have attention. Have you seen how many views the trailers have on Youtube? If youre going to troll then you have to try a little harder. Reply 30dBRebecca (30dBRebecca) says May 29 2014 at 758 am While the film may be less than inspired the twittersphere is a buzz with anticipation for Angelina in horns. Maleficent indexes at 73% positive in Twitter. Evil indeed has a beautiful face just watch those sharp cheekbones. http//www.30db.com/opinions/%23Maleficent?startDate=20140130amp;endDate=20140529 Reply Jessica Dwyer says May 28 2014 at 528 pm They cut out a chunk of backstory for the character. At one point the film was over 2 hrs. So they cut character development and two great actors in Miranda Richardson and Peter Capaldi who I believe played either her parents or her aunt and uncle. Reply KaschK says June 15 2014 at 1136 am And so how long was this kids movie that apparently is too scary for American kids to handle before they reach junior high school supposed to be? Three hours? Four hours? And so when the whining about how the filmmakers ""forgot who their audience was"" kick in how long can I slap the whiners before my hands actually turn numb? Three hours? Four hours? Because once the movie goes that long this is exactly what well hear next. That the filmmakers were self indulgent took too many liberties to retain the right to call the movie ""Maleficent"" abandoned their supposed target audience yada yada yada so tired of this market and the predictable simpleton dullards that its comprised of. Idiocracy had it right. Just make a movie with two hours of a naked butt center screen and be done with it. Reply JM says May 28 2014 at 423 pm Why is she called Maleficent if she wasnt evil when she was younger. This sounds as false as as a nice and young Cruella De Vil working for PETA until a problem made her bitter. But anyway she was called Cruella DEVIL. Dont they pay people to think in Hollywood? Reply KaschK says June 15 2014 at 1142 am Uhh...no. As a matter of fact the dont pay people to think in Hollywood. They DO pay people to think in Washington however. And you see how thats worked out. So from where do you derive justification for the lofty settings on your bar? Reply AJ says May 30 2014 at 827 am Oh my goodness thank you for this. As a life long Maleficent fan I nearly walked out of the theatre. They transformed her from a sweeping elegant powerful villain to a simple uninteresting fairy whos only ""evil"" deed is trying to punish the man who betrayed her. Of course they kept her name and horns the same as if thats supposed to make up for the fact that theyve stripped Disneys best villain of all her best and most interesting qualities and powers. Reply Chelsea says May 28 2014 at 409 pm I will wait and see what Jeremy Jahns thinks of the movie. Reply Marie says May 28 2014 at 1253 pm Hollywood needs to stop making these movies and the gullible public shouldnt flock en mass to see them SWATH was awful too. Charles Perrault would be ashamed to see his characters being used like by the Hollywood machine. Reply Jacques Shellac says May 28 2014 at 1049 am Compare this to the brilliantly pitiless portrayal of King Joffrey by Jack Gleeson. Gives you an idea of what a great actor can do when they arent overwhelmed by their own huge ego. Reply Dez Nolan says May 28 2014 at 1031 am Again Hollywood picks visuals gt; emotional journey. Hey heres a thought maybe in a film with a central female character try a female director RevolutionaryIdeas Reply Kevin says May 30 2014 at 941 am The film had a female writer. What say you now? Reply ITTTY IT says May 28 2014 at 408 am Pre-dickd-Abel same-same franchise slum slop. THOSE in search os something bracing powerful and relevant in the fantasy genre? CHECK OUT Disneys 1940 ---PINOCCHIO. It will show you whats going on. It will show you where you are. Reply Cyndi Quintero says May 28 2014 at 215 am yawn Reply Blake Davenport says May 28 2014 at 1253 am So the connection to the past Disney sleeping beauty is irrelevant? I just dont get what this writer is saying Reply Luis says May 28 2014 at 1152 am I saw this last night and it basically starts off very strong like a tale of its own but in the end it rushes back to attempt and come close to tying up to the original sleeping beauty but with a twist. Its true Prince Philips appearance is a forced glorified cameo. Reply Michael G says May 28 2014 at 209 am The writer is saying the film sucks. But its pretty to look at. Reply bartieflores63yahoo.com says June 1 2014 at 133 am Lessons of life in this film is my take  like holding a grudge is not worth it .the film a 7 on a scale of 1to 10 go check it out peeps  go with a open mind remember your youth ( Kevin says May 30 2014 at 942 am And the writer is absolutely correct.

New Summer Movie Season Same Sad Story (Guest Blog) The villain of ""Sleeping Beauty"" gets to be the hero in smart (but visually hideous) story that injects post-""Frozen"" female empowerment into an old chestnut With ""Maleficent"" we may be getting the closest Disney will ever come to ""Ms. 45"" Abel Ferraras bloody cult favorite about a woman (Zoe Tamerlis Lund) hunting down and murdering the men who raped her. At the same time it carries on in the ""Frozen"" tradition (no doubt coincidentally since both films were in production at the same time) of liberating two-dimensional storybook characters from their shackles and allowing them to be as emotionally rich heroic and independent as their male counterparts. The premise of turning the memorably wicked witch from ""Sleeping Beauty"" into a protagonist might seem like a gimmick that would quickly fizzle out but screenwriter Linda Woolverton (""Beauty and the Beast"") with a great assist from Angelina Jolie offers a ""Wicked""-style do-over that results in a movie thats as entertaining as it is bold. See video Angelina Jolie Discusses Reinvention of Disneys Maleficent in New Preview (Video) While the visuals fall prey to some unpleasant trends in modern moviemaking -- several CG characters have an ugly misshapenness that recalls ""Jack the Giant Slayer"" and the magical forest lands resemble a toilet-paper commercial -- ""Maleficent"" throws out much of the original tales bathwater without losing the baby. Its as a very young girl in fact that we first meet Maleficent (Isobelle Molloy and then Ella Purnell as a teen). This winged horned fairy lives in a magical ruler-less kingdom where mythical creatures frolic whereas the neighboring land is ruled over by the cruel and selfish King Henry (Kenneth Cranham). One day a poor young boy named Stefan is caught stealing a jewel from the lake and after Maleficent makes him return the stone she befriends the boy and over the years they become friends and in her eyes romantically involved. (The fact that ""maleficent"" is an actual adjective with an actual definition is never mentioned in the film even though the character is at first sweet-natured and kind.) When Maleficent grows to adulthood King Henry tries to conquer her land but she and the other creatures (including walking trees) repel his forces. On his deathbed Henry (who has a daughter but no sons) vows to bequeath his crown to the man who can deliver him Maleficents head. Grown-up Stefan (Sharlto Copley) visits her and slips her a mickey; too cowardly to kill her in her sleep he nonetheless violates her person by removing her wings and delivering them to Henry. This evil act blackens Maleficents heart; she takes over the magical kingdom and surrounds it with thorns. And when word comes out that King Stefan and his wife have given birth to the princess Aurora out comes the spinning-wheel curse. Also read Angelina Jolies Maleficent Tracking for 60 Million-Plus Box-Office Opening Keeping a close eye on Aurora with the help of her crow familiar Diaval (Sam Riley ""On the Road"") Maleficent winds up saving the babys life from neglect at the hands of her bumbling magical minders Knotgrass (Imelda Staunton) Thistletwit (Juno Temple) and Flittle (Lesley Manville). Over time it turns out not even Maleficent can hold a grudge for 16 years but shes made a curse so specific that not even she can unbreak it. Will this witch become the parent that teenage Aurora (Elle Fanning) has longed for her whole life or will the sins of the past destroy everyone in both kingdoms? If youre expecting Jolie to deliver purring sarcasm in the pursed-lipped raised-eyebrow mold of Agnes Moorehead on ""Bewitched"" fear not -- she absolutely does. Rest assured however that she offers up this character in many moods and modes turning what was a striking but fairly single-minded villain into a fully fleshed-out woman. She has known pain and she has felt anger yes but she is also capable of love and compassion. Also read Kristin Chenoweth to Play Maleficent in Disney Channels Descendants The rest of the characters granted seem mostly along just to keep the plot moving but if youre going to build a film around one character and one performance Jolies turn as Maleficent makes such a strategy seem like a good idea. The aggressively unpleasant visuals certainly detract from the overall film but ""Maleficent"" makes for a fascinating entry in an ongoing wave of projects that give ""bad"" women of literature a chance to present their side of the story.
