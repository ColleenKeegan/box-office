By Anthony Lane Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson reunite in Stillers new film.   Credit Illustration by Ben Kirchner Fifteen years have passed since ""Zoolander""--fifteen summers with the length of fifteen long winters How we have ached to see once more those noble features. And here they are in ""Zoolander 2"" bearded sadder and yet somehow no wiser than before. Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) who embodied everything that we look for in a male model managed to lose his career his wife the custody of his son and his ineffable mojo. Since then he has dwelt alone ""as a hermit crab"" in a hut among snowy mountains. Thence he is summoned to rejoin the fray on the orders of Alexanya Atoz (Kristen Wiig) the most lordly designer of the moment. Although a blizzard is howling he sets off unbowed like a polar explorer and trudges all of ten feet before reaching the haven of an Uber car. ""Zoolander 2"" is the sixth feature that Stiller has directed. The first was ""Reality Bites"" (1994) and ever since while his movies have grown more unreal bittiness has remained his method of choice. Characters flit in and out scorning development and when in doubt he tosses generous handfuls of gags at the screen. The new film like its predecessor is rich in malapropism (""A total laughing stick"") and Stiller even conjures a touch of sweet regret when Derek landing in Rome encounters his former rival Hansel (Owen Wilson) and finds the good grace to admit ""I miss not knowing things with you."" This Masonic ideal--that human beings wherever they come from and whatever their differences can be bound in a brotherhood of cretins--is an endearing one but it keeps bumping into the plot. Derek and Hansel have to start knowing things and even to learn about themselves and wheres the fun in that? Their ignorance was our bliss. The news is that pop stars including Madonna and Justin Bieber are being mercilessly slain. Interpol in the person of Valentina Valencia (Penelope Cruz) steps in to halt the massacre. So far the only clue is that every star pre-death is striking a final pose. In fact its one of Dereks poses not ""Blue Steel"" not ""Le Tigre"" not the inimitable ""Magnum"" but an old one that was used to sell ""Aqua Vitae."" (We get to see the commercial in question. It features half of Stiller most of a cow and all of Naomi Campbell.) At this point the story line goes wild but the wildness sadly is not of the Preston Sturges kind with men and women dispatched in the direction where they most fear to tread. Instead there is frantic flailing with a scene in the Garden of Eden an orgy attended by a hippo genuflections toward ""The Da Vinci Code"" and to cap it all Sting dressed as a monk. A technical puzzle how many celebrity cameos can a film contain before it passes from the droll into the tiresome? The thought of watching Willie Nelson Neil deGrasse Tyson Katy Perry and Susan Boyle in the same movie is believe me far more diverting than the actuality and the awkwardness deepens in ""Zoolander 2"" which harbors some vague desire to make sport of the fashion industry. The first film scored a few palpable hits but the new one barely makes the effort and the poise of a work like ""Funny Face"" which both mocked and feted a devotion to couture seems an impossible dream. Instead we suffer the shame of a grand finale at which various bigwigs--Valentino Tommy Hilfiger Kate Moss and so forth--flaunt their well-cut sense of humor deliver their lines poorly and reinforce their fame. I admired the raging sneer with which Mugatu (Will Ferrell) Dereks nemesis of old turns to Marc Jacobs and addresses him as ""Marc by Marc Jacobs"" but in all honesty how much of a creative risk is it to show that you can take a joke when the joke is no more wounding than a back rub? The new Marvel picture ""Deadpool"" stars Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson a Special Forces veteran who to the dismay of his fiancee Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) develops terminal cancer. He is approached by someone who promises not merely to cure him but to arm him with extravagant powers. Both promises are kept but at a cost for Wade is disfigured by the treatment. Ashamed he stays away from Vanessa stitches a suit of red leather and a matching mask and assumes the name Deadpool. He also embarks on a plan to destroy the man who altered his looks. If that were common practice Beverly Hills would have the highest murder rate in the land. Rumor has insisted for years on the game-changing audacity of ""Deadpool."" Here was the film that would drag the superhero genre into risky realms shearing away the moral fretfulness that has turned Spider-Man for instance into a flying wuss. The ambition is laudable but Tim Millers movie far from seeming reckless and loose-limbed comes across as pathologically calculated measuring out its nastiness to the last drop. That is equally true of the visual excess--three heads bursting bloodily open in slow motion one after the next as a bullet travels through them--and of the dialogue which rubs its hands with glee and tries so very very hard to sound barbaric. Deadpools appearance according to a friend of his looks as if ""Freddy Krueger face-fucked a topographical map of Utah."" Watching the film is like sitting at dinner with a teen-ager who believes that if he swears long and loudly enough he will shock the grownups into accepting him as one of their own. To be fair however the opening credits are a blast ""Produced by Asshats"" ""Directed by an Overpaid Tool."" You said it guys not me. The latest film from the Danish director Tobias Lindholm is ""A War."" His previous film was ""A Hijacking"" (2012). We can but hope that before long he hauls a crew to Elsinore and makes a new movie of ""Hamlet"" under the title ""A Dane."" In the case of ""A War"" which is set partly in Afghanistan and which has earned an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Language Film the indefinite article matters a lot. We are left with the impression that the fight against the Taliban is just one war among many and that the stress of combat whether in action or in its aftermath affects more than the military alone. The dialogue at the start consists largely of numbers and commands ""6-0 2-5 here. Stand by for partial 9-liner."" Danish soldiers are on patrol advancing in single file for safetys sake. But nothing is safe; explosive devices are planted below the scrub awaiting the pressure of a foot. When the worst occurs the company commander Claus Michael Pedersen (Pilou Asbaek) back at base handles the situation with his customary calm. He also decides to set an example by leading patrols himself from now on. His courage will come back to haunt him. Every so often we quit the heat and dust of the conflict and return to Denmark. There under cloudier skies Pedersens wife Maria (Tuva Novotny) raises their three children and reassures him in long-distance calls that alls well on the home front--not easy when the middle kid Jakob (Terkel Sand) confused and angered by his fathers absence harms a fellow-student at school. Then comes an awful evening when the youngest of the Pedersens ends up on a stomach pump in the E.R. During the procedure our gaze is concentrated on the mothers face and Novotny offers a wonderful portrait of someone who is only just--by a tremulous inch--keeping everything together. You could argue that domestic alarms are no big deal when placed beside the conditions in which the soldiers toil. What Lindholm wants to establish though is a continuum of anxiety. His mission is to snap at our nerves and to touch off small ironic echoes all over the map. Jakob refusing to get out of the car stubborn as ever reminds us of his fathers platoon hustling Afghans from their vehicle at gunpoint. Halfway through against expectation these two streams of narrative converge. A difficult decision made by Pedersen amid the welter of battle brings him home before his tour of duty is done and the bulk of the remaining tale unfolds in a courtroom. The pressure of preparing for the verdict is as fraught as anything we witnessed on patrol and Asbaek--who will soon be joining ""Game of Thrones"" for its new season--winds the mood yet tighter by giving away so little. His eyes plus the stillness of his posture do most of the work. In contrast to this emotional rigor the informality of the legal process verges on the comic; the defendant and his attorney wear open shirts and sweaters in the same way that Pedersen in Afghanistan is woken without a salute by one of his subordinates who then enjoys a cup of coffee and a good cry. The movie is memorable and draining but ""Full Metal Jacket"" it is not.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

(He beat Chris Evans who played the Human Torch and then Captain America by a nose.) But with his encore turn as the protagonist of Deadpool Reynolds is now alone in the distinction of having played titular characters from both principal comic-book universes Marvel (Deadpool) and DC (Green Lantern). As such he is a near-perfect test case for the different paths the two companies have chosen in their adaptations from page to screen. Related Story Green Lantern Revenge of the Lame Superhero Movie Green Lantern was a terrible terrible terrible movie. As the hot-shot-test-pilot-turned-galactic-policeman Hal Jordan Reynolds was intended to be an amusing wisecracker a la Tony Stark. But the movie failed so utterly that DC famously (if only allegedly) instituted a ""no jokes"" policy for all its subsequent properties (Superman Batman Wonder Woman etc.). This was in a word idiotic. Green Lantern didnt fail because it was funny; it failed because it was painfully unfunny a sour tale full of unlikable characters. Moreover its hard to imagine more dispositive proof that humor and superheroing are compatible than the ongoing mega-success of Marvel Studios which has ridden a light comic touch to approximately one gazillion dollars in box office over the past several years.But anyone still seeking additional proof need look no further than Deadpool. Crass profane and intermittently quite funny the directorial debut of animator Tim Miller inaugurates a new genre hybrid the super-bromedy. Reynolds stars as Wade Wilson a former special-forces soldier currently working as a low-rent vigilante-for-hire roughing up stalkers and the like. (Or as Wade himself puts it ""Im just a bad guy who gets paid to fuck up worse guys."") Carousing in a bar he meets the love of his life an escort named Vanessa (Morena Baccarin). Following a montage that features more sex than every other superhero movie to date combined Wade proposes marriage. And then he discovers that he has terminal cancer.Wade leaves Vanessa and volunteers for a murky experimental procedure that promises to cure him by triggering latent mutations. (Its perhaps worth noting here that the rights to the Deadpool character are owned by 20th Century Fox so he inhabits the same super-verse as the X-Men rather than that of the Avengers et al.) What Wade doesnt know is that the procedure in question involves his being tortured to the brink of death for weeks (months?) on end--nor that should it succeed his tormenters (Ed Skrein Gina Carano) intend to turn him into a super-slave. The procedure ultimately does succeed granting Wade miraculous regenerative abilities but also a terrible case of full-body psoriasis. He escapes vows revenge on the people who did this to him and adopts the moniker Deadpool. From there the movie proceeds in pretty much the manner you would expect.As is perhaps evident from that summary Deadpool doesnt have a great deal to offer plot-wise The arc is predictable the villains forgettable and the Big Finale relatively small. Its true that the movie is more extreme in its violence than is customary--Deadpool favors swords and pistols over his fists--but where it truly breaks new ground is in its tone. Flamboyantly vulgar and determinedly self-referential Deadpool has the shape of a superhero movie but the soul of a Danny McBride flick.For those in the mood for its super-powered low-brow Deadpool offers an eminently amusing diversion.The college-lampoon mood is set early with a title sequence promising among other characters ""a British villain"" and ""a sexy chick"" and explaining that the film is produced by ""some asshole"" and written by ""the real heroes here."" (Those would be co-writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick.) Over the course of the movie Reynolds will spend far less time fighting bad guys than he will offering crude commentary demolishing the fourth wall making X-Men inside jokes and occasionally all three at once--e.g.  ""Whose balls did I have to fondle to get my own movie? I cant tell you but his name rhymes with Pulverine."" Theres a gag riffing on Monty Pythons ""Black Knight"" sequence another that recalls a bit from Stripes and a third that borrows from Saw (and before it the original Mad Max). And there is of course a barb hurled in the direction of Reynoldss failed earlier franchise ""Please dont make the super-suit green""Reynolds brings admirable charm to the parade of puerility and he gets welcome backup from T.J. Miller who plays bartender/best friend ""Weasel"" with the same sloppy brio he brings to Erlich Bachman on Silicon Valley. There are appearances by X-Men both second- (Colossus) and third-tier (Negasonic Teenage Warhead) and more than one joke about how they couldnt afford to feature bigger stars given the movies budget. (Whats less clear is whether its deliberate that Colossuss shoddy CGI makes him look like a man in a foam rubber suit thats been spray-painted chrome.) Tucked away in there is a likable bit part for 72-year-old Leslie Uggams as the foulmouthed blind lady with whom Wade takes up residence. And although it almost seems beside the point first-time director Miller keeps the film moving along and shows a solid knack for action choreography.Does it all add up to much? No. Is the movie as clever or subversive as it imagines itself to be? No. But for those in the mood for its super-powered low-brow Deadpool offers an eminently amusing diversion and an object lesson in the elasticity of the genre. Or to put it another way Its a hell of a lot funnier than Green Lantern. This article originally stated that Ryan Reynolds was the first actor to play multiple superhero roles in movies made by both Marvel and DC Comics. In fact Halle Berry was the first.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed.

""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion. Continue Reading Charles Mostoller / Reuters Can Personality Be Changed? Scott Barry Kaufman Psychologists have long debated how flexible someones ""true"" self is. Almost everyone has something they want to change about their personality. In 2014 a study that traced peoples goals for personality change found that the vast majority of its subjects wanted to be more extraverted agreeable emotionally stable and open to new experiences. A whopping 97 percent said they wished they were more conscientious. These desires appeared to be rooted in dissatisfaction. People wanted to become more extraverted if they werent happy with their sex lives hobbies or friendships. They wanted to become more conscientious if they were displeased with their finances or schoolwork. The findings reflect the social psychologist Roy Baumeisters notion of ""crystallization of discontent"" Once people begin to recognize larger patterns of shortcomings in their lives he contends they may reshuffle their core values and priorities to justify improving things.

Entertainment ""Deadpool"" Is No Antidote For Superhero Fatigue The subversiveness of Ryan Reynolds motormouthed new movie is only mutated-skin-deep. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Brianna Hildebrand Ryan Reynolds and Stefan Kapicic in Deadpool. Twentieth Century Fox ID 7974767 The best joke Deadpool makes at the expense of superhero movies is in its opening credits. As the camera glides through a frozen scene of car-flipping chaos onscreen text announces that the movie stars ""Gods Perfect Idiot"" (Ryan Reynolds face fluttering by on the cover of a People magazine as the title character aka Wade Wilson) ""A Hot Chick"" (Morena Baccarin as his girlfriend Vanessa Carlysle) and ""A British Villain"" (Ed Skrein as Ajax). Its directed by ""An Overpaid Tool"" (Tim Miller). It suggests you be ready for ""A Gratuitous Cameo"" which turns out to be an appearance from Stan Lee -- we are in Marvel territory after all and some things are unavoidable.Its a bold beginning for what is after all the latest superhero saga (and the first of a planned seven due out this year) -- one that openly breaks down the reigning blockbuster genre into some of its most interchangeable component parts. Its the promise of a film thats self-aware and that therefore knows better though only the first part of that suggestion turns out to be true. View this image > Skrein in Deadpool. Joe Lederer / Twentieth Century Fox ID 7974838 Deadpool written by Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese in keeping true to its fourth-wall-breaking wisecracking sword-wielding mutant main character makes countless self-referential jokes about its own existence. It acknowledges Reynolds previous turn as a version of Deadpool back in 2009s unfortunate X-Men Origins Wolverine. It gibes about Hugh Jackman and how confusing X-Men movie continuity has gotten. It mentions franchises and sequels and the studio only being able to afford two X-Men for Deadpool (that would be Colossus voiced by Stefan Kapicic and Negasonic Teenage Warhead played by Brianna Hildebrand).Its fun for a while and then it all becomes deeply disheartening because calling attention to the more businesslike mechanics of superheroics isnt subversive when youre also playing right into them. Pointing out the symptoms of superhero fatigue isnt the same thing as overcoming it.Deadpool is the peak instance of the mainstream movie trend of tipping a hat to studio cynicism without really departing from it. Take for instance the hilarious barrage of increasingly halfhearted sequel concepts at the end of 22 Jump Street the deliciousness of which was only slightly decreased by the news a few months later that a third film was actually in the works. Then there was the Jurassic World moment when the teenage lead took a phone call while behind him the T. rex tore apart a goat -- a centerpiece scene from the 1993 movie turned into a backdrop as a nod to the need to keep jaded audiences entertained with ever-bigger action sequences. There was also Ant-Mans whole Hope van Dyne storyline which was like a built-in apologia about how the reasons for not having a female lead in a superhero movie are dumb. But we didnt get a female lead in the one we were watching anyway. View this image > Reynolds and Baccarin in Deadpool. Twentieth Century Fox ID 7974797 But Deadpool is on a whole other level -- a movie that puts its audaciousness in the forefront even if its only mutated-skin-deep; a movie that makes space for violence sex and swear words but never bites the hand feeding it by diverging from formula. Early in the film Wade pauses the action to tell the audience mid-skewering someone ""Youre probably thinking My boyfriend said this was a superhero movie"" before assuring everyone that hes no hero and that this in fact is a love story.Its a self-congratulatory bit that rings phony twice over -- first in its creaky assumption that the women in the crowd wouldnt be there of their own volition and second in pretending that beneath the R-rating Deadpools story isnt a standard-issue supe one of getting powers fighting bad guys and winning (back) the girl. Sure he kills people but theyre all evil and mostly faceless -- theres none of the discomfort of honest-to-god moral ambiguity.But at least he has a good time doing it. Deadpool is the kind of role Reynolds whos often miscast was meant to play -- one in which his unshakable smirking edge works with the character rather against him. Reynolds is at his best playing smartasses with hearts of gold and he makes Wades compulsive motormouthedness tolerable for longer than it should be especially when playing off T.J. Miller as Wades bartender friend and sidekick Weasel the only character in the movie who can keep pace with him. View this image > Reynolds and Leslie Uggams in Deadpool. Joe Lederer / Twentieth Century Fox ID 7974816 Baccarin cant though its not her fault -- her character is a Disney version of a sex worker who falls in love with the one trick we see her turn and who makes all the right pop culture references. ""Its like I made you in a computer"" Wade exclaims at one point which of all the calling-bullshit-on-itself-before-anyone-else-can moments in the movie is the one that stings the most -- the open labeling of the romantic lead/MacGuffin of this self-proclaimed love story as a shrugging fantasy. Shes as much an accessory as the red suit Wade sews for himself.Superhero sagas arent in general built to be daring. Theres no benefit -- not until the current model stops working. Theyre commodified and expensive -- even if Deadpools budget is reportedly lower than the norm -- and they have to serve many masters guided more by the vision of executives focused on global markets and planning years out than they are by filmmakers trying to make a good standalone picture. This doesnt mean there isnt room to take chances just that theres little motivation for it -- and what Deadpool sells is a very safe form of acting out all surface with a timid center the movie equivalent of a kid who wears a T-shirt with a swear word on it to school in giddy anticipation of what Mom will say when they get sent home. The satisfaction it offers lasts as long as it takes to consider how when a character flips off the camera hes also flipping off the audience.

Monitor Movie Guide ""Deadpool"" isnt exactly dead in the water but its strictly for Marvel Comics fans who like their characters sloshing in R-rated territory. Weirdly funny at best its just exhaustingly weird most of the time.Ryan Reynolds is Wade Wilson/Deadpool a mercenary who is bioengineered by big bad guy Ajax (Ed Skrein) into a fighter incapable of dying. Whenever he is shot or maimed or de-limbed Deadpool costumed in red-and-black spandex to resemble a cut-rate Spider-Man simply heals himself. He doesnt like to call himself a superhero but what else would you call him? Super-anti-hero I guess.Reynolds brings a lewd flippancy to the role and director Tim Miller and his writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick have some fun at Marvels expense. But this fun is a essentially a rebranding of the brand; it seems less irreverent than self-congratulatory.

Barry Hertz The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday Feb. 10 2016 1128AM EST Last updated Wednesday Feb. 10 2016 1128AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Tim Miller Written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick Starring Ryan Reynolds Morena Baccarin T.J. Miller Classification 18A Year 2016 Country USA Language English Last month Disney chief executive Bob Iger sat down for an interview with the BBC and uttered a sentence that horrified most of the film worlds highbrow crowd - or at least those who consider themselves above the pleasures of a superhero blockbuster ""[With] Marvel youre dealing with thousands and thousands of characters - that will go on forever."" Forever yes. Nobody should have been surprised by Igers statement; the man is in the business of making comic-book movies and his company is obviously going to keep doing so until it has exploited every possible avenue of profit. But that doesnt mean were all doomed to an eternity of rote superhero formulaics - films where the wisecracking white-bread hero saves the day while doing everything right for all the right reasons.Like any other cinematic genre the superhero movie is one ripe with opportunity for invention - even subversion. Hollywood may envision a never-ending future of spandex-heavy adventures but like the once-inescapable and once-beloved western the superhero film can be twisted and torqued to last for decades. Weve already witnessed some mild pivots the sleek and gory vision of Guillermo del Toros Blade II for instance or the crude and immoral antics of Kick-Ass. As some filmmakers - and the daring or possibly oblivious studios behind them - have come to realize if we must live in an era of superheroes lets at least make things interesting.To call the new film Deadpool merely interesting though would be an understatement. It stars not a patriotic Ubermensch out to protect the world but a reprehensible killing machine interested only in literally saving his own face. His superpowers arent flashy just gross. And his weapons of choice arent mighty fists that knock out - yet never kill - but assault rifles grenades and swords soaked in enemy blood.In short Deadpool is everything that Hollywood has raised audiences to believe heroes are not crass selfish and with a vocabulary that would have made George Carlin blush. Yet here he is on the big screen slicing and dicing his way through his own origin story one that somehow exists within the squeaky-clean X-Men cinematic universe (but not I should note the ""official"" Marvel Cinematic Universe that houses the Avengers and Groot the talking tree; I could explain why that is but lets not bog things down here with a long legal history of inter-studio warfare).The plot is refreshingly simple and low-stakes. Deadpool (a.k.a. Wade Wilson a.k.a. the walking talking smirk that is actor Ryan Reynolds) is a simple mercenary whos out for revenge after a generic British bad guy (Ed Skrein) mutates him leaving his face a scarred Freddy Krueger-like wreck. There are a few side characters in the mix - including a disappointingly one-note hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold girlfriend played with verve by Morena Baccarin - and amusing cameos but this is mostly Deadpools show and hes eager to steal it.The film has long been a passion project for Reynolds - who played a watered-down version of the same character in X-Men Origins Wolverine - and the actor clearly relishes the opportunity. His Deadpool is an irrepressibly charming madman - as if a standup comedian decided one day to drop the mic and pick up a Glock. If Reynolds lays it on a bit thick here and there and everywhere its only because hes scared 20th Century Fox will wake up and realize what theyve unleashed upon the world and hell never get such a chance again. (Its not every day that a major studio film for instance features a love scene in which the hero is sodomized by his girlfriend in a loving act of sexual exploration.)Yet it would be dishonest to call Deadpool something truly subversive. Sure the title character often pauses the violent action to break the fourth wall and there are many winking meta-references to the genre as a whole including Reynolds disastrous outing as Green Lantern. But first-time feature director Tim Miller has created a work thats both aggressive and not aggressive enough.Deadpool is a cold-blooded killer but one who still must save a damsel in distress. Hes a smart-ass but only about half of his jokes land. And while the films violence takes squishy delight in showing how real-world bodies would react to otherworldly superpowers the action is strangely muted in sections and poorly executed in others. Its cultural irreverence designed for the mainstream.Still as Iger and the rest of Hollywood prepare for an endless era of comic-book franchises its heartening to glimpse a future where not everything is wrapped up in a tidy package. As Deadpool himself well knows sometimes you just have to play dirty.

It blurs the lines between audience screen and cinematic universe so thoroughly that watching it is like having Deadpool sitting next to you in the theater riffing on the film and spilling popcorn onto your lap.All of which could be incredibly annoying and the films use of lowbrow fratboy insults is grating. But otherwise ""Deadpool"" is a very funny very wild ride that takes comic book movies to a new level of self-reflexivity.Credit rookie director Tim Miller writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick and star Ryan Reynolds with setting fire to the Marvel Universe model and turning it into their own house of mirrors. It starts during the opening credits when Reynolds is credited not by name but as ""Gods Perfect Idiot"" alongside a shot of his 2010 People magazine ""Sexiest Man Alive"" cover. (Other cast members are credited as ""Some Hot Chick"" ""British Villain"" and ""Gratuitous Cameo."")Reynolds has never meshed as well with a character or found a better outlet for his smirking smart aleck persona. Hes been somewhat adrift since 2011 when ""Green Lantern"" let off a stinkbomb thats stench has lingered for years. He followed it up with a string of limp flops including ""R.I.P.D."" and ""Self/Less"" (yikes even the titles are awful) but ""Deadpool"" rescues him from that cinematic swamp.He plays Wade Wilson a low-rent vigilante who describes himself as ""a bad guy who gets paid to (mess) up worse guys."" He meets and falls in love with a prostitute named Vanessa (""Homelands"" Morena Baccarin) and together they have a warm believable sexual chemistry. But Wilson receives a terminal cancer diagnosis that drives a wedge into their life plans.Wilson meets a shady figure who offers him a cure for his disease and puts him in contact with Ajax (aforementioned British villain Ed Skrein) a mad doctor who experiments with Wilsons body. He mutates his genes giving him rapid powers of regeneration but leaves him horribly scarred and left for dead. After escaping the lab Wilson reinvents himself as Deadpool donning a red suit and mask while seeking revenge against the doctor and his goons who kidnap Vanessa.Deadpool doesnt dismantle his victims like most superheroes; he shoots stabs and does all sorts of R-rated things to them. This is a movie where bodies (and brains) go splat; as Deadpool himself says ""I may be super but Im no hero."" Great power and great responsibility can take a hike.The attitude of the character and the film are supercharged and the movie goes all the way with its post-modernism; at one point a song on the soundtrack narrates the on-screen action. Plenty of other films have commented on genre conventions and played with fourth-wall barriers -- ""Last Action Hero"" was an example of how not to do it -- but ""Deadpool"" hits just the right tone. Its deeply sarcastic without being cynical or sour.Marvel being Marvel ""Deadpool"" takes up residency in the larger ""X Men"" universe where Reynolds character was introduced in 2009s ""X Men Origins Wolverine."" A pair of ""X Men"" characters Colossus (voice of Stefan Kapicic) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (newcomer Brianna Hildebrand) figure prominently in the picture and make strong sidekicks for our hero.But this is Deadpools story and he leaves a lasting impression while annihilating the genre.

"Deadpool | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; deadpool ) Deadpool (United States/Canada 2016) February 11 2016 A movie review by James Berardinelli Contains minor spoilers. Deadpool is subversive. Its the first major comic book movie to venture this deep into satire and one of the rare ones to earn an R-rating. For those who feel superhero films have become stale and predictable Deadpool provides as much of a shock to the system as the ice water bucket challenge. More often than not fans have griped about the way bits and pieces of the Marvel pantheon were rented off to Sony and 20th Century Fox back in the 1990s. Fox because of its incompetent handling of Fantastic Four have earned the lions share of criticism. In the case of Deadpool however we can perhaps be thankful that the character falls under Foxs umbrella. It would be hard to imagine the powers that be at Disney allowing this kind of flippant entry into their carefully constructed Marvel Cinematic Universe. Compared to Deadpool Guardians of the Galaxy is a bastion of sobriety and good taste. Deadpool has the potential to appeal to those who have grown weary of the superhero genre. There are no sacred cows and everything that can be lampooned is lampooned. As snarky as the environment is however an element of homage still exists. Deadpool has a heart (even if its sometimes a little difficult to find). The movies voiceover narrative states that this is a love story and in the end thats what it proves to be. As ludicrous as the Valentines Day release might seem it fits after a fashion. The origin story is buried in flashback. The ""present time"" introduces us to the title character (played by Ryan Reynolds) who has some anger management issues. Forced to wear a mask because his face looks like cottage cheese he pursues his lifes ambition with an admirable single-mindedness. That goal find and kill Ajax (Ed Skrein) the man responsible for his immortality and his ugliness. He blames Ajax for severing his connection with his soulmate Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) as well as subjecting him to inhuman torture. Deadpools obsession with ridding the world of Ajax and his henchwoman Angel Dust (Gina Carano) is viewed unfavorably by the X-Men who dispatch mutants Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) to thwart the homicidal elements of his revenge plot. Deadpool is a classic anti-hero and as such he earns our respect because he isnt bound by the rules of morality and propriety that hamstring many traditional comic book heroes. Deadpool has no compunctions about killing maiming and torturing. He doesnt do these things without reason but given even the flimsiest of excuses hes not afraid to dirty his hands. The movies offbeat style the credit for which can be spread among director Tim Miller the screenwriters and Ryan Reynolds thrives on so-called ""fourth wall breaking."" Not only does Deadpool talk directly to the audience but hes aware that hes in a movie and speaks openly about the genre. At one point when told hes being taken to see Professor X he glibly responds ""Which one? Stewart or Mcavoy?"" Deadpool fuses the attitude of Kick-Ass with the self-awareness of Scream. We know from the opening credits that this is going to be a very different kind of comic book movie and the running length is short enough (about 105 minutes) that we dont tire of the quirkiness. According to Reynolds Deadpool is the last superhero-type he will play. This isnt the first time he has worn the costume - he previously appeared in the forgettable first stand-alone Wolverine movie. Reynolds however is perhaps best known in the comic book universe for his participation in the disastrously received Green Lantern movie. He was also in movie adaptations of Blade Trinity and R.I.P.D. lending credence to the calls from some fans that he shouldnt be allowed near a comic book property. He gets it right with Deadpool. His tongue-in-cheek approach is perfect for the role and he brings sufficient humanity to the character that we find ourselves reluctantly caring about Wade Wilsons fate. Earlier drafts of the script added more mutants to the action but in the end only Colossus and the bizarrely-named Negasonic Teenage Warhead appear. The movie isnt special effects-heavy (at least not to the degree that most superhero movies are) but some of the budget was lavished on those characters. Neither Gina Caranos  Angel Dust nor Ed Skreins Ajax represents villainy at its most impressive but their limitations arent a detriment; Deadpool doesnt require a forceful or charismatic bad guy. Homeland and Gothams Morena Baccarin is appealing as the title characters love interest. Excitement in fan circles about Deadpool is understandable this is a different kind of movie. The only rule it adheres to is that tropes are made to be eviscerated turned on their heads and trampled over. Deadpool faces some challenges. Mid-February isnt a fertile time for superhero movies and the R-rating will keep a core element of the comic book audience away (at least officially). But this is a hugely entertaining motion picture strong word-of-mouth should make it one of 2016s early winners.

These snappy sometimes silly credits all play over a slick gory slow-motion car crash that hints at major carnage to come all with a cheeky twist (amid the swirling crunched bodies gentling hurdling through space there is various self-aware ephemera like a People Magazine declaring Ryan Reynolds as the sexiest man alive and a Green Lantern card that made an entire audience groan). Its all bolstered by a purposely ironic musical choice Juice Newtons ""Angel of the Morning"" blares out like the cherry on top of a ""look isnt this funny?"" sundae. And for a moment it is but not for long. Although Deadpool has previously shown up in other features -- Reynolds himself played him in ""X-Men Origins Wolverine"" -- Millers film functions as an origin story (see? already not so original). In his non-mutant form Deadpool is Wade Wilson a former Special Forces dude turned for-hire mercenary one armed with both serious ass-kicking skills and a salty sense of humor (hes not called ""the merc with the mouth"" for nothing). Wade mostly busies himself with beating up baddies for chump change and hanging out at a local merc watering hole run by his pal Weasel (TJ Miller providing standard comic relief in a movie already bent on being funny). Things change for Wade when he meets the alluring Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) whos also both very violent and funny. The pair fall in love and everything looks like sunshine and roses until Wade is diagnosed with cancer. Eventually driven to find a cure he submits to the weirdo come-ons of a mystery man who delivers him to Ajaxs (Ed Skrein) ""workshop"" to be presumably made better. Hes not. Deadpool for all of his wit and winking self-awareness is still bred from the X-Men line and Ajaxs ""treatment"" involves subjecting Wade to enough stress pain and torture that his mutant genes activate and cure him. When those genes do finally pop up they turn Wade into a mutant capable of healing himself from everything not just cancer though his outward appearance is forever altered (and not for the better). In a rage he destroys the workshop and sets his crosshairs on Ajax the only man who may be able to change him back. Horrified by his appearance Wade becomes Deadpool slinks into the shadows and refuses to let Vanessa in on his new lifestyle until he can force Ajax to fix him. Its a fine enough plan and its one punctuated by plenty of style a solid self-awareness (and lots of fourth wall breaking) some pretty good jokes and the thorny realization that it will never pan out. Also two of the X-Men show up begging Deadpool to join their merry leagues. Its a bit of a mess but even with its piled-on plot and lots of laughs it still looks very much like a standard superhero origin film. Even casual comic book movie fans are likely well aware of the years-long struggle to bring ""Deadpool"" to the big screen as a standalone film (the film is like the X-Men franchise not part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe but Deadpool is a Marvel superhero and the film was partially produced by Marvel Entertainment alongside 20th Century Fox) a complicated drama of inner-studio wrangling and competing interests that while a fine enough talking point for a while there holds little bearing on the final film itself. What is clear however is how much Reynolds and company clearly wanted to make this film particularly for fans and that good cheer and strong dedication shines through in every frame. Reynolds is at his best here as Deadpool (and alternately as Wade) all snappy jokes and sly one-liners. Hes genuinely fun (hes funny too sure but really hes fun) and he seems to relish the chance to give his chimichanga-loving hero the main stage that many people have so long desired. In a landscape where superhero roles are too often seen as paycheck parts Reynolds breaks the mold. Too bad his film doesnt. One of the primary selling points of ""Deadpool"" and its big differences with most studio fare is its R-rating earned for ""strong violence and language throughout sexual content and graphic nudity"" (plenty of people have tried to tout the film as the ""first"" superhero film to pick up an R but thats just not the case as it follows in the rating steps of other offerings as diverse as the ""Blade"" films ""Watchmen"" and even the recent hit ""Kingsman The Secret Service""). Despite what that rating might tell you the majority of the films more adult-skewing elements lean towards the ""strong violence"" side of the scale and every action scene is punctuated by the kind of bone-crunching violence that wouldnt be out of place in the ""Saw"" franchise. At one point Deadpool wryly remarks that the film is really a horror movie and while that particularly instance is caught up in psychological trauma its hard not to see the parallels elsewhere. As is often the case with such violence it eventually becomes numbing. By its midpoint once the novelty of a superhero movie showing super levels of violence wears off the thinness and lack of spark in the fight scenes becomes more readily apparent. By the films end they are hard to distinguish from any other superhero fare. Similarly lack of imagination keep the films prodigious swearing and occasional nudity from feeling like anything original. They appear to be shoe-horned into the film simply because they could be not because they serve an essential purpose. And here we thought ""Deadpool"" would do something different. Grade B- ""Deadpool"" opens nationwide on February 12.

If you like Deadpool you probably were that little jackhole I overheard coming out of Snakes on a Plane saying it was the ""best movie Ive ever seen."" Reply Mary May 12 2016 1146 am ""Similarly lack of imagination keep the films prodigious swearing and occasional nudity from feeling like anything original."" - I completely agree. Especially in regards to the nudity. I have never been bothered by nudity in film when it serves a function but there were moments when it was obvious that the filmmaker was just throwing in a vagina or boobs for no reason other than he could. I say he because even without knowing up front - it was obviously a man. All of the characters outside of Deadpool were incredibly underdeveloped. As someone with no prior knowledge of the comic series I developed no empathy with anyone in the film. Sure it was entertaining but I wouldnt want to see it again.

Guys if its a crappy film you dont need a PhD in Deadpoolism to see its crap. Same if its a good movie. Besides the majority of moviegoers wont know anything about the comics and judge the film on its own which makes the point even mooter.

Also this film looks like Ace Ventura Super Douche Ryan Reynolds has built his entire career off pretending hes brodie in Mallrats and now hes thrown some jim carrey in there its unbearable Reply RRA May 12 2016 1146 am Marvel Studios has built up such brand power that people mistakenly think EVERY movie based off a Marvel comic is produced by them.

"Review The Deadpool mutant gets off to a fun start but eventually wears out his welcome - LA Times COMPANY TOWN ENTERTAINMENT ENVELOPE COMPANY TOWN Review Ryan Reynolds Deadpool mutant gets off to a fun start but eventually wears out his welcome Deadpool Joe Lederer / Twentieth Century Fox A scene from the film ""Deadpool."" A scene from the film ""Deadpool."" (Joe Lederer / Twentieth Century Fox) Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter ""Deadpool"" the latest Marvel creation to get his own major motion picture is very much like a character you might encounter at a party or sit next to on a plane. But not necessarily in a good way.At first it all seems promising. Energetically played by Ryan Reynolds Deadpool may be a mutant but he has no use for his goody-two-shoes X-Men colleagues. A sharp sarcastic torrent of profane comic energy hes an unapologetic breaker of fourth walls who cracks wise to the audience and proclaims ""I may be super but Im no hero."" Whats not to like? See more of Entertainments top stories on Facebook gt;gt;Youre initially jazzed by his effrontery but Deadpool with his relentlessly glib nothing-sacred attitude is not an individual who wears particularly well. Despite everyones good intentions watching him in action makes you feel like Mickey Mouse in ""The Sorcerers Apprentice"" desperate for the off switch that is not there. And even though having a Marvel character who curses energetically and engages in vivid sex initially seems refreshingly different this films iconoclasm is all on the surface a plausible disguise for a movie trying to pretend to be something its not.

Every superheros story has its pivotal then-everything-changed moment a radioactive spider bite a laboratory experiment gone awry exposure to cosmic rays. This one involves an Internet leak. In late July 2014 nearly two minutes of old test footage from an offbeat and very R-rated movie called... (Josh Rottenberg) For though this is the rare Marvel film that is rated R ""Deadpool"" is also rife with standard-issue elements like a massive action set piece ending the mandatory Stan Lee cameo and a central plot question -- will love conquer all? -- thats as square as Captain America.As written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick and directed by Tim Miller in his debut ""Deadpool"" packs a lot of its originality visually and verbally into an opening sequence that could easily be seen more than once.Instead of the conventional opening credits Reese and Wernick come up with a stream of tongue-in-cheek items with on-screen type bombastically proclaiming ""directed by an overpaid tool"" and ""written by the real heroes here."" Placed underneath the type by Miller (who has a background in commercials games and visual effects) is a chaotic action moment pulled out of the middle of the film and presented in super-slow motion slow enough for us to see among other things a tongue-in-cheek visual reference to Reynolds previous comic-book incarnation as the unfortunate Green Lantern. Deadpool movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews Deadpool starring Ryan Reynolds Morena Baccarin and T. J. Miller. Video by Jason H. Neubert Kenneth Turan reviews Deadpool starring Ryan Reynolds Morena Baccarin and T. J. Miller. Video by Jason H. Neubert See more videos Reynolds is on much firmer ground here as the antihero Deadpool someone who calls a poundage-challenged bearded biker ""fat Gandalf"" jokes about the sexual habits of Wolverine and says of himself ""I want to live to 102 and die. Like the city of Detroit.""This act does as noted eventually get wearing but Reynolds is quite good at it. So much so that as screenwriter Reese explains in the media notes if the actor said of a line ""I dont think that sounds like Deadpool"" the writers would take it as gospel.Though the filmmakers have broken up ""Deadpools"" narrative in a complicated way taking us back and forth between the past and the present at its core this is one of those Marvel origins stories. So eventually we work our way to two years before the events in the opening montage before the mutant known as Deadpool existed and Wade Wilson was making his way in the world.A former Special Forces operative credited with 41 confirmed kills Wilson as a civilian passes the time as a mercenary working out of a bar called Sister Margarets Home for Wayward Girls an enforcer who sees himself as ""a bad guy who gets to ... worse guys."" See the most-read entertainment stories gt;gt;Open link Quite literally a wayward girl is hooker Vanessa Carlysle (Morena Baccarin). The two meet cute go on a date centered on Skeeball and sex and are as happy as two good-looking movie stars can be until tragedy in the form of a terrible illness strikes.That puts Wilson in the hands of the evil sadistic Ajax (Ed Skrein) who runs the unsavory WeaponX workshop that aims to create mutants by torturing them until the mutant genes that may be lurking in their DNA appear an unpleasant experience for the audience as well as the hero.The result is Deadpool a mutant with speeded-up healing powers but also a man whose entire body including his face has been scarred by the experience. (Though the disfiguring is referred to as ""the stuff of nightmares"" in movie terms not surprisingly it is fairly easy to take.)Still unwilling to show himself to Vanessa Deadpool goes on a violent rampage to find and punish Ajax and his colleague Angel Dust (MMA fighter Gina Carano). This attracts the attention of fellow mutants Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) and the computer-generated Colossus who also get into the act.Despite all these macho heroics ""Deadpools"" romantic element turns out to be one of its most affecting. Special mention should go to Baccarin who seems to specialize in difficult relationships. (She played Nicholas Brodys wife in ""Homeland."") Her work helps us invest in these proceedings more than one would have thought possible.ALSO Deadpools comic relief T.J.

Nothing is sacred including the opening credits which refer to the films creative team as ""tools"" and ""asshats"" and name-check Reynolds as Peoples Sexiest Man Alive. Screenwriters  Rhett Rheese and Paul Wernick turn the comic created by Rob Liefeld and Fabian Nicieza into their personal playing field for R-rated dirty talk and viscera-ripping violence. The PG-13 timidity of so many Marvel movies has made some of us hungry to see depraved crazies at the controls. Now weve got them. Deadpool has no off-switch. This dude keeps cracking wise even when hes plotting vengeance against Ajax (Ed Skrein) the villain who made his face look like corn-beef hash. Thats one of the reasons Deadpool wears a mask and keeps away from Vanessa (Homelands Morena Baccarin) a strip-joint hooker to whom he has pledged his heart. Believe it or not Baccarin and Reynolds make you care about this hot couple from hell. And T.J. Miller gets in his licks as Deadpools bartender buddy from his Wade days. Newbie director Tim Miller keeps the action coming in gory chunks mixing in appearances from bad-girl Angel Dust (Gina Carano) and two X-Men -- Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand). Deadpool keeps ripping the studio for cheapness since it only provided two X-Men but provides a nasty Wolverine impression you wont want to miss. I gotta tell you this movies junky feel is part of its charm. Sure it goes on too long and repetition dulls its initial cleverness. Still Deadpool is party time for action junkies and Reynolds may just have found the role that makes his career.

One reason it snared me was that its hero is when you come down to it a snotty film critic a albeit with less flab than the real thing. 372 Shares Share 345 Tweet 19 Share 7 Share Email Print Share Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) is armed and ready for battle (and his next quip). Photo Joe Lederer/Marvel/Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation. The Marvel Universe -- made up of multiple galaxies among them Disneys Marvel Cinematic Universe (including the Avengers et al and the Netflix heroes) and Foxs Marvel properties (the X-Men family of characters the Fantastic Four) -- represents the most powerful entertainment entity in history apart from maybe the Roman Empires gladiator franchise. But every time pretentious critics like moi gear up to rail against the way it has gobbled up Hollywoods resources along comes a disarming new variant on the standard superhero say Marvels Jessica Jones the grown-up female-centric Netflix emo-noir with Krysten Ritter; or now Deadpool the agreeable unprecedentedly R-rated romp with in-jokes dirty words and splatter. Related Stories The Deadpool Moment The Secret History of Marvelas Boom Brand Deadpool and the Promising Rise of Heteroflexibility in Comedies Directed by first-timer Tim Miller Deadpool is a send-up of Marvel movies but in no way a takedown of them. Its not subversive -- its meant to elasticize and enhance the superhero genre to flatter the audience for being hip enough to get all of those in-jokes. And I was flattered. A line that hinges on actors in another Marvel series had me cracking up for an entire minute wagging my head and smiling and cracking up again. The screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick had anticipated my own response and beat me to it by maybe a tenth of a second. They know what we know. The title character -- born Wade Winston Wilson -- appeared as a villain in the early 90s before evolving into a rude fast-talking antihero. I hadnt been familiar with him before this but superhero-comic non-readers have come to realize that Marvel has a hell of a lot of characters and I imagine well get to know every last one of them in the coming decade. In Deadpool hes played by Ryan Reynolds whom fanboys will recognize (likely with horror) as the star of the dim film adaptation of DCs Green Lantern. Those screenwriters are way ahead of them delivering Lantern barbs from the get-go. They also make fun of Reynoldss acting. They even have Wade question his own stature turning to the camera -- hes known for breaking the fourth wall -- to ask why he deserves his own movie. The structure is gratifyingly twisty. In the course of the first bloody battle (heavy on wisecracks and brain matter) the action pauses for flashbacks to Deadpools ""origin story."" We learn that hes ex-military; that he did nasty things for money though only against nastier people; and that he fell in love with a smoking-hot prostitute named Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) with whom he canoodles in a month-by-month montage set to Neil Sedakas ""Calendar Girl."" Baccarin who has appeared in several superhero vehicles and was Brodys often-topless wife in the early seasons of Homeland disrobes a lot but Wade assures us that shes not just another sex object peddled by Hollywood. We laugh knowingly. A surge of calamities the last at the hand of the British bad guy Ajax (Ed Skrein) leaves Wade so mutilated that a stretchy blue Spider-Man-like costume is the best way to appear in public. But Ajax -- a mutant in the X-Men mode -- is also responsible for bringing Wades own dormant mutant powers to the surface. After several face-offs with Ajax as well as a vigorous disagreement with a pair of lesser-known X-Men -- a computer-generated Russian-accented steel colossus called aptly Colossus (voiced by Stefan Kapicic) and a punk girl called Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) -- Wade must rescue Vanessa and force Ajax to give him his old face back. In some ways Deadpool resembles the old Hope and Crosby Road pictures with one obvious exception The action is relatively serious. Actually more than serious Its lavishly gratuitously gory with a gleeful kick; and at one point the hero is tortured so cruelly for so long I had to look away. In his typical eyes-on-us way Wade says something along the lines of ""This is where it becomes a horror movie"" -- which makes Deadpool a have-your-torture-porn-and-make-fun-of-it-too film. The movie has no theme no subtext and no villains of stature although its always nice to see Gina Carano (as Ajaxs vicious sidekick Angel Dust) throw people across the screen. What saves it are the jokes. I estimate that 50 percent of them hit home another 30 whiz by inoffensively and only 20 percent are genuine stinkers -- a hell of a good percentage given the sheer number of one-liners. And Reynolds knows how to skip along the surface of the role but when he needs to bring out the big dramatic guns. Hes an underrated actor -- although with luck not after this film. I feel a bit like a shill for recommending Deadpool. One reason it snared me was that its hero is when you come down to it a snotty film critic -- albeit with less flab than the real thing. The movie is reminiscent of the web series Honest Trailers which uses a films own selling points to lampoon it. Its so on the wavelength of the current mainstream audience that you might find yourself thinking This is Marvels universe and were just renting space in it.

Courtesy of 21st Century Fox hide caption toggle caption Courtesy of 21st Century Fox Its sort of a relief to report that Ryan Reynolds is finally coming into his own superhero-wise in Deadpool. Courtesy of 21st Century Fox Marvels new superhero movie Deadpool stars Ryan Reynolds a fact that up to now would likely not have been considered much of a selling point. This is not after all Reynolds first stint as a superhero. There was that catastrophic Green Lantern movie his animated supersnail in Turbo and he played this character very briefly in whats arguably the least of the X-Men movies. So its sort of a relief to be able to report that Reynolds is finally coming into his own in Deadpool which has the singular virtue of being funnier than weve been led to believe a superhero film can be. Its also violent to point of sadism explicit both visually and in terms of language. A potty-mouthed splatterfest in fact -- but a funny one. In short its not for kids though its hard to imagine the 14-year-old who wont be trying to sneak in this weekend. Marvel has perfected the superhero screenplay for the PG-13 crowd. Here the brand is venturing deep into R territory pretty much from the opening credits where the camera zips through one of those frozen-bullet slow-motion car crashes as cheeky generics stand in for names. Featured actors include ""Hot Chick"" ""Some Idiot"" ""Moody Teen"" and ""British Villain."" The director is listed as ""Overpaid Tool"" and theres one really good joke screenplay written by ""The Real Heroes Here."" And the fourth-wall-breaking doesnt stop with the credits. ""Shes gonna do a superhero landing wait for it"" Deadpool says grinning as an opponent leaps from on high into a crouch. ""Really hard on your knees"" he adds. ""Totally impractical. They all do it."" The plot centers on a good guy whos also a bad guy -- special forces op turned mercenary Wade Wilson played by Ryan Reynolds who undergoes a rogue medical procedure that gives him superfast healing powers but also leaves him looking -- in one of the kinder phrases best-bud T.J. Miller offers -- ""like a testicle with teeth."" The rest -- in more or less typical though R-rated superhero fashion -- is our wisecracking antihero exacting revenge on Ajax (Ed Skrein) the snarling sadist who did this to him while rescuing girlfriend Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) who asserts repeatedly that damsel in distress is not a comfortable role for her though she is eventually reduced to one. Have we been here before? Well yeah though mostly in pieces. Deadpools deadpan owes a little something to Robert Downey Jr.s Iron Man; the over-the-top violence weve seen in Kill Bill and Watchmen. The deconstructing-the-superhero thing was done in Kick-Ass. Even that frozen-bullet-zipping-around thing director Tim Miller keeps returning to has been done recently in an X-Men flick. Oh I shouldve mentioned there are a couple of X-persons here too -- Deadpools buddy Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) who gets his chromed head handed to him and a youngster who fully lives up to her name Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand). Miller who is directing his very first feature here after mostly serving up visual effects and animated credit sequences elsewhere (including the spectacular credits to The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo) seems to be having plenty of fun mixing the clatter with patter and splatter as his writers keep the self-referential Hollywood references coming -- to Reynolds ""Sexiest Man Alive"" People magazine cover to Liam Neesons Taken movies to how a buxom Bernadette Peters fueled the 14-year-old Wade Wilsons fantasies. All of which is designed to make Deadpool appeal to the cynical rebellious 14-year-old in everyone. Whether you want to unleash that 14-year-old? ... thats up to you.

Photo Joe Lederer/Twentieth Century Fox MOVIE REVIEW Deadpool Running time 108 minutes. Rated R (profanity crude humor graphic violence drug references sex nudity). Now playing. ""Deadpool"" is the story of a guy everybody wrote off for dead who returns looking much worse than the last time anyone saw him. Welcome back Ryan Reynolds. When did you turn 60? This one is a ""different kind of superhero movie"" meaning even more fiercely attached to the mode of artistic expression known as ""puberty."" Ex-soldier Wade Wilson (Reynolds) is facing terminal cancer when a mysterious stranger invites him to try a bold new therapy that will give him superpowers. Tricked Wade emerges from a chamber of horrors as a mutant who is as unkillable as ""Greys Anatomy."" He chooses a red suit because that hides the blood becomes roomies with an old blind woman (Leslie Uggams) with a cocaine fixation and sets out on a mission of unholy vengeance against his tormentor Ajax a k a Francis (Ed Skrein) who captures his girlfriend (Morena Baccarin). The movie establishes its sense of humor in the fake opening credits (""a film by some douchebag"" starring ""Gods perfect idiot"" and written by ""the real heroes here""). Its assumed that youll be heaving with laughs by now because all of Deadpools dialogue is along the same lines. Deadpool is constantly addressing himself to the camera (even sticking a wad of gum on it) commenting on superhero motifs bragging about his ass-kicking skills and talking sweetly to his lady love ""Your right leg is Thanksgiving your left leg is Christmas Can I visit you between the holidays?"" He swears like swearing has just been invented which is to say he comes to us from Planet Eighth Grade. Reynolds with co-star Morena BaccarinPhoto Twentieth Century Fox As in eighth grade ""Deadpool"" directed by first-timer Tim Miller and written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick assumes that the following things are automatically funny and should be mentioned as frequently as possible to achieve maximum comedy Things being stuck up the butt (Reynolds sphincter should have gotten its own credit) masturbation calling a dude ""d - - kless"" groin punches . . . there are more differences among Adam Sandler movies than there are among these jokes. In a romantic moment girl tells disfigured guy ""Its a face Id be happy to sit on."" I laughed zero times but I can see how fans of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and ""Kingsman"" will hail ""Deadpool"" as genius. Doesnt it subvert convention? Doesnt it slyly comment on itself such as when Deadpool remarks ""Fourth-wall break inside a fourth-wall break -- thats like 16 walls"" Yes and there arent many superhero movies that exploit the liberating effects of the hard-R rating. But to me the mock opening credits are the only detail that is fresh -- sophomoric but fresh. As for the endless self-referential quality superhero movies have been digging their elbows into our ribs for many years since long before George Clooneys Batman said ""This is why Superman works alone."" Maybe we all would have thought that one was brilliant if only the Caped Crusader had said ""f - - k Aquaman"" and joked about the bullet that went up his butt.

"Deadpool lets Ryan Reynolds bring back his smirk review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesDeadpool lets Ryan Reynolds bring back his smirk reviewRyan Reynolds has found his smirk again with the superhero send-up Deadpool -- and it hasnt come a moment too soon for an actor almost sunk by the Green Lantern debacle.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Feb. 11 2016DeadpoolStarring Ryan Reynolds. Morena Baccarin Ed Skrein T.J. Miller and Gina Carano. Directed by Tim Miller. Opens Friday at GTA theatres. 108 minutes. 18ARyan Reynolds has found his smirk again -- and not a moment too soon.Superhero send-up Deadpool restores and fully exploits the Canadian-born actors gift for smartass banter something hes seemed afraid to utilize in recent years as hes struggled to prove himself as a deadly serious thespian.Article Continued BelowThe debacle of Green Lantern a mirthless DC Comics saga that fit him like concrete Spandex evidently flashed upon Reynolds the realization that he has nothing to lose and a lot to gain just by being himself.Ryan Reynolds is Marvel Comics Deadpool.  (Joe Lederer/Twentieth Fox)  Thats perfect for Tim Millers Deadpool a rudely hilarious Marvel X-Men offshoot where Reynolds mighty mutant title character is anything but a conventional superdude even before he acquires his extreme skills red-hooded cosplay costume and scarred face and mind. The sneering bad attitude was already there in Deadpools previous human guise as Wade Wilson a Special Forces soldier turned mercenary thug ""Im just a bad guy who gets paid to f--- up worse guys"" he announces.Serious love and terminal cancer knock this cock off his walk. He falls for comely call girl Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) who returns the woo but the big ""C"" arrives just after Cupid and its arrows are fatal.Wade becomes uncharacteristically sullen despite the support of Vanessa and sardonic buck-ups from his bartender BFF Weasel (T.J. Miller). Only a miracle will save Wade and in true Marvel fashion it arrives through an experimental weaponizing treatment from a dodgy doc named Ajax (Ed Skrein doing his best Blighty baddie) who is aided by sullen strongwoman Angel Dust (Gina Carano).The operation cures cancer and bestows infinite speed and strength but its a bust as a facial treatment. Wade emerges looking like 180 lbs. of bad meat seeking to hide from Vanessa and planning revenge on Ajax. His sarcastic wit remains intact however and in his new guise as the blank-eyed and sharpshooting Deadpool hes also taking aim at Marvels fat rump. The fourth wall is frequently broken and so are churchgoer standards -- the film has a rare ""R"" rating stateside 18A in Ontario -- as the scarlet revenger sets out to radically up both the body and laugh count.The cynical yuks begin with the opening credits -- the producers are called ""some asshats"" -- and continue throughout a film that makes merry about its tiny budget which includes messing about with ""C""-grade X-Men castoffs Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand). Much of the film looks as if it was shot on the same Vancouver backlot construction site which it was.Not that we should care about such details because Deadpool certainly doesnt. Hes just out for vengeance some kinky thrills and a love to embrace his face. Such modest ambition is a tonic in a world lousy with superbores. Who are we to deny the guy especially on Valentines Day weekend?Correction- Feb. 12 2016 This article was edited from a previous version that mistakenly said the Green Lantern is a Marvel Comics character. In fact the Green Lantern is a DC Comics saga.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

There are parts of it I loathe down to the core of my being. More about Deadpool >> And then there are parts that evoke both reactions simultaneously. Those hurt the most. Director Tim Millers freshman outing which is sure to be a mega blockbuster features a career-making performance by Reynolds as Wade Wilson a special-forces soldier turned low-end mercenary who finds out he has terminal cancer - like all over the joint. His luck seems to turn when a charming British knave (Ed Skrein) recruits him to take part in an experimental treatment that will turn him into a superhero. His cancer would of course be cured in the process. The Brit seems to be so ashamed of his given name Francis that he goes by Ajax. He turns out to be really really evil. Ajax and his henchperson Angel Dust (MMA champ Gina Carano) use their weird science to ruin Wades skin - the poor guys crater-riven face looks like a combination of the dark side of the moon and a sausage pizza. Wade and Ajax wage battle. Even though his body now regenerates rapidly Wade loses. Wade rebrands himself a superhero named Deadpool. Then some other stuff happens. Then at the end of the third act Ajax and Deadpool battle again. Theres also a love story. Ill get to that. Reynolds channels Jim Carrey and the late great hypermanic Robin Williams as Deadpool. Hes a wiseacre with a really big motormouth who cant stop talking - he narrates his story explains his motivation and otherwise addresses the audience directly. Its tres Pirandello. The dude cant help making crass sexually loaded comments drop obscene jokes or pass wind in a loud and ostentatious manner. Even though he had me in stitches for considerable stretches of time Reynolds takes it too far. The whole movie pushes the joke to near breaking point. Beginning with the opening credits - the stars and filmmakers names are replaced with dirty puns - were subjected to a really low-down cheap brand of humor. Reynolds and his costars - including T.J. Miller who plays Deadpools BFF Weasel and Leslie Uggams as the mercenarys roommate a blind elderly woman - discourse in the kind of dirty babble youd expect from 16-year-old stoners. Theres nothing less sexy than Beavis and Butthead jabber so it comes as a shock when Reynolds steps up rather than suppressing his puerile banter when his character meets the storys love interest Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) a former escort with a body to die for who happens to have the same mega-geeky comic-book tastes as Wade. The films major conflicts make sense only in the context of Wades all-consuming Id-rather-die-than-lose-her passion for Vanessa. But their courtship feels more like a bull session between a couple of newly arrived college freshmen who share ultra-earnest tidbits about the meaning of life while sharing a crusty bong. Wade and Vanessa have a lot of hot sex of course but its tempered by this childish creepiness. The duo act as if they are playing at being in love and not actually in that glorious state.

Comments click to enlarge Deadpool The IMAX Experience Recommended Video Rated R  104 minutes  2016 Ryan Reynolds vanquishes the ghost of his failed Green Lantern franchise and reclaims his squandered villain role from Wolverine (2013) as the titular antihero in this raunchy Marvel action flick. As directed by Tim Miller (Scott Pilgrim vs. The World) the story of a mercenary transformed into a fast-healing superhuman runs on snide comedy with a nice romance some drama and hardcore action sequences thrown in for good measure. The film is packed with in-jokes (it has more pop culture references than the average Gilmore Girls episode) and gratuitous gore which is almost always played for laughs. Fans of X-Men will gobble it up especially lewd teenage boys; newcomers to the Marvel Universe may miss some of the best zingers. With Morena Baccarin Ed Skrein and T.J. Miller.

Almost.  | 1/2 out of 4 stars By Colin Covert Star Tribune February 11 2016 -- 312pm Universal Pictures Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) reacts to the threats of Colossus (voiced by Stefan Kapicic). Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Gory sarcastic obnoxious profane frequently nude and more than a touch sexist the hard-R-rated ""Deadpool"" is the movie every 15-year-old hard-core Marvel fanboy has been holding his breath for. The genre-subverting film is more an audacious spinoff than a new addition to the current crop of comic-based action adventures. It gives us Ryan Reynolds as a cynical wisecracking ultraviolent antihero (if hes any variety of hero at all). ""Zombieland"" writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick explain his obligatory back story through a series of broken fourth walls. They have their main character speak directly to the audience when hes not insulting everyone within the aggressive sound of his voice. Reynolds plays special ops veteran Wade Wilson a thug with a heart of gold -- well brass -- who earns beer money by slapping around bros who stalk young honeys. When he is tortured into a disfigured mutant by a villainous scientist (Ed Skrein) aiming to sell him as a superservant he costumes up adopts the nickname Deadpool and sets out to get even. His payback scheme begins in the pre-credits opening sequence a bravura battle sequence by first-time director Tim Miller. His background in video games gives him impressive visual chops. Deadpool triggers a multicar highway smashup shoots a posse of his evil doctors henchmen to bloody smithereens gives them a slice-and-dice with his samurai cutlery set and soccer-kicks one severed head into another still functioning. And thats before the movie even begins. Its a good introduction to the main character who later steers a Zamboni across an ice rink to snail-pace its way over a fallen enemy. 20th Century Fox Ryan Reynolds is ""Deadpool."" ""Deadpool"" carries the 20th Century Fox sector of Marvels cinematic universe well above the fantastic flop of last summers ""Fantastic Four."" Its much more enjoyable than the studios 2009 prequel ""X-Men Origins Wolverine"" where Reynolds first played the role of the serial-killing swordsman less wisecracking there because his lips were sewn shut. Is the long awaited follow-up a triumphant return for the motormouth mercenary? No considering the long gestation period. Is it a hoot? Largely yeah if you like smug dumb in-your-face humor. And if youre the kind of viewer who enters nirvana through a path of Easter eggs in-jokes meta-gags and pop-culture one-liners your prayers are answered. The script throws abuse at Hugh Jackman Reynolds dreadful work in ""Green Lantern"" James McAvoy and Patrick Stewart Wham Salt-N-Pepa and even Marvel founder Stan Lee who is cast as the DJ in a seedy strip club. In a visit to X-Men headquarters Reynolds gripes that his sidekicks are only a CGI-animated figure of the gentle steel giant Colossus and his bratty trainee Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) because the film couldnt afford name talent from the franchise. But the rapid-fire punchlines dont last forever. With forced downshifts the story drops speed for sizable passages of serious romance and illness-related grief involving Deadpools skanky but sweet girlfriend Vanessa (Morena Baccarin). As Deadpool observes in his opening monologue there are women who were pulled into the theater on dates and that demographic needs attention too. Baccarins funniest moments come from her ability to quote ""Star Wars"" with the level of scholarship that fan-dudes dream about. Bringing the story back up to ultra-goofy speed requires a lot of gear-grinding and accelerator stomping. As wicked as it is ""Deadpool"" lacks the genre-sendup style of Matthew Vaughns ""Kick Ass"" and ""Kingsmen."" Its not at the level of Reese and Wernicks ""Zombieland."" Its not in the same league as the ""21 Jump Street"" movies. But without a doubt its the best Marvel movie until the next Marvel movie.

Review Ryan Reynolds is a riot in Deadpool By Calvin Wilson St. Louis Post-Dispatch Calvin Wilson Feb 11 2016 (...) Joe Lederer This image released by Twentieth Century Fox shows Ryan Reyonlds in a scene from ""Deadpool."" (Joe Lederer/Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. via AP) Joe Lederer Perhaps only the animated Dash from ""The Incredibles"" possesses a faster and looser superhero-comic approach than Reynoldss flesh-and-bloodstained mutant mercenary in Marvels ""Deadpool."" The snark-happy ""Merc With a Mouth"" quips as quick as the semi-animated Jim Carrey in ""The Mask"" firing off rounds of punch lines like ammo. He nimbly bends to the needs of the script which relies massively on his fleet comic brio. Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) isnt afraid of a fight. In fact he relishes the prospect of busting heads -- or worse. And fortunately for him the world is full of bad guys. Its just a matter of deciding who to take on.A prime candidate is Ajax (Ed Skrein) the mad scientist responsible for transforming Deadpool from a head-turning hunk into a guy forced to hide his disfigured visage behind a mask.Before his fateful encounter with Ajax Deadpool was Wade Wilson a cynical but likable mercenary whod found his soul mate in a cynical but likable prostitute named Vanessa (Morena Baccarin). But their romance hit a roadblock when Wilson received news that spun his life in a whole new direction -- leading him to make a decision that had unforeseen but irrevocable consequences. Or is that a bit too vague?Dont worry. You wont have any trouble keeping up to speed because Deadpool speaks directly to the audience -- when hes not causing mayhem.Despite his insistence that hes nobodys idea of a hero he still has the option to assume that role. Or he can continue on his murderous path. What would life be without choices? Based on the unconventional Marvel Comics character ""Deadpool"" is something different in superhero flicks a self-aware sendup that works overtime to be as rude and irreverent as possible. Naysayers may dismiss the whole enterprise as irredeemably juvenile but that would be their loss. Once you get past its over-the-top violence this is one of the funniest films of the year.Working from a screenplay by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick director Tim Miller keeps the laughs coming while hinting at the darkness underneath. But the film wouldnt work without the comic talents of Reynolds who played a watered-down version of Deadpool in ""X-Men Origins Wolverine"" (2009). And Baccarin whos best known for her work in television (""Homeland"") makes the most of her cliched character.Smart sexy and outrageous ""Deadpool"" delivers.What ""Deadpool""  31/2 stars out of four  Run time 147  Rating R  Content Violence language sexual content nudity Calvin Wilson  314-340-8346calvinwilsonstl on Twittercalvinwilsonpost-dispatch.com Tags Deadpool Calvin Wilson Calvin Wilson Calvin Wilson is an arts writer for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

That is to say it starts out story-wise with a messed up mercenary named Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) except he mostly just jokes about being messed up and hes not really that mercenary. (He donates his earnings to charity) Wade has the good fortune to meet a gal whose brand of crazy ""matches"" his -- a maniac pixie dream girl -- only to discover that hes dying of cancer. Cue the experimental lab that both cures him and makes him superhuman but has an ugly side effect it makes him ugly. So of course he sets out on a murderous rampage in pursuit of the man who can make him handsome again because otherwise his true love and soul mate wont want him any more. When you play that stupid you need to commit -- say by having the hot chick (as she is identified in the chuckleworthy opening credits) actually be that shallow. Not that any of this matters overmuch because the story is less important here than the star and even the star is less important than the barrage of one-liners and violent visual gags. There are lots; about half of them work. The half that dont will either not matter or leave you exhausted depending.

With Britton Peele Share This Story Share Discuss Meh Without Deadpool the character Deadpool the film would be derivative uneventful and possibly even boring despite how much blood is brutally spilled.But calling Deadpool ""just another comic book movie"" would do injustice to a film that makes a strong effort to deliver something different.Mercenary Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) is a loose cannon and a particular brand of crazy but he also has a heart -- somewhere deep deep down. So when a cancer diagnoses threatens his blossoming relationship with Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) hes willing to go to great lengths to find a cure ... only to discover that the ""cure"" was more of a curse making him practically immortal but ugly under his mask.Youve probably seen that story before right? A boy with rough edges meets a girl with rough edges they fall in love their relationship is threatened boy obtains a lot of power and goes on a murderous rampage for revenge (or a twisted sense of ""justice""). Whether the boy has super powers or not you can make good assumptions about how the end game plays out.But Deadpool manages to work because its title character acknowledges all of this and does his best to make it entertaining anyway. Marvel Comics ""merc with a mouth"" is unique in the extent to which he breaks the fourth wall just about any time hes on the page (or now on screen). Deadpool knows youre in the audience watching a movie and he doesnt want you to take it too seriously. The entire film plays with this concept joyfully. The opening credits dont contain a single real name for any of the cast and crew. It is ""Some douchebags film"" starring ""a hot chick."" During those same credits is a clear jab at Reynolds and comic book history.At one point a character acknowledges that the main reason to talk to a mysterious man is that it ""might further the plot.""You could make the argument that a weak plot is still a weak plot whether the film acknowledges its flaws or not but Deadpool plays with expectations enough to make the ride funny throughout. Even most of the gags that arent laugh-out-loud funny are entertaining enough for a chuckle.Its also a ride thats not at all intended for the younger superhero fans out there. Deadpool is super but hes not a hero. Shortly after the movie begins Deadpool starts talking to the audience about the qualities of Wolverines (the X-Men character played by Hugh Jackman) genitals. Then he cuts off a guys head and drops a bunch of bodies on a busy intersection.Its that kind of movie. More than anything Deadpool is a vehicle for bloody action and puerile jokes. But dang it does those things pretty well. For those immersed in the larger narrative of comic book movies Deadpool does intertwine with the X-Men series -- albeit barely. Two minor mutants from the franchise make repeated appearances (as Deadpool says outright this film didnt have the budget for bigger stars) but prior knowledge of them isnt required to get the gist of whats going on. If you want another comic book movie to compare it to? Guardians of the Galaxy works. Both films are focused on being upbeat and funny over dark and serious though the sci-fi Guardians is much more appropriate for more age groups. Joe Lederer Deadpool was reportedly a passion project for everybody involved having fought off cancellation from the studio thanks to demand from fans. It shows. Reynolds looks like hes having a blast in the title role embracing everything that makes the character fun and unique.Without his energy and without the characters wit Deadpool would be dead on arrival. Instead its able to stand out among comic book movies that may have more substance but not nearly as much style. Deadpool (B) Directed by Tim Miller.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Michael OSullivan February 11 In an effort to cure his cancer Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) underwent an experiment that left him with accelerated healing powers and a twisted sense of humor. (  / 20th Century Fox) Deadpool"" is not your grandfathers superhero movie. Come to think of it it isnt your 13-year-old nephews superhero movie either. Blatantly buoyantly vulgar and jam-packed with conspicuously perverse often bloody violence -- including a scene in which the titular protagonist while handcuffed and suffering from a bullet wound in the seat of his red Spandex pants saws off his own hand with a Japanese katana -- the film has been touted as Marvels first R-rated comic-book movie. [Answering all of your pressing ""Deadpool"" questions] Thats not entirely accurate. While the wildly popular ""X-Men"" and ""Avengers"" franchises -- including ""Iron Man"" ""Thor"" and other feeder films -- have never strayed beyond PG-13 territory some Marvel adaptations occasionally have such as ""The Punisher"" and ""Blade."" ""Deadpool"" however takes itself far less seriously than either of those films (and includes a snarky little dig at ""Blade II""). Beyond that there are a jillion other quippy self-referential jokes about comics and pop culture including the silly names for Ikea furniture; David Beckhams surprisingly high-pitched voice; and a scatological allusion to Meredith Baxter. These and other zingers fly by fast and frequently. To put it in terms that ""Deadpool"" might the script reads like ""The Simpsons"" had sex with ""American Dad"" but before the censor got there. For the record its written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (""Zombieland""). Although the opening credits mention no names -- including theirs -- star Ryan Reynolds is listed as ""Gods perfect idiot""; first-time feature director Tim Miller is described as ""an overpaid tool."" The writers are referred to as ""the real heroes here."" Thats about right. The costumed mercenary Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) will have viewers -- and anyone who gets in his way -- in stitches. (Joe Lederer/Twentieth Century Fox) Based on a Marvel character introduced in 1991 ""Deadpool"" is the origin story of mercenary Wade Wilson a.k.a. Deadpool -- or as he puts it ""a bad guy who gets paid to f--- up worse guys."" After he receives a cancer diagnosis Wade (Reynolds) is cured via a treatment that leaves him physically disfigured -- hence the head-to-toe suit -- but with his own latent mutations unleashed leaving him with superhuman agility and the ability to heal rapidly. That bullet wound? Its quickly gone even as a fresh hand starts sprouting from his stump like an amputated frog leg. [At 25 Deadpools greatest power isnt what you think it is] One very funny scene features Wade stroking with his tiny baby hand the face of his blind former cocaine-addict roommate played by Leslie Uggams. Its just one of many demented asides that do nothing whatsoever to advance the plot but are essential to the films sense of cracked antisocial enjoyment. In a running gag two obscure X-Men -- the gothy Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) and the metallic hulk named Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) -- keep trying to recruit Deadpool to their crime-fighting enterprise before realizing its a lost cause. Or is it? As much of an embittered antihero as Wade is hes also hugely likable if not entirely ""good."" Thats because of Reynolds who brings to his character a charmingly sarcastic verve thats more tart than completely sour. If the actor was miscast in ""Green Lantern"" -- and the ""Deadpool"" script is certainly not the first to admit that he was lobbing several well-earned insults in the direction of that 2011 film -- hes pretty perfect here. Like Deadpool whos not afraid to kiss a guy Reynolds exudes a pansexual appeal at once hyper-masculine and ever so slightly homoerotic. Wade Wilson (Reynolds) and his girlfriend Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) in ""Deadpool."" (Joe Lederer/Twentieth Century Fox) The forward momentum of the film is fueled by Wade/Deadpools attempt to exact revenge on the man who left him deformed (Ed Skrein) and who has kidnapped Wades prostitute girlfriend (Morena Baccarin). But thats just the plot. Despite loads of eye-poppingly well-shot fight choreography ""Deadpool"" is only 10 percent action. The other 90 percent? Attitude. It has it out the wazoo to use a word that Wade never would. At one point he calls this movie a love story; at another a horror movie. (There is a lot of direct-camera address a hallmark of the character.) In truth its a voraciously self-aware comedy one that dines out on the inherent inanity of its own premise as much as it does the movies its competing with. Deadpool may not be the first Marvel character for grown-ups. But this ""merc with a mouth"" as hes known feels like the first one with real teeth. Ill wager hes got legs too. The fast-talking funny and filthy superhero ""sounds like a f------ franchise"" to use his own words. As with nearly everything else that comes out of the characters mouth its hard to argue. R.

Reynolds in his Wade Wilson incarnation falls in love with a woman (Morena Baccarin) who is almost as wild as he is. Photo Joe Lederer Associated Press Deadpool is bad enough to be the future 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Every so often a movie comes along thats so bad it seems like the future. ""Deadpool"" is one of those movies. Its a disturbing film in that all the things we might normally attribute to ineptitude -- the fractured narrative the confusing visuals the repugnant lead character -- seem intentional possibly the harbinger of a new aesthetic. Maybe it doesnt matter anymore that we know whats blowing up so long as something is blowing up and at regular intervals. Maybe it doesnt matter that were not made to dislike the characters we see getting killed so long as some violent death is depicted onscreen which is maybe all audiences want -- and all they ever secretly wanted. ""Deadpool"" is based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name created in the 1990s as a sort of postmodern superhero. Unlike other superheroes he is aware of the superhero genre and his place within it. Onscreen he seems to know that he is a fictional character or at least that he is starring in a movie. Frequently he looks directly into the camera and talks. In one scene he even moves the camera himself. These are distancing strategies and they make for a cold piece though one with the occasional laugh. The opening credits are a self-aware spoof of credits identifying the usual types found in these movies. But at the heart of the film and overarching everything is a creepy assumption all the more creepy in that it might be true Audiences will root for the most repellent of characters so long as that character is identified as the protagonist. This hasnt always been the case but it might be now. After all in this era in which half the public is going around taking and posting pictures of themselves in which self-love has broken free of all social constraint and shame and self-forgiveness is infinite perhaps every protagonist is acceptable. A protagonist onscreen is after all a kind of second self the I -- and the eye -- through which we perceive the world. And since there couldnt ever be something wrong with any of us well he must be right in every way. Thus when Deadpool announces early on that hes going to kill a bunch of people were supposed to think thats interesting and when we soon see him shooting and butchering various characters on a highway -- heads blowing off etc. -- we are either to find this entertaining or assure ourselves that he has his reasons. The reasons will come in any case. In the meantime there is all that spectacle to enjoy the quick cuts that render action scenes unintelligible and the sprays of blood that make it all worthwhile. Hes an unsavory guy this Deadpool. In flashback we meet him in his original incarnation as Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) a bullying ex-military man working as a strong-arm guy for hire muscling and intimidating people for cash. He talks fast and randomly as though wires are crossed in his brain. The movie contains a brief almost-human interlude (five or 10 minutes tops) in which Wade falls in love with a woman (Morena Baccarin) who is almost as wild as he is. They are so compatible in their combustibility that theyre practically on the verge of domesticity when fate -- that is the plot -- intervenes and takes Deadpool in a superhero direction. Its hardly an exaggeration to say that the rest of the movie is made up of scenes of Deadpool either getting tortured planning to kill somebody or actually killing somebody. It is colossally uninvolving interesting neither as filmmaking nor as story. Deadpool has an accelerated healing capacity so he cant die no matter how much we might want him to and so he cant be in peril which eliminates all suspense. Ryan Reynolds plays Deadpool with tremendous energy speaking every line as though he had 12 cups of coffee but its all in vain. Deadpool is supposed to be the funny superhero but really whats so funny about a character acknowledging that he is in a movie? Whats so clever about little references to other superhero movies? Its the easiest thing in the world. You know whats hard? A good story. A well-composed shot. ""Deadpool"" makes fun of itself when there is barely a self to make fun of. The experience is like listening to people improvising on instruments they cannot play. This is bad borderline garbage but disturbing too in that its just the kind of fake-clever awfulness that might be cinemas future. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Movie review Deadpool Article Tweet Twentieth Century Fox Ryan Reynolds stars in Deadpool Deadpool    1/2 (out of five) Director Tim Miller Cast Ryan Reynolds Leslie Uggams T.J. Miller Ed Skrein Rated R (strong violence and language throughout sexual content and graphic nudity) Running time 108 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 846am on Thursday Feb. 11 2016 Thursday Feb. 11 2016 Thursday Feb. 11 2016 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Theres so much mass-media mockery and so many pop-culture potshots in Deadpool that its tempting to watch it with Google at the ready.How many in this ultra-violent foul-mouthed fourth-wall-breaking comic-book movies young audience are going to appreciate a joke about 73-year-old country singer Ronnie Milsap? Or fully understand the wicked humor of casting 72-year-old Leslie Uggams the first black woman to host a network variety show in another groundbreaking role as a superhero sidekick?But this is both the movies strength -- some of it is hysterical and subversive -- and its drawback. Director Tim Miller in his debut feature throws so many in-jokes and outlandish juvenile nonsense at the viewer that its easy to overlook the fact that the film especially in its final third falls into formula and is not nearly as revolutionary as it pretends to be.Based on the cult Marvel character Deadpool who first appeared in comic books in the early 90s its very different from the rest of the companys cinematic universe.More anti-hero than hero Deadpool -- who has to wear a costume because of his major disfigurement -- has little desire to save the world.Instead at least in this origin story his mission is much more selfish and personal. He wants to exact revenge on the evil guy who turned him into a creature who must shield his hideousness from public view. Its The Revenant with samurai swords instead of a bear.But thats not how it starts. The handsome Wade Winston Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) is a mercenary turned low-rent superhero saving young women from being stalked by sketchy pizza-delivery boys and the like.He falls in love with prostitute Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) and they seem destined for a life of impoverished contentment.Then he gets the bad news that he has terminal cancer. It seems his only hope is a shady back-alley ""treatment"" to be performed by a guy named Ajax (Ed Skrein). The bad news his good looks are gone. The good news His cancer is gone -- and he has superpowers. Score But hes still angry about this whole looking-like-a-monster thing.This is how Wilson becomes Deadpool a mutant who falls into the orbit of the X-Men universe (Reynolds as Deadpool appeared in X-Men Origins Wolverine back in 2009.) And why he leaves Vanessa and spends much of Deadpool hunting down the guy who did this to him.The slyly uproarious Reynolds who co-produced and had wanted to make Deadpool for years plays the character with just the right amount of surly charm and smart-mouthed bro-next-door believability.And his chemistry with Baccarin has enough spark to lift it heads and mask above the usual level of romantic relationships found in movies like this.Then theres the memorable supporting cast ranging from the aforementioned Uggams as Deadpools no-nonsense sightless roommate Blind Al to T.J. Miller ( Silicon Valley) as the deadpan owner of Deadpools favorite bar/hangout.Tim Miller working from a script by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick keeps things moving quickly and shows a facility for impressive action scenes as the film careens through its relatively brief 108 minutes.The result is that Deadpool succeeds where other irreverent send-ups of the genre like Kick Ass and American Ultra failed. Definitely stay through the final credits for the final in-joke and whatever you do dont miss the opening credits either.Still Deadpool sometimes is too clever and snarky for its own good and the confluence of over-the-top mayhem do-you-kiss-your-mother-with-that-mouth trash talk and jokey cynicism cant stop this hard-R take on the generally PG-13 Marvel universe from hurtling toward predictability.By the end Deadpool feels like just another cog in the superhero blockbuster machine. Rest assured there will be a sequel if this one does well. The Marvel assembly line churns on. Cary Darling 817-390-7571 carydar Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

Maximally cheeky. Perversely potty-mouthed. Riotously funny. Insanely violent. Uneven as all get out. And fun fun fun. Deadpool is perhaps the most out-there off-the-wall hero in the Marvel Universe. He cant be killed thanks to a horrendously painful medical procedure -- lets call it torture shall we? -- that allows him to regenerate body parts and survive shootings burnings and skewerings past counting. In one scene he carries on a conversation with a knife stuck clean through his head. And he simply wont shut up. Smarty-pants remarks many marbled with pop-culture in-jokes pour forth from his mask-covered mouth in a Niagara of R-rated verbiage. Think of the picture as the superheroic redemption of Ryan Reynolds shaking free forever of the taint of 2011s ""Green Lantern."" Reynolds dons Deadpools signature red spandex suit arms up with the characters twin swords and many many firearms and noisily kills his way through acres of bad guys snarking all the way. Sample line ""Youre probably thinking This is a superhero movie but that guy in the suit just turned that other guy into a kebab. Surprise This is a different kind of superhero story."" Oh yes. He breaks the so-called fourth wall talking directly to the audience. Deadpool knows hes a character in a movie and delights in it. The picture is a little too in on its own jokiness and it really goes overboard with a queasy-making early torture scene. Its kind of like one of those monster mousse cake desserts you find at franchise restaurants a slab the size of an Alp loaded with layers of chocolate and whipped cream. You know its too too much. You know its bad for you. You know you shouldnt enjoy it so much. Except you cant help yourself. Its a tasty guilty treat.

Its profane and violent in the extreme but also really funny and self-referential.Ryan Reynolds is Marvel Comics most unconventional anti-hero ""Deadpool.""(Photo Twentieth Century Fox)Story HighlightsCritics rating 4 stars out 5This is the perfect role for Ryan Reynolds an underrated actorThe jokes are nonstop and exhausting but there are more hits than missesIt takes a strong stomach for extreme violence and over-the-top obscenity but if youre willing to roll with that ""Deadpool"" is a hoot.You know from the start that this will be a different kind of movie. Director Tim Miller and screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (both from Phoenix) dispense with the typical opening credits. Instead we get titles like ""overpaid tool"" (Miller) ""a CGI character"" ""some hot chick"" and for Reese and Wernick ""the real heroes here.""This plays over a slowed-down action sequence that the film comes back to often after a series of flashbacks that give us the origin story of the title character. Yes an origin story. Despite its foul-mouthed digs at the genre ""X-Men"" in particular ""Deadpool"" plays at being an anti-origin story while most assuredly being one.So what?The story itself is simple. Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds never better) is an ex-Special Forces veteran who has become a gun for hire. He falls for a beautiful prostitute Vanessa Carlysle (Morena Baccarin) and for a time they enjoy a blissful life of sex companionship sex and when theyre not otherwise occupied more sex.But Wilson gets diagnosed with inoperable cancer. He winds up undergoing some back-alley treatment that leaves him immortal but hideously deformed (a testicle with teeth is one of the more colorful descriptions). So instead of saving good guys or taking out bad guys Deadpool as Wilson begins calling himself after sewing his own costume has a singular motivation revenge.He wants to get to Ajax (Ed Skrein) the creepy doctor who left him looking like well you know. When Ajax and his buffed-up sidekick Angel Dust (Gina Carano) kidnap Vanessa Deadpool becomes even more determined to find his foe and kill him. Not save the world or anything so grand as that.Wade Wilson (Ryan Reyonlds) and new squeeze Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) trade some pointed barbs in ""Deadpool."" (Photo Twentieth Century Fox)Along the way he will reluctantly get the help of minor X-men Colossus (the CGI character referred to in the opening credits) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) a bratty girl with awesome powers who manages to get a few choice texts sent before springing into action.Everything that happens gets the smart-aleck meta treatment from Deadpool. Everything.If there is a flaw here its that the nonstop commentary and jokes are exhausting. This is by design of course part of the school of comedy that too much is never enough. More jokes hit than miss but occasionally you wish Deadpool would come down with a case of laryngitis.This is no complaint about Reynolds; this is the perfect role for his self-deprecating wit. Ive always thought he was a pretty good actor and here hes exactly where he should be.AZCENTRALSnarky Deadpool writers met at Phoenix high schoolAnd you have to love the shots he and the film take at the genre. Part of the deal is that despite the entreaties of Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead Deadpool has no interest in becoming a member of the X-Men proper. Or so he says; dont be surprised if he shows up in a future film.But in the meantime in addition to brutal takedowns of his would-be teammates he makes fun of having two actors play Dr. X (""confusing"") and notes its weird how in this movie only a couple of X-Men show up -- why he says its almost as if the film couldnt afford bigger stars and more characters.Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool relaxes before leaping into battle. (Photo Twentieth Century Fox)Theres a lot of breaking of the fourth wall -- at one point there is Deadpool points out a fourth-wall break of a fourth-wall break resulting in what? A 16th-wall break? Again theres too much of this but when it hits it hits.Its always welcome to see T.J. Miller who plays Weasel the bartender who helps Deadpool. And Leslie Uggams is funny as the blind woman Deadpool lives with when hes especially down on his luck. Nothing is sacred including her condition which results in one of the funniest if cruel jokes in the movie.AZCENTRALDeadpool (2016) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsIts tempting to say that with the success of the terrific ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and now this were done with the straightforward superhero movie. Maybe were so saturated with movies dipping into the same universe again and again that a heavy dose of meta irony will become a requirement from here on out.Just kidding of course. When ""Captain America Civil War"" hits theaters in May itll probably do boffo business at the box office; the mainstream Marvel movies arent exactly groundbreaking in their plotting.Which is fine. Lets enjoy ""Deadpool"" in the meantime.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

Self-satisfied to the point of irritation ""Deadpool"" is the latest in an apparently endless supply of superhero films -- and like just about every other new superhero movie its clearly designed as the launching point for a future franchise. (See ""Daredevil"" ""Catwoman"" ""The Green Hornet"" and not one but two ""Fantastic Four"" efforts. Actually I like you so please DONT see any of those movies.) Directed with no small amount of flash and style by Tim Miller ""Deadpool"" stars Ryan Reynolds in a bit of casting thats almost too easy seeing as how the character of Deadpool is a real wisenheimer and Reynolds has long specialized in playing fast-talking quipsters. The comically violent opening action sequence and the credits serve notice were in for a superhero movie that will be as much about spoofing the genre and winking at the audience as it will be about serving up a genuine storyline. In fact the credits are kind of great as were told the movie will feature ""A British Villain"" and a ""CGI Character"" was produced by some ""Real A-hats"" and was written by ""The Real Heroes."" (We also get references to Reynolds ill-fated turn as ""Green Lantern"" his heavily criticized appearance as Deadpool in ""X-Men Origins Wolverine"" and his 2010 ""Sexiest Man Alive"" People magazine cover.) Clad in a pseudo-sadomasochistic red-and-black leather costume wearing a mask vaguely reminiscent of the getup sported by The Gimp in ""Pulp Fiction"" Deadpool is an unstoppable killing machine who takes great pleasure in mowing down bad guys while keeping up a stream-of-consciousness monologue filled with one-liners mostly lazy pop culture references random thoughts (""Did I leave the stove on?"") and more than a few homoerotic observations. (Deadpools romantic interest is a woman but the way he talks about Wolverines um equipment and the conversations he has with men make us wonder if hes interesting in expanding his horizons.) ""Deadpool"" hits the ground running with a gory shootout on a highway and those cool credits -- but soon after that were plunged into a prolonged flashback in which we learn you guessed it THE ORIGINS OF DEADPOOL. Again with the origin story? Whether its ""Spider-Man"" or ""Ant-Man"" ""The Hulk"" or ""Captain America"" ""Wolverine"" or ""The Fantastic Four"" rare is the origin movie with an origin actually worth a giant chunk of a movie. (""Batman Begins"" and ""Iron Man"" being two exceptions.) In ""Deadpool"" with the anti-hero himself narrating the journey even telling us when he breaks the fourth wall (and breaks the fourth wall of the fourth wall making 16 walls as Deadpool points out) we learn Deadpool was originally a former Special Ops badass turned mercenary named Wade T. Wilson. Wades more than a bit of a jerk and he takes sadistic pleasure in inflicting pain on his victims -- but his targets are irredeemable criminals so we sorta like the guy. T.J. Miller has some winning moments as Wades best friend a bartender who loves to give him a hard time. Morena Baccarin is the alluring Vanessa who may or may not be a prostitute goes quip-to-quip with Wade and is clearly designed to be a takeoff on the obligatory superhero girlfriend -- but the role is really just the obligatory superhero girlfriend part. Just because a film acknowledges that doesnt make it less so. Wade falls in love with Vanessa and he keeps marveling at how shes so perfect its like a computer made her. Vanessa has an insatiable sex drive at one point taking charge in a way I really cant describe here. Its a perfect life Until Wade learns he has terminal cancer. Next thing we know Wade has volunteered for an experimental and radical treatment -- and we all know how well that sort of thing goes in superhero movies. Ed Skrein is the aforementioned British villain a torture specialist named Ajax who claims he feels no physical pain and no emotions whatsoever though Wade certainly gets under his skin. In scene after scene after scene Ajax inflicts unspeakable pain on Wade who keeps the jokes coming even when hes on the verge of dying. It takes far too long for Wade to emerge from the torture chamber as Deadpool who now has superpowers including the ability to heal from just about any wound -- but is also hideously disfigured and even more manic than ever. (Deadpools back story could have been told in about five minutes screen time.) Flash forward to present day and Deadpools obsession with tracking down Ajax and making him pay. Along the way he strikes up an uneasy alliance with mutants Angel Dust (Gina Carano) and Colossus (voiced by Stefan Kapicic) a Russian giant able to take on a metallic form. Director Miller proudly flaunts the R rating with some creatively horrific action sequences and Reynolds keeps up the banter till the very end. Problem is ""Deadpool"" like so many other satires ends up being not all that different from the films its spoofing. Also weve seen wisecracking anti-heroes time and again from ""The Mask"" to ""Iron-Man."" And its not really all that original to tell the story of a reluctant superhero who keeps telling everyone hes not a superhero. If ""Deadpool"" does well at the box office no doubt well see more chapters in the saga. I wouldnt be surprised if I liked the sequel more than the original. For one thing we wont get bogged down in an origin story. [s3r star=2.5/4] 20th Century Fox presents a film directed by Tim Miller and written by Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese. Running time 108 minutes. Rated R (for strong violence and language throughout sexual content and graphic nudity).

"Review Deadpool a dynamite superhero story but for adults only - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Deadpool a dynamite superhero story but for adults onlyBy Randy MyersSan Jose Mercury News CorrespondentPosted 02/10/2016 080000 AM PSTUpdated 02/10/2016 052122 PM PST Not another one. That might be the lackluster greeting for ""Deadpool"" the latest in a flood of comic book adaptations superpowering their way onto screens large and small.But the raunchy R-rated comedy with an ever-game Ryan Reynolds as Marvels irreverent mercenary is another showpiece in Marvels impressive gallery of adult-oriented films and series which includes Netflixs riveting ""Jessica Jones"" and the intense ""Daredevil.""But first a word of advice to parents This is not suitable material for kids. Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool. (Twentieth Century Fox) ""Bruce Manuel"" Twentieth Century Fox Twentieth Century Fox Yes Yes ( Bruce Manuel ) The reason ""Deadpool"" is dynamite is because everyone is in on the joke Deadpool -- known for his notoriously profane blabbermouth katana swords and flip attitude -- ribs and riffs off the superhero template. He breaks through that so-called fourth wall talking directly into the camera and more often than not it works. His jokester attitude fuels the film from its harried start to its blockbuster finale with a post-credits scene worth sticking around for.Establishing and then sustaining such a shoot-from-the-hip tone isnt easy. But in his feature-length directorial debut Tim Miller deftly handles the mayhem and loopiness dreamed up in a quirky screenplay from ""Zombielands"" Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick. Only now and then does the humor seem forced. Advertisement While ""Deadpool"" heralds the arrival of a talented new director its success belongs to Reynolds who also served as a producer. He is hilarious and sexy as Wade Wilson a former Special Forces tough guy who takes on freelance gigs like scaring a pizza delivery boy whos harassing a young woman. Wades world is upended when he learns he has terminal cancer. Shattered by the diagnosis he accepts the evil Ajaxs (Ed Skrein) dubious offer of a cure by receiving superpowers that will enable him to heal. But transforming Wade into Deadpool is no act of altruism; the result of the torture he endures to get there is hellish and it leaves Wade so heavily scarred he has to wear a costume to hide his cringe-inducing face.Whats most surprising about ""Deadpool"" isnt that it takes jabs at nearly everyone including the studio that produced it but the sweet and sultry romance that develops between Wade and a prostitute Vanessa Carlysle (Morena Baccarin of Showtimes ""Homeland""). The two have great chemistry and a hot sex scene montage -- which is both playful and revealing -- is one of the films more clever sequences.Baccarin a feisty presence deserves notice for her performance here. Leslie Uggams summons up some good laughs as Deadpools blind roommate while T.J. Miller (HBOs ""Silicon Valley"") brings a slyness to his barkeep at Sister Margarets Home for Wayward Girls -- the watering hole where Wade hangs out with other toughies.Also getting into the zany spirit are Gina Carano as Angel Dust Ajaxs formidable heavy and the two-person team of CGI-created X-Men mutant Colossus and his sort-of sidekick Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand).While their contributions give the film some fizz its Reynolds who pops the bubbly. His record in superhero movies may be spotty (lets try to forget his Hal Jordan in the boring ""Green Lantern"").

Deadpool Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2016) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/deadpool-2016,200,deadpool32,deadpool,rogerebert
"Deadpool review Ryan Reynolds is an immortal but unsightly killing machine - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Deadpool review Ryan Reynolds is an immortal but unsightly killing machine Deadpool official trailer The official trailer for ""Deadpool"" starring Ryan Reynolds and set for theaters on Feb. 12 2016. The official trailer for ""Deadpool"" starring Ryan Reynolds and set for theaters on Feb. 12 2016. Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune A fairly funny trashing of its own glib self ""Deadpool"" is a movie about an unkillable wisenheimer who never shuts up even while enduring or inflicting enough putrid brutality to earn an X or a NC-17 rating just a few years ago.The masked antihero is played by Ryan Reynolds clearly having the screen time of his life to date. He sounds strikingly like his fellow Canadian Jim Carrey when he goes into manic-wisecrack mode riffing on everything from the ""Taken"" movies to adolescent male lust in relation to the film career of Bernadette Peters. The jokes break the fourth wall and refer back to themselves constantly. There are visual and verbal riffs on Ryans ""sexiest man alive"" People magazine cover and Reynolds earlier big-screen ""Green Lantern"" fiasco among other facets of his lightweight-but-hunky screen image. ""Deadpool"" showcasing a character born in a 1991 Marvel Comics ""New Mutants"" installment positions itself as the outsider Marvel franchise wannabe the one that breaks all the rules daring to make us care about the quasi-human conflicts (cancer for one) in a sea of nattering sarcasm and merry bloodletting. The movies far from dull. But first-time feature director Tim Millers film serves as critique as well an example of what ails the superhero movie industry as well as for your personal fatigue issues (if you dont have them good for you) with a film world crammed with Avengers and X-Men and their neighbors.Reynolds made a brief appearance as a more conventionally palatable Deadpool in ""X-Men Origins Wolverine"" (2009). With a zigzagging flashback structure the new film gives us the life and times of mercenary warrior Wade Wilson (Reynolds). His social life is split between beers with bartender pal Weasel (T.J. Miller) and a romance with barkeep/prostitute Vanessa Carlysle (Morena Baccarin of ""Homeland""). Shes identified in the opening credits cheekily as ""Some Hot Chick."" Screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick identify themselves in the same credits as ""The Real Heroes Here."" Early on Wilson learns he has late-stage cancer. Desperate for a cure he hooks up with the sadistic scientist Ajax (Ed Skrein) who subjects Wilson to a series of torture sequences. Cancers gone but so is his face and skin as he knew them and not even immortality can make up for it. Deadpool a sociopath wearing one of Spider-Mans knockoff head stockings is born and the rest of ""Deadpool"" grows into an increasingly routine revenge fantasy.As with ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" which was rated PG-13 the grungier potty-mouthier ""Deadpool"" benefits from a sardonic tone. Nothing in the Marvel/DC Comics film galaxies bores me more than apocalyptic combat that grinds on somewhere between ""forever"" and ""a day."" The movie can only avoid all that for so long. But at least it starts somewhere new. And Reynolds is entertaining; its rather sweet to see this eternally not-quite-a-star get closer than usual to justifying star billing.

He jokes a lot as the body count rises. (Joe Lederer) BY Ethan Sacks NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday February 10 2016 400 AM Title Deadpool Film Info A renegade superhero with a perverse sense of humor is out for revenge against the criminal outfit that unlocked his powers and disfigured him in the process. Directed by Tim Miller. With Ryan Reynolds Morena Baccarin and Ed Skrein. Rating R (138). Area theaters. This is not your fathers superhero movie -- and its certainly not for the kiddies either. Nominally a spinoff of Foxs ""X-Men"" franchise ""Deadpool"" earns its hard-R rating by saturating the audience with raunchy scatological humor and brutal arterial blood spray. The politically incorrect material suits Ryan Reynolds as snugly as Marvels tight red costume giving the Canadian actor a chance to work out his mutant power for hurling snarky one-liners. Its buckshot humor that is funny when it lands; cringe-worthy when it doesnt. ""Whose b--s did I have to fondle to get my own movie"" Deadpool asks the audiences in one of the movies many foul-mouthed meta gags. Reynolds stars as Wade Wilson a terminally-ill mercenary who is tricked into undergoing a life-saving procedure to activate his latent healing power orchestrated by a criminal mastermind (Ed Skrein). The experiment works but not without leaving Wilson horribly disfigured and out for revenge -- especially when the bad guys kidnap the love of his life Vanessa (Morena Baccarin). And boy is that revenge bloody with enough fetishistic close-ups on bullet-riddled foreheads to make John Woo queasy. Reynolds stars as Wade Wilson who undergoes lifesaving surgery and becomes a superhero bent on saving his girlfriend Vanessa (Morena Baccarin). (Joe Lederer) Theres no sign of the marquee X-Men including Hugh Jackmans Wolverine so Deadpool is left to team up with the franchises D-listers. Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and a Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) are the only members of the supposed super-team to regularly show up -- and the absence of the others does not go unnoticed by the protagonist. ""Its almost like the studio couldnt afford another X-Men"" Deadpool deadpans at the camera. Its a clever wink and nudge at the scale of the movie but legitimately also raises the question of why a movie-goer should shell out for a ticket when ""Batman v. Superman Dawn of Justice"" ""Captain America Civil War"" and ""X-Men Apocalypse"" loom in the coming attractions. Director Tim Miller a relative rookie makes the most out of his comic characters and the comic relief including scene-stealers T.J. Miller and Leslie Uggams. But the movie is very much Reynolds show -- and its clear at least Deadpool himself is enjoying the ride.

And thus the completely bonkers lovably obnoxious Deadpool boasts Juice Newtons Angel of the Morning.Somehow AM radio jams fit nicely into the utter insanity barely contained in director Tim Millers comic-book ode to ultra-violence four-letter words and weird love. Ryan Reynolds too benefits from finally finding a role that matches his wit and his abs -- even if his handsome mug is hidden under a mask most of the time -- though Deadpool (1/2 out of four; rated R; in theaters nationwide Friday)  sometimes cant keep up with its own madcap energy.Plot gets shot in the head and thrown in the trunk in favor of Looney Tunes-esque shenanigans not to say thats a bad thing. A spectacular opening action scene introduces Deadpool aka Wade Wilson the ""Merc with a Mouth"" who takes out baddies with ease -- and extreme prejudice -- and offers play-by-play commentary.USA TODAYDeadpool presents a movie superhero unlike any otherAmid the flying bodies and vehicles Deadpool narrates his origin story of how he fell in love with an exotic dancer (Morena Baccarin) just as messed up as he is was diagnosed with cancer and underwent a ghastly procedure that gave him superhuman abilities and the very definition of a ""pizza face.""On the road to saving his fair Vanessa spending bro time with his barkeeper confidant Weasel (T.J. Miller) and taking revenge on the villainous Ajax (Ed Skrein) Deadpool comes to crazy life with Reynolds on-point comic timing and knack for saying the most offensive stuff imaginable in a palatable way.In a movie so over the top that it obliterates said top Deadpools outsize personality tends to overshadow the rest of the characters. Ajax especially comes off as two-dimensional and his super-strong henchwoman Angel Dust (Gina Carano) just punches stuff (though she does it well). Deadpool takes place in the X-Men movie universe so the main antihero gets to spend hilarious screen time with a couple of folks from the comics the earnest steel-bodied Russian named Colossus (a CGI juggernaut played via motion capture by Stefan Kapicic) and angsty youngster Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) who deserves superlatives for best name and most in need of a spinoff.USA TODAYBlake Lively sits on a throne of DeadpoolsThere is juvenile humor aplenty though much better in Rhett Reese and Paul Wernicks script are intelligent riffs on other X-Men movies meta commentary on Reynolds failures in the superhero movie space (see Green Lantern) and whip-smart pop-culture references. (In one scene Deadpool compares cancer to Yakov Smirnoff opening for the Spin Doctors at the Iowa State Fair.)The problem of having so much wanton action and National Lampoon-style comedy is that its noticeable when its gone; the middle act slows considerably. And although a masked comic-book character whos funny and watchable appeals to children this isnt for kids -- although it is pretty much any prepubescent boys dream movie with sex and language that would make Captain America blush.For grown-ups however Deadpool avoids enough pitfalls to both embrace and flambe the superhero genre while also finding time for romance doling out equal handfuls of bullets barbs and warm fuzzies. 50 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 11 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1XgOc8Q",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/02/09/review-deadpool-movie-ryan-reynolds/80059854/,200,deadpool35,deadpool,usatoday

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Deadpool wastes no time at all establishing its crooked reality-bending sense of humor. The film opens on a tableau of mayhem like a three-dimensional version of the splash panel that might swallow pages two and three of any given Marvel issue. As the camera volleys from one frozen-in-time detail of grisly violence to the next a series of mock credits flash across the screen advertising that the movie stars ""A Hot Chick"" and ""A Gratuitous Cameo"" (you know by who) and that its been directed by ""An Overpaid Tool."" This will not be the last time that Deadpool acknowledges its own existence When not firing bullets and quips at everyone in range masked assassin Wade Wilson will often turn to the camera directly addressing the legions of fans in the audience. Breaking the fourth wall is just the start. This is a superhero movie that features in its own superheros words ""a fourth-wall break inside a fourth-wall break.""That meta quality comes straight from the source material the various monthly series miniseries and team books Deadpool has appeared in since the early 90s. Part Deathstroke ripoff part Spider-Man spoof the character spilled from the pen of Marvel defector Rob Liefeld who never met a psychotic derivative and anatomically impossible antihero he couldnt invent on the spot. Both a clear byproduct of the hyper-macho parodically ""extreme"" 90s comic culture and a knowing satire of the same Deadpool built a following by making like a murderous Bugs Bunny his self-aware asides a direct elbow into the ribs of the reader. Popular demand made a headlining hero out of the one-time villain but only during peak superhero saturation could one expect him to star in his own feature film. (Deadpools explanation He fellated Wolverine.)Thats Ryan Reynolds under the mask and prosthetic scar tissue harnessing the full power of his breathless sarcasm. After a slow and steady transformation into a genuinely talented actor (see Mississippi Grind if you havent) a gig like this might seem like a backslide into the smug shtick of his sitcom years were it not for the fact that Reynolds was born for the role If a surprising number of the films fast-flying jokes actually land its because the star knows just how to deliver them. Hes played the part before in the very first of the X-Men solo spinoffs 2009s all-around-regrettable X-Men Origins Wolverine. Naturally that folly gets cheekily referenced here as do Green Lantern and the Blade series; there are more allusions than plot points in this movie with screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick packing in nods not just to Reynolds history of aborted crime-fighting series but also to the Spin Doctors Adventure Time Bernadette Peters Taken Alien 3 and Jared from Subway.Deadpools R-rated irreverence knows few bounds. When a pre-disfigured Wade first encounters his love interest--a prostitute with a heart of gold and the mouth of a sailor played by Fireflys Morena Baccarin--their meet-cute involves gags about childhood sexual trauma. Later a torture montage is set to the jolly strains of ""Mr. Sandman"" which has to be the most ironic use of that song since the last time the Halloween franchise dusted it off. The problem with the film isnt that its an orgy of glib cartoon carnage. The problem is that all of that is a disguise Just as Deadpool himself wears a mask to hide his hideous features Deadpool conceals a highly conventional origin story under a lot of winking self-awareness.Beginning in media res with the deadly jokester on his way to exact some sweet revenge on the mad scientist (new Transporter Ed Skrein) who fucked up his face the film keeps flashing back to his creation myth--the by-the-numbers tale of how a secretly good-hearted mercenary agreed to play lab rat to cure his terminal cancer only to find that a Freddy Krueger mug is the price for painfully acquired healing powers. On the page Deadpool is usually written as a madman cipher in tights all blades guns and gags. His movie doesnt just fill out the characters backstory but adds an incongruous tragic dimension with Wade spying on his true love from the shadows like Spawn or The Thing or Darkman. And Reynolds for all the fun he has in costume cant resist making Wade more... upstanding. The actor normalizes him into the superhero he keeps claiming he isnt.Deadpool also attempts the tricky business of existing outside of the X-Men movie universe--of commenting on it even--while simultaneously operating within it. The films direct line to that series hub is metal-skinned Russian mutant Colossus who the movies have largely wasted so far. Depicted as a clunky CGI golem and partnered with a popular one-panel bit player named Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) Colossus appears for no other apparent reason than to open the door for a future X-Men crossover should this film prove a big-enough hit to warrant that. Deadpool can reference the actors who play the two Professor Xaviers (big laugh) and joke that the film couldnt afford the full team (even bigger laugh) while still waiting in the wings to be brought into the franchise proper. Like bartender sidekick T.J. Miller noting that a certain decision ""might further the plot"" its lampshading taken to its post-modern limits.By the time the film reaches its big-battle climax--divested of world-saving stakes for once at least--no number of lopped-off limbs four-letter words or in-joke sops to the faithful can oppress the stench of formula. Deadpool wants it both ways The character is at once a sociopathic narrative-bending imp and potential team material in the same way that his starring vehicle thumbs its nose at the same heros arc to which its basically adhering. The eccentric touches--a Wham musical cue a dash of screwball body horror--are just accents on a stealth franchise extension. At a certain point you have to do more than just recognize and point out the mold. You have to actually shatter it.

Its an insult that applies just as easily to the film itself. Bloody shallow and oh-so-smug Deadpool is so eager to offend that itd almost be sweet if it wasnt so well relentlessly annoying. We first meet Wade Wilson as an ex-military drifter working as a thug-for-hire and about to fall madly in love with (you guessed it) a hooker-with-a-heart Vanessa (Morena Baccarin). When hes diagnosed with terminal cancer Wade is suckered in by a shady corporation run by the villainous Ajax (Skrein) who promises to save his life. The cure leaves Wade disfigured and scarred but pumped with advanced healing powers a hunger for revenge and a thing for bright red Lycra. Clearly inspired by the ooh-arent-we-naughty sweary superheroics of Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass Kingsman) Deadpool is the kind of movie that thinks a shot of the hero being dildoed by his girlfriend on International Womens Day is feminist enough to make up for the fact that shes a foxy ex-prostitute and the script is peppered with rape jokes. It all looks cheap and grimy - whether this is a stylistic choice or a budgetary issue isnt clear. Meanwhile the action sequences sacrifice tension and excitement in favour of hyperactive editing and splattering gore. The result is rarely boring but its not half as smart funny or subversive as it clearly believes itself to be. That said sweaty 15-year-old boys are going to be in heaven.

Watch with friends.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreApr 27 2016Monica G.tastemakerFeaturedMarvel has done it again - bringing something different while having a very well- written and humurous movie. I think Marvel did Deadpools character justice as I had very low expectations going to see the movie thinking that it will be overhyped. Would watch it for the humour and will keep closing my eyes for the gore. All in all a 4 out of 5 for me.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreApr 2 2016Diana TTastemakerFeaturedSo as a huge superhero fan I love Deadpool and hate it at the same time. I find it is an amazing reflection of the comics but the humor is a little too crude for my usual taste. Some of the scenes were laid out amazingly and some of the witty lines were perfect but at times it became a little bit too much. Id go and see it again just for the laughs but Id really have to be in the mood. Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMar 30 2016nicknicknTastemakerFeaturedThis film is more super anti-hero than superhero.It is witty funny knowing. It is also violent rude irritating and self referential. One thing it isnt is dull. It pokes fun at all the superhero cliches and then goes ahead and uses them anyway. It points out how formulaic the genre has become then sticks to that formula. Great funHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMar 29 2016Niomi HarrisTastemakerFeaturedOne word hilarious I was laughing my head off from start to finish. It was silly crude shocking disgusting cringy- all the things you wouldnt find in a conventional super hero movie. But Deadpool is proud of the fact that its not typical of the genre. Please note this is NOT for kids- its a 15 for a reason A woman behind us soon learned that 10 minutes in and quickly ushered her children out just as the sex scene got into full swing. Dont go expecting anything meaningful and deep with a heartfelt message; it is what it is. Youll either love it or hate it. OK thats more than one word.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMar 28 2016Jane G.TastemakerFeaturedIt had its moments but the manic mouth got on my nerves very quickly. I would have loved a slightly more toned down version. Lots of action Loved the story Worth a see but not for childrenHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMar 17 2016james bFeaturedThe only superheroes I like are the reluctant heroes like Hellboy and Deadpool would work well in a dynamic duo with Hellboy. The dark humour suits me and Deadpool doesnt disappoint. The only area that went on a little too long was the girlfriend stuff probably featured to attract a female audience.If you liked HB then youll love this filmHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMar 11 2016Kevin JFeaturedDeadpool is like a cheeseburger. Its not gourmet. Its not going to win awards and youve had better meals in your lifetime. Almost certainly.But sometimes sometimes you just want a cheeseburger. And Deadpool is a damn good cheeseburger.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMar 1 2016Tiago AlmeidaTastemakerFeaturedA Hot chic a British villain a moody teen a CGI character a gratuitous cameo and the most unconventional super hero ever - This is what youll find in this film. Now add - blood detached body parts and brain pieces all flying around with sex boobs bums and inappropriate jokes and you now have Deapool.if you like all the above then youll absolutely love this film - at least I did. )Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreFeb 26 2016Katie FTastemakerFeaturedI dont really like superhero films and (shock-horror) Ive never seen any of the X-Men films or Marvel franchise films...sorry I got dragged along to Deadpool on Sunday and to my surprise actually enjoyed it quite a lot. Im probably approaching it from the best perspective with no expectations and no desire to analyse the depth and meaning behind the plot. Yes its superficial yes its silly but I found the whole movie very entertaining. Being not a guy and not a teenage guy I was scared that the humour would be slap-sticky lad-dy and just plain silly but I actually found myself laughing out loud a lot. I liked the quick and witty dialogue laced with huge amounts of sarcasm and it was a very pleasant change from the typical superhero cheesy grandeur. Its not going to win any awards but its a fun and entertaining watch.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreFeb 25 2016Hong-AnhTastemakerFeaturedWith the ever-expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe in danger of becoming a bloated juggernaut have we reached Peak Superhero? On the surface of it Deadpool could have been the perfect vehicle to reflect on this - it could have been a subversive and postmodern take on the superhero genre. Instead what weve gotten is a film that thinks that it is witty and subversive but in reality is two hours of lad bantz in Lycra. There are some nice touches in the film the structure of the film revolving around one action sequence and the snappy exposition but overall its one for the completists and the teenage boys.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreFeb 24 2016Vishaal VTastemakerFeaturedAverage film - there are at few funny moments but fundamentally the plot is superficial and not very engaging. The characters are not really explored in much depth which would have been nice. Overall stick to a proper comedy or proper superhero film this is stuck in the middle - not a great place to be.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreFeb 23 2016Andy SFeaturedSo exactly how is it possible for Deadpool to be inspired by stuff that came along several years later  it looks like the douchebag at timeout seems to have a few facts mixed up  probably better to do a little research before writing reviews in future my dear ...Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreFeb 22 2016Richard NTastemakerFeaturedConsidering all the jokes Deadpool had in its marketing Im surprised the romantic element of the movie actually was a driving force for the plot. This was a pretty fun film whose budget got unfortunately slashed. I dont regret watching it and even the violence wasnt that gory (though it certainly was over the top). It definitely fell short of its full potential though but for a low budget superhero film Id say it was a success at keeping it simple and were brutally honest to the source material and honestly makes for a fun night out. Watch it Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreFeb 21 2016Tamara BTastemakerFeaturedA satirical superhero film the irreverent humour throughout was pretty sharp and the characters fairly well-developed. Theres some fourth-wall breaking moments. It has its fair share of gore and filth and its not to be taken too seriously - a fun film.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreFeb 21 2016Sarah GTastemakerFeaturedDeadpool is good fun - stupidly sick darkly funny ludicrously violent. Balances everything just right as it had the potential to be awful but I was fully entertained and not irritated. If you like super hero movies and irony - thinks like Kick- ass you will enjoy this. Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreFeb 18 2016Luisa GTastemakerFeaturedFunny superhero movie not really any plot but good to see some strong women in the filmHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreFeb 17 2016Kirsty StastemakerFeaturedNot the best superhero film shallow plot line and really focuses on the comedy aspect rather than the blood and guts he spills in every scene. Good graphics end fight scene is samey and nothing new. Ryan plays the character well and does make me lol. Worth watching in the cinema but I wouldnt watch it a second time round.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreFeb 16 2016BoB DFeaturedI see the reviewer doesnt have a clue about source....since kick-ass is 2008 while deadpool is from 1991....Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreFeb 15 2016Kishma STastemakerFeaturedDeadpool is purposefully offensive but clever with it. As an original Marvel character (not a Kick Ass/Kingsman wannabe) Deadpool is unique in that he knows hes a fictional character. As this is a Marvel film it comes with the requisite Stan Lee cameo. However its is miles away from the normal superhero fare. This is mainly because Deadpool isnt a superhero; more of an anti hero with superpowers. Its violent and littered with sexual references but i thought it was a good way to spend Valentines day and Im not even a sweaty 15 year old boy.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map },http://www.timeout.com/london/film/deadpool,200,deadpool37,deadpool,timeout

No matter what youd say to him hed manage to make it about his dick or about anal sex or about how girls -- so he had heard -- smelled like fish. I asked him what he was seeing when I ran into him at a movie theater once and he replied ""Happy Spillmore."" His best still make me laugh. ""I am sick of all your innuendos"" our bus driver said. He played dumb in response ""Tonight you want me to come in your window?""Deadpool is the movie he probably hoped Happy Gilmore would be. Its hero Marvel Comics ""Merc With a Mouth"" is a sort of shock-jock Spider-Man with the Punishers arsenal Wolverines healing powers and the dialogue of one of those open-mic comedy dudes who believes its some kind of courageous truth-telling to point out that men like blowjobs. Onscreen he cant go a minute without delivering a one-liner about jerking off or calling the bad guy a ""cock thistle"" or a ""wheezing bag of dick tips."" In a tense moment in his pre-costume life talking with his love (Morena Baccarin) about how hell deal with the cancer thats killing him he spouts with some wistfulness ""If I had a nickel for every time I spanked it to Bernadette Peters...""Film Details Deadpool RatingR GenreAction/Adventure Running Time107 min. More Info Trailer EXPAND Joe Lederer And between the patter its splatter some of it memorable Deadpool pinballs the severed head of Mook A to take out Mook B and he cheerily loses the use of every limb Monty Python and the Holy Grail-style fighting the immovable Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) on loan from the X-Men movies. Its all too much by design; its also by design that carping about it makes you feel like a killjoy. Go ahead and go nuts if your life has a void in it that can only be filled by a superhero who gets an eyeful of Gina Carano and immediately declares that she must have a ""wang"" -- and later compares her to Rosie ODonnell. You just cant pretend its radical on-the-edge comedy when the hero picks the same joke targets as Donald Trump.So Deadpool is his films own junky retrograde RiffTrack cracking endlessly about balls and gayness about burn victims and Nineties bands and the conventions of superhero movies. Its Ryan Reynolds in the tights and he plays Deadpool like the man suffers from some kind of manic logorrhea like he just cant stop. He expectorates three jokes in a row in one shot of one scene and never looks like he cares whether any land. That distancing occasionally makes the film play like something more interesting than it is a study of a man who transmutes pain into relentless hostility were supposed to excuse as comedy. Deadpool is essentially a comment-thread joker with an actual mission -- tracking down the Evil Marvel Scientist (Ed Skrein) who gave him superpowers via the Wolverine torture-lab method.Some of the jokes hit especially in the opening in which false credits promise us that the film was ""Produced by Asshats"" and stars ""Some Idiot"" and ""A Hot Chick."" The joke at first seems to be that Deadpool himself has penned these and that they reflect his in-the-know perspective on the way studio executives think. But then comes the kicker ""Written by The Real Heroes Here."" Thats funny but it also makes it clear that no this isnt from the madmans perspective Deadpool isnt satire. Its instead another of Hollywoods Stan Lee Variations one where the dude hero lampoons every familiar story beat but still gets to prove he deserves the love of a great beauty by saving her from the bad guys. EXPAND Joe Lederer Still for those of us who dont find every deviation from hetero life a riot Deadpool at least offers some relief from superhero solemnity. This is an origin story told through twining flashbacks and (as the hero himself points out) it sometimes pushes unpredictably into other genres Theres fifteen minutes of goofy horny love story plus an effective descent into medical horror and a satisfying superhero team-up at the end. Reynolds gamely takes ribbing about his wretched Green Lantern and being named Peoples sexiest man alive and its welcome when the movie (and not just its hero) rouses itself for a big joke One montage of villain-pounding keeps cutting back to one bleeding baddie crawling slowly across an ice rink while Deadpool pursues him in a barely moving Zamboni.Deadpool benefits from an intimate story with more heart than you would expect but also a go-for-broke zeal edging at times into Naked Gun-style parody. (Even then though the targets are easy blind people Ikea furniture.) The crossover business with X-Men Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) is especially strong as they actually get to talk back -- and theyre both funnier than Deadpool. Like Ant-Man from Marvel-Foxs rival Marvel-Disney the movie gets wilder and better as it goes and its creators get two things right that that last Avengers botched The fights all feel personal and the final battle has many of the best gags. Deadpool might even stand as one of the strongest and most inventive films of the high-early-late superhero baroque -- if we could just turn off its built-in commentary track.

"Deadpool Review Ryan Reynolds Kills It as Marvels New Anti-Hero | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review Deadpool Justin Chang Chief Film Critic JustinCChang 22 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr Courtesy of 20th Century Fox February 6 2016 | 0900PM PT Ryan Reynolds gets the full-throttle wisecracking showcase he deserves in this scabrously funny origin story. At this point a movie studio would have to torch its headquarters donate its merchandising revenues to charity and produce a seven-hour art film performed in Ukrainian sign language to do something that truly qualified as a subversive gesture. Until then viewers should gladly submit to the gleefully self-skewering pleasures of ""Deadpool"" a scabrously funny big-screen showcase for the snarkiest of Marvels comic-book creations -- a disfigured and disreputable mercenary who likes to crack wise bust heads and generally lay waste to the idea that hes anyones hero. As a vehicle for the impudent comic stylings of Ryan Reynolds this cheerfully demented origin story is many many cuts above ""Green Lantern"" and as a sly demolition job on the superhero movie it sure as hell beats ""Kick-Ass."" And given the resurgence of fanboy interest following a well-received trailer at last years Comic-Con (plus the benefit of Imax showings) ""Deadpool"" should show plenty of life at the box office especially if its well-earned R rating functions less as kiss of death than as badge of honor. Fast ferocious and inevitably a bit too pleased with its own cleverness this Fox-produced offshoot of the ""X-Men"" series nevertheless cant help but feel like a nasty nose-thumbing tonic next to the shinier delegations of the Marvel Cinematic Universe as represented by Disneys ""Avengers"" franchise (and its various subfranchises) and Sonys not-so-amazing ""Spider-Man"" movies. Better still ""Deadpool"" knows exactly how to use Reynolds an actor whose smooth leading-man good looks have long disguised one of the sharpest funnyman sensibilities in the business as fans of ""The Proposal"" ""Definitely Maybe"" and the underrated ""Just Friends"" can attest. Its not the kind of star profile that immediately screams ""blockbuster"" (thats a compliment) and admittedly Reynolds peripheral first appearance as Deadpool in ""X-Men Origins Wolverine"" (2009) offered little hint of what he could really do with the role; happily this wholesale reboot seems to inhabit a superior alternate reality where that dreadful earlier movie doesnt exist. Deadpool does drop a few ""X-Men"" references here and there and theyre crude and irreverent in the extreme whether hes joking about fondling Wolverines privates or dismissing Prof. Xavier as a creepy pedophile -- all of which he offers up as evidence of his spectacular disinterest in contributing in any way to the ever-expanding glut of superhero movies. Thats nonsense of course. Even with its nastier tone grislier action and more sexually explicit banter ""Deadpool"" turns out to be a comic-book enterprise through and through but served up in a shrewdly self-mocking guise; it pulls off that very postmodern trick of getting away with formulas and cliches simply by pointing them out. The opening credits sequence features what might be described as an honest cast list even going so far as to introduce first-time feature director Tim Miller as ""An Overpaid Tool."" That eagerness to break down the fourth wall was present in the original Deadpool comic books by writer Fabian Nicieza and artist/writer Rob Liefeld and scribes Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (doing wittier work than youd expect from their scripts for ""Zombieland"" and ""G.I. Joe Retaliation"") stay true to the same spirit as they cut cheekily between two time frames using Reynolds smartass voiceover to paper over the cracks. Before he turns into an ugly cynical mercenary named Deadpool Reynolds character is a hunky cynical mercenary named Wade Wilson who spends most of his time at Sister Margarets Home for Wayward Girls -- a front for the scuzzy dive where his best friend bartender Weasel (T.J. Miller ""Silicon Valley"") keeps the beer flowing and the weapons moving among his down-and-dirty clientele. Its here that Wade meets a beautiful gold-hearted prostitute named Vanessa Carlysle (Morena Baccarin ""Homeland"" ""Gotham""); recognizing each other as damaged kindred spirits they begin screwing in earnest zipping and unzipping their way through an extended sex-scene montage that plays out over a years worth of racy holidays. (""Happy Intl. Womens Day"" Vanessa coos as she adjusts her strap-on though thats about as far as the movie goes in terms of even hinting at Deadpools famously pansexual appetites.) Wade and Vanessa are deeply in love but their bliss proves short-lived when he receives a terminal cancer diagnosis. This being an origin story his only recourse is to submit to a bizarre experiment performed by the sadistic scientist Ajax (Ed Skrein) ignoring the rule that one should generally steer clear of medical professionals named after Greek warriors and household cleaners. Ajax subjects Wade to a series of increasingly grim procedures accompanied by hideous torture techniques in an attempt to force a genetic mutation that will rid him of his cancer. While successful in that regard the procedures unfortunately also rid Wade of his face turning him into a bald lump of scar tissue who looks less like Ryan Reynolds and more like a 150-year-old John Malkovich in desperate need of wrinkle cream and sunblock. Now gifted with Wolverine-style self-healing abilities and an endless lease on life Wade wants his old body back and so he dons a rubbery red-and-black suit (the better to hide the bloodstains) and the identity of Deadpool. What follows is a fairly straightforward shoot-and-blow-em-up revenge picture starting with a visceral car chase/standoff that occupies much of the films early going and midsection. ""Im just a bad guy who gets paid to f--k up worse guys"" Deadpool snarls in one of his many to-the-camera asides which he frequently uses to drop jokes about masturbation and defecation plus random references to the Spin Doctors ""The Matrix"" Sinead OConnor Judy Blume the ""Taken"" movies and any other stray bits of pop-culture effluvia that happen to pop into his mottled misshapen head. If it all sounds terribly arch and juvenile it is. Its also startlingly effective Somehow through sheer timing gusto and verve (and an assist from Julian Clarkes deft editing) Reynolds gives all this self-referential potty talk a delirious comic momentum -- reaching a peak when hes trading quips with Blind Al (Leslie Uggams) the wizened sightless old woman who functions as his caretaker housekeeper and sparring partner. Additional punching bags turn up in the form of two X-Men allies Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) basically an overgrown Arnold Schwarzenegger hood ornament and sullen goth girl Ellie Phimister aka Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) whose mutant powers include conjuring massive fireballs and sending angry tweets. The two of them exist mainly to keep Deadpool in line and also to help him battle Ajax and his impossibly strong lieutenant Angel Dust (Gina Carano). But in the end these supporting players are so much background noise -- drowned out on occasion by the repetitive sounds of explosions gunshots and body slams and also by the constant wham (and Wham) of the soundtrack. Baccarin after getting to play Rosalind Russell to Reynolds Cary Grant early on is ultimately treated in line with the ""Hot Chick"" moniker shes given in the opening credits. Miller has fun staging all manner of vehicular and architectural chaos but mostly stays out of the way of his script and his star. The movie exists entirely as a star vehicle for Reynolds and perhaps its canniest stroke is the way it both conceals and demolishes his physical beauty -- a small price to pay when an actors tongue is this gloriously sharp. ""I look like a testicle with teeth"" Deadpool snarls. And as long as hes around youll have a ball. Film Review DeadpoolReviewed at 20th Century Fox Studios Jan. 30 2016. MPAA Rating R.

Im socially aware and get all of the inside jokes but for me this movie was heavy on blood gore and vulgarity and very light on anything else. It just moved from one obscene fight to another while the love story is just rough porn between two unlikable characters. Then just as fast as the frenzied sex scenes now he has cancer and the mood of the movie becomes overly serious and melodramatic. Since the movie starts without any character synopsis other than a major battle with blood and gore NOW Im supposed to feel terrible for this idiots well being? Me and 5 friends got up and left the movie just after he was released from his incubator in a contrived plot line about why he hates the villain and needs to spend the rest of the movie hunting him down to get justice. What a piece of shit and a waste of 12. I should have realized i was in trouble when the audience was basically full of 16-20 year old boys Reply Shannon says February 20 2016 at 837 am I was confused when watching this movie. HE NEVER STOPS TALKING He is overwhelming sarcastic. Although there are some parts of the movie that are genuinely funny his monotonous blabbering never ceases. He should relax a bit and let the audience get each punchline instead of him having to explain each funny circumstance. I think I would have enjoyed the movie more if people werent smoking pot in the theater and laughing at things in the movie that werent funny. Reply William White says February 27 2016 at 527 pm Thats what Deadpool does. LOL Read his comics. Reply thescreencave says February 16 2016 at 754 pm This is a great comic book movie.

Reply Bill B. says February 7 2016 at 1138 am I dont care all that much for super hero movies but this sounds like fun. Reynolds is a decent amp; likable actor but his forte is comedic timing and it sounds like he has found a perfect role for himself.

But he is definitely not your kids. That is unless your kid is into grungy strip clubs gory ninja warfare and an endless stream of graphic sex jokes. Weve had R-rated comic book movies before even superhero ones; the two ""Kick-Ass"" movies hit new heights or depths in gleefully sadistic fight scenes. Still after several years of the genre (and especially Marvel) working overtime to hold onto that profitable PG-13 rating its a surprise to see a picture thats aimed at adults. Or at least at people who can get into R-rated movies. Its fun but its not for everyone and definitely not for families. Ironically in some ways the biggest influence on ""Deadpool"" may be the family-friendly ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" - like that surprise delight this movie takes a slightly esoteric Marvel character as its hero throws in some cheesy pop songs and doesnt take itself seriously. Thats apparent right from the title sequence which instead of using real actors names merely credits ""British Villain"" or ""This Idiot"" along with mercilessly tweaking star Ryan Reynolds past as the veteran of People pin-ups and the crashed-and-burned ""Green Lantern."" From there director Tim Miller takes us right into an action sequence - and suddenly its even clearer this is a different kind of Marvel movie. Not just because the violence is bloody (heads do roll literally) or that our supposed hero actually kills unarmed men but because he constantly breaks the fourth-wall to talk to us directly. The comic books did that too but the movie pushes it even a little further commenting on not just the people watching the movie but movies themselves as Deadpool jokes about Hugh Jackman or accuses the studio of being too cheap to hire more than two additional X-Men. Its a bit like the way Bob Hope used to rag Paramount in the old ""Road"" movies - except in this instance our heros a disfigured mercenary. A last-ditch treatment for cancer gave him the power to heal himself instantly but also left him scarred and a little unhinged. So now hes Deadpool out for revenge on the mad scientist who did this to him - and hoping to reunite with his sexy girlfriend. Thats the whole of the plot and the script doesnt do much to flesh it out. In fact it sort of skimps on everything. It doesnt explain Deadpools connection to the X-Men and the two who show up - Colossus and (no Im not kidding) Negatronic Teenage Warhead - arent very interesting. Its never even clear here what NTWs mutant powers are. And the generic ""British Villain"" the titles promised turns out to be well pretty generic - Jason-Statham-wannabe Ed Skrein as a mutant Cockney doctor with a painfully underwired Gina Carano as his buxom henchwoman Angel Dust. Realizing its all on him though Ryan Reynolds not only carries the movie he picks it up and runs with it. Hes always been a charming actor but lightweight and slightly unreal; something about his shoe-button eyes always made him look like a stuffed-animal version of a leading man. Here though hes mostly behind a mask (a filthy one too - nice touch). And so without the distraction of his looks we just have to focus on his toned body and his mocking voice as he delivers a nearly endless stream of wisecracks. (He prefaces one act of violence with ""Im about to do to you what Limp Bizkit did to music."") Not all the jokes connect and sometimes the movie is weirdly disconnected from real life. As in If youre only going to have two minority characters how about not making the Indian an obsequious cab driver and the black woman an elderly ex-junkie? Still theres Reynolds and a R-rated comic-book script which delights in its own filthy dialogue and bloody action without tipping over into unintentionally ridiculous sex scenes (like ""X-Men"") or way-too-gruesome gore (like the ""Sin City"" movies). ""I may be super"" Deadpool announces early on. ""But Im no hero."" Well maybe not. But hell do for now. Ratings note The film contains gory violence nudity sexual situations strong language and substance abuse. Deadpool (R) Fox (106 min.) Directed by Tim Miller.

TWITTER 2/12/2016 Ryan Reynolds stars as a superhero not quite like the others in the latest a and certainly raunchiest a Marvel movie directed by Tim Miller. For the multitudes who feared that after Fantastic Four Fox might simply be rummaging too far down into Marvels basement in search of a few more scraps of lucre the jokes on them. It takes a little while to get in gear -- or perhaps just to adjust to whats going on here -- but once it does Deadpool drops trou to reveal itself as a really raunchy very dirty and pretty funny goof on the entire superhero ethos as well as the first Marvel film to irreverently trash the brand. Just what anyone suffering from genre burnout might appreciate at this point as well as a big in-joke treat for all but the most reverent fanboys this film looks to be hitting the market at just the right time -- with Christmas releases now in the rearview mirror -- to rake in some sweet returns. Given the surprising amount of nudity raw sex jokes and nonstop underlined and bold-faced racy dialogue its amusing to picture the countless pubescent boys who will be plotting a way to get into this extremely R-rated romp. Not only does Ryan Reynolds give it his all shall we say but the conversations here mostly resemble the sort of thing youd expect to hear around last call at a Bakersfield biker bar. Or more to the point what youd get if you mashed up the dialogue from the two previous scripts written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick Zombieland and G.I. Joe Retaliation. Last seen decapitated and heading down the chimney of a nuclear plant at the end of X-Men Origins in 2009 Wade Wilson/Deadpool has always seemed like a tough nut to crack in terms of centering a mass-audience film on him. A brash and brazen mercenary hes an anti-hero with a film noir leads taste for the louche and low-down as well as a character who in narrative terms stands out due to his predilection for breaking the fourth wall. Whether he could make the grade as the leading man of a franchise of his own was always a question which partly accounts for the prolonged wait-and-see on Marvels part. Other reasons for hesitation lay in the character not being a superhero like all the others and if the pic were to be done right the necessity of an R rating -- a place Marvel has never gone before. How to reconcile the brands image and fan base with such material? The answer probably lies in the fact that Marvel is so successful now and so far down the line with their various franchises that shaking things up was seen as permissible and maybe even a good move. Or perhaps executives aware early on of what was happening with Fantastic Four said ""Opposite direction Now"" At first with some strained/cheeky opening credits (""a moody teen"" ""a gratuitous cameo"") followed by an emotional-investment-free highway action sequence notable for its splatter gore content things dont look promising -- just wiseass-y and needlessly violent. Who is this guy in red and black spandex with white fabric where eyes should be who fights with two katanas spins in the air in slo-mo and has wounds that heal at once? Shoot this guy full of holes and hell be back at you within seconds. ""I may be super but Im no hero"" he cracks. Why should we care? Flash back two years and things seem no better save perhaps for the dudes face which now plainly belongs to Reynolds. A grown man who hangs at a skateboard park Wade Wilson is a former Special Forces operative whose watering hole is a dive called Sister Margarets Home for Wayward Girls where the guys are all former soldiers of fortune who never hit the jackpot and the gals look like Hooters rejects. Wade and a bitter hooker named Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) hit it off and get it on in a kinky montage thats more out-there than what most Hollywood-made R-rated stuff ever serves up. Its right around here and immediately afterward when Wade is diagnosed as having late-stage cancer that ironically the film really starts to click. When a doctor mentions the possibility of going to Chechnya for special treatment Wade responds ""Isnt that where you go to get cancer?"" and you finally begin to sense that there might be something to this verbal speed-freak character after all. The positioning of the flashback seems simple but serves the movie extremely well especially with the arrival of Ajax (Ed Skrein deeply evil) a doctor and head of something called the WeaponX workshop who takes Wade on as a reclamation project and turns him into a fighting machine who can never die. Ajaxs sadism during the painful transformation process knows no bounds and at the end of the ordeal he takes particular pleasure in introducing Wade to his new face which resembles ground beef (Vanessas measured reaction to beholding it is ""Its a face ... Id be happy to sit on""). Now a freak behind his mask and form-fitting outfit Wade/Deadpool has it out for Ajax but their ultimate face-off previewed in the opening scene must wait until after Deadpool teams up with two unlikely cohorts the metallic giant Colossus who does what he can to protect him and a rebellious teen who cant possibly live up to her name Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand). For his part Ajax has his own one-woman hit squad in Angel Dust (mixed martial arts champ and Haywire star Gina Carano). The final showdown is very small potatoes by Marvel standards and of course predictable but compensates with humor which is what floats the entire project. The script has the feel of something gone over again and again and yet again to double the number of jokes each time. The machine-gun approach doesnt always hit but it does enough so that in the end the number of laughs is pretty high. Beyond even what Robert Downey Jr. has done in the Iron Man series Reynolds lets fly here in a manic sly self-conscious way that leaves you not quite knowing what hit you the irreverence slides quickly into lewd comic territory; the inside jokes about Marvel in particular and pop culture in general come fast and furious; the fourth-wall breakage is disarming; and the actors occasional fey high-pitched voicings add yet another strange element. As in the presence of motor-mouthed comedians you either sit there stone-faced or eventually capitulate to the cascade of weirdness and the fertility of wayward minds unleashed. A longtime commercials and visual effects executive and creative director Tim Miller hasnt so much directed his first feature as liberated much of what has been bubbling under the surface of superhero films for a long time; it answers a lot of the questions you were afraid to ask. For the record Deadpool features one of Stan Lees best Marvel cameos -- its actually funny.

Its suffused with an arch self-aware wit -- its titular hero violates the fourth wall more than Groucho Marx Bugs Bunny and Ambush Bug put together -- yet it takes its romance and revenge storylines just seriously enough to keep us engaged. Its a film thats amused with itself but thanks to a screwball screenplay by Rhett Rheese and Paul Wernick (""Zombieland"") and a charmingly snarky lead turn by Ryan Reynolds that amusement is both thoroughly earned and completely contagious. If you loved the way ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" turned the standard superhero formula on its spandex-covered ear -- and youre old enough to handle some very R-rated language and violence -- ""Deadpool"" delivers a similarly delightful surprise. See Video Deadpool Makes Indecent Marriage Proposal in Raunchy Official Clip From Movie Deadpool is a mercenary with a heart of lets give him the benefit of the doubt brass. Created in the comics by Rob Liefeld and Fabian Nicieza -- and previously problematically brought to the screen in ""X-Men Origins Wolverine"" -- hes a mouthy antihero unbound by the rules of superheroism and frequently prone to quip about the fact that he is a character in a movie one who would like nothing more than to get his hands on Ajax (Ed Skrein ""The Transporter Refueled""). Ajax you see took a cancer-stricken Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) and turned him into the indestructible Deadpool but the process involved continued torture that would make even the ""Zero Dark Thirty"" crew blanch. Since escaping from Ajaxs clutches Deadpool has sworn vengeance with the help of his roommate Blind Al (Leslie Uggams -- yes that Leslie Uggams) and bartender Weasel (T.J. Miller playing the comedic straight man for once). See Video Deadpool Baits Bachelor Viewers With Shameless TV Spot The person Deadpool wants to keep out of this vendetta is Vanessa (Morena Baccarin ""Gotham"") the love of his life -- Ajaxs treatment gave Wade powers but also turned his face into a cross between raw chuck and two miles of bad road so Wade would just as soon have Vanessa think hes dead. Its the chemistry between Reynolds and Baccarin that gives ""Deadpool"" most of its stakes; a lesser film would be undone by the heros constant looking at the camera and referencing the fact that this is all a movie but we genuinely care about whether or not Deadpool will reveal himself to Vanessa and whether Ajax will use her as a way to capture his nemesis and that gives this self-conscious movie some necessary grounding. And if youre here for superhero shenanigans director Tim Miller (making his feature debut) doesnt skimp on that either bringing in X-Men Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand Sundance entry ""First Girl I Loved"") to skirmish with Deadpool before the three team up to take on Ajax and Angel Dust (Gina Carano whos an ass-kicking special effect unto herself). Also Read Cable Creator Rob Liefeld Wants Jon Hamm to Play the Superhero A movie that both features a powerful mutant in tights and contains quippy references to Juice Newton and ""Are You There God? Its Me Margaret"" rides a fine line in turning off comedy and comic-book fans simultaneously but for me ""Deadpool"" hit the sweet spot of entertaining violence - theres nothing like an R-rated superhero movie to underscore the ludicrousness of this genres bloodlessness - and disengaging humor. ""Deadpool"" shouldnt work but it absolutely does.
