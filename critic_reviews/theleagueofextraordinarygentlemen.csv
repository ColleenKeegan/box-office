In The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen Connery sporting a singularly mediocre rug plays Allan Quatermain swashbuckling hero of colonial Britain who gathers together some of the most mythic figures of 19th-century fantasy literature into whats meant to be a kind of Classic Comics version of ""X-Men."" Connery purrs and growls with dependable Scottish-lion finesse but I kept wishing that he would rip that damn thing off his head. Then again hes far from the only one on screen to be undercut by his synthetically primped appearance. Virtually everyone in ""League"" looks as if he just escaped from a costume shop. Take Captain Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah) who wears a sword a blue turban and the bushiest of long black beards. Nemo is supposed to be the lordly commander of the Nautilus submarine but he looks more like a doorman at an Indian restaurant. Then theres Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend) - yes THAT Dorian Gray - who swans about in complicated facial hair and a silky gray pin-striped suit like a Savile Row runway model. If I make an issue of the way these people are dressed thats because there isnt a lot to them apart from their wardrobes. ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" is set in 1899 when the fate of the earth is suddenly at stake; Quatermain and his League are facing down the Phantom who plans to unleash new modern weapons of mass destruction (e.g. tanks and bombs) to foment world war. In addition to Nemo and Dorian Gray the League includes the Invisible Man (Tony Curran); Mina Harker (Peta Wilson) widow of Dracula investigator Jonathan Harker (and now a bloodsucker herself); the boyish Secret Service agent Tom Sawyer (Shane West); and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (Jason Flemyng). The movie is based on a 1999 series of comic books by Alan Moore and Kevin ONeill but the original tone of deadpan historical audacity has been replaced by a kind of wax-museum literalness. Basically were watching all of these famous names pasted onto a lot of anonymous grade-B acting and limply staged fight scenes. The director Stephen Norrington who made ""Blade"" has never shown much interest in mere mortals. Surprisingly though he does next to nothing with the lady vampire Mina who comes across as more embalmed than threatening or the Invisible Man a Cockney joker who covers himself in white greasepaint. The one character whos kind of fun to watch is Mr. Hyde a strappingly muscle-bound crew-cut simian giant who has been given just enough human qualities to point to what the makers of ""The Hulk"" should have done. Its not that the special effects are stellar (Hydes massive body looks like a wad of dirty Silly Putty) but that there are hints of wit to his titanic leering rages. Hes the only one on screen who seems to have figured out that gentlemen have less fun.

Comments The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen A stiff. I dont know the comic book series but it could hardly be as lifeless as this leaden adaptation in which the weapons have more personality than the characters and the nonstop action often feels like no action at all. The estimable Sean Connery stars as H. Rider Haggards adventure hero Allan Quatermain who joins forces with Vernes Captain Nemo Stokers Mina Harker Wellss Invisible Man Stevensons Dr. Jekyll Wildes Dorian Gray and Twains Tom Sawyer (grown up to become a U.S. Secret Service agent) to defeat a nefarious global plot hatched by Sherlock Holmess old nemesis Professor Moriarty (who also calls himself Fantom proving he doesnt know how to spell). But in fact none of those characters appear; these are just fast-food-franchise toys with familiar names slapped on them (Hyde for instance is a clumsy mix of Schwarzenegger and the Hulk). Stephen Norrington directed a witless script by James Dale Robinson. 111 min.

Directed by Stephen Norrington from a screenplay by James Dale Robinson based upon the comic books by Alan Moore and Kevin ONeill. 112 minutes. Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of fantasy violence language and innuendo. Several theaters. Its no easy trick to take an assortment of fascinating characters and create a movie about as exciting as a stale scone. But director Stephen Norrington and screenwriter James Dale Robinson have done just that with ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" a grayish plodding Victorian adventure. ""League"" began life a few years ago as a comic book by Alan Moore and Kevin ONeill with an irresistible premise A group of mid-Victorian literary/adventure characters band together in 1899 to save civilization from a masked madman. This superhero-ish gang includes adventurer Allan Quatermain (from H. Rider Haggards novels) Captain Nemo (from Jules Vernes ""20000 Leagues Under the Sea"" and other works) Mina Harker (Bram Stokers ""Dracula"") Dorian Gray (from Oscar Wildes novel) Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (from Robert Louis Stevensons novel) and others. This is heady stuff (think what fun we all could have had if the gang say traveled backward in time and showed up at Jane Eyres orphanage) and the comic book looks like a treat with elegantly detailed dark-toned drawings. Just the thing for a lively Saturday-matinee movie right? As a Victorian heroine might have said before retiring behind her veil Perish the thought. The movie alas isnt extraordinary at all; its just dull a little mystifying and more than a little cheesy. (Those who thought the Hulk looked fake should get a load of Mr. Hydes muscles; he looks like a jumbo-sized slab of blue-veined ham.) And thats a shame because it should have been a pleasure spending two hours with these characters -- each of whom in their original incarnation had more than enough personality to carry a movie. Here theyre each reduced to a trait. Quatermain is Sean Connery -- and apparently thats quite enough for any one character. Its always a pleasure to see Connery on screen but here he mostly strides around firing his gun taking his glasses on and off and having things explained to him. He does have that inimitable Connery way with a line. When Quatermain is told that the empire needs him he lobs back ""The queshtion is do I need the empire?"" -- and for a brief shining moment hope springs eternal. But the movie doesnt know what to do with him nor does he seem to know what to do with it. Mina Harker (Peta Wilson) was a leader of the League in the comic books Im told but here shes merely its token woman and resident vampire. These coexist uneasily; at one moment shes snarling with blood-drenched lips at another decorously acting as nursemaid to the wounded. (Granted a vampire nurse is an intriguing idea but nobody seems to have had the wit to pick up on it.) Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend) is foppish and witless. Rodney Skinner (Tony Curran) is invisible. So is Captain Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah) even though we can see him -- hes got virtually nothing to do except play host on his elegant submarine Nautilus. Tom Sawyer (Shane West) has been tossed into the mix as a token American -- hes not in the comic books -- and his presence is as pointless as you might imagine; hes a visual non sequitur. And the masked Phantom makes an underwhelming villain. He shows up in a Victorian library and gasps out ""I am the Phantom"" sounding like hes just returned from a workout or perhaps from a matinee performance of ""The Phantom of the Opera."" I half-expected him to start singing ""The Music of the Night"" and rather wished he had. As for the special effects -- the reason many of us watch an action/adventure film such as this -- we can only hope that the money saved went toward a worthy charity. Mr. Hyde as mentioned looks absurd and the films various explosions are always shown from a long distance and arent remotely convincing. (""The buildings are falling like dominoes"" shouts somebody during one action sequence. But alas wishing does not make it so.) Im told the comic books are much more fun than this (a quick glance through the first one certainly bore this out). Read them or read any of the original books these characters are based on for some real adventure. Theres little to be found here.

Starring Sean Connery Shane West Stuart Townsend and Peta Wilson. Directed by Stephen Norrington. (PG-13. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Before it gets tangled up in plot and trades its specialness for a series of action-movie cliches ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" has more than the usual promise. It depicts the world of a century ago in a way that comments on the anxieties facing the world today and it does so at least for a while with cleverness and a sense of fun. Plus it has Sean Connery a rock star among movie stars playing one of those great old heroic rogues whom only he knows how to make irresistible. So long as the camera is within range of Connerys steady gaze and faintly sardonic smile all is on course. Things go astray ultimately when Connery becomes just another fellow in a fight scene -- a man in a white toupee trading punches as the camera shakes and the soundtrack absolutely insists that were getting excited now. So ""The League"" is a movie to enjoy then to root for and finally to be disappointed by. Yet disappointment never degenerates into disenchantment for the simple reason that the films premise is so rich Several turn-of-the- century literary figures -- adventurer Allen Quatermain (Connery) Capt. Nemo Dorian Gray Mina Harker (from ""Dracula"") the Invisible Man and Dr. Jekyll -- are brought together to save the world from a power-hungry madman. Tagging along is an American agent named Sawyer (Shane West) presumably Tom Sawyer all grown up. The year is 1899 and whod have thought the world needed saving back then? Yet as depicted in ""League"" the world of a century ago is a rather fraught place. Intelligent people are catching on that science is about to get distressingly efficient at killing people. Around the corner are the tank the submarine handheld machine guns and chemical warfare. By showing the characters anxieties about the destructive possibilities of the 20th century the movie reminds us of our own similar anxieties. It invites us to stare out into the dark of our new century with a sense of awe and contemplation. Based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore and Kevin ONeill and adapted by James Dale Robinson ""League"" is about an extraordinary consortium in which each member has a valuable gift. Quatermain is a leader and an excellent shot. Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend) cant be killed. The Invisible Man (Tony Curran) has ""stealth"" on his side and Capt. Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah) is an inventor. Mina (Peta Wilson) is a vampire whos far from the frail figure played by Helen Chandler in the Bela Lugosi ""Dracula"" (1931). This Mina has been reconceived as a sleek high-kicking fighter a fin de siecle version of Diana Rigg in ""The Avengers."" The most major retooling of a character is the case of Dr. Jekylls Mr. Hyde persona who is now a giant the 19th centurys answer to the Incredible Hulk. Actually the sight of this Mr. Hyde (Jason Flemyng) in chains and growling in all his computer-enhanced glory is the movies first sign of trouble the first definite indication that what seems to be a thinking persons adventure might morph into a routine action movie after all. The languorous opening gives way to a plot big on spectacle and short on explanation or even clarity. Were told that a villainous general (Richard Roxburgh) wants to trigger a world war and to do this he decides for some reason to dynamite Venice. Why? Its not exactly an important seat of political power. This leads to an action sequence in Venice featuring a chase that compares poorly to the Venetian chase seen last month in ""The Italian Job. "" The Venice here reimagined on a soundstage resembles Venice as much as Toronto does Chicago. The movie maintains its impish spirit by throwing its famous literary characters together and making them clash and spark. The aesthete Dorian apparently once had an affair with Mina. Who knew? But more and more the storys heart -- or director Stephen Norringtons focus -- is the action and these scenes are no better than the usual. We get fights sometimes several simultaneously with frantic cuts to keep us apprised of their progress. And we get machine-gun sequences in which the machine guns never hit anything because the targets jump out of the way and the bad guys never adjust their aim. That wouldnt be sporting. Such scenes constitute almost half of ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" and its the half we could do without. - This film contains extended scenes of gun and sword violence.

In The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen Connery sporting a singularly mediocre rug plays Allan Quatermain swashbuckling hero of colonial Britain who gathers together some of the most mythic figures of 19th-century fantasy literature into whats meant to be a kind of Classic Comics version of ""X-Men."" Connery purrs and growls with dependable Scottish-lion finesse but I kept wishing that he would rip that damn thing off his head. Then again hes far from the only one on screen to be undercut by his synthetically primped appearance. Virtually everyone in ""League"" looks as if he just escaped from a costume shop. Take Captain Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah) who wears a sword a blue turban and the bushiest of long black beards. Nemo is supposed to be the lordly commander of the Nautilus submarine but he looks more like a doorman at an Indian restaurant. Then theres Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend) - yes THAT Dorian Gray - who swans about in complicated facial hair and a silky gray pin-striped suit like a Savile Row runway model. If I make an issue of the way these people are dressed thats because there isnt a lot to them apart from their wardrobes. ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" is set in 1899 when the fate of the earth is suddenly at stake; Quatermain and his League are facing down the Phantom who plans to unleash new modern weapons of mass destruction (e.g. tanks and bombs) to foment world war. In addition to Nemo and Dorian Gray the League includes the Invisible Man (Tony Curran); Mina Harker (Peta Wilson) widow of Dracula investigator Jonathan Harker (and now a bloodsucker herself); the boyish Secret Service agent Tom Sawyer (Shane West); and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (Jason Flemyng). The movie is based on a 1999 series of comic books by Alan Moore and Kevin ONeill but the original tone of deadpan historical audacity has been replaced by a kind of wax-museum literalness. Basically were watching all of these famous names pasted onto a lot of anonymous grade-B acting and limply staged fight scenes. The director Stephen Norrington who made ""Blade"" has never shown much interest in mere mortals. Surprisingly though he does next to nothing with the lady vampire Mina who comes across as more embalmed than threatening or the Invisible Man a Cockney joker who covers himself in white greasepaint. The one character whos kind of fun to watch is Mr. Hyde a strappingly muscle-bound crew-cut simian giant who has been given just enough human qualities to point to what the makers of ""The Hulk"" should have done. Its not that the special effects are stellar (Hydes massive body looks like a wad of dirty Silly Putty) but that there are hints of wit to his titanic leering rages. Hes the only one on screen who seems to have figured out that gentlemen have less fun.

Browse over 8 million products  Clothing amp; Jewelry  Computers amp; Electronics  Home amp; Garden  Kids amp; Family Gentlemen start your raspberriesBy Mike Clark USA TODAY The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is populated by Sean Connery surrounded by ordinary actors who are trying to trade in on the excitement conjured up by names of fame. You know folks like Captain Nemo Mr. Hyde Dorian Gray the Invisible Man and others the filmmakers are free to play with because theyre in the public domain. Sean Connery is 19th-century hero Allan Quatermain in Gentlemen. If one summer movie definitively points up how warm-weather Hollywood fare subordinates humanity to special effects this is the one. You cant say these characters lack a track record but not one of them is particularly engaging in this movie. Review of the movie The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen ( out of four) Stars Sean Connery Naseerudin Shah Stuart Townsend Peta Wilson Shane West Director Stephen Norrington Distributor 20th Century Fox RatingPG-13 for intense sequences of fantasy violence language and innuendo Opens Friday nationwide The murkiest-looking movie since Ben Afflecks Daredevil and about as lacking in charm this comic book spinoff deals with a mysterious Brit named ""M"" (James Bond fans will laugh) who recruits this crew and others to quell a madmans warmaking ambitions in 1899. But teens dont worry that the story takes place a century ago You still get your scene involving a high-speed automobile. Connery is Africa-based Allan Quatermain the same character Stewart Granger played in 1950s Oscar-nominated King Solomons Mines. You feel the strength of Connerys presence even during the frequent times hes off-screen. This leaves it to callow faces like Stuart Townsend as Dorian and Shane West as secret agent Tom Sawyer -- no lie -- to do some of the heavy lifting which proceeds to give them acting hernias. Nor is Peta Wilson from TVs La Femme Nikita any more compelling playing Mina Harker from Bram Stokers Dracula. Guess what her problem is? All you need for perspective is to ask yourself if 20000 Leagues Under the Sea isa better movie. Or maybe The Picture of Dorian Gray. Any Dracula pic? The Fredric March or Spencer Tracy Jekyll-Hyde? Britains The League of Gentlemen heist pic from 1960? Yes yes yes in spades. Even the cheesy Richard Chamberlain Quatermain pics from the mid-80s were more fun because at least they featured the young Sharon Stone in a cute perm. This movie is so boring that the mind floats to extraneous matters -- like how often does the cleaning person come in to keep Nemos Nautilus looking so amazingly spick-and-span? Four months from now and maybe faster if the second-week word-of-mouth matches that of several of Leagues summer predecessors the DVD version will have 19 hours of features on how the effects people got blades to dance in the air and one character to bulk up into a hulk. Just what the movies need another hulk. Fewer bogus pyrotechnics and a little less cardboard might at least have made the movie passable. All talk show host Charlie Rose would need for a fun time is a wooden table a pitcher of water and Jekyll or Gray just sitting there talking about the good old days.

One must ask whether the youth audience will be much interested in a picture populated by 100-plus-year-old names. The answer is almost certainly no which spells a dicey B.O. future. This review was amended on July 10 2003. The dawn of the age of superheroes and weapons of mass destruction is imagined in fanciful but literally overblown terms in ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen."" Operating from a disarming premise that brings together several of the late 19th centurys most celebrated literary figures to battle an evil mastermind of unprecedented ambition and technological means this highly elaborate venture offers some appealing elements -- exceptionally beautiful design atypical characters literacy and an intriguing intellectual basis -- that are ultimately engulfed by explosions effects and an affiliated ponderousness. Commercially one must begin by asking whether the international youth audience will be much interested in a picture populated by such 100-plus-year-old names as Allan Quatermain Dorian Gray Jekyll and Hyde Captain Nemo and of all people Tom Sawyer. The answer is almost certainly no which spells a dicey B.O. future for this obviously pricey 20th Century Fox release. After a century marked by mass annihilation or the threat of it and by tyrants who wreaked havoc on an unprecedented scale ""League"" harks back to a time -- 1899 -- when violent evil perhaps had narrower more specific targets. It thus comes as a shock to late Victorian London when a terrorist known as the Fantom is able to invade the Bank of England with a tank and after destabilizing the continent plots to blow up Venice during an emergency conference there among all the Euro heads of state. But given the lack back then of what we now know as superheroes or even of someone like James Bond a British gent with the conspicuous name of M (Richard Roxburgh) gathers together several famous and variously gifted figures to stop the Fantom in the four days that are left before the gathering on the lagoon. They are the Indiana Jones of his time legendary hunter-adventurer of ""King Solomons Mines"" Allan Quatermain (Sean Connery who might as well be playing the old James here); Jules Vernes brilliant underwater nomad Captain Nemo (Indian cinema vet Naseeruddin Shah); Oscar Wildes ageless and indestructible aesthete Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend); the equally invulnerable scientist-turned-vampire Mina Harker (Peta Wilson); invisible man Rodney Skinner (Tony Curran); the brilliant Dr. Jekyll and his beastly alter ego Mr. Hyde (Jason Flemyng); and last and under these circumstances definitely least Tom Sawyer (Shane West) the former Mississippi River rat who turns up here as a member of the Secret Service. Even if these characters mean little or nothing to many viewers they are introduced with a certain brio by ""Blade"" director Stephen Norrington working from a screenplay by James Dale Robinson that warmly embraces but doesnt overdo the literary refs already in place in the comicbooks by Alan Moore and Kevin ONeill. For starters there are large egos involved not to mention some back story Quatermain distrusts the ""pirate"" Nemo; Mina Harker and Dorian Gray had an affair some years back; Skinner and Jekyll/Hyde are outcasts of dubious standing; and all have questionable loyalty to or enthusiasm for the Crown. But more striking still is the world these living legends inhabit. Dark gilded and resplendent with the trappings of empire at its height the innumerable settings created by production designer Carol Spier abetted by arresting natural locations and the work of more than a dozen visual effects houses create an alluring environment rooted firmly in the past but edging into the future. The obviously artificial but vividly rendered look most recalls those of Alex Proyas ""The Crow"" and ""Dark City"" except set in recognizable turn-of-the-20th-century Europe. In this time when secret technology far outstrips that visible in everyday life the group is able to speed to Venice on Nemos enormous and elegant Nautilus submarine which looks 10 times the size of the beauty featured in ""20000 Leagues Under the Sea"" nearly 50 years ago. But theyre almost too late Shortly after the Nautilus plows down the canals looking for explosives underwater bombs start going off that start the city tumbling down and only some heroic fast-thinking prevents its total destruction. In short order Quatermain unmasks the Fantom and the final act is devoted to increasingly ordinary excuses for mayhem before the de rigueur fireworks of the finale. Far too little effort is paid to creating a compelling villain; for most of the time hes just a disfigured fellow behind a silver mask. A fascinating bad guy is always a worthwhile commodity in fare like this and the material presented a ready opportunity for one a sinister genius whose visionary ways with technology is perhaps only approached by that of Nemo. That opposition alone could have provided a fertile rivalry. Its easy to imagine that had such a film been made in an earlier era the late 30s for instance when the limitations upon special effects would have forced the emphasis onto personal drama much more would have been made of the confluence of these colorful characters all of whom were Hollywood staples at one time or another. As it is they are competently realized on the outside but are given no inner life and few individualistic wrinkles. Quatermain is an all-purpose prince of the realm who resents the (slight) incursions of age; Nemo is a devout Hindu with pronounced anti-Brit sentiments; Skinner is almost as invisible dramatically as he is physically; Dorian Gray who is immortal as long as he doesnt peer upon his portrait is an unreliable dilettante when it comes to crime fighting; Harker is able to instigate bat attacks when needed; while Sawyer (who is never referred to as Tom onscreen) is the odd man out seemingly dragged in despite his limited talents just to have an American on board. Robinsons script is alive to the materials literary roots although there is a sense that the brakes have been applied so as not to push into territory perceived as too esoteric for American teenagers. All the characters are invested with a prideful dimension that makes them reluctant to share the stage with others of their stature and at least a couple of them are not without some wit about themselves. Some serve the storys purposes better than others and aside from Sawyer the Jekyll/Hyde creation is least successful mainly because the ungainly and heavily muscled Hyde resembles an unfortunate combination of the Hulk and Fat Bastard. Script is also gracefully unemphatic about its intentional prophetic side suggesting the conflict to come with WWI 15 years hence as well as the greater and more unimaginable horrors awaiting further along in the century without pretentiousness or self-importance. Except for a few clumsy perspectives of Venice toppling down effects are fun and beautiful to watch and pic is a visual treat with key contributions coming from lenser Dan Laustsen and costume designer Jacqueline West. Trevor Jones score rumbles with ominous vigor behind much of the action.
