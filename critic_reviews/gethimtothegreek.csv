The question of what happens if - like Ricky - it turns out he can only play one increasingly tiresome role is irrelevant for now we can all just rejoice in the fact that one of Londons most divisive idiosyncratic oddballs has scaled the heights of Tinseltown superstardom - reserving of course the right to point and jeer at him on the way back down.A British audiences enjoyment of Get Him to the Greek will depend entirely on their Brand tolerance those already sick of his incessant self-love and florid Victorian dandyisms should steer clear. Although Jonah Hill as the long-suffering record exec tasked with delivering Russells rock legend to the titular LA theatre may be the putative frontman this is Brands movie all the way hes the one snorting the drugs throwing the tantrums and getting the lions share of the laughs.And the laughs are big coupling the preening Britrock cliches of Spinal Tap with the edgy darkness of yuppie nightmare movies like Scorseses After Hours the film has a manic propulsive intensity that culminates in a series of excessive and hilarious comic setpieces. That it also has a big soft heart will come as no surprise to followers of the modern American man-com though Get Him to the Greek delivers a surprisingly raw thoughtful and gender-sensitive take on the obligatory aw-shucks ending. For now Russells rep seems secure.

"amyweekly >> Blog Archive >> Get Him to the Greek amyweekly Amy Nicholsons reviews and interviews << A Tyrants Tale Joan Rivers A Piece of Work >> Get Him to the Greek W.C. Fields warned ""Never work with children or animals."" Russell Brand and Jonah Hill can add ""Never work with P. Diddy."" When youre upstaged by a rap entrepreneur with no reputation for self-mockery fire your agent. This very loose spin-off of Forgetting Sarah Marshall stretches Brands Aldous Snow into the star of his own movie. In Marshall he was a smooth operator. Here hes at his nadir his last album (African Child) was called ""the worst thing to happen to Africa since slavery"" and longtime love Jackie Q (Rose Byrne) has dropped him for pop tart famedom and a series of rockers including Lars Ulrich in an unexpected cameo. Enter Hill as a nerdy record company intern--a straight man role that doesnt suit him--who Diddy entrusts to drag Brand from London to L.A. While the preeningly handsome rock star could carry a film writer-director Nicholas Stoller doesnt let him. Instead he trusts in booze drugs and tits edited into montages and repeated literally ad nauseum until Jonah Hill upchucks on his shirt. More than once. What passes for a punch line is ""Lets have some absinthe"" Stoller and co-writer Jason Segels disinterest in making their comic leads funny leaves a vacuum that only two people dare to fill. One is comedienne Carla Gallo who has a great go-for-broke scene as a Vegas stripper named Destiny. The other is Diddy who channels the worst of his reputation into music mogul Sergio Roma. Ruthless domineering deadly serious and willing to play dirty he gets a laugh with every line and makes it look effortless. Thats a technique Hill needs to consider as he drags his puke rags to the dry cleaners.

""Get Him to the Greek"" is the latest gross-out yuckfest from Team Apatow no better or worse than most of the others. Nicholas Stoller who directed ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" once again performs the honors and he resuscitates from that film its most memorable party animal - English rock star Aldous Snow played by Russell Brand without missing a beat. Jonah Hill the Everyman of Apatow Country plays the junior music executive whose job is to haul the drug-besotted Aldous from London to Los Angeles for his comeback concert. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Brand can seem simultaneously randy and strung-out and is often very funny. Hill is surprisingly touching which is quite a feat given the number of orifices he is required to display. It all gets sappy by the end and the sap all runs downhill.

By David Denby Russell Brand and Jonah Hill in a movie directed by Nicholas Stoller.   Credit Illustration by Rachel Domm In the brazenly funny ""Get Him to the Greek"" a Los Angeles music company gives one of its low-level employees a perilous task. Aaron Green (Jonah Hill) a polite rotund young man has to collect the once great now wasted rocker Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) from London and haul him to L.A. There at the Greek Theatre Aldous is scheduled to reprise a famous concert of ten years earlier--the company reasons that a comeback is something it can exploit. But Aldous has grown wary of performing and when Aaron shows up at his luxe apartment on the Thames he sizes him up as a nobody and starts to mess with him. He blows off flights rampages through pubs and gets the increasingly distraught Aaron drunk and most uncomfortably laid in the W.C. of a club. ""Greek"" is the story of how Aaron nevertheless gains control of his mission while Aldous stirred by Aarons decency and appalled by his own vacuousness begins to find some sort of core around which to rebuild himself. ""Greek"" was produced by Judd Apatow--the plot is Apatovian in its mixture of barbarity and tenderness--and there are many connections to earlier Apatow pictures. For a start Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller spun the characters out of their Apatow-produced movie ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" in which Brand first appeared as Aldous Snow and Hill played a waiter trying to impress him. For Stoller who directed both movies and wrote ""Greek"" the new movie is an enormous leap beyond that rather flabby comedy. Aaron is assaulted by nothing less than the past five decades of rock life concentrated distilled and savagely parodied. The movies story is conventional in shape but it has passages of crazy exhilaration and brilliant invention. Brand provides most of the fireworks. Anarchic nasty and unnervingly intelligent his Aldous has extraordinary reserves of energy and an endless repertory of temperaments and moods. Theres some real-world basis for this. Brand has been through a lot. He has joked about his childhood (he claims that his first words were ""Dont do that"") and at various times in his life he has been a drama student (expelled) a standup comic a radio host an alcoholic a heroin addict ""Shagger of the Year"" a soccer fan and columnist and an author. Apatow has said that ""Aldous is actually a toned-down version of Russell."" When we get our first glimpse of Brand in ""Sarah Marshall"" he looks like some sort of previously undiscovered wild animal. He has fiery dark eyes thickly draped black locks a dazzling snarl. In both movies he wears his shirt open to mid-chest and his pants skintight; hes both a strutting stud and a sendup of one over the top yet not too far over. Beneath the flamboyance is a frightened man on the verge of panic. ""Greek"" opens with a classic spoof. We see guerrillas firing at one another in a burning African village. What are these scary images? It turns out that theyre a music video and from the flames steps a tall figure white-robed and bearded Aldous playing Christ and staring beatifically at the camera. ""African child . . . trapped in me"" he moans as the battle seethes behind him. The song ""African Child"" came out a few years ago and was pounced on by critics as one of the worst calamities to befall the continent since plague and famine. Stoller gives us a rapid trek through Aldouss subsequent career disasters mocking magazine covers snarky Web sites hapless cable interviews. The filmmakers have caught the joyfully vicious tone of the celebrity culture in one of its periodic fits of contempt for an idol it had deliriously created. Aldous has a match of sorts in his ex-girlfriend Jackie Q (Rose Byrne) a British model turned singer her eyes decorated with teardrop glitter. We see some of her videos which are semi-obscene talentless provocations; the lame shock tactics are the only way that she can pitch herself to the public. Aldous and Jackie talk to each other in a drug-dazed filthy Brit babble that sounds like a degraded new stylization of speech. Theyre emptied out. Stoller has a terrific satirical ear for music-business bluster and sycophancy as well as for inane rock lyrics. Aarons boss Sergio Roma (Sean Combs) the head of Pinnacle Records subjects his staff to scathing tirades. (Combss comic timing is devastating; he should do more acting.) But he advises Aaron to flatter and even enable the hard-drinking rocker. How else can you control him? ""Party these Limey fucks to the ground"" is his considered advice. For stretches ""Greek"" with its music-world allusions and celebrity cameos moves recklessly fast. The party scenes jump ahead in the kind of quick-flash montage that I usually hate but I was amazed by how many scabrous and piquant details Stoller packs into each shot. Then the action collapses into exhaustion and disgust. Aaron parties Aldous to the ground all right but in Los Angeles Aldous invades the bed that Aaron shares with his girlfriend Daphne (Elisabeth Moss) a young doctor which is a little too close to the ground for Aarons taste. Apatow and his gang have turned hefty round-faced Jewish boys like Jonah Hill and Seth Rogen into romantic leads. That may be an outrage against the perfection of say Errol Flynn but one that we can be grateful for. At first Hill relies on the huffy hyperarticulateness that he has used in other roles but he calms down as the movie goes along. Aaron Green can handle Aldous Snow but hes disappointed when the rocker lonely and worn out lapses into self-pity. Aaron needs Aldous to be a hero just as Mark Linn-Baker needed a Flynn-like actor played by Peter OToole to be a hero in the lovely ""My Favorite Year"" back in 1982. ""Greek"" is a successor to that movie and to Apatows recent ""Funny People"" which was about the dark side of a life in comedy. The dark side of rock is a lot crazier but for Aldous performing again brings the elements of his scattered existence together. Apatovian comedy is both wild and firmly grounded; it surges into chaotic liberation and misadventure while longing for the bonds of loyalty friendship family and vocation. Every man in his own way has to return home. Jonah Hill turns up again in ""Cyrus"" but whereas in ""Greek"" he wears his hair in its customary fleecy aureole with a shadow of music-industry stubble here hes as clean-shaven as a deacon and his hair is tightly cropped. The change has the effect of making his eyes seem more pronounced his bulk larger his personality more aggressive. As Cyrus a twenty-one-year-old living with his single mother Molly (Marisa Tomei) Hill makes his lugubrious body work for him as a shield against experience. Cyrus has no interest in attracting girls; hes a nonsexual boy cloistered with the woman who raised him and whom he adores. At home with her he composes New Agey music on a flotilla of synthesizers. This possessive recluse is often unlikable but never stupid. Molly a generous-souled woman takes up with a forlorn long-divorced fellow John (John C. Reilly) and Cyrus who sees his hold over her threatened tries to break up the affair with lies guilt trips and mock breakdowns. Our sympathies of course lie with the lover. Reilly who has curly brown hair and rubbery features shreds his usual baffled sexlessness; his John begins to fight while Molly just tries to make everyone happy. ""Cyrus"" was written and directed by the brothers Jay and Mark Duplass who started out working in whats loosely called the mumblecore movement with no-budget pictures like ""The Puffy Chair"" (an absurdist road movie that turns serious about the end of a love affair) and ""Baghead"" (a kind of ""Blair Witch Project"" homage). This is their first film made with established actors and a decent budget yet they keep to their earlier aesthetic. They avoid the flash and the speed of commercial movies moving in close with a handheld camera and staying close as characters try to work out their confusion. The steady embrace of the actors produces intimate character details and awkward moments that land lightly with a touch of off-kilter humor. But the Duplasses have put themselves in a paradoxical situation the story of a sexually hungry boyfriend struggling against his lovers creepy son has the built-in volatility of a commercial-movie premise. When Cyrus and John square off the Duplass brothers might have turned in one of two directions toward wild comedy or toward anguish and rage. Theres a dose of the latter but the rage is quickly smothered in niceness and the movie becomes tame. Avoiding commercial formulas and whipped-up moods isnt enough to make a work of art. The Duplasses sensitivity which is genuine yields too much tepid relationship-speak and Marisa Tomei one of the most appealing actresses in Hollywood is left with little to play. The characterization of Molly as a sexy Earth Mother who cant speak her own mind is vapid and condescending as if she werent as real to the filmmakers as the two men are. The Duplass brothers rebellion might really take off if they put women at the center of it.

Aarons boss (a sidesplitting Sean Combs) charges him with getting Aldous from London to the Greek Theatre in L.A. for a comeback concert. Complications ensue. Dont they always? The big miss here is Jason Segel who wrote and starred in Sarah Marshall. Director Nicholas Stoller takes over the screenplay chores letting the air out of Segels balloon. Making Aldous regret his wicked ways is a buzz-kill of major proportions. Dont Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox.

Snow (Russell Brand left) makes life miserable for Green (Jonah Hill) in the Nicholas Stoller film Get Him to the Greek. Movie Review Get Him to the Greek Two leads carry all the weight but they get there Add to ... Stephen Cole The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 04 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Get Him to the Greek Directed by Nicholas Stoller Written by Nicholas Stoller and Jason Segel Starring Jonah Hill Russell Brand Elisabeth Moss Rose Byrne and Sean Combs Classification 14A First things first Relax there is no full frontal Jonah Hill nude scene in Get Him to the Greek a spin-off of Forgetting Sarah Marshall the 2008 comedy that established a new gold standard for male screen humiliation. Who can put aside that films most famous sequence where Sarah dumps boyfriend Peter just as he emerges from a shower naked and stuttering - all dangling parts and participles. Peter doesnt show up in the sequel and Sarah makes only a brief appearance. Instead we get to hang with Forgetting Sarah Marshalls memorable secondary characters. Russell Brand returns as Aldous Snow the always ""on"" British rock star. Stubbled beach ball Hill is also back and with a slightly better job. Last time he was a creepy bellhop; here hes Aaron Green a star-worshipping music-industry underling. Snow could certainly use some good PR help. The rocker is in tabloid hell His latest single African Child backfires when he has a John Lennon-were-bigger-than-Jesus moment referring to himself as an ""African white Christ from space."" The New Musical Express calls the song the worst thing to happen to Africa since apartheid. Girlfriend Jackie Q (Rose Byrne) dumps him on TV. Then Snow who has been sober for seven years drifts to a favourite hiding place altered space. Green wants to rescue his hero and his boss (Sean Combs) sends the junior record executive to London. His orders Bring Snow back preferably sedated to headline a comeback show at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles. What follows is often crazed fun. One scene has the rock star dribbling his beach-ball assistant through London nightclubs finishing him off with a shot of 18th-century Paris absinthe that has the poor kid hearing the old Turtles hit Happy Together in French. Through all this Snow is blissfully serene; the only sign of his pharmaceutical distress is a tongue that periodically escapes its moorings in search of skin salt. Another funny instructive sequence has the boys in an airplane that is almost as high as Snow. Aaron is frantic with worry - about the comeback tour his angry boss and his angrier girlfriend (Elizabeth Moss) back home. Snows advice in short Your life is too complicated. Me I only have to worry about one thing getting more drugs. Like producer Judd Apatows previous movies from his own Knocked Up and Funny People to Forgetting Sarah Marshall Get Him to the Greek is preoccupied with matters of loyalty and ambition in a showbiz context. Its also cheerfully profane in the manner of a dormitory bull session. And if the film doesnt quite have the resonance of Apatows best work it isnt the lead actors fault. Hill is sweet in a way weve never seen. His innocence prompts the marauding Snow to slow down and think lending charm and dramatic tension to what might have been a tediously eccentric comedy. Brand meanwhile is a one-man Spinal Tap with the faucet open wide. Hes even funny walking striding with shoulders flung back and head held high posing for adoring fans and photographers even when theyre not there. Whats missing in Get Him to the Greek are the supporting characters that made Forgetting Sarah Marshall so engaging. There are certainly no potential spin-off stories here. Sean Combs is a chore to watch as Aarons blustery boss. And none of Snows entourage or Aarons girlfriend are much fun either. If Aaron Green and Aldous Snow make any more rock n roll history heres hoping they show up with better sidemen.

Unless of course youre of the frat-boy demographic. So much then for judging a movie by its title -- or even its trailer. ""Greek"" starring hefty Jonah Hill and lithe Russell Brand is a veering careening joy ride of excess and heart. The Greek in this instance is Los Angeles legendary theater. The ""him"" is Brit rocker Aldous Snow (Brand) who after releasing a reviled single about Third World poverty has gone into a tailspin. Hes off the wagon. His love Jackie Q is off him. The guy tasked with getting Aldous from point A (London) to point B (L.A.) in three days is Aaron Green (Hill). Aaron is an ambitious yet honorable 24-year-old working for Pinnacle Records. In a roomful of yes-men and yes-women Aaron turns out to be a ""what about this?"" guy. He pitches the idea of an anniversary concert with Aldous Snow. And as played by Sean Combs who knows a thing or two about the recording industry Boss Sergio Roma is a shouter a belittler a guy who likes to mess with his employees minds. Hes very profane and often funny. He sends Aaron off on his fools errand. Sure the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. Of course theres little straight about Aarons journey. Nicholas Stoller of ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" directs this outing with loving verve. Rated R ""Greek"" is sweeter than it is crude -- and it is very crude. Once Aaron gets Aldous stateside theres a debacle of a side trip to Vegas the site of last years similarly styled comedy hit ""The Hangover."" Onscreen chemistry can be one of those elusive ""know it when you see it"" mysteries. Hill and Brand have it and they make for a deliciously Mutt-and-Jeff pairing. Manipulative and narcissistic Aldous in the grasp of another actor might be repellent. Brand makes him into a slim-hipped wonder. Of course Aldous is a rock star. (The movies original songs are silly -- and catchy.) Hes also a smiling wide-eyed man-puppy. Sure you want to roll up the newspaper and smack him on the muzzle but why? He makes you smile so. Man-puppies do the darndest things and this one does it all with a posh accent. Brand does some very odd and funny things with his tongue. Hes randy. Hes the tempting little devil whispering into Aarons ear. To his credit Aaron resists as best he can. And Hill is terrific swinging from conscientiously objecting to throwing his head back in party- time joy. Still Aldous is a veteran of the temptations he ushers Aaron into. There are drugs galore and not of the medicinal weed variety. Aldous Snow knows his blow his heroin his booze even his absinthe. Aaron doesnt. Dionysus in the leather pants 2; Aaron with the barf on his shoulder zip. ""Get Him to the Greek"" is cheeky about celebrity and pop cultures many absurd gestures. (Pink Meredith Vieira and Metallicas Lars Ulrich make cameo appearances.) In a scene of clueless self-import Aldous slithers his dance moves on a set meant to look like sub-Saharan Africa. In addition to the game hangers-on who Aldous introduces Aaron to there are some women of substance in ""Greek."" Aarons live-in girlfriend Daphne (Elisabeth Moss) is an overworked resident at an inner-city hospital who deflects Aarons amorous salvos with exhausted endearments. Shes drolly funny as she begins getting random phone calls from London. As comedic relationships go this one has an air of the possible. These two dig each other -- which doesnt mean theyll survive Aarons quest. Jackie Q is more a woman of substance abuse. And Rose Byrne (""Damages"") delivers an unexpectedly rich comedic turn as Aldous on-again off-again codependent lover and mother of his young son. Still Aaron and Aldous are the pair to root for. In a movie not shy about body parts they are the movies thumping pumping right and left ventricles. Film critic Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 or lkennedydenverpost.com.

The obstacles absinthe the Today show Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich Vegas and a Diddy-like music mogul played with gusto and uncharacteristic comic lunacy by Diddy. Movie Information Get Him to the GreekRatingShowtimes | Official siteDirector Nicholas StollerStarring Jonah Hill Russell Brand Diddy Rose Byrne Colm Meaney Lino Facioli and Lars UlrichRun time 169 minutesMPAA rating R (sexual content nudity drugs language)Synopsis Jonah Hill has to get Russell Brands faded rocker to a comeback concert. The taskmaster? Diddy.More movies from GuideLive.comAs you may have guessed Get Him to the Greek is unashamedly silly and that in addition to the above ingredients is its saving grace. No (or at least very few) moral lessons wedged into the ruckus like a misshapen crowbar. Wild tangents that wake things up just when theyre slowing down a little. Drinking and drugging sequences that dont just drink and drug but take the time to build gags and carry them through to anarchic glee.As you many have also guessed this is a Judd Apatow production (it is after all a new comedy) directed by his protege Nicholas Stoller ( Forgetting Sarah Marshall) and starring one of his favorite players the endearingly awkward Hill. Deadpan and plump Hill teams with the gangly ego-tastic Brand to form a walking sight gag a dervish of trouble that sweeps through clubs city streets airport terminals talk-show sets and other places where tamer souls are never safe.I can pinpoint the exact moment when Get Him to the Greek won me over. Aldous convinces Aaron to cut loose a little and try some absinthe the borderline hallucinogenic liquor made popular by the desperate merry-makers of fin de siecle Europe (and later if youre into headache-inducing movie musicals by Moulin Rouge ). Cut to whooping and dancing and then to multiple mini Diddy heads plastered in a pattern across the screen. One of the Diddy heads announces that hes going to eat the others and proceeds to do just that. If youre going to get crazy with a comedy you shouldnt half-step it which is the only lesson that Get Him to the Greek takes very seriously.Then theres his Royal Diddyness who has to be in on the joke as he berates record-label employees and sinks his teeth into an oversize version of himself. Its more than a cameo but Greek has an imaginative array of those as well. Nobel-winning economic columnist Paul Krugman? Welcome to your comedy career. Youll be seated with pop production whiz Pharrell former child star Rick ""Dont Call Me Ricky"" Schroeder and other potential scene-stealers. Its a Mad Mad Mad Mad movie.A little bit of Russell Brand can go a long way but Greek is a fine vehicle for his mock rock-god persona. Aldous is deluded into thinking everyone loves him as much as he does and his career has stalled under the weight of a hilariously ill-advised single called ""African Child"" (complete with a self-righteous video that delights in puncturing philanthropic pop posturing) and a failed marriage to a fellow pop star (Rose Byrne). Yeah we have to put up with Aldous inevitable development as a human being part of what little faux-seriousness Greek feels obligated to muster. Not coincidentally comedies have a way of sagging when they forget their mandate to be funny and Greek goes through some unfortunate flirtations with mush masquerading as plot.Try to tune it out. Wait for the next bit of absurdity. And try to remember that heroes come in all shapes sizes and purposes. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

Starring Jonah Hill Russell Brand Elisabeth Moss Rose Byrne Colm Meaney Sean P. Diddy Combs Director Nicholas Stoller Release Opened Jun 4 2010  Editorial Review A gag fest that fails to deliverBy Aaron LeitkoFriday June 4 2010TV spinoffs have a spotty record. ""Rhoda"" couldnt carry the torch for ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show."" ""Joey"" was a pale substitute for ""Friends."" Its rare that a previously established side character no matter how well loved can deliver the goods in his own show. Which is probably why nobody tries it with movies. Well nobody but the makers of ""Get Him to the Greek.""""Greek"" is a spinoff of sorts following the further exploits of hedonistic British rock star Aldous Snow last seen getting straight and sober in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall."" But Snow has fallen on hard times here. A well-intentioned but enormously offensive single ""African Child"" -- imagine Spinal Tap trying to write ""We Are the World"" -- has put his career into a nose-dive sent his girlfriend and child packing and caused him to relapse into substance abuse.In an effort to resurrect his public image the record company sends Aaron Green (Jonah Hill) an intern to escort him from London to a comeback gig at L.A.s Greek Theater. Green has his own problems too. Hes trying to salvage a foundering romance with his live-in girlfriend (""Mad Mens"" Elisabeth Moss) whos ready to settle down. But at Snows insistence this British assignment -- which should involve little more than an airplane meal and an in-flight movie -- devolves into a three-day bender. Rather than acting like a grown-up Green spends most of the film following Snow from party to party guzzling absinthe and hiding illicit substances in uncomfortable places.Like ""Marshall"" ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"" before it ""Greek"" subscribes to the man-boy monomyth structure invented by its producer Judd Apatow. You know where oafish but kindhearted guys are called to put aside childish ways and after having endured a certain amount of comic humiliation embrace adulthood.But the movie has trouble delivering on that formula. Unlike its forebears ""Greek"" lacks a truly sympathetic central character to hold things together when its time to get sappy. Russell Brands rock star -- a speech-slurring Keith Richards-meets-Noel Gallagher parody of excess -- feels like he dropped in from a ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch. Meanwhile as the record company lackey Hill is less straight man than human punching bag His romantic subplot is quickly buried under a hail of crude gags and body blows.""Greek"" wisely puts the sentimental stuff on hold for as long as possible delivering fake-out after fake-out -- including a botched father-son reunion for Snow and a particularly uncomfortable reconciliation for Green and his girlfriend. When the heartfelt resolution comes its tacked haphazardly onto the films final five minutes. And at that point why bother? The laughs worked well enough.Contains strong sexual content and drug use throughout and pervasive foul language. 109 minutes.

Photo (c)Universal/courtesy Everett / Ev A question once posed by rockers applies to the rock comedy ""Get Him to the Greek."" ""Who are you? Who who who who?"" Mostly this frantic film is yet another attempt at ""Spinal Tap"" silly. At times it goes for the heart of ""Almost Famous"" and its sense of rock is that of a barely acquainted observer. What else can you say about a movie that argues British rockers never die young -- and cites as examples members of the Rolling Stones whose guitarist came to rest at the bottom of a swimming pool at 27 and Led Zeppelin whose drummer ascended the stairway to heaven at 32? MORE WATCH THE FIRST 5 MINUTES OF GREEK MORE GREEKS FILTHY SONG Britains reigning mirth monster Russell Brand whose look was best described by critic James Parker as ""Chewbaccas girlfriend"" and who was dubbed ""Shagger of the Year"" by Britains Sun newspaper makes an overdue leading-man debut as Aldous Snow the hilarious rocker created by Jason Segel in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall."" Brand was born to do this but his character was sharper in his earlier supporting role and his arena-sized charisma this time is saddled with lots of sub-David St. Hubbins dialogue (""I slept with other people but always told her about it -- monogamy""). Aaron (Jonah Hill who seems to have gained the weight lost by his buddy Seth Rogen) is a flunky at a record label run by a tantrum-prone tycoon (Sean Combs who would have proven it long ago if he had any acting ability) who is sent from LA to London with orders to baby-sit Aldous and escort him first to New York for the ""Today"" show and then to a big concert at the Greek Theater in LA This is more a sketch idea than a feature-length plot -- why should we care whether he makes it? -- and Brands actual persona (as shown in his memoir ""My Booky Wook"") is far more impish and complicated than the druggy idiot he plays here. The movie needs an early scene showing Aldous being awesome to give us a rooting interest but when it attempts this after more than half an hour the song he does seems more like a Weird Al version of a rock tune (""We Got the Clap"") than an actual hit. The partying scenes begin to seem more madcap than funny particularly during a strenuous sequence in Las Vegas that involves the song ""Come on Eileen"" a furry wall hurled champagne bottles fire male rape via sex toy and heavy drugs. At the end of that I was tired and not from laughing. Some of the raunchy bits are amusing but others prove that funny doesnt automatically follow from dirty. But Brand and Hill are pure platinum and they play off each other as if theyve been working together for longer than Jagger and Richards. Whether theyre smashing each other with full garbage bags on the streets of New York exchanging life lessons (""I just feel like it couldnt hurt to not be on heroin"") or discussing Aldouss sex pistol (""This is the Emperor Release him"") they keep it lively. Combs also has some great dialogue (though a real actor -- say ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" star Craig Robinson could have stolen the show with it) and Elisabeth Moss of ""Mad Men"" is sweet as Hills doctor girlfriend. Shes the ideal choice to utter the demure line ""I would like to have a threesome please."" To sell his new friend on the idea Aldous tells Aaron ""Think of it as having sex with your girlfriend. While someone else also has sex with your girlfriend."" Writer-director Nicholas Stoller who also directed ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" a fact of which he reminds us with an incessant stream of in-jokes (dude It wasnt ""Citizen Kane"") has plenty of talent. But to beef up the story he should have written another movie kept the best half of it and interspersed that material with the funniest 50 percent of this one -- kinda how The Beatles came up with ""A Day in the Life."" kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Dad amp; grad Read Next Dad amp; grad Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 16323 How Hillary blew her big moment 9617 Malia Obama skipped the DNC for Lollapalooza 6874 NYC tourist duped into buying 1M worth of fake jewelry Now On Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary Jill and Joe Biden stop traffic on Fifth Avenue SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Starring Jonah Hill and Russell Brand. Directed by Nicholas Stoller. (R. 109 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The golden age of comedy - this new golden age which will only be apparent years from now when its over - continues with the release of ""Get Him to the Greek"" which is so comically fertile and yet so grounded in the reality of its characters that its really a kind of marvel. Its a culture-clash comedy an odd-couple comedy a road comedy and a comedy of discomfort about a very low-level record company executive assigned to escort a decadent rock star from London to New York and then on to Los Angeles Greek Theatre. The rock star (Russell Brand) is louche and blase utterly confident and completely uncaring about whether he gets there or not. And the young executive (Jonah Hill) is a nervous wreck desperate to make good on this task which will either make or break his career. So everything is in place The situation is high stakes. The characters are extreme but recognizable. (No one is made into a cartoon just for a quick laugh.) Finally it takes place within a specific world in this case the music industry which ""Greek"" mines for its rituals customs and modes of behavior. Either writer-director Nicholas Stoller (""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"") knows a lot about the music business or he fakes it exceptionally well. All this combines to make ""Get Him to the Greek"" very funny but also honest and true to its world. The days of the old Chevy Chase-type comedies in which people act silly just to get a laugh are over. Instead its possible to say of Russell Brand for example that he will have people laughing out loud but ultimately feeling for him as a lost soul that this is a dimensional portrait of a talented intelligent guy trapped in a spiral of celebrity loneliness and substance abuse. Whats more the movie allows us to come into this full understanding of the pop star without ever lurching artificially from comedy to sentiment. ""Get Him to the Greek"" is all of a piece and remains funny until the finish. The beauty of the film is that having put in place a solid comic structure Stoller keeps coming up with surefire comic situations. And so when young straight-arrow Aaron (Jonah Hill) finds himself in a limousine heading for the ""Today"" show with a rock star who absolutely must not arrive drunk or stoned what does he do when the rock star whips out drugs and alcohol? Aaron hogs the drugs and drinks all the alcohol and arrives on the set with vomit all over his own jacket. And on and on for 109 minutes just one absurd uncomfortable hysterical situation after another. Brand has the look and the authority of a celebrity as well as a quality that makes it hard to know when hes sincere and when hes putting people on or if he even remembers the difference. It wouldnt be surprising to see him considered for some critics awards at the end of the year. Jonah Hill in his most mature role to date is a good comic actor and ideal as a rational observer of the madness. As Aarons boss Sean ""P. Diddy"" Combs reveals himself as an abandoned verbal and physical comedian. Other pop stars show up in cameos as themselves. ""Get Him to the Greek"" is too funny to think about it much as it goes along. But when its over its instructive to look back and see how rich and detailed it is. We come away knowing about the rockers parents the strangeness of his interaction with his musician father (Colm Meaney) and his tortured (however satirical) relationship with his pop-star ex-lover (Rose Byrne). Also impressive is Elizabeth Moss (""Mad Men"") in a fairly straight role as Aarons girlfriend a medical intern. Moss conveys an interns exhaustion without resorting to the usual things like yawning or slurred speech. She suggests instead a wired scrambled mind. Enjoy it but afterward take a minute to appreciate it. To make a comedy this funny takes exceptionally smart people. -- Advisory Strong language nudity simulated sex lots of drug use.

ABOUT THE MOVIEGet Him to the Greek  1/2 (out of four)Stars Russell Brand Jonah Hill Sean Combs Rose Byrne Elisabeth MossDirector Nicholas StollerDistributor UniversalRating R for strong sexual content and drug use throughout and pervasive languageRunning time 1 hour 47 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Nothings quite as impure as the driven Aldous Snow. Snow the debauched has-been rocker in Get Him to the Greek is hellbent on abusing every substance possible in a matter of a few days and hooking up with every girl in the room. Its all about self-indulgence for the Brit singer despite the efforts of a record company flunkie to wrangle and corral him to the USA for a comeback concert. The concept is inspired and the movie has some very funny moments. But about halfway through this long weekend the frantic tale grows flimsy. The improvisational charm of Russell Brand as Snow becomes as weedily thin as the comic himself. VIDEO Watch the trailer Snows character originated in 2008s Forgetting Sarah Marshall. (In keeping with this summers derivative trend Greek is a quasi-sequel though Jonah Hill plays a different role here.) Brand was a scene stealer as the sexually voracious rock star boyfriend of the title character. Walking out of that movie you longed for more of Snow. This time Snow overstays his welcome like a washed-up entertainer who puts in one too many encores. He has you at allo but doesnt keep up the odd appeal as the final notes play out. Perhaps the problem lies in Snows character which is gratingly one-note. And theres only a whiff of chemistry between Brand and Hills Aaron Green the nerdy record company employee who pitches the idea of Snows concert. Sergio Aarons foul-mouthed boss is played with excellent comic timing by Sean Combs. Sergio gives the eager junior exec a seemingly simple assignment Fly to London collect Snow and bring him to New York for a stint on Today and to the concert at L.As Greek Theater. But nothing proceeds as planned. Greek has a bawdy screwball style with a distinct Judd Apatow influence. Apatow produced the film which was written and directed by Forgetting Sarah Marshalls Nicholas Stoller. But this comic road -- and air -- trip takes an unfortunate detour in Las Vegas where the humor falters. In Sin City bad boy Snow meets his estranged father (Colm Meaney). Their scenes together drag as does the final third of the movie. Some scenes are bawdily outrageous but the Snow expedition is a lot like Aldous himself whacked-out occasionally clever but in need of impulse control and direction.

"Get Him to the Greek (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Get Him to the Greek (R) Its funny enough but it hardly rocks. this film publicity image released by Universal Pictures Jonah Hill left and Russell Brand are shown in a scene from ""Get Him to the Greek."" (AP Photo/Universal Pictures Glen Wilson) Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald6/3/2010 Editor rating 2.5 In Get Him to the Greek actor Jonah Hill always a supporting player or co-star in so many other Judd Apatow comedies (Knocked Up Funny People Superbad) finally gets his starring role. He was funnier on the sidelines. Playing Aaron a low-ranking record company executive assigned by his boss (Sean Combs) to make sure the reckless rock star Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) is onstage when the curtain rises on his comeback concert Hill essentially plays the straight-man role and he suffers and sweats magnificently. Snow is a British rocker whose career went into the toilet after a stunningly ill-conceived music video but hes still partying and carrying on like Mick Jagger in 1969. Getting him from London to L.A. in three days will be a Herculean task involving lots of vomiting drugs and sex. A brash and raunchy take on 1982s My Favorite Year (in which a lowly writer was assigned to make sure a drunk Peter OToole showed up for a live TV appearance) Get Him to the Greek marks somewhat of a departure for producer Apatow and writer-director Nicholas Stoller (Forgetting Sarah Marshall) favoring gross-out antics and wild surreal excursions into nightclubs that make South Beach look like Dollywood. The volume is pitched high perhaps so you wont notice how lackadaisically structured the picture is. Get Him to the Greek isnt really a story but a collection of comic set pieces -- as if Apatow were atoning for his emphasis on character in Funny People which no one seemed to like. Brand a British comedian who has been edging his way into American movies (hes playing the same character here he played in Sarah Marshall) is OK in small doses but hes not charismatic or funny enough to carry a movie You tire of Snow and his antics quickly. Hill is better as the exasperated underling but hes outshone by a surprisingly funny Combs who brings a shading of pragmatism to his portrayal of the record-label chief who cares about nothing but the bottom line. Get Him to the Greek has some big laughs and it scores an endless source of points by skewering the rock-star lifestyle. The movie gets a little too sentimental for its own good in the last half-hour -- Stoller doesnt know how to leaven humor with drama gently the way Apatow does -- but the harm isnt fatal. The picture is crude slight and lingers in your memory about as long as a waft of bong smoke. The way this summer movie season is going though even the least bit of substance is enough to make a film feel like Citizen Kane.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 3 2010 636 PM Get Him to the Greek A buddy comedy that leaves out the buddy part. By Dana Stevens After youve seen Get Him to the Greek check out our Spoiler Special discussion You can also download the program  here or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed  via iTunes or directly with our  RSS feed. Get Him to the Greek As an entry in the emerging summer subgenre of ""boys behaving badly in order to become men who behave marginally better""Get Him to the Greek (Universal) had promise. Its loosely spun off from Forgetting Sarah Marshall a baggy but endearing 2008 comedy in which Jason Segels schlubby songwriter protagonist endured sexual humiliation and cuckoldry at the hands of a British rock star Aldous Snow (Russell Brand). In that film directed by Nicholas Stoller Jonah Hill had a small part as an obsequious waiter who hovered about Snow bedazzled by his aura of louche self-regard. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. In Get Him to the Greek also directed by Stoller Brand returns as Aldous Snow and Hill returns as a starry-eyed superfan--but a different starry-eyed superfan. Hes Aaron Green an A amp; R rep at a major record label thats desperately in search of the next big sound. Aarons boss the eccentric mogul Sergio (an enjoyably hammy Sean Combs) dispatches Aaron to London to baby-sit the hard-partying singer whose career has hit the skids since he publicly abandoned sobriety a few years back. Aaron has to get Aldous across the ocean to New York to record a Today Show segment then across the country to perform a sold-out show at the Greek Theater in L.A. On the way there Aldous and Aaron will bond they will barf they will squabble they will hallucinate and they just might learn a little bit about themselves. We on the other hand will learn next to nothing about them. Advertisement If this frantically paced buddy comedy had a motto it would have to be the one uttered by Spinal Taps glassy-eyed keyboardist near the end of This Is Spinal Tap ""Have a good time ... all the time."" Theres no buildup no narrative arc just one scene of comically debauched partying after another. The only shifts occur in the locale (London New York Las Vegas L.A.) and the substance being ingested champagne absinthe heroin and a joint thats laced with everything but the kitchen sink and innocuously nicknamed a ""Jeffrey."" Marathon revelry as a crucible for the forging of friendship is a time-honored trope both at the movies and in college. But you dont come to value a person just because the two of you get shitfaced together. You come to value them because you embark on ill-advised escapades share indiscreet confidences inadvertently hurt and then sloppily forgive one another ... while being shitfaced together. A good party movie understands this. But recent guys-on-the-town comedies like Get Him to the Greek--Id also include Hot Tub Time Machine and Superbad in this category--seem so keen to amp up the hurt that they neglect the part about forgiveness. Simply put Aldous Snow treats Aaron Green like dirt for the majority of the movie blithely endangering his job enlisting him as an addiction enabler (and in one highly unpleasant and implausible scene as a drug mule) and sabotaging his attempts to make amends with his sort-of-ex-girlfriend Daphne (Mad Mens Elisabeth Moss). Thats all standard bad-boy behavior and could make for a fine setup--if Aldous ever apologized or did a favor for the long-suffering Aaron whos so masochistic and passive that we ultimately lose patience with him too. Instead the movies emotional climax has Aldous bleeding in a hotel swimming pool as he bends Aarons ear about the loneliness of fame. This abrupt downshift from drug-fueled hijinks to maudlin confession is a lot to ask from an audience already wondering why we should care about either of these people. Until it chickened out with an unearned happy ending Judd Apatows Funny People was smart about the way famous entitled people lose their ability to navigate normal human relationships. The terrible things Adam Sandler did to Seth Rogen and others in that movie had real consequences. Aldouss misbehavior in the Apatow-produced Get Me to the Greek--and for fear of spoiling Ill just say that he violates Aaron in at least two pretty profound ways--is seen as charmingly dysfunctional at times even liberating. The movie closes on the image of Aldous Snow singing a new song ""Furry Walls"" that he wrote to commemorate the boys wild-party marathon. Its a goofy soaring anthem (co-written by Jason Segel) that makes the whole experience sound so much more fun than it actually was.

In the shaggily amusing but familiar and way-too-long Get Him to the Greek Aaron a no-level employee at a record label has been entrusted with shepherding a drugged-out Brit rock star named Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) to his big comeback concert at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles. As they stand in line at airport security before a flight from London to New York Aldous flexes his star status and insists his minder do him a favor that Aaron has just a few qualms about. (See the 50 best inventions.) Nothing unusual here. The hero of a traditional comedy is often confronted with tough decisions should he confess to the girl hes fallen in love with that hes already engaged or that hes a spy or a reporter or an alien? But Aarons problem is a bit more sensitive he has to decide whether hell stick a packet of heroin up his rectum so the notorious Aldous wont get caught with it. The security line is getting shorter; Aaron has no time to send a quick desperate note to the New York Times Ethicist column. Aldous is getting impatient he gives Aaron the curt command then tells him how to expel the item. ""Clench and sneeze."" (See TIMEs 76 things to do see and hear this summer.) Welcome back to the bizarro universe of Judd Apatow movies where everyday moral challenges are pushed to the comic extreme. The decision facing Aaron is one that troubles working stiffs anywhere what awful thing would I do to advance my career or simply keep my job? Later he undergoes the domestic equivalent of this option Will he accede to his girlfriend (Mad Mens Elizabeth Moss) in her desire to have a three-way with Aldous? Theres not much question about Aarons resolution of the drug-mule debate since Get Him to the Greek written and directed by Nicholas Stoller is a fond satire of the music biz -- and since one strategy of an Apatow-produced movie is to put the protagonist through the deepest pain and embarrassment. As in Clench and Sneeze. Ouch and Ewwww. For audiences Get Him to the Greek fits in the mid-comfort zone of Apatows discomfiting comedies. It features a smartly pugnacious and self-parodying turn by Sean Combs as the record label boss and visits by music icons Pink Christina Aguilera and Metallicas Lars Ulrich plus a cameo by another Times columnist -- a Nobel prize-winner whose reputation I wont stain by naming him. Hill looks to have expanded to Macys-parade balloon size since Superbad but plays the same prematurely middle-aged guy he did there. Brand best known for sadistic prank calls on BBC radio and bombing twice as MTV Music Video Awards host makes Aldous the engaging exasperating sort whos been getting his reckless way for decades. The movie also has an utterly extraneous get-blotto-in-Vegas sequence ostensibly to remind us that this time last year we all went to see The Hangover. Which Greek wont be. The movie is a sequel of sorts to Forgetting Sarah Marshall the sweet and funny Jason Segel ode to obsessive love Dracula puppet musicals and an actors need to show his penis. Aldous was a minor figure there -- the new beau of Segels ex -- and Stoller who directed Forgetting from Segals script expanded that character as the problem child and raging id of the new film. Greek is also a kind of remake of last years Funny People Apatows ambitious endless study of celebrity and its hapless satellites. In that one an aspiring comedy writer (Seth Rogen) becomes the caretaker of a top movie comic (Adam Sandler). Both films orchestrate the collision of a famous manic person -- essentially an overgrown child -- with a fairly decent schlub who serves as his babysitter and erratic moral compass. One difference In Funny People the Sandler character thought he had a fatal disease; here Aldous is more or less killing himself with booze drugs and a disastrous concept album called African Child. (Sorry guys Sacha Baron Cohen pretty much spiked that concept into the ground in last years Bruno.) Aldous doesnt really see himself in need of saving he subscribes to the received wisdom that you cant have rock n roll without sex and drugs. In fact the notion behind both films is that show people -- especially stand-up comics and rock stars who rely so crucially on aggression and sex obsession -- are not like the rest of us. To create their magic in public they need to act out in private. Aaron finally gets the message telling Aldous ""You make your insanity sound good."" Says Aldous ""Thats rock n roll."" True or not this idea isnt exactly late-breaking news; it has informed inside-Hollywood movies for generations from A Star Is Born to Tropic Thunder. The new one should be fast rude and with no redeeming ending. Yet a hallmark of the School of Apatow is a fourth act with lots of learning and hugging -- one reason his movies keep nearing or surpassing the dreaded two-hour limit. Speaking metaphorically mind you wed say theyre like Aaron at the airport the feel the need to insert a message some heart into the grubby comedy. They also need to make the mean-spirited guys weve enjoyed hating throughout the film people we can approve of at the end. But nobody goes to an R-rated man-love comedy for spiritual renewal. We just want more outlandish gags. Down with the uplift; up with the suppository jokes.

"Get Him to the Greek Between a rocker and a gross place | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesGet Him to the Greek Between a rocker and a gross placeGet Him to the Greek fits neatly into the classic mould of partnering two mooks from very different worlds and sending them on a zany journey of revelation and self-discovery.Jonah Hill left and Russell Brand star in Get Him to the Greek.  (SUBMITTED PHOTO)  By Bruce DeMaraEntertainment ReporterThu. June 3 2010Get Him to the Greek(out of 4)Starring Russell Brand Jonah Hill. Written and directed by Nicholas Stoller. 109 minutes. At major theatres. 14A Theres a well-established sub-genre in the realm of film called the ""buddy comedy"" and Get Him to the Greek fits neatly into the classic mould of partnering two mooks from very different worlds and sending them on a zany journey of revelation and self-discovery.Article Continued BelowSo the challenge then becomes how do you -- you as in writer/director Nicholas Stoller -- keep it fresh amusing and real in a way that taps the funny bone exhibits intelligence and arouses the requisite amount of pathos? Far too many buddy comedies dont put enough heart and brain power into the tale and fail miserably as a result.Stoller -- working under the auspices of the hip-and-smart comedy factory of producer Judd Apatow -- manages to avoid the main pratfalls of such a well-worn movie formula and Get Him to the Greek succeeds as a result.It seems to help that Stoller (Forgetting Sarah Marshall) is a peculiar blend of Anglo-American; born in London raised in Miami. It shows in Get Him to the Greeks blatant un-American-ness and that is actually a very good thing.Comedies emanating from the U.S. of similar ilk invariably suffer from a self-imposed conservatism that frankly restrains them. Greek to its credit is wonderfully unrestrained in its colourful use of profanity and in allowing comic situations to spring up and go off in unexpected and rewarding directions. To wit ""hooping"" (squeamishly amusing to all except to one particular individual) and menage-a-trois sex games that are squirmingly uncomfortable to the participants and riotously hilarious to us the voyeurs.It also helps to have a comic actor with the adeptness and talent of Russell Brand on hand reprising his role from Stollers Forgetting Sarah Marshall as aging mock-rock star Aldous Snow.Hes paired with a frumpy quasi-ingenu named Aaron Green (Jonah Hill) whois far from prepared to deal with the task of getting the washed-up rocker from London to a 10th-anniversary concert at the Greek Theatre many time zones away in L.A. One suspects Brand is channeling something close to his true self in his portrayal of Snow whose last big single ""African Child"" was brutally rejected by fans and smeared by critics (with good reason) as the ""worst thing to happen to Africa since apartheid.""As a result Snow is off the wagon big-time in terms of drug and alcohol consumption blithely unremorseful about past misdeeds and with enough sense of entitlement to still expect to be treated as a big star. In more reflective moments Snow is able to express the realization that his penchant for excess is really an attempt to escape from uncomfortable feelings of loneliness and disappointment. Hill is a good counterpoint a wide blue-eyed naif who has to learn quickly how to be a toadying sycophant who gets the job done without completely jettisoning his moral compass. Supporting performances bolster the whole including a juicy turn by Sean ""Puff Daddy-P Diddy"" Combs as manic super-cynical record company honcho Sergio. Rose Byrne as Snows ex Jackie Q. whose music inspirations rely rather heavily on sodomy and Colm Meaney as Snows estranged yob of an ex-manager also do well.Sure there are a few moments when pacing lags and others that would have been tweaked by a more assured director. But Stollers script has enough smart dialogue laughs and surprises that one could confidently expect to see Greek a second (or even a third) time again and find additional nuggets of hilarity within.Looking for a buddy comedy with wit heart and scatological charm to spare? Get thee to this Greek.

(Universal Pictures) Elizabeth Weitzman Wednesday June 2 2010 354 PM Title Get Him to the Greek ""Why cant everything be this simple?"" sighs Russell Brand while leaning quietly against the wall in ""Get Him to the Greek."" Of course its a fur wall in a psychedelic Vegas suite Brands drug-addicted rock star has been up for 48 hours straight and Sean Combs is about to come in and literally set the room on fire. But we grab our respites where we can.Speaking of which youd think itd be simple enough to find a movie that lets us check stress at the door makes us laugh all the way through and gives us more than our moneys worth by the end. Since its not a new film by Nicholas Stoller will always be welcome.Brand ran away with 2008s equally funny ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" also from Stoller and producer Judd Apatow.As preening rocker Aldous Snow the British comedian turned a minor character into a guy who deserved his own movie and - can it really be so easy? - thats just what he gets here.Two years later Snows star has dimmed and music exec Sergio (Sean Combs) is orchestrating a comeback concert. He taps underling Aaron (Jonah Hill) to escort Snow from London to the titular L.A. arena a task far more difficult than it sounds. Aarons into the rock n roll but Snows approach to sex and drugs could kill a lesser man.Really theres not much more to the movie than that eternal trinity as the men stumble from one outrageous party to another. But aside from the useless gross-out scenes Stoller and a perfectly tuned Brand get every detail right including the seductive egomania of celebrities and the predatory fawning of their handlers.This is very much Brands movie with Hill playing a surprisingly subdued straight man. Still the strong supporting cast - including Rose Byrne and Elisabeth Moss as the guys girlfriends - easily holds its own.

"Movie review Get Him to the Greek - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Russell_brandMovie review Get Him to the GreekThe films funny and compelling moments are overshadowed by all the raunchiness. Russell Brand and Jonah Hill star.June 04 2010|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Theres a lot of bad behavior going down in the new raunch comedy ""Get Him to the Greek"" and Im not even talking about Russell Brands off-the-wagon rock renegade who requires 24-hour minding from Jonah Hills nebbishy record-label flunky either. The seriously out-of-control hard R dude is writer-director Nicholas Stoller who apparently has major trust issues with his odd-couple stars women and the audience. Did I forget anybody? Its too bad too because there are both very funny and surprisingly compelling narrative themes running through the film that would have worked even better if a and get ready there are a lot of ifs a (a) the "" F-bombs"" were occasional rather than unrelenting (b) ""Mad Mens"" talented Elisabeth Moss wasnt completely misused (c) there was far less projectile vomiting (d) there were fewer ""objects"" shoved up Hills bum and (e) the masochistic misogyny had been shelved entirely. The premise is a simple one Unreliable rocker Aldous Snow (Brand) has 72 hours to get from London to the Greek Theatre in L.A. for a 10-year-anniversary gig designed to recharge his career and his record label. Sean ""Diddy"" Combs Sergio is in charge of the record business with Hills Aaron Green the innocent sent abroad to make sure Aldous makes it to L.A. Mayhem ensues. Aldous first turned up as one of the funniest bits in 2008s "" Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" also directed by Stoller. And though ""Greek"" is not a sequel in the traditional sense Brands character is a replica of his seven-years-sober rock star who stole Sarahs heart. Meanwhile Hills Snow-adoring waiter has been given a new life entirely and a career upgrade to rock industry intern though considering the music business flagging fortunes Im not sure it would pay any more. ( Kristen Bell was Sarah and returns in ""Greek"" as one of the best in a string of cameos the movie throws in as sight gags.) In Brands case looks are if not everything then a lot. Between the prowl and bizarre body lines that echo Mick Jagger and an introspective comic irony a la Bill Murray Brand is seductive to watch as he vamps his way across the various stages here both public and private working the hair-tossing insouciant artist thing to excellent effect. But amid the laughs and there are plenty the actor brings an unexpected authenticity to Aldous struggle with sobriety fame his parasitic parents and the loss of the love of his life Jackie Q (Rose Byrne) whos taken their son and left. Hill like the film itself takes awhile to get warmed up. The brainstorming session in which Aaron first offers up the Greek idea is as much as anything a forum to let Combs play a foul-mouthed record mogul which is funny for about three seconds before it just gets tedious. Aarons ball-and-chain is Moss Daphne a medical student whose desire for a normal life is dragging him down. Moss is basically asked to be serious and seriously grating and soon their nonrelationship is on the skids for reasons that really dont matter. At least not to Stoller whos interested only in the chance to go crazy with the makeup sex turning it into a threesome with Aldous that is so out of character for the bit of character Moss has been given its just uncomfortable to watch. There are other badly played voyeuristic moments a more of the attack brand of comedy than the self-inflicted fun found in ""The Hangover"" last years summer sensation a that Im betting will be too much even for the adolescent gross-out side of the male cerebral cortex the film is squarely aimed at. There is a particularly egregious rape scene that involves a humiliated Aaron a cant we just agree going forward that no matter who the victim is rape jokes never work? Hill brings his inner nerd to the party again only a slight variation on the character that he was doing long before his ""Superbad"" breakout in 2007. Still he is much funnier playing the ugly duckling downing bottles of Jack Daniels to keep his rock star on track than the romantic foil. Its a regrettable characteristic of nearly all of the films with the Judd Apatow imprint (hes a producer on the film and Stoller has been part of his comedy brat pack since the ""Undeclared"" days when both the girls and the comedy were sweeter) that the only women around are women men love to hate and ""Greek"" is no exception. To a woman they are too emotionally thin to resonate with any measure of reality and all come with a castrating mean streak that seems a prerequisite. Youd think the boys would use some of the bundles of money they make on the films for some therapy. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESMovie review The TempestDecember 10 2010Sean Combs looks to establish a good comedy rap with Get...June 3 2010The actors Jonah HillMay 2 2010Joker as a rocker godJune 14 2008MORE STORIES ABOUTRussell_brandRussell BrandGreek TheatreJonah HillCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-greek-20100604,0,1898267.story",200,gethimtothegreek22,gethimtothegreek,latimes

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Get Him to the Greek"" is hormonal anarchic fun. Its a Judd Apatow production a sort of sequel to ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" the raunchy romantic comedy where we first encountered Russell Brand as debauched rock star Aldous Snow. Like the best Apatow films this follow-up ties your emotions into the characters while your mind reels in convulsions of joy. Jonah Hill plays Aaron Green a low-level record-label exec about to settle into premature middle age. With his baby face and carefully cultivated stubble hes anxious young adulthood incarnate. He lives with his girlfriend a physician who returns from her residency shifts too exhausted to do anything but give him a goodnight peck on the forehead. Aaron who has always been his circles designated driver channels his rebellious tendencies into his love of rock. When he recommends that his record label re-stage Snows triumphant 2000 concert at L.A.s Greek Theater hes assigned to chaperone the dissipated rocker on the three-day trip from London. For Snow coming off a monumentally insensitive African concept album -- ""the worst thing to happen to Africa since apartheid""-- the concert is an offer he cant refuse. Superstar ego being what it is hell make the trip only on his own terms. As a fading rocker finally running out of sycophants and facing the rigors of marriage children and addiction he has some urgent growing up to do. But hes stuck at a point where whatever the challenge the only logical course of action is getting wasted or getting laid or -- ideally -- both. When the worried career-obsessed nebbish and the wise-ass hedonist collide the rocker hijacks his baby sitter and the expected sex-drugs-and-drink shenanigans occur. Aaron is humiliated at every turn. Hes forced to act as Aldous drug mule at the airport chugs the rockers intoxicants so he doesnt arrive at a ""Today Show"" interview stoned and even enables him in a funny-squirmy sexual encounter. What raises this movie above comedies of misbehavior like ""The Hangover"" and ""MacGruber"" is the notion that each of the characters has something to offer the other. Aaron expects more from his hero than sarcasm cruelty self-indulgence and torpor. In turn Aldous rescues his music-nerd wingman from a life of smooth polite embalmed perfection. Brand has a ball with Aldous who camouflages his decadence as woolly live-in-the-moment idealism. A reunion with his father a resentful absentee musician sharply played by Colm Meaney explains why Aldous needs to stand onstage being idolized by strangers. In the British style Brand is willing to expose himself to merciless mockery excusing none of his characters faults. Hills role as Aaron isnt such a showboat part but he makes the hapless nerd appealing. We see him veering into a life that could be a no-fun grind and we root for him to escape that fate. The surprise of the film is Sean ""P. Diddy"" Combs as the record-company owner. Introduced as a stock character the hot-tempered boss he keeps popping up in the story gaining new comic dimensions with every appearance. Add in a cavalcade of inspired show-business cameos and a slew of funny mock rock anthems (""Weve Got the Clap"" -- everybody sing) and you have proof that broad comedy is not necessarily dumb comedy. GET HIM TO THE GREEK  out of 4 stars Rating R for strong sexual content and drug use throughout and pervasive language.

Snow is a fading rock musician with big appetites for booze and drugs Greenberg a music executive and fan who tries to boost Snows career.By Carrie Rickey Inquirer Movie CriticPosted June 04 2010How to put this politely? Though frequently riotous Get Him to the Greek the Forgetting Sarah Marshall spin-off with Russell Brand and Jonah Hill reprising their characters as shaggy British rocker Aldous Snow and his fawning fan is Hamburger Helper with more helper than hamburger. This time the supporting players are the stars.Yet even while these secondary figures dont fully rise to leading-man dimensions the film succeeds as a music-industry satire a very naughty version of Almost Famous. This time the fanboy does not write the legend of the rocker but restores him to former glory. Call their misadventures - which involve more sex drugs and rock-and-roll than Keith Richards indulged in during his debauched days - Almost Infamous.Resembling a Goth Willy Wonka Aldous - who once topped the charts with his album Infant Sorrow - releases a new album African Child. Promptly it is denounced as the worst thing to hit that continent since apartheid. After the bad reviews and the breakup with his Spice Girl-type wife Jackie Q (Rose Byrne) Aldous hits the skids and the bottle.Back in Los Angeles music-industry executive Sergio Roma (P. Diddy unexpectedly funny) is about to cut Aldous loose. Then Aaron (Hill) a puppyish junior exec at the label suggests mounting a comeback concert on the 10th anniversary of Aldous celebrated live show.Now all they have to do is get Aldous who drinks his weight in beer every morning and consumes heroin like cornflakes from London to Los Angeles Greek Theatre for the gig. Hence the films title.Director Nicholas Stoller (who likewise helmed Sarah Marshall and is a charter member of the Judd Apatow fraternity) ticks off the differences of this mismatched duo for Laurel-and-Hardy comic effect.Aldous is lean as a string bean; Aaron round as a doughnut. Aldous is a loose cannon; Aaron is firmly anchored. Aldous has no emotional ties; Aaron has a live-in girlfriend (Elisabeth Moss a medical resident).Predictably this study in excess and moderation crashes like particles in a comic Supercollider over their 72-hour power struggle set in the self-contained universe of NBC/Universal. (Many of the films pivotal scenes cross-promote the corporate brands. After a wild plane ride from London Aaron gets Aldous to NBCs The Today Show where a baffled Meredith Vieira surveys the damaged duo. Monitoring his star and assistant by cell Sergio watches NBCs The Biggest Loser. The Greek Theatre itself is a venue owned and operated by Universal Studios.)Except for a sequence in Las Vegas involving a wall upholstered with fur the scenes between Aldous and Aaron are never as funny as those between the men and their women. Delicate as she is prickly Byrnes Jackie works her English-rose beauty to entice and punish Aldous. And as Daphne Moss (best known from Mad Men) so self-possessed with Aaron is comically flustered in the face of Aldous debauched logic delivered in his irresistible singsong.Great? No. Great fun? Oh yes. Like Sergio and Aldous this movie messes with your mind then tickles it.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

This years model is ""Get Him to the Greek a raucous rowdy good time that betrays its corporate rock n and roll heart by going soft in the last half-hour. But if the movies all too predictable in its broad outlines its scurrilously funny in the details and it pushes its two leads and one of its supporting actors in entertainingly fresh directions. For early June thats enough.""Greek is also a sequel of sorts. In 2008s ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall Russell Brand the lanky loose-jawed bad boy of British tabloids played the role of Aldous Snow a lanky loose-jawed bad boy of British rock. Brand was so unexpectedly hilarious -- to US audiences anyway -- that his character has been turned up to 11 for this film written and directed by ""Marshall helmer Nicholas Stoller.Aldous is in a pickle. His latest single a hugely misconceived act of rock-star charity-mongering called ""African Child has been called ""the worst thing to happen to Africa since apartheid. His wife a bubbleheaded pop star named Jackie Q (Rose Byrne) -- Lady Gaga without the good taste -- has left him and seen her career soar. He has fallen spectacularly off the wagon into a mountain of pharmaceuticals. What to do?Aaron Green (Jonah Hill) has the solution. A longtime Snow fan and low-level flunky at Pinnacle Records he convinces his boss Sergio (Sean Combs) to arrange a concert at LAs Greek Theatre the site of the rockers greatest triumph 10 years earlier. Itll be broadcast internationally and preceded by a ""Today show appearance and all Aaron has to do is baby-sit Aldous from London to New York to Los Angeles.The movie thus plays as the collision of two cartoon characters Hapless fatty meets wily beanpole or Abbott and Costello get Tourettes syndrome and a trunk full of drugs. This marks the first time Hill has been asked to carry a movie and the actor tones down the antic loudmouth shtick from films like ""Superbad. He even gets a girlfriend a chirpy medical student named Daphne (Elisabeth Moss) whose hours are driving him crazy with loneliness and sexual frustration.In any event Aldous is the anarchic pleasure principle of this duo and most of the fun in ""Get Him to the Greek consists of watching the absurdly charismatic Snow seduce Aaron into one outstanding debauch after another. Most of the dialogue cant be printed in a family newspaper but Brands tone really is something special Aldous wheedles and chides lazily talking Aaron into say putting a balloon full of heroin into a particular body cavity in partial view of airport security. Above all Aldous is or sounds logical. Scolded for his recreational drug use he patiently insists ""Its not recreational -- its not meant to be a hobby.The specific events in ""Get Him to the Greek arent very important. The fun while it lasts is in the finely tuned timing and the way the movie keeps popping out surprise guests playing themselves. This is the last place Id expect to find economist Paul Krugman or Metallica drummer/heavy-metal neurotic Lars Ulrich but here they are one in the ""Today show green room and the other in Jackie Qs bed.The genuine surprise is Combs. Whod have guessed P. Diddy steals a movie What begins as a smallish guest role -- a supremely vulgar record-label head cowing his minions while looking to ""thicken the revenue stream -- keeps growing until Sergio has become Aarons on-call guru in the care and feeding of infantile rock stars. The movie builds to a delirious high in which Aldous Sergio and the rockers seedy ex-manager father (Colm Meaney) try to violently psych each other out in a hotel suite thats on fire and you realize with a shock that Combs is the funniest person in the room.""Get Him to the Greek cant help losing its groove after that. The final act plays it safe raising and rejecting the possibility that sweet little Daphne might be randier than Aaron considered and setting up a mushy brotherly redemption for the rocker and his minder. Which I guess is always the way of mainstream Hollywood preaching rawk n roll rebellion before tucking audiences and their morals back into bed. I still say a dull Aldous Snow serves no earthly purpose. We already have Bono.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2010 Globe Newspaper Company. Thought you might like ...

Share Tweet As Aldous Snow the breakout character in Forgetting Sarah Marshall Russell Brand was a glorious amalgam of rock-star stereotypes A creature of colossal excess despite his loose attachments to Eastern philosophy and vague ""causes"" a thinker as vapid and pretentious as Sting or Bono on their worst days and a tornado that rips through hotel rooms and other peoples relationships. At the same time he was also a manifestation of Sarah Marshall star Jason Segels worst nightmare underlining the shortcomings of a man who cant measure up to a pansexual rock deity who looks annoyingly at ease in leather pants. So the question facing the spinoff comedy Get Him To The Greek isnt whether Brand is funny in the role--he was and he remains--but whether he can exist on his own without a poor schlub like Segel to torment. Writer-director Nicholas Stoller who also directed Sarah Marshall cleverly gets around the problem by producing another poor schlub in the form of Jonah Hill whos weirdly not reprising his role as a sycophantic hotel staffer in the earlier film. Here Hill plays a Los Angeles record company lackey who comes up with the idea of reviving Brands career which has stalled in the wake of a single ""African Child"" that critics dubbed the worst thing to happen to the continent since apartheid. Hills initiative backfires when his boss (Sean ""Diddy"" Combs in hilariously dictatorial Making The Band mode) tasks him with escorting Brand from his home in London to the Greek Theater in L.A. to kick off the tour. Though some of the novelty of the Aldous Snow character is gone--the ""African Child"" video for one is a faintly amusing echo of his Dylan-esque ""Weve Got To Do Something"" clip from Sarah Marshall--Brand expands on the rascally charm and soul that made him transcend type in the first film. And Hill dialing back on the pissy vulgarity of his supporting roles in Knocked Up and Funny People makes the perfect foil as passive and impressionable as Brand is reckless and impulsive. Both have some growing-up to do--this being a Judd Apatow production after all--but a few squishy reconciliation scenes dont take away much from the ramshackle road-movie hijinks. Theyre the mild hangover from a wild night. Share Tweet Filed Under Film More Movie Review Previous Movie Review Splice Next Movie Review Killers Dont miss a story--follow The A.V.

Get Him to the Greek from the same producer/director team stars Brand in a reprise of his Sarah Marshall role and Hill who plays an entirely new character. This is one indication that maintaining narrative logic was not a primary goal in the production of Greek a mash-up of what have become the stock tropes of the modern male-oriented comedy in which socially awkward guys presented with easy opportunities for indulgence in sex and mind-altering substances long to crawl back into the womb or return to a house-training ex-girlfriend -- whatevers easier.Hill plays Aaron a cubicle jockey at a record company in desperate need of a cash cow. Mogul CEO Sergio (Sean Combs) has his hopes pinned on a new rap single (chorus ""Gonna fuck that shit/gonna knock up your bitch"") but Aaron has a more ambitious suggestion Why not mount a comeback gig for Aldous Snow celebrating the 10th anniversary of his band Infant Sorrows legendary show at the Greek Theater?Snow hasnt performed live in three years. A montage of clips and headlines from commercial scandal mills like Extra TMZ and Perez Hilton clues us in to his recent career slide precipitated by a disastrous attempt at a do-gooder record ""African Child"" the video for which has Snow in Christ mode wandering a war zone and giving birth to a black infant. After getting dumped by his back-on-the-bottle baby mama on national TV Snow rehabbed his career (and gave the gleeful tabloids much grist) by spectacularly falling off the wagon. With Snow a hot commodity again thanks to his self-destructive extracurricular activities imagine how much money could be made if he were to actually do his job? And so Sergio dispatches Aaron to London where he is to pick up the perma-trashed star escort him to New York for an appearance on The Today Show and then follow the directive of the films title in time for a sold-out concert in Griffith Park.As in other recent wild-ride comedies (such as The Hangover and the Harold and Kumar enterprise) Greeks plot is nonsensical -- Sergio claims to own ""21 Koo Koo Roos"" but he doesnt have a private jet he can send to expedite the rock-star wrangling? -- the mission just a limp hanger for a series of stoney ostensibly unhinged set pieces. From the masculinity-threatening encounters with hot female tops (shades of Superbad) to the male-bonding-via-hallucinogens montages (shades of pretty much every comedy targeted to young men over the last two decades) most of Greeks gags are too familiar to be funny. The fake songs written for the film are the most reliable source of comedy but the music has its own logic problem. Both the songs coded as bad (""African Child"") and the songs coded as good (""The Clap"" which like most of Snows hit ditties directly addresses venereal disease and/or his dick) play like Weird Al compositions Theyre all convincing approximations of real pop music with parody lyrics. This dilutes the closest thing Greek has to subtext a celebration of the authentic power of rock in a beyond-superficial pop landscape. Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm Greeks confused cultural critique almost looks sharp next to its tired sexual politics which as with most Apatow factory films suggest that masculinity is a sham. Snow all unrestrained id in Marshall is revealed in Greek to be desperate for domesticity and its contagious -- after three days in his company the nebbishy Aaron learns hes lucky to be whipped by his own doctor girlfriend (Elizabeth Moss). Film critics bloggers and other arbiters of cultural taste bloodthirstily bash the Sex and the City films for indulging in and promoting unrealistic fantasies (that urbane libidinally liberated ladies really want a man to take care of them; that older women could be successful sexual aggressors). Greek in the current tradition of Hollywood bromances traffics in a general fear of sex ultimately suggesting that the only thing men really want is a woman wholl take care of them. Its the same fairy tale with the genders flipped.For all the flaws of films like The 40-Year-Old Virgin or Funny People theres no question that Apatows directorial efforts are the work of an auteur with a unique cohesive and coherent vision. The sexual conservatism in his stories at least feels like its in context -- male sexual panic is in a way Apatows signature fetish. His films purport to showcase the wild and crazy adventures of boys behaving badly but when given the opportunity to break free and indulge all of their supposed fantasies the guys freak out and embrace the domestic relationships that supposedly constrained them.This theme has bled into productions made by Apatow proteges as well as filmmakers outside his jurisdiction (see The Hangovers desperate final-act thumbs-up to matrimony) but not everyone can pull it off. Greek as directed by Nicholas Stoller feels slopped together according to the Apatow Productions schematic but its late-inning morality lacks organic purpose and rings false -- this is remember a film about a rock star whose brand is depravity. Under Apatows direction when boys move beyond their base desires its character development. Under Stollers its a buzzkill. Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

"Get Him to the Greek | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; get-him-to-the-greek ) Get Him to the Greek (United States 2010) June 01 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli In the midst of the testosterone and special effects that dominated the 2009 summer box office along came a raunchy comedy called The Hangover that not only became one of the years biggest hits but re-affirmed that there is a place for rude crude lewd motion pictures. Sadly in the nearly one year gap since the release of The Hangover the various coattail-riding R-rated comedies arriving in theaters have been universally disappointing unfunny tedious and sometimes hard to watch. Leave it to Aldous Snow to change the trend. Back from his dalliance with Sarah Marshall Snow (played by Russell Brand) gets an opportunity to headline his own movie and Get Him to the Greek turns out to be the funniest hard-R comedy since The Hangover. Judd Apatows magic touch challenged for the first time with Funny People has been restored with Get Him to the Greek. However Apatow is only producing here. This is the child of Nicholas Stoller who is both writer and director. Stoller whose sole previous behind-the-camera credit is Forgetting Sarah Marshall elected to spin-off this movie for Forgetting Sarah Marshalls most eccentric character rocker and partier Snow. With the exception of a fleeting blink-and-youll-miss-it cameo for Kristen Bell as Sarah Marshall Snow it the only returning character. Get Him to the Greeks other star Jonah Hill also appeared in Forgetting Sarah Marshall but as a different character than the one he essays here. As with all films bearing Apatows name in some capacity Get Him to the Greek isnt all about belly laughs although there are plenty of those to be sure - some of which are so loud that whole passages of dialogue are drowned out by audience-wide explosions of mirth. Theres a poignant aspect to the story that injects an element of human drama. Snow who was a living breathing caricature in Forgetting Sarah Marshall develops into a three-dimensional individual here. He drinks and does drugs to numb the pain of having lost the love of his life (Jackie Q played by Rose Byrne) and having been used as a meal ticket by his father (Colm Meaney). The unlikely bond he forms with recording company suit Aaron Green (Jonah Hill) occurs because he has no one else. The storyline is straightforward Aaron is dispatched by his boss Sergio Roma (Sean Combs a.k.a. P. Diddy) to fly to London and chaperone Snow to Los Angeles where he is scheduled to perform a concert at the Greek Theater commemorating the tenth anniversary his careers apex. Snow is more interested in partying drinking and doing heroin than in traveling and his attitude begins to infect the strait-laced Aaron whose spine is made of malleable stuff. From the U.K. to New York to Las Vegas to Los Angeles the two spar and bond as they attempt to make it to the Greek on time. Although the movie contains a few heartfelt (and in one case heartbreaking) scenes it is predominantly a comedy and never forgets that. Momentum flags a little during the final 20 minutes or so; the comedic climax occurs during a madcap sequence in Vegas that features drugs the stroking of soft fur a fire a chase and ""Come on Eileen"" by Dexys Midnight Runners. Jonah Hill is Jonah Hill and Russell Brand is Russell Brand. Neither breaks new ground; they are pretty much what one expects them to be - Brand the off-the-wall lunatic and Hill the baby-faced doofus in a suit. This can be good news or bad news depending on your opinion of the two performers. Those who dont appreciate what Hill and Brand bring to the production may find Get Him to the Greek tough going. But if youre willing to forgive Brand his prank on Andrew Sachs and take him at face value his vein of humor enlivens the film and Hill is the perfect foil. Get Him to the Greek is in many ways the modern equivalent of a very old staple the buddy movie/road trip. On the acting side if theres a surprise it comes from P. Diddy who displays a surprising aptitude for comedy. Even when sharing the camera with Hill and Brand Diddy never backs down. In fact theres ample support to back the assertion that he is the comedic highlight of the movie. Despite being a spin-off from Forgetting Sarah Marshall familiarity with the earlier film is not a prerequisite for enjoying Get Him to the Greek. Like most movies that come out of the Apatow factory this one demands an open mind a willingness to laugh at the obscene and profane and an understanding that comedy can sometimes be peppered with tragedy. Get Him to the Greek is not perfect but it works better than one might assume from the juvenile and lackluster preview.

Diddy Combs; Director Nicholas Stoller; Author Nicholas Stoller; Release Date Wide 06/04/2010; Runtime (in minutes) 109; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Universal Posted June 4 2010 -- 1200 AM EDT Its not every day that a movie performance is so funny and indelible it earns its own spin-off. In Get Him to the Greek the flamboyant British actor-comedian Russell Brand resurrects his character from Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008) a fantastically narcissistic and dissolute rock star named Aldous Snow. Aldous like Brand himself has a mop of tangly black hair a saintly gaze and an aristocratic love-me pout that combine to make him look like Jesus of East London. Hes a magnificent rocky-horror wastrel. Aldous walk is somewhere between a slither and a lurch and he talks in a Cockney singsong so cheerfully oblivious that at first you may think hes Spinal Tap dim. Yet every word that spews out of Aldous head has its own uncanny egotistical logic. (""Dont think of it as a threesome"" he explains to an overly cautious acquaintance. ""Think of it as having sex with your girlfriend while someone else also has sex with your girlfriend."") Aaron a lowly record company intern played by Jonah Hill has 72 hours to shepherd Aldous from London to New York where he is set to appear on Today and then on to Los Angeles where hes scheduled to do a comeback concert at the Greek Theater on the 10th anniversary of his last triumphant appearance there. If the gig is a success hell dispel the stench of ""Africas Child"" his incredibly condescending bomb of a single that sent his career into a druggy tailspin. Get Him to the Greek has a conventional After Hours one-calamity-after-another setup. Except that the detours and disasters all grow directly out of Aldous personality as he invites Aaron to share the live-for-the-moment excess of the rock-star lifestyle. The films director Nicholas Stoller (who also helmed Forgetting Sarah Marshall) knows that the real pleasure of rock-star decadence isnt just the drugs or the sex. Its the hanging around -- the doing whatever you want to do right into the morning after. Dance-club marathons joints laced with every illegal substance on earth sex in bathroom stalls lots and lots of puking Aaron experiences it all including (hilariously) being forced to act as an impromptu drug mule. Yet the movie isnt staged in an excessive way. It has a rambly realistic tone with one orgiastic mishap spilling into the next and that tone keeps much of the action popping with surprise. Jonah Hill now looks like the unhealthiest actor on the planet but he wears his rotund shape lightly rather than letting it wear him. In Get Him to the Greek Aaron has way too much of a good time but Hill with his low-key sincerity keeps you rooting for him; hes a schlemiel whos always a bit reassuringly cooler than you expect. Mad Mens Elizabeth Moss as his live-in girlfriend makes her workaday prickliness convincing and Sean Combs as Aarons boss gets to go entertainingly apoplectic. Get Him to the Greek is a clever rock-world satire with some lively take-offs on the TMZ-gossip magazine circus but its also too long and by the time of the inevitable Las Vegas sequence it starts to grow repetitive. The movie isnt in the end in the top drawer of Judd Apatow productions as Forgetting Sarah Marshall was. Its closer to a more flaked-out (and interesting) Pineapple Express. Aldous Snow was actually more hilarious when he had less time on screen. As indelible as Russell Brand is in the role Im not sure that the character really benefited from being given daddy issues and a guilt complex. The movie left me wondering Where can Brand go from here? Can he keep milking the same royalty-of-scuzz routine he does on awards shows? If Get Him to the Greek elevates his career as I suspect it will maybe well get to see where the rock star leaves off and the movie star begins.

Get Him to the Greek Director Nicholas Stoller. Cast Russell Brand Jonah Hill Sean Combs. Rating Rated R for strong sexual content and drug use throughout and pervasive language. RELATED Rock movies Russell Brand who always seems to be playing a version of himself reprises the role in writer and director Nicholas Stollers often laugh-out-loud funny sort-of sequel. As hilarious as Brand was in ""Sarah Marshall"" Im still not convinced he can carry a movie himself. Luckily he doesnt have to; co-star Jonah Hill not reprising his earlier role shoulders much of the load and hes fantastic. This performance along with his work as the title character in the upcoming ""Cyrus"" move him well past the Seth Rogen Jr. types he seemed destined to play. Not that he wasnt good at it but hes capable of much more and hes proving it. Here Hill plays Aaron Green a low-level record executive toiling for basket-case mogul Sergio (an inspired Sean Combs). Sergio wants ideas; Aaron hits upon Aldous and his band Infant Sorrow playing an anniversary show at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles scene of a triumphant concert 10 years before. Aldous could use the boost. After years of being clean Aldous hits a run of bad luck. As the film opens hes filming the video for his latest song ""African Child"" a spectacularly misguided effort. Then his wife and mother of his child pop star Jackie Q (Rose Byrne) dumps him on live TV. Aldous doesnt fall off the wagon so much as take a flying leap. Sergio dispatches Aaron to escort Aldous to the concert. This of course will prove to be a herculean effort with Aldous more interested in sampling every drink drug and groupie along the way. Hard to make your flights that way. Aaron a grounded decent sort gets sucked into the lifestyle though hes not particularly suited for it. Has any character thrown up more? But this is a Judd Apatow production so you can be sure that the two will also bond along the way though in rather unorthodox fashion. Another Apatow touch Aaron believes he and his girlfriend exhausted medical student Daphne (Elisabeth Moss) have split up thus making him feel a little less guilty for his road-trip behavior. On the other hand if Apatows movies promise something they deliver which is something you might want to keep in mind when Snows suggestions become more and more outrageous. (In a somewhat related note I have never laughed harder at a stab wound.) Among Aldous stops are a visit with his father (Colm Meaney) a musician in Las Vegas and Jackie now living with Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich. (Aldous subtle putdown is brilliant.) While there are laughs in each scene theres also a darker tone as well. Like many Apatow productions ""Greek"" doesnt quite know when to stop and things arent brought to a particularly satisfying resolution. But Brand does a nice job adding a few dramatic shadings to his character a pleasant surprise. And Hill is outstanding. His Aaron gets in over his head early and knows it but also knows he must play along if he is to deliver Aldous on time - his method for keeping the manic rock star sober before an appearance on ""Today"" for instance is a bit of unhinged genius. ""Get Him to the Greek"" isnt as good as ""Sarah Marshall"" not quite. But as an encore for Brands Aldous its a welcome return. And for Hill its a chance to really shine.

Comments (3) Get Him to the Greek Recommended Video Rated R  109 minutes  2010 When your parents saw this movie it was called My Favorite Year (1982) and concerned a young TV writer in the 1950s whos ordered to chaperone a drunken washed-up matinee idol (Peter OToole) through the rehearsal and live broadcast of a prime-time variety show. Now its the latest comedy from the Judd Apatow factory and the comic premise still works like a charm. Jonah Hill is a record-company intern sent to London to collect dissolute rock god Russell Brand (reprising his role from Forgetting Sarah Marshall) and deliver him to a comeback concert at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles. As in My Favorite Year the laughs all come from seeing a nervous innocent pulled into the stars debauchery the heart from our growing realization that debauchery is just emptiness with the volume cranked.

Its a complete and utter mess from the big-loud-dumb start to the awwww-thats-so-sweet finish. Its hardly a narrative at all more like a loosely-stitched-together hodgepodge of scenes starring the same characters as they hurl toward the titular venue but not before making myriad soused and sentimental pit stops along the way in London New York and Las Vegas--all in three days time tops.Which is not to suggest its not entertaining--far from it. Get Him to the Greek is a mess but an amiable and occasionally uproarious one due mostly to Russell Brands reprising of his role as Aldous Snow. He is or was in Sarah Marshall the teetotaling frontman for Infant Sorrow a sort of Spinal Tap redux best known for its groupies (the Sorrow Suckers) and such hits as ""Inside of You"" ""The Clap"" ""Gang of Lust"" and ""I Am Jesus."" In Sarah Marshall Aldous was the guest star in someone elses story--that of Peter Bretter (Jason Segel) whose TV-star girlfriend Sarah (Kristen Bell) ran off with Aldous to Hawaii. But even in a bit part Brand a comic who already fancies himself a rocker played Aldous with the smug self-righteousness of all rehabbed rockers way too quick to remind you theyve swapped booze and dope for yoga and politics. And He wore leather pants to the beach.With Peter absent and Sarah reduced to a blink-and-youll-miss-her throwaway gag Aldous has moved center stage just in front of the pyrotechnics. And initially it seems like it could be too much of a good thing Brand starts out at 11 playing Aldous like some arena-rock version of a Sacha Baron Cohen character. The first thing we see is a graphic exploitive war-torn video for the Infant Sorrow song ""African Child"" set in ""Darfur Zimbabwe Rwanda""--Aldous new to cause-rock isnt quite sure which. He compares himself to an ""African white Christ from space""; others argue hes the worst thing to happen to race relations since apartheid. And so rather quickly begins Snows fall--a descent expedited by the on-air bust-up of his relationship with singer Jackie Q (Rose Byrne) who insists during an interview that he was more tolerable when he was fucked up.So off the wagon he goes--just in time for a lower-rung record-label lackey named Aaron Green (Jonah Hill) to pitch an Infant Sorrow comeback concert to his boss Sergio (Sean Combs never more Puff Daddy than here). Hill isnt reprising his role from Forgetting Sarah Marshall--Matthew the Hawaiian resort waiter with the creepy crush on Aldous. Aaron is a tempered version of Matthew (and consequently most of Hills stable of outsize characters) Hes still a fan (framed Infant Sorrow posters adorn his walls) but just a fan not a stalker with a demo disc. Hes well adjusted enough to even have a cute-n-cuddly relationship with a nurse played by Mad Mens Elisabeth Moss. Aaron simply believes a label in need of a boost could do no better than resurrecting Snow--""one of the last remaining rock stars"" says Aaron to whom Aldous is Robert Plant and Keith Richards rolled into one big ball of facial hair.Sergio dispatches Aaron to retrieve Aldous with the instructions to ""mind-fuck"" him into staying straight and getting on the plane and to the Today show first followed by the gig at the Greek. Things of course dont go as planned--at which point writer-director Nicholas Stoller responsible for Sarah Marshall turns Get Him to the Greek into a desperately demented version of Cameron Crowes buzzed-on-nostalgia autobiography Almost Famous--by which I mean instead of a scruffy Lester Bangs hanging around to mentor a shy naif youll find instead an out-of-control Puff Daddy who shows up in hallucinations to eat his own head and later demands Aaron have sex with a woman who will eventually rape him with her spare dildo. Its a whole different flavor of coming-of-age movie.Judd Apatow produced--cant you just smell the man-on-man love affair from here? Sooner than later Aarons girlfriend drops out of the picture which leaves Aaron free to live the rock-and-roll lifestyle with Aldous who it turns out has little stomach left for the decadence a sentiment that rubs off on Aaron along with several other stickier substances. Joints and women will be shared; lessons will be learned. Hey this is an Apatow film all right the stoner movie that eventually turns into a just-say-no PSA. Now group hug--or threesome in this movies case.Thats what Get Him to the Greek ultimately has going for it Its crude loud dumb fun. And on top of that it contains the greatest cameo ever by a winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics.

Although Russell Brands self-indulgent rock star was at times the most memorable aspect of ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" spinning off that supporting player into a not-quite-sequel represents the kind of chutzpah only a producer with Judd Apatows clout would try to engineer. Yet ""Sarah"" director Nick Stoller has mostly pulled it off capitalizing on the wretched excess the rocker lifestyle embraces to deliver a number of gross-out moments almost worthy of ""The Hangover."" Theres even some heart here too though its not fatal to the fun which should attract enough ticket-buying groupies to justify this encore. Jonah Hill played a worshipful waiter in that earlier movie but he occupies a (slightly) different role here -- one that falls somewhere between ""Almost Famous"" and ""My Favorite Year"" albeit with lots of vomiting. A junior executive at Pinnacle Records Hills Aaron Green proposes a comeback performance by Aldous Snow (Brand) who like a lot of aging rockers has fallen on hard times. This backstory is dispensed with in an eight-minute montage consisting of faux news clips -- shows like ""Access Hollywood"" and ""TMZ"" play along -- which might be the highlight of the movie. The segment charts how Aldous and model/singer/girlfriend Jackie Q (Rose Byrne displaying unexpectedly fine comedy chops with a British accent) horribly misfired with ""African Child"" an album whose insensitivity might set UNICEF back 20 years. Aarons foul-mouthed boss Sergio (a scene-stealing Sean Combs) finally sparks to the idea of a comeback giving Aaron the task of collecting Snow in London stopping over in New York to do a ""Today"" show appearance and then making it to Los Angeles for the Greek Theater concert all in a matter of days. Of course there are complications inasmuch as Snow is as Sergio puts it the ""slipperiest most conniving motherfucker on the face of the Earth."" Getting him there will thus require various sacrifices from Aaron who has just split with his med-student g.f. Daphne (""Mad Mens Elisabeth Moss) not least the often groan-inducing oddities that wind up spewing out of or being put into him. Meeting ones idols is always a dicey proposition but director Stoller (who also wrote and produced) manages to forge an unlikely bond between the mismatched pair despite all the abuse Aldous heaps upon Aaron. As R-rated comedy goes the Apatow stable has become almost a can-you-top-this competition and at times ""Greek"" works a little too hard toward that end with a tone occasionally bordering on frantic. Still barring a few lapses the gags fly by in rapid-fire fashion and enough of them connect -- thanks in part to the amusing mix of Hills hang-dog demeanor with Brands lanky relentless hedonism. Brand and Byrne also do a credible job belting out various songs which -- even with the loony lyrics and outlandishly vulgar videos -- often possess rather catchy hooks. (As the producers noted the goal was to make them silly but believable as rock hits as opposed to sounding like parodies.) ""Get Him to the Greek"" is also notable as the latest Universal release to feature a conspicuous and extended tie-in with sister network NBCs ""Today"" (co-host Meredith Vieira plays herself) after Matt Lauer fulfilled a similar role in ""Land of the Lost."" In this case one suspects the synergistic payoff will be considerably happier for the studio.
