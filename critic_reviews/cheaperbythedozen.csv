(AP Photo/Tracy Bennett) Tracy Bennett / 20th Century Fox Photo TRACY BENNETT Mom Dad 12 children and dozens of laughs 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Cheaper by the Dozen Family comedy. Starring Steve Martin Bonnie Hunt Hilary Duff Tom Welling and Piper Perabo. Directed by Shawn Levy. Written by Sam Harper Joel Cohen and Alec Sokolow. (PG. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. ) The memoir ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" depicted a household of 12 siblings at the turn of the 20th century -- a time when reproducing in double-digit numbers was far from unusual. By the time the book became a movie in 1950 American families had begun to downsize but they were nowhere near todays demographics. The new version of ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" in which perennial movie dad Steve Martin sires 12 kids with Bonnie Hunt (among them the very hot Hilary Duff Piper Perabo and Tom Welling) deserves credit for not glossing over the impact of the countrys population changes. When the family leaves its farmland for a larger town so Tom Baker (Martin) can coach college football the Baker clan is treated as if it came from Mars. ""Its irresponsible thats what it is"" sniffs a new neighbor whose progeny consists of a single kid. Bakers jokes about how he couldnt keep wife Kate off of him fall on uncomprehending ears. Theres a lot of truth here in the way large families are treated like pariahs. In a family of eight Im familiar with the parents often respond by asking critics which child they wish hadnt been born. Director Shawn Levy (""Big Fat Liar"" ""Just Married"") and three clever screenwriters sneaked in an advertisement for the merits of a multitude of siblings -- theyll defend you in the schoolyard and the larger world as well -- along with a gentle plea to live and let live. This subtle message raises the worth of ""Cheaper."" Its not just a feel-good holiday movie though audiences especially youngsters will certainly walk out of it feeling good. Much of the merriment is due to Martins facility with comedy particularly the physical variety. Hes the spiritual heir to Keaton (Buster not Diane). Coming to the rescue of assorted children Martin winds up launched into the ozone by an exploding trampoline and swinging from a chandelier in the supposed safety of his own home. Levy doesnt know when to stop with the slapstick though. That same fixture crashes not once but four times. The original movie didnt go for slapstick. Pop played by the curmudgeonly Clifton Webb was an efficiency expert who whipped his tribe into assembly-line precision. Remnants of that plot can be seen in meal preparation -- one Baker offspring spreads the jelly and the next in line folds the bread -- and in Dads use of a megaphone to get everyones attention. But Martins patriarch is more of an inefficiency expert lovable but clueless at what it takes to run a house the size of a bed and breakfast. Baker is hardly more adept at running a big-time football program at a major university. The choice of professions seems misbegotten. Al Pacino you could buy screaming on the sidelines but Martin doesnt project the authority required of coaching at this level. He seems as if he would get laughs from his players instead of respect. By contrast Hunt is totally believable as a devoted mom moonlighting as a writer. Kate is at work on the Baker family saga titled -- surprise -- ""Cheaper by the Dozen."" But she allows the computer to idle at her childrens slightest need. Hunt one of the most natural actresses around makes being a supermom look easy. A family crisis develops when the manuscript is bought and her agent schedules a New York trip for her. Duff amusing as the familys fashionista advises Mom to leave the pastel ensembles at home and pack only navy and gray. But the bigger issue is who will watch the kids while Kates away. Dad insists he can handle it but makes a disaster of things almost immediately with food flying around the table and kids barfing. He attempts to hire help but gets rejected by everyone when they hear the size of his brood. Apparently it doesnt occur to him to put several baby sitters on the payroll. Of course if he did it might negate the comic disasters that keep coming in Moms absence. The child actors are uniformly adorable and avoid those precious mannerisms for which their breed is known. Ashton Kutcher gets credit for spoofing himself in a small role as Perabos vain boyfriend an aspiring actor who wants nothing to do with her family. Hes still resentful that the kids once set his pants on fire. ""What if it had been my face?"" he says. ""Its my moneymaker. Im not that good of an actor.""

"The Parents Trapped washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids The Parents Trapped Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 26 2003 THE CHIEF operating word the crucial active ingredient in ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" is anxiety. As in the constant scene of screaming children sibling squabbles school-lunch preparation homework monitoring and other madhouse-factory conditions that mark any day at the Baker household. There are 12 children in this family and only two parents to handle them all. Yet Tom (Steve Martin) and Kate Baker (Bonnie Hunt) seem more than up to the multitasking required. You ask yourself Does their apparent serenity come from a bodhisattva-like constitution or prescription medicine? The answer is neither. Its just plain old love of family as well as perfectly synchronized teamwork between husband and wife as they manage to push their kids out the front door just before school every morning. Sound familiar? Such a brutal lifestyle needs only one or two little developments to upset the proverbial apple cart. In ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" the disaster begins when high school football coach Tom gets his dream job head coach of his alma maters football team. The job also means moving from their Chicago suburb to a bigger one. It means changing schools losing friends. It means ending life as everyone knows it. Nonetheless the family votes to move just to please Dad. (Actually the parents pretty much rig the vote as is often the case in the controlled democracy model practiced by many a parent.) It gets worse. Mom suddenly lands a book contract and a two-week publicity tour. This means Tom is going to have to run a football team and the family. New operating word for the Baker family Disaster. If theres a moral it seems to be If youre uh bold enough (there might be other adjectives to bestow on this approach to family planning) to have 12 kids you shouldnt expect to ever see professional life again unless you find the magic plan. Otherwise the only way you can step out of the house is accompanied by at least two children in a station wagon and with a shopping list. The movie a remake of a 1950 movie starring Clifton Webb and an adaptation of the autobiographical book by Frank B. Gilbreth Jr. and Ernestine Gilbreth Carey is hardly riddled with surprise or even spark. There are many little episodes the least of which involves Hilary Duff as a vanity-conscious teen daughter and the funniest of which includes Ashton Kutcher as Hank the aspiring actor and boyfriend of eldest daughter Nora (Piper Perabo) who knows his handsome face is his only ticket to television fame. But ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" has the quality of being disarmingly unassuming. As the dad Martin (who made such a good harried parent in ""Parenthood"") is often amusing and Hunt makes a likable tough and loving mom. And if the children are essentially a schematic representation of stereotypes their collective needs whines and family togetherness are certainly real enough. This is a movie that knows its audience and realizes it doesnt need much of a story to hit that audience literally where it lives. If ever there was an inconsequential video rental for a Friday night this is it.

"A Slightly Cracked Fresh Dozen washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living >> Follow Style On A Slightly Cracked Fresh Dozen Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday December 25 2003 How things have changed. In 1950 Clifton Webb and Myrna Loy played the parents of 12 children whose most worrisome acts of insurrection were confined to bobbing their hair and wearing lipstick. In Shawn Levys current adaptation of ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" Ernestine Gilbreth Careys best-selling memoir Tom and Kate Baker (Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt) are contending with a daughter who wants to sleep with her boyfriend; their youngest kids execute diabolical pranks with military precision. Even Tom and Kate themselves still evince a certain friskiness. ""I couldnt keep her off me"" Tom explains to new neighbors appalled at the size of the Bakers brood. But thats about as racy as it gets in ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" a genial strenuously hip comedy aimed straight at families looking for ways to enliven holiday longueurs. Its the height of ersatz Hollywood Americana (the Bakers suburban Illinois house is of the architectural type known as Evanston-by-way-of-Melrose Avenue) but Martin and Hunt give the production a mellow warmth. And Levy has cast an appealingly diverse bunch of kids to play the young Bakers from the burgeoning stars Tom Welling and Hilary Duff as two slightly snarky teenagers to a passel of refreshingly off-kilter youngsters whose edgy quirks give spike and flavor to an otherwise vanilla enterprise. (And watch for a funny cameo from Ashton Kutcher playing a fatuous young actor.) In the 1950 movie Frank Gilbreth used his kids as subjects in his motion-study experiments; here Tom and Kate are both dedicated to their careers Tom as a football coach and Kate as a writer. Although she left her newspaper job midway through her maternal journey she has just written a memoir that is going to be published. Meanwhile Tom has been offered a job coaching the team at his alma mater. Dramatic tension ensues when the Bakers try to balance a huge family while pursuing their youthful dreams. Of course such a project has to entail a pet frog plopping into a dish of scrambled eggs a bout of tag-team vomiting a recurring set piece with a crashing chandelier and a grand finale involving a birthday party a trampoline and a live snake. ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" hits all the compulsory beats of a movie that depends for its laughs on carefully choreographed mayhem. But Hunt and Martin manage to inject their signature brands of low-key humor where they can despite the movies broadest efforts. (The lack of subtlety extends to its parent studios insistently dropping its own name even on one of Toms teams jerseys.) ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" is an unobjectionable if uninspired updating of a classic family story for the minivan generation. If anything its encouraging to see a movie that hinges on a man wondering whether he can have it all. The movies answer might be predictably pat but it still deserves a little credit for asking the question. Cheaper by the Dozen (90 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for language and some thematic elements.

Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunts family life is thrown into chaos when their careers take off simultaneously. By Sam Urdank Twentieth Century Fox But it is neither. Its only tenuous connection to the original work is a family with 12 children. The character of the exacting eccentric inventor father played by Clifton Webb in the earlier film is replaced by an easygoing football coach played by Steve Martin who seems about as bored starring in this movie as we are watching it. Myrna Loy portrayed the mother in the previous Dozen which was set at the turn of the 20th century. We get Bonnie Hunt circa today. The family lives a fairly idyllic existence in a small college town until Martin is offered his dream job coaching at a big university in Chicago. The kids -- an unremarkable lot ranging in age from twentysomething to preschooler -- are miserable about moving. And then at the most inopportune moment its Moms turn for her dream career move to come true too. Turns out the memoir she has been crafting for years finally has been published and she must embark on a book tour. Pronto. So the kids move to Chicago with a pair of absentee parents. Where their biggest concern in the country had been keeping a pet frog from leaping into the scrambled eggs every morning once they hit the city they must fend off high school toughs. The movie is so calculatedly cast with popular kid stars that it seems a focus group was guiding all the choices. Hilary Duff the perky Lizzie Maguire star has a tiny and uninteresting role. That 70s Shows Ashton Kutcher sends up his image with one of the funnier parts the narcissistic actor boyfriend of oldest daughter Piper Perabo. Tom Welling the heartthrob star of Smallville plays the oldest brother. Shawn Levy directs Cheaper which is about the same caliber as his last couple of plodding laugh-free comedies Just Married and Big Fat Liar. Cheaper by the Dozen makes one long for Martins edgy work in films such as The Spanish Prisoner. Lately it seems he has been too busy bringing down the house with broad comedies and writing books on the side to choose his film parts more wisely. (Opens Thursday nationally.

From the get-go were propelled along an easy plotline bombarded with happy tunes and deposited at the other end completely unharmed except for windblown hair. Whoosh Another 90 minutes of your life gone. Wasnt it fun? Just dont bring your brain. Itll only get in the way. ""Cheaper"" is less a movie than a testament to marketing. Whats worked for Steve Martin in the past? Well the ""Father of the Bride"" series his updating of the Spencer Tracy films. That was popular. So lets take another family comedy from that era the 1950 Clifton Webb vehicle and update it beyond recognition. Then lets add several teeny-bop idols (Tom Welling of ""Smallville"" Hilary Duff) so the kids will want to go. Then well torture an actor (the uncredited Ashton Kutcher) that people want to see tortured. As for conflicts? Theyll result from a wealth of opportunities rather than a lack of them. Movie review Showtimes and trailer 1/2 ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" with Steve Martin Bonnie Hunt Tom Welling Hilary Duff. Directed by Shawn Levy. Written by Sam Harper Joel Cohen and Alec Sokolow. 99 minutes. Rated PG for language and some thematic elements. Several theaters. The ""dozen"" in the title refers to the dozen kids -- yes all their own -- of Tom and Kate Baker (Martin and Bonnie Hunt) who live a nice if hectic existence in a Midwest farming community named Midland. Tom is the local college football coach Kate is writing a book about family life. Their biggest problem -- besides dealing with the chaos that erupts when a pet frog gets loose on their breakfast table -- is remembering the names of their kids. We sympathize. To the filmmakers credit more than half the children become distinct during the course of the film. Theres Superman (Welling) the princess (Duff) the skateboarder (Jacob Smith) the tomboy/schemer (Alyson Stoner) the fat kid (Kevin Schmidt) the WWE twins (Brent and Shane Kinsman) and Woody Allen (Forrest Landis) who not only has red hair and glasses but in ""Take the Money and Run"" fashion actually has his glasses tossed aside (but not crunched) by bullies at school. The controlled chaos of Midland erupts into the real kind when Tom lands his dream job coaching a Division I school and the troops are moved en masse to Chicago where their neighbors have if any one overprotected child sometimes literally leashed. At the same time Kates book is accepted for publication and shes immediately whisked off on a book tour. So whos gonna take care of the kids? Tom tries but hes got press conferences and an emasculating boss and the kids get short shrift. The WWE twins dont get their morning growl from their father. Superman misses his Midland girlfriend and is treated like a rube at school -- even though he looks like well Superman and his father is the Midwest equivalent of Don James a combination youd think would win him at least a few friends. (Whoops. Brain. Sorry.) Meanwhile Woody Allen the (literal) red-headed (figurative) step-child is more ignored than ever. Its interesting contemplating Martin. The wild n crazy guy of the 70s became the uptight dad of the 90s. Here hes less uptight Essentially hes the father he became at the end of Ron Howards ""Parenthood"" the one who enjoys the roller-coaster ride of life. But as a football coach? Not a chance. Too light on his feet. Ill give ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" this It has tons of energy. More kids equals more life -- thats its essence. It just makes us long for the deep dark complexity of a Ron Howard film.

Orange mans 2nd trial nets life term in killing - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Sentence Orange mans 2nd trial nets life term in killingJuly 10 2009|By Sarah Lundy and Amy L. Edwards Sentinel Staff WritersA judge sentenced a 22-year-old Orange County man to life in prison without parole Thursday in a 2006 fatal shooting during a drug deal gone wrong.Deangelo Conner was convicted last month of first-degree murder armed robbery and two counts of robbery with a firearm.Florida law required Circuit Judge Bob Wattles to sentence Conner to life in prison for the murder conviction.Conner had turned down a 25-year plea offer and took his chances at trial.His first trial ended in a mistrial after jurors were heard discussing the case before it was allowed.Authorities say Conner shot Ricardo Rivera 41 once in the chest July 6 2006.Conner and two others initially set up the meeting as a drug buy but they never intended to pay for anything the prosecution said; the three planned to grab the drugs and run.At one point Conner pulled out a gun and fired at Rivera. Conner told investigators that Rivera was charging toward him and he was merely protecting himself.The jury didnt buy it.Several of Ricardo Riveras relatives attended the sentencing including his children and brother Robert Rivera who read statements from several people.In a statement Ricardo Riveras ex-wife wrote that the hardest thing she has had to do was tell her children they no longer had a father.The woman wrote that her familys hurt will never go away.

Pic is as far from the original and its autobiographical memoir source as it can be while retaining the same title. Update shows an unrecognizable contempo world that veers between group hugs and domestic demolition derbies. Undoubtedly trying to give the audience what it wants ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" unfortunately knows no tone between schmaltzy/gooey and slapstick/gross-out. Pic is as far from the original pic and its autobiographical memoir source as it can be while retaining the same title. Movies dont come more square than the 1950 version starring Clifton Webb and Myrna Loy. Update rather than looking at modern kids attitudes and todays parents professional needs shows an unrecognizable contempo world that veers between group hugs and domestic demolition derbies. Still ""Cheaper"" should tap into a wide-ranging audience looking for a change from the parade of tragedies and historical epics this holiday season making for plentiful B.O. gifts under Foxs tree. After 23 years of marriage and 12 kids Tom and Kate Baker (Steve Martin Bonnie Hunt) seem to have found domestic bliss. Over opening credits Kates voiceover recalls their high school courtship and mutual desire for a big family his sacrificing of a promising Division 1 college football coaching career (for lowly Division 3) and her departure from the newspaper game in order to raise their brood in the sylvan peace of Midland Ill. Theres an early glimpse of the mass chaos to come when after a pleasantly messy but warm group project making breakfast young pet-obsessed Mark (Forrest Landis) tries to snag his escaping frog and turns the breakfast table and kitchen into a disaster area. Generally though this is as well-behaved a bunch as family units come these days even including problem teen Charlie (Tom Welling) and fashion slave Lorraine (Hilary Duff). But when Tom gets an offer to coach a Division 1 team at Lincoln U. in Evanston this complex nuclear unit gradually goes into meltdown. The new two-story house near Chicago is prettier and more spacious than the old place but the kids are grumpy from the start and soon turn into little monsters. Suddenly blind to the brewing children problems after he has been shown to be attentive to every family detail Tom is depicted as falling into that horrible modern trap of wanting it all. So is Kate whose new book (adorned with pics title) is to be published and who goes on a book tour to support it. Key to the pitfalls of the script by Sam Harper Joel Cohen and Alec Sokolow (from Craig Titleys screen story) is allowing the family members to forget themselves and everything that they are. Even the Bakers one grown child Nora (Piper Perabo) cant help especially with her current beauself-admiring thesp Hank (Ashton Kutcher in whats likely the years biggest uncredited role) as a constant target of the tykes pranks. With mom away and dad on the gridiron the clan and movie both devolve into someones idea of amusing comic warfare. Since Webbs father in original film was a picture of goofy but subdued physical and verbal comedy Martin would seem to be ideal cast as the patriarch. But his assignment here appears wrong on every level Hes never convincing as either a coach or disciplinarian and never has a chance to work up any chemistry with Hunt whose own comic charms are kept in detention. And where Martins most needed -- as an emergency writer to salvage the script -- hes not used. The swarm of kid thesps vie for screen time with Landis as the odd duck (and eventual object of the sentimental finish) given some space to make an impression. Casting seems to have been based on ability and not appearance as many of the small fry share little physical resemblance to each other or their movie parents. Mediocre production look as well as the nervous need to push human comedy into zoo-like antics matches the dreadful ""Just Married"" also made by the filmmaking squad of helmer Shawn Levy producer Robert Simonds writer Sam Harper lenser Jonathan Brown designer Nina Ruscio and composer Christophe Beck.
