Which is precisely what we dont get with this predictably crass Hollywood treatment of a serious complex issue. Paul (Kinnear) and Jessie (Romijn-Stamos) are devastated when their son Adam is killed shortly after his eighth birthday. Maverick geneticist Prof Richard Wells (De Niro) interrupts their grieving with a proposition and a few months later Jessie gives birth to another baby boy. All goes well with this new Adam until he passes the age at which his predecessor died. Just like the reborn Adam Godsend only functions properly up to a certain point the protracted convoluted denouement is an embarrassingly nonsensical misfire.

"Godsend another clone movie. Slate Sign In Sign Up Godsend another clone movie. Godsend another clone movie. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.April 30 2004 550 PM Our Beautiful Baby Clone The genetic inferiority of Godsend. By David Edelstein De Niro should have said no to this script Ive been waiting years for a good serious cloning thriller and hoping when it came that it wouldnt be screwed up by morons. Godsend (Lions Gate) looked nifty on paper Its the story of couple (Greg Kinnear and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) who lose their 8-year-old son (Cameron Bright) in a freak accident (bouncing ball construction site car) and get approached on the steps of their church by a satanic-looking doctor (Robert De Niro) who wants to implant a genetic duplicate in the mothers uterus. The gimmick could hardly be timelier. Whatever our moral qualms about this brave new genetically engineered world were going to be living in it soon and were going to wind up with human clones eventually The market guarantees it if not in this country then somewhere within easy reach of the worlds rich and unscrupulous. So why not dramatize it now? Advertisement The good news about Godsend is that it hasnt ruined that killer premise It just chucks it out the window and turns it into a pea-brained hodgepodge of The Omen (1976) The SixthSense (1999) and about 30 Grade-Z Bela Lugosi mad-scientist movies. You know its just a clumsy rip-off when theres a cut from the cloned son (name of Adam by the way) being delivered to the new childs eighth birthday--thats the same age that Adam 1 got flattened. Apparently not of interest to the screenwriter Mark Bomback or the director Nick Hamm are the years in which the couple raises the same child they raised before while trying to keep their secret from him and the rest of the world. For these guys the movie doesnt really get going until Adam 2 starts having visions of Adam 1 (the music goes BONNNNGGGG) along with impulses to finger an ax a claw hammer etc. The audience is desperately confused as Adam 2 seems to be channeling a pair of kids his former self and someone named ""Zachary""--which I took at first to be an omega-boy variation on the name Adam. Well no theres a twist coming--so stupid and so irrelevant that it would have destroyed the movie if there had been a movie to begin with. Shot entirely in Canada Godsend offers weak echoes of David Cronenberg--who should someday tackle a cloning movie of his own come to think of it. Romijn-Stamos seems to want us to know shes ready to move up to mature bimbos now that Charlize Theron has copped her Academy Award; but she should learn to throw away lines that begin ""You know I respect your ethics."" She says that to Kinnear by the way who turns into the movies moralist ""Its not about science or evolution"" he explains helpfully. ""Its about moral trespass."" Actually its about cheap exploitation picture shocks only sprung with such solemn ineptitude that the movie wouldnt rattle an expectant mother. Opposite De Niro Kinnear once again does his impression of Bewitcheds Darrin in a dinner-theater production of Death of a Salesman. As for the Great Actor himself he should have learned from the last Frankenstein movie he took part in--Kenneth Branaghs 1994 catastrophe. As I watched his increasingly embarrassed performance in this train wreck of a film I thought of Lugosis epitaph in Ed Woods Bride of the Monster (1955) ""He meddled in Gods domain ...""

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

Heck if a barber butchered my do like that Id change my name to Damian and flip out too. Okay so the boy (Cameron Bright) doesnt really change his name to Damian. Nevertheless he does start talking about someone named Zachary a lot even as he starts making eerie pronouncements such as ""Dad I dont think I like you so much anymore"" and ""Something bads going to happen."" Thats in between spitting at his teachers and having the kind of nightmares that made me think the family must live on Elm Street. I guess Mom wasnt kidding when she howled during labor ""Somethings wrooong"" Lets start with the fact that Paul Duncan (Kinnear) a biology teacher for crying out loud allows this misbegotten plan to proceed at all. One minute hes arguing with his wife Jessie (Romijn-Stamos) -- a very sensible argument I might add -- that even if the clone looks exactly like Adam No. 1 its still going to be a different person and the next minute hes handing her the phone to call Dr. Frankenstein. Excuse me make that fertility expert Dr. Richard Wells (Robert De Niro sporting both an avuncular twinkle and a satanic-looking Vandyke beard). Look I know there are gullible folks out there and parents in mourning are probably among the most susceptible but hasnt anyone in this movie seen ""Rosemarys Baby""? You want a second child to replace your first one but you cant conceive? One option is adoption people. Look it up. Anyhoo Adam No. 2/Zachary/Damian comes along and everything is hunky-dory until his eighth birthday (the age at which Adam No. 1 died). Then Dr. Wells starts acting a little too emotionally invested and Jessie takes a vacation -- to the state of denial. That leaves only Paul to unravel whats really going on. And unravel it does. As the films boo moments get spookier and more frequent ""Godsend"" gets more and more inane -- not to mention derivative. As it turns out Adam isnt the only product of a test tubes worth of secondhand DNA and far too little imagination. GODSEND (PG-13 100 minutes) -- Contains some violent imagery mild obscenity a scene of discreet lovemaking thematic material related to the death of a child and lots of moments designed to make you jump in your seat.

Egregiously unsatisfying ending and lack of high-voltage shocks will be enough to generate unfavorable word-of-mouth among undemanding genre fans. Expect pic to be consigned quickly to homevid purgatory. Solid performances handsome production values and a few genuinely creepy scenes are not enough to save ""Godsend."" After a modestly promising set-up pic devolves into a stale rehash of cliches and conventions left over from dozens of demon-child thrillers that trailed ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Omen"" throughout the 1970s and early 80s. Egregiously unsatisfying ending -- reportedly one of several shot by helmer Nick Hamm -- and lack of high-voltage shocks will be enough to generate unfavorable word-of-mouth among undemanding genre fans. No one else will bother. Expect ""Godsend"" to be consigned quickly to homevid purgatory. High school biology teacher Paul Duncan (Greg Kinnear) dashes through a rainy inner-cityscape -- avoiding being mugged only because the knife-wielding thug is a former student. He arrives home in time to help wife Jessie (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) supervise a birthday party for Adam (Cameron Bright) their beloved 8-year-old son. Domestic scene conveys love warmth and overall contentment. So of course it takes only about 10 minutes for something dreadful to happen. Hamm skillfully sustains suspense during a shopping spree that climaxes with wrenching yet discreetly rendered tragedy Adam is killed in a freakish auto mishap. Immediately after the funeral Adams grieving parents are approached by Dr. Richard Wells (Robert De Niro) a seemingly compassionate and reasonable-sounding scientist who proposes an ethically dubious (and highly illegal) procedure He will clone cells of their dead son so Jessie can give birth to him all over again. Jessie readily accepts the risk Paul overcomes his initial reluctance -- and a Faustian bargain is struck. To ensure the experiment remains a secret Paul and Jessie agree to quit their jobs sever contacts with friends and family and resettle in a small town near Wells Godsend Fertility Clinic. The cloning is successful -- or so it seems -- and the Duncans remain in their new home to raise their born-again child. Wells continues to be a frequent visitor and close observer familiar enough to be greeted as ""Uncle Richard"" by the new and improved Adam (Cameron Bright again). After Adams eighth birthday however he begins to exhibit strange often hostile behavior. Worse hes troubled by nightmarish visions of burning classrooms trapped students lethal claw hammers -- and a very bad little boy who looks a lot like him. Wells insists the dreams are nothing more than ""night terrors."" But Paul suspects otherwise and his worst fears are entirely justified. To their credit Hamm and scripter Mark Bomback avoid graphic mayhem while striving for subtly unsettling atmospherics. In this they are aided by moodily-lit lensing of Kramer Morgenthau and nimble editing of Steve Mirkovich and Niven Howie. But the surface gloss does little to disguise the inherent pulpiness of the material. And the predictability of the plot undercuts game efforts on both sides of the cameras. De Niro doggedly struggles to maintain a facade of benign sincerity during first half of ""Godsend"" but his character is so obviously an archetypical mad scientist that his best efforts are inadvertently comical. Also funny unfortunately is nervous tic that makes Wells look like a land-locked version of Capt. Queeg from ""The Caine Mutiny"" -- during moments of stress he rattles steel balls like worry beads. In another break from light comedy roles Kinnear impresses with an affecting portrayal of a man torn between paternal love and mounting dread. Even more here than in ""Auto Focus"" he demonstrates a no-sweat ability to handle heavily dramatic parts with a bare minimum of comic relief. Romijn-Stamos is persuasive and sympathetic despite being saddled with a few too many crying scenes. Bright works hard but often appears adrift particularly during the anti-climactic finale. Its worth noting that pics advertising tagline -- ""Adam Duncan. Born Dec. 11 1987. Died Dec. 12 1995. Born Sept. 23 1996."" - is a virtual reprise of the tag used to promote ""Audrey Rose"" Robert Wises not-dissimilar 1977 thriller about a possibly reincarnated little girl.

""Look honey"" says Greg Kinnear to Rebecca Romijn-Stamos toward the beginning of ""Godsend"" as he shows her their big new house in some Stepford-y suburb -- ""here are some Creepy Dark Steps leading to a Scary Dark Room in our Hellishly Terrifying Basement Where the Lights Have Been Known To Go Off For No Reason Isnt that terrific?"" Well OK he doesnt use those exact words but thats the effect. Run Rebecca Stay away from that basement Listen to the music -- dont you know what kind of movie youre in? Alas she chirps something about using the room to develop photographs and anyone beyond preschool age in the audience braces themselves for something thoroughly nasty to happen there within 90 minutes or so. Kinnear and Romijn-Stamos who deserve much credit for never once smirking play Paul and Jessie Duncan parents of an 8-year-old named Adam (Cameron Bright) whos tragically killed in a traffic accident in the first few minutes of the film. (Its not exactly sudden -- the kids so over-the-top angelic in his early scenes you can practically see his halo so we know hes not long for this world.) In their grieving they are approached by a mysterious doctor named Richard Wells (Robert De Niro all silver-haired and academic) who offers to help them he can if they act quickly implant Jessie with a clone embryo or something like that so they can re-create their little darling. Movie review Showtimes and trailer  ""Godsend"" with Robert De Niro Greg Kinnear Rebecca Romijn-Stamos Cameron Bright. Directed by Nick Hamm from a screenplay by Mark Bomback. 102 minutes. Rated PG-13 for violence including frightening images a scene of sexuality and some thematic material. Several theaters. Turns out though that Adam 2.0 has a few flaws such as a weirdly pointy short haircut a perpetually sinister expression and a violent streak as Mom and Dad learn to their horror. Young Bright has an eerie maturity to him; give him a briefcase and hed be just like a really short corporate lawyer bearing in for the kill. (Im getting a little worried about this kid who was also in the vile thriller ""The Butterfly Effect"" and will next play a creepy 10-year-old in the Nicole Kidman thriller ""Birth."" Shouldnt he some day make a movie that hed actually be allowed to watch?) Anyway ""Godsend"" fills up its allotted time with screams dark hallways ""Fatal Attraction""-esque bathtub scares nightmare flashback sequences mysterious figures from the past a creepy little house out in the woods a laughable reference to ""The Shining"" and Adam 2.0 staring fixedly at people with his icy little eyes. Director Nick Hamm keeps things busy but cant prevent a certain silliness from filtering through -- and its hard to be frightened when youre snickering. The only really big scare is at the end which does everything but sell tickets for the sequel. Please -- two Adams are more than enough.

(AP ... more Well son youre freaking out because youre a clone 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Godsend Drama. Starring Greg Kinnear Rebecca Romijn-Stamos and Robert De Niro. Directed by Nick Hamm. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In ""Godsend"" we have the spectacle of three good actors tied to the mast of a sinking premise. An idea for a movie rather than a successful drama it introduces a compelling situation and then boxes itself in unable to move without rocking its own foundation. When a climax is called for one is delivered but its arbitrary lacking in both honesty and impact. The one glimpse of good news is that Rebecca Romijn-Stamos shows here that shes an actress and not just a compelling presence. As the mother of an 8-year-old boy who is killed in a freak accident Romijn-Stamos has an emotional readiness thats unexpected. The scenes in which she and Greg Kinnear as the husband deal with the shock and lingering agony of grief are like excerpts from a better movie. Particularly strong is the moment when the couple decides on the radical step of having their son cloned. The husband looks at a video of the son on TV as his wife approaches. Without looking at her he just lifts the phone and holds it in the air. Thats the go-ahead to make the call. Shes calling Dr. Wells a scientific genius who runs a fertility clinic and has secretly perfected a method of cloning humans. As played by Robert De Niro Dr. Wells is the soul of reason but askew friendly without being reassuring. Hes just a little bit weird but once the couple signs on with him the fates of all three are intertwined. Human cloning is seriously illegal. The one-sentence hook for ""Godsend"" is this What happens if a baby is cloned and something ... goes wrong? In real life the ""something wrong"" would most probably be physical. A clone might age prematurely or gain excessive weight like that cloned sheep. In ""Godsend"" the problems are psychological. The child starts having night terrors and asking strange questions such as ""Daddy did I die?"" Heres the problem Our focus is on the parents. But all the action is happening inside the head of the kid. And because the kid has no idea whats happening much of the movie goes by without the problem being defined or articulated. So the story is at a standstill. This second-act trouble is followed by even worse third-act trouble in which the filmmakers violate the premise in search of thrills they never find. As the boy or rather the boys Cameron Bright has piercing eyes and a grin reminiscent of the guy who tried to kill George Wallace. But the movies failure to commit to a direction to define young Adam as either a malevolent force or an innocent victim consigns Brights performance to generalized schizophrenia and paralyzes the action. ""Godsend"" goes nowhere and takes the whole cast with it. -- Advisory This film contains violence.

Naturally that turns out to be the sort of huge mistake on which you can hang half a dozen sequels.Greg Kinnear and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos play Paul and Jessie Duncan who lose their boy Adam then their senses of morality then more or less their minds once a fertility doctor (Robert De Niro) offers them a chance for Jessie to be impregnated with one of Adams cells to create a ""genetically identical fetus."" The screwy doctor is just doing his job. Whats mom and dads excuse?Part of the deal means the Duncans have to leave New York (which is hard because Paul seems to think hes a hipster) ditch anyone they knew and move to Middle-of-Nowhere Vermont which Vermonters might recognize as Middle-of-Nowhere Montreal.Once there we can only assume things go swimmingly because we dont see much of the Duncans and their new son (Cameron Bright) until his eighth birthday. Adam died shortly after his first eighth birthday and not much after his second one he flips out and starts dreaming that hes walking in a school hallway and the kids all have dead faces. Theres lots of noise fast cuts and meaninglessness. Hes having a nightmare on Elm Street.Directed by Nick Hamm from a script by Mark Bomback ""Godsend"" wouldnt seem so terrible if it wanted to play in the fields of science fiction to create a world in which cloning is commonplace and have the procedure go horrifyingly wrong from there. The spectacular first hour of Steven Spielbergs ""A.I."" gave a similar issue thorns considering an unnatural childs natural sense of inadequacy.""Godsend"" makes no attempt to take Adam seriously -- yet naming him Adam is a joke the movie never gets around to telling. Whats the malfunction exactly? Psychology is beside the point. Instead the movie leans on the usual ""gotcha"" jump gags that produce bogus tension rather than narrative cogency. Adam skips right past being a scared confused little boy and straight to being a murderous horror-movie cipher.""Godsend"" also snags a run in its credibility. Paul Duncan is a biology teacher who never raises any biological questions about the cloning? Watching the blandly serious Kinnear getting righteous and trying to outact De Niro is lamentable. (De Niro isnt really doing a lot of acting here anyway.)Romijn-Stamos is miscast too. She often seems unjustifiably bored. But now that it looks as though Charlize Theron has given up junk horror flicks we can probably look forward to more of them starring Romijn-Stamos.The movie drags to a conflict between parents and son that turns out not to be much of a conflict after all. And it all terminates with one of the most inane conclusions Ive seen in a bad horror film.""Godsend"" makes swill of religion science family and morality. It has the sensitivity of a cactus the ingenuity of a square wheel and the integrity of a CEO. Adam seems to exist only to make his parents feel complete. The movie of course never says so but these people are sick. They dont need a child; they need a goldfish.

And the direction appropriately enough is courtesy of a British filmmaker and theater director named Nick Hamm. (Related video See a clip from Godsend) Science gone bad Robert DeNiro and Cameron Bright in Godsend. By Kerry Hayes Lions Gate Films Its certainly not for those seeking the escape of a good scary movie. Its more like a poor mans Shining with some lame Sixth Sense and Omen elements thrown in. The movie opens with a tragedy An attractive couple (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos and Greg Kinnear) lose their 8-year-old son (Cameron Bright) in a terrible accident. In the midst of their grief they are approached by a scientist/doctor (De Niro) who was Romijn-Stamos professor in graduate school. Thats strange because shes a photographer and its her husband who has gone into biology but thats the least of the implausibilities. ABOUT THE MOVIE Godsend   (out of four) Stars Robert De Niro Greg Kinnear Rebecca Romijn-Stamos Director Nick Hamm Distributor Lions Gate Films Rating PG-13 for violence including frightening images a scene of sexuality and some thematic material Opens Friday nationwide The good doctor offers to bring their dead son back to life. The science is appropriately murky One stem cell of the deceased boy is used to clone a sufficient number of cells to regenerate him. The couple decide to undergo this secretive and illegal procedure which requires they sever ties with everyone. De Niro puts them up in a gorgeous lakefront home in Vermont and fills it with tasteful furniture. He finds a job for Kinnear at a local school. The child thrives until hes 8 and then things go haywire. The best that can be said about the film is that its naturalistic look and dark hues are occasionally intriguing and its twist is fairly unpredictable if far-fetched. But then most of the movie is far-fetched. That makes for inadvertent humor which almost makes the movie worth seeing. But the melodrama overrides all. Besides an overbearing score Godsend has a plethora of horror cliches a spooky shed filled with ominous farm tools and the requisite eerie child who has frightening visions and a vicious alter ego. Kinnear does his level best in a thankless role. Theres an unintentionally hilarious segment in which he researches the origins of his sons alter ego and finds a spooky woman whose somber oratorical style contrasts with the most blatant product placement since FedEx in Cast Away. Romijn-Stamos mostly stands around looking stricken and De Niro is over the top. Its hard to believe he needs a paycheck this badly. The movie is so low-tech that the cloning procedure looks like such an uncomplicated maneuver requiring no personnel save De Niro. No good could come from that. Perhaps the parents would have done well to remember the words of Woody Allen in Sleeper ""Never clone alone.""

There is now a plausible creep factor to the question of how much you is contained in your cells. Godsend unfortunately blows every chance for lurid psychological fun. When Paul and Jessie Duncan (Greg Kinnear and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) lose their 8-year-son Adam (Cameron Bright) in a car accident they agree to let Dr. Richard Wells (Robert De Niro) head of the secretive Godsend Fertility Clinic mastermind a cloned pregnancy from the dead boys DNA. The new Adam is the spitting image of the old one but the resemblance ends there. The first Adam smiled a lot and was partial to stegosaurs and pumped athletic shoes; his clone stares sullenly and draws a crayon picture of a building on fire. He also has nightmares in which hes menaced by what appears to be a malevolent twin. Meet the new Adam Sensitive Omen Kid. None of this is very compelling since theres virtually no personality overlap between Adam and his clone. Were just seeing the umpteenth recycled shocker about a mystical dark child with an aura of disaster. De Niro who tries to make Wells so bland that hes sinister succeeds only at the first half of that equation. Kinnear and Romijn-Stamos arent terrible but when actors this sleek looking have to do this much grieving you never quite forget that youre watching actors. A good human-replication thriller may yet be on the horizon but not if it clones as many bad ideas as ""Godsend"" does.
