In an extremely challenging role that calls for her to appear in almost every frame Annette Bening gives a riveting performance as a woman whose mind is invaded by supernatural forces. Dark scary and uncompromising Neil Jordans ""In Dreams"" is a wildly eccentric picture a metaphysical horror tale thats likely to intrigue cerebral viewers but will frustrate the more typical horror crowd fond of ""Scream"" and its offshoots. In an extremely challenging role that calls for her to appear in almost every frame Annette Bening gives a riveting performance as a bright married career woman whose mind is invaded by irrational and supernatural forces. Well-mounted with startling imagery from ace lenser Darius Khondji DreamWorks release should enjoy a decent opening but iffy reviews and unenthusiastic word-of-mouth will curtail B.O. due to an intense convoluted narrative with a downbeat tone and shockingly unconventional ending which doesnt provide the genres customary pay-off. ""In Dreams"" is not as flawed as Jordans other big budget Hollywood movies but it lacks the coherence and creative control of most of his small-scale Irish pictures. Mining similar terrain as ""The Company of Wolves"" a horror film structured as an adult fairy tale Jordans new effort -- which also works as a fairy tale -- might be similarly dismissed as seedy lurid and mean-spirited. Though the script which concerns the relatively unexplored and scientifically taboo realm of clairvoyance is based on a novel and written in collaboration with Bruce Robinson those familiar with Jordans work will be able to detect familiar thematic motifs lost childhood the haunting of the mind by irrational and unconscious forces gender-bending and cross-dressing the inextricable effect of the past on the present and above all unusual pairings and psychological ambiguity. Opening credits reveal a watery ghost town entirely buried by floods decades ago. The underwater motif enhances the yarns dimension of a hideous seemingly forgotten past that comes to haunt the present residents of a now-idyllic pastoral town. Claire (Bening) a childrens books illustrator is married to a loving pilot (Aidan Quinn) and they have a young daughter Rebecca (Katie Sagona). But Claires modern marriage is strained by incessant dreams; even their lovemaking is interrupted by haunting images and sudden outbursts of violence. Claires recurrent dreams reveal themselves in snippets and fragments a little boy chained to a bed a girl kidnapped by a faceless adult in an orchard of red apples. During one of her hubbys business trips Claire dreams of her daughters disappearance and sure enough hours later Rebeccas body is lifted out of the lake by cops. In a manner of self-fulfilling prophecies every single nightmare of Claires materializes. Driven to find out the true nature of her dreams -- and those who annoyingly feed them -- she becomes increasingly obsessed eventually descending into madness and asylum institutionalization. It may not be a coincidence that Jordan a subversive filmmaker constructs all the characters that stand for rationality as male authority figures husband Cooper detective Jack Kay (Paul Guilfoyle) hospital doctor Stevens (Dennis Boutsikaris) and Dr. Silverman (Stephen Rea) a specialist brought in to work intimately with Claire. And like other Jordan pictures this one can be seen as a critique of the nuclear bourgeois family. A blend of psychological drama and supernatural horror ""In Dreams"" is a movie in which nothing is what it appears to be. Through eerily dark destiny the paths of Claire and a serial killer on the loose crisscross and their fates intertwine underscoring their duality as two sides of the human psyche with Claire representing the good and right and he the evil and wrong. Final reel which is the weakest and most overheated visually is confined to a cider factory where Claire confronts her torturer. Echoing elements of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and far more respectful of generic conventions than earlier segments finale is directed in an amusingly self-conscious and reflexive manner allowing horror aficionados to have a smile or two while watching some of the most frightening moments a result of the excessively quirky dialogue and some over-the-top acting. Taken seriously ""In Dreams"" provides a wry commentary on the medical and psychiatric professions both quick to label Claires conduct as delusional if not paranoid. The film also refutes such established notions as scientific progress and rational pragmatism. Viewers skeptical of the films more metaphysical themes should still be able to appreciate the sense of dread that permeates the entire yarn. From the start in a shrewdly Hitchcockian manner Jordan implicates the viewers placing them in Claires subjective mind as they are the only ones to see the terrifying validity of her dreams. In whats arguably her most commanding role since ""The Grifters"" Bening is perfectly cast as a recognizably contempo woman whose mind and life disintegrate to a point of no return. With limited screen time mostly in the last reel Robert Downey Jr. reps the underbelly of the dream world an adult who has never really grown up still childlike misinformed desperate to connect. Rea a Jordan regular renders a low-key understated performance as the doctor who initially symbolizes the rational element of culture until his value system utterly collapses under the crushing evidence. Rest of the supporting ensemble is equally impressive. Reversing Hollywoods depiction of dream sequences -- usually in black-and-white -- lenser Khondji goes wild with colors objects and textures. Color separation is achieved with filters that distort images giving them a richly saturated almost surreal feel. Though red dominates each dream is staged and filmed in a radically different style some with hand-held camera others like still tableaux. Shot in the fall in Massachusetts Pioneer Valley New Hampshire North Carolina Tennessee (for its dams) and Rosarito Mexico (for the ghost town covered in water) pic represents one of DreamWorks most elaborately produced efforts with superb technical values across the board.

Starring Annette Bening Aidan Quinn Stephen Rea and Robert Downey Jr. Directed by Neil Jordan. (R. 100 minutes.) Annette Bening has been getting good roles in good movies for 10 years now but the part she has in ""In Dreams"" is her juiciest yet. The picture is a 100-minute showcase for nonstop powerhouse acting. Fear. Pain. Betrayal. Terror. Wailing grief. Suicidal despair. Hysteria. Bening goes to all those places and thats just in the first 40 minutes as a woman looking for her missing daughter in the woods. ""In Dreams"" provides the double thrill of feeling deeply for someone whos suffering even as we savor the bigness of the torment. Bening plays Claire a smiling upper-middle-class wife and mother who has been having disturbing dreams. She keeps seeing the hand of a child killer leading a little girl into the woods. Because she is clairvoyant she knows something bad is about to happen but she doesnt know where or to whom. She finds out in a hurry when her adorable daughter disappears and is found at the bottom of a river the next day. The premise of ""In Dreams"" sounds like that of a bad Stephen King movie a serial killer establishes a psychic link with a woman and keeps sending her visions of future murders. But director Neil Jordan (""The Crying Game"") who co- wrote the script doesnt milk it for cheap thrills. He treats the story with sobriety and genuine cinematic subtlety. Benings performance makes that of Robert Downey Jr. as the serial killer look studied and protected. ..

In Dreams Movie Review amp; Film Summary (1999) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/in-dreams-1999,200,indreams7,indreams,rogerebert
"In Dreams (R) Related Item ""In Dreams"" showtimes Nightmarishly Good Dreams By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday January 15 1999 Robert Downey Jr. dwells in an emotionally harrowing cinematic dreamscape. (DreamWorks) Director Neil Jordan Cast Annette Bening; Robert Downey Jr.; Stephen Rea; Aidan Quinn; Paul Guilfoyle Running Time 1 hour 40 minutes For violence sexual scenes nudity and profanity ""In Dreams"" Neil Jordans surrealistic thriller which stars Annette Bening in an exhausting breakout performance follows its genre requirements with such insulting woodenness you know something else is going on. How could the maker of ""Interview With the Vampire"" ""The Crying Game"" and ""Mona Lisa"" display such robotic adherence to form without meaning to? Methinks there is method to the madness and quite possibly madness behind that. The scenario is a throwaway structure - a child lost a mother whose psychic abilities are used to track the killer the grungy detective the friendly psychiatrist blah blah blah. But poke through the cavernous ribs of this formula and greater things are revealed. Claire Cooper (Bening) has an idyllic New England life. Shes married to a devoted husband who flies 747s. She has a lovely daughter (Katie Sagona) who is excited about her coming role in the school play. But Claire has been experiencing dreams and visions that connect her to traumatic events of the past and tragically the future. When she tries to convey these visionary warnings shes treated with insensitivity by her husband and incredulousness by the local detective (Paul Guilfoyle). Then the unspeakable happens the worst that can happen to a parent. The Coopers are devastated. Claire with the help of the aforementioned sensitive psychiatrist (Stephen Rea) finds herself linked even closer to the mysterious being that has caused her so much pain. She also finds herself with disconcertingly easy access to three worlds. There is the ""real"" one in which everyone seems remote helpless or vaguely suspect. There is the watery ghost town of Northfield which was submerged to create a reservoir in the 1960s but which still percolates with tortured memories for her adversary. And there is the spiritual dimension where she can astrally visit the past present and future. As Claire Bening plunges wholeheartedly into a whirlpool of madness distress and clairvoyance her People magazine dignity be damned. She leaves us unsettled rather than touched; we wonder whether shell emerge sane or insane defeated or triumphant. As her counterbalance Robert Downey Jr. brings an extra eerie dimension to his performance born of his well-publicized struggles with addiction. But he more than admirably holds up his end of the movies equation. Jordan and his co-screenwriter Bruce Robinson have created an emotionally harrowing experience that seems equal parts artistic subversion savage genius and sheer nastiness. And director of photography Darius Khondji who created stunning work in ""Seven"" ""Delicatessen"" and ""The City of Lost Children"" gives breathtaking form to that strange agenda. Jordan is an odd but hypnotic dreamer. He pulls us into a nasty nightmare refusing to turn the lights back on when hes through. But then this is a film about breaking through to the other side. Why should we - the audience - ever get back to Kansas? Movies of the last 20 years (especially thrillers) have become so slickly routine they have molded our sensibilities into a conventional almost crabby set of expectations. A shake-up like this can only be good for the system - ours and Hollywoods. If youre interested in the cinematic equivalent of white-water rafting I say take the plunge.

No longer. In Neil Jordans dismayingly schlocky and literal-minded thriller In Dreams Claire Cooper (Annette Bening) a small-town wife and mother hallucinates her young daughters murder and days later the awful premonition comes true. But Claires dreams dont stop. The killers psyche has gotten inside her and she is overwhelmed by visions of storybook terror a nightmare apple orchard eerie underwater plunges moldering hallways with nasty surprises behind the doors many more apples still. The movie is overwhelmed as well. Benings flash-cut blood reveries while lushly designed and photographed arrive with such joyless regularity that the film never quite establishes a compelling reality for them to disrupt. Jordan may think hes making Dont Look Now but what he ends up with is A Nightmare on Elm Street 14 -- a rock-video gothic crowned by the image of Robert Downey Jr. as the longhaired killer working hard to act threatening; its not in his emotional vocabulary. The talented Bening has the thankless task of having to go choppy-haired hysterical as Claires visions convince everyone around her that shes a delusional psychotic. If there had been a touch of ambiguity about the issue she might have seemed a gripping head case rather than a mere victim.

I can remember when Martin Scorsese used to talk about how he survived the big-time filmmaking game by directing one movie for ""them"" (the bottom-line-loving studios) then one for himself. The big shots are more likely to throw you a bone if youve been known to cooperate when duty calls and if youre a proven artist it doesnt hurt to keep you happy anyway. For instance hed buckle down and shoot ""The Color of Money"" (big stars big budget high commercial hopes) as a sort of pre-penance that would then allow him to make ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" (naughty story about Jesus Harvey Keitel as Judas wont make a dime). Its no coincidence that Scorseses currently making a movie starring Nicolas Cage as a drug-addicted New York City ambulance driver. His last movie was (""zzzzzzzz"") ""Kundun."" RELATED VIDEO Watch the theatrical preview for ""In Dreams"" Windows Media 28K 80K Neil Jordan seems to work it this way too except that he usually does a couple for himself then a couple for them. And boy the ones hes done for them havent turned out very well. Ever seen ""High Spirits"" or maybe ""Were No Angels?"" I didnt think so. Not very good but has atmosphere The closest Jordans ever come to pulling things off in a hugely commercial way (outside of the surprise success of ""The Crying Game"") is ""Interview with the Vampire"" a project that was so pre-sold when filming commenced Lucy Ricardo probably could have turned it into a hit. It wasnt very good but it had a lot of atmosphere and thats about as much as you should expect to get out of Jordans latest movie for ""them"" ""In Dreams."" It stars Annette Bening as an apple-fixated woman whos frazzled out of her head when things first kick into gear. Dont worry though; she gets progressively worse from there. Bening plays Claire yet another of those unlucky folks (the kind you only find in the movies) who suddenly start seeing crimes through the eyes of a brutal killer. Thereve been a thousand variations on this one over the years everything from ""The Eyes of Laura Mars"" to David Cronenbergs often-marvelously cinematic adaptation of Stephen Kings ""The Dead Zone."" ""In Dreams"" save for a few moments of effective imagery adds very little to the stew. It seems like Jordan is shooting for something on the order of Nicolas Roegs unsettling ""Dont Look Now"" (even down to his strategic use of the color red) but what hes wound up with is more like ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" for adults. And Robert Downey Jr. of all people plays Freddie Krueger An apple phobia Claire you see has been having strange disjointed dreams about a child whos gone missing recently. Shes convinced that shes seeing someone murder the kid in an apple orchard but shes not really sure. (Her husband an airline pilot played by Aidan Quinn rightfully assumes shes a crackpot.) The apple motif appears repeatedly throughout the film usually to less-than-inspiring effect. One particularly absurd moment consists of Claire falling into a screaming fit and sweeping hundreds of shiny red apples off of her kitchen table and onto the floor. Then she desperately tries to cram them into the trash compactor all at the same time. Anyone who has a trash compactor knows that this is a bad idea. Stinky-looking brown water suddenly spews from the drain and partially mashed-up apples are sprayed all over the walls and floor. Professional cleaning women will undoubtedly scream in horror. Everyone else will just giggle over a woman whos overcome by apple sauce. Eventually Claire decides shes somehow privy to murders that somebody else is about to commit and that special somebody is inserting these visions into her head. Theres one pretty scary scene where Claires little girl disappears after a school play and the cops fan out through the woods looking for her as Claire wails inconsolably. When the daughter is found at the bottom of a nearby lake Claire knows that shell have to find the murderer or the dreams will never stop. Or maybe she just wants revenge. Benings character isnt much help. She does little more than shriek at the top of her lungs for most of the movie. I cant say that I blame her but I started to get as rattled as she was after a while for all the wrong reasons. Coherent but shrill The rest is coherent but in a very shrill manner. Stephen Rea shows up eventually just like he does in every other Neil Jordan movie. This time however hes playing a psychiatrist with a thick New York (New Jersey?) accent one that adds absolutely nothing to the character. Its basically an empty gesture. For the first time that I know of Rea seems bored on screen rather than just photogenically soul-sick. (The psychiatric hospital that he works at by the way looks more like a dungeon than a hospital. Bening gets trussed up and locked away in a manner that would have ""60 Minutes"" breathing down the doctors necks before they could say ""American Medical Association."") Theres a plot device concerning a town that was flooded when the lake was originally put in and it makes for some nice imagery. The imagery is all there is to it though. By the time Downey showed up looking like a cross between the bass player for a grunge band and one of those fops on a Three Musketeers candy bar I couldnt have cared less. Jordans poetry (what little there was in evidence anyway) finally becomes nothing more than action and noise. Weve got 2000 other directors who can manage that. ""In Dreams"" might be pretty disturbing if youre in the right mood. Or if you terrified of apples. Theres violence bad language and sex and its all presented in a ominous manner. When all is said and done its really just an ugly-spirited drag. Rated R. 100 minutes.
