Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jul. 15 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 240PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Like its pot-bellied little protagonist the new Disney film Winnie the Pooh is faithful familiar and with a running time of little more than an hour short. Made in relaxing two-dimensions with pastel-coloured illustrations and uncomplicated character motives this is Winnie the Pooh more or less as we remember him from childhood. Movies Winnie the Pooh The official trailer After the action-flick plots of the last two Pixar films Toy Story 3 and Cars 2 Disney under animation head John Lasseter has tipped his hat to Disney animation tradition. Based on Ernest H. Shepards original illustrations of A.A. Milnes books from the 1920s the style here shows little change from the series that ran on television and the Disney movies over the past 50 years. So yes adults fearful of CGI revisionism and modern Shrek-style in-jokes can relax This is not the version of Pooh where he and Eeyore go on Oprah to talk about eating disorders and depression. On the other hand Disney doesnt offer much here that it hasnt done as well before. The narrative cobbled together from various Pooh stories by an army of writers is held together reasonably well by John Cleeses soothing narration. We begin with Pooh (the querulous voice of Jim Cummings) waking up hungry as usual. When he goes on a quest for honey he finds Eeyore (Bud Luckey) feeling even more miserable than usual because he has lost his tail. The forest animals - including the excitable Piglet (Travis Oates) the pedantic Owl (Craig Ferguson) the motherly Kanga (Kristen Anderson-Lopez) and rambunctious Tigger (Cummings again) - join in a hunt for the tail. They are distracted when Pooh finds a misspelled note from Christopher Robin saying he will be ""back soon."" Owl misinterprets the writing and the animals now believe the forest is inhabited by a fierce creature called a ""Backson"" which they set out to trap with the expected screw-ups. The old-fashioned illustrations are charming and the tricks with on-screen text are clever but the narrative is too thin to sustain much adult interest. As compensation the filmmakers have included a couple of musical numbers that are animated in different styles. The best tune The Backson Song is handled with an ingenious chalkboard animation sequence For the song Everything is Honey sung by Pooh the bear hero wears a bee-striped suit and imagines himself visiting a golden honey-dripping island paradise (reminiscent of The Simpsons episode in which Homer has a deep-sea chocolate experience). As well the reliably winsome Zooey Deschanel performs a couple of numbers including a warm if wobbly version of the old Sherman Brothers title song over the closing credits. Winnie the Pooh is accompanied by another short animated film reminiscent of the Disney style of the early fifties (especially 1950s Cinderella). The Ballad of Nessie told as an illustrated poem is the story of how Nessie and her duck friend MacQuack ended up in Loch Ness when they were kicked out of their original home. The pink blue and green pastels are gentle on the eyes though the doggerel poem recited by Billy Connolly is like falling into a loch full of twee. Winnie the Pooh Directed by Stephen J.

""Winnie the Pooh"" is a very full jar of honey indeed. The new animated take on several unfilmed A.A. Milne stories is a perfectly scaled little delight. The cartoon cleverly integrates printed text illustrations and page layouts from the books with onscreen mischief to captivating effect. When Pooh Piglet Owl and the rest find themselves stuck in a hole they even fashion an escape ladder out of vowels and consonants that tumbled in after them. What better example could you want of the value of literacy? The film supervised by Disney-Pixars chief creative officer John Lasseter offers a bit of damage control for his reputation following the wan effort that was ""Cars 2."" The Pooh movies cuddly tone will rekindle the affection of parents for the dear old teddy bear and capture the imaginations of new readers who are meeting him for the first time. There is mild suspense as the animal friends misunderstand a note from Christopher Robin and imagine he has been taken prisoner by a creature called the Backson. The tale is a cheerfully moral-free lesson in tolerant sociability and with a brisk 73-minute runtime it wont bring on too many attacks of the squirmies. Narrator John Cleese dilutes the sugary buildup with a drop of testiness. Only the peppy pop-tinged soundtrack lags a little; despite fine breathy vocals by Zooey Deschanel there isnt a keeper in the bunch.  out of four stars Rating G RottenTomatoes.com read reviews Showtimes view listings TOPP TWINS UNTOUCHABLE GIRLS Identical-twin entertainers Lynda and Jools Topp sing harmony like a single voice in stereo and tickle their enthusiastic audiences with inspired nonsense between numbers. As New Zealands leading country amp; western lesbian sisters act since the 1980s theyve attained a unique long-lasting celebrity on stage and TV. Now as stars of their own documentary theyre taking their infectious brand of gay-positive entertainment worldwide. Theyre a two-woman comedy troupe with a stock company of characters that range from boozed-up society matrons to fussbudget sleepaway camp counselors to a pair of good-ol-Kiwi ranchers named Ken and Ken. The film interviews the twins now-elderly mom and dad who werent thrilled that they wouldnt be having grandchildren but accommodated themselves to the facts of their daughters lives with love. With a cheeky attitude and a live-and-let-live message the Topps are irresistible ambassadors for New Zealand where a daft sense of humor appears to be a key natural resource.  1/2 out of four stars Unrated; mature themes Theater Lagoon RottenTomatoes.com read reviews Showtimes view listings View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

G. 1 hour 13 minutes. At area theaters. One would have to have a heart of cold temperament to find much -- if anything -- wrong with the animated adventure ""Winnie the Pooh."" Oh sure we could describe A.A. Milnes honey-hued ""bear of very little brain"" as a honey addict and peg his fellow inhabitants of Hundred Acre Wood as enablers. But like we said wed be terrific curmudgeons to wander down that lane. Voiced winningly by Jim Cummings Pooh is as his theme song assures us a ""Tubby little cubby all stuffed with fluff."" And the G in the rating might as well stand for gentle and generous. Brought to you by some of the Disney folk who delivered last months noisy flashy ""Cars 2"" this hand-drawn tale is as elegantly simple as that sequel is voraciously impressively computer-rendered. How can a slash of eyebrows and two dots for eyes be so darn expressive? And yet they are. After opening with a lingering loving survey of human friend Christopher Robins bedroom ""Winnie the Pooh"" slips seamlessly into an animated world. ""Monty Python"" wit John Cleese narrates. And directors Don Hall and Steve Anderson are wonderfully mindful of Poohs roots in the written word. The movie moves back and forth from pages to screen sometimes showing us an illustrated book. Other times letters even characters slip off the page into the world of the Hundred Acre Wood. At the start our hero awakens famished and hungering for honey. ""Honey"" is a word Pooh says again and again. Its a hope a mantra a persistent wish to be fulfilled. It will be of course in due time. The adventure here is twofold. Initially Christopher Robin (voiced by Jack Boulter) suggests a contest to replace sullen donkey Eeyores tail which has gone missing. Its all fun games and invention. But then something darker happens. A creature called The Backson has absconded with Christopher Robin reports Owl (voiced aptly by late-night host Craig Ferguson). Whatever will Tigger Rabbit Eeyore Owl Piglet Kanga pocket-size Roo and that tubby cubby do? (""Pooh"" is preceded by ""The Ballad of Nessie"" an animated rhyming fable -- heavy on the brogue please--about losing a watery home and searching for another.)

"Winnie the Pooh review Gentle new film does right by Winnie and his friends |       NJ.com comments Winnie the Pooh review Gentle new film does right by Winnie and his friends Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on July 15 2011 at 808 AM View/Post Comments Disney EnterprisesLeft to right Rabbit Kanga Roo Piglet Owl Winnie the Pooh Christopher Robin MOVIE REVIEW In a world of time wasters this might actually be a good internet quiz What Pooh character are you? Are you an Owl? (Formal literate verbose.) A Tigger? (Upbeat antic unfocused.) A Kanga? (Sweet patient maternal.) An Eeyore? (Quiet solitary pessimistic.) Dorothy Parker who reviewed some of the original A.A. Milne stories for the New Yorker wasnt any of them. After reading pages featuring cute names and baby talk she told readers she ""fwowed up."" But the books are still sentimental favorites of anyone who encountered them as a child. So are the cartoons although of course they were immediately Disneyfied -- the original scratchy artwork turned soft and sweet and songs were interjected at every turn. Movie Review Winnie the Pooh (G) Disney (68 min.) Directed by Stephen J. Anderson Don Hall. Narrated by John Cleese. Now playing in New Jersey. Rating note The film contains nothing to offend. Stephen Whittys Review THREE STARS ""Winnie the Pooh"" restarts the franchise after years of the silly old bear being shunted aside by princess epics and Pixar masterpieces. And its a surprisingly solid often charming effort. A hand-drawn one too which is lovely. As sophisticated as computer animation has become the results can still look a little cold and plastic. The real Pooh and Co. were made of stuffing and stitches and they need the beautiful imperfections of a brush and paint pot. The story as it always was with Pooh is slight -- and reprises some adventures weve seen before. Hungry Winnie is out of honey. Glum Eeyore is missing his tail. Tigger is out of control. Tigger of course is always out of control in the Disney adventures; probably sensing a connection with its target audience Disney has always tended to give the mischievous creature an oversized role. (Personally I always preferred Eeyore but you probably could have guessed that.) But the crew of mostly unsung vocal actors (all given the thankless job of impersonating the long-gone performers who did the first movie 45 years ago) is delightful. So is the art which includes a beautiful sequence done as if in chalk. Another nice touch is that the movie brings the book into play using pages as backdrops and having the characters interact with them -- slipping off paragraphs getting bonked by falling letters. Its a nice subtle reminder that words count. So of course does value and Disney skimps a bit on that here -- the whole program lasts barely over an hour and thats with credits and the addition of a dull pseudo-Seuss short ""The Ballad of Nessie."" Then again its doubtful that the preschool and kindergarten set would sit still for much more. And -- with their older siblings off at ""Harry Potter"" this weekend -- thats probably exactly the audience this gently undemanding film is aimed at.

(Disney) Joe Neumaier Friday July 15 2011 400 AM Title Winnie the Pooh Oh bother This is the moment when we have to say that those four stars for Disneys new ""Winnie the Pooh"" are for kids at about that age or younger and that it is in fact the perfect first movie to bring a preschooler to gentle and lulling and yes as sweet as honey.But the truth is that parents may find these giggle-filled episodes featuring the bear of very little brain his human friend Christopher Robin and the rest of the gang in the Hundred Acre Wood a kind of a balm as well.As nice as it is to introduce youngsters to movie magic via savvy state-of-the-art adventures like ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" or ""Rango"" by midsummer and the second viewing of ""Cars 2"" family filmgoing can become as welcome as attending another raucous birthday party at Chuck E. Cheeses.So at a Roo-size 68 minutes and preceded by a cute short called ""The Ballad of Nessie"" this new ""Pooh"" is comforting indeed.It has sweet songs (""A Pooh Bear Takes Care of His Tummy"" is just one) some wry and enjoyable narration from John Cleese and an appreciation for the wordplay in the A.A. Milne stories in which the yellowish stuffed bear first appeared over 80 years ago (and which if anyone ever felt like doing line-for-line adaptations would make some wonderfully melancholy short films).More than once Pooh finds himself traipsing across sentences paragraphs and tumbling words; theres even a ladder of letters that comes in handy.Since Pooh made the leap to featurettes in 1966 -- which is where he acquired his too-small red T-shirt -- and movies in 77 a pot of honey has usually been his goal and thats still the case. Theres also camaraderie and conflict-solving with Piglet Rabbit and Owl a search for sad-sack Eeyores tail and a hunt for a creature called ""the Backson"" (a misreading of a note that says ""back soon"" and actually just a tick scary for the very smallest of audiences.) But everything is resolved with very little drama and some flouncing and pouncing from Tigger.Veteran voice actor Jim Cummings does a fine approximation of Sterling Holloways original Pooh intonations and after a quick CG-animated introduction to the beloved toys in Christopher Robins room the old-fashioned artwork is in its own way a real treat.Theres no bells and whistles here no 3-D or useless grey fluff just Pooh as hes always been silly and true.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Milnes lovable stuffed bear gets re-stuffed in this all-new animated story from Disney. Starring Jim Cummings Craig Ferguson Director Stephen J. Anderson Don Hall Running time 103 Release Opened Jul 15 2011  Editorial Review This Pooh is worth a botherBy Sandie Angulo ChenFriday July 15 2011Summer family movies generally tend to be huge Pixar-scale productions or pandering duds so its a relief to see one of our favorite childhood stories retold with old-school simplicity and obvious joy. Disneys new take on the adorable honey-loving ""Winnie the Pooh"" is a memorable return to the Hundred Acre Wood and a lively interactive adventure that should delight everyone from wide-eyed preschoolers to nostalgic grandparents.Inspired by the simplified lines and water-color palette of Disneys original Pooh cartoons this hand-drawn tale opens with a narrator (perfectly poshly voiced by John Cleese) introducing us to Winnie the Pooh (Jim Cummings) a tubby little cubby who single-mindedly thinks about feeding his grumbly tummy some honey. But Pooh must put his honey-quest on hold when he encounters his melancholy donkey pal Eeyore (Bud Luckey) whos missing his gray tail. Pooh rounds up his entire enchanted neighborhood crew (bashful Piglet bouncy Tigger mother-and-child Kanga and Roo know-it-all Owl and sensible if easily exasperated Rabbit) to embark on a competitive search for Eeyores replacement tail with Christopher Robin offering a pot of honey as a reward.The film offers several visual treats of Eeyore trying several unworkable though amusing appendages. After reading a note left by Christopher Robin Owl (Craig Ferguson sounding appropriately pompous) manages to convince everyone that their human friend has been kidnapped by a hairy horned beast the ""Backson"" of Pooh lore. Owl cements his concerns by leading a trippy cartoon-within-a-cartoon musical sequence (think ""Pink Elephants on Parade"" but without the hallucinatory creepiness) detailing the monsters more formidable traits. Somewhat abruptly the woodland pals redirect their energy away from the tail-replacement project to conduct a military-style mission to capture the monster and rescue Christopher Robin. Clocking in at a zippy 63 minutes the story is precisely the right length for squirmy tots and concludes before the minimal plot grows stale for adults. Over the hour the writers include plenty of laughs for grown-ups and older children as well. After several renditions of a musical ditty threaten to annoy Kanga sensibly suggests just in time for both her friends and the audience ""How about we celebrate with silence?"" in a way only a fellow parent could appreciate. Eeyores deadpan gloom also contains doses of surprisingly funny black comedy. And in a brief but sophisticated wordplay the friends engage in a well-executed ""Whos on First"" routine that both parents and kids can appreciate -- and will undoubtedly repeat after the credits roll. Reflecting the way the characters in A.A. Milnes books spoke with the narrator Pooh Bear and his mates on-screen cleverly interact with the words on each displayed page crashing into the letters rearranging them as props and using them to communicate with the audience. The narrator regularly breaks the fourth wall creating an adaptation in which the words themselves turn into supporting players. This meta layering may however require some whispered explanations of omniscient narrators and cinematic voice-overs when the youngest audience members ask ""Whos that man talking?"" every time Cleese intones from off-screen.Combining the best of the innocent Pooh stories with a dash of parent-friendly humor this adorable throwback is as refreshingly tasty and sweet as well honey.Contains nothing objectionable.

The 1966-1974 ""Winnie the Pooh"" shorts that used to air on Disneys Sunday night program were thinly plotted simply drawn and replete with silly songs and jokes for third-graders. Why mess with perfection? Disneys big-screen ""Winnie the Pooh"" lovingly re-creates those delightful cartoons -- right down to the theme song the characters wandering out of their illustrations to toddle across the sentences of A.A. Milnes stories and even the imperishable voice of Pooh. Sterling Holloway who did those scratchy uncertain vocals has perished. But actor Jim Cummings has him down cold. At less than an hour before the credits the film hardly qualifies as a feature (it is preceded by an OK short about a friendly take on the Loch Ness monster her rubber ducky and a nasty Scottish developer named MacFroogle). But what price childhood regained? ""Winnie the Pooh"" instantly zapped me back to a Disneycentric upbringing (including five Orlando pilgrimages from Massachusetts) in which Sunday night belonged to Walt. Fellow Gen Xers If its between you and a 6-year-old to nab the last seat in the theater exercise the prerogatives of height and muscle and snag that precious upholstery. The movie begins with a soothing visit to a childs playroom decorated as it might have been in the 1930s complete with stuffed bear belonging to one Christopher Robin. Ever so gently we float away on John Cleeses narration of Poohs discovery that Eeyores tail has gone missing. All of the Hundred Acre Wood gang are here. Piglet that redoubtable lieutenant is always willing to defer to his rotund friend even when Winnie has contrived to get him stuck in a beehive. Piglet making the best of matters says its quite peaceful inside as long as no sudden movements disturb the bees. Cue the Pooh desperately whacking away with a stick. Owl (nice job by Craig Ferguson) as useless as any graduate student is working on his lengthy memoirs. (""Chapter One Birth of a Genius."") And for real graduate students there is rich fodder for contemplation in the way the characters break the fourth wall egged on by Cleeses gently mad narration. Psych students might consider the manic-depressive dynamic of Tigger and Eeyore. ""Were all gonna die"" says Eeyore when everyone is stuck in a pit. Was Charlie Brown ever more clear-sighted than the donkey in his visions of doom? Was Snoopy ever more sybaritic and spring-loaded than the kinetic tiger who declares ""Consider yourself pounced""? After the friends hold a contest to discover the best substitute tail for Eeyore (candidates include a cuckoo clock an umbrella and a balloon that carries him away) they find a note from Christopher Robin that only Owl claims to be able to read. But C.R.s promise to be ""back soon"" is according to Owl a warning that he has been kidnapped by a ""backson."" These monsters everyone soon decides in a dazzling sequence designed to look like chalk drawings on a blackboard are responsible for everything from the scribbles in your books to your habit of sleeping late. They eat your snacks; they wont relax. This is all as pure and sunny as lemonade and Zooey Deschanels citrusy sweetness as she contributes several songs is a nice touch. This is the closest the movie comes to being contemporary which given Deschanels retro vibe is not very. She and everyone else involved are content to spirit us back to 1966-1974 an age without iPhones or alarmingly hip tweens. All we had to worry about was civil unrest political assassinations Vietnam and Watergate. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Sara Bareilles joins The Sing-Off as new judge Read Next Sara Bareilles joins The Sing-Off as new judge Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 46924 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 19318 16 feared dead in Texas hot air balloon crash 18679 College student kills 3 in house party shooting cops Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Milnes Winnie-the-Pooh books are theres little question that most of the people currently living were first exposed to the characters through Walt Disneys adaptations of them. If a new Pooh flick is to succeed with viewers it has to capture the spirit of those cartoons from the 1960s and 70s and not necessarily the spirit of the books. (Fortunately the two spirits are pretty similar.) Poohs gentle friendly voice the familiar theme song the simple animation -- thats where the nostalgia is. I am pleased to report that the new feature simply titled Winnie the Pooh (ditching the hyphens was the most serious change Disney made to the Milne formula) re-creates the look and feel of the old cartoons about as faithfully as could be expected given the deceased nature of most of the original voice cast. Knowing the Disney company I assume they were tempted at some point to produce a hip 21st-century Pooh -- Pooh the Xtreme -- with a jive-talking Rabbit and a skateboarding Tigger all produced with computers and shown in 3-D and featuring a soundtrack by Maroon 5. But any such temptations were repressed. What we have instead is hand-drawn animation jaunty songs an uncomplicated story and a sweetly child-like sense of humor and wonderment. In short classic Pooh. You will recognize the elements of the plot immediately. Pooh (voice of Jim Cummings) dangerously addicted to honey cannot find any in his home and goes looking to ""borrow"" some from his neighbors. Eeyore (Bud Luckey) the clinically depressed donkey has lost his tail so all the inhabitants of the Hundred-Acre Wood try to find a suitable replacement. Christopher Robin (Jack Boulter) is gone for the day but has left a note which the animals misunderstand sending them on a quest to rescue their pal from a nonexistent forest monster. Tigger (Jim Cummings again) the Kramer figure in this universe tries to teach Piglet (Travis Oates) how to be a Tigger too. Owl (Craig Ferguson) talks smarter than he is Rabbit (Tom Kenny) is flustered Kanga (Kristen Anderson-Lopez) and Roo (Wyatt Dean Hall) serve as good-natured background -- you know the routine. This is a childrens movie in the purest most magical sense appealing to the under-8 crowd by talking to them at their level. The conceit is that these are tales manufactured by Christopher Robin as he plays with his stuffed animals; hence no one is any more mature or sophisticated or worldly-wise than a little boy would be. The narrator (John Cleese) is the only adult influence on this play-world and he treads lightly setting our friends back on course gently and only when asked. There are no glaring of-the-moment pop-cultural references to date the film nothing that will remind you 20 years from now that it was made in 2011. (Unless you look at the credits I suppose Zooey Deschanel sings the classic theme song; the new tunes were written by Robert Lopez a Tony winner for Avenue Q and The Book of Mormon.) There is only sincerity and joy. As a kid I thought the Pooh characters awareness that they are in a book going so far as to interact with the typography on the pages was about the niftiest thing in the world. Im happy that device has been retained because its still awfully neat. Rabbit doesnt have a very large role in the story (and his voice doesnt sound right to me) and none of the songs are instant classics like ""The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers"" but you cant have everything can you? Apart from one or two sly references the movie makes almost no attempt to include material specifically for the adults in the audience -- and the adults in the audience who have fond memories of previous animated Pooh adventures will find that attitude all the more appealing. How could you be transported back to your childhood if you were constantly being peppered with jokes that only the adult you would understand? In a way it doesnt matter that the film is just for kids. When it does its job right everyone watching it is a kid.

Featuring the voices of Jim Cummings John Cleese and Bud Luckey. Directed by Stephen J. Anderson and Don Hall. (G. 65 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The makers of ""Winnie the Pooh"" had enough material for a good 65 minutes and so they did something unusual practically unheard of in modern times. They made a 65-minute movie. They didnt stretch things out for an additional half hour. Instead they took mercy on parents and were realistic about the attention span of their target audience and the result is a nice little movie that does its job and doesnt spread misery under cover of spreading joy. ""Winnie the Pooh"" is unusual in other ways too. Winnie does not come at you in three dimensions and the voices on the soundtrack are not of very famous people showing off. The animation is old school and the songs - its a musical - have a 1960s vibe. No they dont sound like Hendrix but rather like the music from childrens movies of the 60s and the overall feeling is of a world of innocence and of a movie that you can relax with. Accentuating the 1960s link is Jim Cummings as Pooh who in his vocal characterization pays tribute to Sterling Holloway who was the voice of Pooh in a number of movies. Like those earlier animations this is a straight-up childrens film and I mean children. Theres no bathroom humor for older kids entering that weird presexual age where the mere suggestion of flatulence sends them into laughing fits and there are no jokes meant to go over the kiddies heads. What will amuse parents instead is the cinematic oasis of something sane and kind to show their children. Related Stories Winnie the Pooh So Eeyore has misplaced his tail which makes him more depressed than usual and Winnie and his friends go looking for it. Along the way Winnie looks for honey and thats about it folks. Hes a little bear hes hungry but he wants to help his friend too. Thats all there is and all you need to know though Ill add too that this movie reminded me of being 6 and I liked the reminder. E-mail Mick LaSalle at mlasallesfchronicle.com.

Disney Enterprises Tigger left Kanga Roo Owl Rabbit Winnie the Pooh and Eeyore go in search of Eeyores tail. EnlargeClose Disney Enterprises Tigger left Kanga Roo Owl Rabbit Winnie the Pooh and Eeyore go in search of Eeyores tail. Even if they are filled with honey. With Harry Potter casting his final spell over theaters this weekend Winnie is the only star willing to challenge the boy wizard. Normally youd find at least a romantic comedy to counterprogram a cinematic colossus. Pooh stands alone. And while his movie doesnt stand a chance at the box office Pooh succeeds by embracing much of what modern films (including Potters) have largely forgotten old-fashioned movie pleasures. Like simplicity. Harry Potter for instance is fighting for his life his friends and fate of the human world. Pooh is looking for Eeyores tail. About the movie Winnie the Pooh    out of fourStars Jim Cummings Tom Kenny Bud Luckey Craig FergusonDirectors Stephen Anderson and Don Hall Distributor Walt Disney Rating G Running time 1 hour 8 minutesOpens Friday nationwide Like coloring-book images. The Potter film is a visual spectacle a fitting 3-D bon voyage meant to set the franchises already high visual watermarks. Pooh is unabashedly 2-D a proud cartoon of primary colors. While so much animation looks to make its world and inhabitants photo-real Pooh still looks much like the bear from 1926 when author A.A. Milne began his fantasy storybooks based on his son Christopher Robins stuffed toy. To the movies credit Pooh does little to change its character or its meandering stories. This isnt Hollywoods How the Grinch Stole Christmas or Cat in the Hat-- commercial bastardizations that have distilled the originals. Not here. Pooh and pals dont live in a real world They live in a book chat with the narrator hop from page to page build ladders out of discarded letters to search for that tail (taken innocently of course). At just 68 minutes Pooh is much in the frolicking spirit of the original Seuss stories and Schoolhouse Rock. Not that Pooh hasnt modernized some. It may be rated G but the film has some wonderful humor and animation particularly when Pooh is flummoxed. Speaking of the titular character Pooh is voiced by Jim Cummings a near pitch-perfect replacement for the late Sterling Holloway. Make no mistake The movie is for younger children. Any kid over 8 is likely going to have hat and wand by the car keys for the Potter matinee. But for parents not in the mood for lines and computer-generated spectacle this wonderfully playful film may have enough magic of its own.

Milne books about Christopher Robin and his stuffed animals as they learn life lessons amidst their adventures. The biggest of these lessons for Pooh at least is that there are actually some things more important than honey.With a classically drawn look reminiscent of the way Disney did Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree in 1966 this whimsical hour-plus film plays around with the books -- literally. Pooh (Jim Cummings) talks to the narrator (John Cleese) and all the animals climb in and out of the pages knocking down words and at one point assembling fallen letters into l-a-d-d-e-r which helps them climb out of a pit.Directed by Don Hall and Stephen Anderson a team led by legendary story writer Burny Mattinson who worked on the original weaves a few stories together. Those tales include the hunt for Eeyores lost tail along with new ones such as Tigger (also Cummings) Tigger-izing Eeyore (Bud Luckey) complete with springs and stripes to the dolorous donkeys dismay.The artful mix of old and new which extends to new songs alternating with the familiar Sherman brothers tunes gives the film a special kick. Kudos too to executive producer John Lasseter the chief creative officer for Disney Animation and Pixar who championed this return to hand-drawn animation.Lasseter serves as a reminder how Winnie the Pooh was the original Toy Story the film that blasted him and Pixar to infinity and beyond. But if Toy Storys tale of a boy and his toys was homage Lasseter returns the favor by perking up Pooh with Pixar attitude. Among the best bits When asked if he can knot small pieces of rope into a big one Piglet (Travis Oates) admits he ""cannot knot"" and Eeyore sighs that its ""all for naught.""No not for naught not at all.P.S.

"Winnie the Pooh Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie Review Winnie the PoohWinnie the Pooh is as traditional as such films come and likely will appeal to young children seeking another musical adventure with Pooh and friends in the Hundred Acre Wood.July 15 2011|By Gary Goldstein Special to the Los Angeles Times Winnie the Pooh is back in the aptly titled ""Winnie the Pooh."" (Disney Enterprises )There are two ways to consider ""Winnie the Pooh"" Disneys newest animated entry based on the beloved works of A.A. Milne. The first is to compare this gentle hand-drawn effort to the kind of splashy smart-mouthed CGI-driven a sometimes 3-D a- juggernauts many have come to expect from animated studio features. On that score ""Winnie the Pooh"" is going to seem like an awfully retro fairly juiceless affair. But if judged against its 85-year-old source material and the various features featurettes TV shows and direct-to-DVD movies Disney has successfully extracted from it over the last five decades this current picture a the first ""Pooh"" installment crafted at the Walt Disney Animation Studios since 1977 a proves a fitting tribute to one of the last centurys most enduring childrens tales. Either way this musical comedys appeal will presumably top out with very young children and the nostalgic parents who escort them the latter of whom will likely appreciate the pictures ultra-brief running time 68 minutes including leisurely end credits and an opening eco-friendly cartoon called ""The Ballad of Nessie"" narrated by Billy Connolly. This latest ""Pooh"" directed by Stephen Anderson and Don Hall with watercolor-rich visuals true to E.H. Shepards original drawings was inspired by three stories from Milnes books which were adapted by a raft of story editors with veteran Disney staffer and ""Pooh"" animator Burny Mattinson serving as senior story artist (Pixar-Disney creative master John Lasseter executive produced). It all takes place during one eventful day in the Hundred Acre Wood the enchanted forest conjured up by Milnes equitable young protagonist Christopher Robin (stodgily voiced by Jack Boulter) where the English schoolboys stuffed animal collection comes to life. For the uninitiated Christopher Robins imaginary menagerie includes impulsive Tigger (Jim Cummings) gloomy Eeyore (Bud Luckey) pseudo-intellectual Owl (Craig Ferguson) fussy Rabbit (Tom Kenny) anxious Piglet (Travis Oates) maternal Kanga (Kristen Anderson-Lopez) her eager young son Roo (Wyatt Dean Hall) and of course that good-natured honey-obsessed ""bear of very little brain"" Winnie the Pooh (again Jim Cummings). This dizzy not terribly resourceful group finds itself facing a series of rudimentary obstacles mainly borne out of confusion and a pervasive bent for misspelling. Theres a somewhat ""Dumb and Dumber"" aspect at work here that frankly leaves one wishing for a wittier rehashing of life in the Hundred Acre Wood. Along the way Eeyore loses his donkey tail and needs a replacement Owl mistakenly thinks Christopher Robin has been abducted by a concocted monster dubbed a ""Backson"" and jelly-bellied Pooh tirelessly a and to be honest tiresomely a lusts after his elusive honey pots. Its predictable painless occasionally amusing fluff perked up by a clever visual interplay with the book text and John Cleeses avuncular narration. As for the music its largely standard issue starting with actress-musician Zooey Deschanels placid cover version of the Sherman Brothers classic title song (their ""The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers"" is also featured). Six original numbers by Robert Lopez (from Broadways Tony-winning ""Avenue Q"" and ""The Book of Mormon"" no less) and Anderson-Lopez are sweetly serviceable if unmemorable except for the energetic ""The Backson Song"" which provides for a standout segment. Be sure to stick around post-end credits as theres a cute moment that shouldve been included long before most viewers will probably be in the parking lot. calendarlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESNew Winnie the Pooh movie goes back to its Hundred Acre...July 13 2011A new Winnie-the-Pooh?

While its an obvious image given the title characters unending love of the stuff that sea of honey represents all the things that this movie thankfully avoided. The characters arent floating on saccharine nor is their craft being carried on tides of boogers and other bodily functions so beloved by the post-""Shrek"" spate of kid flicks. ""Winnie the Pooh"" is such a perfect morsel of entertainment -- appropriate for young children funny enough to keep their older siblings and parents laughing faithful to the original Disney short subjects (and the A.A. Milne/E.H. Shepard books on which they were based) -- that it defies cynicism. Or youll pardon the expression pooh-pooh-ing. This sweet low-key and utterly lovable movie reminds us that ""fun for all ages"" isnt just a marketing come-on. The film takes us through a typically jam-packed day in the Hundred Acre Wood. Pooh (voiced by Jim Cummings perfectly channeling Sterling Holloways iconic cadences) wakes up with a gurgling tummy and a house full of empty honeypots but theres no time for food Eeyores (Bud Luckey) tail has gone missing and Christopher Robin (Jack Boulter) proposes a contest where everyone will seek out a substitute. Alas neither Poohs cuckoo clock or a new tail knitted by Kanga (Kristen Anderson-Lopez who co-wrote new songs with her husband ""Avenue Q"" and ""The Book of Mormon"" composer Robert Lopez) or an umbrella or an anchor or a balloon or a chalkboard with T-A-E-L written on it by Owl (Craig Ferguson) will quite do the trick. And if the saga of Eeyores missing tail werent enough to keep everyone running around Owls misreading of a note from Christopher Robin (in which he said hed be ""back soon"") leads to a general panic about a creature called the Backson a hideous beast who puts holes in socks breaks toys scribbles in books and fiddles with your alarm clock so you oversleep. Everyone attempts to set a trap for the Backson while Tigger (Cummings again and his Paul Winchell is as good as his Sterling Holloway) puts a spring on Eeyores backside in an attempt to turn the perpetually-depressed donkey into a fighting ""Tigger Two."" If youre a fan of old-school Disney youll love the 2D watercolor-over-pencil-drawing look of the film not to mention the participation of animation vets like Burny Mattinson and Andreas Deja. The vintage Pooh tunes from the Sherman Brothers blend seamlessly with the new songs and even Zooey Deschanels vocals feel in this context more timeless than hipster. And while the whole enterprise is decidedly low-key its never dull or slow or dumbed-down. John Cleeses narration is puckish without ever being cruel or obvious and theres lots of visual playfulness from the Busby Berkeley-inspired musical number ""Everything is Honey"" to the way that the letters and paragraphs of the storybook in which this whole tale is taking place become comic props for the characters to stumble upon and even use to get themselves out of vexing situations. Theres something to be said about a movie particularly for children where theres not a single item on-screen that plugs in or runs on batteries. Popular cartoons that are so aggressively contemporary may appeal to young audiences in the now but their technology (to say nothing of their pop culture references) are going to horribly dated within a decade or two. It says something about the strength of the source material that Pooh doesnt have to carry an iPad -- and Tigger doesnt have to be played by an actual tiger with a computer-animated mouth -- for ""Winnie the Pooh"" to connect so strongly with audiences. The inclusion of Cleese and Ferguson incidentally plays less like the recent spate of lets-get-celebrity-voices and more in the tradition of simply casting the best voice actor for the part. They blend in with a spot-on ensemble (which also includes Travis Oates as Piglet Wyatt Dean Hall as Roo and Tom Kenny as Rabbit) rather than stand out with any kind of ""check it Im famous"" grandstanding. ""Winnie the Pooh"" is that rare movie that can be recommended to any and all. And if the film can withstand the onslaught of opening opposite the final chapter of the ""Harry Potter"" saga one hopes that Disney and the other animation studios will give us more ""Winnie the Pooh"" and less ""Mars Needs Moms.""

That is not an insult this Pooh which takes its gossamer plotlines directly from A.A. Milne will be a boon to parents of very small children everywhere. Unruly toddlers may be lulled into euphoria and go face first into the carpet. Its a good thing the film is only 69 minutes long or I might have succumbed to its gentle nostalgia and conked out to dream happily of my old bear. What happens? Pooh (brought to quavering perfection by veteran Pooh/Tigger Jim Cummings) is hungry. Eeyore (Bud Luckey) loses his tail. And thanks to Owl (Craig Ferguson) being his usual windbag self the creatures of the Hundred Acre Wood come to believe that adorable Christopher Robin must be saved from a non-existent beast called the Backson. All this amounts to close to nothing but then Milne intended life to be quiet in the Hundred Acre Wood. (See a photographic history of Winnie-the-Pooh.) This is a proper Pooh or as proper a Pooh as one could reasonably expect 85 years into the bears quite varied existence. For those of middle age the Pooh gold standard might be Disneys 1966 original Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree with Sterling Holloway voicing Pooh (Cumming sounds uncannily like him). A younger set grew up with Disneys crass Poohs the brightly colored bears who in the 1990s got the cheesy Bob Hope treatment in specials keyed to every holiday. Elementary school kids probably have the misfortune of knowing the oafish 21st century bear from My Friends Tigger amp; Pooh. (See the top 10 Disney controversies.) Its safe to assume that most of these later adventures would have made Poohs famously ambivalent creator blanch. (Milne stumbled onto the Pooh stories while working on more serious endeavors and could never escape its grip although he wanted to.) Back when I was a new parent they left me wondering what had happened to old Pooh bear. The makers of the new film share the same longing for the Pooh of the past Winnie the Pooh opens just as The Honey Tree did with a live-action pan of Christopher Robins bedroom -- neatly establishing how accessible a world like the Hundred Acre forest is to anyone with an imagination. Co-directors Stephen J. Anderson and Don Hall make their transitions between ""chapters"" look just the way Milnes books did with Ernest H. Shephards illustrations wedged between short paragraphs and dialogue. (Shephards is my true Pooh jointed and naked.) Then the illustrations come to life and the action flows with crisp and fluid animation. Its classically Disney as if Walt himself (actually John Cleese) were reading us a story. Timeless though it is Winnie the Poohs does nod to contemporary tastes with its soundtrack which includes actress/singer Zooey Deschanel crooning the theme song. Her part wont make much of an impact on children but parents can pretend for a moment that theyre sitting in a cool bar listening to Deschanels band She amp; Him do a semi-ironic -- but very beautiful -- rendition of a childhood favorite. Its a small twist of hipster in a satisfying old-school production. Mary Pols MaryPols Mary Pols has been reviewing film and occasionally books for TIME since 2009.

More about Winnie the Pooh >> And Winnie the Pooh the bear who can never get enough of that treat is still a sweet fixture for children. The longevity of the series can be credited to the freshness of its message and the characters relationships still touching and fun after all this time without being too sappy. Winnie the Pooh the first animated feature film in 35 years with the bear as the lead follows the lovable stuffed animals as they search for the lost tail of Eeyore the ever-depressed donkey. But that journey turns into a frantic quest to find Christopher Robin the child who owns and adores them and whom they believe to be captured. Pooh and Tigger (both voiced by the versatile Jim Cummings) along with Piglet and the others attempt to save their owner from the ""Backson"" - an ominous-sounding monster born it turns out not from the dark forest that they fear but from their comical inability to read well. As the animals scramble and stumble through the Hundred Acre Wood the film also veers off-course at times seeming to lose focus of its central story. But with chipper songs physical comedy (however much exists for animation) witty puns and a lovable goofiness packed into a tight 69 minutes it seems capable of holding childrens attention and even entertaining older viewers (many of whom likely grew up with the bear themselves). This Disney flick lacks the Pixar glitz and even depth of many popular kids movies over the last decade such as Up or the Toy Story series. But it still has a visual and emotional artistry that depicts the value of committed friendships highlighting challenges that may come along. Yet what it expresses most of all is the sheer fun and joy these experiences can bring. And that of course is the real jar of honey.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + If youre a glass-half-empty type you look at Disneys recurring attempts to tweak Winnie the Poohs relevance - and profitability - and heave a sigh. There seems to be a ""hey whatever works disregard about say selling 2000s ""The Tigger Movie by sampling the boppy ""Semi-Charmed Life - a crystal meth tune - for the trailer. The more recent Disney Channel series ""My Friends Tigger amp; Pooh eschewed the characters timelessly quaint hand-drawn aesthetic in favor of shiny computer-animated dimensionality and ditched Christopher Robin for a contemporary all-American tomboy. (Kay Hanley handled the innocently bubbly theme for that one so no worries there.)If youre more inclined to view the honey pot as half full you can feel good knowing that despite such corporate-minded willy-nilly silliness A.A. Milnes world always seems to retain its charm. The ""Tigger amp; Pooh show ultimately was fun and this weeks new movie revival simply titled ""Winnie the Pooh is sweetly agreeably traditional. The film is directed by Stephen J. Anderson and Don Hall whose calling card was the serviceable tomorrowland toon ""Meet the Robinsons and boasts an appealing mix of returning and modestly gimmicky voice talent. Series vet Jim Cummings reprises both Pooh and Tigger Craig Ferguson is Owl Tom ""SpongeBob Kenny is Rabbit and John Cleese is the narrator while Zooey Deschanel shows off her singing on a couple of generically pleasant soundtrack ditties.As for what kids care about - the story - this incarnation finds the gang getting into familiar misadventures to the point that it sometimes feels like the filmmakers are playing it too safe. Pooh is on the hunt for honey since hes all out. Eeyore has lost his tail so theyre hunting for that too. But a pin gets put in all of it when they misread a ""back soon note from Christopher Robin and comically convince themselves that a big bad monster called the Backson is stalking the Hundred Acre Wood.The animators get engagingly inventive with some of the resultant scurrying about using text from the storybook pages displayed onscreen as active props that bonk characters on the head pile up into a handy ladder etc. And there are laughs for everyone in an extended sequence in which Pooh and friends get stuck - no real spoiler here - in a pit theyve dug for the Backson. Poor Piglet - viewers his size will break up at his anxiety-hindered attempts to save the day. Eeyore meanwhile flashes one of the movies occasional bits of unobtrusive sharpness glumly lamenting ""Were all gonna die. Where was he to give Hurley some comic relief backup on ""Lost? And where was more of this in the ""Pooh script?The movie clocks in at just over an hour - awfully fleeting at multiplex prices.

Pooh gets stung by a radioactive bee transforms into a superpowered grizzly and wreaks havoc but not before both Roo and Piglet become dinner. Okay not really. In Disneys warm bath of a film theres nothing even as potentially upsetting as shampoo-froth horns. The yellow bears motivation couldnt be more sweet Pooh craves Hunny. Unlike most new kids films which pack in adult references new settings and new characters the new Pooh is very much the old Pooh. Clocking in at barely more than an hour and never leaving the Hundred Acre Wood this wisp of a story stitches together a few familiar story lines involving Christopher Robins brief absence Eeyores debilitating but unpathologized depression and Poohs adorable appetite. Rabbit nudges Owl pontificates Tigger pounces Piglet scurries. Thats about it. The hand-drawn animation is old-school clean and spare (question for Etsy shoppers does that make it artisanal?) Pooh Piglet and friends all look exactly as you remember them. Zooey Deschanel lilts a few lullabies. The films only distinct visual signature is some delightful playfulness with typography. As if crawling through the pages of a book Pooh scrambles atop one letter swings from another and crashes down in a messy alphabetic pile. Some films seem like they were made for DVD; this may be the first that seems like it was fashioned for the iPad. With its abbreviated run time and anodyne plot this slight tale is geared toward very young children and doesnt have much to offer if youre older than say 6 -- but the film isnt irritating either. And as a parent its something of a relief that its so much like what we thought childrens entertainment was supposed to be like. Instead of cringing at every dumb poop joke overreaching meta-reference or annoying bit of product placement parents will likely find the film adorably if forgettably soothing. After a summerlong rampage of Hollywoods obnoxious misbehavior Pooh is mercifully without sting.

Milne book about the hungry bear and his adventurous friends. Winnie the Pooh Good Directors Stephen J. Anderson Don Hall. Cast Jim Cummings Craig Ferguson John Cleese. Rating G. This weeks new movie releases Disney/Pixar movies But Im awfully glad Disney did. Sweet gentle and defiantly retro (the 2-D hand-drawn animation is superb) the movie is irresistibly charming. Its also short clocking in at a little more than an hour which makes it seem a little like an episode of a TV show - a really good episode of a TV show. The action takes place as it must in the Hundred Acre Wood where Pooh lives with his friends Tigger Eeyore Rabbit Owl Piglet Kanga and Roo. They are the stuffed animals of human boy Christopher Robin come to life; Christopher interacts with them as friends and vice versa. Pooh (voice of Jim Cummings who also provides the voice of Tigger) is on a constant quest for honey his chubby little tummy constantly growling. But on this particular day he has a Very Important Thing to Do. Just what that thing is narrator John Cleese wont tell him - it would spoil the story he explains. But adventures abound. The first pressing issue is finding the lost tail of sad-sack Eeyore (Bud Lackey) who accepts this as just another vicissitude of life. But finding it is easier said than done. Intellectual snob Owl (Craig Ferguson) typically overthinks everything; high-strung Rabbit (Tom Kenny) is all over the place; bouncy Tigger is no more focused. Then the gang misreads a note left by Christopher (Jack Boulter) who has headed off for school. Back soon he says and before you know it Owl has deduced that the boy has been kidnapped by a creature called the Backson. So they also set off to free Christopher from Backsons clutches. Its clear early that any success the well-meaning but hapless friends may have is going to have to be accidental. But thats OK. The fun is in the trying. Pooh refers to himself as ""a bear of very little brain and long words bother me."" But words though maybe not particularly long ones carry the story - literal words words that Milne wrote which interject themselves into the story time and again. Its an interesting choice by directors Stephen J. Anderson and Don Hall and it works. Most everything in ""Winnie the Pooh"" does. Too slight to quite become a Very Important Thing to Do it is nevertheless a Very Fun One.

Share Tweet Childrens films these days generally tend to feel like dry runs for their inevitable video-game adaptations especially 3-D kid flicks that are all about shiny things going zoom. So its refreshing to watch a childrens film that moseys along placidly to the soothing rhythms of a beautifully illustrated childrens book rather than attempting to mimic the deafening volume and speed of most childrens entertainment. Disneys lovely John Cleese-narrated new adaptation of Winnie The Pooh represents an unusually pure literary adaptation and not just because words have such a physical presence in the film that they literally help the characters out of a bind. Winnie The Pooh is a bibliophile kids film that assumes to its credit that children love words and books and the characters contained within them just as much as it does. Winnie The Poohs wafer-thin plot finds its fluff-stuffed bear in a state of mild panic after running out of honey. He soon has more to worry about when he encounters a troublesome note from his friend Christopher Robin explaining that hes busy but will be ""back soon."" Poohs pompous pal Owl misinterprets the missive as a dire warning about a sinister creature known as the ""BackSon"" that will destroy everything in its path if they let it. Meanwhile Eeyore has lost his tail rendering him even more despondent and bereft of hope than usual. Winnie the Pooh is distinguished by elegant simplicity. Directors Don Hall and Stephen Anderson reproduce both the gorgeous minimalism of the books theyre adapting and their tone of bittersweet whimsy edging unmistakably into melancholy at least where the eternally tragicomic presence of Eeyore is concerned. In the films funniest sequence the manic Tigger tries to reinvent the depressive Eeyore in his own ebullient image with predictably unsuccessful results. Winnie The Pooh is a storybook brought to life with intelligence wit and palpable affection; where so many kids films try desperately to come off as hip and timely that they often feel tacky and instantly dated Winnie The Pooh is bravely quiet old-fashioned and wry. The same is true of ""The Ballad Of Nessie"" a lovely short film about the loneliness of the Loch Ness monsters and the healthiness of tears which just barely stretches Winnie The Pooh past the hour mark.

Anderson; Author Stephen J. Anderson; Release Date Wide 07/15/2011; Runtime (in minutes) 68; MPAA Rating G Posted July 13 2011 -- 1200 AM EDT It sounded like a charming idea a return not merely to drawn animation but to the playful simplicity of Disneys 1960s Winnie the Pooh cartoons. In execution it is charming...and also a little monotonous. The animators tap our nostalgia for Pooh -- the Charlie Brown of honey drippers -- and for the gently homogenized whimsical flavor that was A.A. Milne gone Magic Kingdom. But these cutely interlocked daydream tales (of Eeyore losing his tail of Poohs endless quest for that golden syrupy nectar) end up floating a bit too weightlessly through the air. B?

Milnes talking teddy bear Disneys frickin adorable return to the Hundred Acre Wood is a wonderfully faithful throwback to the 60s animated features (and the original Ernest H. Shepard book illustrations that inspired the studios watercolored 2-D look) with a modest veneer of postmodern cleverness. Occasionally breaking down the fourth wall John Cleese narrates the storybook day-in-the-life of honey junkie Pooh and his cheerfully naive neurotic woodland pals--obsessive-compulsive neat freak Rabbit know-it-all narcissist Owl co-dependent Kanga and Roo anxiety-prone Piglet and ADHD-addled Tigger--as they compete to find a new donkey tail to pin on to the eternally depressed Eeyore. Theres little more to the premise than that plus a few tangential distractions most winsome a sequence in which the gang irrationally fears and prepares to trap an imaginary horned beast called ""The Backson."" At barely over an hour the film still overflows with musical charm nostalgic wonder and visual wit (characters literally interact with the words on Milnes pages).

While the animation is similar the story is more closely based on Milnes deftly written comedy episodes. And so Pooh begins his adventures by searching for donkey Eeyores lost tail along with his usual elusive dose of hunny (this guy is some addict). Milnes words appear on screen and interact with the characters at one point they use the letters to form a ladder. Its more literary than recent versions such as 2005s Poohs Heffalump Movie and brings an old-fashioned charm back to the series.Misunderstandings over words abound one amusing adventure involves a note Christopher Robin has left for his toys saying hell be Back soon. Under the misguidance of puffed-up pseudo-intellectual Owl the gang is soon on the hunt for the terrifying Backsun a creature that has captured Christopher. Musical numbers are mostly trite although Zooey Deschanels quirky-cutesy voice suits the theme tune well. John Cleese narrates while many voices return from the Disney TV shows and movies including Jim Cummings as Pooh. New on the block is a barely recognisable Craig Ferguson as Owl and Bud Luckey (Chuckles in Toy Story 3) who brings his growl to Eeyore. Plot-wise its nothing special the film is a couple of stories woven into one and cant hold a candle to the likes of Toy Story. This is a relatively modest film but one that should entertain the very young - along with nostalgic parents and grandparents.

Disney has done plenty right by the Hundred Acre Wood gang in its latest bigscreen outing preserving the traditional hand-drawn appearance and gently whimsical storytelling of the A.A. Milne-based series in an era of CG-animated 3D-accentuated excess. Yet while it will do its part to cultivate a new generation of fans this soothingly short 69-minute picture boasts a few touches that if not exactly crass have been applied with perhaps too knowing a wink resulting in a slightly condescending aftertaste. Moppets of course wont mind and parents will prove similarly indulgent spelling another lucrative homevid Pooh-rennial following strong theatrical play. Bowing Wednesday in Europe in advance of its July 15 Stateside opening this is the first Disney toon to be released under the simple title of ""Winnie the Pooh"" which may prime family audiences to expect a new classic or at least a more involving adventure than they may have gotten out of ""Poohs Heffalump Movie."" Unlike the trio of excellent standalone shorts that made up 1977s ""Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" still the best introduction to the series the story here (credited to eight writers) weaves three Milne-inspired tales into one pleasant if undistinguished yarn replete with lessons in friendship teamwork and the importance of putting others needs first. After a new version of the Sherman Bros. title tune sung by Zooey Deschanel the story begins as usual with Pooh awakening to a new day and an empty stomach. Setting out to rectify this sad if perpetual state of affairs the bear of very little brain but considerable heart stumbles upon Eeyore looking even glummer than usual after having misplaced his tail. Naturally Pooh Tigger Rabbit Piglet Owl Kanga and Roo come to the rescue initiating a contest to see who can find the morose donkey a new rear appendage -- the prize for which somewhat improbably if temptingly for Pooh is a fresh pot of honey. But the matter of Eeyores tail is momentarily forgotten once Pooh and his friends misled by Owls iffy reading-comprehension skills come to believe Christopher Robin has been abducted by the Backson an ugly ill-mannered monster that looms ever more fearsomely in their imaginations in ""The Backson Song"" (the most memorable of the original tunes penned by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez). Performed over an inventive montage of quick-moving chalkboard drawings this interlude is one of two musical sequences conceived and animated in a bolder more fanciful style the other being ""Everything Is Honey"" in which Pooh finds himself in a golden-hued wonderland where everything is made of something sweet. Elsewhere directors Stephen Anderson (""Meet the Robinsons"") and Don Hall stick to a visual palette that under Paul Felixs art direction retains the two-dimensional watercolor-based style of the classic Pooh adventures albeit polished to a high-tech gloss that in no way compromises its retro charm. The desire to stay true to what was lovable and enduring about the originals is palpable throughout down to the amusing storybook conceit of having the characters interact not only with the narrator (voiced by John Cleese) but also with the letters and punctuation marks on the page. Given the obvious and affectionate care taken in all departments the unwelcome tone the film occasionally adopts toward some of its characters is all the more surprising. While the denizens of the Hundred Acre Wood have always been endearing in their gullibility there are instances here when the story seems to take too much pleasure in their lack of sophistication exaggerating certain character traits for laughs of a crueler-than-usual variety. Piglet may be a worrywart but hes not the hapless incompetent hes made out to be in one of a handful of scenes that momentarily spoil the mood of earnest sincerity so clearly being aimed for. Craig Fergusons turn as the plummy loquacious Owl reps the starriest addition to an expert voice cast led by Jim Cummings again doing Pooh/Tigger double duty as he has on the past several features TV series and videogames derived from this ever-profitable property.

Milnes characters while parents will be thankful for the thoughtfully brief running time. TWITTER Preschoolers will enjoy the animated feature featuring the voices of Jim Cummings Craig Ferguson John Cleese and Tom Kenny and songs sung by Zooey Deschanel while parents will appreciate the 69-minute running time writes Todd McCarthy. Disney refurbishes a franchise thats been one of its reliable little goldmines for half a century with Winnie the Pooh. A seamless narrative rather than a collection of segments in the manner of The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh in 1977 this gentle lovingly wrought for-tots-and-parents-only resuscitation of A.A. Milnes characters may have unintentionally set a Hollywood record of sorts Its 69 minutes long including 10 devoted to the credits meaning that 14.5 per cent of the running time details who worked on the film including production babies (arguable feature length for the program is reached by tacking on a six-minute opening cartoon The Ballad of Nessie about the Loch Ness monsters self-created lake of tears). Whether or not Disney Animation always intended that the feature proper would come at under an hour the film will be a first weekend matinee choice for more than a few preschooler families (theres no weeknight audience for it) before becoming a staple homevid and TV title. The defiantly low-tech offering bows in France on April 13 in the U.K. and Germany the next day and in seven other territories in advance of the July 15 U.S. launch. So definitive are the soft simple pastel evocations of the English countryside in E.H. Shepards original Pooh illustrations that revisionist versions would be unthinkable. Directors Stephen J. Anderson and Don Hall (director and a writer respectively on Meet the Robinsons) do nothing to rock the boat delivering rich beautifully rendered visual backdrops for the mild antics of the familiar characters. And familiar they are for anyone whos been on the planet for more than four or five years. On renewed acquaintance Poohs obsessive search for bottomless amounts of honey and Eeyores distress over having lost his tail possess limited resonance as do the repetitive cutesy misspellings that dot the landscape. Unlike some other characters from childrens literature and cartoons Milnes sweet and docile creations seem like little more than stuffed animals given voice and of genuine appeal only to humans still attached to the likes of teddy bears and other cuddly sleepytime companions. The music too represents a throwback both the new compositions and the retreads of Sherman Brothers tunes here dressed up with new vocals by Zooey Deschanel.
