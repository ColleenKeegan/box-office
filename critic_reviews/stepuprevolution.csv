(AP Photo/Summit Entertainment Sam Emerson) Sam Emerson This film image released by Summit Entertainment shows a scene from ""Step Up Revolution."" (AP Photo/Summit Entertainment Sam Emerson) Summit Entertainment Ryan Guzman and Kathryn McCormick in ""Step Up Revolution."" ""Step Up Revolution"" taps into the dance ""flash mob"" phenomenon and moves to Miami to give us the sunniest and most entertaining of these kids-gotta-dance musicals.The flash mobs -- in traffic dancing on the roofs hoods and trunks of low-rider vintage cars in Miami traffic disrupting museum openings and a developers planning meetings -- are a brilliantly choreographed well-shot and sharply edited treat.Well except for one unfortunately timed stunt involving a darkened room smoke bombs and menacing dancers charging in wearing gas masks. And another with dancers imitating machine guns strafing a crowd. Sad that the news intrudes inadvertently on this late summer cotton-candy treat. Sean (Ryan Guzman) is the heart and soul of ""The Mob"" a Miami dance crew that has its own DJ (Cleopatra Coleman) hacker-planner (Misha Hamilton) dancer/special effects guy (Stephen Boss) and street artist who ""tags"" each of their events with ""The Mob"" (Michael Langebeck). Thats not to mention their parkour ""stunt"" specialists and the videographer who hides his camera in the darnedest places whenever they go out on ""a mission.""Stopping traffic and choreographing the jolly bouncing low-riders they roll up in has got to be preserved and uploaded to YouTube. They want to attract so many YouTube hits that they win a contest and collect some cash. Because these dancers are from the one underdeveloped corner of Miami riverfront left -- and the wrong side of the tracks.Sean and Eddy (Hamilton) work in a swank hotel whose developer/owner (Peter Gallagher) has designs on the neighborhood the dancers call home. But his daughter Emily (Kathryn McCormick) is a dancer too. And being as attractive as Sean and his beyond-good-looking crew shes ready to add to her modern-dance repertoire and go undercover for a little dance on the wild side.Emily needs to free herself to have a shot at breaking into a daring local professional dance troupe. Sean needs cash and to be noticed to have ""a voice."" And the crew will need help from kids from the earlier ""Step Up"" movies (this is the fourth) to pull off their biggest mission. Director Scott Speer from ""The Legion of Extraordinary Dancers"" knows where to point his camera knows how to cut to the beat. Everything from parkour-style stunts and mime to salsa crunking and interpretative dance is given its showcase here. But its not just the choreography that sells this over-familiar story. Speer peoples the screen with legions of jaw-droppingly gorgeous dancers actors and extras -- shaking what theyve got in 3-D. Whatever Miami got for posing as the 1980s Sunset Strip for ""Rock of Ages"" this under-scripted super-sexy cinematic postcard is the one the tourist board should post on its website.Come to Miami. Bring your bikini.

Pavement politics prance through this latest instalment of the fleet-footed dim-witted dance franchise for some reason not called Step Up 4 Ur Rightz. This one introduces a fresh batch of attractively inexpressive urban toe-tappers here under threat from Peter Gallaghers oily property magnate. Naturally the way to save their working-class seafront community is to stage a series of elaborate pop-up dance routines in a range of moneyed hangouts with the secret assistance of the tycoons dance-crazy daughter (pro hoofer Kathryn McCormick) before selling out at the first sniff of corporate sponsorship. Its equal parts Flashdance Burlesque and Lambada all parts ludicrous - but we arent here for the story any more than we watch Bela Tarr for the salsa numbers. Abetted by in-your-face 3D the dancing is astonishing as the dancers ditch the usual bump-and-grind for unexpectedly conceptual choreography peaking with an ingenious camouflage routine in a modern art gallery that Pina Bausch might have conceived after a few pina coladas.

Theres too much color and energy and frenzy in this movie to discount it entirely but it has a disconcerting tendency to undercut its best notions with some singularly awful moves. Some of these flaws pop up in the script -- never the strong suit of the ""Step Up"" franchise of which this is the fourth -- but others have to do with where these movies excel which is in the presentation of impossibly beautiful young dancers executing eye-popping elaborately choreographed hip-hop moves set to an endless wall of fat beats. This time out were in Miami where the hotel that employs waiter Sean (Ryan Guzman) has just been taken over by real-estate magnate Anderson (Peter Gallagher) whose plans for expansion include tearing down a stretch of riverfront property where Sean and his friends live and where they dance the night away in a funky little Cuban nightclub. Also read Summit Opts to Keep Gas-Mask Scene in Step Up Revolution When theyre not slinging ceviche Sean and his best pal Eddy (Misha Gabriel) organize a group called the Mob staging complex dance numbers in the middle of Miami in the hopes of becoming YouTube sensations. When their neighborhood is in danger of demolition at Andersons hands the Mob turns its efforts to public protest inspired by their newest member Emily (Kathryn McCormick). Thing is Emily is Andersons daughter but only her boyfriend Sean knows it. So yes -- second verse same as the first. In the 1940s Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland put on a show to save the orphanage and the old folks home in the 1980s Boogaloo Shrimp and Shabba-Doo popped and locked to keep the community center from being knocked down and now the big bad forces of real estate are once again going to be danced into submission. Thats all well and good but screenwriter Jenny Mayer throws in two lines of dialogue at the very end that completely upend The Mobs progressive and populist intentions in a way that all the ""Fight the Power"" tank tops in the world cant correct. Still were here for the dancing and much of it is truly jaw-dropping from the opening sequence involving hydraulically-enhanced muscle cars in every color of the rainbow to an art gallery exhibition coming to life to the big finale that throws everything from parkour to Busby Berkley-style spectacle at the wall. (Explanations for how these blue-collar flash-mobbers can afford all the electronics automobiles and costumes required for their displays falls in the ""relax its a musical"" category.) Also read Step Up Red May Be Turned into TV Shows Lionsgate Says The players dont register much as actors -- although Eddys obvious resentment over Emilys intrusion into his relationship with Sean provides a hilarious ""Ben Hur""-esque undercurrent of sublimated sexuality -- but they dance like nobodys business. Director Scott Speer doesnt make the usual mistake of contemporary dance movies (the movements arent shredded into a fine slaw in the editing room) but he creates a new one of his own Theres so much speeding up and slowing down of the dancers in post-production that were still distracted from their actual dancing. Its the sort of gimmickry thats catchy in a soda commercial but theres barely a moment in the movie when people leap or dance or slide without some kind of enhanced trickery. (The 3D its worth noting works much better here than in the previous ""Step Up"" movie where it felt tacked-on. Here at least they seem to have shot with the third dimension in mind. Its no ""Pina"" but its a step up if you will.) While the movies big moments are still breathtaking you begin to appreciate the smaller pleasures of Sean and Emily doing a provocative Salsa just because its one of the few moments that no one felt like jacking up in the editing suite. In the current movie marketplace the real revolution will happen when directors will trust the simple and powerful appeal of dancers just dancing. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Now we find ourselves transplanted to Miami for the otherwise identical ""Step Up Revolution"" in which a flash mob (known simply as ""The Mob"") has been pulling off elaborate dance stunts in public view for the sake of earning a 100000 prize on YouTube. The stakes are raised once real estate magnate Bill Anderson (Peter Gallagher phoning it in) comes to South Beach with daughter Emily (Kathryn McCormick) in tow. Shes a classical dancer with an elite company in her sights despite Daddys assurances that her dream is hopeless. Mob leader Sean (Ryan Guzman) is a waiter in Andersons employ who catches Emilys eye and while they start to swoon for one another neither realizes that Papa Anderson is set on bulldozing the Mobs neighborhood for the sake of a few more high-rises. Will Sean give Emilys dance routine the extra kick that it needs? Will Emily tell her dad that shes taken up with the Mob out of protest? Will Sean reveal Emilys true identity to his best friend (Misha Gabriel)? Will the mute graffiti artist on their team ever utter a word? Can they save the salsa club??? Its all as predictable and corny as it sounds livened up only by the dance sequences just as a hokey slasher film might boast some juicy kills. ""Revolution"" finds itself relentlessly beholden to formula and with the most wooden leads of the series to date -- an MMA fighter and a ""So You Think You Can Dance"" alum -- the drama between the dancing has never felt more interminable. The plot as it were is only tangentially tied into the earlier films with series favorite Moose (Adam Sevani) showing up for about as long as Tatum himself did at the start of ""SU2."" Local news segments and buzz talk of the Mobs videos going viral are laughably rabid and when walking behind a restaurant surrounded by crab traps our Cleveland princess earnestly proclaims ""People actually live here"" Even for films that have never been concerned with gritty reality the corporate-sanctioned anarchy of this entry seems especially naive with money literally being thrown at the audience in 3-D just as much as sand sun and sparks are. The Mobs grand displays are indeed the highlights a blend of hip-hop parkour acrobatics and performance art often set to the epileptic stylings of dubstep. New to the series but not to dance director Scott Speer generally knows better than to get in the way of the choreography although the somewhat hectic editing of these scenes keeps them from matching the more generous approach of previous helmer Jon M. Chu. A corporate lockstep number stands high above the rest while other sequences see the Mob presuming to improve on the curated art of Miamis stuffy museums and striving to earn those all-precious hits online. Is it all worth sitting through some awfully laughable melodrama and a happy ending that defines hypocrisy? For fans of the franchise ""Step Up Revolution"" reliably delivers vaguely sultry romance and no shortage of flashy moves but for everyone else its pretty much the same old song and dance.

""Step Up Familiar Ground"" or ""Step Up Youve Seen All This Before"" would be more accurate but Summit Entertainments marketing department knows that wouldnt help sell tickets. By proudly waving its dance-to-live flag ""Step Up"" actually falls in lockstep with a proud lineage of body-rocking dramas. The toned specimens bending and kicking through ""Revolution"" love talking about ""breaking the rules"" when it comes to their attention-grabbing choreography. At the same time the film desperately clings to exactly the same rigid rage-against-the-machine screenwriting tropes that defined its various predecessors. The four ""Step Up"" films couldnt exist without ""You Got Served"" ""Dirty Dancing"" ""Footloose"" (the original and its remake) ""Breakin 2 Electric Boogaloo"" ""Flashdance"" ""Saturday Night Fever"" and yes even ""West Side Story."" Director Scott Speer transports audiences to Miami where poor but virtuous dancers Sean (Ryan Guzman) and Eddy (Misha Gabriel) strategically plan flash mobs around South Beachs stylish neighborhoods. They dance to express themselves . . . but also to get their video clips on YouTube where theyre racing other Internet sensations in a contest that awards 100000 to the first video to amass 10 million hits. In our Internet age exposures almost as valuable as actual cash. Sean eventually gets distracted though when he instantly falls for Emily (Kathryn McCormick). A skilled ballerina with a taste for bad boys Emily also happens to be the rich daughter of a greedy real-estate entrepreneur (a typecast Peter Gallagher) who plans to bulldoze Sean and Eddys neighborhood to make room for a sleek hotel and business park. Boy I sure hope these dance-crazy kids can figure out some way to raise enough money and/or awareness to prevent the evil tycoon from decimating a chunk of Miamis thriving cultural community. The overused chase-your-dreams clich propping up ""Step Up Revolution"" almost shaves the edges off the films electric choreography but the young and nimble cast eventually powers through the obvious screenwriting with a combustible jolt of sweat sand energy heart and suggestive choreography. The ""Revolution"" dance sequences are exquisite with the film easily dividing into a series of memorable music videos staged in recognizable Miami locales. So long as ""Step Up"" keeps dancing its possible to forgive its flaws. Too bad the insufficient character work bridging the dance scenes routinely drags ""Revolution"" back down to Earth. Guzman McCormick and their attractive castmates clearly were hired for their dance skills not their nonexistent acting chops. Its worth noting that ""Revolution"" is available in 3-D where Speers candy-coated South Florida cinematography pops off the screen and dancers limbs extend into the audience as the cast bends and contorts at impossible angles. But my eye continually wandered to the palm trees aqua-blue pool water sandy beach and bikini-clad bodies that beckoned from the ""Revolution"" screen. Considering the clichd storyline and lackluster acting maybe its South Beach that deserves top billing on the ""Revolution"" poster. At the very least the Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau owes Speer and his producers a fruit basket in exchange for all of this free advertising.Contains some suggestive dancing and language.

While there are some good ideas in the story the non-dance scenes overall are weakly executed ridden with dialogue cliches absent of spark or tension and featuring mostly lacklustre acting; there is no Channing Tatum (star of the original Step Up) to be discovered here. Movies Step Up Revolution The official trailer And there is only one street-dance crew in this Miami-set movie. A flash mob of hot dancers parkour artists an edgy filmmaker an internet-savvy strategist a female DJ and a graffiti guy who have creatively dubbed themselves The Mob storm public spaces to put on elaborate displays record them then put them up on YouTube for fun and hopefully profit.You see theres this online contest and the first dance crew to reach a million hits for their YouTube video wins 100000 - which seems to be the approximate budget for The Mobs ambitious acts of performance-art stealth. Somebody in the crew has gotta be out of pocket here people.In the boisterous opening scene set up like the preparation for a heist The Mob creates gridlock in a busy thoroughfare so they can dance on top of strategically stalled low-riders which themselves pop up and down in a chorus line of metal. Later The Mob infiltrates a posh gathering at a modern-art gallery camouflaging themselves like statues and paintings (a la that Gotye video) and integrating themselves into installations. Onlookers are consistently delighted flashing their mobile devices to capture images and help the viral spin.But when The Mob learns a recently arrived hotelier-developer (Peter Gallagher) is seeking city approval to level their favourite Cuban salsa hangout (and the surrounding working-class waterfront neighbourhood) to make room for his latest project things get political. Power to the people - through danceThe Mobs conspicuous protest number becomes a mainstream media sensation (cue the montage scene of local news coverage CNN and talk-show beats) yet The Mobs identity still unfathomably remains a total mystery to the general public. And will their provocative political statement change anything? Maybe not because the mob is about to get angry.As usual the romantic couple complicates everything. Our hero Ricky of Cuban descent lives with his sister works as a waiter at a high-class beach hotel but is a key strategist and hoofer with The Mob. After work on a crowded sandy dancefloor he makes a few moves with Emily an aspiring modern dancer recently of Cleveland whom he has just met in a seriously lame scene at the bar. Emily is the daughter of Rickys boss - remember the developer dude mentioned earlier? You can see the conflict coming from miles away.As Ricky and Emily former MMA fighter and model Ryan Guzman and former So You Think You Can Dance? finalist Kathryn McCormick - both in their first-ever film roles - physically fit the bill. But watching their acting - like everything in Step Up Revolution that is not dancing - is a lot like having too much beach sand between your toes not painful just uncomfortable.Special to The Globe and Mail Report Typo/Error Follow us on Twitter GlobeArts Comments Print /License AA In the know Life This woman became a middle-age man magnet.

Special to Newsday + - Ryan Guzman and Kathryn McCormick star in ""Step Up Revolution."" Photo Credit Handout advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Guerrilla dance troupe creates havoc and delight in Miami. BOTTOM LINE India outsources a Bollywood musical to America. CAST Ryan Guzman Kathryn McCormick Peter Gallagher LENGTH 137 Even more than its three predecessors ""Step Up Revolution"" is the closest thing so far to an American Bollywood musical what with its class-conscious romance emotional melodrama merely serviceable story and use of big chorus numbers in natural settings rather than songs to move the plot. And while dance purists wont be impressed by the energetic and athletic choreography -- the dancers have clearly learned routines but not necessarily technique -- date-movie audiences will likely want to go out dancing afterward themselves and thats fun. In ever-photogenic Miami a band of young street dancers called The Mob stages flash-mob happenings for a YouTube competition in which the first group to get 10 million viral-video hits wins. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? The opening scene in which they tie up Ocean Drive in the Art Deco hotel district -- dancing on cars in an homage to the famous ""Fame"" scene but amped up with a background chorus of high-bouncing lowriders -- is a joyful phantasmagoria. Some stuffy types tell TV reporters these hooligans are an outrage but the onlookers are mostly all smiles applause and cellphone cameras. The Mob repeats its performance art at a restaurant a city council meeting and in the movies highlight a museum where sculptures come to life camouflaged dancers step out of painted canvasses and luminescent ballerinas form ghostly silhouettes. Of course Mob co-founder Sean (MMA fighter Ryan Guzman a natural actor) falls for Emily (""So You Think You Can Dance"" tour dancer Kathryn McCormick) daughter of real-estate mogul Bill Anderson (a sensible and sympathetic Peter Gallagher) who wants to redevelop the neighborhood where the dancers live and hang out.

That parts not very Bollywood at all. advertisement | advertise on newsday PLOT Guerrilla dance troupe creates havoc and delight in Miami.

The dialogue is ridiculous the acting wooden -- but thats not why we go is it? Ever since Jennifer Grey carried a watermelon weve had a seemingly endless appetite to see the rich girl and the poor boy tear it up on the dance floor. In ""Step Up Revolution"" the fourth installment of this popular franchise our cut-rate Johnny Castle is Sean (Ryan Guzman his massive arms confirming his background in mixed martial arts) a hotel waiter smitten with Emily (""So You Think You Can Dance"" finalist Kathryn McCormick) whose one-percenter daddy (Peter Gallagher) owns the place. They meet cute at the hotels beach nightclub where she wows him with a sand-throwing dirty dance that cant have made her all that popular with the other patrons. Sean of course isnt just a wage slave -- hes also the leader of a ragtag bunch (is there any other kind in these films?) of street dancers known for their well-orchestrated flash-mob antics around Miami. Inventively they call themselves the Mob. Incorporating this topical art form -- and its symbiotic relationship with social media -- into the plot is a smart and creative move. The Mob deploys several cool (if highly unrealistic) numbers evolving into a sort of kinetic Occupy South Beach movement. One of its best productions unfortunately hits a little too close to home right now At a high-rise gala dancers burst in wearing gas masks and wielding smoke bombs causing partygoers to shriek and run for the exits. The choreography is solid throughout but director Scott Speer gets in his own way every time relentlessly shifting camera angles to close-ups and reaction shots when he should be letting us witness the spectacle. The great thing about a flash mob is its tailor-made to be filmed by spectators; the one-shot mass effect is the whole point. The overall feel here is frenetic when what Speers going for -- and could have had with this young talented bunch -- is exuberant. (One thing Speer is clearly not concerned with is message. Hilariously the conclusion involves a monumental sellout that flies directly in the face of the Mobs whole raison detre). Off the dance floor need I tell you that Sean and Emilys relationship runs into some class-related speed bumps? Or that one of them really wants to ace an audition for the local conservatory? Theres a passably fun time to be had here if youre in the mood for 3-D eye candy and infectious tunes. But you may walk away thinking you could have made a better version with your iPhone.

Because if youre interested in Step Up Revolution (1 1/2 stars out of four) for its plot and character development youre out of luck.But thats never been much of an issue for a franchise that launched Channing Tatums career spawned three previous films and has raked in more than 400 million worldwide. Clearly Step Ups fans are there not for the dialogue but the bump and grind.STORY TV dance stars cross over to the big screenVIDEO Revolution dances on the red carpetAnd its there aplenty in Revolution a paper-thin story that plays like a music video on repeat.Sean (Ryan Guzman in a tilted-cap homage to Tatum) leads a group of Miami flash-mob dancers who adroitly call themselves The Mob. Thats about as clever as the movie gets.Guzmans crew a lithe posse that looks like it was plundered from the So You Think You Can Dance? set holds elaborately choreographed dance numbers in the hopes of winning a YouTube contest.About the movieStep Up Revolution1/2 out of fourStars Ryan Guzman Kathryn McCormick Peter Gallagher DirectorScott SpeerDistributor Summit Entertainment Rating PG-13 for some suggestive dancing and language Running time 1 hour 37 minutes Opens Friday nationwideBut like a lot of organizations struggling with monetizing the Internet The Mob faces its share of hurdles namely the evil real estate magnate Bill Anderson (Peter Gallagher) who plans to raze the Miami neighborhoods where The Mob broke in its very hip sneakers.Revolution tries a few plot moves but narratively it has two left feet. The lovely and limber Emily (Kathryn McCormick) convinces Sean that The Mob needs to get political and stand up to Mr. Anderson Emilys father.Perhaps feature-filmmaking freshman Scott Speer was looking to say something about the G8 summit or the Occupy movement.Whatever that message may be though is lost beneath thumping bass lines and grinding pelvises. Thats not a bad thing if you miss Soul Train and American Bandstand There isnt a franchise around that matches the kids moves in the Step Up series.We just need a better reason to dance along.

Alas the dancers have to stop sometimes to allow the utterly unoriginal story to be told and the romance at the center of it inspired Amanda Brody the screenwriter to produce dialogue so cheesy as to be laughable. Photo Ryan Guzman center in ""Step Up Revolution"" which has flash-mob dance scenes. Credit Sam Emerson/Summit Entertainment A streetwise guy named Sean (Ryan Guzman) meets a privileged gal named Emily (Kathryn McCormick) and a romance is kindled. So is a lazy plot the old evil-developer one Emilys father (Peter Gallagher) wants to replace Seans Miami neighborhood with a giant commercial development.But no one goes to a ""Step Up"" movie for the plot or the romance. Only the dancing matters here. Sean and his pals have a flash-mob dance thing going and Emily persuades them to use the attention their guerrilla performances receive to mobilize opposition to the development. Theres a swell number staged in an art museum and an even better one that interrupts a City Council meeting and if you view everything between the dances as (unintentional) comic relief youll be fine. Oh and fans of the franchise will get a kick out of cameos by some familiar faces.""Step Up Revolution"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

Here is the fourth installment of a series that no one exactly takes seriously with a script that was probably written in crayon and yet nobody onscreen seems willing to admit that theyre in anything less than ""West Side Story."" All the principal actors in ""Step Up Revolution"" are unknown and maybe thats the key right there Real life meets fiction. The people onscreen like the characters have a lot riding on this thing. They want you to see them and you can feel it. So theres youth there theres passion theres belief theres hope theres energy - but then just about everything else every practical tangible thing about this film is ghastly. Its the story of a handsome young man who looks a lot like Channing Tatum but isnt who lives in a working-class neighborhood in Miami and dreams of becoming a dancer. Sean (Ryan Guzman) has a plan for success. He is going to become famous by staging elaborate street performances. He and his group known as The Mob - I guess because the screenwriter didnt want to spend five minutes coming up with a better name - show up in random places stop traffic dance on peoples cars post the videos and then count all the hits they get on YouTube as though thats money in the bank. One day while he is working at his day job as a hotel waiter he meets Emily (Kathryn McCormick) who also wants to be a dancer but her multimillionaire father (Peter Gallagher slumming) doesnt support her dream. He wants her to come back to Cleveland to help him run his business. Yes this guy is running his 500 million real estate development business out of Cleveland. He can live anywhere he wants. He owns hotels all over the world and he chooses Cleveland. What does this mean? Are they trying to indicate that this guys one step away from a straitjacket or did screenwriter Jenny Mayer just throw a dart at the map? Anyway so Emily and Sean meet and within five minutes they are on the dance floor practically having sex and ... well just go ahead and write the rest of the movie in your mind. Youll come up with something close but a little better than ""Step Up Revolution"" which has a fake crisis about two-thirds in and feels stretched even at 97 minutes. The dances are long and aside from McCormick and Guzmans duets the choreography is awful - mostly staccato gestures acrobatics and men doing line dances most of it filmed in short takes and accentuated by stop-action animation to make the dancers look even more mechanical. Its all quite dumb lousy and earnest and yet not for one flicker of a second is it obnoxious. Look these people are dancing for you. Theyre trying. You dont have to love it but you can respect it.

"Review In Step Up Revolution dancing as cure-all - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesReview In Step Up Revolution dancing as cure-allIts a clash of rich and poor greedy developers and idealistic youth and of course dance styles.July 26 2012|By Mark Olsen Special to the Los Angeles Times In ""Step Up Revolution"" Ryan Guzman and Kathryn McCormicks... (Sam Emerson Summit Entertainment )""Step Up Revolution"" the fourth outing for the movie series in which young people dance through their feelings relocates to Miami and sets up a torn-from-the-headlines story of youthful protesters standing against economic injustice.Hotel waiter Sean (Ryan Guzman) is part of a group known as the Mob that stages elaborate street performances around the city. When he meets Emily (Kathryn McCormick) the aspiring dancer and daughter of the developer looking to take over his neighborhood it becomes a clash of dance styles and lifestyles.Directed by Scott Speer the film has the overly bright colors of a soft drink commercial though that may be a purposeful attempt to combat the notorious dimness of 3-D projection. Though the location-specific choreography looks like it could be impressive the films frantic cutting style makes it difficult to simply enjoy bodies moving in space.The musical selections imply there are two kinds of music the bass-y squelchy style the youth of today refer to as dubstep and the emo quiet storm slow jams for pensive moments of romance and close dancing.The film ends on a predictably triumphant note with vague platitudes of reconciliation and an offer to participate in a marketing campaign for a multinational campaign with a shaky labor-practice record.One perhaps does not expect a fully formed and cogent political platform from a ""Step Up"" film but when a movie puts ""Revolution"" in the title and engages community action and social justice directly there should be more at the end than simply selling out to the first bidder.calendarlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESPrevention Becomes 4th Revolution in PsychiatrySeptember 17 1987MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesBusinessYouthNot_live_webCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-step-up-revolution-20120727,0,4562091.story",200,stepuprevolution11,stepuprevolution,latimes

(Sam Emerson/AP) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday July 26 2012 301 PM Title Step Up Revolution Film Info With Kathryn McCormick Ryan Guzman. An aspiring dancer helps organize flash mobs. Director Scott Speer (137). PG-13 Sexuality language. Area theaters. It seems a little optimistic to use the word ""revolution"" in regards to a dance movie about flash mobs especially in the year 2012. Will the next ""Step Up"" tackle the cutting-edge trend of planking? There is not of course anything remotely radical about ""Step Up Revolution"" the fourth entry in this series. While the first ""Step Up"" at least introduced the world to Channing Tatum the subsequent sequels have existed solely for the dance scenes. The studio seems so aware of these limited requirements that they barely put any effort into the production itself. Almost everyone involved from director Scott Speer to writer Amanda Brody is a novice and it shows. Lead Kathryn McCormick whose biggest credit is appearing on ""So You Think You Can Dance"" has virtually no acting experience. So really she can hardly be blamed for her inability to carry an entire film. McCormick wanly plays Emily Anderson an aspiring dancer in Miami. In classic -- or just lazy -- tradition Emilys artistic dreams put her in direct conflict with her businessman father (Peter Gallagher who can surely find better ways to earn a paycheck). While working at Dads new hotel Emily falls for Sean (model Ryan Guzman also making his debut). Sean pays the bills as a waiter but his real passion is organizing extravagant flash mobs. When her father tries to bulldoze Seans working-class neighborhood Emily plans a ""protest mob"" that has long-reaching consequences for everyone. Anyway. Heres what matters The dance scenes are great. While no more revolutionary than the ""political"" plotline the flash-mob concept does allow for more creative choreography than this series has seen in some time. Speer doesnt construct much of a movie but its clear hes put his all into organizing and shooting the often dazzling set pieces. Its too bad the rest of the projects aspirations are so low though. Surely the budget could have allowed for a few more experienced actors and a well-written script. At any rate skip the unnecessary 3D ticket It just makes the movie more expensive and harder to watch. And if the producers wont expend any extra money or effort on their franchise why should you?

"Step Up Revolution (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Step Up Revolution (PG-13) Miami takes center stage in the fourth installment of the popular dance franchise. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle cogleMiamiHerald.com7/26/2012 Editor rating 2.5 In Step Up Revolution director Scott Speer uses dance as an allegory of the struggle to transcend the hopelessness of mankinds existence. Ha ha Just kidding. Its really just a dance movie interrupted sporadically for PG-13 romance bad acting ridiculous dialogue (""Im your boss not your homie"") and earnest ""lets put on a show to save our homes"" spirit. Contrary to its message it will not change the world. But the dancing will make you sit up and take notice. Filmed in Miami and Miami Beach and showing off both cities so gorgeously youll want to vacation here even if already live here Revolution is the fourth film in the series that started back when Channing Tatum played Tyler Gage a rebellious street dancer sentenced to community service who falls for a ballet dancer at a performing arts school in Baltimore. Tatum has moved on to greater and more scantily clad roles now but the Step Up train rolls ever onward buoyed by upbeat soundtracks killer choreography and the fact that this sort of street dancing looks great in 3D. Plot and performance are irrelevant. What matters are the moves and Step Up Revolution has more than enough to keep even the most casual fan appreciating the beats. Like Tyler Gage the not-really-very-bad boy of the movie Sean (Ryan Guzman) isnt much of a rebel. He even has a day job as a waiter at a swank South Beach hotel which is where he meets Emily (Kathryn McCormick) daughter of the hotels owner and developer (Peter Gallagher). But Sean also has dreams namely staging a flash mob event with his crew that is so awesome it gets the most hits on YouTube (the movies joke about the difficulty of dethroning a singing kitten video is actually a pretty good one). Seans sister wants him to apply to a management training program but Sean stands firm and you know to take him seriously because hes rocking an old-school Florida Marlins baseball cap. Emily too has aspirations; she wants to audition with a local dance company. Dad wants her to move home to Cleveland with him because as we all know the fashionable and the wealthy just cant get enough of the Rust Belt. Dad reluctantly agrees to let her try out though and soon Emily in addition to practicing her ballet is pulling off astounding feats with the rest of Seans Mob a group of dancers so mercurial they can easily evade police pursuit on Ocean Drive or in downtown Miami where streets are not usually swiftly navigated. In fact the Ocean Drive sequence that opens the movie looks like a lot of fun even though I know in my heart if I were one of the drivers stuck in the traffic while all these idiot kids and their bouncing cars blocked my access to the causeway Id be ready to step up and start a revolution all right. Trouble comes when Emilys dad decides to redevelop Seans neighborhood and throw out all the hard-working locals to provide retail space for the rich who clearly wont mind the things that wash up out of the Miami River from time to time. Then Emily comes between Sean and his best friend and not even an inspiring ""Its not OK to make art for fun anymore"" speech can smooth things over. Must be time to dance. Theres fun to be had spotting local landmarks like the parking lot/event space on Lincoln Road or the wall at the New World Symphony although locals will have to shake off the geographical inconsistencies of Seans neighborhood which appears to be simultaneously on the Miami River and right next to the AmericanAirlines Arena. And perhaps we should reassure outsiders that as Miamians we dont spend a lot of time hanging out under highway overpasses all that much here unless were sex offenders or filming a Dr Pepper commercial with Pitbull. Then again we dont dance this much in public either. Step Up Revolution definitely makes you think life would be more fun if we did. Cast Kathryn McCormick Ryan Guzman Cleopatra Coleman Peter Gallagher. Director Scott Speer. Screenwriters Duane Adler Jenny Mayer. Producers Erik Feig Jennifer Gibgot Adam Shankman Patrick Wachsberger. A Summit Entertainment release. Running time 97 minutes. Suggestive dancing language. Opens Friday July 27 at  area theaters.

The popping-and-locking heroes of this fourth Step Up movie speak truth to power the only way they know how by busting hot dance moves in the face of stuffy old white guys. A troupe of guerrilla performers led by hunky Ryan Guzman stage synchronized routines on Miamis escalators and restaurant tables; they gain righteous discontent from a classically trained ringer (Kathyrn McCormick) rallying the troops to take on her condo-building real-estate-mogul father (Peter Gallagher). The plot is pure boilerplate yet the draw of this franchise has always been its fancy footwork and the movies stuttering herky-jerky spectacles of impassioned movement are pretty extraordinary.

""Step Up Revolution"" enhanced by 3-D and set in glitzy Miami is not as cringe-worthy as you would expect from the fourth ""Step Up"" installment. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Like all previous ""Step Up"" movies the latest sequel has a love story between two dancers who come from different backgrounds and are not meant to be together -- at least not according to some people. Sean (Ryan Guzman) a hot waiter at a luxury hotel meets Emily (Kathryn McCormick) while breaking loose at a beach bar tailor-made for a senior spring-break scene. When waiting tables Sean discovers that Emily is the daughter of his employer developer Bill Anderson (Peter Gallagher). Bill wants his daughter to help run his business but Emily has her eyes set on joining an elite dance company run by a character played by Mia Michaels real-life choreographer and ""So You Think You Can Dance"" judge. Directed by Scott Speer and written by Jenny Mayer both new to the franchise ""Step Up Revolution"" doesnt repeat the standard plot device of street crews battling in over-the-top dance showdowns. Instead the dancers who call themselves ""The Mob"" make flash-mob appearances in the street at an art museum and at a fancy restaurant in an attempt to win a YouTube competition offering prize money. (It wouldnt be a ""Step Up"" movie without some kind of contest.) Sean the groups leader orchestrates unrealistic flash-mob routines featuring perfect precision and special effects that help the dancers move in ways not humanly possible but watching makes you wish you could join them for a number anyway. Emily also wants in after witnessing The Mob pop out of artwork and transform into sculptures at a museum but Sean only agrees to give her a shot if she keeps her identity a secret. Theres an inevitable big-bad-developer element that kicks in when Anderson buys land in Seans community to make way for luxury hotels. The evil mogul vs. innocent community story line has been done many times over but not with flash mobs as a form of protest. Former ""Step Up"" stars including ""Moose"" (Adam G. Sevani) return for The Mobs last-ditch effort to save their home. I wont give away the ending but lets just say even a 6-year-old at my screening left the theater dancing.

Set in a spicy Miami and introducing a conspiracy of creatives called the Mob the films motley crew stage epic flash mobs (the dancing kind) around town. There is a DJ and there are a pair of Parkour performers a special effects whiz and a graffiti artist. And then there are Step Up Revolutions stars Sean (Ryan Guzman) a neighborhood hip-hopper and Emily (Kathryn McCormick) a Twyla Tharp wannabe and daughter of an evil real estate developer (played by Peter Gallagher). They fall in love despite living on different ends of the beach. And after a rocky start as an apprentice for Wynwood Contemporary dance (her dream job) Emily joins the groups secret operation to perform a massive synchronized dance that will prevent her father from carrying out his corporate schemes. Spoiler Gallagher sheds a few 3-D tears. This gang of highly skilled dancers (with the guidance of debut director Scott Speer) delivers a sequence of spectacular group numbers that truly pop in 3-D. The Mob brings a gallerys worth of art installations to life doing a ballet in jellyfish costumes. They gyrate on tabletops in upscale restaurants and leave behind sculptures made of cutlery. It would all be too ridiculous if it werent for the choreography on display. But when you take the 3-D glasses off and the dance numbers make way for story line Step Up Revolution is hardly revolutionary. In fact its a familiar amalgam of all of the dance movies that have come before - pushing the boundaries between tribute and parody. One dancer shouts ""Its time to go from performance art to protest art"" And so they do in the least artful way possible. But if youre into dance and dance movies this one teems with the latest trends (albeit trends that will soon turn to nostalgia). In addition to those flash-mob numbers there are YouTube viral videos and Improv Everywhere-style antics that drive this movie to its krumping pop-locking wall-jumping finale. Fans of TVs So You Think You Can Dance will take pleasure in the self-referential performances of choreographer Mia Michaels not to mention Step Up Revolutions leading lady former SYTYCD contestant McCormick. Shamelessly derivative throughout Step Up Revolution throws in a sensual dance rehearsal in the water a la Dirty Dancing and an opening sequence of souped-up race cars in Fast and Furious mode - only this time there are dancers break-dancing on top of the cars The character of Sean - his greased-up six-pack his backward hat and his dreams bigger than just dancing alone or getting a real job - cant help reminding us of Step Up alum Channing Tatum grinding away in the theater next door. Sadly somewhere between a split and a fist pump Revolution fell flat and I found myself wishing for Magic Mike in 3-D.

Add energetic choreography creative art direction and eye-popping 3-D. Now subtract interesting characters common sense and whatever impatience you have for eye-rollingly bad dialogue and acting so stiff it wouldnt even pass for a low-budget dramatic re-enactment. Step Up Revolution Bad to fair Director Scott Speer. Cast Ryan Guzman Kathryn McCormick Peter Gallagher. Rating PG-13 for some suggestive dancing and language. If youre still in the black after those calculations then you fall within the margins of the intended audience for a movie like this -- another installment of a popular dance-film franchise that showcases dance moves at the expense of most all other cinematic considerations. Everyone else is better off sticking with a ""So You Think You Can Dance"" marathon. The story doesnt much matter because youre intended to pay it as little mind as the filmmakers do. But the plot such as it is focuses on the Mob an urban-dance flash mob that wreaks choreographed havoc on high-stakes locales in the interest of self-expression. Oh and money. Theres a hefty prize in it for the Mob courtesy of a YouTube competition that doesnt make a lick of sense if they can create a video that goes viral and nets 10 million hits before the other competitors do. Someone with a liver stronger than mine could devise a drinking game around the number of times the word ""hits"" is uttered. (""Get the hits"" ""This is definitely gonna get us a lot of hits"" ""Weve got to build on our momentum and generate more hits"") Theyre 20-something kids and they sound like your grandma discovering the Internet. Sensitive Sean (Ryan Guzman) is the heart of the group and he recognizes quickly that in order to step up their game theyll need Emily (Kathryn McCormick) a dance virtuoso and Seans new squeeze. She also happens to be the daughter of greedy corporate capitalist Mr. Anderson (a slumming Peter Gallagher) who has designs to raze the Mobs low-income Miami neighborhood to build ritzy hotels. When Andersons plans are unveiled the Mob turn their craft into protest art in an effort to save their city on their way to that sweet YouTube jackpot. To the films credit it knows where its strengths lie and its scenes are heavily lopsided in favor of ambitiously staged and often visually arresting dance sequences. Does it require a heroic suspension of disbelief to buy that a ragtag team of kids who hold jobs as low-level grunts can manage to plot elaborate and expensive feats of choreography in a matter of days? Of course. But youve got to admit that the dance sequences look really really good. Still the film needs a handful of connective dramatic sequences to piece together a coherent movie and everyone muddles through the standard story cliches in a daze. Shes a rich daddys girl Hes from the wrong side of the tracks They bridge their socio-economic gap through the power of dance Rinse repeat. McCormick is particularly grating in upholding her half of the romantic duo. Sure she can dance but act? She cant even convincingly record the voice-mail prompt on her characters cell phone. But nobodys going to see this expecting Oscar-worthy performances. Either an hour and a half of pretty people gyrating in a dance films third sequel is enough for you or it isnt. And on that front it delivers. Reach the writer at barbara.vandenburgharizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8371.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Theres a certain relentless economy of irony in emotionally broad movies like Step Up Revolution the fourth entry in the Step Up franchise. In a film like this character and plot development come solely in terms of dramatic setup and payoff and every strongly emphasized fact has a purpose in the form of a big reversal If someone points out that two characters have been best friends their entire lives theyre guaranteed to have a dramatic friendship-threatening feud in the third act. When someone says no one has ever ever heard that guy over there speak a single word theyre guaranteeing hell abruptly deliver his two cents worth by the end of the movie. And when co-protagonist Ryan Guzman tells his love interest So You Think You Can Dances Kathryn McCormick that theres absolutely no chance hell be caught and arrested for the flash-mob dance stunts his crew is doing to raise their YouTube profile and win a viral-video-channel contest he means theres a 100 percent chance of exactly that happening. And yet for a movie so determined not to waste the audiences time with details unless theyll lead to the most obvious drama Step Up Revolution seems awfully determined to waste time in other ways largely by churning through dance-film plot points that were exhausted by the time of 1984s Breakin 2 Electric Boogaloo. McCormick stars as that weary cliche a classically trained sheltered dancer who needs creative inspiration to ace her big audition with a famous dance troupe. Guzman (an MMA fighter who like McCormick is making his film debut here) co-stars as that equally weary complementary cliche the boy from the wrong side of the tracks whose fresh street moves might provide that inspiration. To top it off McCormicks dad (Peter Gallagher) is yes an evil developer who wants to raze Guzmans underprivileged Miami neighborhood to put up fancy condos. Is there some way Guzman and his dancing buddies can forestall this by putting on a show? Maybe though not in the usual fashion--since they cant just earn some money and pay Gallagher off they have to take their dance to the street in the form of political protests mirroring the Occupy movement thats churning up the cultural zeitgeist but coupling it with big flashy dance displays. Those dance sequences are Step Up Revolutions major sticking point. No one goes to a dance movie for the plot but the lower the expectations drop for the story the higher they rise for the raison detre performances. And the films dance sequences are visually rich and impressive with eye-popping costuming and dynamic staging but debuting feature director Scott Speer hacks them to bits focusing so much on visual dynamism that much of the physical dynamism of young strong bodies doing amazing things is lost. Many of the high-concept flash-mob routines--a huge group number featuring black-suited faux-businessmen acting like lockstep robots an impossible but lovely art-museum invasion a joyously erotic routine set in a fancy restaurant--are beautifully conceived but too often the editing wont let the viewers take in their scope and they end too quickly possibly out of a desire to not upstage the inevitable big finale. And as is typical for Step Up movies the dance sequences keep getting sidelined to make room for broad dialogue and rote conflict Gallagher gives McCormick one summer to make it as a professional dancer or face permanent drudgery working for his Cleveland corporation. Guzmans older sister is similarly trying to force him into a boring management-training program and his best bud disapproves of McCormick which strains their longstanding bromance. And hanging over it all is a cartoony class conflict of the kind that equates financial success with heartless evil and poverty with youthful vitality and the capacity for human emotion. If no one behind the scenes cared enough about the padding around the money sequences to make it original believable or interesting why is there so much of it? Maybe its to create a market for the DVD which will make it possible to skip straight to the good stuff.

TWITTER Kathryn McCormick and Ryan Guzman co-star in the fourth outing for the fly dance franchise. With their second summertime at-bat after Rock of Ages Offspring Entertainment producers Adam Shankman and Jennifer Gibgot return to one of the things they do best - making young unknowns look like the next big thing. In its fourth installment however the Step Up franchise has traded an air of inevitability for one of predictability. While diehard fans and dance fanatics will respond in the opening frame ongoing competition from superheroes and cute cartoon characters may slow momentum in subsequent weeks. VIDEO Step Up Revolution Trailer Debuts After dancing its way across Baltimore and New York City in previous iterations Step Up moves to Miami where homeboys Sean (Ryan Guzman) and Eddy (Misha Gabriel) have been best buds since toddler-hood and now lead a local dance flash mob known as well ""The Mob"" just to keep things simple. Together with their crew including choreographers visual artists and a DJ the guys have been busting out surprise dance numbers all over Miami and shooting video to compete in a YouTube contest to win 1 million. Seans day job as a waiter at a luxury hotel helps support his dance habit and pay the rent on the house he shares with his single-mom sister (Megan Boone) and niece. When Emily Anderson (Kathryn McCormick) turns up at the hotel - owned by her father Bill (Peter Gallagher) a ruthless real-estate developer -- for a summer of bartending while preparing to audition for a coveted spot with a high-toned local dance company attraction inevitably sparks between the two. As it turns out aloof Emily needs Seans help more than she suspects. Seems that the dance company director (Mia Michaels) thinks Emily is a talented performer but wound a bit too tightly to be truly creative. So if she wants to make it onto the roster Emily is going to need some new moves which she figures Sean can help deliver once she discovers hes one of the motivators behind The Mob. After her video debut a sexy number in a crowded fancy restaurant draws millions of hits online Emilys brought on with the group as they plan their next outrageous ""mission."" However theres one major obstacle looming over the pairs romantic bliss and professional success Emilys dad is determined to build a new luxury development after razing the multiracial community where Sean lives and hangs out with other Mob members. Although Sean agrees to keep Emilys identity concealed while she rehearses and performs with his crew if word gets out his street cred will be totally shot which could complicate that business about winning the YouTube video contest. Emily has another idea though encouraging Sean and The Mob to stand up to her dads development plans with some proactive dance interventions. Much like hitmaking music producers Shankman and Gibgot have orchestrated a surprisingly winning series that takes promising filmmakers and performers and turns them into recognizable professionals like directing alum John M. Chu and former man-candy dancer Channing Tatum. Making his feature-filmmaking debut music-video and TV director Scott Speer acquits himself adequately particularly since the movie is more akin to a long-form video project. Playwright and first-time screenwriter Amanda Brody plays it safe leaving the pyrotechnics to the choreography team and sticking to the franchises proven dance-romance formula which offers few surprises but delivers effectively. The attempt to add a modicum of social relevance to an essentially carefree entertainment vehicle by staging dance protests against the resort development is pretty much a nonstarter particularly since theres no indication that The Mobs illegal assemblies are attracting the least law-enforcement attention. Abercrombie amp; Fitch model Guzman looks every bit the metrosexual romantic lead but also makes a credible partner for So You Think You Can Dance star McCormick. Fortunately neither is called upon to stretch too far in the acting department and both are able to get by with good looks and flashy moves. Supporting castmembers are adequate if not outstanding but its the choreographers led by franchise vet Jamal Sims who really put the shine on the production. Revolutions mix of choreography contrasting modern dance and street-style performance that incorporates hip-hop step acrobatic moves and Cirque du Soleil-style aerial stunts forms an energetic constantly shifting mosaic. Several major set pieces including the opening downtown Miami sequence centering around a parade of low-riders help anchor significant plot developments even if they add little narrative impetus. By now however 3D dance performances are routine for the genre and with the exception of a few notable aerial tricks Revolution doesnt offer many stylistic innovations although the soundtrack featuring performances by Far East Movement (with an assist from Justin Bieber) M.I.A.

""Step Up Revolution"" the fourth entry in the venerable dance franchise is a narrative failure but a triumph of sheer spectacle. As a story about actual human characters it comes up short and as a performance film its kinetic and acrobatic yet misses an essential element of artistry. As a 98-minute eye- and ear-candy delivery device however its an unquestionable achievement. Given that the latter element was clearly its highest priority the film ultimately registers as a success and its superlative 3D work ought to help it continue its predecessors modest (if gradually declining) winning streak. The ""Step Up"" franchise has never quite gotten over the loss of star Channing Tatum who used its first installment as a key stepping stone to his current leading-man status. In his place the filmmakers turn to former male model and MMA fighter Ryan Guzman who radiates bland charm as the oft-shirtless protag Sean. Though he stumbles through a job as a waiter at a posh Miami seaside resort Sean is preoccupied with his leadership role in a gang of flash-mob dancers -- dubbed creatively the Mob -- who crash public spaces with cleverly choreographed routines. These elaborate stunts are recorded and uploaded to YouTube where the gang hopes to win a 100000 prize for having the sites most popular channel. Standing in their way is that most formidable of viral video attractions a dubstep-loving kitten. While the troupe struggles to effectively monetize its online traffic its also faced with the more pressing specter of gentrification and predatory development. The hotel that employs Sean has just been purchased by slick resort tycoon Mr. Anderson (Peter Gallagher doing yeomans work as the only experienced thesp in the primary cast) who aims to raze and redevelop the neighborhood where most of the Mob live. Meanwhile Andersons daughter Emily (Kathryn McCormick) strikes up a relationship with Sean and joins his merry band her parentage unknown to the gang. As Anderson begins to close the deal on his new hotel the Mob turns radical incorporating some anti-establishment protests into its routines shutting down an office building with the films best choreographed dance sequence and at one point even appearing in full G8-style guerrilla garb (though the activism is compromised by a bizarre plot twist that would surely make Naomi Klein scream). Everything about the plot is absurd of course and the largely inexperienced cast cant do much to salvage some groan-worthy dialogue. But there are far worse fantastical realms to inhabit than one in which jobs money woes and prison stints are but minor inconveniences in between illicit dance parties. The crew even rehearses in a fantastically equipped riverside compound that may as well be a Neverland hideout. The good news is that the narrative elements take up no more than half the running time. Structured less like a traditional dance film than an old-school skateboarding movie ""Step Up Revolution"" contains routines that are essentially staged as heists by director Scott Speer making creative use of the existing environments; a slow-building stunt in an art gallery is particularly ingenious in this regard. On a technical level the dance scenes are impeccably assembled with cameras always placed exactly where they should be 3D quality that puts a number of bigger-budgeted pics to shame and sharply intuitive music selections. The dance routines are all solidly and enthusiastically performed with even the less experienced hoofers like Guzman showing their best sides. But the aesthetic behind the routines often feels unduly indebted to ""So You Think You Can Dance?"" from which this film takes its female lead (McCormick) a producer (Adam Shankman) several prominent supporting thesps (Stephen ""tWitch"" Boss Mia Michaels) two choreographers (Travis Wall Chuck Maldonato) and a number of supporting dancers. (If the camera seems to linger on a random passerby with unusual attention its safe to assume they once appeared on the show.) Much like the series the film is rooted in cuddly versions of various hip-hop styles with sideways nods to ballet modern jazz and Cirque-style acrobatics -- a strange melange of individually enjoyable elements that never quite meld like an ice cream sundae topped with caviar. But as wonky as the film may be its anything-goes attitude can be infectious never more so than in a climactic routine that simply throws everything against the wall not waiting around to see if it sticks.
