More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Since then of course hes made up for lost time with prestigious titles like The Insider and Ali. So when it was announced that his next film would be a feature-length Miami Vice with Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx replacing Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas as Sonny Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs some - especially those disappointed by the relatively straightforward genre trappings of his last outing - were moved to ask the question But why? They need not have worried. Miami Vice the movie bears a far stronger resemblance to Manns feature work than to the TV series. Yes Crockett and Tubbs are still a tight law-enforcement duo working the photogenically neon-lit mean streets and waterways of one of the most spectacularly designed cities on the planet; and yes their rapid-reaction antics with weaponry and vehicles are performed in (more discreetly) cool kit to the expertly edited accompaniment of music both excellent and less so (what is this thing about Lynyrd Skynyrd?). But where the series - what little I recall - was mainly about style the film in both narrative and thematic terms is properly substantial.First encountered on a club stakeout Crockett and Tubbs - members of a Miami-Dade County PD vice squad that includes memorably a woman whos an expert sharpshooter - are distracted from their immediate task when a suicidal phone call from an informer alerts them to an FBI investigation into the drug trade. Unconvinced that white supremacists are the brains behind the operation and deputising as Feds they go undercover as traffickers in an attempt to infiltrate a Haitian cartel moving merchandise from Malaysia and Colombia via Florida to New York. From the first meeting with Jose (John Ortiz) and Isabella (Gong Li) its clear theyre putting their lives at risk; only later however do they realise how far theyve also imperilled those they love. So again we have Mann deploying generic material to create suspense aplenty while treating his abiding themes of professional/personal codes of honour conflicting responsibilities means and end trust and betrayal. An aura of authenticity is ensured by the scripts meticulous attention to detail and by the bold fluid direction and editing. At the same time Mann goes way beyond realism Dion Beebes often gritty handheld digital camerawork also serving to produce images at once intricate in their expressionist eloquence and mythic in their noir poetry. Amber nocturnal skies (think Collateral) a silent night raid on a house where a hostage is held (Manhunter) rooms overlooking azure seas (passim)... even the final shot echoes the opening of Heat. In short its business as usual for Mann. Truly terrific.

Starring Colin Farrell Jamie Foxx and Gong Li. Directed by Michael Mann. (R. 132 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Michael Mann is a film director of significance (""Last of the Mohicans"" ""The Insider"" ""Heat"") but he first became known to the public as the executive producer of the ""Miami Vice"" TV series which was a style-setting phenomenon in the mid-1980s. He returns to the scene of his first glory with ""Miami Vice"" the movie investing in it much of what hes learned directing features over the past 15 years. There are things not to like about ""Miami Vice."" That its too long that the story is confusing and not all that compelling and Mann can take the blame for that -- he wrote the screenplay. But theres really no arguing with how he directed the picture. Mann finds unconventional ways to shoot conventional scenes. He has an instinct for when to linger and when to move on. His compositions are gorgeous but not just gorgeous -- they create a feeling and invite reflection. And Mann gets strong performances from his actors. The performances that jump out of ""Miami Vice"" are not those of principals Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx who play Sonny and Rico Miami undercover cops doing high-stakes anti-drug work. Theyre both fine. Foxx fulfills his roles limited demands while the earnest Farrell suffers from the lingering memory of Don Johnsons insouciance. Still unless youve seen Johnson you wouldnt know there are possibilities there that Farrell doesnt find. Its the supporting players who stand out. Barry Shabaka Henley plays Sonny and Ricos boss a big wall of a guy with an impassive face that could be made of stone except for the sensitive watchful eyes. His opposite is Luis Tosar as the drug kingpin Montoya who appears to be a polite casually dressed balding fellow with a bushy beard -- hardly a monster until you look into his eyes and see not merely a coldness but a hatred of human life. ""I extend my best wishes to your families"" he says which from him is a bloodcurdling threat. Mann creates something interesting in presenting the circle around Montoya the kingpin our heroes want to bring down. In movies evil usually is flamboyant. Here its casual and mundane. Montoya and his girlfriend-business partner Isabella (Gong Li) sit in bed in their pajamas with a laptop talking about whom to murder and when. A malaise infects the whole organization with people occasionally springing to life but only in perverse ways. Montoyas underling Yero (John Ortiz) is a study in perversity disingenuous and murderous joking and threatening smiling and plotting a real piece of work. The casting of Gong is inspired. Her English is so shaky that easily 25 percent of the time her speech is impenetrable but oh how she says it. The idea of a beautiful Chinese woman running a South American drug cartel is in itself compelling and when Isabella becomes attracted to Sonny she becomes all the more sexy because shes scary. When will Mrs. Mantis bite off his head? The awakening of feeling in a woman who has previously been ice cold is nothing new in movies but Gong doesnt play the cliche. She remains powerful and her flashes of vulnerability -- only flashes -- are in their own way as alarming as her strength. This is not someone to toy with. Mann begins the movie with a sting operation in a nightclub but the storys not there -- it shifts gears into something about an undercover operation gone bad. An informant commits suicide by jumping in front of a truck and how do you think Mann conveys that visually? Does he shake the camera for no reason? Does he go for the blood and gore? No. He just shows the vehicle moving forward and a single streak of blood running down the middle of the lane. Minutes earlier Mann gives us the conventional scene of bad guys shooting up a car with people inside it. Weve seen that in scores of movies but Mann films the action from inside the car where it all feels more personal. The shots of the open ocean as seen from a motorboat heading to Havana on a summer night -- thats not just beautiful thats romance. Then again its 10 seconds of romance and thats the thing about ""Miami Vice"" Everything good or great about it is a disparate entity a shot a look a moment a feeling a suggestion. Even the intriguing element of Isabella and Sonnys involvement is just a subplot. The main action involves the crime-drama story and that doesnt have much interest. Worse it degenerates into virtual incoherence in the last third of the movie. Film critics are fed a steady diet of junk so to see a movie like this made by someone who actually knows what hes doing is to be tempted to overpraise it. But the truest thing to say about ""Miami Vice"" is that its an OK picture with some superb things in it. -- Advisory Extreme violence simulated sex sexual situations strong language.

Undercover detectives Sonny Crockett (Colin Farrell) and Ricardo Tubbs (Jamie Foxx) provide their own backup in Miami Vice. Photo Universal Studios Miami Vice 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Cool cars. Hot music. Chic people. Or maybe Hot cars. Chic music. Cool people. Or is it Chic cars. Cool music. Hot people. Parsing the cool-hot-chicness of Miami Vice has always been part (or all) of its appeal from the days of Don Johnsons rainbow-sherbet wardrobe up to this new vacantly slick elaboration from writer-director Michael Mann. Mann executive-produced the groundbreaking 80s cop show so he knows his way around slouchy hunks in Ray-Bans. The hunks have changed and the shades are now made by Sama but the essential qualifiers remain. Cool. Hot. Chic. The cars are Bentley Ferrari and fast. The music is Linkin Park and Moby. The people are Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx replacing Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas as Miami-Dade cops/zeitgeist exemplars Sonny Crockett and Rico Tubbs. Theyre both yummily photographed in yummy clothing (mostly cream and black; no sherbet) over a soundtrack of yummy dance beats and they both have the granitic-macho bearing of men doing important stuff with guns. What kind of stuff? Well the plot sends Crockett and Tubbs deep undercover as dope transporters hoping to find a leak in a multi-agency investigation of a white-supremacist drug ring. Sonny and Rico meet the rings main supplier Jose (John Ortiz) whos actually just a middle-man for Jesus (Luis Tosar) -- an unblinking South American overlord with a sophisticated global network. Jesus right-hand babe Isabella (Gong Li) swaps coolly assessing ogles with Sonny and eventually lures him to Havana for mojitos and passionless artful sex. Farrell and Li boast no chemistry to speak of but neither do Farrell and Foxx two charismatic leading men oppressed by excessive nightclub lighting and facial hair. Style trumps substance everywhere but thats no surprise; Vices main vice has always been its super-size guilty pleasures. The only surprise is how detached and perfunctory it all feels as though everyones going through the motions and no ones having any fun It has the runway-model ennui of labored hipness. Because were in Manns world -- the gritty-suave milieu of Collateral and Heat -- the violence is crackling and the gore well-staged. A few shockers are filmed obliquely A highway suicide is summed up in a bloody smear with succinct visual flare. Dion Beebes (Memoirs of a Geisha) shaky-cam photography runs from hyperzoom facial close-ups (even during sex) to glam shots of thudding night clubs and sun-dappled Caribbean waters. Sky and sea are streaked with sleek planes and muscular ""go-fast boats"" that signal Crockett and Tubbs dope-peddling panache. Sonnys windswept brow says more about his character though Im not sure what than any of the screenplays terse epigrammatic haikus (""Things go wrong the odds / catch up probability / is like gravity""). And unless I missed something huge no one ever pinpoints the identity of the leak just the agency behind it. Such trifling details. As a purveyor of character emotion or any other cinematic contraband Miami Vice is a go-fast boat on a path to nowhere. But it sure does look cool getting there -- cool hot and chic.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Perhaps distant thunder is a constant in South Florida. Because in ""Miami Vice"" it claps ominously and often. Michael Manns return to the hit show he created for the small screen in the mid-80s is heavy on atmospherics. Miami undercover detectives Sonny Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs ply their trade in pulsing nightclubs swank high-rise digs as well as impoverished Third World towns where drug-cartel honchos and their middlemen are fond of conducting business. ""Miami Vice"" begins with quick gestures meant to get Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxxs characters in deep fast. Covers have been blown. Agents get killed so does an informants family. Theres a leak in the alphabet bureaucracy FBI? DEA? Or? This dark and lovely-to-gaze-upon movie is more an example of Hollywoods vice than any other sort. Stylish it adds little to a conversation that ended in 1990 with Sonny going over to the dark - make that darker - side. Two years ago Mann told an interviewer ""Miami is not interesting now."" He had been praising Los Angeles where he shot the far superior ""Collateral."" He went on to cite Havana even Mozambique as places that intrigued him. ""You can imagine stories there; those are places where something could happen."" Now his comment seems prophetic. No wonder Sonny and Ricos cover takes them on the road air or sea so quickly If their passports were getting stamped theyd be as tattooed as the Aryan Brothers hired as savage enforcers. There was always a danger that at the end of this hefty-budgeted version of ""Miami Vice"" you might ask why? Why return to a television series that was so woven into the designer fabric of its cultural moment? Why return unless you had something new to say? Mann was the insurance against those questions. Not simply because of the time he took crafting the feel of the TV show or the time spent with Sonny and Rico played by Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas. In his best work Mann is smart and entertaining about the power dynamics of masculinity played out between cops and their quarry. In ""Heat"" he nailed it. In ""Collateral"" he tweaked that theme when he cast Tom Cruise as a sociopathic contract killer and Foxx as the taxi driver who must become a little like his unwanted fare in order to survive. Of course stars Foxx and Farrell were riders in that insurance policy too. But a curious thing happened on the way to the movie Foxx became a bigger star than Farrell. And that has shifted the balance between Tubbs and Sonny. Its a challenge the writer-director never quite resolves. Yes Manns good at choreographing a dance of wills. Yet most of the dancing in ""Miami Vice"" takes place in a salsa club in Cuba with Sonny whirling Isabella (Gong Li) the right-hand woman in the cartel he and Tubbs are infiltrating. ""Theres undercover then theres which way is up"" Rico tells Sonny in what should be a pivotal moment. His comment might have some edge if we bought that Sonny had lost his emotional bearings in falling for Isabella. But as central as it is to the ideas about undercover work and collaboration the romance seems perfunctory. This is not a Gong Li problem. This is a Farrell conundrum. Big movies like the sorry ""Alexander"" and the middling ""S.W.A.T."" have failed to capture what the actor delivers in indie features like ""Tigerland"" or this years ""Ask the Dust."" In a tense moment of negotiations middleman Jose Yero (John Ortiz) tells Tubbs ""You seem OK but him; I dont like how he looks."" No kidding. Farrell is a handsome guy yet theres little chance his Sonny will be launching any metrosexual makeovers. The actor didnt even hew to his characters look - and tragically unhip mustache - on a recent cover of ""Entertainment Weekly."" There are some fine if dismaying moments when Mann promises a sort of unblinking violence. The director doesnt dumb movies down. The film like its oddly rumbling sky promises more than it ever delivers. Granted it can look cool. But more often as we wait for the lightning that never arrives it frustrates. --------------------------- The Mann Producer writer and director Michael Mann created the TV series ""Miami Vice"" and he also directed the movie version opening today.

"Michael Manns Miami Vice reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Michael Manns Miami Vice reviewed. Michael Manns Miami Vice reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 27 2006 548 PM Mojito Coast Surrendering to the charms of Miami Vice. By Dana Stevens Listen to Dana Stevens Spoiler Special about  Miami Vice by clicking the arrow on the player below Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell in Miami Vice Its a measure of Michael Manns unique gift as a filmmaker that he manages to make stuff youd never want to do in real life--like grinding against Colin Farrell in a sweaty nightclub or exchanging gunfire with Nazi supremacists in a trailer park--seem strangely seductive and appealing. The world according to Mann is loud dangerous morally ambiguous and more than a little greasy but during the hours you spend there theres nowhere youd rather be. This is true even in films like Collateral (2004) in which Manns storytelling disintegrates into a whirl of stylized set pieces. Collaterals last 20 or so minutes are downright ludicrous but the impression you take away from it is still of a place--in Collaterals case Los Angeles--thats serious sophisticated and somehow fully adult. In Miami Vice (Universal) the nightscapes of L.A. are replaced by a transnational Mann-land Whether youre in Miami Havana or a lawless frontier city straddling the borders of Paraguay Argentina and Brazil theres no shortage of stark-white apartments with spectacular ocean views where gorgeous biracial women take long hot showers as Ramp;B throbs in the background. Advertisement Lest this all start to sound campy lets be clear In returning to his own Miami Vice series for source material Mann isnt mining the vein of 70s and 80s TV nostalgia that brought us movie versions of Starsky and Hutch Charlies Angels and The Brady Bunch. If anything its the TV show with its garish costumes and winking dialogue that feels like a sendup while the far grittier and darker film functions as the real thing. Mann treats the bygone series not as a brand but as a myth. He uses our background knowledge of it as shorthand the better to hurl us in medias res. Where were hurled turns out to be a pretty murky place indeed. After the identity of an informant (John Hawkes) is leaked and his family brutally killed detectives Sonny Crockett (Farrell) and Ricardo Tubbs (Jamie Foxx) go deep undercover to sniff out the rat. This leads them in two directions at once on the trail of a Cuban drug lord named Arcangel Jesus de Montoya (Luis Tosar) and into the dank depressing world of an American white-supremacist group that for reasons Mann never quite makes clear have seen fit to kidnap Tubbs girlfriend Trudy (Naomie Harris) an ass-kicking intel analyst. Meanwhile Crockett is falling hard for Montoyas woman a poker-faced Chinese-Cuban beauty named Isabella (Gong Li). In the movies most exhilarating scene she invites Crockett to take her out for a mojito--to Havana. As they skim across the Florida straits in whats referred to with good reason as a ""go-fast boat"" the viewer is drawn in by one of the oldest and most compelling reasons there is to go the movies Wed like to be doing that too--zipping off to Cuba for a no-strings night of passion with the likes of Gong Li--and this is as close as were ever gonna get. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Verbally Gong Lis performance is something of a disaster. She pronounces her English dialogue phonetically with a singsong intonation unrelated to its content. But Lis face communicates affect with the economy of a silent-film actress. Sonny and Isabellas romance as scripted is a pretty thin affair but somehow by the movies end I believed in their grand passion for each other. Colin Farrell who was laughably insubstantial as Alexander the Great in Oliver Stones Alexander brings a deep if inscrutable back story to his portrayal of Sonny Crockett a man willing to suspend the law in order to enforce it. Jamie Foxx wearing an oddly pubic tuft of chin hair seems uncharacteristically restrained as the more by-the-book Tubbs. He does get one down-and-dirty love scene with the missus but I would have liked to see him take off on a go-fast adventure of his own. The movies languid world-weary mood is punctuated rhythmically by earsplitting bursts of gory violence--its as if Sam Peckinpah had retired to Margaritaville. And while my viewing companion and I occasionally snickered at the existential bravado of the dialogue (""It is eleven forty-seven oclock and this is the hand we have been dealt"") we sobered up quick when the guts started to hit the fan. But for all its abundant gunplay Miami Vice is not without its moral center. ""Theres undercover"" Tubbs warns his partner as Crockett begins to fall under Isabellas spell ""and then theres which way is up?"" In Mann-land these distinctions--between right and wrong cop and criminal the world and the netherworld--matter big-time. At the risk of getting all existential myself theyre all weve got to separate us from savagery. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Along with his partner Ricardo Tubbs (Jamie Foxx) James ""Sonny"" Crockett (Colin Farrell) has infiltrated an ear-blastingly noisy nightclub where he proceeds to flirt with the bargirl. We can barely hear what theyre saying so how can they hear what theyre saying?No matter. Logic is not a strong point in this movie nor would we want it to be. On the other hand there are so many double- and triple-crosses so many double- and triple-agents that trying to make sense of it all is probably pointless. Writer-director Michael Mann who was a driving force behind the mid-80s ""Miami Vice"" TV series has never been one to sacrifice style for story. His new movie bears almost no resemblance to the TV show except for one crucial link They are both entirely about flair.At a time when genuine cinematic flair is in short supply this is no small achievement. Mann knows how to make a movie move and there are sequences in ""Miami Vice"" such as that initial nightclub rumble that are like swirling fantasias. The violent set pieces in this movie shot in high-definition video like Manns previous film ""Collateral"" resemble supercharged ballet. Since what we are watching at least as an exercise in style bears little resemblance to the real world we can sit back and bask in the sheer kickiness of it all. Its like gawking at the most expensive action video game ever devised. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? But pure style has its limits even for a virtuoso like Mann. We in the audience may not be taking ""Miami Vice"" all that seriously but he sure is. The film is about how Crockett and Tubbs penetrate a drug runners cartel and get in so deep they dont know which end is up. But its heartfelt core is the romance between Crockett and Isabella (Gong Li) the cartels slinky Cuban-Chinese ""financial officer."" In order to get information Crockett woos her in a speedboat that slices the seas. He reminds the wary Tubbs that its all an act. Of course we know otherwise. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 The only thing missing from this love-a-thon for the ages is chemistry. Farrell seems to have snapped out of his haze in ""The New World"" but Li is caught up in her own dreamtime. Shes all faraway looks and enigmatic smiles.The sex they engage in cant hold a candle visually to the shoot-outs. Given how eroticized Manns technique is even the sex scenes relatively tame by todays standards feel redundant.The Crockett/Isabella confab soaks up valuable screen time from Tubbs who has his own thing going with a pretty intel analyst (Naomie Harris) whose kidnapping is the action high point of the film. Foxx is really the supporting player in ""Miami Vice"" which is too bad since whenever he and Farrell are together your eye tends to favor Foxx.In addition to Miami the criminal universe of this movie also encompasses Paraguay Cuba and Colombia and the stakes are much higher than they were in the TV show. Now everything is globalized. (Im surprised Mann didnt work in Al Qaeda. Or did I miss something in all the noise?) Another change from the 80s is that cellphones and laptops are now an essential part of any self-respecting lawman or outlaws arsenal.But what hasnt changed is the high-flying hooey of Manns anything-for-effect stylistics. He is in love with the glamour of danger and corruption. Crockett and Tubbs may not have crossed over to the dark side but Mann just loves it there. Grade B+ Rated R for strong violence language and some sexual content.Sex/Nudity 1 instances of prostitution 5 sex scenes. Violence 9 scenes of violence. Profanity 27 strong expressions. Drugs/Alcohol/Tobacco 9 scenes with drinking 2 with smoking 3 scenes with drug dealing.

Comments Miami Vice Theres not much Miami but loads of vice in Michael Manns big-screen adaptation of the 80s TV series he created with Anthony Yerkovich--in particular the vice of a gifted director letting his talent go to seed. The pacing and proportion of Heat (1995) and the feeling for place and character evident in Collateral (2004) have been tossed aside for a routine plot in which vice cops Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx pose as drug dealers. Mann creates some arresting Scope compositions but hes so addicted to close-ups here especially erotic ones involving Gong Li (hot) and Farrell (not) that he tends to neglect their visual contexts. Apart from a few sleek shots involving boats or helicopters the action eventually devolves into a standard war-movie shoot-out. With Naomie Harris. R 135 min.

"Miami Vice Way Cool Then Now Not So Hot washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Miami Vice Way Cool Then Now Not So Hot Unreasonable facsimiles Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell dont do justice to Tubbs and Crockett. (By Frank Connor -- Universal Via Associated Press) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 28 2006 Michael Manns ""Miami Vice"" has a bad case of the jugglers blues. It tries to juggle Russians Cuban Chinese Paraguayans Irishmen African Americans Colombians boats cars sloppy hair beautiful babes loud music dope huge vulgar nightclubs jiggles and quivers and of course all the assault rifles known to man. Watching it is like running the new DVD version of the legendary television seriess first two years at FF x 60 -- oh but turned way down dark. Thats bad news especially for those of us who never missed a Friday night at 9 or 10 (it wandered) during the 80s (who said we had no lives?) and lived vicariously through the stylized musicalized heavily armed beautifully dressed adventures of icons Crockett and Tubbs. But the worst news about ""Miami Vice"" is that Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx replacing Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas in the key roles dont hold a candle a flashlight a freakin match to the original guys. Though they seem so two-decades-ago Crockett in his pastels and sockless white loafers and Tubbs with his surly mumbling and ever-buttoned double-breasted jacket and tie -- no matter the weather or the incoming -- the boys were at once McQueen-chilled hipster-chic and existential-exotic. They were uranium-depleted cool. Johnsons Crockett had a fallen Southern prince aspect to him as a former Florida wide receiver ruined by two years in Nam a failed marriage a weakness for women and booze but underneath it good-old-boy true grit. Tubbs by contrast was a black New Yorker with dead eyes and a drop-dead smile and a kind of musical sensibility. He represented the Afro-Caribbean presence that came to dominate Miami in the 80s and turn it into the American Casablanca. He could mix with the homeboys the Haitians the wraiths of color that brought their potions to a city on a bay that is never confused with Baltimore. By contrast as the infantile muttery ""stars"" of today do their thing you keep thinking Who are those guys? They have the charisma of salesmen for obsolete products. Would you buy an eight-track from them? Farrell appears to be a rarity in undercover culture a vice cop who disguises himself as an Irish beatnik. Oh thats a good disguise for South Beach. What he thinks the dopers will confuse him with Seamus Heaney? As for Foxx hes still channeling Ray Charles through squinty eyes and a kind of shaky head. And inquiring minds want to know Is this guys hair painted on? The lines they are so sharp. Both seem seriously disengaged or distracted. Perhaps Farrell was brooding on his reviews for ""Alexander"" and Foxx was regretting that fake jet picture last year. It follows then that they have zero chemistry Theres no affection or sense of joshing no needly rhythm between them as per the original specifications. They have no relation with their boss (not the great Edward James Olmos the shows center of gravity but journeyman hound-dog replica Barry Shabaka Henley) and their relationships with their women are the most uninteresting thing about the movie. And thats odd because the most interesting thing about the movie is those women. The gals are terrific. I wish the movie had been about them. Begin with Gong Li as Isabella a financial expert of Chinese Cuban background who alas works for the wrong people. This replicates a familiar story arc from the TV days. Crockett then as Crockett now was always falling for gals from the wrong side of the tracks and almost saving them with the purity of his heart and love. And if ever a woman deserved saving its the tough beautiful Isabella. Gong has a reedy little voice that at first seems wrong for her elegant beauty but then wins you over like Jean Arthurs cackle. Next up Naomie Harris as the Det. Trudy Joplin character played by Olivia Brown all those years ago. Harriss Joplin now emotionally involved with Tubbs simply to supply some arbitrary emotion to the equation is really tough. She has a good scene in which she uses her in-your-face patois on a reluctant snitch and turns him around on the dime. Shed turn anybody around on a dime. Later shes the central victim in the movies best sequence when shes kidnapped and the squad must pull off a SWAT raid to save her and put her kidnappers on the ground. Finally TV viewers will remember the elegant beauty Saundra Santiago as Det. Gina Calabrese Sonnys longtime occasional love interest. Gina has been re-Calabreseed this time as another toughie but one whos as much a SWAT stud as the guys. Played by a young woman named Elizabeth Rodriguez who looks as if she sprinkles cartridges on her cereal instead of sugar Gina takes command during the raid to free Trudy and has the movies best line when she advises a kidnapper holding a detonator and threatening to blow everybody up ""On the other hand I can put a 55-grain slug at 2700 feet per second into your medulla oblongata and your brain will be so dead it wont be able tell your finger to push the button."" I love it when they talk like that The plot is largely meaningless (as were the plots of the TV series) somewhere between ""not a lot of plot"" and ""lots and lots of plot."" The possibilities cancel each other out even for Mann who seems finally to give up and say ""You know lets just have a big pointless gunfight kill nearly everybody and let the audience sort them out if it wants to which it probably wont."" I certainly didnt.

"Miami Vice | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; miami-vice ) Miami Vice (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli The two best words to describe the 2006 motion picture Miami Vice are ""stylish"" and ""intense."" One of those descriptors without the other could lead one to suspect a pretentious bore or a pointless exercise in action but by pairing them writer/director Michael Mann has crafted a gripping visually interesting motion picture that doesnt fail on the basis of its needlessly convoluted plot and its hit-or-miss character arcs. As police dramas go Miami Vice never loses its audience in part because it is unpredictable (you never feel like anyone even the lead characters is destined to survive the proceedings) and in part because it never slows down. Calling the film Miami Vice is unnecessary - a marketing artifact. Aside from a few character names little of the 1980s TV show remains in the motion picture. The movie is more reminiscent of Manns films Heat and Collateral than it is of the television program his name became associated with. Viewers who go into Miami Vice with the baggage of expectations may be disappointed by what they find. Like The Untouchables this is a case in which the big screen version is a complete re-imagining of its small screen forebear. There are no cutting edge fashions. The music is new (even ""In the Air Tonight"" is a cover). And there are no cameos or instances of original stars reprising roles. (Although Edward James Olmos was offered the opportunity to return as Lt. Castillo scheduling conflicts with Battlestar Galactica forced him to decline.) The premise has Miami cops Sonny Crockett (Colin Farrell) and Rico Tubbs (Jamie Foxx) going undercover to discover and plug a leak in the FBI that has resulted in a busted sting and several deaths. Posing as transportation experts they meet with drug smuggler Jose Yero (John Oritz) and his associate Isabella (Gong Li) to propose that they replace Yeros current distribution apparatus and handle shipments of his illegal merchandise to the United States. Yero is suspicious but his boss Montoya (Luis Tosar) overrules him. Meanwhile Isabella acts as Montoyas go-between and begins an affair with Crockett. When it comes down to it theres not a lot of action in Miami Vice and most of it occurs during the final 30 minutes. Mann is an expert at sleight of hand however and the film seems more combustible than it is. A lot of that has to do with the throbbing soundtrack and a pervasive sense of danger. Scenes such as the one in which Crockett and Tubbs introduce themselves to Yero arent violent but they bubble with the potential for a bloodbath. Likewise Crocketts affair with Isabella treads along the razors edge of betrayal and catastrophe. The romantic interaction of the leads help to humanize them broadening them beyond the confines of the stereotypical ""rogue cops"" - tight partners who dont play by the rules. Theres chemistry in the seemingly unlikely pairing of Gong Li and Colin Farrell. Less attention is paid to the liaison between Jamie Foxx and Naomie Harris Trudy Joplin but this relationship has an important outcome. Farrell and Foxx are fine in their roles as long as one doesnt start comparing them to Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas. We believe these two are the smartest slickest cops to do this job - fearless in the face of death and willing to risk everything. One senses that the real payoff may not be getting the bad guys but getting off on the adrenaline of the chase and the thrill of dancing with the devil. International Chinese superstar Gong Li has difficulty with her English and Spanish (although to be fair there was little of her minimal dialogue that I didnt understand) but she does her best acting non-verbally. Her sex scene with Farrell is moving as we see tears in her eyes. Thereafter we observe the previously icy exterior thaw. John Ortiz is okay as the chief antagonist although hes hardly likely to challenge Alan Rickman or Dennis Hopper for a spot in the Villains Hall of Fame. Theres a noticeable absence of red in Miami Vice with blues being amplified. Contrast is low in many night scenes with noticeable grain. Whether these stylistic choices benefit Miami Vice is open to debate but they give the film a distinct look. In many ways the movie has a dirtier grittier feel than its TV counterpart. The 80s Miami Vice was pastels; the 2006 version is dark and at times almost monochromatic. The best way to view this new Miami Vice is as something unconnected to its previous incarnation. That way this version and the new interpretations of the actors can be allowed to stand on their own. As cop movies go Miami Vice does interesting things with unoriginal material. This is to its credit - movies with more have failed while this one succeeds on the basis of its fervor and immediacy. Its not the ultimate as either a cop movie or a TV adaptation but its better than average in both categories.

Yes its called ""Miami Vice"" and the two leads are named Sonny Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs but there any resemblance to the 80s TV show ends. Theres not a pastel T shirt in sight.On the subject of expectations fans of Michael Mann--and anybody interested in stylish hard-bitten cinema should be a fan--may expect something on the ambitious level of ""The Insider"" ""Heat"" or ""Ali."" They too should adjust their gaze. This down-and-dirty tale of drugrunning which sends Crockett (Colin Farrell) and Tubbs (Jamie Foxx) on a treacherous undercover mission from south Florida to Para-guay Havana Colombia and back again is a straight-ahead genre movie. Its filled with Manns signature macho verisimilitude but essentially its the stuff of what in saner fiscal times would have been a B movie. ""Miami Vice"" delivers the thrills atmosphere and romance it promises but it doesnt resonate like major Mann.Crockett and Tubbs have to penetrate the drugrunners ring to discover whos been ratting out the Feds undercover agents. This however proves to be something of a McGuffin as they stumble upon a globalized crime syndicate much bigger than the Aryan Brotherhood thugs they think theyre after. Crocketts pose as a drugrunner gets more complicated when he falls for the cartels sexy financial officer Isabella (Gong Li). The great Chinese star hasnt seemed comfortable in Hollywood fare (""Memoirs of a Geisha"") but Mann locates the lusty vulnerability under her snarl. Theres enough real passion between Farrell and Gong for the movie to get some emotional traction. The teaming of a rather torn and frayed Farrell and Foxx whos in lean fighting form is less memorable largely because Foxx is underutilized he vanishes for long stretches leaving the heart of the film to his costar. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Were meant to think that Crockett has gotten so deep into his double role that his true loyalties are up for grabs but the movies attempts at psychological nuance take a back seat to its shoot-outs and face-offs. The best of them is a precision-tooled set piece in which Tubbss kidnapped girlfriend (Naomi Harris) must be rescued from a heavily armed gang of rednecks.""Miami Vice"" has a distinctive look. Mann used high-definition video on ""Collateral"" but it could have been mistaken for film. Here cinematographer Dion Beebe goes for a dark scruffy texture that emphasizes rather than disguises the chilly electrified video textures. That may be a first for a big studio film. It seems appropriate that a property that began on the TV screen now helps usher in the era of big-budget video movies. As always Mann does it with style.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

""MTV cops"" was the note scribbled by the late NBC exec Brandon Tartikoff that famously inspired ""Miami Vice"" and while the music and color palette have changed (black it seems is the new pastel) writer-director Michael Mann has refreshingly revived the series largely intact. Unlike most TV-to-movie transitions Mann returns to his roots and delivers what amounts to a slightly overblown episode brimming with style and characteristically short on substance. As such pic doesnt feel dated but the question lingers whether young guys who were infants when the show expired in 89 will queue up for the ride. Using the grainy night-lensing techniques he brought to ""Collateral"" -- and reunited with that films co-star Jamie Foxx as well as cinematographer Dion Beebe -- Manns handsome adaptation eschews the campy spoofs and thinly veiled disdain for the source material (think ""Starsky amp; Hutch"" and ""Charlies Angels"") that have plagued TV-based movies; instead ""Vice"" revels in the creative latitude that an R-rated feature provides without departing from the shows rudimentary structure. That of course is for good and ill since the series was hardly known for its mellifluous language or complicated themes. As it is half the dialogue here sounds garbled with Colin Farrell (as Sonny Crockett) not so much speaking his lines as consistently snarling them in a manner that makes Don Johnsons initial take seem positively effusive. Crockett and Tubbs (Foxx) are again undercover Miami cops yanked into a botched FBI operation that has resulted in the death of a key informant. The dense (and mostly opaque) web of villainy includes a white supremacist group and a Colombian drug lord Montoya (Luis Tosar) who is as ruthless as he is wealthy calling the shots while sequestered in a jungle hideaway. In short order Crockett and Tubbs have wormed their way deep into the smuggling operation riding super-fast boats to ferry illicit contraband into South Florida for Montoyas henchman Jose (John Ortiz). With similar speed Crockett becomes entangled with one of the cartels leaders Isabella (Gong Li) both complicating matters and concerning his partner. Theres not much more to it but Mann -- the executive producer on the series -- fills out the story with lingering sensuality (including not one but two coed shower sequences) and terse but rousing bursts of action. The latter is highlighted by a hostage standoff that nicely shows off other members of their undercover unit who are otherwise mostly mute throughout the film. Foxx is the most conspicuously handcuffed by the no-nonsense attitude though other solid supporting players -- including ""Munichs"" Ciaran Hinds as the FBI liaison and Barry Shabaka Henley as Lt. Castillo -- have precious little to do as well. Gong meanwhile despite appearing to struggle with some of her dialogue brings welcome vulnerability to the role of Isabella which is about as much humanity as Mann cares to explore. Beyond that its all about gliding through a world of beachfront property dense jungle lairs (in addition to Florida filming took place in Paraguay the Dominican Republic Uruguay and Brazil) darkened clubs and the constant threat of exposure. Cinematically its territory Mann knows well -- from ""Thief"" early in his career to ""Heat"" to the more recent TV series ""R.H.D./LA"" -- and that mastery of brooding atmosphere buoys what would otherwise be an utterly by-the-numbers crime drama. The only notable omission in fact is Jan Hammers jaunty score from the original series (John Murphy does the honors) though song selections such as Phil Collins ""In the Air Tonight"" help rekindle some 80s feeling.
