Hes a literate Sinatra-loving sophisticate so why does his virginity feel like a terminal affliction? Male adolescent ferment was ever thus but leading man Michael Cera as hes done in Superbad Juno and Nick and Noras Infinite Playlist brings a remarkably sympathetic presence to the travails of dweebdom. Whether you feel youve already seen Cera strut his geeky stuff once too often may well determine your reaction to this adaptation of CD Paynes cult novel but its still passably diverting fare as he meets the girl of his dreams in the unlovely environs of the Restless Axles trailer park. She is Sheeni (Portia Doubleday) beautiful a total Francophile and has even heard of Yasujiro Ozu but to be with her hes going to have to escape from home. Hes going to have to be... a very bad boy.Quite a challenge for the congenitally meek Nick so he creates a moustachioed Gauloise-puffing alter ego Francois Dillinger to say and do things he cant quite manage himself setting in motion sundry jolly japes and escalating mayhem which complicate the pursuit of his affections. The tone throughout is moderately quirky rather than full-on teen-flick vulgarian bolstered by indie-cred cameos from Steve Buscemi (his nervy dad) and Ray Liotta (his moms psycho-cop suitor) and garnished with cute animated interludes. A little of everything actually which almost disguises the fact that the movies not overly amusing never truly insightful and trying rather too hard to be cultish. But we do like the Cera boy. We really do.

Plus Michael Cera sex machine? _ By David Edelstein Published Jan 11 2010 ShareThis (Photo Holly Horner/Courtesy of IFC Films) The young British actress Kate Jarvis is in nearly every shot of Andrea Arnolds Fish Tank and her wide face soft eyes and flickering mixture of longing and potty-mouthed defiance draw you in and keep you guessing over what shell do next. As Mia a 15-year-old who lives with her nasty little sister and self-centered single mother in a housing project shes high-strung and endlessly reactive with a slightly feral quality. Early on Mia hunts down a pal who dropped her then promptly head-butts a girl who calls her skanky and breaks her nose. As she stomps away you can feel her insides churn over her loss of control and Arnolds handheld camera is both on her and with her the emotion in every jitter and swerve. Alone in a vacant apartment Mia practices hip-hop to her portable CD player and tiny speakers then gazes through the window at the world outside. Her dancing helps to channel her feelings but despite big dreams shes no Billy Elliot and her accent and snaggly English teeth remind you where she comes from and what shes up against. Its her energy her attack that convinces you she wont go down without a fight. Arnolds first feature Red Road (2006) centers on another outsider a woman who monitors security cameras. The film is formally brilliant but it doesnt have the breathtaking openness of Fish Tank. Michael Fassbender plays her moms handsome new boyfriend Connor who encourages Mias dancing and gazes on her with sympathy and affection. Also with sexual hunger When Mia pretends to be asleep Connor carries her to her bed and Arnold slows down and eroticizes the moment. When he leaves and her eyes open you see shes more aroused than he is. Fassbenders Connor is never as nakedly manipulative as Peter Sarsgaards predatory Jew in the overrated An Education. When Connor yields to temptation his first reaction is shame and fear; he sees the bottom fall out of his life. Near the end Mia is overcome with hate and on impulse does something shocking nearly unforgivable. The sequence goes just to the verge of tragedy but Arnold is too compassionate to deliver the ultimate blow. The final scenes have a transcendent mixture of hope and sadness. Ive never seen anything like Mias final dance or the leave-taking with her little sister that follows. In Fish Tank nothing goes right yet Mias fate never seems preordained. Her constant motion might or might not be her salvation but it keeps you in suspense until the last frameand beyond. Miguel Artetas rollicking Youth in Revolt is one of several recent movies to elevate the generic coming-of-age teen sex comedy to a plane of surrealism. Superbad was a near-mythic odyssey into the unruly American libido Gentlemen Broncos a crazed Mormonism-fueled study in sublimation. I love this new breed of dirty movie. It goes beyond leering beyond sexism to the core tension of a culture that ricochets between Puritanism and promiscuity. And it has in Michael Cera a sterling mascot. Cera is the least sexually threatening juvenile in history. Hes skinny and hairless with zero muscle tone and a high head-voice that an eighteenth-century castrato would have killed for. To avoid projecting hysteria he affects a glassy deadpan. Yet he speaks fast and with startling precision as if hyperarticulateness might cover for his uncontainable bodily functions. In Youth in Revolt Cera has a marvelous pedestal for his sexual panic. BACKSTORYAs Nick Twisps sophisticated trailer-park lover Portia Doubleday makes her leading-lady debut. She had to take a leave from CalArts to do it and all of her teachers granted her an incompleteexcept for one. My drama teacher for this Theater 100 basic-basic-basic course said that I couldnt miss the group project says Doubleday. So my teacher gave me a D. The first ever in my life and its in theater. Stupid theater. Yeah theres a little pent-up animosity. Part farce part fever dream the movie is based on a novel by C. D. Payne called Youth in Revolt The Journals of Nick Twispthe twitty wispy moniker fitting Cera like a glove and not the kind you wear in winter. A disarming beauty named Portia Doubleday plays the irrepressibly teasing Sheeni Saunders whos turned on by everything French. So Nick concocts an alter-ego called Francois Dillinger (played by Cera with a pencil mustache) to liberate his id. Director Miguel Arteta keeps the action hurtling forward as Gustin Nashs script piles on crisis after crisis to the brink of absurdismcalamities that Nick leaves behind as his drive to have Sheeni propels him on. He ends up running from police in his undies and at one point a dress; in classic screwball style his libido both empowers and emasculates him. But when he tells her hed like to tickle her bellybutton from the inside and she gasps in pleasure at his newfound effrontery the humiliations he has gone through seem worth it. Of course Youth in Revoltlike all the movies in this genreis a straight-male fantasia. The hope is that women directors will come along and show horny boys the power of what theyre up againstalong with the anxieties that despite la difference they have in common. 1 2 Next Share this story...

He always plays nerdy wispy milquetoasts the more virginal the better. (Yes there are gradations. Even in Juno.) He always delivers his lines in a soft-spoken articulate monotone that feigns humility while underscoring the vast taproot of pop-cultural factoids at his disposal. Hes sometimes named Nick. And hes usually chasing the girl of his dreams. He is again in Youth in Revolt but with a twist -- rather a Twisp the semi-Dickensian surname of the Nick in question. Ceras character behaves as Ceras characters normally do (muttering pining chasing) only this time he conjures an invisible evil alter ego who tempts him to the dark side in pursuit of dream girl Sheeni (Portia Doubleday). Nick meets her while staying for the week in a trailer park; they round first base together but he worries hell lose her to Trent some 6-foot-2-inch guy who swims speaks French and writes ""futurist percussive poetry"" thats too weird to reprint here. Desperate Nick concocts a supplementary sexy persona someone ""bold contemptuous of authority and irresistible to women."" The alter egos name is Francois Dillinger and he looks like a refugee from an old Alain Delon movie cigarette mustache dinky white pants. Hissing out dirty words and bad advice in a darkened Cera monotone Francois proceeds to get Nick in hot water with his mother (Jean Smart) his mothers beau (Ray Liotta) his father (Steve Buscemi) Sheenis parents (M. Emmet Walsh and Mary Kay Place) and a couple of different law-enforcement agencies. Directed by Miguel Arteta in his first feature outing since 2002s The Good Girl Youth in Revolt is based more or less on C.D. Paynes epistolary series. Gustin Nashs screenplay boasts the same irreverent humor and hipster sass that he brought to Charlie Bartlett but theres no moody aftertaste or moral to the story. Its just an occasion for super-articulate humor and deft character bits especially Zach Galifianakis as his mothers other boyfriend this one an idiot or Adhir Kalyan as a loquacious salacious high schooler. Cheeky animations are sprinkled about for good measure including one that floats off the pages of a sex manual. Justin Long plays Paul who lurks nearby dispensing hallucinogens. All in all Youth in Revoltis a clever and often riotous burst of cynicism that pushes lets face it some pretty questionable ideas. To win the gal of your dreams you should... embark on a crime spree? Bad-mouth rivals steal cars sedate people endanger lives and grow imaginary mustaches? And if you dont get along with someone you should ply them with shrooms? Apparently. When Buscemi plays the voice of adult responsibility we know were in trouble. I doubt that Arteta (or anyone else involved) is truly advocating the full-on criminal rebellion of horny teens. This is only a movie only a boy-meets-girl with a Twisp. But in the end -- after all the amorality and anarchy and anti-establishment acting-out -- the tale of Sheeni and Nick gets wrapped in a trim little bundle of Hollywood cliches. Cera might be comfortable with it but Francois disapproves. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals 4-Panel Abstract Wall Art by Jon Allen for 145 + free shipping Defiant LED Flashlight 3-Pack for 10 + pickup at Home Depot ThinkGeek Summer Clearance Sale Up to 65% off + free shipping...

Rick Groen From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Thursday Jan. 07 2010 255PM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 313PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Youth in Revolt Directed by Miguel Arteta Written by Gustin Nash Starring Michael Cera and Portia Doubleday Classification 14A With his doe-brown eyes curly locks lanky frame and velveteen voice Michael Cera is the walking/talking embodiment of teenage vulnerability and hes dined exclusively off that cute image throughout his young career - in Superbad  in Juno  in Nick and Noras Infinite Playlist . Its a likeable piece of typecasting and the guy is awfully good at polishing his rep. At least until now. In Youth in Revolt  Cera bellies up to the same table once too often. His fresh-faced act is starting to look really stale. Admittedly the actor gets no help from the script here. Its a weak adaptation of C.D. Paynes picaresque novel the sort of screenplay that undermines the source material by consistently making wrong-headed decisions - on one hand adding too much; on the other not subtracting enough. Although the setting is allegedly Oakland the locations are just a vague backdrop and the time seems completely out of joint - who knows when? Instead in the opening frame the movie finds its only certainty in cliche when Ceras Nick Twisp emerges from beneath the bed sheets having just enjoyed a DIY orgasm to announce in plaintive voice-over ""Needless to say Im still a virgin."" Needless indeed. Directed by Miguel Arteta Youth in Revolt stars Michael Cera and Portia Doubleday. What follows of course is another odyssey in quest of bidding adieu to innocence. Nicks milieu is meant to be colourfully down market but the white-trash decor feels too preciously contrived. Like his divorced parents - Mom (Jean Smart) is a blowsy bottle-blonde hooking up with her serial boyfriends; Dad (Steve Buscemi) is a demi-jerk who unaccountably enjoys the favours of a bikini-clad trophy babe. Somehow despite his surroundings Nick has emerged to transform himself into well Michael Cera with all the usual tropes impeccably intact - you know the ironic self-deprecating genteel nerd sufficiently cerebral (in this case a fondness for classic lit and Fellini films) to spark deep-rooted fears that hell never get laid. By now we aint too worried for him. Soon enough neither is he when the trailer trash take a vacation to the trailer park and up pops the beautiful Sheeni (Portia Doubleday). The girl has woeful parents too - theyre a couple of religious fanatics - but the teens bond over their shared reverence for Godard and quickly get down to some heavy petting. All thats left is the climax at the climax but since thats two full acts away there are obstacles to be thrown up impediments to overcome. So suddenly supporting characters start breeding like brash rabbits and what began as a trite yet coherent yarn degenerates into a bumper-car collision of antic incidents. Literally since cars are the star vehicles - they get parked in living rooms they smash through shop windows they plunge into shallow lakes doing yeomans work playing the gridlock in a stalled narrative. Meanwhile his love still unconsummated and understandably frustrated by these delaying tactics Nick takes a page from the superheros handbook and invents an alter ego a bad boy named Francois. Why bad? Hey cause hes French and has a mustache and smokes unfiltered cigarettes and peppers his speech with the very four-letter word that virginal Nick longs to act out. Since director Miguel Arteta chooses to put Francois on screen right next to his nerdy half Cera finally has a chance to perform against type to stretch his acting muscles and for once stop being so damned cute. And stretch he does - an inelastic millimetre or two. Asked to go from pussycat to tiger all he does is meow louder. It hardly matters. Cera may be trapped in his unchanging persona but no more than this picture is walled in by its sitcom conventions. There where loudness reigns - loud plots loud characters - youths are reactionaries only posing as rebels and their revolt is just noise in want of a laugh-track.

Sure enough the movie is a quirky-hip teen-angsty sad-sweet comedy about a young man who feels destined and cursed to never get the girl. Then against all odds he does. Movie Information Youth in RevoltRatingShowtimes | Official site | TrailerDirector Miguel ArtetaActors Michael Cera Portia Doubleday Jean Smart Steve Buscemi Zach Galifianakis Ray Liotta Fred Willard and Justin LongRun time 90 minutesMPAA rating R (sexual content language and drug use)Synopsis Michael Cera stars in this movie based on the 1955 novel.More movies from GuideLive.comPlease dont mistake that last sentence as a spoiler. Its built into the narrative DNA of this style of teen romance that Youth in Revolts two misfit toys end up on their own private island of love. And since Cera graduated from TVs Arrested Development he has become the official face of the awkward adolescent suitor in movies from Juno and Superbad to Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist and now Youth in Revolt.Cera plays Nick Twisp a young man who loves ""classic prose"" and Frank Sinatra and hates most of the rest of his life particularly his moms (Jean Smart) assembly line of loser boyfriends and his dads (Steve Buscemi) fondness for young girlfriends. Director Miguel Arteta and screenwriter Graham Nash quickly establish the mood-setting boundaries of Nicks life Hes smart funny and shy; his parents are divorced and both view him as at best a burden; his only friend is even more miserable than he is; every adult he deals with is selfish stupid and-or crazy.So Nicks sarcasm and edgy introversion arent just affectations they are requisite items in his daily-living survival pack. When moms latest loser-boyfriend Jerry (Zach Galifianakis in a regrettably slight role) dumps a junker car on a trio of revenge-seeking sailors the family goes on a vacation-getaway to a trailer in a lakeside town where Nick meets Sheeni (Portia Doubleday) - cue the radiant sunlight and angelic choir. Sheeni is Nicks fantasy girl made flesh smart cynical beautiful. She hates her loser parents (MVP performances from M. Emmet Walsh and Mary Kay Place) just like Nick and she has ruthlessly exacting taste in movies music and literature just like Nick.When Nick is cruelly torn from his first and perfect love he vows to Sheeni that he will do what needs to be done to return to her. That means being bad really bad something the constitutionally polite and ineffectual Nick has a hard time being. In the movies (not to mention Ceras career) greatest invention Nick dreams up his evil twin Francois Dillinger a chain-smoking alter ego who with his pencil-thin mustache and holiday wardrobe looks as though he stepped out of one of those French movies Sheeni adores.Francois is everything Nick isnt - a cocky assured rebel without a care. Ceras twin performances are pitch-perfect. The ease and authority with which he inhabits Francois is the first real sign of life after baby-faced adolescence for a talented actor who has thus far been performing just one admittedly great trick. Hes so good as Francois that once hes been introduced you miss him whenever hes not on-screen. Fortunately there are plenty of other great actors popping up in this movie to distract you Ray Liotta as a bloated boorish cop who becomes moms next idiot-boyfriend; Fred Willard as the goofy neighbor; and Justin Long as Sheenis stoner brother.Youth in Revolt is a movie bound to provoke strong love-hate reactions. Its full of cult-movie flourishes like the Claymation credit sequence that drops in after an extended intro and the cartoon montages that suddenly appear. Some may find such elements desperate or calculated in their quirky-cuteness but I think they add to the movies efforts to evoke the surrealism and excruciating intensity of as the title puts it youth in revolt. Thats an ambition the movie mostly lives up to. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

Scheming to win back his lady love he creates for himself a bad-boy alter ego whose impulsive criminality soon has him on the run from the law. Mildly diverting rather than uproarious the film still stands out among teen sex comedies for its low-key approach to antic material.

(Bruce Birmelin) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday January 8 2010 The coming-of-age sex comedy ""Youth in Revolt"" finds Michael Cera stuck in his same wispy doe-eyed groove. This StoryYouth in Revolt If youve played one awkward teenager . . .Watch Youth in Revolt trailerYouth in Revolt showtimes tickets Even Ceras biggest fans have to admit he has become something of a Johnny One-Note -- that note being high quavering and perpetually on the verge of fatal mortification. Ceras gift for capturing the adolescent state of chronic embarrassment served him well in the TV series ""Arrested Development."" And it made for perfect casting in such high school comedies as ""Juno"" and ""Superbad."" But by ""Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist"" and last years pseudo-documentary ""Paper Heart"" the falsetto diffidence was wearing thin. In ""Youth in Revolt"" Miguel Artetas adaptation of the C.D. Payne novel audiences are still supposed to buy the 21-year-old Cera as high school student Nick Twisp who lives in sex-obsessed misery with his divorced mother and her succession of loser boyfriends. When Nick meets the disquietingly frank Sheeni Saunders (Portia Doubleday) during a family getaway at a trailer park in California he decides to do whatever it takes to be with her -- a vow that will entail random acts of theft arson dorm-rule violations and cross-dressing. Arteta (""Star Maps"" ""Chuck amp; Buck"") admittedly brings fresh eyes to the story maximizing its absurdist humor and using animation to stage some of the episodic storys more procedural sequences. And Cera at least tries with limited success to break free of his usual mannerisms when he plays Nicks alter ego a suave sophisticate named Francois Dillinger. But ""Youth in Revolt"" strains as it toggles between observational and slapstick humor. Whats more the characters all seem to be speaking in the same arch hyper-literary drone -- that is if theyre not dumb trailer-park-dwelling rubes. ""Youth in Revolt"" is a movie that feels written rather than lived; from ""The Catcher in the Rye"" to ""Rushmore"" its a story weve seen in better versions before.  R. At area theaters.

"Film review Youth In Revolt overcomes the odds - Mercury News Hot Topics Big Sur fire Balloon crash No-parachute skydive Deadline 29 to Vegas Sheryl Sandbergs Option B Steve Torrence Ask Amy Comics SV150 Print Email Font ResizeFilm review Youth In Revolt overcomes the oddsBy Randy Myersrmyersbayareanewsgroup.comPosted 01/08/2010 120000 AM PSTClick photo to enlargeMichael Cera and Adhir Kalyan in ""Youth in Revolt.""<<12>>A curious cinematic phenomenon occurs on Fridays in early January with the annual migration of ""dirty little studio secrets.""The dubious practice finds Hollywood bigwigs dumping innocuously titled -- and often formulaic -- films such as ""Leap Year"" or ""Daybreakers"" both opening today into theaters. But occasionally a film overcomes the odds of a lousy trailer a studios no-confidence vote and a pingponging release date.The teen sex comedy ""Youth in Revolt"" does just that.Released by movie execs with the same amount of respect normally accorded a cheatin ex ""Youth in Revolt"" represents a studio nightmare and an indie movie lovers daydream.Obviously Dimension Films the movies distributor has no idea what to do with such an edgy comedy. The press notes even come across as stale and in need of updating as if ""Youth"" sat poised to be released until some offended focus group gave bean counters the willies. Perhaps the characters in-your-face drug use including one hilarious but overdone bit involving hallucinatory mushrooms made them balk. Or maybe it was the rebellious antics of its 16-year-old protagonist Nick Twisp (teen angst magnet Michael Cera) who at one point practically destroys ""half of Berkeley"" in his bid to be bad so he can be with his wannabe-girlfriend Sheeni (breath-of-fresh-air newcomer Portia Doubleday). Advertisement Whatever the reasoning the result is a brassy and unique production that might eventually land in the same cult classic territory as the C.D. Payne book its based on. (Payne lives in the Bay Area and -- like the film -- his series of bestselling Twisp novels is set in Northern California.)""Youth in Revolt"" does have issues to resolve and the biggest one is Cera. With his gangly body and nerdy appearance hes more than physically up for playing the role of Nick Twisp an Oakland teen with a fondness for Frank Sinatra and an affectation for Jean-Luc Godard films. The ""Arrested Development"" star gets the chance to toy with his geeky on-screen persona by also playing Nicks bad-boy alter ego the white-panted blue-Oxforded Francois. Francois nudges Nick to give into his base instincts a story convention that doesnt always work. Cera is such an obvious choice for the role of Nick that you wonder what a lesser-known young actor could have done with the character. Simply put this a part the talented Cera could do in his sleep. His performance holds no surprises and is interchangeable with any of his roles from other films.The rest of the cast is more inspired and fun to watch. As Nicks divorced mother and father the always excellent Jean Smart (TVs ""Samantha Who?"") and Steve Buscemi (""The Messenger"") turn bad parenting into a comic art form. ""The Hangovers"" Zach Galifianakis and Ray Liotta (""Wild Hogs"") as two of Nicks moms many beaus are perfect. Other pros classing up the joint include Fred Willard (""Best in Show"") as an Oakland activist who shelters illegal immigrants in his basement Mary Kay Place (""Its Complicated"") and M. Emmett Walsh (""Blood Simple"") as Sheenis clueless fundamentalist parents and Justin Long (""Drag Me to Hell"") as their druggie son. Among the new faces Adhir Kalyan and Doubleday stand out Kalyan as Nicks articulate and extremely horny friend and Doubleday as the object of Nicks affections.Director Miguel Arteta (""The Good Girl"") allows his talented cast members room to stretch their acting muscles but occasionally he struggles with the good boy-bad boy plot conventions. The device of having two Ceras appear on-screen sometimes seems strained. Arteta adds some nice touches such as clever animation and gives the film a realistic look even though hes working under tight budget restrictions. (No matter how hard he might try Michigan is a poor mans imitation for Berkeley Oakland Santa Cruz and Ukiah. But I have to say its good to see my hometown of Ukiah mentioned so often.)Given all thats good about ""Youth in Revolt"" the studios lackluster release will likely mean itll thrive on DVD. Dont wait for that. ""Youth in Revolt"" is worth making a trip to the theaters.

This particular lapse will be forgivable -- it may even become a trend among members of 21st century senile generations -- because as moviegoers we will all have been there with him for multiple attempts and some successes. There was the fruitful encounter in the chair in Juno and the time we almost went all the way with him on a couch in Nick amp; Norahs Infinite Playlist. We would have done it in Superbad if vomit hadnt been an issue. And now in Miguel Artetas uneven but occasionally quite funny Youth in Revolt (an adaptation of C.D. Paynes successful mid-90s book Youth in Revolt The Journals of Nick Twisp) we watch as Cera by way of a devilish alter ego he calls Francois Dillinger engages in criminal acts in hopes that theyll lead to carnal acts with a girl who likes bad boys. (See the top 10 movies of 2009.) Cera is Nick Twisp the hyper-intelligent son of a divorced Oakland Calif. couple foolish Estelle (Jean Smart) and aggrieved George (Steve Buscemi) who would rather not pay child support. Nick a self-proclaimed voracious reader of ""classic prose"" watches in disgust as his mother makes out with her scam-artist boyfriend Jerry (Zach Galifianakis cinematic slob du jour). Across town Dad is groping his young girlfriend Lacey (Ari Graynor Ceras hilarious co-star from Nick amp; Norah). Given his exquisite dorkiness Nick appears to have no chance of losing his virginity anytime soon but naturally sex is all he thinks about. His chances brighten when Jerry on the lam takes Nick and his mother with him to a trailer park near Clear Lake called ""Restless Axles."" (The film was shot in Michigan not Northern California which may explain why Arteta uses Claymation and graphics to depict all the road trips; it might have been a penny saver.) There Nick meets Sheeni Saunders (Portia Doubleday) a luscious teenager who is just as pretentious as Nick and not quite as innocent. ""Ive only made love once"" she tells him. ""It was less than erotic."" Sheeni shares a souped-up trailer with her devoutly Christian parents (M. Emmet Walsh and Mary Kay Place). (See the top 10 movie bromances.) The film seems to think Sheenis parents should be punished for their religious beliefs assuming a hypocrisy that is often ascribed to Christians in film but in this case seems absent; the Saunders are mostly just humorless and unfriendly. The anti-adult attitude extends ultimately to every grownup in the film. Jean Smart is a good comic actress but what can you do when youre written as a one-dimensional slattern held in contempt by your hipster child? Even the best of the grownups the friendly hippie-dippie neighbor (Fred Willard) is something of a grotesque. This isnt so much youth in revolt as youth in disdain which seems ironic given how much Nick and Sheeni long to have access to the ways of the adult world including travel and freedom and yes sex. Sheeni it turns out is tentatively open to relieving Nick of his virginity. She does have a boyfriend -- an athlete poet and French speaker named Trent -- but shes game for any new admirers. Theres a captivating smugness to Doubleday; when she flirts you see traces of Sue Lyons Lolita. She and Nick court in a flurry of name-dropping a romantic version of Amazons ""If you liked this youll love this"" routine. For her its anything French from Godards Breathless to Serge Gainsbourg and though Nick favors Frank Sinatra he adapts. When Sheeni encourages him to be bad as part of a scheme to get him banished to Clear Lake Nick develops his alter ego. (See the top 10 movie performances of 2009.) Francois also played by Cera smokes has a pencil-thin mustache and wears a costume of pristine white trousers blue shirt and white loafers without socks. Superbad he wantonly destroys property and several cars and plays Cyrano for Nick. Francois and Nick appear in the frame together which sounds like great fun but mostly feels like a Saturday Night Live skit in which the writers spoof Ceras reputation for being one-note. Maybe he is. Only time and a few roles in which hes not playing an anxious virgin will tell. The movie was a bad choice for him given his resume. But there are moments when you are surprised and delighted by his soft subversive delivery and the way hes turned his distinctly non-Hollywood body into an asset. You think Theres no one quite like this kid (well except for Jesse Eisenberg who also dealt with the burden of virginity in Adventureland). And there is guile in Francoiss eyes which suggests that someday Cera will indeed play a different kind of part and quite possibly very well. See the best pictures of 2009.

"Youth in Revolt Evil twin role reboots Michael Ceras career | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesYouth in Revolt Evil twin role reboots Michael Ceras careerMichael Cera desperately needs a guy like Francois Dillinger.Hes the evil twin of Ceras nerdy (what else?) Nick Twisp in Youth in Revolt.Portia Doubleday teams up with Michael Cera who also plays a sociopathic French hipster in a story based on a series of 1990s cult novels.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Jan. 8 2010 Starring Michael Cera Portia Doubleday Steve Buscemi Jean Smart Zach Galifianakis and Ray Liotta. 90 minutes. Directed by Miguel Arteta. At major theatres. 14AMichael Cera desperately needs a guy like Francois Dillinger.Hes the evil twin of Ceras nerdy (what else?) Nick Twisp in Youth in Revolt a coming-of-age comedy that may help convince casting directors that Cera can play more than just dweebs. Article Continued BelowAnd that just may be the whole point of this envelope-pushing exercise for Bramptons brightest light. At the age of 21 Cera has managed to get himself so cemented as the shy and stumbling type in movies like Juno Superbad and Paper Heart you could swap his characters between films and people wouldnt notice.Its almost the same story in Youth in Revolt since Nick is just another virginal nerd desperately pining to get a girl or find the meaning of life whichever comes first. Cue the twee folk tunes.If this were all the film had going for it it would be pretty thin Pablum. But Cera gets the good foot on the bad thing with Dillinger a pencil-moustached sociopath doppelganger whom Nick summons straight from the id to do his romantic dirty work. Its the only way hes going to stand a chance with Sheeni Saunders (Portia Doubleday bright young thing) a girl he meets at a Christian trailer park who shares his pop-cult interests but not his geekishness. She instructs Nick to ""be bad"" to win her love even though thats probably not what Jesus would do.Enter Francois Dillinger who is equal parts French New Wave hipster and Public Enemy No. 1. Whenever Nick seems about to waver in his obsessive drive to bed Sheeni Dillinger magically appears to harangue heckle and vandalize in the name of lust - and this includes literally setting the town square ablaze.Its an amusing concept as far as it goes although it doesnt go far enough. Youth in Revolt is based on the multi-volume cult novel published by Ohio writer C.D. Payne in the 1990s and screenwriter Gustin Nash (Charlie Bartlett) and director Miguel Arteta (Chuck amp; Buck The Good Girl) evidently felt compelled to include as many tangential characters as possible.Some of these are funny although they also tryst with typecasting. Zach Galifianakis does his usual loutish turn as Jerry the lying boyfriend of Nicks divorced mom (Jean Smart). Ray Liotta does his patented bad-cop routine as Lance another man in moms life. And Steve Buscemi adds another note to his sour symphony as Nicks libidinous dad dating a girl half his age. Add in various neighbours nags and nuts played by Fred Willard Mary Kay Place Justin Long and others and you have a story thats busier than a teen boys hormones. And whats with the pointless claymation interludes which seem stolen from the Napoleon Dynamite playbook and do nothing to advance the plot? What we really want to see is more Dillinger who puts the cause into this rebel. When hes on the screen painting the town red with flames or setting Nicks nerves on edge the movie really becomes something more than just the same old same old from Cera.If theyre smart Cera and his agent will make a show reel of the Dillinger bits and shop them around Hollywood. Times a-wasting for his career.

Paynes mischievous young-adult novel. (Dimension Films) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday January 7 2010 359 PM Title Youth in Revolt Its become popular to criticize Michael Cera for sticking to variations on one theme the sensitive bumbling romantic. So it makes sense that hed sign up for ""Youth in Revolt"" which allows him to show off his wilder side.Or at least that seems to be the theory. In reality nothing here quite works out as it should.Director Miguel Arteta significantly softens his source C.D. Paynes mischievous young-adult novel. But the hero remains Nick Twisp a nerdy teen crazy about beautiful Sheeni Saunders (Portia Doubleday). Bouncing between his trashy mom (a fun Jean Smart) and angry dad (Steve Buscemi) Nick keeps his sights set on Sheeni. She however is not interested in an awkward virgin. So he develops an alter ego Francois whos tough enough to steal cars set fires and hit on gorgeous girls. But the real trouble begins when Nick forgets which side of his personality matters most.Arteta who directed the immensely superior ""The Good Girl"" never gets a handle on Paynes darkly comic voice. So he overcompensates by piling on the quirks with random animated sequences and a self-consciously deadpan tone.More problematic is the lack of cohesion. Newcomer Doubleday makes Sheeni a remote beautiful tease which suits an adolescent fantasy but wont seduce an audience. And while Cera is charming enough to keep us watching hes never allowed to cut loose -- even though thats supposed to be the whole point of the movie. Francois ultimately resembles every other character Cera has played only with a mustache and a dirtier mouth. If he wants to show us what else he can do hell need to stage a much bigger rebellion than this.

Dweeby Nick (Michael Cera) who is in love with Sheeni (Portia Doubleday) copes by having a bad-boy alter ego. ABOUT THE MOVIEYouth in Revolt  1/2 out of fourStars Michael Cera Portia Doubleday Steve Buscemi Jean Smart Fred Willard Mary Kay Place Ray Liotta Zach GalifianakisDirector Miguel ArtetaDistributor Dimension FilmsRating R for sexual content language and drug useRunning time 1 hour 30 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Nick Twisp insists he isnt mentally ill. Hes just a teenager. But he does invent a second persona to help him cope with the challenges posed by raging hormones and clueless parents. TRAILER Get a glimpse at Youth in Revolt Nick is played with intellectual vigor and youthful angst by Michael Cera the go-to guy for awkward nerdy/cute virginal young men. As Nick his rebelliousness is kept in check. But obedience and propriety are tossed aside by his alter ego Fran?ois Dillinger an arrogant mustachioed cigarette-puffing smoothie who comes complete with an ascot. Cera plays the dual role of Nick and Fran?ois; its a pleasant surprise to see the engaging soft-spoken star of Superbad and Juno stretch and play a devil-may-care slimeball. While Nicks instinct is to be is affable and mildly sarcastic Fran?ois eggs him on to criminal behavior all in the name of love. Nick is hopelessly besotted by teenage Francophile Sheeni Saunders (a likable Portia Doubleday) whom he met on vacation and who shares his affection for foreign cinema and Frank Sinatra. Sheeni incites Nick the only child of irresponsible parents (Jean Smart and Steve Buscemi) to break out of his humdrum existence. Director Miguel Arteta who made the eccentric Chuck amp; Buck (2000) and the darkly droll Good Girl (2002) is a good choice to adapt C.D. Paynes Salinger-esque 1993 cult novel Youth in Revolt The Journals of Nick Twisp. Artetas talent for bleak comedy and extreme characters has been evident since his first film 1997s Star Maps. Youths screenplay by Gustin Nash is generally witty. The dialogue is so self-consciously ornate however that it can sound forced and artificial coming out of every teenagers mouth. Snappy banter is always preferable to predictable chatter but it also can sound excessively and formally scripted. Unlike Juno whose lead character spouted a singularly quirky patois here every young person casually engages in intellectual and amusing repartee. The adults in contrast are vacuous and much less articulate. Characters weave in and out of Nicks increasingly outlandish adventures. Zach Galifianakis (The Hangover) and Ray Liotta are loutishly funny as the loser boyfriends of Nicks mom and M. Emmet Walsh and Mary Kay Place are comically overbearing as Sheenis ultra-religious parents. Fred Willard is first-rate as Nicks neighbor. Edgy coming-of-age stories are almost a genre in themselves and their arch cleverness can border on cliche. But Youth in Revolt sidesteps that pitfall with its farcical style and the chemistry of its leads as well as with Ceras dashing/dweeb duality.

Doh She has a boyfriend.       Photo Photo Credit Bruce Birmelin Leading global energy sources oil coal and embarrassingly prolonged teen-boy virginity. The combustible latter fuels ""Youth in Revolt"" -- an improbable but hilarious combine of losin-it comedies and the rarefied Europhile air of the Cinema du Twee. Its Wes Anderson minus the angst. I have little doubt that ""Youth in Revolt"" will sail far over the heads of most of todays youth to their eternal shame and taste-damnation. The only moment in the movie that seems remotely realistic comes when a girl notes an intellectual classmates choice of ""La Strada"" in the video store breaks into fits of embarrassment giggles and blurts ""Thats so random"" The lad of letters is Nick Twisp (Michael Cera) seeker aesthete virgin. He boils with hormonal surges yet his wrath is impotent. Among those he would smite are his slutty mom (Jean Smart) her truck-driver boyfriend (Zach Galifianakis) her cop boyfriend (Ray Liotta). A vacation sojurn to a ""cabin"" in the woods -- actually a trailer in a land of lost souls called Restless Axles -- redirects his trajectory to cross that of one Sheeni Saunders (a canny Portia Doubleday in her first major role) who is not only adorable but unlike Nick can correctly identify the director of ""Tokyo Story."" Alas she has a boyfriend (""he writes futurist percussive poetry"") so permanent Nick seems to have little chance with her. Unless he can meet Sheenis demands to ""be bad Nick. Very very bad."" He obliges by creating an alter ego ""Francois Dillinger"" an insouciant white-pantsed rebel with the kind of mustache that suggests a fondness for Nestles Quik rather than successful completion of puberty. But Francois also has an arrogant way with a cigarette and a facility for naughty badinage. The two of them -- Nick and his shadow -- go roaming the paths that outlaws tread scheming to win Sheenis hand by getting Nick thrown out of his house her thrown out of her French-immersion prep school and her preppy boyfriend left alone to ponder his futurist word-smashing. What is most refreshing about Twee Cinema -- the Quirkist School -- is that when they work films like ""Juno"" and ""Rushmore"" find the comedy in youth aching to be older casting off plumes of weirdness in all directions by reversing the American norm. Nick savors Sinatra records while Sheeni is partial to Serge Gainsbourg and Jean-Paul Belmondo. ""Juno"" and ""(500) Days of Summer"" forced many of their lines and their contrivances often seemed . . . contrived. (Take the bursting-into-song sequence in ""Summer."") ""Youth in Revolt"" features animated sequences choreographed to the kind of alt-rock that sounds like wounded birds afraid to leave the nest but theyre funny and endearing as is the arch dialogue. Every scene has lines fit for Bartletts the cool edition ""Bernice you sweet angel of the lavatory"" ""Like John Muir I enter the wilderness with nothing more than my journal and a childlike sense of wonder."" ""Kiss me you weenie"" effectively deflates a moment while a reference to the ursine Galifianakis as ""my mothers consort"" absurdly elevates him. Questions of taste could have smothered the film but director Miguel Arteta leaves the art direction the hip soundtrack and the oddball references to support his stars rather than compete with them. The focus remains on who the characters are and what they want. These teens may name their dogs after Camus but their goals are pure ""Superbad."" kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Orange County star Tamra Barneys husband files for divo...

So much for tradition. This week offers a couple of fine new movies--""Youth in Revolt"" an endearing coming-of-age comedy starring Michael Cera and a remarkable German-language drama by Michael Haneke plus a genre flick from a couple of brothers who thought that the last word about vampires hadnt been said. ENLARGE Michael Cera gets a touch from Portia Doubleday in Youth In Revolt. The Weinstein Company In one way only but a significant way Mr. Cera reminds me of Billie Holiday who achieved subtle marvels within a severely limited vocal range. His voice is breathy wistful and piping yet plaintive and emotive. His abstracted demeanor suggests an emotional range that is narrower still yet his inhibitions are translucent rather than opaque; directly behind them intelligence seethes and passion smolders. Its remarkable that such a singular young actor--hes only 21--should have found so many worthy vehicles (""Superbad"" ""Juno"" ""Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist"") in such a short time but hes done it again as Nick Twisp the hero of ""Youth in Revolt"" which was directed with impressive flair by Miguel Arteta and adapted by Gustin Nash from the novels by C.D. Payne. Nick has intelligence and passion to burn but nowhere to burn it. He lives with his divorced mother and her scruffy boyfriend loves classic foreign films uses elevated language to confide his yearnings to a journal feigns sophistication with charming haplessness (a casual reference to that craggy icon of American poetry Bobby Frost) and lusts after a Lolita-like apparition named Sheeni Saunders who is played delightfully by Portia Doubleday. Her boyfriend Sheeni says writes ""futurist percussive poetry"" and Nick agrees ""He certainly seems to have a gift for smashing ungraceful words together and deeming it a poem."" From the moment Sheeni appears in Nicks life the plot turns on his frantic efforts to follow her to the ends of California if not the earth and to obey her taunting injunction to be bad. To that end Nick invents a mustachioed Belmondo-cool alter ego Francois Dillinger who sometimes teeters on the edge of silliness. The movie teeters too but never loses its comic poise. Inevitably Mr. Ceras new film will be compared to ""Juno."" Both benefit from his sweet-spirited drollery both revel in rich vocabularies. (I cant resist quoting one more of Nicks deadpan lines ""Like John Muir I enter the forest with nothing but my journal and a sense of wonder."") The comparison isnt a fair one given ""Juno""s dramatic complexity and Ellen Pages virtuosity. ""Youth in Revolt"" is basically an absurdist ramble but a terrifically likable ramble with several stretches of lively farce (an incendiary accident a faux suicide a nocturnal flight from a private-school dorm); beguiling spurts of animation; an eclectic score (including a Sinatra soundalike Brigitte Bardot and Jo Stafford singing ""My Romance"") and a supporting cast that includes Jean Smart Mary Kay Place Zach Galifianakis Steve Buscemi Justin Long Fred Willard Ray Liotta M. Emmet Walsh Adhir Kalyan Ari Graynor and Erik Knudsen. One more thought. If youve been looking for a film whose hero uses the subjunctive frequently and correctly ""Youth in Revolt"" is it. The White Ribbon ""The White Ribbon"" a severe and eerily beautiful German-language drama by Michael Haneke takes place in a village in northern Germany in the early part of the 20th Century. The village still quasifeudal in its social structure suffers a bizarre succession of violent events and for a while the story functions as a whodunit. Who strung a tripwire that brought down the doctors galloping horse and injured the doctor? Who set fire to a barn killed a canary named Peepsie beat the barons young son tortured the midwifes retarded child? Once the real subject emerges it proves to be both ambiguous and profound What was done to those who did it and how did it make them do what they did? ENLARGE Leonard Proxauf as the pastors son in The White Ribbon. Sony Pictures Classics If that sounds fashionably vague--or simply obscure--be assured that Mr. Hanekes film is accessible though its pace is deliberate and its affect muted. (""The White Ribbon"" which was shot by Christian Berger is also a study in the power of black-and-white images.) The narrator looking back on his days as the villages young schoolteacher and choirmaster evokes a pitiless microcosm of German life where the milk of human kindness runs icy and thin. The doctor far from doing no harm inflicts unspeakable psychic violence on the midwife who has long been his mistress and knows the dark secrets of his domestic life. The pastor seeks to purify his own children with beatings then rewards them with white ribbons to signify their supposed purification. (A spontaneous act of kindness by the pastors youngest son elicits nothing more than a cool thank you; whatever his father may have felt goes unexpressed.) The baron casually tyrannizes his beautiful wife who finally refuses to live in surroundings ""that are dominated by malice envy apathy and brutality."" Only the teacher remains immune to the villages disease a lethal cycle of punishment and retribution; only the teacher grew up elsewhere. Through his generous inquiring spirit we come to realize the probable identities of the evildoers. Beyond that were brought to understand that their evil has its roots in the prevailing emotional climate of anger repression and displaced rage. The sins of the fathers are endlessly visited on the sons and daughters and its not for need of a dramatic parenthesis that the film ends with the outbreak of World War I. The villages disease Mr. Haneke tells us is the German disease and the human disease as well. Daybreakers ENLARGE Ethan Hawke and Willem Dafoe take up arms in Daybreakers. Lionsgate The vampire franchise didnt lack for attention or support last year but the German filmmaker brothers Michael and Peter Spierig have come up with a new twist in ""Daybreakers."" (The film produced in Australia is in English.) The year is 2019 and vampires have taken over the world--they offered us a chance to assimilate but we refused. As the newly dominant species vamps hunt down humans and farm them like dairy cows for their blood. But theres a catch--a blood supply that has dwindled to the vanishing point. (A panhandlers sign says ""Need blood."") If vampirism is to survive a blood substitute must be found. Thats a clever idea as far as it goes and a pretext for some stylish action (George Liddle did the elegantly noirish production design) accompanied by several solid performances Sam Neill as the CEO of a pharmaceutical giant Ethan Hawke as a vampire hematologist with a conflicted soul Willem Dafoe as an ex-vamp who has managed to be born again human. Still other performances are pretty dreary (I wont name names since you wouldnt recognize them anyway) and the idea goes only so far--roughly halfway through the 98-minute running time--in sustaining narrative clarity. ""Daybreakers"" finally comes up with some comments on the predatory practices of Big Pharma but thats an awful comedown from the blood-rushing brilliance of the early scenes. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD FOCUS The Good Girl (2002) ENLARGE Miguel Arteta directed this underappreciated piece of Americana from an original script by Mike White. Jennifer Aniston gives an austere impeccable performance as Justine Last an unhappy wife disconnected from herself and the dire consequences of her behavior. Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent too as Holden Worther an amorous adolescent who has taken the first name of J.D. Salingers young hero. (Holden is a stock boy in the discount store where Justine works as a clerk.) Every character is drawn sharply yet never uncharitably. The cast includes Tim Blake Nelson John C. Reilly Deborah Rush and Zooey Deschanel. Cache (2005) ENLARGE Michael Hanekes mysterious thriller which stars Juliet Binoche and Daniel Auteuil finds profundity beneath deceptive surfaces. This demanding quietly breathtaking film in French with English subtitles presents us with one surface after another--videotapes on flat-tube TVs ambiguous expressions on affectless faces--only to reveal that what we think weve been seeing isnt whats there. ""Cache"" is at once a series of puzzles a mystery that only seems to be solved halfway through and very much like ""The White Ribbon"" a human drama with much to say about the consequences of arrogance and repression. Let the Right One In (2008) ENLARGE It has only been 14 months since I reviewed this stunning Swedish movie about a teenage vampire but memories are short and the marketplace is cluttered. The vampire in the form of a dark-eyed girl named Eli moves into a suburban apartment with a stone-faced man who looks to be her father. At first Eli has evil eyes for Oskar the boy next door; he looks like an angel and lives in a hell created by school bullies. But she falls in love in her fashion and becomes the boys protector.

Paynes cult-fave book series brings little new to the coming-of-age comedy genre its hard not to be beguiled by Youth in Revolt.Cera toothpick thin his turtle-eyes blinking in fits of adolescent awkwardness plays Nick Twisp - the wry and brainy 16-year-old progeny of splitsville parents (Steve Buscemi Jean Smart). But the gawky deadpan Juno and Superbad star also gets to sidle into the role of Nicks slick sinister imaginary alter ego. This doppelganger who emerges like a pitchfork-wielding cartoon demon impels Nick to take a more proactive approach to life. His name is Francois. He has an accent he smokes he sports a mustache and tough-guy airs. All in all its a jaunty schtick - gleaned from old Jean-Paul Belmondo videos.And so Nick spending some summer weeks in a trailer camp in Ukiah Calif. meets the beautiful sophisticated Sheeni Saunders (newcomer Portia Doubleday). She can quote from Ozus Tokyo Story she has Serge Gainsbourg on vinyl and when she and Nick go to the lake and she hands him a tube of sunblock and the line ""Do you mind applying this to my exposed areas?"" - well you can practically see Cera melt.Of course there are obstacles in this potentially virginity-shedding relationship one of them being that Sheeni already has a boyfriend and that Nick has to go home to his mothers (and her deadbeat beau played by Zach Galifianakis).Enter the strong-willed man of action Francois. And enter a run of absurdist scenarios that include laying waste to a block of stores and cars a stealth invasion of an all-girls boarding school and a magic mushroom trip that ends with a naked Fred Willard (a nutty neighbor) blissfully communing with a living room rug.The writing (by Charlie Bartletts Gustin Nash and an uncredited Arteta and Cera) is dry and loopy and Cera most evidently relishes the Jekyll and Hyde business Master Nerd and Monsieur Rogue.Small but universally droll turns from the supporting cast - including Ray Liotta as a cop M. Emmet Walsh and Mary Kay Place as Sheenis parents and Adhir Kalyan and Ari Graynor as Nick and Sheenis respective sidekicks - provide unexpected goofball fun.Some tacky animated sequences notwithstanding Youth in Revolt is smart cool and frequently hysterical.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

"Youth in Revolt review Wearisome Michael Cera sinks teen romance |       NJ.com comments Youth in Revolt review Wearisome Michael Cera sinks teen romance Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on January 07 2010 at 512 PM updated January 07 2010 at 518 PM View/Post Comments WEINSTEINMichael Cera left and Portia Doubleday are shown in a scene from ""Youth in Revolt."" ""Youth in Revolt"" an early press release informed me was ""in the tradition of Catcher in the Rye."" Right. That is if Holden Caulfield were a teenage arsonist who burned down a chunk of Berkeley had a French alter-ego named Francois and liked to read sex manuals while tripping on magic mushrooms. Youth in Revolt (R) The Weinstein Company (90 min.) Directed by Miguel Arteta. With Michael Cera Steve Buscemi. Now playing in New Jersey. Stephen Whittys rating TWO STARS Ratings note The film contains sexual situations substance abuse strong language and nudity. Actually ""Youth in Revolt"" is a lot more like a hippie-era anti-establishment romance. Its high school anti-hero Nick Twisp (Michael Cera) wants to slip the leaden chains of authority man. Conformity is the only crime So he spray-paints someones trailer with a crude vulgarity sends someone elses car sailing into a river drugs an unsuspecting teen and lies to everyone he comes in contact with -- all in hopes of winning the heart of a stuck-up blonde named Sheeni (Portia Doubleday). What a romantic. Nick is the central character in a series of popular books by C.D. Payne and perhaps this all works better on the printed page where readers dont actually have to watch the character behave so rudely. (Or better before Cera rewrote much of the script.) Turned into surreal scenes and with arch dialogue though it just feels like a movie of a movie -- ""Juno"" maybe as told from the gangly boys point of view and spiced up with some abnormal psychology. It doesnt help that Nick who is supposed to be 16 is played by the mumbling and perpetually adolescent Cera once again wandering through scenes like a 10th-grader in search of the attendance office. Isnt it time this overexposed 21-year-old actor tried something else? A period drama? A slasher film? A year off? Tiresomely predictable hes become a one-trick pony with a bum leg begging to be put out of our misery. Director Miguel Arteta is a filmmaker with a sure touch for small discomforts. He previously gave us a proto-cougar Jennifer Aniston in ""The Good Girl"" and the queasy sexual melodrama of ""Chuck and Buck."" He knows how to keep an audience off-balance. And he does that well here. Theres a parade of inappropriate men through the bedroom of Mrs. Twisp (Jean Smart). One of them played by Ray Liotta even sticks around long enough to give Nick a whipping. Steve Buscemi is the sleazy Mr. Twisp; Fred Willard the single sunny spot in the film plays a neighbor a gloriously deluded 60s leftover. Unfortunately the films aims are at odds with its main character. It wants us to cheer on its rebel without a clue a hope it cheaply tries to ensure by making every adult around him a screeching monster. But Nick is nearly as dreadful as the people hes rebelling against and everyone sounds alike speaking the same deadpan Diablo Cody-fied dialogue. Theres definitely some visual style here (I could have used more of Artetas playful switching to stop-motion animation) and I appreciated the dark urge to do something more than just another teen comedy. But a smarter wiser film wouldnt settle for cheap shots and self-satisfaction. The reason a movie like ""The Graduate"" lasts is that as much as it takes the side of its hero it also takes a moment to show Mrs. Robinsons humanity -- and to question its own happy ending. But ""Youth in Revolt"" is not ""The Graduate"" and its certainly not ""Catcher in the Rye."" I think I know what Holden would think of it though. Hed think it was pretty phony. And then hed call up Phoebe and pull on his orange hunting cap and go out in search of something real. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Rushed into production to beat the threatened directors strike in May 2008 ""Youth in Revolt was made well before some of us started getting tired of watching Michael Cera play Michael Cera. Not that hes bad at it - no one plays him nearly as well. Its just that Cera doesnt seem to be able to do anything else and dorky passive-aggressive and adorable has turned into an awfully narrow niche. The actor is starting to seem like a multiplex virus tainting every movie hes in. When my daughters heard he was starring in an upcoming movie version of their favorite alt-comic ""Scott Pilgrim vs the World they clapped their heads and groaned Another project unnecessarily Cerafied.""Youth in Revolt at least lets him play two characters a prototypical teen dweeb and the dweebs malignant inner bad-boy. The former is Nick Twisp an Oakland 16-year-old with a life thats a litany of awful trashy mom (Jean Smart) moms beer-swilling con man boyfriend (Zach Galifianakis of ""The Hangover) uptight dad (Steve Buscemi) dads luscious bimbo girlfriend (Ari Graynor).The inner bad boy comes to life when Nick meets teenage trailer-park queen Sheeni Saunders (Portia Doubleday) and promptly falls head over heels. Sheeni is poised and a little cruel alternately tempting and taunting the hero until he dreams up an alter ego to handle the antisocial mischief she craves from him. The alter ego is named Francois chain-smokes and has a pencil-thin moustache. Cera drops his voice a half-octave to play him and clearly enjoys the chance to be a jerk; the scenes in which the two sides of Nick argue with each other are almost a debate on the persona of the actor playing him.The movies based on a popular series of books by C.D. Payne that are smarter funnier and more filthy-minded than youd expect. Screenwriter Gustin Nash and director Miguel Arteta (""Chuck and Buck ""The Good Girl) have ported Paynes acrid dialogue from page to screen and handed it to a cast that knows how to deadpan it back and forth. There are some good sharp surprising laughs in ""Youth in Revolt. So why does it feel so dreadfully familiar?For one thing because hundreds of movies from ""The Graduate all the way down to half of every years Sundance lineup have driven down to the crossroads of virginal and clever and the bald patches are starting to show. For another Sheeni is a nerds fantasy with no resemblance to any actual woman (the script lets her name-drop Yasujiro Ozu and Serge Gainsbourg and then having established her cool cred never bothers to raise her IQ again).And a little of Ceras minimalist bleat goes a long long way even with Francois providing off-key harmony. The funniest moments in ""Youth in Revolt come not from the star but from Smart weepily playing dumb or Ray Liotta as a short-tempered cop who becomes her new boyfriend or - wonder of wonders - Fred Willard as an aging lefty neighbor who in one exquisite scene is glimpsed face-down on the carpet in his underwear tranced out on shrooms.A little more of that madness might have made ""Youth as subversive as it thinks it is. Instead the movies a revolt in which no one gets hurt or challenged least of all the man-child at its center or the boychik playing him.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet As a nearly 500-page-long exploration of the insatiable sexual urges of a 14-year-old rife with explicit gay sex drug use cross-dressing and an overflowing oversized cast of zany supporting characters C.D. Paynes cult novel Youth In Revolt poses formidable obstacles for cinematic adaptation. So perhaps its no surprise that Miguel Artetas well-intentioned film version feels simultaneously overstuffed and undercooked. Its a manic sometimes lively sometimes lumpy mess with too many characters too many subplots and too much random wackiness that feels less like a proper adaptation than like a Cliffs Notes version that leaps from big moment to big moment while discarding everything between. In a challenging dual role Michael Cera toys with his adorably awkward man-child persona as a hormone-crazed teenager who uses his mastery of language to compensate for his fundamental powerlessness. Hes both the put-upon product of a broken home and in his sinister alter ego a suave mustachioed Frenchman oozing self-confidence and callous disregard for anything but his own desires. When Cera meets the similarly hyper-verbal Portia Doubleday he becomes obsessed with winning her at any cost even if that entails cross-dressing becoming willfully schizophrenic and constantly deceiving parents and other corrupt authority figures. Like last years Adventureland Youth In Revolt is being marketed cynically as a quasi-sequel to Superbad when its really a broad ambitious agreeably wordy social satire in the vein of Terry Southern or A Confederacy Of Dunces. Chuck amp; Buck and The Good Girl director Arteta opts for a deadpan unadorned style that undercuts the wackiness but whenever the films tone gets away from him Cera grounds the shenanigans with his fawn-like charm. Like its protagonist Youth In Revolt is a little too clever and a little too willfully verbose for its own good but its rare and a little wonderful to see a comedy about the sex lives of teenagers that suffers from an excess of ideas and ambition instead of a dearth.

"Youth in Revolt | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; youth-in-revolt ) Youth in Revolt (United States 2009) January 05 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli From the beginning its apparent that theres something ""off"" about Youth in Revolt. Its not that the film is fatally flawed but the tone is uneven the satire is blunt the comedy rarely generates more than feeble laughs and the lead character never comes fully to life. A shadow of the novel from which it has been adapted Youth in Revolt tries to be something more than disposable forgettable entertainment but doesnt quite succeed. In the end its really nothing more than a tepid teenage romantic comedy with a few quirks. Fans of C.D. Paynes Nick Twisp novels will probably be more disappointed than those who have never heard of Payne or read his writing. Nick Twisp (Michael Cera) is a sex-obsessed 16-year old (he has been aged by two years from the book) who views his virginity as a badge of shame but cant seem to find a girl to help fix the problem. That changes when he goes on a vacation to a Bible trailer park with his mother Estelle (Jean Smart) and her good-for-nothing boyfriend Jerry (Zach Galifianakis). There he meets Sheeni Saunders (Portia Doubleday) and its love at first sight at least for him. Sheeni likes him but not in the same obsessive way. In order to make this more than a summer fling Nick implements a complicated plot that will eventually pave the way for Sheeni to run away with him. With the help of his bad boy alter-ego Francois Nick commits several crimes goes on the run from the cops and assists in drugging Sheeni - all in the name of love. In the novel Nick has two alter-egos Francois and Carlotta. Although Francois makes numerous awkward appearances in the film Carlotta shows up only near the end and the explanation for her arrival is muddled. Director Michael Artetas determination of how to present Francois - as a distinctly separate individual from Nick - has its drawbacks. Not only does it marginalize Nick as a character but there are instances when it simply doesnt work. Theres nothing new about having an aspect of an individual represented as a hallucination (Battlestar Galactica did this all the time and Fight Club employed it to stupendous effect) but it is not handled seamlessly here. Francois appearances and disappearances are not well motivated; in fact they often seem arbitrary. It has been argued that playing both Nick and Francois offered Michael Cera the opportunity to show his range. Nick is Cera in his usual low-key likeable loser mode - a variation on the theme he employed for Superbad Juno and Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist. Francois is Cera trying to put a cocky spin on this image and not really succeeding. Francois is nothing more than a pale imitation of a juvenile delinquent. Maybe Cera has become so typecast as a nice nerd that this is as far as a director will let him go. As a teen rom-com Youth in Revolt works although the fact that the movie has largely reduced the story to this level may disturb those who love the books. Newcomer Portia Doubleday has the requisite skills to play the bubbly smart Sheeni. Her scenes with Cera especially early in the film generate the right amount of chemistry. Theres some ambiguity in their relationship during the midsection (when Nick comes to visit her at boarding school he brings her dog along and shes more delighted to see the animal than Nick) and the ending not only defies logic but feels forced and unnatural. Still the movie makes it clear that the romance between these two is what were supposed to be invested in so a different conclusion might have been less satisfying. The film is peppered with oddball characters that seem a little less odd than we suspect they should be. It would have been interesting to see David Lynchs take on these individuals. Theres Nicks divorced mother (Jean Smart) who stumbles from one bad relationship to another and his father (Steve Buscemi) whos living with a woman half his age. Theres the next-door neighbor (Fred Willard) who hides illegal immigrants in his basement. Sheenis mother (Mary Kay Place) and father (M. Emmett Walsh) are religious fanatics but her brother (Justin Long) is a mushroom eating stoner. Ray Liotta has a small part in a role with which he is intimately familiar - a bad cop. One senses that the unachieved intention behind Youth in Revolt was to craft a hip darkly comedic love story - something that takes us to a familiar place by a new road. Unfortunately a lot of the quirky elements come across as pointless the tone is disjointed and the comedy is rarely good for more than a half-hearted chuckle (although to be fair there is one really funny gag - involving a car and lake - late in the film). Youth in Revolt feels tired and Ceras inability to provide a memorable Francois neuters a central conceit. Artetas movie is a catalog of intriguing possibilities too few of which ultimately bear fruit.

Youth in Revolt Director Miguel Arteta. Cast Michael Cera Portia Doubleday Adhir Kalyan. Rating R for sexual content language and drug use. RELATED Teen movies Yes well sort of. But its mostly Cera as we always see him as the wide-eyed innocent of ""Arrested Development"" ""Juno"" ""Superbad"" and wherever else he shows up. Which is fine. Ceras good at it and Miguel Artetas film based on the novel by C.D. Payne is funny. And it does give Cera a chance to play at being a bad boy. But its just that - playing at it. To explain Nick Twisp (Cera) is a virgin and like so many teenage boys who fit that description looking to change his status. Artistic-minded a budding writer he lives at home with his mom (Jean Smart) a trashy sort who depends on child-support payments from her ex-husband (Steve Buscemi) as well as the favors of whatever boyfriend is staying in the house. As the movie starts its Jerry (Zach Galifianakis) but his sale of a bum car to a group of sailors necessitates a quick vacation. At the trailer-park community the family escapes to Nick meets Sheeni (Portia Doubleday) who has blond hair similar tastes a sassy-yet-flirty personality - and a boyfriend. When his family goes back home Nick is determined to get back to Sheeni. Hes not the first but perhaps the latest to observe that women seem to pick the bad boys over the good so he sets about to change his ways - and to get himself kicked out of his moms house. Thats where the ""different"" Cera comes in. Nick invents Francois Dillinger (Sheenis into all things French) an alter ego with a wispy mustache a smoking habit and a more-colorful vocabulary all of which accentuate his all-around badness. Francois leads Nick to do increasingly desperate things until indeed his mom and her latest boyfriend a cop named Lance (Ray Liotta satisfyingly low-rent) boot him. But his plan to reunite with Sheeni runs into various problems including but not limited to her being sent to a French boarding school downstate. The supporting cast is uniformly good particularly the always-reliable Fred Willard as a neighbor Justin Long as Sheenis drug-addled brother and especially Adhir Kalyan as Vijay Nicks friend who accompanies him on some of his (mis)adventures. But the film really relies on Cera and Doubleday. She has to make Sheeni appealing enough so that Nick would upend his life for her; he has to make Nick both resourceful and confused enough (read desperate to have sex) that hed be willing to do so. Good on both counts. Doubledays Sheeni is charming smart and pretty and has just that hint of knowing danger that drives teenage boys insane. And Cera? No one does this kind of thing better which is presumably why he keeps doing it. Francois is funny enough up to a point but Ceras sure portrayal of Nick is a much bigger part of what makes ""Youth in Revolt"" a rewarding film.

The go-to guy for funny-nerdy-cute hoodie roles after his memorable work in Superbad Juno and Nick amp; Norahs Infinite Playlist Cera stars as Nick Twisp a virginal but sexually inflamed maturely sardonic but immaturely squid-bodied teen with a crush on a girl named Sheeni Saunders (Portia Doubleday). Sheeni is a cool customer whose boyfriend is a smug poetry-writing Mr. Perfect in a country-club sweater (Jonathan B. Wright) and whose own fantasies of sexual sophistication involve marrying a Frenchman. So to win Sheenis love (and to impress her with his willingness to be bad the way she claims to like her men) Nick adopts the alter ego of a Gallic troublemaker Francois Dillinger. Its an understatement to call Francois with his tight Euro pants and dirty mustache a bad influence on the otherwise mild-mannered suburban American kid whose divorced self-involved parents have no time for their son. Lets just say that at one point Francois inspires Nick to torch half of Oakland. With a nod to The Parent Trap Cera plays both Nice Nick and Felonious Francois. But as with plans to torch half of Oakland timing is everything. And Youth in Revolt is late -- arriving not just at the tail end of the stars sell-by date for this particular kind of character but more importantly at the tail end of the intended audiences attention span for an inconsequential Sundance-y tale of sexual coming-of-age. Directed by the vivacious filmmaker Miguel Arteta (Chuck amp; Buck) the movie misses the dark hilarity and herky-jerky energy of C.D. Paynes 1993 young-adult novel on which its based; theres too little color amid all the mayhem. At the same time the outrageously explicit yet innocent sex talk stuck in the mouths of teen boys by screenwriter Gustin Nash (Charlie Bartlett) sounds unnatural even in ? an age of worldly-wise teen dialogue. There is also entirely too much dysfunctional-family whimsy and reliance on costume as a stand-in for character Francois wears snug French pants; Nicks slatternly mom (Jean Smart) dons cleavage-baring blouses. Truth is theres also too much ? Michael Cera. Which isnt the stars fault. I blame the movies bad timing and its delayed release. When Youth in Revolt was shot the uniquely funny young actor was barely out of his teens. This June he will be 22. Hoodie-dom precedes him. It also obliterates any independent understanding of Twisp. In contrast Doubleday an intriguing newcomer who simultaneously projects innocence and allure has an easier time claiming her turf as Sheeni. Paynes novel Youth in Revolt established Nick Twisp as one of literatures more vivid teen rebels. It also captured a vanished early-90s sensibility (and immortalized the eras computer components). Nicks world still reads fresh on the page. Not so Artetas Youth in Revolt. Like dudes wheres the revolution?

"Movie Review Cera turns rebel to get the girl in Youth in Revolt - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Revolt Movie Review Cera turns rebel to get the girl in Youth in RevoltMichael Cera plays a teen who is sure he wont get the girl... (BRUCE BIRMELIN )January 7 2010|By Roger Moore Orlando Sentinel Movie Critic ""Punk"" and ""rebel"" dont belong in the same sentence with "" Michael Cera."" But somehow they connect in the few-holds-barred teen comedy Youth in Revolt. Youth serves up our favorite sweet pushover (Juno Nick amp; Norahs Infinite Playlist) as Nick Twisp virginal twerp in love-lust with brazen confident Sheeni (Portia Doubleday). And we see Nicks alter ego ""Francois"" a mustachioed hoodlum and hipster the sort of guy who actually has a shot with a girl like Sheeni. Because literate and witty boys like Nick dont get the girl. Not usually anyway. He keeps a journal. He soft-sells his insults to his cougar-mom (Jean Smart) and whoever her latest beau is (Zach Galifaniakis Ray Liotta). Nick knows that Oakland is ""a city filled with women who have zero interest in me."" What he may not know is that his every gesture and high-voiced utterance screams ""sissy."" But a vacation in a rural trailer park meeting the fetching Sheeni could change that. ""Whats your name?"" ""Dillinger"" he lies. Shes the daughter of ""religious fanatics"" but sexy and savvy enough to recognize her powers over boys with a cruel willingness to use those powers on Nick. What she talks him into doing is why he needs a Francois in his psyche --""bold contemptuous of authority irresistible to women"" who stands up to his parents sets fires consumes psychedelic mushrooms and makes trouble. Equal parts inspired and irresponsible the new film from Miguel Arteta (director of the cult hit Chuck and Buck) turns C.D. Paynes books (script by Gustin Nash) into a hit-or-miss homage to that French classic of outlaw love Breathless. Arteta captures Sheenis inscrutable smile and Nicks clumsy obsession and the daft eccentrics (Fred Willard Justin Long) whose path Nick crosses. Yes its still a movie about another ""I am going to die a virgin"" teen. But Youth in Revolt is also about French books French singers and classic French films about being the smart boy who wants to win the heart of ""the mother of my future gifted children"" but not smart enough to not make every mistake doing it.

Paynes 1993 novel Youth in Revolt--which actually was three novels collected under one title and so the possibilities were endless given 500 pages of material to mine. In 1996 Fox filmed a pilot starring Chris Masterson as Nick Twisp the 14-year-old ""Im Single Lets Mingle"" T-shirt-sporting foreign-film-watching Frank Sinatra-listening Oakland-stuck virgin from Paynes book. Jane Kaczmarek played his haggard DMV-working mother. If that sounds familiar its only because both actors would ultimately wind up playing son and mother on Foxs Malcolm in the Middle. A bland sitcom that went unaired Youth in Revolt perished as did the next screenwriter hired to try again for MTV two years later.Now comes writer Gustin Nashs version. Nash--who penned Charlie Bartlett making him 0-for-2 in the revolting youth sweepstakes--has severed the jokes and hijinks from Paynes plain yet playful narrative with a dull ax. The surrealism and sensitivity of the novel which spawned a cult of collectors who trade the limited-run first edition for hundreds of dollars has been boiled down till it tastes like pungent tweener formula. Payne may have exaggerated horny teen angst into slapstick and mayhem (what teen doesnt do the same thing?) but he did so effortlessly earnestly. Nash and director Miguel Arteta try too hard; they want their movie branded a cult favorite before anyones even seen it.Winded and weary from its long journey to a bigger screen the three-books-in-one has been squeezed into a 90-minute Cliffs Notes version starring Michael Cera as Every Role Michael Ceras Ever Had. And so the curse of translating Youth in Revolt for moving pictures lives on--yet another didnt-get-it disaster this time with Nick Twisp as George Michael Bluth.Cera is at least allowed a few moments to break character when he assumes Nicks alter ego Francois Dillinger who sports a wispy mustache and tight white slacks and smokes nonstop--Jean-Paul Belmondo with homework. Hes the devil on Nicks shoulder who says what Nick doesnt to get the girl (Sheeni Saunders played by Portia Doubleday) and does what Nick cant (like stealing a car and a trailer precisely so he can get in trouble) and who is by far the most interesting character in a film lacking well character. During those few moments when Nick and Francois share the screen Ceras having a blast; Francois uses his calm and confidence to squash the squishy Nick.Alas Francois is little more than a cameo appearance and Nicks other persona from the book--Carlotta poor girl--is but a cheap disguise consisting briefly of a dress and a wig; oh how hilarious. Nick has likewise been stripped of his eccentricities his smarts his specialness. Now hes just another horny too-smart movie teen doing whatever he can to get laid in between woefully animated sequences surrounded by sketched-out weirdos among them Steve Buscemi as his creepy dad with the bimbo galpal Ray Liotta as a fascist cop in line to sleep with his mom (Jean Smart who already played this part in Garden State) and Erik Knudsen as Lefty so named because thats the direction in which his dick bends.The movie opens with Nick masturbating beneath his bed sheets after which he puts on a Francis Albert record and pines for a yesteryear he has never known. Hes trapped in suburbia with his worn-out mom and her no-account boyfriend Jerry (Zach Galifianakis in what amounts to a bit role) who has just swindled sailors by selling them his piece-o-crap car. Upon the sailors return the threesome decamp for a trailer park in Northern California where Nick meets Sheeni--the Jean Seberg to his Belmondo. But when Nick returns to Berkeley he breathless does what he can to get back to Ukiah and his Sheeni; thus begins a series of wacky misadventures. Its just a jarring jolt from one escapade to another (burning down half of Berkeley with a stolen car breaking into and escaping out of a girls prep-school dorm trying to ditch a car by sinking it in a shallow pond in front of a police station) interrupted by the needlessly crammed-in cartoons that serve solely as pointless non sequiturs (or more likely distractions).Arteta should have known better. The director of Chuck amp; Buck makes a valiant attempt in fleeting fits and starts to wring some truth and earnestness from Nashs screenplay; having directed one of Judd Apatows Freaks and Geeks more true-to-life teleplays he knows his way well enough round a high school hallway. But he is ultimately sabotaged by a screenplay that mistakes nasty for witty and clever for thoughtful. One suggestion Watch Greg Mottolas Adventureland.

An ""Arrested Development""-age Michael Cera would have been perfect for ""Youth in Revolt"" being the firsthand adventures of sex-obsessed 14-year-old Nick Twisp but sometimes the material is so right for an older star (like Dustin Hoffman in ""The Graduate"") you just have to accept the stretch. From ""Superbad"" to ""Juno"" Ceras certainly perfected his socially awkward virginity-averse adolescent shtick and while ""Youth"" doesnt echo the deeper themes of those pics Cera and his gifted comic co-stars elevate the mediocre source material into a semi-iconic coming-of-age story. Long-delayed Dimension release (set to open Jan. 15) looks promising though its R rating excludes the ideal teen aud. Adapted by Gustin Nash (whose ""Charlie Bartlett"" reflects a similar adolescent smart-aleck attitude from the opposite end of the economic spectrum) the arc of ""Youth in Revolt"" ages Twisp two years and encompasses the first three volumes in C.D. Paynes six-book series. The novels presented as Nicks journals document the characters oft-recurring erection and ideas on where hed like to stick it; indeed the pic opens with a masturbation session vigorous enough to establish the mindset of its libidinous protag. In Twisps world everyone seems to be having sex but him. The unfortunately named teen shares a house with his equally one-track-minded mother (Jean Smart) and her latest live-in boyfriend (Zach Galifianakis) while Twisps divorced dad (Steve Buscemi) dates women closer to his sons age than his own (his latest tart Lacey is played by ""Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist"" scene stealer Ari Graynor). But on a family trip to a trailer park in Ukiah Calif. Nick meets Sheeni Saunders (Portia Doubleday) an aloof non-virgin who shares his hipster tastes and condescending attitude toward adults. Like Charlie Bartlett Twisp affects the vocabulary of a more enlightened soul while his impetuous bad judgment belies his immaturity; Twisps best dialogue traces back to the books though some will surely accuse Nash of Diablo Cody-esque embellishment. When Twisp and Sheeni are separated he devises an elaborate regimen of rebellion thinking he can manipulate his mother into banishing him to Ukiah. Twisps partner in crime is Francois Dillinger the cigarette-smoking Jean-Paul Belmondo-inspired manifestation of his id (also played by Cera with the fetching additions of a pencil moustache and spine) whose suggestions lead him on a path of grand theft auto arson drug use and cross-dressing. Director Miguel Arteta is smart to play up Twisps outsider status (does any teen actually think he fits in?) before his actions spiral out of control giving auds an anchor amid the tsunami of transgressive behavior that follows. Through it all Twisp remains eminently relatable even admirably proactive in his pursuit of Sheeni and despite having popped his cherry in at least three previous films Cera still comes across as asexual enough to excuse the characters carnally motivated misdeeds. Seducing Sheeni may be his aim but theres something chivalrous about the lengths to which the lad will go to earn that right backed by Twisps quaint determination to marry the poor girl. Obstacles abound of course. MTV and Fox produced a ""Youth in Revolt"" pilot a decade earlier no doubt intending to spread Twisps many setbacks over a proper season but the show fell through. In this condensed form the plot feels episodic but not in a bad way with Arteta squeezing an impressive number of setpieces into 90 minutes. Well-placed animated sequences -- a mix of stop-motion and CGI -- keep things moving along at a perky clip. Whereas the book grows tedious with the constant interruptions of every-seven-seconds sexual thoughts the pic feels more innocent focusing instead on Paynes knack for unique detail and keenly observed human behavior. It doesnt hurt that Fred Willard Ray Liotta Justin Long and Mary Kay Place are on hand to help make the eccentric ensemble credible. Events transpire in a quasi-retro twilight zone where cell phones dont exist but Ashlee Simpson does and the kids watch movies on DVD and collect music on vinyl. Michigan doubles for the Golden State with production design and other departments supplying unobtrusive yet vital support throughout.
