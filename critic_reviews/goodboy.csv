The latest boy-and-his-dog fable ""Good Boy"" is passable kiddy fare that although it strenuously underscores its message of friendship and loyalty doesnt revitalize the genre. Tale of an extraterrestrial talking canine and a lonely boy features seamless visual effects and a few jokes that might amuse grown-ups but this item is strictly for younger folk. Hardly an ""Old Yeller"" or even a ""My Dog Skip"" ""Good Boy"" will have an OK if unspectacular theatrical run but fetch its real rewards in the home vid market. Twelve-year-old Owen Baker (Liam Aiken) longs for a dog. The child of parents (Molly Shannon Kevin Nealon) who regularly buy refurbish and sell homes Owen has moved so often that he has no friends. Having walked his neighbors dogs all summer Owen has finally earned the right to have his own pup. A trip to the animal shelter yields an encounter with a cagey border terrier whom Owen adopts and promptly names Hubble. Hubble turns out to have been a prescient moniker because the mutt (voiced by Matthew Broderick) has been sent from the pooch planet Sirius to research Earth canines. When an intergalactic accident renders Owen able to understand dog talk he learns dogs are superior beings sent to Earth thousands of years ago to dominate the planet. Once Hubble realizes that Earth dogs are in fact pets he warns that his leader the Greater Dane will be furious when she comes to Earth for a personal inspection. Worse yet if the hounds cannot reverse the balance of power the Greater Dane may insist on a ""global recall"" forcing all canines to go home. Once Owen and Hubble tell the neighborhood dogs of the imminent crisis pic hits its stride and unleashes its funniest material. Whereas Hubble insists that Earth dogs have to endure multiple indignities the pooches claim otherwise. Hubble for instance is appalled that humans regularly contaminate dogs water dishes (toilet bowls). But the hounds point out that humans serve a multitude of uses They are canines personal shoppers chefs and chauffeurs and even provide trips to the beauty salon (thats groomer to us). Moreover notes one pup dogs can defecate anywhere and certainly never have to clean up after humans. Meanwhile Owen has begun to confide in his neighbor Connie (Brittany Moldowan). Together with Hubble whos coming around they decide to outwit the Greater Dane by feigning canine dominance. But theyre dogged by a pair of bullies (Hunter Elliot Mikhael Speidel) whose attempt to abduct Hubble erupts in a chaotic chase involving the local dogs a can of laughing gas and a disastrous open house at the Bakers. The sequence culminates in an ill-timed visit from the Greater Dane herself (voiced by Vanessa Redgrave) who is to say the least not amused. Tyro helmer/scribe John Hoffman keeps the pacing brisk and the tone spirited always returning to the central relationship between Owen and Hubble. Well-executed CG work makes talking dogs easy to take for granted. In fact the elaborate pyrotechnics of ""Good Boy"" almost overwhelm the story making one yearn for the simpler days of say ""Lassie.""Human thesps with the exception of Aiken have the thankless job of making the dogs look good. But the four-legged crew for its part is well cast and expertly vocalized. As Hubble who looks as if he might have descended from the 70s movie mutt Benji Broderick evokes his trademark puppyish charm. Redgrave is suitably imposing and regal as the Greater Dane joining other vocalists including Delta Burke (as a primping poodle) Brittany Murphy (as a wiry greyhound) and Carl Reiner (as a drooling Bernese Mountain dog). Various tech elements including James Glennons lensing and Antonia Bardons costumes are beyond reproach. Production designer Jerry Waneks surrealistically beautiful houses and lawns actually in Vancouver double for an unnamed American locale.

"Good Boy Much Puppy Love washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Good Boy Much Puppy Love Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday October 10 2003 ON THE evening we put our beloved 16-year-old retriever to sleep last year our then-3-year-old son looked up at the darkening sky and observed that he thought he saw a ""cloud that looked like Mookie floating up to heaven."" (Right now in reaction to the preceding sentence readers across the city are having one of two possible reactions. Half are trying to avoid barfing up their breakfast. The rest are quietly sobbing into their coffee as they dab their eyes with the corner of this newspaper. To those impressionable dog lovers -- and you know who you are -- have I got a movie for you.) Based on the premise that dogs as we know them are descended from an ancient alien race that was originally meant to take over the planet but somehow got waylaid in its mission (possibly by one too many Milk Bones and scratches behind the ears) ""Good Boy"" works not because it features talking dogs (though it does thanks to Matthew Broderick and a handful of other actors not particularly known for their vocal talent) but because people wuv their widdle puppies. Its a simple but extremely effective formula. Present a cute boy (Liam Aiken) and his even cuter dog (the aforementioned Broderick playing the verbally advanced canine scout from another planet who has come to check up on his four-legged front line but is temporarily detained when he is taken in as a pet). Now take the dog away from the boy -- in this case because the dog planets supreme leader (Vanessa Redgrave as the ""Greater"" Dane) has decided that their mission has been an utter failure -- and step back and watch the waterworks flow. Its ""Old Yeller"" meets ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind."" I dont mean to be cynical about it either. I wasnt exactly dry-eyed myself when it looked like little Owen (Aiken) and his dog Hubble (as in the telescope get it?) were going to be apart forever thanks to the all-too-cozy relationships that have developed between masters (or mistresses) and mutts everywhere. The genial humor such as it is is largely of the excretory variety. At a recent Saturday morning screening frequent episodes of canine flatulence bowel evacuation and sniggering references to Uranus cockapoos and Shih Tzus made for the kind of laughs that can only come when you have a roomful of children watching dogs discuss their own poo-poo. And whats the harm really? Sure part of me wishes the voice talent (which includes Brittany Murphy Delta Burke Rob Reiner and Donald Faison) had a little more I dont know edge. And whose idea was it to cast Molly Shannon and Kevin Nealon playing Owens nerd-ball parents in the role of straight men? Still ""Good Boy"" isnt trying to be another ""Dr. Dolittle."" Heck it isnt even trying to be another ""Dogs and Cats."" When it comes right down to it the talking animal thing is sort of secondary to what is at heart just a simple but perfectly satisfying little story about a boy who wants to keep his dog.

"Good Boy A Match Made in Heavens washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Good Boy A Match Made in Heavens Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday October 10 2003 Has Junior been begging for a puppy? If so by no means take him to ""Good Boy"" a kids comedy that features an altogether irresistible cast of canine stars who sport eyes as brown and sweet as Milk Duds and emotional ranges that beat a few of their human counterparts in Hollywood. A live-action adaptation of a childrens book by Zeke Richardson ""Good Boy"" has all the elements that on paper make for a slick manipulative tired-out genre piece a lonely kid dogs who can talk and a Plan Canine From Outer Space involving an intergalactic invasion and potential doom. As overloaded as this all seems director John Robert Hoffman has orchestrated ""Good Boy"" with charm warm humor and even insight especially where casting is concerned. He has found a terrific leading boy in Liam Aiken who plays Owen Baker a kid whose only friends are the standard poodle boxer Italian greyhound and greater Swiss mountain dog he walks every day for his neighbors. His parents (Molly Shannon and Kevin Nealon) have promised him that if he proves he can be responsible in his dog-walking job he can adopt a pup of his own. When that day arrives it just so happens that a spacecraft crashes down nearby piloted by an adorable mutt from the planet Sirius (also known as the Dog Star). After the dog catcher imprisons the intergalactic stray Owen adopts him and names him Hubble but soon discovers that his new best friend isnt typical. Hes smart (when Owen instructs him to ""play dead"" Hubble staggers around on his hind legs then collapses in his best James Cagney imitation) he has a howl like a sci-fi sound effect and hes kind of a grouch. Owen gets to the bottom of things one night when Hubble runs away from the house; the boy follows him and discovers his dog with a transmitter which when it short-circuits enables the youngster to understand and speak fluent dog. As Hubble explains he was sent to Earth to ensure that it is being run by dogs that his brothers and sisters havent gone soft and allowed themselves to become -- horrors -- pets. ""It may look like people are in charge"" Shep the Swissie assures Hubble ""but face it you dont see us picking up their poop."" Soon enough Owen and Hubble are training the other dogs to behave as if theyre running things all in preparation for the arrival of Hubbles boss the Greater Dane. If they dont pass the test they could all be deported back to the home star for some Sirius reprogramming. For such a convoluted plot ""Good Boy"" is surprisingly nimble and fun to watch mostly thanks to the magnificent dogs Hoffman has found to portray his lead characters and thanks to the actors he cast as the animals voices. Matthew Broderick plays Hubble with prickly but not entirely unlikable gruffness; Donald Faison lends urban street cred to a boxer named Wilson; Brittany Murphy is appropriately breathless as Nelly the nervous little greyhound; Delta Burke is spot-on as Barbara Ann the Southern belle of a standard poodle; and what a great idea it was to cast Carl Reiner as the avuncular flatulent Shep. Perhaps that last bit is leaned on a bit too much in ""Good Dog"" but Hoffman also mines as much comedy as he can from the nonplused looks of the dogs when their owners speak to them in baby talk or pat them compulsively (""If one more person wipes their hands on me . . ."" Hubble warns grumpily). Hoffman and Richardson (who co-wrote the screenplay) turn anthropomorphism on itself a neat piece of conceptual jujitsu that will no doubt lead many viewers to look at their pets a bit differently. The cute dogs and crazy antics in ""Good Boy"" are enough to keep youngsters thoroughly entertained for its quick running time but with luck its more subtle messages about discipline and loyalty and mutual interspecies respect will last much longer. Good Boy (82 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for some mild crude humor.

I confess a certain weakness for movies about dogs even ones in which the animals through the magic of CGI speak to us. Hasnt everyone wondered what their pooch would say if bestowed the gift of gab? Liam Aiken is a shy 12-year-old who adopts Hubble and finds out theres much more to this pooch than meets the eye. Good Boy is a notch or two better than the silly Cats and Dogs. Its more reminiscent of the amusing and sentimental Homeward Bound in which each of the animals bore a distinct personality thanks to the actor voicing them. More about the movie Good Boy   1/2 Stars Liam Aiken Kevin Nealon Molly Shannon Voices Matthew Broderick Delta Burke Carl Reiner Brittany Murphy Vanessa Redgrave Cheech Marin Director John Hoffman Distributor MGM Rating PG for some mild crude humor Opens today nationwide Though its no My Dog Skip Good Boy does have a cute premise Scruffy terrier from another planet crash-lands on Earth and must complete his assigned mission to prove to his leader that dogs are ruling the world. The fate of mans best friend hangs in the balance. (Related item See a clip from Good Boy) The story hinges on Owen (Liam Aiken) a shy 12-year-old who has trouble making friends. It doesnt help that his parents (Kevin Nealon and Molly Shannon) are in the business of buying renovating and re-selling homes. Owen is about to move from his favorite house; he also will have to abandon his beloved neighborhood dog-walking job. His parents feeling a bit guilty promise him his own pup. At the dog pound he chooses a new arrival a friendly-looking border terrier. But the pooch which he christens Hubble has more on his mind than belly rubs and kibble. Apparently canines were sent long ago to colonize the planet but something went wrong. Hubble (known on his planet as Canid 3942) was sent to investigate and set things straight. Shortly after landing he realizes he must outwit the ruler of his universe the Greater Dane and prove that dogs actually do rule the Earth. Fortunately Owen through a convoluted chain of events has the power to communicate canine-style. He gets the lowdown on Hubbles mission and enlists the aid of all the dogs in the hood to save their species from the wrath of the stately Greater Dane (voiced winningly by Vanessa Redgrave). Mayhem ensues and the meanings of love and loyalty are discovered. Matthew Broderick gives voice to the lovable wise-cracking Hubble. The neighborhood pooches are an eclectic bunch. Carl Reiner does a nice job voicing old faithful Shep a Bernese mountain dog and Delta Burke is just what youd expect of a prissy standard poodle. Brittany Murphy may have found her true calling playing Nelly a nervous whispery voiced hypochondriac Italian greyhound. One of the funniest characters is seen only briefly the tiny and hairless but tough-talking Henchman the Greater Danes right-hand dog a Chinese crested who is voiced by Cheech Marin. No new ground is dug up in Good Boy but the story is well-paced sweet and lively filling a void for very young filmgoers.

Starring Liam Aiken Matthew Broderick and Molly Shannon. Directed by John Hoffman. (PG. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Good Boy"" is caught in a crosscurrent between its loony cynical premise and the filmmakers determination to make a cuddly childrens film about dogs. And so very soon the entire story short-circuits. A promising idea turns into nothing and were left with a painfully dull kids picture an ersatz ""Babe"" with dog mouths moving and celebrity voices coming out of them. Loved the idea though. In ""Good Boy"" dogs are highly evolved creatures that arrived from another planet thousands of years ago with the intention of taking over. But they gave in to sloth established friendly relations with humans and ended up as pets. This premise could easily have been taken in another direction. For example imagine if the worlds dogs were only pretending to be friends with us. Imagine if they were only acting jolly and dim-witted to lull us into a false sense of security. Imagine if they were just waiting for the signal from outer space to make their move. See the potential? This could have been Alfred Hitchcocks ""The Birds"" only with really big teeth -- a comedy a drama and a thriller rolled into one. Instead the movie rolls over and plays dead. A little terrier (voiced by Matthew Broderick) arrives by spaceship in a typical American suburb assigned to report on the progress of dogs on Earth. He is adopted by Owen (Liam Aiken) a boy who walks dogs for pocket money and so immediately the terrier has other dogs with whom to interact. In remarkably short time the outer-space dog is seduced by life on Earth and bonded to his human master. Hes even trying to fetch. What a pushover. ""Good Boy"" falls into the cliche of alien visitation movies in which love -- that unique human emotion -- makes aliens want to stay here. (Anyone who looks at human history and sees love as humanitys most defining characteristic isnt looking closely enough.) Once the terrier who is renamed Hubble decides that he likes his young master the movie abandons its chief source of humor and its potential for drama. We enter the land of maudlin -- will Hubble be able to stay on Earth? Huh? Please? -- and we dont escape until the end credits. The technical aspects of the film are flawless and kick the whole experience up a notch. The dogs mouth movements seem completely natural and theres no doubting that animals can talk. The dog-to-voice matches are excellent as well. The sincere forthright quality of Hubbles face is accentuated by the pure clarion insistent timbre of Brodericks voice. Brittany Murphy is comical and sweet as the voice of a tiny Italian greyhound and Delta Burke does nice work as an easily flustered standard poodle. Appropriately enough Vanessa Redgrave is the voice of ""the Greater Dane"" the leader of the dog universe.

As Good Boy spells out they traveled to Earth thousands of years ago from Sirius (the dog star) to colonize and rule the planet. But they and the earthlings got along so well that they decided to forget the ruling part. Now Canid 3942 an extraterrestrial border terrier with the voice of Matthew Broderick has come to see how things are going. He is understandably horrified when he learns that dogs have become pets. As childrens film premises go this is a cute one but the execution is a failure. As Owen the boy who adopts the terrier from the pound Liam Aiken does a nice job of conveying adolescent vulnerability and affection. And 3942 whom Owen names Hubble becomes a character who matters. But over all the film suffers from a singular lack of imagination. And energy. Attempts at humor include the ridicule of pet lovers who talk baby talk to animals; dogs falling asleep while trying to learn meditation; the comparison of canned dogged food to pAAC/tAA(c); that old standby flatulence; and breed-specific behavior. When Barbara Ann a froufrou standard poodle talks in Delta Burkes voice about how pretty she is young moviegoers are unlikely to find it any funnier than adults do. Good Boy reinforces breed stereotypes and poodles should sue. Humans receive more politically sensitive treatment. Owens best friend is a black girl; one neighborhood dog belongs to two gay men; and when Owen is surprised to learn that the Greater Dane (Vanessa Redgrave) the highest leader on Sirius is a she Hubble says Of course. (Dogs talk in this movie but only Owen can understand them.) The film which opens today nationwide does have its moments. Hubble/3942s detailed response to the command play dead is impressive. And the children in a preview audience laughed when Shep (Carl Reiner) the Bernese mountain dog got a Japanese paper lantern stuck on his head. Molly Shannon and Kevin Nealon Saturday Night Live alumni play Owens parents who make their living buying restoring and selling houses. They are unwittingly destroying their sons emotional health by moving constantly a problem that children can understand. The gentle celebration of human-and-dog relationships on the other hand will probably go over a lot of little heads. Good Boy is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some mild but crude and totally unnecessary double-entendres.
