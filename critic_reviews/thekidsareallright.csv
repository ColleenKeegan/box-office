The Kids Are All Right (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies The Kids Are All Right (R) The Kids Are All Right the third and most personal film from director Lisa Cholodenko takes a simple yet intriguing scenario and pushes it in unexpected directions. Annette Bening and Julianne Moore star as a lesbian couple with teenage children in The Kids Are All Right. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald7/21/2010 Editor rating 3 ``I love lesbians the restaurateur Paul (Mark Ruffalo) exclaims early on in The Kids Are All Right. Paul is a laid-back bachelor who grows vegetables juggles sexual affairs with ease and appears to have no interest in ever settling down. Then he learns the sperm he donated years ago as a college student resulted in two children now teenagers who want to get to know him -- without their lesbian mothers knowing. They find out soon enough though. Jules (Julianne Moore) and Nic (Annette Bening) took turns bearing Joni (Mia Wasikowska) 18 and preparing to leave for college and Laser (Josh Hutcherson) a 15-year-old jock with questionable taste in friends. Nic is the breadwinner -- shes an OB-GYN -- while Jules is still dabbling in potential business ventures (her latest a landscaping/gardening service). The clan lives happily in a comfortable upper-middle-class house in Southern California and their day-to-day routine has a pleasant ordinary quality -- a snapshot of a modern American family. But Pauls presence upsets the natural balance. Joni and Laser naturally want to spend time with him but they worry that their ``momses will feel slighted or hurt. Nic who tends to worry too much and drink too much frets about the kids curiosity (``Like were not enough or something? she asks Jules). In his awkward position Paul treads gently careful not to intrude where hes not wanted. His introduction to the family though has consequences that like the contents of Pandoras box cannot be withdrawn. The Kids Are All Right the third and most personal film from director Lisa Cholodenko (High Art Laurel Canyon) takes this simple yet intriguing scenario and pushes it in unexpected directions. Nics distaste for Paul with his shaggy hair and noisy motorcycle is immediate -- you can practically see her nostrils flare -- but Jules is more patient and receptive and she gradually becomes as curious about him as the kids are. Hair cropped short and eyes often set in a disapproving glare Bening has rarely been better. You understand Nics fear and frustration as Paul becomes a larger presence in her kids lives. She fears hes beginning to take over her family. Moores role is more emotionally complicated for reasons that cannot be divulged here but the actresses make such a convincing couple the distraction of straight actors in gay roles never once enters your mind the way it often does with other films. The prevailing tone of The Kids Are All Right is comedic. Theres a memorably funny sequence in which Laser turns the tables on his mothers who suspect him of being gay and instead asks them why they like to get off watching all-male pornos (Jules explanation is fascinating). But the story grows more dramatic as it unfolds culminating in a long dinner scene in which Nic makes a concerted effort to bond with Paul and instead makes a startling discovery. Cholodenko who wrote the script with Stuart Blumberg handles the shifting of moods and tones expertly. The movie captures the bonds and frustrations among family members so effortlessly the otherness of the scenario melts away. The Kids Are All Right runs into the dreaded third-act woes -- the story so fresh and engaging reaches a point at which theres no place left to go but into cliche -- but its emotional pull remains consistent to the end. The kids really are all right in The Kids Are All Right. Its parents who are all screwed up. Cast Julianne Moore Annette Bening Mark Ruffalo Mia Wasikowska Josh Hutcherson Eddie Hassell.

Focus Features Annette Bening Julianne Moore Josh Hutcherson Mia Wasikowska and Mark Ruffalo in Focus Features The Kids Are All Right (2010) Copyright Joni (Mia Wasikowska) and her younger brother Laser (Josh Hutcherson) live in an attractive upper-middle-class home with their parents -- one a doctor the other still searching for her niche. The doctor Nic (Annette Bening) can be a bit of a pill so its up to the searcher Jules (Julianne Moore) to take care of the nurturing. All in all its a happy family.But Laser is curious about the sperm donor who helped make it all possible. So when Joni turns 18 she reluctantly agrees to look the guy up. His name is Paul (Mark Ruffalo) he has an organic garden and restaurant and hes cool with just about everything. Its not long before Paul and Nic confront the fact that their personalities clash. But in Jules the easygoing gardener finds a kindred spirit -- someone whos on the same loopy wavelength. It only makes sense for him to hire her as a landscaper. Thats when the real trouble starts.Directed and co-written by Lisa Cholodenko (""Laurel Canyon"") ""The Kids Are All Right"" takes a refreshingly matter-of-fact approach to its characters sexuality. Far from being reduced to symbols of social change Jules and Nic are simply -- as Joni would say -- ""the moms."" Its the freewheeling Paul who truly shakes things up at a cost that some may find unfair. Bening who was impressive in the recent ""Mother and Child"" is at once brittle and brilliant as Nic. Moore deftly explores Jules comic confusion without underplaying her despair. And Ruffalo hasnt been this good since his breakthrough role in ""You Can Count On Me.""""The Kids Are All Right"" probably could have used a few more scenes to come to an even more satisfying conclusion. But its a terrific film anyway. Movies Showtimes amp; tickets Jul 23 2010 (...)

Pauls fecundity is a wonder. Where he scatters seed there is abundance.In The Kids Are All Right Lisa Cholodenkos sharp and seriously funny portrait of an American family Paul is about to learn that a little deposit he made at the sperm bank 18 years ago has yielded two strapping teenagers.Paul is the bio-dad of Joni (Mia Wasikowska) 18 and Laser (Josh Hutcherson) 15. His sperm impregnated each of their lesbian mothers Nic (Annette Bening) a driven gynecologist gave birth to Joni. Jules (Julianne Moore) an artistic type looking for a creative outlet bore Laser.Here are five gifted actors at the top of their games as five characters in search of what makes a family.Unbeknownst to ""the moms"" the somewhat rootless Laser persuades the grounded Joni to investigate the family tree. First they meet Paul affable hipster and overripe Peter Pan. Then they invite him to meet the women with whom he has such a consequential - and unrecognized - relationship.Paul the unstable particle introduced to this relatively stable environment triggers a chain reaction in the family he inadvertently helped create.What starts as Lasers identity crisis becomes the family identity crisis. Pauls presence exposes the fault lines in Nic and Jules marriage. While the moms worry that Paul might undermine their parental authority hes also able to influence ""the kids"" in positive ways too.Cholodenko is the keen-eyed social satirist who made High Art and Laurel Canyon movies about the lure of bohemia to traditional types. Kids though is the reverse a film about the lure of tradition to a bohemian. The twist That the family-values advocates are a lesbian couple and the outsider is the heterosexual entrepreneur.Paul is one of those free spirits who cant commit to dinner let alone a woman. But when he does come to a family meal with the kids and the moms he feels . . . connected in a way thats new for him.Cholodenko (who wrote the screenplay with Stuart Blumberg) is a filmmaker who without heroizing or vilifying tells multicharacter stories from multiple perspectives.As the story progresses each figure is the central character for a scene or two. While Cholodenko makes them all sympathetic shes not above slyly satirizing Nics politically correct jargon Jules habit of turning nouns into adjectives like ""trellis-y"" and Pauls all-purpose default ""cool.""The cumulative result is a movie diverse and bountiful as Pauls garden. Its sexy and smart rueful and hopeful and like its beautifully drawn characters one of a kind.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

By Peter Rainer Film critic July 9 2010 Save for later Saved Positioned somewhere between sitcom and piercing human drama ""The Kids Are All Right"" is both overtly familiar and cutting edge. A daughter is about to leave home for college throwing her family into disarray. Thats the familiar part. Whats cutting edge is that her parents are a lesbian couple and her biological father who enters the picture after she and her younger brother seek him out was the anonymous sperm donor to each of her two mothers.Director Lisa Cholodenko and her co-screenwriter Stuart Blumberg are pouring new wine into an old bottle but their point seems to be that the new wine isnt really all that new. Once you adjust to the offbeat dynamics the family complications in ""The Kids Are All Right"" are almost reassuringly recognizable. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? The parents are Nic (Annette Bening) a Los Angeles physician and Jules (Julianne Moore) a waywardly employed homebody who wants to work in landscape design. Eighteen-year-old Joni (Mia Wasikowska) and 15-year-old Laser (Josh Hutcherson) are the children. Unmarried Paul (Mark Ruffalo) is the randy restaurateur and organic farmer who gets the surprise news from them that hes a father twice over. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Ruffalo has had an uneven career since his breakthrough performance in ""You Can Count on Me"" but here as in that film hes in his element playing a character who is an amalgam of wily and lackadaisical. Paul has never really attached himself emotionally to anybody least of all to a woman and at first he regards his newfound offspring as curiosities. After their amiably tense (and well-written) introductory meeting all he can think to say is ""Keep in touch.""Nic and Jules are temperamental opposites and their response to Paul upon meeting him is equally polar. Brusque and forthright by nature Nic is immediately on her guard; Jules is much more sympathetic and Paul with his radar for female vulnerabilities senses this and makes a play for her. Her dazed guilt-ridden acquiescence greatly complicates an already complicated equation.Cholodenko and Blumberg have chosen to present Joni and Laser as essentially all-American kids complete with the usual adolescent all-American screw-ups. This is certainly preferable to the downcast way a more moralistic filmmaker might have chosen to portray them.Still Im not sure its significantly better to present this extended family as essentially an avant-garde variation on Ozzie and Harriet and company. Arguably the most potentially interesting aspect of the movie is how Joni and Laser come to terms not only with Paul but also with their two mothers and this is the part that is least successful. I think its because the filmmakers believe that the more recognizable this family is the less alienating they will seem to mainstream audiences. Its a political choice posing as an aesthetic one.Although he has competition from Jules and especially Nic Paul comes across as the designated baddie. Does Cholodenko take a particularly punitive view of him because he is the films most conventional - i.e. assertively heterosexual - character? Ruffalo does a great job of humanizing this oversexed superannuated hippie but in the end hes as bereft as Stella Dallas looking furtively in on her child through a locked window.With all this working against it ""The Kids Are All Right"" is still more than all right. Most familycentric American movies (and TV shows) are so earnest - so negligible - that by comparison this one at its best seems almost Shavian in its wit. Cholodenko understands that the family any family remains a primal source for drama that is both mirthful and maddening. Grade B+ (Rated R for sexual content language some teen drug and alcohol use.)

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Its said that great acting comes from agile reacting. So its no surprise then that Lisa Cholodenkos ""The Kids Are All Right"" has such vivid performances. After all the comic-tragicomic dramedy about two teenagers seeking out their sperm-donor dad and causing upheaval for their moms Jules and Nic has no shortage of sublime ridiculous and authentic opportunities to react to. Granted it cant hurt to have the nimble best from Julianne Moore Annette Bening and Mark Ruffalo as the adults who arent nearly as grounded as the kids. Youngsters Joni and Laser are beautifully played by Mia Wasikowska (""Alice in Wonderland"") and Josh Hutcherson (""Journey to the Center of the Earth""). tagfamily dramedy Still for exquisite reactions consider the phone call that restaurateur Paul receives from a sperm bank telling him that an 18-year-old he does not know has reached out to him. Fresh from his urban community farm the bearded bright-eyed hipster picks up the phone with relaxed authority. Hes got a lovely joint in L.A. for crying out loud. But once he gets the news lets just say the cocksure ease drains some around his gills. Or take the classically constructed bit of comedic misunderstanding in which Jules (Moore) and Nic (Bening) try to have a heart-to-heart with 15-year-old Laser while sitting in their kitchen. He thinks they are trying to grill him about Paul. Thoughtful parents that they are they are gingerly leading up to a different question altogether concerning Lasers iffy pal Clay. See? Plenty of occasions for characters to bumble embrace sit dumbfounded. ""The Kids Are All Right"" premiered to acclaim at Januarys Sundance Film Festival. Even with lesbian parents as its protagonists Cholodenkos third feature is her most mainstream -- and fun. Amend that Especially with Jules and Nic at its center the film is her most approachable. Cholodenko and cowriter Stuart Blumberg have crafted a loving work about family that will resonate as true for those who find their experience reflected on the big screen (minus the drama-inducing infidelity one hopes) and will be revelatory to others. The sperm-donor theme echoes the birth-parent quandaries that adoptive families face. Bening and Moore make Nic and Jules a believable and appealing couple with all the highs and dips long-standing commitment implies. In the romantic physics of opposites attracting Nic is the grounded one a doctor. And Bening is not afraid to let her be a pill. (""I see who the griller of the family is"" says Paul only half-jokingly at their first family get-together.) At the movies start Jules has just bought a beater of a truck for her nascent landscape-design biz. We get the sense that this is not the first of her bright-idea endeavors. When she agrees to tackle Pauls terraced garden it gets ""complicated"" to borrow the theme of another female-centered comedy about self family and infidelity. Jules even says at one very funny flustered moment long before things spin out of control that ""human sexuality is complicated."" Hutcherson is a revelation as Laser. An able kid actor in films that clearly didnt ask enough of him he rings true here. Wasikowska brings a lovely wavering to 18-year-old Joni. Bright and maybe a bit dutiful Joni spends time with two very different best friends quiet guy Jai (Kunal Sharma) and hormone-amped Sasha (scene-stealer Zosia Mamet). Another turn of note comes from Yaya DaCosta as Pauls sometime paramour. The films most incandescent reacting -- and directing -- comes at a dinner table. Isnt that the way in a family flick? The moms and kids are having a sweetness-and-light filled meal at Pauls house. Nic is trying and succeeding even to appreciate the charm Paul holds for her mate their kids. We wont say more. But Bening delivers the lovely the ecstatic the devastating with aid of Joni Mitchell. Blue indeed.

Theyve passed the point in their relationship where the momentum of romance and excitement is replaced by hard work and tenacity. They could be any couple; the fact that theyre both women is both irrelevant and radical in its irrelevance.A comedy of modern manners with the texture of a great short story The Kids Are All Right acts so blase about busting open our moviegoing expectations that we easily settle in and enjoy the ride - which is of course the point. Story comes before all else and our engagement allows the film to rewrite romantic comedy right under our noses without breaking a sweat.Nic (Annette Bening) is older and practical; Jules (Julianne Moore) is a little flaky. Together theyre raising a pair of teenagers Joni (Mia Wasikowska of Alice in Wonderland) and Laser (Josh Hutcherson) and the kids while indeed all right are determined to meet the sperm donor that helped conceive them both. One winces to think what an easy Hollywood comedy might do with such a premise. Thankfully writer-director Lisa Cholodenko doesnt do easy. She tells incisive stories about family dynamics opened up and knocked ajar and this one is far more developed than her last Laurel Canyon  which was no slouch. She cares for her characters enough to give them deep wrinkles even when they behave despicably and the Kids screenplay co-written with Stuart Blumberg doesnt resort to gimmickry for its laughs.The performances are finely measured. Benings Nic is protective of the status quo and a little icy. Moore can melt down with the best of them (her pharmacy rant in Magnolia rings in my ears to this day). But Nic and Jules arent bundles of traits; theyre fully realized dramatic creations.The stars get to work with another true pro here in Mark Ruffalo who has perfected the role of scraggly wandering free spirit in need of a safe harbor. This triangle is the sturdy frame of The Kids Are All Right; when the three actors share the screen the film becomes a master class of delivery timing and reaction. The kids Wasikowska and Hutcherson lend capable support.Cholodenko a Los Angeles native has a gift for showcasing her citys holdover bohemian personality. This is an L.A. of organic vegetable gardens nontraditional families and sunlit motorcycle rides down leafy canyons. Its also a city that makes it easy to embrace ones inner Peter Pan and never grow up. Ruffalos Paul with his vintage vinyl collection and rolling-stone lack of personal ties is one personification of eternal childhood. Joni and Laser the surprise new additions to his family are possibly the most mature characters in the film. Not that this stops their moms (or just ""moms"" as theyre collectively called) from fretting over what awaits them in the real world.The Kids Are All Right is the kind of modestly sized specialty movie often found on the prestigious fall-release docket. Its a blast of cool air to find it in the middle of summer where sizzle tends to take precedence over steak. Great films are great regardless of where they fall on the calendar.Director Lisa CholodenkoStarring Annette Bening Julianne Moore Mark Ruffalo Mia Wasikowska and Josh HutchersonRun time 104 minutesMPAA rating R (strong sexual content nudity language and some teen drug and alcohol use) editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

"Movie review We all can relate to The Kids Are All Right washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On The Kids Are All Right Movie review We all can relate to The Kids Are All Right Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 16 2010 ""The Kids Are All Right"" arrives as the perfect midsummer movie a comedy about a flawed-but-functional family that like ""Toy Story 3"" captures the drama of growth and separation in all its exhilaration and heartache. Anyone who has burst into tears while choosing a dorm room rug for a departing teenager will recognize the emotional zings and arrows that fly through a story that can turn on a dime between painful and funny. But just about everyone who has been a parent child or partner will find resonance in its bittersweet depiction of the joys and trials of lifelong intimacy. Eighteen-year-old Joni (Mia Wasikowska) and her little brother Laser (Josh Hutcherson) are pretty typical teens growing up in Southern California today Theyre good kids even if they roll their eyes at their overprotective mother. Actually make that mothers Joni and Laser have two moms one a briskly competent doctor named Nic (Annette Bening) the other a floaty dreamer named Jules (Julianne Moore). Jules and Nic are like many 21st-century parents enlightened open prone to hovering (""Youre windshield-wiping again Mom"" says one of the kids). Theyve clearly formed a close healthy family which makes it all the more disruptive when Laser curious about the anonymous donor whose sperm helped create him and his sister persuades Joni to find their biological father. Just another bio-dad melodrama you say? Not when the man in question is played by Mark Ruffalo who draws on every ounce of his considerable sex appeal to play Paul a mellow somewhat feckless restaurateur who can seduce just about everything he sets his sights on whether its a gorgeous waitress or a field full of fresh organic produce. A bedroom-eyed underachiever Pauls the last guy anyone would consider a threat but when Joni and Laser undertake to find out about him his presence shakes the family in ways no one could have expected. Written by Lisa Cholodenko (""High Art"" ""Laurel Canyon"") and Stuart Blumberg and directed by Cholodenko ""The Kids Are All Right"" unfolds with a loping loose-limbed ease that belies its sometimes forced setups. Its a movie of brief almost furtive pleasures meant to be comprehended at dog-whistle frequencies like Juless Elvis Costello and Antones T-shirts or the expression on Nics face when she says the name of a friend of Lasers the moms disapprove of. Cholodenko skillfully mines the complications of the story not for gags or punch lines but for moments of wry observational humor (theres a hilarious sequence in which Jules expounds on lesbian porn being ""inauthentic""). The performances are consistently terrific although between ""The Women"" the recent ""Mother and Child"" and now this Bening is in danger of being eternally typecast as the uptight brittle control freak. Within an ensemble of consummate pros Wasikowska shines as a young woman grappling with the push-and-pull of a lovingly enmeshed family and forging her own fragile identity. As Nic and Jules weather the tiny earthquakes of two teenagers growing up (with one Peter Pan along for the ride) ""The Kids Are All Right"" becomes an amusing occasionally piercing but ultimately forgiving portrait that should strike a warm familiar chord with everyone who has left home or is facing a rapidly emptying nest. Yes this ruefully funny movie is about a gay family but mostly families as laboratories of that elusive formula known as Loving While Letting Go. As Tolstoy said the happy ones are all alike and as ""The Kids Are All Right"" shows even the happiest ones take work.  R. At Landmarks Bethesda Row and Landmarks E Street Cinema.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Movies like ""The Kids Are All Right -- beautifully written impeccably played funny and randy and true -- dont come along very often. Its even better when they pop up in the middle of the summer silly season like an unexpected breeze. A comedy of boho-bourgeois manners Lisa Cholodenkos latest -- it belatedly follows 1998s ""High Art and 2002s ""Laurel Canyon -- is this close to a masterpiece and it skewers the aggressively sensitive parenting styles of West Coast couples (and cough certain Boston suburbs) with a fondness that refuses to let anyone off the hook. Think of it as ""Heather Has Two Helicopter Mommies.Heres the pitch Nic (Annette Bening) and Jules (Julianne Moore) live with their teenagers Joni (Mia Wasikowska) and Laser (Josh Hutcherson) in a trendy LA neighborhood. Actually the kids refer to their parents as a single entity The Momses. Nics a doctor and a perfectionist; the looser groovier Jules was almost an architect once and is now maybe sort of kind of thinking about landscape design. The children share an anonymous sperm-donor daddy and at 15 Laser is dying to know who it was. Joni 18 and fresh out of high school reluctantly makes the phone call. Enter Mark Ruffalo as Paul dude extraordinaire.What teenager wouldnt want an instant father like Paul? Hes hip he rides a motorcycle he owns a restaurant that he stocks with produce from his nearby garden. Hes a locavore -- you can almost hear the women passing out in the aisles at Whole Foods. And hes a 50-year-old child who has made a career of charmingly wiggling out of any and all commitments. The sudden appearance of two grown humans who share his DNA strikes Paul as well kind of a trip.The sudden appearance of Paul strikes Nic as just about the worst idea she has ever heard. Bening has rarely turned in a bad performance but I dont think Ive ever enjoyed her as much as I have here so richly observed is Nics tightly wound maternal freakout. You could have a fine time just watching ""The Kids Are All Right with the sound off entertained by Benings horrified facial expressions but then youd miss the gloriously embarrassing sequence in which Nic finally bonds with Paul over -- what else? -- Joni Mitchells ""Blue.And when was the last time Julianne Moore was allowed to have fun in a movie? Jules is the intuitive goofball of this pair -- she lopes about the house like a much-loved Irish setter -- and the appearance of Paul presents her with both a landscaping opportunity and a raging midlife crisis. Hes the freedom she had once and its irresistible. ""The Kids Are All Right is surprisingly raunchy in places but with a knowing comic edge Nic and Juless reliance on gay male porn to start their fires works as character commentary social anthropology and farce especially when they have to explain it to their mortified son. The various bedroom rumpuses here carry both pleasure and purpose though. Its refreshing to see good old-fashioned lustiness depicted onscreen even as sex (almost) never delivers the connection the characters need. Genders aside you know this couple; one of the more satisfying jokes in ""The Kids Are All Right is that good intentions and parental cluelessness are beyond sexual orientation. Nic and Jules have read all the books and theyve taken all the seminars; theyre overflowing with self-help buzzwords about their ""higher selves. Their children still lovingly regard them as idiots. No wonder Nic treats red wine as the one friend who never ever lets her down.Ruffalo manages to make Paul an adorable jerk but everything about the movie dances along that tightrope. Cholodenko and co-writer Stuart Blumberg have an ear for the ripe New Age double talk of aging boomers and a sharp eye for their characters most appalling blind spots. Jules would maintain shes the least racist person she knows. Luis (Joaquin Garrido) hired to help her make over Pauls backyard might say otherwise if he hadnt seen it all before.As the movie progresses all the characters go deeper into folly while insisting everythings cool; that includes Joni a beautiful bookish sylph who hasnt yet figured out the right way to rebel. Wasikowska who has appeared in HBOs ""In Treatment and was Alice in the recent ""Alice in Wonderland lets her character come into her own with impressively subtle force. She doesnt steal the movie from the grown-ups -- who could? -- but she does fly under the radar until its time for attention to be paid.""The Kids Are All Right has its flaws. Hutchersons Laser isnt given enough to do and its clear that while Cholodenko knows a lot about people teenage boys remain a mystery. The scripts turn toward seriousness in the last act is inevitable -- the characters have to grow up some time -- and a comedown from the giddy satiric heights of earlier scenes. But the very final moments are just right in their forgiveness and humanity and in the way they reassert family as simply the people who know you well enough to put up with you. The kids are all right this movie says; they watch us muddle through and then they try to do it just a little bit better.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

(Some writers use the word ""dramedy"" but to me for some reason ""dramedy"" just means a movie that isnt very good.) Annette Bening and Julianne Moore quite wonderfully play longtime spouses with two teenage kids and more-or-less contented lives disrupted when the kids contact the sperm donor (Mark Ruffalo never better and thats saying a lot) whos their laid-back biological father. Cholodenko has said that the idea for the film came from her own experiences starting a family with her partner and the film does have an irresistible real-life quality to it; you feel as if these are people you know. There are wonderfully funny moments in ""The Kids Are All Right"" and moments that break your heart -- such as Benings face upon learning that the love of her life has been unfaithful or young Mia Wasikowska bravely facing the first minutes of her life without her family. This movie has about as much chance of winning Best Picture as oh ""The Bounty Hunter"" -- which is to say none whatsoever -- but I think movies like this are why the category was expanded to ten to make room for those ""little"" hard-to-classify movies that nonetheless resonate with viewers. Total U.S. box office Just under 21 million Total Oscar nominations Four for best picture actress (Bening) supporting actor (Ruffalo) and original screenplay (Cholodenko and Stuart Blumberg). Best chances for a win This movie is really only a contender in one category best actress (though it just might be a dark horse for screenplay). Annette Bening is beloved in Hollywood is a four-time nominee whos never won and Hilary Swank (whos beaten her twice before) isnt in the mix this year. Then again Natalie Portman is and her ""Black Swan"" performance has been scooping up all the accolades. Benings role is far less showy but its a master class in the subtleties of film acting. I think she just might surprise. Odds of this movie creating some fabulous Oscar-night weirdness Well it was definitely weird that Julianne Moore wasnt nominated but that seemed more due to uncertainty between lead/supporting roles than to any shortcoming on Moores part. (Strange though isnt it that Hailee Steinfeld is nominated in supporting for a role much larger than Benings -- whos in lead?) Its a disappointment for Moore whos also never won an Oscar despite four nominations but shell have other chances. Ruffalo should he stage an upset and win supporting actor (pretty unlikely unless both Christian Bale and Geoffrey Rush get involved in some shocking scandal before the ballots are due) seems likely to give a charmingly weird acceptance speech but I doubt itll happen. Where Id rank this movie among the 10 Best Picture contenders 6 Based on the relatively low box-office Im guessing many of you havent seen this film. If you did did you like it?

In other words its a miracle. Imagine a boldly funny film that doesnt trade in meet-cutes and laugh-track jokes but carefully observes five interesting people colliding like bumper cars. Nic and Jules are a well-off suburban Southern California couple on the cusp of middle age. They have nice children 18-year-old Joni and her 15-year-old brother Laser. Their table talk is about doctor Nics medical practice drifty Jules latest stab at finding a vocation (this time as a landscape gardener maybe) Jonis preparations for college and Lasers summertime shenanigans. Theres a bit of angst around the edges but essentially its a nice Ozzie and Harriet household. Incidentally Nic and Jules are lesbians. Which brings us to Paul the sperm-donor father of both children. The kids want to bring him into their lives. The ""Moms"" as the kids collectively call them are reluctant but allow visits. The arrival of this rootless organic farmer/restaurateur disrupts the emotional ecosystem that took years to evolve. Paul a charming perpetual bachelor wandering through life like a tourist happily spends time with this prefab clan. ""I love lesbians"" he declares as if they were tasty legumes. The film is an unabashed love letter to the idea of family but it doesnt idealize the institution or the realistically flawed people in it. Dark notes accentuate the films ticklish humor. Their decades-long relationship has brought the Moms to that point in middle age when sex is routine. Each feels taxed and underappreciated. ""If it was up to you our kids wouldnt even send out thank-you notes"" prickly pear Nic snipes ""theyd just send out good vibes."" Its another solid performance by Annette Bening who like a fine chardonnay gets better with age served cold and refreshing. We get a sense of the anger that sweet henpecked Jules holds in check from Julianne Moores pained smile. The kids (Mia Wasikowska Josh Hutcherson) and Paul (Mark Ruffalo) bond like Krazy Glue. They blossom as he encourages their independence in ways two mothers cant. Nic and Jules dispense enough talk of feelings to glaze a child psychologists eyes; Paul is a self-proclaimed ""doer."" Nic who is not exactly man-positive raises her defensive shields against the outsider. Hippie-dippy Jules whose sexual center of gravity is as here-and-there as her career plans must confront her own confusion about the handsome lug now installed at the dinner table. His Peter Pan mentality is closer to her wavelength than Nics Type A drive and he made her family possible. Ruffalo lets us see the unstable mix of emotions bubbling beneath Pauls smooth delivery. Before long Jules is helping revive Pauls shaggy back garden spending hours in close consultation with her new client. Very close consultation. The film has some of the frankest and funniest love scenes ever to feature name movie stars. All this is observed with vivid scrutiny of behavior social manners sexual mores and psychology. There are no villains here no scapegoats for the chaos when Paul pulls the family constellation out of alignment. Director Lisa Cholodenko and co-writer Stuart Blumberg mold the story with sharp minds and skillful hands. They have created a gallery of living thinking feeling originals observing all with amused affection. Their mixed strengths and flaws nudge the viewer out of easy identification with any of them compelling instead a more mature deferred time-capsule-release sympathy. Eventually we realize that Nics desire to have a picture-perfect family is putting her under a lot of strain that Jules is uncertain whether shes using Paul as a lover or a distress signal and that Pauls lab-rat reaction to the presence of an available female is less liberating than he believes. THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT  out of 4 stars Rating R strong sexual content nudity language and some teen drug and alcohol use. Theater Uptown. I think this is what people are seeking when they go to movies by Nancy Meyers and Nora Ephron. Not a dull one-dimensional bundle of endless cheer but comedy with performances that are emotionally true. These characters -- and the excellent actors who play them -- are not utterly transparent. You dont know everything about them the first time you see them though they would insist that what you see is what you get (Pauls restaurant is named WYSIWYG). The film gently mocks their uber-empathetic posturing. Even they dont know what crazy counterintuitive reaction theyll have when theyre put to the test. Jules responds with self-righteous anger when she suspects that a Latino gardener is smirking about her tryst. Who knew she had such spite in her? The films greatest strength as the characters travel the rocky road to reconciliation is that they remain so appealing even as they do deplorable things.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 8 2010 615 PM The Kids Are All Right The movie weve been waiting for all year. By Dana Stevens After youve seen The Kids Are All Right check out our Spoiler Special discussion You can also download the program here or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed via iTunes or directly with our RSS feed. The Kids Are All Right Lisa Cholodenkos The Kids Are All Right (Focus Features) is the movie weve been waiting for all year a comedy that doesnt take cheap shots a drama that doesnt manipulate a movie of ideas that doesnt preach. Its a rich layered juicy film with quiet revelations punctuated by big laughs. And it leaves you feeling wistful for at least three reasons because of what happens in the story because the movies over and because there arent more of them this good. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Jules (Julianne Moore) and Nic (Annette Bening) are a middle-aged lesbian couple in Los Angeles with two teenage children Joni (Mia Wasikowska) and Laser (Josh Hutcherson). Nic a physician is the breadwinner of this stable well-off family while the unfocused Jules has vague plans to start a landscaping business on her partners dime. Near the start of the movie Joni at her younger brothers urging calls up the sperm bank that provided their mothers with genetic material 18 years ago. Behind their mothers backs the siblings make contact with their hitherto anonymous biological father Paul (Mark Ruffalo) a hedonistic restaurateur whos flattered by the attention but unsure how to proceed. Gradually Paul is incorporated into the fringes of the family The children bring him home for an excruciatingly awkward lunch and against Nics wishes Jules takes on the job of landscaping his yard. Its fitting that gardening--Jules landscaping project Pauls achingly trendy farm-to-table restaurant--plays such a large role in The Kids Are All Right because the movie is at heart about the ecosystem of a family and the way that system changes when an exotic species is introduced. The presence of Paul changes everything exposing fault lines in Nic and Jules relationship and forcing the children to defy their mothers and reassess their peer friendships. (A subplot in which the introverted Laser finally stands up to his jerky best friend is particularly well-handled.) In one of the movies funniest scenes Nic unleashes her hostility toward Paul in an icy diatribe about the organic-food fad ""If I hear one more person say how much they love heirloom tomatoes Im going to punch them right in the face."" Without ever making the comparison outright Cholodenko and her co-writer Stuart Blumberg draw a parallel between the aspiration for organic purity and the myth of the perfect family. However assiduously you cultivate your garden they suggest theres no predicting what might crop up by surprise or how itll grow. In a movie whose story hinges entirely on how the characters treat one other the acting here is really interacting and this stellar ensemble cast gets it exactly right. Bening makes Nic a force to be reckoned with an acid-tongued workaholic who loves her wine a little more than she should but whos such lively company you understand what Jules sees in her. A scene in which Nic sings Joni Mitchells ""All I Want"" a cappella at a dinner party veers from embarrassment to exaltation--and then back to embarrassment again. The ever-astounding Julianne Moore finds lots of layers in Jules passive-aggression vulnerability coquettish vanity sexual hunger. Ruffalo just Ruffaloes it up playing the kind of part thats been his subspecialty since You Can Count on Me the immature but well-meaning and rakishly sexy scamp. And as the kids who arent always but eventually will be all right Wasikowska and Hutcherson are tentative and tender and convincingly sibling-like. The scene in which the family drops the college-bound Joni off at her freshman dorm will wring tears even from the few audience members who made it dry-eyed through Toy Story 3. More than anything The Kids Are All Right is a film about marriage. Not about gay marriage in particular though the portrait of this couples decades-long bond underscores the absurdity of the debate about what to call same-sex unions. Cholodenko who has a donor child with her partner isnt making a rah-rah commercial for alternative families--in fact some gay viewers may bristle at the movies less-than-orthodox take on lesbian sexuality and the complications of donor parenthood. What Cholodenko has aimed for and achieved is something bigger a serious and funny film about the simple yet incomprehensibly fraught act of moving through time with the person you love.Like  Slate on Facebook.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Jul. 08 2010 258PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The Kids Are All Right Directed by Lisa Cholodenko Written by Lisa Cholodenko and Stuart Blumberg Starring Julianne Moore Annette Bening Mark Ruffalo Classification 18A Somewhere around the halfway mark the realization arrives with a dull thud Turns out that unconventional families can be just as tedious in their melodramatic dysfunctions as any traditional clan. And if thats the message Lisa Cholodenko means to impart in The Kids Are All Right give her full marks. She has succeeded in making interesting differences look boringly familiar. First the primary difference. Nic and Jules (Annette Bening and Julianne Moore) are a long-time lesbian couple with two teenage children between them one born to each mother from the same anonymous donor at the local sperm bank. Set generically in California the establishing scenes show them to be a happy and loving bunch with no more than the usual quota of familial tensions. A doctor and the main breadwinner Nic is a bit of a control freak while Jules has flirted with various careers but gone steady with none. Landscape gardening is her latest passion. As for the kids they are indeed all right. Joni (Mia Wasikowska) is an A-student soon heading off to college; her younger sibling Laser (Josh Hutcherson) is a good and good-hearted lad. Normal too after all the years is a certain fatigue in the parental bedroom although a stash of porn sometimes helps to kick-start the libido - in this case the gay male brand seems to do the trick. Chancing upon the stash Laser (okay that handle definitely strays from the norm) is puzzled by their choice but this is nothing if not a household that shares information - the ""Moms"" patiently explain to him the counter-intuitive workings of their sexual nature. Speaking of shared info its time for the premise to engage. In two of her earlier features ( High Art and Laurel Canyon) Cholodenko has shown a fondness for injecting potentially volatile strangers into the domestic mix. Ditto here when the teens decide to seek out their donor father and find him in the affable person of Paul (Mark Ruffalo). A successful restaurateur and a shaggy bachelor partial to serial relationships and fast motorbikes hes curious about his offspring yet careful not to overstep his bounds. Cue the awkward meetings first with the kids and then with the moms. You might have expected some tense sparks but no matters go swimmingly. Everyone likes Paul and Paul likes everyone. Oops then Jules starts liking Paul rather too much although their bouts of adulterous sex are mostly played for bawdy comedy. Unfortunately Cholodenko reserves the earnestness for the inevitable rows back home where the disputants tend to say things like ""Maybe it hasnt risen to the plane of consciousness for you yet"" or ""I know it will take you a while to process your feelings about this."" Actually no - dont mean to boast but I processed my feelings right quick even while juggling a succession of unsuppressed yawns. The only wonder here is that the actors are so uniformly strong - Ruffalo and Wasikowska especially - that they do their director the immense favour of elevating her dialogue to near-respectability. Cholodenko casts much better than she writes. Yet alas even a talented veteran like Moore cant sell a hoary line like ""Sometimes you hurt the ones you love the most."" Maybe if shed set it to music - nope sorry thats already been done. Admittedly the resolution is interesting mainly because of what it doesnt do. Most scripts tie up loose ends; some deliberately leave them dangling. Yet this sweeps the biggest loose end right out of the frame and under the carpet not only gone but apparently forgotten too. Then again when domestic melodrama turns tedious maybe thats a kindness to one and all.

The perils of lesbian parenthood include the sudden ap pearance of the childrens sperm donor in ""The Kids Are All Right"" Lisa Cholodenkos ruefully funny beautifully acted comedy of manners and unconventional celebration of gay marriage. Nic (Annette Bening) a workaholic obstetrician and her laid-back partner Jules (Julianne Moore) have raised an 18-year-old daughter named Joni -- after singer Joni Mitchell of course -- and 15-year-old son unfortunately named Laser. Their cozy life in Southern California is somewhat strained -- by Nics fondness for chardonnay and the feeling by Jules who has abandoned several stabs at a career that Nic doesnt appreciate her so much anymore. MORE JULIANNE MOORE CHATS WITH POPWRAP Joni (Mia Wasikowska Tim Burtons Alice) who is about to leave for college in a few days decides to help Laser (Josh Hutcherson) track down the man whose sperm was used by their mothers. That would be Paul (Mark Ruffalo) a hunky bearded womanizing restaurateur whos thrilled to learn hes a parent. Considerably less thrilled is Nic who bristles at the idea of this interloper offering parental advice even in a theoretical fashion. Jules though is far friendlier toward Paul especially after he hires her to landscape his barren backyard which she enthusiastically describes as ""fecund."" Its pretty clear that Nics frostiness -- and Pauls horniness -- will evolve into a D.H. Lawrence-style alternative to Jules alternative lifestyle. The script by Cholodenko and Stuart Blumberg is often hilarious -- especially when Nic and Jules are asked by their baffled son to explain why their preference in porn runs to the gay male variety. Laser has his own sexual identity issues -- hes hanging with an abusive male friend -- and Joni is wrestling with the idea of leaving home. These well-drawn characters are wonderfully portrayed by the five lead actors all of whom are given moments to shine -- especially when Nic launches into a frighteningly enthusiastic performance of Mitchells ""All I Want"" after a few too many drinks. ""The Kids Are All Right"" might not be as edgy as Cholodenkos past work -- ""High Art"" and ""Laurel Canyon"" -- but this more mainstream effort has lots of smarts lots of heart and an open mind.

These days there are as many answers to that question as there are families. Sure there is still the standard husband-and-wife-and-two-kids quartet. But that one size no longer fits all -- or reflects all. In ""The Kids Are All Right"" were introduced to a different stable two-parent two-kid household. Here the two parents happen to be lesbians. But as the title suggests everyones cool with that. Until the two teens decide to find their ""donor daddy"" -- and introduce some raucous chaos into what had been a pretty laid-back backyard-compost and vintage-Birkenstock household. ""The Kids Are All Right"" is co-written and directed by Lisa Cholodenko who really should be working more. Like Nicole Holofcener she makes movies (""High Art"" was the first and ""Laurel Canyon"" the neglected follow-up) that are sharply observed portraits of smart women navigating difficult relationships. Also like Holofcener she can be caustic and funny too -- especially when spurred on by collaborator Stuart Blumberg here. And although Cholodenko happens to be gay and raising a child with her partner that doesnt mean she preaches the party line. These two mommies are attractive and full of humor but also painfully oversensitive and prone to psychobabble (""I know you need to process this emotion""). And they have their own un-PC quirks like watching guy-on-guy porn to get in the mood (""Yeah its um counterintuitive""). As always Cholodenko is generous with her actors. As the older more conservative partner Annette Bening is once again sharp rushed irritated -- its as if she has always been the smartest person in the room and shes sick of it. As her more bohemian partner Julianne Moore is full of slightly skittish Diane Keaton-ish charm.Movie Review The Kids Are All Right (R) Focus (104 min.) Directed by Lisa Cholodenko. With Annette Bening Julianne Moore Mark Ruffalo Mia Wasikowska Josh Hutcherson. Now playing in New York. Ratings note The film contains graphic sexual content nudity strong language brief violence alcohol abuse and teen drug use. Stephen Whittys review THREE AND A HALF STARS The young actors are more hit and miss -- Josh Hutcherson barely registers as the unfortunately named Laser but Mia Wasikowska of ""Alice in Wonderland"" is lovely as Joni full of pallid vulnerability -- shes like Gwyneth Paltrow before she became a chilly Coldplayed icon. And Mark Ruffalo is typically sloppily warm as the unexpectant dad. The movie doesnt let him or its sometimes ridiculously privileged and self-involved mommies off the hook -- as the title suggests its not the children who need to grow up. But it watches them all with sympathy and style (as in a dinner scene -- a nod to Hitchcocks ""Blackmail""? -- in which the sound fades out and lets us focus on one womans thoughts). Its certainly possible that the unconventional makeup of this family will turn off one segment of the audience. Everyones sunny Southern Californian taken-for-granted privilege is bound to distress another (the film isnt liberated enough not to treat a hardworking Latino gardener pretty shabbily). But the specifics of the story only underlie its general and universal theme Marriages and families can be hard work -- and kind of worth it.

Photo Suzanne Tenner Focus Features Review The Kids Are All Right 1 / 3 Back to Gallery The Kids Are All Right Comedy-drama. Starring Annette Bening Julianne Moore and Mark Ruffalo. Directed by Lisa Cholodenko. (R. 104 minutes. At the Century 9 San Francisco.) One of the best scenes of any film this year takes place in ""The Kids Are All Right."" The setting is a small dinner party at which Annette Bening as a lesbian with a longtime partner (Julianne Moore) seems on the verge of some kind of breakdown. She is talking nonstop. She is being excessively ingratiating. Every word out of her mouth suddenly sounds strangely inauthentic and you wonder whats happening to her. Shes wondering too. The scene resonates so well because it presents with accuracy and subtlety something that weve all experienced but that is rarely depicted onscreen and even then almost never this well. Its the phenomenon of knowing something without knowing it - without even knowing what it is that you know. Though not consciously registering whats bothering her this woman is picking up on a dynamic in the room and with all her mental force and might - with every capacity she has for evasion and distraction - she is trying to keep that realization buried. ""The Kids Are All Right"" is a Lisa Cholodenko film and the scene is an example of the rich and psychologically truthful work that this director does without being flashy and calling attention to it. First she co-writes (with Stuart Blumberg) a scene full of tension imagination and truthful observation. Then she casts an actress (Bening) who can do anything and lets her realize all she can do. Finally she supports the actress with point-of-view shots and a careful use of sound that reinforces and conveys the characters internal hell. Cholodenko has made two previous features that have had an outsize influence despite their low budgets. Her first ""High Art"" redefined Ally Sheedy and put Radha Mitchell and Patricia Clarkson on the map. Her second ""Laurel Canyon"" provided Frances McDormand with her most important showcase since ""Fargo."" But ""The Kids Are All Right"" is a step up not just into bigger budgets and bigger stars but also into a more fully realized filmmaking. Like her other movies this one has vivid characters and strong performances and flows like a slice of life set in an appealing interesting world. But this one also has a good story and if youre paying attention a distinct point of view. Bening and Moore are Nic and Jules a lesbian couple with two kids. Each has a biological teenager within the family and the kids are genetic half siblings in that they each have the same father an anonymous sperm donor. Their family life - Cholodenko emphasizes this - is completely unexotic unglamorous and totally routine. And then daughter Joni (Mia Wasikowska) having turned 18 gets in touch with their bio-dad (Mark Ruffalo) and there begins a tale. The bio-dad is tolerant fun rides a motorcycle; hes a chef who specializes in healthy cuisine owns a restaurant and is altogether a more glamorous figure than the two ""Momses"" who are a bit older and more burdened with domestic responsibility. And so without meaning to his presence on the scene destabilizes family life. Or maybe indeed he does mean to sabotage this family only he doesnt know it hes operating according to unspoken motives from a sense of entitlement and from an unacknowledged belief that this isnt a real family anyway. Like the forces that activate the characters much of ""The Kids Are All Right"" is below the surface. Along the way its an entertaining series of incidents full of fun character turns and unexpected detail. (In one scene the women watch gay mens porn to get aroused - I never would have imagined.) But gradually a sense sets in that what were seeing in ""The Kids Are All Right"" stands for something bigger that this is archetypal very contemporary and in the gentlest way possible fiercely political. Its a movie about basic things about the meaning of family and the vulnerability of families with the suggestion that the ones most subject to bombardment are the families least protected by custom and tradition. They have to find their strength from within. -- Advisory Simulated sex and strong language.

Theyre the suburban California children of lesbian mothers and the brother Laser has decided to seek out the sperm donor who was instrumental in bringing them into the world. His sister Joni hesitates because she says ""that really could hurt Momss feelings."" Not Moms singular but Momss plural her blithely commonplace term for the pair of moms whove raised them to be normal American kids. The basic joke here and its a rich one is that the dynamics of gay marriages differ little from those of straight marriages. But that joke also serves as a catalyst for some startlingly beautiful considerations of age and youth family values and before and after everything else the value of family. ENLARGE From left Annette Bening Julianne Moore Josh Hutcherson Mia Wasikowska and Mark Ruffalo as a family with complications in ""The Kids Are All Right."" Focus Features The moms Nic and Jules are played to perfection by Annette Bening and Julianne Moore; Josh Hutcherson and Mia Wasikowska give a matched set of fine performances as their kids. Nic is older than Jules and an OB-GYN; shes the familys breadwinner. Jules is an L.A. work in progress a beautiful housewife whos been trying to find herself without straying too far from the house. Foreign-language films have subtitles; this film has subtexts that enhance every scene between the two women--unspoken anxieties insecurities vulnerabilities comical but corrosive hostilities. And if the language isnt literally foreign it constitutes a droll lexicon of current California-speak on such subjects as mulch composting heirloom tomatoes spiritual growth (Nic knows she hasnt been her highest self) and rabid adolescence. (""Spermsters a hottie"" a high-school classmate tells Joni.) The spermster in question is Paul the newly outed dad of Laser and Joni; hes played by Mark Ruffalo with an easy affability that covers great subtlety. A heedless kid when he sold his seed for artificial insemination 19 years ago Paul is now a successful restaurateur with an urban garden that provides fresh produce and prompts Nic to say earnestly ""Its so...indigenous."" This is more approval than she feels. Pauls sudden appearance in the bosom of her basically happy family represents an unwelcome surprise at best and a free-floating threat at worst. If the film has flaws they are minor ones A fraught friendship between Laser and a school buddy Clay seems like a sketch for another movie particularly because the relationship that emerges between Laser and Paul is so interesting and strong. The movies title carries echoes of Pete Townshends song but a Joni Mitchell song ""All I Want"" gives ""The Kids Are All Right"" a moment of pure magic. Thats when Nic singing it gleefully reveals not just a pop passion of her adolescence but vivid clues to who she has become. And at a time when a single magical moment is enough to make a movie exceptional this movie has several others. One of them also centers on Nic whose normally buoyant soul deflates visibly and anguishingly as the camera watches in a surreal semi- silence; its an immensely powerful piece of acting complemented by Ms. Cholodenkos astute direction. Another moment belongs to Ms. Wasikowska--a superb young actress--and its silent and fleeting nothing but Joni (who was named after the singer) alone in a room about to make a bed. Still another moment is a clear violation of a sound dramatic rule--show dont tell what the story is. But rules are swept away by Ms. Moores inspired performance when Jules stands up in front of the others toward the end to tell them what being a family means and what it demands. Gay marriage is a hot-button issue but ""The Kids Are All Right"" doesnt push buttons or advance an agenda. The film plays fair with love in its myriad forms and insists on the need for close and stable connections whatever the homes configuration may be; in that sense its almost conservative. The cast includes Yaya DaCosta as Tanya a stunning straight free-swinger whod be delighted to start a family; Zosia Mamet as Jonis sex-obsessed friend; and Joaquin Garrido as a sad-eyed ill-used Latino gardener. Igor Jadue-Lillo did the fine unfussy cinematography. Every good movie is a singular event; if it werent distinctive it wouldnt be good. Yet this summer has produced a fascinating trend thats starting to look like a genuine phenomenon--female American filmmakers using modest budgets and limited resources to turn out some of the best movies of the year. First it was Nicole Holofceners ""Please Give"" an urban celebration of empathy in flawlessly comic terms. Then came Debra Graniks ""Winters Bone"" an example of ethnography harnessed to a heart-stopping story with a fearless heroine. Now Ms. Cholodenko has joined the party with yet another terrific film that bears the indelible stamp of a woman and an American woman at that. ""Party"" may not be the right word though. Its starting to feel like a home-grown renaissance. The Girl Who Played With Fire ENLARGE Noomi Rapace as Stieg Larssons Lisbeth Salander in ""The Girl Who Played With Fire."" Music Box Films It has been only four months since the first of the ""Millennium Trilogy"" films burst upon us. These are the Swedish-language screen adaptations of the late Stieg Larssons remarkable crime novels starting with ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo."" Now the second film has arrived with a grittier sensibility thanks to a different set of filmmakers but with the same sensational star Noomi Rapace who continues to redefine our notions of a contemporary heroine. ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" which was directed by Daniel Alfredson from a screenplay by Jonas Frykberg doesnt have the nuances of its predecessor. Its more of a straight-ahead action saga although straight ahead is a better description of the hurtling pace than the convoluted plot which takes all sorts of twists and turns in the present while delving further into the tortured past of its heroine Lisbeth Salander. If youre resistant to extravagant melodrama or flat-out horror tropes you may find the film inferior to ""Dragon Tattoo."" For my own part I confess to enjoying the lurid stuff just as much as the dramatic intricacies that reflect the texture of the source. (At least some of the texture; whats decreasingly present in the screen adaptations is Mr. Larssons moral outrage at what he saw as modern societys pervasive corruption.) This time theres plenty of opportunity for lurid developments because Lisbeth suddenly accused of two murders is desperate to exonerate herself and shes up against some desperate characters. (One of them a brutal monster with bleached blond hair has a rare disease called congenital analgesia; he can feel no pain.) The shadowy connections between her various adversaries or torturers can be difficult to keep straight. Still everything makes sense apart from a few giddy leaps of logic and the commanding figure of Ms. Rapace always fills center stage. Just think of what shes asked to do--keep us constantly connected to a seethingly angry chain-smoking kick-boxing foul-mouthed bisexual Goth hacker with a history of violence that she frequently and ferociously updates. The actress gets immeasurable help from the writing Lisbeths anger is matched by her intelligence and her physical prowess which enables her to administer as well as absorb pain in megadoses. But none of it would register without Ms. Rapaces singular combination of eerie beauty and feral intensity. Shes a movie star unlike any other. Despicable Me ENLARGE Gru voiced by Steve Carell with some little minions in ""Despicable Me."" Universal/Everett Collection The inverted pyramid used to be a guiding principle of print journalists grab the readers attention by putting the best material at the top. ""Despicable Me"" (which involves the theft of a pyramid) inverts the principle. This animated feature from Universal Pictures is pretty thin at the top of the show but fills out as it goes along. And the animation is a grabber all the way through. Watch the trailer for the movie ""Despicable Me."" Video courtesy of Universal. The title--what a good one-- refers to the villainous hero Gru who does bad things for no good reason. (Well not quite. Like so many movie villains these days he could never get his mommys approval.) Gru may not have been responsible for the theft of the Great Pyramid; his much less interesting rival in global misconduct is a young comer named Vector. But he intends to steal the moon and that hints at the nature of the story. His so-called plan is such an arbitrary Saturday-morning-cartoonish notion that nothing of emotional consequence is at stake. Still Gru--voiced by Steve Carell by way of Bela Lugosi and looking like a fuller-faced relative of the food critic Anton Ego in ""Ratatouille""--is a funny guy. And he becomes a more interesting guy when he crosses paths with a trio of orphan girls who appoint him their father and melt his heart. The film was directed by Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud from a script by Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul. It looks so stylish that thinking about its plot is strictly optional. DVD Focus Laurel Canyon (2002) ENLARGE none Theres a nice time-warpy quality to Lisa Cholodenkos second feature. Everyone in it is transformed either by life in the Los Angeles canyon of the title where a hippie culture survives in modern dress or by encounters with unlikely love objects. I wasnt transformed but I was transfixed by Frances McDormands sensational performance as Jane a pansexual record producer who cant suppress a nervous giggle when she introduces her psychiatrist son Sam (Christian Bale) to a gaggle of indolent musicians living in her house. Kate Beckinsale is Alex Sams scholarly fiancee and Natascha McElhone plays a lissome Israeli. High Art (1998) ENLARGE none Ms. Cholodenkos debut feature is slow-paced but interesting especially for the quality of the acting. The heroine Syd (Radha Mitchell) is an assistant editor at a photography magazine. When she discovers that her upstairs neighbor is a once-famous photographer named Lucy Berliner (a startling performance by Ally Sheedy) the sweet-faced Syd promptly falls in love--not just with Lucys shots but with the shooter and with the heroin hell in which Lucy has willfully and quite hopelessly lost herself. Patricia Clarkson is druggy Greta a German with Dietrichs voice and Fassbinders name on her lips. Journey to the Center of the Earth (2008) ENLARGE none Josh Hutcherson has matured appealingly since he played a scientists young nephew in Eric Brevigs entertaining update of the Jules Verne classic. Brendan Fraser is the scientist searching Iceland for traces of his vulcanologist brother who may have gone down a volcanic tube. Anita Briem as a beautiful Icelandic guide reveals a bright spirit and a gift for comedy that will stand her in good stead on the Earths surface. The film was shot in 3-D with a prototype of the camera that James Cameron used in ""Avatar."" Like most recent 3-D attractions though its no worse when seen flat. --Joe Morgenstern Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

(Tenner/Everett) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday July 8 2010 400 AM Title The Kids Are All Right Sundance audiences are notorious for their optimism embracing mediocre indies that quickly flop in the real world. But occasionally festival fans get it exactly right shining the spotlight on small special films that need the extra boost. Last years recipient of those well-earned accolades was ""Precious."" This year its Lisa Cholodenkos ""The Kids Are All Right.""The story of a family that is both as unique and as ordinary as any other ""Kids"" may sound like typically quirky arthouse fare. But this is a movie for everyone - and in one way or another about everyone too.It really doesnt matter if you have two mothers like California teens Joni (Mia Wasikowska) and Laser (Josh Hutcherson). Or if youre an affluent mildly new-age lesbian like their moms Jules (Julianne Moore) and Nic (Annette Bening). What youll recognize most about this clan is how they relate to each other in each beautiful comical and painfully familiar way.Granted their immediate issues are somewhat unconventional. When Joni and Laser decide to find their moms sperm donor they meet Paul (Mark Ruffalo) an easygoing happily single restaurateur. Much to his surprise he likes the idea of being a dad. But adding a new member to a tightly knit family turns out to be well just as complicated as you might expect.Its such a pleasure to watch actors and filmmakers working at the very top of their game you may be shocked to realize how rare an experience that actually is. Even gifted performers like Bening and Moore can overplay when poorly directed but Cholodenko (""High Art"" ""Laurel Canyon"") guides her perfectly meshed cast with the gentlest hand allowing each to delve fully into the wise open-hearted script she wrote with Stuart Blumberg.Every scene has its highlights from amusing observations about sex to poignant truths about parenting and partnerships. But what youll remember most is the exquisitely lovely final scene in which Cholodenko reminds us that all we need is a single moment of perfection -in a family or even in a film - to believe that somehow things will always be all right.

This gem features five topnotch multidimensional performances in one of this summers most engaging films. Director/co-writer Lisa Cholodenko gracefully weaves unabashed honesty into this tale of a modern family riding out unsettling changes fueled by individual searches for identity. VIDEO Watch the trailer Annette Bening and Julianne Moore play Nic and Jules a lesbian couple comfortably raising their two teenage children. The familys lives are upended when 15-year-old Laser (Josh Hutcherson) and his 18-year-old sister Joni (Mia Wasikowska named after Nics favorite singer Joni Mitchell) track down the anonymous sperm donor partly responsible for their existence. Fascinated by the charismatic Paul (Mark Ruffalo) an organic restaurateur the kids warm to the man they refer to as ""our donor dad."" Everything about this film rings true from the dialogue to the California homes and evocative musical score. At times it feels like a companion piece to Please Give another witty and well-observed slice of modern family life. And like Toy Story 3 it features the emotionally charged process of a child preparing to leave for college. What makes this story so effective is not that it strives to be relevant in its depiction of a gay couple raising children but that it captures real-life rhythms and sincere concerns -- both everyday and existential -- experienced by families of all kinds. Theirs may be an unconventional family but the quandaries and problems are the same as in most families. Cholodenko captures the quotidian ups and downs of relationships and the heightened emotions and curiosity that rule the teen years. Bening gives an Oscar-caliber performance as a strong-willed though emotionally vulnerable workaholic doctor suspicious of the laid-back Paul. Moore is excellent as her landscape designer partner more open-minded and temperamentally less inclined to reflection. Two of the best actresses of their generation they make even a contrived porn gag feel like plausible situational humor. Ruffalo shows his depth in a pitch-perfect performance of a freewheeling guy who seems like an older brother of the rootless fellow he played so captivatingly a decade ago in You Can Count On Me. Pauls a handsome charmer and somewhat of an overgrown kid. His father and child reunion leaves the family reeling. Hutcherson (Journey to the Center of the Earth) and Wasikowska (Alice in Wonderland) are terrific and thoroughly believable as sensitive well-adjusted teens. The Kids Are All Right is probing poignant and above all highly entertaining. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Standards Editor Brent Jones.

"The Kids Are All Right When naughty gets knotty | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Kids Are All Right When naughty gets knottyAwkwardness is guaranteed when two hip lesbians have to come to terms with an unwanted sperm donor and a sudden rush of conservative values.Annette Bening left and Julianne Moore star as lesbian moms to two teens in The Kids are All Right.  (SUZANNE TENNER / AP)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. July 8 2010The Kids Are All Right (out of 4)Starring Annette Bening Julianne Moore Mark Ruffalo and Mia Wasikowska. Directed by Lisa Cholodenko. At the Varsity. 18AYou might well ask as a curious son asks one of his two mothers in Lisa Cholodenkos The Kids Are All Right why two lesbians would consider gay male porn a turn-on.Or maybe its completely obvious to you. But then how would you answer the question posed by son Laser (Josh Hutcherson) to mom Jules (Julianne Moore) after he discovers his mothers secret stash of naughty boy DVDs?Article Continued BelowAwkwardness is guaranteed no matter how hip you think you are. Which is why Jules so carefully words her response to the inquisitive Laser bright beam of a lad that he is. She tells him that human sexuality is well complex.Jules might just as well have said that humans are complex full stop no matter whether youre gay or straight. Thats the comic energy of this perceptive film which Cholodenko co-wrote with Stuart Blumberg and which plays as an amusing addition to High Art and Laurel Canyon her previous takes on L.A. foibles.Its a sweet comedy about a groovy urban class you might call the affluent alternative people who are found in abundance in California. They want to live close to the land and save the Earth but still like to drive nice cars savor fine red wine and bed down in high thread-count sheets. They also reject traditional family arrangements which leads to unforeseen problems when conservative values suddenly rush in. Jules is married to Nic (Annette Bening) a strict doctor who brings home the hormone-free bacon. Nics high income allows Jules who likes to garden to be more of a free spirit which is another way of saying unemployed. Nic resents this more than she lets on. But Jules has her own issues she doesnt like Nics judgmental nature and caustic tongue and she worries that her spouse enjoys wine just a little too much.Jules and Nic are the mothers of not just 15-year-old Laser but also 18-year-old Joni (Mia Wasikowska) who is named for Joni Mitchell and heading to college in the fall. What the two kids have in common besides their two ""momses"" is a single biological father or rather a sperm donor. Hes a man theyve never met and werent supposed to. But curiosity got the better of them and now everyone has to figure out what to do about Paul (Mark Ruffalo) an organic farmer and restaurant owner who has suddenly entered their lives. (And here you thought the romantic triangle of last winters Its Complicated was the height of modern family knottiness.)Ruffalo is great as Paul one of the best characters hes played since he first rose to prominence a decade ago with You Can Count On Me. Paul considers himself a benevolent rebel a laid-back lover who just wants to hug the world and to bed any willing woman. His reason for donating sperm 20 or so years ago? ""It seemed like a lot more fun than donating blood.""Pauls restaurant is wryly called ""WYSIWYG"" which means What You See Is What You Get. But Paul cant understand how smug and selfish he appears to someone as uptight as Nic. He is aware of the affect he has on Jules who is intrigued by how she can see her childrens expressions in Pauls scruffy visage.Everybody is trying so hard to be liberated but thats hard to do when people start crossing boundaries that werent very well defined to begin with. New Age thinking can quickly turn to Old School emoting when the clothes -- and the gloves -- begin to come off.The best thing about the film is its bigheartedness. Its not out to mock these people but rather to show how any person of any orientation can become unraveled when high-minded principles meet with base human instincts. Marriage and parenthood are never easy no matter how untraditional and unstructured the approach to them may be.And what about those kids? Laser and Joni are as confused as their ""momses"" but thats only natural and theyll get over it. Maybe theyll even teach something to Jules Nic and Paul. Life is like that even when the lifestyle is alternative.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The Kids Are All Right is the story of a marriage whether its a legally recognized one or not. The spouses live amid the comforts compromises and long-recognized shortcomings of a decades-long partnership as they raise two teenagers. They alternately work well together exhaust each others patience contradict each other drive each other away and unite for the greater good. The fact that theyre both women (Annette Bening and Julianne Moore) is neither beside the point nor the whole of it. Working with co-writer Stuart Blumberg writer-director Lisa Cholodenko (High Art Laurel Canyon) has created an intimate funny occasionally upsetting depiction of a loving family that is like so many families often only just functional. Bening plays a doctor and the familys primary breadwinner a flinty demanding woman who loses her ability to censor herself after two glasses of wine. Shes come to specialize in suggesting vulnerability beneath a hard surface and that skill rescues the character from villainy as she nags her children--believably realized by Mia Wasikowska and Josh Hutcherson--and neglects Moore whos put her professional ambition on hold for decades though her passiveness has limits. Theyre stumbling by as Wasikowska prepares to leave for college but what passes for order in their house gets upset when the children contact the sperm donor used to father them. A successful free-spirited restaurateur played by Mark Ruffalo--first seen shouldering a basket of vegetables and looking like the embodiment of virility--hes asked whether hes interested in meeting his genetic offspring and quickly answers yes. When he meets them he begins to recognize a piece missing from his own life. From there an already-complicated situation grows more complicated still. As Ruffalo gets to know the kids and their mothers dynamics shift new alliances form and neither Cholodenko nor the cast pull back from capturing the situation in all its tender awkwardness. Every scene looks like the result of years of accumulation be it the affections and resentments that have piled up between Bening and Moores characters or the clutter of their suburban L.A. home. Cholodenkos casually observant style perfectly matches the casts thoughtful work though the film ultimately proves more successful at creating messy situations than trying to resolve them The final act finds character after character saying out loud what theyve been expressing without words for much of the film. Thats a small failure amid tremendous successes however and one that arrives on the heels of beautifully realized scenes like a long Joni Mitchell-inspired dinner-conversation-turned-sing-along. In moments like these the film almost seems to melt away as we observe lives being lived before our eyes with neither the hurt nor the beauty filtered out.

"Movie review The Kids Are All Right - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-KidsMovie review The Kids Are All RightAn exceptional drama about what it means to be family with outstanding performances from Annette Bening Julianne Moore and Mark Ruffalo.July 08 2010|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic From left Annette Bening Julianne Moore Josh Hutcherson Mia Wasikowska... (Suzanne Tenner / Focus Features )Witty urbane and thoroughly entertaining ""The Kids Are All Right"" is an ode to the virtues of family in this case a surprisingly conventional one even with its two moms two kids and one sperm donor. Whatever your politics between peerless performances lyrical direction and an adventurous script this is the sort of pleasingly grown-up fare all too rare in the mainstream daze of this very dry summer. Before delving into the layered perfection of Annette Bening Julianne Moore and Mark Ruffalo lets start by getting past any hesitations or reservations about the lesbian household premise on which ""The Kids Are All Right"" is based. The issue of gay marriage is not whats on the table here. At its heart this is a movie about how families whatever their composition stay together love each other through difficult times and weather the particularly storm-tossed seas that come when the kids hit their teenage years. (Why the 2s are considered terrible instead of the teens Ill never understand). Writer-director Lisa Cholodenko and co-writer Stuart Blumberg have put the politics aside for now and created an easy interplay of comedy and drama spawned by typical family pressures a the thank you notes that havent been sent the sketchy best friend the parents dont approve of the house rules made to be broken. It helps that the characters are eminently relatable at the same time intriguingly iconoclastic no small feat. For those who are wondering there is some sheet tangling sweaty sex but its mostly of the hetero variety courtesy of the very appealing Ruffalo. The laughter and the tears are set in motion when 15-year-old Laser ( Josh Hutcherson) presses his 18-year-old sister Joni (an excellent Mia Wasikowska) to use her new legal standing to find out who their bio-dad is. While curiosity does not quite kill the cat it definitely upends this seemingly settled family headed by Benings Nic a doctor and by-the-book breadwinner and Moores Jules the easy-going stay-at-home half. As for the kids Jonis an honors student headed to college in the fall and Lasers the star athlete trying to figure out his emerging self so definitely theyre all right but change is in the air. Enter Ruffalos Paul a PC-liberal dreamboat of a donor dad who spends his days tending the organic vegetable garden that supplies his hipster-chic restaurant at night. He also comes with a self-deprecatingly smug charm about his college dropout success farm-to-table lifestyle and unencumbered bachelorhood. By the time Nic finally breaks in the face of all that eco-goodness dissolving into an anti-composting rant its hard to suppress the desire to cheer. With all the players in place the filmmakers set about deconstructing life as the family knows it with Paul their weapon of mass deconstruction. Everything about him is seductive with the kids falling hard for their newly acquired father-figure followed in short order by Jules and even a very resistant Nic. But then the lovable incorrigible is Ruffalos sweet spot and his performance here if possible is even more refined than his breakout in another intimate family drama ""You Can Count on Me."" At first Paul represents endless possibility the cool parent whom kids fantasize about the unexpected lover who believes in you and your dreams the latecomer who turns out to be the life of the party even as his very presence is redefining the family. But in filmmaker Cholodenkos increasingly sure hands life is neither easy nor neat and tidy. As she has done in her previous work ""High Art"" and the incisive ""Laurel Canyon"" she cuts to the bone of human emotions with the humans themselves fraying around the edges. In ""The Kids Are All Right"" its hard to tell who is fraying faster Nic or Jules. They are a typical long-coupled couple focused on the routine of daily life and forgetful of the romance that brought them together. At home as well as at work Benings Nic is scalpel sharp. Tension radiates around her like an energy field with Bening using it against her fear of the unknown and then the greater fear of the known. As the serious one with a domineering streak Bening has the harder task unearthing her characters humanity without any of the cuddle factor that everyone else has been given. But as she did in ""American Beauty"" she makes the unlikable understandable forgivable. In ""Kids"" she manages to be funny in ways so subtle you might miss them if they werent so perfectly played in the cock of her head the roll of an eye. And when the deep wounds come and they do youre allowed tears even if Nic isnt.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESContender Qamp;A Julianne Moore on her role in The Kids Are...December 16 2010Annette Bening the steel anchorDecember 2 2010Contender Qamp;A Mark Ruffalo upends a womens world in The...November 18 2010Fresh Faces Josh HutchersonMay 2 2010The Kids Are All Right generates laughs uncertaintyJanuary 27 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTKidsJosh_hutchersonMark RuffaloJosh HutchersonCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-kids-all-right-20100708,0,7212474.story",200,thekidsareallright22,thekidsareallright,latimes

By J.R. Jones Jr_Jones The Kids Are All Right; Dogtooth Dogtooth Opens Friday at the Gene Siskel Film Center. The Kids Are All Right Opens Friday at Century 12 and CineArts 6 Showplace ICON Landmarks Century Centre Renaissance Place and River East 21. THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT Written and directed by Lisa Cholodenko DOGTOOTH Directed by Giorgos Lanthimos Two of the best films youre likely to see this year open in Chicago on Friday. The Kids Are All Right a straightforward comedy-drama by the talented Lisa Cholodenko (High Art Laurel Canyon) looks at an atypical family in Los Angeles--a lesbian couple and their teenage son and daughter each child conceived by a different mother but from the same sperm donor--and finds them to be fairly typical after all. Giorgos Lanthimoss Dogtooth a bizarre black comedy from Greece that won the Un Certain Regard prize at the 2009 Cannes film festival involves a conventional middle-class family--mom dad teenage son two teenage daughters--that turns out to be warped beyond belief. By some odd coincidence both movies are frontal assaults on the traditional nuclear family and comic meditations on how children are shaped (or misshaped) by their parents attitudes toward sexuality. But you might be surprised by what different routes they take to arrive at the same destination. Plenty of movies strive for topicality but occasionally something like The Kids Are All Right slaps you in the face with the world youre actually living in. The first sperm bank in the U.S. opened in the early 70s--almost two generations ago--but this is the first movie I can think of thats treated artificial insemination not as some sort of gimmick for comedy or melodrama but as an established fact of American life. Eighteen-year-old Joni (Mia Wasikowska of Alice in Wonderland) and her 15-year-old brother Laser (Josh Hutcherson) decide to track down their common biological father without consulting their mothers. They find him to be an easygoing restaurateur and organic farmer named Paul (Mark Ruffalo) and as he begins to insinuate himself into the familys life--to the fascination of Lasers mom Jules (Julianne Moore) and the growing anger and dismay of Jonis mom Nic (Annette Bening)--Cholodenko exposes the confused feelings of a family toward someone whos part of them yet a complete stranger. As Jules tells Paul ""I just keep seeing my kids expressions in your face."" At the same time Cholodenko--whos a lesbian herself and has with her partner a four-year-old son by an anonymous sperm donor--seems especially interested in how Joni and Laser discover themselves sexually in a gay family. Much of the comedy comes at the expense of Nic and Jules who like to spice up their humdrum sex life with gay-male porn videos (they accidentally hit the TV remote and blast the soundtrack through the house) and automatically assume that Laser is experimenting sexually with a male buddy (in fact hes increasingly alienated by the guys macho bullshit). When Jules stumbles onto the boys watching one of the porn videos in stunned disbelief its hard to tell whos supposed to feel more busted them or her. Joni has a rocky friendship too with a sex-obsessed girl pal and she isnt sure how to behave with the shy male friend she has a crush on. Both Joni and Laser look to be straight but theyre almost comically unimpressed by their mothers alternative lifestyle; the most important thing theyve picked up from their parents is that love and devotion are more important than sex a thoroughly traditional notion. Of course redefining the family according to this love and devotion rather than any rigid gender roles is a cherished goal of lifestyle liberals and though The Kids Are All Right sometimes smacks of political correctness Cholodenko succeeds brilliantly in making her little clan seem completely run-of-the-mill. ""No phone calls at the table"" Jules scolds her son as the four of them gather for dinner. Her union with Nic resembles any straight marriage thats survived two decades they argue about how to handle the kids about Nics drinking about Juless inability to find a career. The kids are embarrassed by their parents emotionality and irritated by their nagging and household rules. In the end Paul whos straight turns out to be the one whose parenthood is questionable he wants relationships with his children but the only sacrifice hes ever made for them was jerking off into a container for 60 a pop. ""Youre a fucking interloper"" Nic tells him near the end of the movie. ""You want a family? Go make your own."" No one could so easily infiltrate the family in Dogtooth. They live out in the country in a nicely appointed home completely surrounded by a high fence. Stone-faced Father (Christos Stergioglou) works in some sort of sterile industrial plant where he tells coworkers that his wife has been confined to a wheelchair after a tragic accident and refuses to have guests. In fact Mother (Michele Valley) is perfectly healthy and takes responsibility for home-schooling Older Daughter (Aggeliki Papoulia) Son (Hristos Passalis) and Younger Daughter (Mary Tsoni). None of the children has ever been outside the fence and in the opening scene they listen to a cassette tape Mother has recorded to teach them vocabulary words a sea is ""a leather armchair with wooden arms"" a motorway is ""a very strong wind"" an excursion is ""a very resistant material"" and a carbine is ""a beautiful white bird."" The teens--all of them blond and quite beautiful--sit around in their underwear staring blankly at each other as they listen to the tape; you get the feeling theyve been doing so for their entire lives. Fathers worldview is conveyed pretty succinctly by the dog trainer he visits to pick up his Doberman. The trainer refuses to let him go until the training is complete. ""Dogs are like clay"" the trainer tells him ""and our job here is to mold them."" When Son is caught standing out by the fence his punishment is to hold mouthwash in his mouth until Father tells him he can spit. The children are slapped in the face for the smallest infraction of the rules and when Father learns that Older Daughter has gotten hold of some videos he asks her to duct tape one of the VHS cassettes to his hand and then beats her about the head with it. One evening Father asks the teens if theyd like to hear their grandfather singing puts on an LP of Frank Sinatra crooning ""Fly Me to the Moon"" and mistranslates the lyrics for them ""Dad loves us. Mom loves us. Do we love them? Yes we do."" Delighted the kids all stand up and dance around clumsily. Given this bizarre upbringing one cant be too surprised by the childrens infantile sexuality. The only person Father allows inside the fence is Christina (Anna Kalaitzidou) a young security guard he brings home periodically to copulate with Son. Alone in the boys bedroom Christina and Son sit on the bed facing each other and she masturbates him as he stares down at his crotch expressionless. After the children are asleep Father and Mother sit up late watching hardcore porn on TV but the significance of the sex act is completely lost on the teenagers. During her next visit Christina offers Older Daughter a spangled headband to go down on her and the girl agrees; after Christina has departed Older Daughter tries to repeat this transaction with Younger Daughter but asks her sister to lick her shoulder. Only later does Older Daughter figure out what shes doing with Christina worriedly asking the woman ""Do you know what Dad will do if he finds out I lick your keyboard?"" Each movie communicates its sense of the family pretty clearly through its setting which seems appropriate when you consider how kids are affected by their environment. In Dogtooth its the fenced-in yard equally good at confining children and dogs; like inbred animals Son Older Daughter and Younger Daughter are handsome but crazy and one can easily imagine them having to be put down at some point. In The Kids Are All Right its the organic farm tended by Paul and his backyard the landscaping of which Jules takes on as a professional project. Theres a great emphasis on nurturing plants and the fact that Joni and Laser are such demonstrably good people speaks to the power of air and sunlight. The movie ends with Joni going off to college a quotidian scene whose heartache will be familiar to many children and parents. The family in The Kids Are All Right may be wonderfully healthy and the family in Dogtooth desperately sick but both movies come down to the same truth you never really know how successful any family has been until it breaks apart.    v Care to comment?

"The Kids Are All Right offersafinallyaa wonderful film for grown-ups - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs 4 starsThe Kids Are All Right offersafinallyaa wonderful film for grown-upsJuly 08 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticAnnette Bening Julianne Moore Josh Hutcherson Mia Wasikowska and Mark Ruffalo in a scene from ""The Kids are All Right."" (Courtesy of Focus Features)""All right"" doesnt begin to describe it. ""The Kids Are All Right"" is wonderful. Here is a film that respects and enjoys all of its characters the give-and-take and recklessness and wisdom of any functioning family unit conventional or un-. The independently financed 5 million indie picked up for distribution by Focus Features is the easiest movie to love Ive seen all year. In writer-director Lisa Cholodenkos previous theatrical releases the New York-set ""High Art"" and the Los Angeles-set "" Laurel Canyon"" the filmmaker proved adept at examining relationships from close quarters. Shes especially shrewd at delineating how a vulnerable soul can be pulled into undiscovered country perilous and exciting. Every action or transgression comes with a price however and thats why Cholodenko is so good; she sees the reasons behind everyones behavior. Her films are well-made in a straightforward humanistic vein yet emotionally expansive and open-ended like all good fiction. This holds especially true in ""The Kids Are All Right"" which is set in the sunny hillsides of LA and was co-written by Cholodenko and Stuart Blumberg. Already it has become known as the ""lesbian moms film"" or the ""sperm donor dad movie"" both of which are true if reductive. Doctor Nic ( Annette Bening) and her longtime partner Jules ( Julianne Moore) have two teenagers from the same sperm donor. Daughter Joni ( Mia Wasikowska) heading off to college is leaving behind a younger brother Laser ( Josh Hutcherson) who has grown curious about the identity of their father. Contact is made behind the moms backs and in a charmingly awkward scene Mark Ruffalos restaurateur Paul -- an easygoing SoCal satyr open to any new experience -- says hed be willing to have some sort of relationship or friendship with these two. From there the narrative offers an equal number of satisfying inevitables and gratifying surprises. The Bening character a hard-drinking somewhat fearsome control freak doesnt like the idea of this man entering their lives. Moores character a fledgling landscape gardener whos hired to transform Pauls canyon hillside into something more than untended scrub sees him differently more forgivingly. Shes also intrigued by this boy-man in his 40s who seems to live in a seductive fog of availability. Shot on pleasantly hazy 35 mm by cinematographer Igor Jadue-Lillo Cholodenkos film is conversational without being stagey. Bening and Moore have never been looser or wittier on screen and Ruffalo is the perfect foil a man who enjoys a romantic challenge as much as a sure thing. Wasikowska and Hutcherson are two of the truest most direct young screen actors working today. Like Kenneth Lonergans ""You Can Count on Me"" a decade ago which also co-starred Ruffalo ""The Kids Are All Right"" is a triumph of simple technique wedded to complex and satisfying comedy- drama. An LA friend came out of Lonergans film saying ""I love it and I cant even tell you why exactly."" I suspect Cholodenkos achievement will elicit similar responses among all kinds of moviegoers. 4 stars mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating R (for strong sexual content nudity language and some teen drug and alcohol use) Cast Annette Bening (Nic); Julianne Moore (Jules); Mark Ruffalo (Paul); Mia Wasikowska (Joni); Josh Hutcherson (Laser); Yaya DaCosta (Tanya) Credits Directed by Lisa Cholodenko; written by Cholodenko and Stuart Blumberg; produced by Gary Gilbert Jeffrey Levy-Hinte Celine Rattray Jordan Horowitz and Daniela Taplin Lundberg.

Now we have Annette Bening married to Julianne Moore in Lisa Cholodenkos The Kids Are All Right with two teenage children and a pickup truck. Theyre not perfect parents and this is not a perfect movie but boy does it vibrate. No pun intended. Nic (the enchanting Ms. Bening) is obviously the man of the house a no-nonsense Los Angeles doctor with baggy sweaters chopped-off hair and an aggressive swagger who has been married to her partner Jules (Ms. Moore) the feminine flame-haired homemaker in the family for nearly 20 years.  Their healthy intelligent and well-adjusted kids are 15-year-old son Laser (Josh Hutcherson) and 18-year-old daughter Joni (Mia Wasikowska) who have no problem whatsoever being raised by two ""moms"" who were both artificially inseminated by the same sperm donor. (This is the nonjudgmental new world where kids adjust faster than adults to everything from new-fangled technology to same-sex marriage and today is already the new yesterday.) Everything in this cultural zeitgeist is all systems go until the summer before Joni leaves for college when Laser talks her into joining him in a plan to uncover the identity of the birth father they never knew. Unlike the tortured Ann Blyth in Our Very Own who wreaked havoc on her all-American family after she discovered the shame of adoption and found her chain-smoking birth mother guzzling beer in a rundown shack by a railroad track the sensitive thoughtful kids here are so besotted with their real father (never mind the less-than-convincing details of how they find an anonymous sperm donor after 18 years) that they bond immediately hatching a naive plan to bring him into the cosmic family unit. Well when he turns out to be a cool guy named Paul (Mark Ruffalo) a virile easygoing organic gardener and restaurant owner who is something of a kid himself wouldnt you? At first they keep their clandestine meetings with Paul a secret from their two moms but by the time they start hanging out with their new dad on a regular basis Laser inadvertently reveals their subterfuge. Nic the protective mother and uptight family security guard who fears losing her children to the kind of dominant male she has spent her life avoiding shuns any encroachment from the outsider. But Jules who is launching a new landscape-design business agrees to help Paul remodel his organic garden to provide fresh produce for his trendy health food restaurant. The film takes an improbable turn when the attraction that develops between Jules and Paul leads to a full-blown sexual affair. In the ensuing guilt and nerves Jules is torn between her ecstasy with a man who makes her feel like a traditional woman and her marriage vows to Nic; the kids face the possibility that their family will implode; and Paul now emotionally involved with his newly discovered kids is left wondering where he fits into the emotionally wrenching puzzle theyve created. Great acting distinguishes this film which tackles contemporary social issues with the natural rhythm of a heartbeat. Its so cleverly written designed constructed and interpreted that no matter how uncomfortable you feel about the way times have changed (for better or worse) you end up brimming with compassion. I doubt if even the most unyielding of right-wing conservatives will find their equilibrium fazed by the honest way in which homosexual marriage is depicted or the internecine interactions between family members without the ring of soundtrack laughs or Sturm und Drang histrionics. In the wrong hands the comedy elements in the snappy believable dialogue might have bordered dangerously on sitcom mechanics but Ms. Cholodenkos pumiced direction and the urbane finesse of the script a collaboration between the director and Stuart Blumberg keep everything on an even keel. I would have preferred more character development for the two women (we learn almost nothing about either their sexual history or their parenting skills) and I must admit I had trouble with some of their actions. Im no expert on the subject but as weak as I am for Julianne Moore I didnt buy the idea of a committed ""wife"" in a lesbian relationship who leaps eagerly into bed with a hairy heterosexual wolf for the first time in 18 years just because hes horny. Its also a bit disconcerting to see Annette Bening play uber-butch although she does it with scrupulous moment-to-moment authenticity. (Her slow jealous rage when she snoops through Pauls bathroom and finds her partners hair in his hairbrush is so palpable you can see it in her temples.) They are both marvelous but to be honest I had a hard time with two beloved ladies of the screen watching gay porno films in bed while working each other over with a vibrator. But in the course of factoring in so many diverse elements of a complex gay marriage I guess such caveats are small potatoes. For the most part the film is admirable and Ms. Cholodenko seems to know the territory. Her two previous films which I liked enormously High Art and Laurel Canyon were undeserved box office flops. Hopefully this one will find its way to glory. To her credit The Kids Are All Right never seems like a recruitment for the universal legalization of same-sex marriage or a liberal manifesto on sexual politics of any kind. She brings homosexual marriage into the center spot regarding it as no big deal making its impact a very big deal indeed. Some people might blindly and inaccurately accuse this movie of attacking family values but it has exactly the opposite effect. Touching and funny in their upheaval the people in The Kids Are All Right open the door to a brand new examination of family values that leaves you charged and cheering. rreedobserver.com The Kids Are AllrightRunning time 104 minutesWritten by Lisa Cholodenko and Stuart Blumberg Directed by Lisa CholodenkoStarring Annette Bening Julianne Moore Mark Ruffalo Mia Wasikowska Josh Hutcherson 3 Eyeballs out of 4 Comment Filed under Film Movie Review movie reviews The Kids Are All Right Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics The (Real) Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Origin Story Culture Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture Breaking Miamis Wynwood Arts District Is a Hotbed for Zika Politics Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://www.observer.com/2010/culture/modern-family,200,thekidsareallright29,thekidsareallright,observer

Hoberman Lesbian Family Values in The Kids Are All Right Tuesday July 6 2010 at 4 a.m. By J. Hoberman 1 The moms Bening and MooreSuzanne Tenner A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Serious comedy powered by an enthusiastic cast and full of good-natured innuendo Lisa Cholodenkos The Kids Are All Right gives adolescent coming-of-age and the battle of the sexes a unique twist in part by creating a romantic triangle between a long-standing devoutly bourgeois lesbian couple Nic and Jules (Annette Bening and Julianne Moore) and the newly identified merrily free-spirited sperm donor Paul (Mark Ruffalo) responsible for both the couples teenage children Joni and Laser (Mia Wasikowska and Josh Hutcherson).Normality as made clear by the introductory family dinner that features two mothers acting all motherly rules. The kids refer to their American-as-apple-pie parents in the plural as in ""that really hurt the moms feelings."" (The moms designated kink is their occasional use of gay male porn as an aphrodisiac--although even this gets an amusingly didactic explanation.) Whereas Cholodenkos two previous features High Art (1998) and Laurel Canyon (2003) each focused on an innocent young woman swept up in the glamorously baffling sex-and-drugs scene swirling around a charismatic older female artist the situation here is reversed; unexpectedly drawn in to and fascinated by the ultra-domestic household created by a pair of charismatic femmes the swinger is the straight man (literally).A happily hippified gardener-/restaurateur-cum-sex-object Paul is introduced balling his employees and otherwise spreading his (organic) seed. ""I love lesbians"" is his initial response upon coming face-to-face with his grown-up spermatozoa and being informed of their family situation. Although it was the 15-year-old Laser who prompted the father-and-child reunion hes a sensitive jock whos put off by blithely diffident Pauls lack of enthusiasm for team sports; on the other hand big sister Joni still a virgin on the eve of college finds this groovy stud really cool (as in hot). And so does Jules especially after Paul engages her to landscape his backyard. (Unlike her workaholic doctor spouse she has a bit of time on her hands.) We can tell where this is going when she describes Pauls overgrown grounds as ""fecund.""Cholodenkos previous features have amply demonstrated her talent for directing actresses. High Art (1998) her genuinely edgy debut gave aged-out brat-packer Ally Sheedy the opportunity to give her first real adult performance as a reclusive photographer while memorably showcasing then-unknown Patricia Clarkson as Sheedys hilariously Teutonic lover; Laurel Canyon (2003) provided the much-abused Frances McDormand with a rare opportunity to strut her stuff and even extracted a more than default-decorative turn from Kate Beckinsale. Given a reliably stellar duo in Bening and Moore Cholodenko makes their rapport her key performance. The actresses are loose and funny trading off big scenes and clearly enjoying themselves throughout. The acerbic Nic gets the best lines (""I need your observations like I need a dick in my ass"" she snaps when Paul presumes to offer her parenting advice) and even gets to drunkenly yowl her way through Joni Mitchells ""All I Want"" although Jules has the movies pre-eminent solo of truth.Premiered last January at Sundance The Kids Are All Right triggered considerable discussion as well as a lively bidding war. The excitement is unsurprising. Despite or perhaps in accordance with its 60s rock-and-roll title its actually a pretty conservative movie--particularly when compared to Cholodenkos previous works. Given its juicy premise The Kids could have been played for sitcom reality show or soap opera--had it been made in 1970 it might have been an Echo Park Teorema with everyone winding up in bed together. Ten years into the 21st century its a heartfelt poster for family values. Everything new is old again.jhobermanvillagevoice.com Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact J.

By Anthony Lane Mark Ruffalo Annette Bening and Julianne Moore in Lisa Cholodenkos movie.   Credit Illustration by Pablo Lobato Not long ago in ""Mother and Child"" Annette Bening played a controlling easily angered woman who worked in a hospital and found her status as a parent challenged by unforeseen events. Now in ""The Kids Are All Right"" she opts for a complete change of tack playing a controlling easily angered lesbian who works in a hospital and finds her status as a parent challenged by unforeseen events. The drought of intelligent roles for women in middle age is so severe that you have to applaud Bening for seeking out these movies and making them her own yet it would be disingenuous not to be taken aback by the harsh purpose with which so accomplished a seductress--think of her in ""The Grifters"" and ""Bugsy""--has peeled away any trace of glamour in favor of a saturnine frown and a pursed mouth. Her character in the new film is Nic who lives in Los Angeles with her wife Jules (Julianne Moore) and their two children--Joni (Mia Wasikowska) who was needless to say named after Joni Mitchell and her younger brother Laser (Josh Hutcherson) whose name is a less flattering fit. Joni is eighteen a straight-A student about to leave for college and you sense in her behind the shyness and the curtain of long hair a thwarted questing. It leads her to contact a guy named Paul who years ago was the anonymous sperm donor picked by Nic and Jules to be the father of both children. Paul a bearded restaurateur turns out to be randy but unthreatening warm to the touch but cool about stuff with a dash of smugness in his easy smile all of which is a way of saying that he is played by Mark Ruffalo. One of these days someone should cast Ruffalo as a quarterback or a Cistercian monk just to see what happens. ""The Kids Are All Right"" is directed by Lisa Cholodenko from a script that she wrote with Stuart Blumberg and what convinces most in her work here--as it did in her 1998 film ""High Art""--is that it seems honestly torn between adventure and repose. You instantly accept the curiosity that tugs the children into tracking down Paul even if they couldnt explain their own reasons. Equally you know for sure that his intrusion will bring chaos and there is no mistaking the deep breath of relief toward the end when Joni arrives in her college room and discovers after a hundred minutes of full-on bickering a space devoid of antsiness. There are not only glancing moments but whole sequences in this movie when the agony of social embarrassment makes you want to haul the characters to their feet and slap them in the chops. Just watch Joni and Laser who have told their mothers about Paul bringing him home for a meal. Im not sure which is more aghast the look on his face when he is asked ""Did you always know you wanted to be in the food-services industry?"" or the look on Nics face when she discovers that he dropped out of college. One of the reasons the women originally chose him is that he was meant to be studying international relations. Now he says ""Im a doer."" Oh God. All of this is made so much worse by everyones aching need to be holier and hipper than thou. The California that we get in this film is a greener gayer update of the California that Woody Allen took such perfect potshots at more than thirty years ago in ""Annie Hall"" the difference being that Cholodenko doesnt always know that it is funny. She wants us to laugh at Pauls initial response when he learns of the family setup (""I love lesbians"") and she rightly notes the casual bantering racism of the liberal bourgeoisie (listen to Jules address a Mexican gardener) but do the screenwriters not realize that half of the womens conversation--""We just talked conceptually"" ""It hasnt risen to the point of consciousness for you"" ""Its so indigenous""--is pure extra-planetary prattling and nothing but? The prattle turns chronic when Jules who fancies herself as a landscape designer is hired by Paul to reshape his back yard; she suggests ""a trellisy hidden garden kind of thing"" or alternatively ""you could go with the Asiany."" I wouldnt trust her to pick a rose. As anyone could have predicted this new friendship soon becomes what Jules would call making-outy as she and Paul put down their plants and retire to his boudoir. What Cholodenko at her sneakiest is doing here is to ask what occurs when a moral elasticity encounters sturdier more traditional forms of living. Paul for example may only be a makeshift father figure but under his influence Joni begins to stand up for herself against the brittle Nic and Laser is inspired to drop an unsuitable friend--something that his mothers have long been urging him to do without success. As for Jules she gets laid by a man which if nothing else makes a change the problem being that the small tolerant world of these prosperous folk cant handle a change that extreme. Just as the California sunshine somehow loses its relaxing suffusion and hardens into a cruel noontide so by an irony that Cholodenko may not fully have intended the climax of ""The Kids Are All Right"" grows suddenly humorless and close to vengeful in its moralizing glare. Danger shrinks back and the kids are all right again although you have to wonder who the real kids are Joni and Laser wise and wry or their messed-up moms and feckless dad who have so much more to learn? Halfway through dinner in ""The Kids Are All Right"" Nic finds out that she has been betrayed. Without warning other peoples talk dies away to be replaced by a strange churning sound like an underwater helicopter. The sensory world is warped by the force of her feelings. Take that deformation multiply it a hundredfold and you approach the eruptive mania that consumes the hero of ""Inferno"" Henri-Georges Clouzots film--or remarkable stab at a film--from 1964. Marcel (Serge Reggiani) runs a lakeside hotel in France with his wife Odette (Romy Schneider) although his true occupation is jealousy. Every man and woman he sees is a potential paramour of Odette. Fear of cuckoldry starts to play havoc with his brain. The soundtrack is littered with clicks repeats and nonsense chatter like a sort of involuntary hip-hop while the screen pullulates with abstract shapes and color-crazes--a lake turning blood-crimson say while Odette water-skis across it behind a boat whose pilot she may or may not have coupled with. The downside of ""Inferno"" is that it does not exist. You cannot see it and you never will. It was unfinished and perhaps unfinishable that is the conclusion at least to be drawn from ""Henri-Georges Clouzots Inferno "" a new documentary directed by Serge Bromberg and Ruxandra Medrea. Their film is on the slim side but then they are dealing in forlorn fragments a hundred and eighty-five cans of film much of which consists of experimental clips and little of which gives any hint of plot. This may be a hazard of the subject; jealousy is more of a frozen state than a narrative event and we live in an age not of kings like Leontes in ""The Winters Tale"" who could wield his paranoia by damning his blameless queen (""Your actions are my dreams"" he tells her) but of mini-men like Marcel who must suffer in solitude. The question that presses on ""Inferno"" is whether it seized up because Clouzot too was stalled by emotions over which he had no command. He himself denied as much. ""I dont think Im a pathological case"" he said and to be fair the fact that he had a heart attack on location while directing Romy Schneider as she kissed another actress could be read as proof of his incurable Frenchness rather than any graver affliction. On the other hand behind him lay a record of pitiless films beginning with ""Le Corbeau"" in 1943 that sweated with terror and disgust. ""Diabolique"" (1955) depended on a weakhearted woman being literally frightened to death and marital envy and suspicion were already rampant in ""Quai des Orfevres"" (1947) so ""Inferno"" was hardly a symptom without a cause. The problem in this instance always hard for a Frenchman to acknowledge was that of excessive liberty. One of the bemused crew members from that time recalls ""We worked in total freedom."" (There were three separate camera crews often lying idle.) More worrying still was the ""unlimited budget"" that was offered by studio executives from Columbia of all places after they had seen the test footage; even now that seems an amazingly bad call. Total freedom is both the dream of every artist and a promise of catastrophe. If free verse as Robert Frost said is like playing tennis with the net down then free filmmaking means no white lines and no court just an umpire a few players and a load of balls. Claude Chabrol used Clouzots script to make ""LEnfer"" thirty years later but all that remains of Clouzots ideal version are some glistening erotically maddened images of Schneider licking her lips under playful lights writhing naked before an onrushing train or smoking in reverse sucking the cloud back in. What should have been Clouzots masterpiece wound up as the Devils disco.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review The New Normal The Kids Are All Rights portrait of gay parenting is fearless enough to be hugely entertaining. _ By David Edelstein Published Jul 5 2010 ShareThis (Photo Suzanne Tenner/Courtesy of Focus Features) Annette Bening has a genius for a kind of existential actingfor illuminating the chink (or moat or abyss) between a persons front and the quivering creature underneath desperately trying to hold the mask in place. As Nic the more patriarchal half of a same-sex married couple in Lisa Cholodenkos high-strung comedy The Kids Are All Right she wears a short blunt haircut; drops her voice (she purges the tinkle); and presents to her teenage children a boy and a girl a facade of stability of someone who values structure above all. Nics political agenda is unspoken but implicit that two mothers (the other is Jules played by Julianne Moore) can create a home thats every bit as traditional as one with a mother and father. Nic is admirable inspiring but also a bit of a pill (and a compulsive drinker). Like the best comic protagonists she takes herself very very seriously and tries so hard to do the right thingwhich all but guarantees that her orderly world will become unmoored and collapse in a shower of travestied ideals. It happens like this As her inward angry son Laser (Josh Hutcherson) skateboards on the edge of delinquency her daughter Joni (Mia Wasikowska) decides to track down a true father figure for the boyin this case their anonymous sperm donor. (Both Joni and her half-brother have the same biological dad although each mother carried a child.) Enter Paul (Mark Ruffalo) a shambling freewheeling bachelor restaurateur. When he shows up for dinner on his motorcycle Nic regards this interloper with distaste bordering on horror. (Benings frozen deadpan barely conceals a hundred different impressionsall bad.) But the flightier femme-ier Jules is intrigued. Cholodenko who wrote the screenplay with Stuart Blumberg has a female partner and a child and in this political climate with gay marriage and parenting under fire you wouldnt expect shed even flirt with the notion that two moms arent enough. But shes a true comic dramatist. She tests what is presumably her ideal her design for living; she bombards it with every weapon in her arsenal. Then she surveys the wreckage ostensibly in the hope it can be reassembled into something more in balance. And why not? Boys do in this culture look to fathers to help form their identities. Introspective modern kids do attempt to discern which parts of their personalities are nature and which nurture. As in her High Art and (to a lesser extent) Laurel Canyon Cholodenkos world is too complex too discombobulated to let the characters she lovesall of whom practice an alternative lifestyleget away with thinking their revolutionary bubbles are necessarily impregnable. Cholodenko and Blumberg reportedly wrote many drafts of The Kids Are All Right and the scenes are beautifully shaped. Moores dithery lyricism carries echoes of Diane Keaton but as a duettist shes in a class of her own. She takes on the rhythms of her co-starsimplying that marriage to someone as strong-willed as Nic would have kept Jules soft and suggestible. When alone with Paul for whom shes designing a backyard garden she turns giddy and girlish and self-deprecating. Its easy to see why shes charmed. Working in mainstream films Ruffalo has been in danger of losing that incisive flakiness that made him so magnetic in Kenneth Lonergans You Can Count on Me. Well its back baby. Whats so winning is how hard Paul who is naturally abstracted tries to make contact first with supreme awkwardness with his biological kids; and then with the woman who gives him a glimpse of how good domesticityhow making gardens growmight feel. The kid actors are more than all rightless showy but sharp. Wasikowska has the gift of watchfulness. Her Joni (named yes for the singer) is about to leave for college and needs to fit together the pieces of her puzzle life. She also needs to leave her half-brother in a better place. Hutcherson at first seems too closed off but thats part of his strategy. More and more he lets you in not all the way but enough to let you glimpse in embryo the person whos fighting to emerge. The title like Nicole Holofceners Please Give is one that trails you out of the theater and gives you something to brood on. (It has nothing to do with the Whowho spelled all right wrong anyway.) I think Cholodenko wants you to see that despite the gaps and uncertainties in the pioneer family life of Nic and Jules Joni and Laser have enough of a foundation enough love to grope their way to all-rightness. That this idea might be viewed as radical or degenerate is part of the larger tragicomedy of American life. But the self-satire of The Kids Are All Right is so knowing so rich so hilarious so damn healthy that it blows all thoughts of degeneracy out of your head. 1 2 Next Share this story...

This comfortable Southern California family has got problems like any other Benings Nic a driven sharp-edged doctor relies a bit too much on red wine to soften up; Moores Jules is prone to insecurity and cant get a career in gear. (Her newest venture is landscape gardening.) Their daughter Joni (Alice in Wonderlands radiant Mia Wasikowska) an A student about to leave the nest for college feels the strain of high expectations. Their 15-year-old son Laser (Josh Hutcherson) doesnt even realize how much hes been missing a fatherly presence until after hiding the quest from their moms the siblings track down their biological ""donor dad"" Paul (Mark Ruffalo) a loose and groovy bachelor restaurateur. (Ruffalo looks sexy as hell harvesting organic veggies for the restaurants locavore menu.) With the addition of Pauls footloose hetero masculine energy -- he might as well stitch the motto ""Its all good"" on his motorcycle jacket -- the clan is in for some bumps ahead. I dont know whats more delightful -- that The Kids Are All Right stars Bening Moore and Ruffalo at the top of their games in an irresistible story of lesbian marriage sperm-donor fatherhood sex red wine and teen angst. Or that this warm funny sexy smart movie erases the boundaries between specialized ""gay content"" and universal ""family content"" with such sneaky authority. So lets say both and give high fives (or whatever they give in Southern California) to director Lisa Cholodenko (High Art Laurel Canyon) and her co-writer Stuart Blumberg for using the components of a commercial dramedy to cross boundaries with such indie elan. (Perhaps theres no substitute for experience; Cholodenko and her partner are mothers of a young son.) Guided by an outstanding script everyone is able to go deep into her or his character. Particular huzzahs are due Bening for the precision she brings to the brusque yet emotionally expressive Nic. A famously natural mature beauty in a Hollywood culture of youth-oriented artifice Bening uses physical authenticity as a source of dramatic strength. Comfortable in her own skin shes at ease inhabiting the body and exposing the soul of Nic a complicated woman who also knows exactly who she is.

Sparked by wonderfully lived-in performances from Julianne Moore and Mark Ruffalo ""The Kids Are All Right"" is all right if not up to the level of writer-director Lisa Cholodenkos earlier pair of new bohemian dramas ""High Art"" and ""Laurel Canyon."" Once again the focus is on the neuroses of well-off hipsters living alternatively in conservative times as a Los Angeles lesbian couple (Moore and Annette Bening) are rattled by the unexpected introduction of their hippie sperm donor (Ruffalo) to their teenage kids. Commercial prospects look solid for an ingratiating sitcom-style entertainment whose genuinely stirring moments come rather late in the game. Cholodenkos uncharacteristic degree of comedy (in combination with her unusually high budget) can be understood and to a fair extent applauded as a principled bid to sell alt-family values to the mainstream. The kids of a married lesbian couple are alright indeed even or especially if that couple is wacky in familiar ways. Alas this is the sort of movie in which illicit lovers agree that theyll never ever hook up again followed by a shot of them lounging post-coitus in bed. Cholodenkos previous work has been about how its complicated to keep relationships from turning messy; this film simply has too much of ""Its Complicated."" What the directors formulaic third feature does retain in full is her palpable and infectious love for characters and actors alike. By far the least likable of the bunch uptight doctor Nic (Bening) nevertheless appears engagingly severe from the point when she learns that 18-year-old Joni (Mia Wasikowska) and 15-year-old Laser (Josh Hutcherson) -- yes Laser -- have secretly sought out and met their biological father Paul (Ruffalo). Moores well-sketched Jules is at once whip-smart and loopy an underachiever whose landscaping biz remains stuck in low gear until Paul an organic crop farmer and restaurateur who starts coming to family dinners offers her work on his scruffy backyard. This development naturally abrades the wine-guzzling Nic as college dropout Paul acting warm and sounding seductive via Ruffalos lilting purr appeals irresistibly to the kids in paternal terms and to Jules in sneakily sexual ones. Nics eventual realization that Jules and Paul have been tending more than his bushes is indelibly captured in a moment whose slo-mo closeup on scowling Nic pumped up with sludgy background noise makes it play like a fight scene in ""Raging Bull."" Its more or less at this point that the movie like the characters begins to drop its glib defenses and score on an emotional level. The alternately comfy and edgy rapport between Moore and Bening hits peak levels in a scene where the two begin to pull apart. By far the screenplay by Cholodenko and Stuart Blumberg is most incisive in the films final reels as the effects of a culture clash waged on multiple fronts -- male and female gay and straight educated and experienced -- literally come home to roost. As before Cholodenko generously shares her keen ear for pop the soundtrack ranging from classic rock to Wendy amp; Lisa along with a too-cute scene wherein Nic and Paul in a rare moment of bonding warble their way through a rendition of Joni Mitchells ""All I Want."" Working with stellar production designer Julie Berghoff the director also displays a vividly geographic feel for L.A.s funkier leftist enclaves. All across the frame tech credits for this upscale indie production are of studio-film sheen.
