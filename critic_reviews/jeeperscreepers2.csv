It also authoritatively answered the age-old question ""Whered you get those peepers?"" (A The eye sockets of a screeching adolescent.) Where does this leave its sequel? Stranded on a country road in a school bus full of succulent and supremely stupid teenagers of course. Seems the winged man-eating beast of the first film is now winding up his 23-day feeding frenzy which only comes around every 23 years. (""Evil loves prime numbers"" would have made a better tag line than ""He can smell your fear."") The kids use the occasion of being hunted by an organ-devouring demon to debate long-simmering issues of race and sexual orientation. Once thats sorted out they proceed to make choices straight out of the ""How Not to Survive a Horror Movie"" handbook. Thus writer-director Victor Salva squanders all of his original movies not-entirely-awfulness and bumbles into the realm of unintentional comedy. (Two words Headless break-dancing.) His scenes shot in daylit cornfields are the most effectively frightening. Unfortunately hes all too eager for the sun to set so his computer-generated bogeyman can take to the skies. In the first flick the ""Creeper"" - no doubt constrained by budget - was deceptively manlike He drove a truck had a penchant for arts and crafts (involving human skin) and enjoyed whistling old Johnny Mercer tunes (leaving open the tantalizing possibility that he was in fact Johnny Mercer). Now that hes airborne 90 percent of the time hes just another effect - and not a terribly special one either.

"Dont Fear the Creeper washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Museums and Galleries >> Follow Style On Dont Fear the Creeper Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday August 28 2003 The Creeper is back. Actually he or it never really went away. Introduced in Victor Salvas 2001 sleeper hit ""Jeepers Creepers"" the functional but tiresome sequels Creeper -- a cross between Freddy Krueger the Creature from the Black Lagoon and a pterodactyl who rises out of a pit in the ground every 23 years for a total of 23 days to feed by the looks of things mainly on aspiring teenage underwear models -- is just now finishing up the meal he began in the earlier film. Now hes ready for dessert which in this case is a busload of cornfed high school football players and cheerleaders whose transportation back from the big game has become suspiciously disabled by an ugly-looking throwing star made of razor-sharp talons held together with human skin. Meant to evoke Alfred Hitchcocks ""Lifeboat"" in its sense of confinement and focus on the dramatic bickering of its canful of human anchovies the films real antecedent is ""Moby Dick."" True ""Jeepers Creepers 2"" spends the first half on and around the bus as first one then another of the no-name stars (Travis Schiffner? Eric Nenninger?) get decapitated or otherwise killed but its second half is devoted to a showdown between the Creeper and Ray Wise. Filling the Captain Ahab role as a farmer who has lost his son to the Creeper Wise tracks the monster hither and yon with an air-powered harpoon mounted to the back of his pickup truck. Fans of the Herman Melville book or the film starring Gregory Peck may get a small kick out of the allusions to the whale story but the protracted back-and-forth eventually seems to merely delay what is in the end a foregone conclusion. JEEPERS CREEPERS 2 (R 104 minutes) -- Contains obscenity and gore. Area theaters.

Exactly two years after the grotesque teen horror film ""Jeepers Creepers"" flooded Americas multiplexes and grossed 38 million original writer/director Victor Salva returns with a sequel unsurprisingly entitled ""Jeepers Creepers 2."" Few things are scarier thana sequel to a bad movie but in fact ""Jeepers Creepers 2"" is substantially better than its predecessor even while staying strictly within the genres well-defined boundaries. Theres nothing new here but B.O. will be boosted if word of mouth brings in some of those who disliked the first film in addition to the presold audience of those who loved it. Opening shots of a farm are superimposed adorned with the information ""Every 23rd spring ... for 23 days ... it gets to eat"" -- a crucial line from the first film. And then a nice addendum ""Day 22."" Towheaded teen Billy Taggart (Shaun Fleming) is working in the fields when the Creeper (Jonathan Breck) -- the winged demon-faced monster from the first film -- swoops down and carries him off. Understandably Billys dad Jack Taggart (Ray Wise) is upset to see his son abducted by a flying monster. Slumping into a catatonic stupor he apparently never gets around to calling the cops. Soon however his other son Jack Jr. (Luke Edwards) rouses him to action. Since it appears that the senior Taggart is fortuitously a welder and a smithy in addition to being a farmer he heads out to the barn to build anti-Creeper weapons. Meanwhile a school bus carrying a basketball team coaches and three cheerleaders (for gender diversity) develops two flat tires -- courtesy of high-speed four-pointed darts fashioned out of bone by you-know-who -- and cant seem to raise any help on the radio or with cell phones. A bunch of guys take off their shirts and lie on top of the bus a veritable buffet that the Creeper inexplicably chooses to ignore...for now. Pretty soon night falls and the bus driver and the coaches are (literally) dead meat. The kids have to figure out whether to stay in the bus or run for it as the Creeper starts picking them off one at a time. While the first film started with a long tease -- basically a retread of Steven Spielbergs ""Duel"" -- before showing the Creeper and segueing into a villagers-versus-monster pic theres no point in delaying the entrance of the villain this time around Viewers already know what he looks like. So Salva centers the film around a single classic narrative thread -- a group of people isolated and under attack by an apparently unbeatable foe -- much in the manner of ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""The Birds"" (the latter is explicitly referred to). The only real questions are When will the minor plot thread about Taggart merge with the central action on the bus? Which of the largely interchangeable teenagers will survive? Salva relies heavily on standard devices -- shock cuts false buildups of suspense and most effectively showing the Creeper in the background about to attack while the characters in the foreground have no clue. There is a certain amount of gross-out gore -- the films R rating is well deserved -- but less than in number one. There are also a few glaring plot implausibilities but more irritating is the business about the Creeper coming back every 23 years If thats the case why do this film and its 23-years-on epilogue seem to be taking place in exactly the same time as the first film with people driving late-90s cars 46 years from now? Tech work is excellent all-around with special kudos to cinematographer Don E. FauntLeRoys crisp night scenes. Bennett Salvays score may be hugely derivative -- bits of Stravinsky Bartok and Marius Constants ""Twilight Zone"" theme drift through -- but its very effective.

Starring Nicki Aycox and Jonathan Breck. Directed by Victor Salva. (R. 106 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Jeepers Creepers 2"" has a trivial-sounding title and would be a completely routine horror movie except that it has a superior director. Watch this film for five minutes and its clear that Victor Salva knows how to make movies. An early image -- an overhead shot of a yellow-haired boy running through a golden cornfield on a blazing summer day while being chased by a black flying thing -- is such a mix of earthly beauty and unconscious terror that it could make anyone a believer. Salva is no punch-up-the-soundtrack-and-kick-the-camera director of action. Hes a classicist. He builds a mood through compositions that register as eerie without our really knowing why. There are long shots that emphasize the space around people -- and thus their vulnerability. There are tight shots that make us worry about whats outside our line of vision. Borrowing from Hitchcock he gives us medium shots with such a depth of field that we wonder what might come flying out from the background. But then comes the night and all the advantages of Salvas compositional intelligence are neutralized. So thats what we get with ""Jeepers Creepers 2."" For the first 40 minutes or so while the movie takes place in the daytime we have a brilliantly filmed version of a typical horror script. Once night descends the film descends with it. It becomes merely competent and the flaws and the gracelessness of the screenplay -- which Salva wrote -- become more obvious. Still at least Salva has the dignity and the commitment to play it straight with ""Jeepers Creepers 2"" and not go for cheap laughs. He takes his premise seriously There is an ancient creature who lives underground for years at a time. At regular intervals he comes out and then does nothing but eat for 23 days straight -- think of it as the monster equivalent of an Italian vacation. Only this fiend isnt eating lobster fra diavolo. Hes eating people though not entire people and not just anybody. He picks certain people he likes and devours specific organs. Fine thatll do for a gimmick. He also has an arresting look. He conceals his horrible face under a black hat and his wings (yes he has wings) under a black cape. He looks like a Civil War veteran turned outlaw from an old Western. He looks like our collective vision of rustic black-hearted evil. The kid in the cornfield is the first to be swooped up. Thats the monsters modus operandi With lightning speed he swoops down and takes his victims straight into the sky. But picking off one kid at a time is too inefficient. The main action of the story involves a high school basketball team traveling by bus through a remote stretch of farmland. To the monster this is a buffet on wheels. The fiend easily stops the bus and after two or three people vanish into the ether the kids surmise that they may be in danger. ""Jeepers Creepers"" becomes a story about teenagers stuck on the bus in the middle of nowhere being stalked by evil. But unlike the characters stuck on a boat in Hitchcocks ""Lifeboat"" the kids are indistinct and -- with the exception a young mystic (Nicki Aycox) -- interchangeable. In the end its hard to see on what basis the fiend might choose to devour one and not another.. Advisory This film contains strong language and graphic violence.

Its hard to imagine however how a vaguely reptilian flesh-eating winged scarecrow could be anyones idea of a good time. From right to left are Marieh Delfino Travis Schiffner Al Santos Eric Nenninger and Nicki Aycox in a scene from Jeepers Creepers 2. The plot of Jeepers Creepers 2 is even more implausible than most scarefests. Every 23 years for 23 days a revolting ravenous creature is unleashed on an unsuspecting Middle America for a ferocious feeding frenzy. (Related item Watch a clip of Jeepers Creepers 2) More on the movie Jeepers Creepers 2 1/2 (out of four) Stars Ray Wise Jonathan Breck Eric Nenninger Garikayi Mutambirwa Nicki Aycox Director Victor Salva Distributor United Artists Rating R for horror violence and language Opens today nationwide In an unintentionally funny segment terrified jocks and cheerleaders returning by school bus from a victorious basketball game receive instruction on the methods behind the monsters madness. (The Creeper already has made off with the bus driver and coach so the kids are running the show.) The voice of reason emanates from a spacey clairvoyant cheerleader who explains that the creature chooses its victims after sensing their fear. One would suspect that a giant slimy being with long pointed teeth and bat wings would elicit fear in any human unlucky enough to encounter it. But somehow this clever creature divines levels of fear and strikes accordingly. The performances are what one might expect. Wide bugged-out eyes and open mouths are the standard acting choices. But worse this movie manages to be boring. The Creeper has only a few malevolent moves swooping from the sky attacking viciously and flying off with his prey. At times he hangs upside down peering into the school bus window with a leering and oddly stupid grin. The thrills chills frights starts and occasional screams that a good horror film elicits from an audience are not there. Jeepers the Creeper has little to recommend it.
