Comments click to enlarge Kissing Jessica Stein Watch on Netflix Though the feeling persists that this movie wants to bring the spirit of Neil Simon--meaning the Jewish middle class and the New York suburbs--to lesbian farce this adaptation by costars Jennifer Westfeldt and Heather Juergensen of their own off-Broadway play is both better and worse than that description implies. Better because the cast is wonderful and the story is commendably free of the sectarian us-versus-them tone of many romantic gay movies and worse because the jazzy vocals are too strident and Charles Herman-Wurmfelds direction lacks the polish of a well-mounted Simon comedy. Still this is possibly the funniest lesbian romp since Go Fish. 94 min.

So begins the funny likable romantic comedy ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" a movie that rises above its sitcom premise by virtue of its charm warmth and clear-eyed vision of the perils of any relationship.The two stars are also the writers. Theyre not interested in another coming-out story but in exploring the muddy line between friendship and sexual love. The comedy gets better and more unpredictable as it goes and so do the performances. Tovah Feldshuh as Jessicas mom starts as a cartoon and develops lovely depths. Unlike its confused heroine who cant integrate her private and public lives director Charles Herman-Wurmfelds movie knows what it wants what its limits are and delivers its delights accordingly.

""Kissing Jessica Stein"" is pure pleasure. A fresh take on sex and the single girl this buoyant well-crafted romantic comedy blends pitch-perfect performances with deliciously smart writing by actor-scribes Jennifer Westfeldt and Heather Juergensen. Previously in development at Gramercy (the filmmakers reacquired rights when it seemed their project might atrophy in turnaround) pic has above-average commercial potential for an indie production and would be a feather in the cap of a distributor with the savvy to adroitly position it for a young femme -- and potentially broader ""Bridget Jones"" -- audience. Title character played by Westfeldt is a sort of Jewish Ally McBeal who works in a publishing house alongside her garrulous pregnant friend Joan (Jackie Hoffman) and smug ex-b.f. Josh (Scott Cohen). Frustrated at her inability to find love Jessica embarks on a series of disastrous first dates effectively presented in an amusing montage. Its only when she reads a personal ad quoting Rilke that Jessicas interest is piqued but theres only one problem The ad was placed by a woman. Though shes resolutely straight Jessica decides to meet the ads author a free-spirited art gallery manager named Helen (Juergensen). To her surprise and chagrin the sheltered Jessica is quite taken with Helen. Finding they have much in common -- including their heterosexual track records -- Jessica and Helen strike up a warm and quirky courtship. As Jessica finds herself falling for Helen shes forced to confront her own insecurities her friends preconceived notions and the apprehensions of her overprotective mother (Tovah Feldshuh). It all comes to a head at her brothers wedding where she must decide whether shes strong enough to admit their bond publicly. Its giving nothing away to say that one member of the duo decides she is not a lesbian a denouement handled with gentle grace and ample humor. Credible sympathetic perfs are key to the films appeal. Having spent many months exploring Helen and Jessicas relationship in their stage play ""Lipschtick"" Juergensen and Westfeldt know their characters intimately. Their resulting onscreen dynamic ably guided by Charles Herman-Wurmfelds breezy direction feels entirely naturalistic. Supporting turns are also first-rate. Feldshuh gives an achingly poignant and multilayered performance as Judy Stein a woman who is much more perceptive than she appears. And Hoffman gives a terrifically funny interpretation of Jessicas meddling but well-meaning friend staying just the right side of caricature. Tech aspects are tops notably the editing by Kristy Jacobs Maslin and Gregory Tillman which helps propel the movie like a fast-moving train. Only fault and its hardly that lies in the few instances where the laughs come too close together to be digested fully.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

"Pucker Up and Laugh washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Movies Pucker Up and Laugh Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Wednesday March 20 2002 Jessica Stein has a problem. Everybody wants to kiss her. Shes that cute. To see her is to want to kiss her. She looks like Lisa Kudrow and she has Sandra Bullocks laugh and under it all that would be Cameron Diazs body. I would have even kissed the screen upon which Jessicas giant image is flung but there were security guards between it and me and a reputation as well as a career to consider. But heres the real problem for Jessica She doesnt want to be kissed. None of the men she meets is good enough to plant lips on that perfect button of a face to the tune of that melodious surge of a self-aware giggle. No Jessica doesnt want to be kissed until she meets . . . Helen. Hmm. You can see the question on which ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" is based Can a nice Jewish girl from Scarsdale find happiness in the arms of a beautiful if scrawny shiksa from - well from south of Houston Street? Its not that Jessica has a thing for girls. Its just that she has a thing for Helen. ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" brilliant and brilliantly slight (96 minutes a blessing) explores Jessicas difficulty which turns out to be that she wants a best friend while Helen - oh you scamp - wants a snugglebunny. The movie written and performed by two actresses who will undoubtedly ride it to the big time is the freshest hippest un-hippiest (The gals are both skinny They eat like birds) romantic comedy to come along in months possibly years. So its a chick-meets-chick chick-loses-chick chick-gets-chick movie. Most of us can live with that. Jessica played by the adorable Jennifer Westfeldt and Helen played by the gangly weirdly beautiful Heather Juergensen are typically neurotic if reluctant players in the meat market of New York dating. Both are sick and tired of it Jessica of the matches her overbearing mother (Tovah Feldshuh) arranges with successful if unbearably dreary Jewish men; Helen of the slick arty types who fill her world (shes a gallery manager). Its Helen who realizes theres one niche in her experiential resume as yet unfilled. Its Helen who takes out the Village Voice personal ad that hits all the right notes (that is if you consider Rilke a right note but thats another story) and Jessica who sees it falls in love with it and is then perplexed to discover that its in the Women Seeking Women category. But such is her love for someone who digs Rilke that she throws caution to the wind. You know how it is when its right? It can turn on something seemingly frivolous but actually freighted with meaning At that awkward first meeting which is going south in a hurry Helen uses the word ""marinate"" and somehow that really gets to Jessica. That works? Hard to believe but the movie says it does. So the funny business starts literally. The screenplay which was begun as a comedy sketch focuses on the two non-lesbians as they try to gropingly negotiate their way through a lesbian sex experience. Nobodys sure what to do or where to do it or who does it first. But then they figure out that theyve got everything a man has except for the one thing that wasnt that important in the first place. (Ouch) It wouldnt be nearly so funny if it werent so real. Thats the fabulous thing about ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" which is that even as it clings to classic romantic-comedy artifice - lovers separated by their ambivalence toward their own sexuality - it never feels farcical manipulative or curse of curses zany. (""Zany"" is what studio publicists call unfunny comedies.) Its actually quite touching as each of these women while keeping up impossibly witty and knowing repartee nevertheless emerges as truly human. One is the Jewish American Princess the other the daffy artnik with the killer body; but in time you dont see Jewish and cute or gentile and hot you just see people. Then the film creates a world for each of them a tangled skein of pain and family and expectation worried friends supportive friends disappointed friends even jealous friends. Its funny and human and really pretty damned wonderful all at once. KISSING JESSICA STEIN (R 96 minutes) - Contains sexual situations. At General Cinema at Mazza Gallerie.

As the story opens we see the title heroine (Jennifer Westfeldt) - a pretty single Jewish woman who appears to be in her late twenties or early thirties - sitting with her mother and grandmother in a Scarsdale synagogue where prayer and reflection are low on the agenda. While the rabbi expounds and Jessica squirms her mother (Tovah Feldshuh) catalogs various Jewish men with whom she has tried to match her picky daughter. All apparently are too dull or average or balding or otherwise defective to meet Jessicas standards - and Grandmas. ""No sex appeal"" cackles the old lady who has evidently watched too many repeats of ""The Golden Girls."" Ah so this is how it is Neurotic Jewish heroine (a journalist for fashions sake at a hip New York weekly newspaper) from a family of yentas seeks Jerry Seinfeld/Mr. Big/Mr. Darcy look-alike for amusing quips misunderstandings situational laughs and snazzy Dwell magazine set decoration. But no. ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" then takes a ""Sex and the City"" turn In flibbertigibbety frustration exacerbated by the happiness of family and friends around her - brother engaged to a Nice Jewish Girl office friend finally pregnant - Jessica decides to try dating a woman. So she answers a personal ad. She meets Helen (Heather Juergensen) a similarly slim pretty groovily dressed plugged-in gallery owner also looking to double her romantic options. The two women stumble and giggle as probationary lesbians. And some hilarity ensues padded out with useful conversation about lipstick application. Cute? Sure why not Who wouldnt enjoy snappy conversations between attractive women about how to do that thing that Sapphists do. Trendy? Probably more than Juergensen and Westfeldt who wrote their screenplay based on their 1997 Off Off Broadway ""Lipschtick"" could have known what with everyone coming out Rosie these days. Insightful? Maybe about cosmetics and the relative elasticity of female sexual identity the way some women can go girl-girl (to the excitement of some men) and then come back to men unencumbered by gay or straight labels (to the excitement of Coley Laffoon). But if I waver in my enthusiasm less than easily charmed by a movie trying so cheerfully to entertain (hey lady lighten up) its because ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" is all too content to be a comedy of surfaces and stereotypes. And because for all the novelty of the bisexual romantic angle theres something about Jessica her New York-singleton ticks and her Jewish-family tocks that feels...old. Possibly even as old as 1977 when ""Annie Hall"" set the movie blueprint for smart-ditz urban single girls in the modern age. Certainly Westfeldt ought to be paying royalties to Diane Keaton for such generous appropriation of Keatons influential mannerisms - the la-di-da fluttering and stuttering the Gee no I cant can I? insecurity. We accept that Jessica is interested in a relationship with another woman because she says she is but theres nothing in the self-conscious performance to suggest that Jessica is really interested in anyone - not in Helen; not in her editor and college boyfriend Josh (Scott Cohen) a standard-issue commitmentphobe whos got his own case of ""Anything but Love"" itchies; not in her family either. Shes dull As directed by feature first-timer Charles Herman-Wurmfeld with all the inventive use of on-the-fly location shooting a low budget could muster this Jessica is a dull part-time lesbian and full-time ditherer Its her mother whos interesting. In the past decade or so Tovah Feldshuh has taken a lot of roles in the category defined by dramaturges and Yiddishists as baleboosteh - part peerless homemaker part professional ball of fire - in characters ranging from high-powered defense attorney on ""Law amp; Order"" to Catskill mama in ""A Walk on the Moon."" But Ive never seen Feldshuh steal the show so completely and definitively as in one scene in ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" where the Jewish-mama act is dropped and real loving connection takes place between mother and daughter. Its a scene so unlike any other in this skim-decaf-cappucino cup of cinema that it actually throws the rest of the movie into disarray - a scene in which an older actress says ""Okay girls youve got the frothy lines but Ill show you some hot stuff."" At that moment by the way the very shape of the Stein Chronicles shifts because theres so little of the opening scenes cartoonish matchmaking noodge in this depiction of an ideal mother who could be so sensitive to her daughters emotional needs. At that moment too the daughter gives up wifty scatterbrained childish things and becomes a far more appealing grown-up. The dramatic possibilities are tantalizing. And ignored. After that moment ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" returns to the regularly scheduled program already in progress.

Photo KATY RADDATZ Same-sex love affair played for laughs 1 / 2 Back to Gallery KISSING JESSICA STEIN Romantic comedy. Starring Jennifer Westfeldt Heather Juergensen Tovah Feldshuh Scott Cohen. Directed by Charles Herman- Wurmfeld. Written by Westfeldt and Juergensen. (R. 96 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" a movie about two straight women who start a lesbian affair is more a prolonged peck than a deep soul kiss. Charming and witty its also somewhat clumsy. The movie fits in the same category as last years ""Big Eden"" a same-sex love story that doubles as a family film one that values female friendship and a mothers love as highly as it does romance. The ""R"" rating is misleading since the womens courtship is played for laughs and the explicit stuff is only verbal. ""Jessica Stein"" provides a showcase for gifted comic actress Jennifer Westfeldt (TVs ""Two Guys a Girl and a Pizza Place"") whos like Lisa Kudrow without the practiced air. Westfeldt is pretty sly and lovably neurotic as Jessica a New York City newspaper copy editor so fed up with men that she answers a ""women seeking women"" ad placed by an art-world libertine named Helen (Heather Juergensen). That the women decide to ""become"" gay might strike some gay folks as a funky notion. But their relationship is presented with such wit and compassion that you think of them as just a couple not a sexual category. Juergensen an appealing actress who wrote the script with Westfeldt has the more difficult role in Helen. Her oversexed character is bedding a bike messenger and her married boss when she decides shell also give the ladies a whirl. In other words shes the kind of woman who exists on ""Sex and the City"" but never in real life. Juergensen works against the constraints by showing the tenderness and shy ardor Helen feels for Jessica from the first time they meet. They court cute negotiating just how far to go on each date. When Helen tries to get to first base without prior consent Jessica freaks. ""I think were coming along pretty well"" Jessica says later as if they were cramming for the SATs. The actresses have an obvious rapport making their characters believably giddy at the prospect of getting a new lover and new best friend in the same package. Some of the most intriguing moments happen when the lines start to blur. ""Jessica"" was made on the cheap and the seams sometimes show. Helens gay male friends accuse her of being a poseur in a scene that seems obligatory (though it has some tasty vulgar humor). A sitcom-y bit showing Jessicas pre- Helen bad dates is beyond tired. These shortcuts undermine the great care with which the actors and director Charles Herman-Wurmfeld have shaped the characters. Tovah Feldshuh who has the kindest eyes onscreen plays Jessicas mother. Her scenes with Westfeldt have a genuine warmth as Jessica learns that her mom might be more perceptive than she thought. The mother-daughter moments show that a relationship doesnt have to be new to flourish. As Jessicas boss and ex-boyfriend Scott Cohen at first hovers around the edges a bitter reminder of her dating past. But Cohen slowly reveals the decent fellow beneath the newspaper-guy hubris. That this character is developed beyond a stereotypical lout testifies to the open-minded spirit of ""Kissing Jessica Stein."" Advisory This film contains raw language sexual situations.

"Kissing Jessica Stein | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; kissing-jessica-stein ) Kissing Jessica Stein (United States 2001) A movie review by James Berardinelli The smart romantic comedy occurs so infrequently that it has obtained an almost mythical status sort of like Santa Claus or the Tooth Fairy. In the subgenre of gay and lesbian romantic comedies intelligence is even rarer. Since the ratio of good to bad movies is about the same in the gay/lesbian niche as it is for mainstream films and there are far fewer pictures made to accommodate the homosexual audience it stands to reason that it can be difficult to find a gay and/or lesbian romantic comedy with a strong enough script to appeal not only to its core viewers but to a wider audience. Kissing Jessica Stein is one of those uncommon movies. Without resorting to hyperbole I can state that Kissing Jessica Stein may be the best same-sex romance I have seen (the other candidate Show Me Love is as much a coming-of-age story as anything else). The screenplay is written with a thinking audience in mind the dialogue sparkles the characters leap off the screen in full three-dimensionality and the cliches are kept to a bare minimum. Plus unlike the average romantic comedy (of either the homo- or heterosexual variety) this one deals with thought provoking issues. To wit if a person is not gay but is in love with someone of the same sex how do they display that emotion? Is it possible to have romantic love without a physical expression of it? Neither of the two principles in this movie is a lesbian. Jessica (Jennifer Westfeldt) is straight. Her entire sexual history has been one of pairing with men and the very thought of having a sexual relationship with another woman is... well... a little weird. Helen (Heather Juergensen) on the other hand is bisexual. Her primary partners are men but there are times when she feels in the mood for female companionship and usually has no difficulty procuring it. When Jessica and Helen meet Helen is on the prowl. The two do not immediately connect romantically but there is a spark and it doesnt take long for their new friendship to begin straying into the sexual realm. Jessica is nervous about sleeping with Helen but Helen is patient. She knows that Jessica loves her but that crossing the line is difficult. Meanwhile at her office where Jessica works as a proofreader she has to deal with her ex-lover (Scott Cohen) whose frequent put-downs and pugnacious nature may hide feelings that he is unwilling to admit. Kissing Jessica Stein has been called a ""lesbian Annie Hall"" and while such a description is too facile its easy to understand its origins. Like Woody Allens classic romantic comedy this movie chronicles the entire arc of a relationship not just the beginning. Both films effectively wed comedy and drama never veering too much in one direction or another. Each is set in the shadow of the towering skyscrapers of Manhattan. Finally Annie Hall and Kissing Jessica Stein display an understanding of human nature that far far too many motion pictures ignore. The average romantic comedy relies almost exclusively on the chemistry between the leads; the plot is usually a throw-away. In this case we are fortunate to have both an interesting storyline and actresses who interact with each other in a pleasant unforced manner. Jennifer Westfeldt and Heather Juergensen give solid unaffected performances as Jessica and Helen respectively. They experience no difficulty with the range required by their roles - each seems perfectly at home with the comedic and dramatic aspects of the parts and theres a tangible connection between them. The romantic scenes vary from being sweet but not saccharine to sexy (although unlike in most lesbian romances there is no nudity). One of the reasons the two leads inhabit their characters so fully is that this isnt the first time Westfeldt and Juergensen have played Jessica and Helen. The two created their characters for the stage play ""Lipschtick"" and are simply resuming them on film. We buy into the couple so easily that on the two occasions when the screen caption ""Three months later"" appears we almost feel cheated. Yes we were interested in seeing what happens later in the relationship but we also want to observe what occurs during the three month spans. Kissing Jessica Stein is a little over one and one-half hours long but I wouldnt have minded a little longer running length. With the exception of Helens gay buddies all of the supporting characters are well developed. Leading the pack are Jessicas pushy-but-caring mother played by Tovah Feldshuh. This could easily have been a caricature (""the Jewish mother"") but the pitch of the performance as well as an attention to detail in the screenplay avoids this. Scott Cohens Josh plays an important part although not in the way that viewers initially anticipate. And Jackie Hoffman provides some added comedy as Joan Jessicas pregnant friend and co-worker. With Kissing Jessica Stein director Charles Herman-Wurmfeld easily avoids the sophomore jinx (his feature debut was 1995s obscure Fancis Persuasion). With its frank exploration of the boundaries between love and friendship the film does a lot more than the traditional lesbian romantic comedy. And while the Kissing Jessica Steins ending can be described as bittersweet the movie as a whole is a joy to experience.
