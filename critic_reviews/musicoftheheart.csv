"Meryl Streep Soars In `Music Of The Heart - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Movies.Meryl Streep Soars In `Music Of The HeartOctober 29 1999|By Michael Wilmington Tribune Movie Critic.Movies that honestly touch your heart are rare -- which is one reason among many to treasure ""Music of the Heart."" The title may sound sappy but the film itself -- which is about the real-life struggle of East Harlem music teacher Roberta Guaspari (Meryl Streep) to keep her violin class in the face of ruinous public school budget cuts -- has a wonderful spirit humanity and humor. Its a tribute to Robertas skill and tenacity of course but its also a celebration of the best teachers everywhere -- and the ways the best of them impact on our lives.The movie is also a tribute to the power of art -- and especially music -- to renew and inspire us in this case to rally Robertas East Harlem kids to rise above harsh backgrounds and dangerous streets and take control of their lives. Seeing Robertas fights first to recover from a traumatic divorce then to establish herself as a teacher and raise two boys and finally to save her highly successful class in 1990 becomes unexpectedly a thrilling spectacleIn fact I watched it with the total absorption and pumping heart I usually reserve for championship sports battles. When this battle is carried (as it was in life) all the way to Carnegie Hall -- and a benefit concert to which violin virtuosos Isaac Stern and Itzhak Perlman (among others) gallantly lend their hands and bows -- the excitement hits a magnificent crescendo.Guasparis history was already told in a sometimes wonderful little 1987 documentary called ""Small Wonders"" directed by Allan Miller (one of ""Music of the Hearts"" four producers.) That film followed the backstage story of the Carnegie Hall concert climaxing in the rousing massed performance of Bachs Double Concerto by Robertas pupils ex-pupils and guests.But ""Music of the Heart"" shows us more dramatizing Robertas life in ways both convincing and punchy. The volatile relationship between a single working mother and her sons is often botched in movies. Here Streep and the filmmakers get it right show us the tensions a perfectionist like Roberta stirs up the conflicts that tear up the family and the loyalties that mend it. The blighted love affair between Roberta and Aidan Quinns roving journalist Brian Sinclair is also well-done -- especially when it ends.I loved the scenes where we see Roberta teaching the electric and none-too-gentle interactions between tutor and pupils (especially her all-important first class). And though the school crises mostly finessed by Angela Bassett as Janet Williams (the kind of principal I wish wed had) are more conventional they get our motors racing. By the time we reach the concert in fact there has been so much turmoil its almost an anticlimax.Why does this film work so well? Partly because of master actress Streep who conveys the essence of this stubborn mother and dedicated teacher without sentimentalizing her or condescending to us.Partly its due to the fine script by Pamela Gray (""A Walk on the Moon""). Partly its the unusually good supporting cast (especially Cloris Leachman as Robertas mom and all the child actors who play Robertas students and sons). And partly its due -- wonder of wonders -- to the sturdy and sensitive direction of a veteran filmmaker we never expected would make a film like this a man more used to filling the screens with blood than with music Wes Craven of ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" and the ""Scream"" series.You may not believe that the moviemaker who began his career with the grisly ""Last House on the Left"" and later unleashed dream killer Freddy Kreuger had a heart at all (except the ones hed chewed up and swallowed). Or that he could pull off the kind of warm drama youd expect from a Robert Mulligan or an Alan Pakula. But as usual youre in for a shock. This horrormeisters ability to envelop audiences in terror and drench them with emotion turns out to be exactly right for this movie.As for Streep she proves again that like many other older American movie actresses shes a wondrous often wasted resource. Havent Streep and Susan Sarandon (also considered for Roberta) definitively blasted the old cliche about movie actresses ending their star careers at 40? At 48 Streep acts (and looks) better than ever.Her Roberta is out-and-out great acting -- which is what we expect of her. Streep gives us Robertas temper pain guts obsessive drive thorniness and idealism good points and bad. She even shows off unexpected musical skills playing no mean violin even when side by side with Stern and Perlman.A confession. In the last 20 years Cravens first ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" is the only horror movie that ever really scared me. And ""Music of the Heart"" is one of a handful of movies this year that made me cry. Ive always liked Cravens work and I consider him underrated by many mainstream critics. ""Music of the Heart"" proves my point.1 | 2 | Next MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Life Skill 201 Washing a baseball capLongtime nursing home operators must face trial judge rules10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesStreep Takes Violin Immersion Course For Role In `Music Of...October 16 1999`Small Wonders Documents Violin Teachers DedicationJanuary 17 1997Find More Stories AboutMeryl StreepCarnegie HallSmall WondersTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter",http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-10-29/entertainment/9910290003_1_roberta-guaspari-ex-pupils-meryl-streep,200,musicoftheheart2,musicoftheheart,chicagotribune

Starring Meryl Streep Aidan Quinn Angela Bassett and Gloria Estefan. Directed by Wes Craven. (PG. 130 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Some people will warm to ""Music of the Heart"" and for those people the idea of criticizing the film will be like kicking a puppy. This movie gives love wants love and is all about love. But it also drools. It barks for two hours straight and its not much fun to be around. We have seen this movie many times before. We are expected to love it each time. Now its back. It would be absurd to criticize the picture for being predictable because all movies about teachers and students -- unless theyre horror movies -- end the same way. Where ""Music of the Heart"" falls down is that its predictable in its details. The characters the encounters the emotional dynamics and the conversations all seem programmatic. Meryl Streep is the good news. She has to act opposite kids. She wears a ridiculous black wig and though in her early 50s plays a woman in her late 20s for half the film. I dont care. Ill put up with all of that for a half-dozen close-ups of Streep thinking on camera. ""Music of the Heart"" may be based on a true story but Streep is the one true thing. She plays Roberta Guaspari a military wife with two kids who is dumped by her husband. When Streep plays getting dumped she makes everyone in the audience feel it. Its like a trapdoor opens inside her and she never stops falling. A chance meeting with a friend points her in the direction of a new life. A school in East Harlem is willing to hire her as a violin teacher -- especially after she informs them that she can stake the school to the tune of 50 violins. ""Music of the Heart"" -- based on the true story of a teacher whose story was told in the 1996 documentary ""Small Wonders"" -- is not without its moments. At one point Guaspari harps on how a violinist has to ""stand strong"" only to realize that one of her students is wearing braces on her legs. Later she tells the girl that its possible to ""stand strong on the inside."" The sense Streep gives of a decent and fallible woman fumbling her way to genuine humanity is touching. But theres a canned feel about the film. It plays as if its based not on a true story but on other movies based on true stories. Bassett is the tough-but-fair principal. There is the inevitable crisis- of-confidence scene not to mention the encounter with a hostile parent who is won over by a single soaring speech. Between the scenes ""Music of the Heart"" tries to tell the story of a working mom dealing with heartbreak two kids and a tight budget. Aidan Quinn plays the new boyfriend a nice guy who wont commit. The set-up may have had some bite but director Wes Craven best known for horror movies presents the story through rosy shades. He is trying too hard to reform. Without psychos in closets to build scenes around Craven can find no rhythm. Structurally the picture seems to end in the middle and then begin again. The beginning should have been prologue or the end epilogue; instead we get two ungainly halves. Gloria Estefan appears as a fellow teacher in a role that amounts to nothing. More successfully Isaac Stern Itzhak Perlman and other violin greats make cameo appearances. Its a pleasure to hear them perform. But even at its best ""Music of the Heart"" feels more like an earnest commercial for music education than successful entertainment. ..

Horrormeister Wes Craven makes an abrupt U-turn with ""Music of the Heart"" a gloriously sentimental true-life drama in which Meryl Streep offers another indelible portrayal this time as a deserted wife who manages to make a fresh start in life by teaching violin to underprivileged kids in East Harlem. Building to a re-creation of the famous Carnegie Hall Fiddlefest in which the children played alongside such luminaries as Isaac Stern and Itzhak Perlman pic is not for cynics but if given the usual formidable Miramax marketing push is likely to perform solidly in class houses worldwide. Based on a real-life drama which formed the basis of the 1996 Academy Award-nominated documentary ""Small Wonders"" by Allen and Lana Miller ""Music of the Heart"" recalls famous and successful pics in which a dedicated teacher was able to break through to classrooms of bored or antisocial children -- think of ""Blackboard Jungle"" ""To Sir With Love"" and ""Mr. Hollands Opus"" just for starters. New pic covers no fresh ground; the dramatic arc is wholly predictable and no opportunity for wrenching emotional scenes is avoided. This will undoubtedly turn off many reviewers but the essential truth of the story validates the approach and audiences are certain to respond to the uplifting saga. In 1988 music-loving Navy wife Roberta Guaspari (Streep) was abruptly dumped by her husband who left her and their two sons ages 7 and 5 for another woman. Utterly traumatized the middle-class Roberta tearfully keeps hoping hell return until forced by her acerbic mother (Cloris Leachman) to re-enter the work force which she does as a department store gift-wrapper. There she reacquaints with old school friend Brian Sinclair (Aidan Quinn) who recalls her childhood love of the violin and arranges an introduction with Janet Williams (Angela Bassett) the principal of a school in East Harlem. Roberta proposes she teach violin within the schools music department and is even able to supply the instruments (she collected 50 child-size violins while living in Greece where her husband was based). Warned by the schools cynical music teacher (Josh Pais) that most of the kids have attention spans that dont go past do-re-mi Roberta nevertheless perseveres and before long is getting through to the youngsters. After a brief romance with Brian she moves with her boys into the neighborhood and begins to renovate a run-down old house. First half of the film culminates with a successful school concert in which even the most recalcitrant youngsters perform with style. Second half picks up 10 years later with Robertas violin classes now a successful feature in three inner-city schools. But budget cuts suddenly force the cancellation of the program and all seems lost until Robertas success story makes the newspapers and a charity concert is proposed. This event known as Fiddlefest eventually takes place at Carnegie Hall and is a standout success with the best of Robertas 98 class playing alongside some of her original pupils plus such luminaries as Stern Perlman Mark OConnor Michael Tree Karen Briggs and Arnold Steinhardt. An end title reveals the violin program was reinstated during the making of the film but will still rely on charitable donations in the future. On one level pic charts the story of a defeated woman who picks herself up from the ashes of one life and makes a resounding success of a new one. After a long gap she even starts dating again after unbeknownst to her her sons take an ad in the New York Review of Books classifieds and charming Dan (Jay O. Sanders) responds. But on another level the film is a passionate plea for the continued funding of music education seen as a vital part of a rounded teaching program. Pic also touches on race themes with the mother of a gifted black kid pulling him from the program because ""my sons got better things to do than learn dead white mens music"" an attitude firmly and in the end successfully countered by Roberta. This is a long way from ""Last House on the Left"" and the subsequent horror films so expertly helmed by Craven over the past 20 years but he obviously had his heart in the project and never misses a beat. Sequences that call for suspense (when one venue for the concert falls through will another be found in time?) are expectedly well handled but in the most intimate details and especially in the frequent scenes with the children Craven shows considerable sensitivity and a precise attention to detail. Streep who perhaps unsurprisingly claims never to have seen a Craven film before working on this one adds another real-life character to her CV. She vividly conveys the colorful approach the real Roberta Guaspari seems to have taken toward her students abusing them for lack of attention for not practicing for playing off-key -- to the point that the complaint of a mother almost ends her career. Streep who learned to play the violin for the film convinces in the numerous sequences in which shes called upon to perform and teach. Bassett is effective as the schools overworked principal who empathizes with Roberta and sincerely tries to foster the violin program sometimes against overwhelming odds. Pop star Gloria Estefan has a small role as a supportive fellow teacher and warbles the title song over the end credits. The remainder of the adult members of the cast including Quinn have relatively little to do but the children are exceptionally good with a standout performance from young Michael Angarano who plays Robertas confused older son at age 7. The final concert is a magnificent set piece and should help swell CD sales of the films soundtrack. All other credits are pro with a special nod to Peter Demings subtly nuanced camerawork.

You can see what shes going for -- the inner-city teacher as inspirational tough-love drill sergeant -- yet Streep forgets to give Roberta a softer art-loving side. The films one true angle on Roberta is a distressingly colonial one She comes into Harlem and saves all these aimless rainbow coalition kids by teaching them the glories of classical music.
