Comments Stir of Echoes Hypnotist-in-training Illeana Douglas practices on skeptical brother-in-law Kevin Bacon accidentally opening his mind to disturbing perceptions that transcend reality. Second sight helps him weather a midlife crisis but threatens to alienate his wife in this serious atmospheric character-driven supernatural drama. The conventional ghost-appeasement scenario isnt very suspenseful which may be part of the reason its so gripping. The screenplay by director David Koepp (The Trigger Effect) who wrote Snake Eyes and The Lost World Jurassic Park is based on a 1958 novel by Richard Matheson.

"Stir of Echoes | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; stir-of-echoes ) Stir of Echoes (United States 1999) A movie review by James Berardinelli Stir of Echoes belongs to one of the oldest genres of horror films the ghost story. And unlike a multitude of subpar entries that have borne this appellation over the years its mostly effective. Like all good ghost stories it understands that the intent is to build suspense through atmosphere and a strong narrative not through a barrage of sudden shocks and copious gore. In fact ghost stories are often at their strongest when they remain low key trying to develop a vague sense of disquiet rather than striving for bone-chilling scares. The reason is quite simple - most movies that attempt the latter approach fail miserably at it and end up looking campy overwrought or downright silly. The main characters are both normal likable people (the best sorts to base a story about the supernatural around) - husband and wife Tom (Kevin Bacon) and Maggie (Kathryn Erbe). Both are hard workers and with their combined incomes they can just about make ends meet for their family which includes a five year-old boy named Jake (Zachary David Cope) and another baby on the way. One night at a party Tom allows himself to be hypnotized by Maggies new-agey sister Lisa (Illeana Douglas). While shes in his mind she leaves a suggestion for him to ""open up."" This results in Tom beginning to experience paranormal experiences including seeing the ghost of a teenage girl (Jenny Morrison) in his living room. He becomes obsessed with initiating a second contact with the ghost losing his job and neglecting his friends and family in the process. Only his son understands - because like Tom Jake also has strange visions of dead people. As in his previous directorial effort The Trigger Effect director David Koepp does an excellent job of creating atmosphere. Stir of Echoes is an eerie movie; Koepp gets us into Toms unstable mindset through a series of tight closeups and distorted point-of-view shots. As a study of obsession the film is first-rate. Toms tunnel vision focuses on the ghost to the virtual exclusion of all else. Maggie desperately wants to support him but not being able to share the experience with him she is unable to understand the forces that are driving him. The two main characters (Tom and Maggie) are nicely developed. Theres a believability about them thats often absent from protagonists in this kind of movie; its easy to relate to them and they react in credible ways. The presence of a ghost frightens and unsettles them and Stir of Echoes concentrates a great deal of its attention on the pressures that Toms vision places upon their formerly rock-solid marriage. Actors Kevin Bacon and Kathryn Erbe (Dream with the Fishes) do solid jobs bringing their characters to life. Bacon is effective as a man withdrawing into himself and Erbe conveys Maggies growing desperation at her husbands strange behavior. In its tone although not in plot details or character specifics Stir of Echoes recalls a small 1996 British horror film called Haunted. Both films concentrate on building a strong atmosphere and centering the story on character development. Some will also see similarities to M. Night Shyamalans The Sixth Sense. Koepp eschews the guerilla tactics employed by most horror directors to generate a momentary scare; instead he allows the tension to grow at a slow gradual rate. In a way the climax is disappointing because it goes against the grain of this philosophy and relies on a common (and unsatisfying) plot device to wrap things up. The last ten-to-fifteen minutes of Stir of Echoes represents its weakest segment. Stir of Echoes box office success will almost certainly be determined in large part by word-of-mouth. It doesnt have the big name stars or directorial pedigree to automatically attract a crowd. The film is intelligent but not so talky or esoteric that it could be labeled as an art house attraction. And while Stir of Echoes isnt as downright disturbing as another Artisan release The Blair Witch Project its still the kind of film that may give you pause the next time you walk into a dark room by yourself.

The sleeper success of ""The Sixth Sense"" may bode well for ""Stir of Echoes"" another low-key character-driven supernatural drama with a minimum of graphic violence and an abundance of across-the-board audience appeal. Screenwriter-turned-auteur David Koepps sophomore effort as a multi-hyphenate (following ""The Trigger Effect"") is a white-knuckle thriller propelled by Kevin Bacons exceptional performance as a working-class Everyman who discovers dark secrets under his own roof after inadvertently gaining precognitive powers. Expect above-average business for this early-autumn Artisan release followed by prolonged afterlife through cable and video exposure. Ticketbuyers may flinch as ""Stir of Echoes"" begins with a hint that a la ""Sixth Sense"" plot will focus on a small boy who communicates with spirits of the dead. When Tom Witzky (Bacon) is momentarily distracted from bathing his young son Jake (Zachary David Cope) moppet calmly converses with an unseen apparition. ""Does it hurt to be dead?"" Jake asks. Shortly afterward however the focus shifts as Tom and wife Maggie (Kathryn Erbe) attend a neighborhood party. After more than a few beers the ever-pragmatic Tom is more than usually outspoken in his teasing of Lisa (Illeana Douglas) his metaphysical-minded sister-in-law. Lisa insists she knows enough about hypnosis to plant a post-hypnotic suggestion inside the mind of anyone -- even someone as stubborn as her brother-in-law. Tom dares Lisa to make good on her claim so Lisa lulls him into a trance. While hes under she encourages him to be more ""open"" in his thinking. Trouble is being more ""open"" makes Tom more receptive to bad vibes long after he reawakens. He finds himself increasingly ill at ease as he dimly perceives grave portents throughout his house which he is renting from a neighbor. Tom is especially upset by his vision of an unfamiliar teenage girl on his living room couch. Unfortunately the girl may be the spirit of a mentally challenged neighborhood girl who disappeared several months earlier. Even more unfortunately Jake may be having the same vision. Right from the start Koepp does a masterful job of grounding his intimations of the supernatural in a totally persuasive down-to-earth context. The verisimilitude is enhanced by Fred Murphys moody lensing in three different Chicago environs -- Wicker Park Polish Village and Brighton Park -- which editor Jill Savitt seamlessly weaves into a single working-class neighborhood. Canny production design by Nelson Coates adds to the believability. But the credibility quotient gets its biggest boost from Bacons shrewdly detailed performance as an ordinary guy who takes a dangerously long time to fully comprehend or even believe his extraordinary powers. A major turning point occurs when Tom and Maggie attend a high school football game to cheer a friends son. (Kevin Dunn gives a nicely ambiguous performance as the proud father.) Suddenly and inexplicably Tom becomes aware that a newly hired babysitter Debbie (Liza Weill) has absconded with Jake. But Debbie isnt a kidnapper. After tracking the babysitter and his son to a train terminal Tom discovers that Debbie simply wanted her mother to hear what Jake had to say about seeing a ghostly teenage girl in his home -- a teenage girl it should be noted who sounds a lot like Debbies long-missing mentally challenged sister. Maggie doesnt understand whats happening but she doesnt like it. And she likes it even less when she and Jake fortuitously meet a Chicago police officer (Eddie Bo Smith Jr. making the most of a small but key role) who instantly recognizes Jake as a kindred spirit. A fleeting subplot that involves an entire subculture of similarly ""gifted"" psychics gets disappointingly short shrift. On the other hand paring away nonessentials allows Koepp more time to build and sustain suspense while charting Toms increasing anxiety and reluctant enlightenment. Standout supporting players include Erbe as Toms understandably distressed wife and Cope as their innocently curious son. Douglas adds a sly touch of humor by suggesting that Lisa secretly enjoys her role in causing so much excitement. Trivia spotters take note. ""Stir of Echoes"" is based on the novel ""A Stir of Echoes"" by Richard Matheson whose books have also inspired such diverse pics as ""Somewhere in Time"" ""The Omega Man"" and ""What Dreams May Come."" Mathesons ""The Shrinking Man"" -- basis for the 1957 sci-fi classic ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" -- can be glimpsed during a in-joke on-camera allusion.

From that moment forward he is haunted by visions of an eerie gruesome cataclysm (a bloody incisor a clawing hand the world seen as a crimson X ray) that come ripping into his minds eye like images from a bad acid trip. Tom it seems isnt the only one with second sight. His little boy Jake (Zachary David Cope) converses quite casually with an unseen presence. The snazziest thing in the movie is the way the kid stares into the camera so that the audience literally shares the point of view of the uncanny. This kid who talks to ghosts invevitably recalls ""The Sixth Sense"" (the spirits here also bring frost to the air) and the coincidental motif Im afraid doesnt favor the new film. There are purplish incidents of criminality and violence as well most of which arent nearly as gripping as theyre meant to be. Take for instance the babysitter who comes over to the Witzkys home to look after Jake and in a rather overwrought scene kidnaps the boy after shes heard his otherworldly conversations. Or the high school football star who whips out a gun and puts it to use. After a while we barely need a fortune-teller to play connect-the-dots with these events. ""Echoes"" offers tricky fragmentation without mystery or mood; its a mosaic of fear that grows less and less unsettling as it comes together. The movie is based on a 1958 novel by Richard Matheson and the director David Koepp (whose screenplays include urassic Park cant do much to render material that might have seemed an exotically sinister head game four decades ago anything more than borderline banal now. In the end the movies vague title seems all too appropriate. It offers a stir of an echo of horror rather than the genuine cathartic article.

"Stir of Echoes (R) Related Items ""Stir of Echoes"" showtimes Read a feature about writer-directer David Koepp Stir of Echoes Bacon on the Edge By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday September 10 1999 Kathryn Erbe suspects Kevin Bacon has gone off the deep end in the suspenseful ""Stir of Echoes."" (Artisan) Director David Koepp Cast Kevin Bacon; Kathryn Erbe; Illeana Douglas;Kevin Dunn; Liza Weil Running Time 1 hour 39 minutes Contains graphic violence sex nudity obscenities Dont you just love Kevin Bacon playing . . . Kevin Bacon? I do. Hes cool hes taut and hes free. Whatever supporting role he gets - whether bullnecked military man or leering redneck - he makes his own. Youre always sorry when the story shifts away from his character. And sometimes youd swear hes good-looking. So its great to see him center stage in ""Stir of Echoes"" David Koepps vibrant unsettling thriller. Adapted from Richard Mathesons novel this is a movie that glides past cheap shock and chills the intelligence. Of course theres visceral horror too including a grisly image - a horror-in-miniature involving a fingernail - that located an open nerve in my jaded ability to endure screen violence. I cant walk past nail salons without intense psychological prep work anymore. Bacon plays Tom Witzky a blue-collar guy from a Chicago neighborhood who gets into a friendly baiting session with his sister-in-law Lisa (Illeana Douglas) at a party. Ragging on Lisas ability to perform hypnosis - and the subject in general - he challenges her to mesmerize him right there in front of everyone. ""Whats the worst that could happen?"" Tom asks his wife Maggie (Kathryn Erbe). When Lisa ushers him - and us - gently into the Rabbit Hole of his psychic abilities he finds out. Imagine yourself in a movie theater she tells Tom. We see a shot of a blank movie screen and the heads of a movie audience in front of it. This connects us to the story with a palpable three-dimensional clutch. Lisa tells Tom to imagine more things and soon there is silence. Darkness. A blip later Tom comes around. It isnt long before he realizes Lisa has unlocked his nascent ability to see a new realm a sort of halfway station for the hereafter where souls wander in torment. Tom tries desperately to blot out the horrifying visions including a mortifying apparition on his sofa. But nothing can stop them. Tom also learns his precocious son Jake (Zachary David Cope) has the same psychic abilities. ""I opened a door thats all"" protests Lisa when Tom begs her for help. Writer-director Koepp who wrote the scripts for both ""Jurassic Park"" movies and ""Mission Impossible"" clearly knows a thing or two about suspense. Step by step were drawn deeper into this thing with just enough to keep us in the dark and hungry for more. Koepps also a whiz in the kitchen when it comes to boiling the pressure cooker. A three-way edginess flares up at the Witzky home which almost matches Toms terrifying visions. Maggie becomes more hostile and estranged from Tom. And Jake who wants to accommodate his mothers resistance to para-reality also feels the strain of seeing too much. Bacons performance is a delight a jangled mixture of taut energy and endearing goofiness. When Tom plants himself on that sofa at one point determined to wait until the apparition returns the suspense goes from nail-chewable to hilarious. He waits and waits staring at the spot eyes darting left and right. The eye-dancing vigil begins to suggest the ridiculous ritual of the bug-bitten camper feverishly waiting for that mosquito to reappear. But this is no insect hes waiting for. And thats what keeps us going - the thought of what it could be. Or whom.

Starring Kevin Bacon. Written and directed by David Koepp. (R. 112 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) It doesnt take a sixth sense to see the resemblances between the Bruce Willis sleeper hit and the ghost thriller ""Stir of Echoes"" starring Kevin Bacon -- both feature boys who see the dead for starters. But dont push the similarities too far including the one where the temperature drops when ghosts are present and we can see peoples breath. ""Stir of Echoes"" is much more down and dirty and the thrills are more visceral. Its also more fun in a hokey over-the-top way while the classy somber ""The Sixth Sense"" makes no pretense of going that route. In the Willis film the 9-year- old boy gravely looks at the psychiatrist and says ""I see dead people."" In the blue-collar ""Stir of Echoes"" the 5-year-old boy looks at the camera with a level gaze and asks us ""Does it hurt to be dead?"" Bacon plays the boys father Tom a utility company lineman in Chicago who is beginning to realize that life has passed him by. ""I just didnt expect to be so ordinary"" he says. What happens next will take care of that. A well-meaning but witchy friend who dabbles in the psychic (Illeana Douglas) hypnotizes him at a party. Soon his mind starts playing tricks. Images come to him during lovemaking with his wife and they are not sex fantasies. He starts having red flashes. Automobile taillights freak him and so do a police squad cars flashing signal and neon signs. The movie was written and directed by David Koepp who has an impressive resume of writing credits (""Jurassic Park"" and its sequel ""The Lost World"" ""Mission Impossible"" and ""Snake Eyes""). He is an imaginative director too. When Tom goes under hypnosis the screen goes blank and we are inside his head. ""I want you to pre tend youre in a theater"" the hypnotist croons. A movie screen appears out of the darkness and starts sending him messages. The movie screen were watching will start sending us messages too. Some of the scares come out of the commonplace such as turning on a TV set or filling a bathtub with hot water. An outdoor party turns ominous. Before long Toms fantasies start forecasting reality and he sees his home stripped and empty. He is tuned into another world of ghostly vengeance and cant shut it off with a remote control. Koepps transitions from Toms fantasies to reality are slickly done. Bacons high-energy perfor-- mance as the working-class stiff driven to extremes is effective and affecting. He is lithe with a little goatee and tattoos on both forearms. Later one between his shoulder blades is revealed. As Tom becomes increasingly wiggy Bacon doesnt exactly chew the scenery but he does manically dig it up. ""Stir of Echoes"" is from Artisan the same company that made out like a bandit with ""The Blair Witch Project"" and now is emitting muffled rumblings of concern that Willis may have pulled the rug out from under it on this one. Pairs of films with similar themes come out all the time in Hollywood. A few years ago there were the two volcano movies and then the two animated bug films. Sometimes it seems as though theres something in the L.A. atmosphere besides smog and savvy moviemakers have their antennae up. Actually theres a simpler explanation. Scripts make the rounds and people talk. Good scripts with similar themes get fast-tracked and the race is on to open first. DreamWorks ""Antz"" beat Disneys ""A Bugs Life"" to the punch and ""The Sixth Sense"" beat ""Stir of Echoes."" Sometimes the first one in the theaters wipes out audience interest in the second -- ""Dangerous Liaisons"" killed ""Valmont"" a worthy film based on the same source. Sometimes the first one creates interest in the second -- Disney was not hurt by ""Antzs"" earlier release -- and that may be the case with ""Stir of Echoes"" (if people can remember its clumsy title). There is one really scary thing At one point I was sure some of the screams were coming from the soundtrack and not the audience like a TV sitcom laugh track. ..
