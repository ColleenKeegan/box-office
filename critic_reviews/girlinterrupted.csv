Starring Winona Ryder Angelina Jolie Clea Duvall Brittany Murphy Elisabeth Moss Angela Bettis Jared Leto Vanessa Redgrave Whoopi Goldberg. Directed by James Mangold. (R. 125 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Girl Interrupted"" delivers an assured finely tuned performance by Winona Ryder. In fact its got what it takes to be called a great Winona Ryder movie. But overall this look at a confused teenagers experiences in a mental hospital is a sappy muddled production that misses the jarring tone of the autobiographical book by Susanna Kaysen on which it is based. Thats not to say the film which opens today at Bay Area theaters fails to entertain. Its just that theres not much power. Related Stories Sappy `Girl Lacks Sufficient Power / Ryder does the best she can with her role Ryders sensitive performance almost saves the film but it also works against the whole. For all her intensity and brave acting her portrayal of a troubled young woman results in a character whos hard to care about. Its not really her fault -- fact is budding writer Susanna (Ryder) is never in any kind of dramatic jeopardy. Shes mixed up for a while and then shes not mixed up. Mostly shes a witness to the dire straits of other characters. But Ryder is terrific as a confused middle-class waif whos been hit on by a family friend twice her age and who sees a messed-up 60s world. Her uptight parents and a psychiatrist collude to persuade Susanna to check herself into a swanky private mental hospital in 1967 shortly after graduating from high school. In the cold confines of Claymore -- it looks more like a New England college campus than a mental hospital -- Susanna develops unexpected friendships with sister ""inmates."" Georgina (Clea Duvall) is obsessed with the ""Wizard of Oz."" Daisy (Brittany Murphy) is a spoiled brat with a dark history. Janet (Angela Bettis) is hazy and out of touch and Polly (Elisabeth Moss) is a burn victim scarred inside and out. Susanna also meets Lisa (Angelina Jolie) an acerbic rebel who keeps escaping and being re turned by authorities for more extreme sedation and shock treatments. Shes a shocking girl too -- a foul-mouthed bullying brazen seductress. The young women have a kindly warder in a nurse named Valer ie (Whoopi Goldberg). But the hospital is overseen by a cool imperious psychiatrist Dr. Wick (Vanessa Redgrave). Handsome outsider Toby (Jared Leto) wants Susanna to run away with him (why she doesnt is the movies oddest twist). Susannas intense eyes her wincing glances and brooding expression reveal the roil of emotions eating at her. Viewers will admire the actorly qualities Ryder brings to the part and the fine photography of changing seasons by cinematographer Jack Green. But ""Girl Interrupted"" never catches fire. A too-tidy calculated effort to steer the story toward a melodrama of sisterhood with comic asides keeps it light and sappy and mostly unsatisfying. Its no ""Snake Pit"" no ""One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest."" Perhaps the films biggest muddle is that Susanna is the character viewers may care about least. The films other characters are more interesting more bruised more haunting yet theyre barely fleshed out. Lisa for example is the most vital and fascinating even though Jolie pushes her to more caricature than character. Shes strident angry smart sexy and challenging. But we get little more than her brash surfaces and outbursts. Shes girl in your face. The whys and wherefores are hardly explored. ..

Based on Susanna Kaysens memoir of her experience at a mental hospital in the late 60s this moderately engaging effort imposes a detached male perspective on the authors firsthand observations. Veering from the serious to the trivial and from the clinical to the lurid James Mangolds ""Girl Interrupted"" is a middling film that only partially conveys the spirit of its source material. Based on Susanna Kaysens memoir of her experience at a mental hospital in the late 60s this moderately engaging effort imposes a detached male perspective on the authors firsthand observations. Best marketing hooks for this Columbia holiday release other than the curiosity it will provoke among fans of the bestseller are a solid central performance by Winona Ryder and a captivating wild turn by Angelina Jolie in the yarns flashiest role. Kaysens journal presents a difficult challenge for screen adaptation. Not only is it episodic and non-chronological but it integrates sharp commentary on female adolescence bourgeois family values and the abuse of authority by the medical profession. Whats missing from this film co-written by Mangold Lisa Loomer and Anna Hamilton Phelan is the authors dark humor and revelatory insights into her ordeal. Pic is unevenly structured and directed its sensibility only one notch above that of a Lifetime telepic. Confused insecure and baffled by the rapidly changing mores of American society in 1967-68 Susanna (Ryder) appears to be like many other adolescents. This is conveyed in the first-person narration that opens the tale ""Maybe I was really crazy maybe it was the 60s or just a girl interrupted."" When Susannas upper-middle class parents discover that she has taken a whole bottle of aspirin presumably to get rid of a headache they urge her to see a psychiatrist. The doctor diagnoses borderline personality disorder manifest by ""uncertainty about self-image goals types of friends or lovers to have and which values to adopt."" Without a moment of hesitation or doubt he recommends institutionalization at the Claymoore Hospital. Films focus on teen-age girls gives it a somewhat novel angle; classic Hollywood mellers about mentally ill femmes have dealt with adults usually housewives as in ""The Snake Pit"" or ""The Three Faces of Eve."" But once Susanna lands at the asylum the story toes a more conventional path. Most of the narrative is set within the confines of the ward centering on Susannas interactions and growing friendship with a half-dozen inmates who are mostly character types rather than full-blooded characters. The clique of eccentrics includes Lisa (Jolie) a charming sociopath who has spent years in the hospital with repeated escapes and returns; Daisy (Brittany Murphy) a pampered Daddys girl with an eating disorder; and the sensitive Polly (Elisabeth Moss) whose scarred face offers a sharp contrast to her sensitive heart. As expected in such tales theres a benevolent no-nonsense nurse Valerie (Whoopi Goldberg) who befriends Susanna and brings her back to reality whenever she engages in crazy (""dreamy"" as she says) conduct. Vanessa Redgrave shows up in three scenes as head psychiatrist Dr. Wick whose sessions with Susanna touch upon some of the films most fascinating issues such as societys arbitrary labeling of normalcy and insanity and its double standard regarding female teen-age sexuality. Early on Susanna is established as a girl who unabashedly loves sex sleeping with a married teacher whos the father of a classmate. Theres a good scene in which shes confronted by his wife (Mary Kay Place) in an ice cream parlor while on an outing with the other inmates. Later on Susanna gets romantically involved with Tobias (Jared Leto) a hippie whos drafted to go to Vietnam and who sees that theres basically nothing wrong with her. She also carries on with one of the hospitals employees which costs him his job. In one of the films more intriguing acts Susanna now labeled ""compulsively promiscuous"" charges back at Dr. Wick ""How many girls would a 17-year-old boy have to screw to earn the label compulsively promiscuous? And how many boys for 17-year-old girls?"" One wishes the chronicle contained more substantial scenes like this but Mangold seems content merely recording daily existence in the ward focusing on the formation of cliques and the camaraderie among the girls which were not central to the memoir. Whats more disturbing is that the film doesnt bother to explain its title which is taken from a Vermeer painting ""Girl Interrupted at Her Music."" In the published journal there are wonderful recollections of how Susanna first saw the painting with her English teacher at the Frick Gallery of the impact it continued to exert on her and of her second encounter with Vermeers work 16 years later. Mangold who made an auspicious directorial debut with ""Heavy"" disappointingly employs the same strategies that he used in that 1995 film and in his next effort ""Cop Land."" But the longueurs and deliberate pacing that were so crucial to the dissection of uneventful life in ""Heavy"" prove detrimental here (as they did in ""Cop Land"") to viewers involvement resulting in a lopsided often dull movie. Ryder is credibly cast as the rich spoiled and confused girl occasionally rising above the scripts limitations. Stealing every scene shes in Jolie is excellent as the flamboyant irresponsible girl who turns out to be far more instrumental than the doctors in Susannas rehabilitation. Redgrave and Goldberg are decent in roles that dont allow much emotional range. As befits the setting production values are unadorned particularly the visuals by Jack Green Clint Eastwoods reliable lenser who endows the story with a rough but sharp look. Richard Hoovers detailed design and Arianne Phillips tacky costumes contribute to an accurate re-creation of the late 60s highlighted by popular songs of the era.

The bad news is that you have to be a hyper-sensitive 17-year-old girl to think so. Based on Susanna Kaysens account of her late-1960s internment in a mental institution the film has its heart in the right place while being too superficial to score honest dramatic points. And Mangold not exactly the smoothest filmmaker on the planet doesnt know when to stop with the period signifiers. VIDEO Theatrical preview for ""Girl Interrupted"" QuickTime Play Real 28K 80K Windows Media 28K 80K The soundtrack contains a wealth of classic tunes everything from Simon amp; Garfunkel to Van Morrison to The Band. And theres usually a TV in the background blaring significant news stories and advertisements from the 60s. This barrage ensures that you wont forget where you are; its easier than having the era naturally bubble up via subtle verbal and visual references. One psychiatrist even has a ""Bobby Kennedy for President"" poster prominently displayed in his front yard. When you start raising posters to establish a time period -- and the campaign sign isnt the only 60s-centric placard in the film -- its time to ease up on the sledgehammer. Winona Ryder -- whos also an executive co-producer on the film -- plays the heroine a lonely suicidal teen named Susanna. Ryder is a reliable actress and she might even turn out to be an exceptional one. Its good to see her on the screen again. But her porcelain skin and doe eyes emit a natural calm thats difficult to spike with self-destructive bile. Chain-smoking Susanna is committed to the hospital after chasing a bottle of aspirin with a bottle of vodka an apparent response to her cold-hearted parents. The hospital is full of variously cracked or cracking young women who are meant to open Susannas eyes to real pain and suffering. Unfortunately the legitimate misery often takes place in another room somewhere down the hall. Even calamitous electroshock treatments are talked about rather than shown. The clear comparison here is with Milos Formans ""One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest"" (1975). Granted ""Cuckoos Nest"" is the ultimate anti-authority movie and you cant beat Jack Nicholsons performance as R.P. McMurphy. But that film like the dazzling Ken Kesey novel that inspired it establishes clear parameters for its rebellious confrontations. McMurphy is the embodiment of the free-thinking youth movement with Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher in the film) standing in for the pointlessly belligerent social order. McMurphys so-called insanity represents something larger than a mere wise guy locked up in a hospital. The standoffs between McMurphy and Ratched have a hard-hitting resonance and Keseys dark sardonic sense of humor doesnt allow for much preaching. Never promised you a rose garden Just as Dan Quayle is no Jack Kennedy Ryder is no Jack Nicholson. And Whoopi Goldberg sure as hell aint Louise Fletcher. Thats right the stern authority figure who gooses things into action is played by none other than Goldberg an actress of such mellow voice and benign grin that she couldnt provoke a Rottweiler. QUICKVOTE Would you recommend this movie? Yes go see it now Wait for the video Dont bother View Results Goldbergs character is such a font of understanding that her flare-ups at Susannas willfulness seem like mini-explosions that will quickly recede. Susanna doesnt seem all that rebellious and her caretaker doesnt seem all that uncomprehending. The therapists -- including Jeffrey Tambor and Vanessa Redgrave whos brilliant as the queen of no B.S. -- are decent enough people. You find yourself siding with the authority figures not a good thing given the period subtext. The girls in the ward (""young women"" would be closer to the truth) arent particularly well-drawn. One of them has terrible scars on her face from a childhood self-immolation while another (played by Brittany Murphy whos fairly creepy) will eat only chickens from her dads deli.

When Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder) the 18-year-old heroine of Girl Interrupted enters Claymoore hospital a psychiatric facility outside Boston she is diagnosed with the syndrome--but in fact all shes done is made a hapless suicide attempt and acted slack and mopey and lost in her somber daydreams. Her personality isnt borderline; its self-pitying and indulgent. Fortunately the film understands this. Set in 1967 and adapted from Kaysens memoir of her two-year experience as an adolescent in the throes of a middle-class crack-up Girl Interrupted is shrewd tough and lively--a junior-league One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest that never makes the mistake of portraying its protagonist as a victim-naif. Shes more like the original poster child for Prozac Nation a girl whod rather interrupt her own life even if it means going a little cuckoo than grow up. Susanna is thrown in with a turbulent gallery of disturbed young women. They range from a girl who tried to burn her own face off to one who wont eat anything but chicken from her fathers deli (she stores the carcasses under the bed). Most of the patients are harmless but Lisa (Angelina Jolie) a heartless charismatic sociopath delights in her destructive power. Jolie brings the kind of combustible sexuality to the screen that our movies in the age of Meg Ryan have been missing for too long. As Susanna and Lisa become comrades then enemies theyre like Cuckoos Nests R.P. McMurphy split in two. Susanna her misery sunk deep down is a space cadet fighting a secret war with herself and through Lisa she plays out that war. The film allows Ryder to trace Susannas gradual emergence from her ""borderline"" state as she confronts the cruel truth of mental illness. Directed with satisfying authority by James Mangold Girl Interrupted is really about the thorny neurotic underside of a contemporary young womans struggle to leave girlhood behind. By the end you feel that Ryder at long last has done that as an actress.
