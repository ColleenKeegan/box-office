Williams; Director James DeMonaco; Release Date Wide 07/18/2014; Distributor Universal Pictures Posted July 30 2014 -- 1200 AM EDT It is said that if you were to fill a transatlantic flight with 200 gorillas only one or two would be left standing when the plane touched down. The cynical Purge Anarchy which depicts the annual night of lawless mayhem in a future America presumes that we have much in common with our primate ancestors--but does so with scant traces of finesse not to mention logic in the premise. Last summers original Purge was no masterpiece but by taking place in one rich familys barricaded mansion (echoes of Edgar Allan Poes splendid ghastly The Masque of the Red Death) that movie at least tapped into a certain zeitgeist outrage over the one percents smug disdain for the underclasses. The sequel loses the big house in the suburbs--and all the satiric utilities that came with it. Set one year after the first film The Purge Anarchy spills its action into the streets of an anonymous urban city (it was evidently shot in Los Angeles) and follows five people who find themselves inexplicably huddled together. They include a fraught woman (unfortunate Kiele Sanchez) and her timid husband (poor Zach Gilford); a tough waitress (forlorn Carmen Ejogo) and her daughter (woeful Zoe Soul); and a glowering man in black (depressed Frank Grillo) with an armored vehicle. Sneaking around the city the group is hunted by both a machete-wielding motorcycle gang wearing ghoulish masks and a paramilitary squad with Rambo-caliber hardware. The heroes slash and shoot their way through the night--conveniently for them they are armed with enough ammo to take down the bad guys whose own bullets of course forever miss. For most of the film returning writer-director James DeMonaco favors gore and shock inserts of music over the edgy nasty parody for which the material seems ready made. Its only in the last twenty minutes--when the five find themselves at an auction where the tuxedo-ed elite pay top dollar to slaughter vagrants and the Barbara Bush-esque hostess waxes ecstatic about the ""delicate trigger and smoothest discharge"" of her machine gun--that he boosts the film merrily over the top. When the situation is played totally straight as it is for eighty percent of the running time the message is boring Wed all commit murder theft and anarchy if only we could. With a narrative as depressively simplistic as that we do find ourselves identifying with the characters in the movie--counting the minutes until the Purge is over.

"Search and Destroy << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous Wedded Blitz Do or DIY  Next NFL Trade Value Part 1 Facebook Twitter Print Movies Search and Destroy The pent-up frustrations of the The Purge Anarchy and Sex Tape by Wesley Morris on July 18 2014 Nobody gets to be a hero in The Purge Anarchy not for long. But the actor Frank Grillo really has something. Its not range or big talent. Its a life-size working-persons version of macho gravitas. Hes had minor parts in lots of movies that require him to wear stubble and Kevlar. Thats fair. Like Harvey Keitel and Michael Madsen hes got the handsomeness of some cops or construction workers. He could walk off the street and onto one of those calendars. In this movie hes playing a guy named Leo Barnes whom everyone calls Sergeant who roves tentatively at night around Los Angeles in an armored car. The reason is that the government in the year 2023 has let the country fall apart. For 12 hours every March society is permitted to collapse into lawlessness just as it had in the 2013 sleeper hit The Purge. People are free to kill without incrimination. The program has been sold as an opportunity to unleash and purge aggression. Really its a not terribly opaque conspiracy to further enrich the countrys arms manufacturers limit population growth and cut the unemployment rate mostly by slaughtering the poor. This apparently is news to everybody except an outfit of black radicals whose leader (Michael K. Williams in John Lennon spectacles and a beret) posts videos vowing to strike against the empire. In the meantime Sarge just appears to be looking for personal revenge. Grillo is expressive enough to seem sad as his Batmobile lurks in the shadows. His solitude doesnt last. He happens upon a woman and her daughter being hauled into a tractor-trailer by masked soldiers. He tries to talk himself out of saving them but again Sergeant is a sergeant. I could have watched him drive around an empty downtown for 100 minutes but by the time he saves those two women and a young couple (Zach Gilford and Kiele Sanchez actually married) stow away in his backseat I was ready to give up and not because writer and director James DeMonaco isnt on to something. Its that what hes on to (federally sanctioned class warfare) is often illogically executed and annoyingly acted. If Sergeants sense of vengeance has direction why not take it there straight away? Whats with the dillydally? The woman and her teenage daughter are Eva (Carmen Ejogo) and Cali (Zoe Soul). Eva works as a waitress at a diner and has just failed to get the raise that Cali was counting on. Ejogo has a strong face but over and over shes required to weep and scream and on one hilariously inconvenient occasion fall down while fleeing. Shes not allowed to be more than limp. The car of that stowaway couple happened to run out of gas just as the Purge was getting under way and theyre just as weak and needy. Theyre all talky and openly desperate for Sergeant to get them out of jam after jam (a domestic drama gone wrong the killer Mexicans around the corner the punks in the traffic tunnel driving a car with a flamethrower). Sometimes they try self-defense. Mostly its ""Please help us"" If the Paul Haggis Best Picture winner Crash were an asteroid that hit Earth The Purge Anarchy would be its postapocalypse. To be fair this is just the kind of acting -- and the sorts of characters -- you also get in OK action movies and horror-thrillers. The original Purge had Ethan Hawke defending his home from invaders and he just seemed like a bonus. Grillos stoicism is even better for the occasion. Hes sculpted from classical action-hero steel. But DeMonaco is more interested in scenarios than in stocking them with human beings. Everybody here is a backstory in a T-shirt. Its the premise thats the hook and its hook isnt terribly dissimilar from the moral apocalypse of the Saw series where sadistic contraptions were supposed to punish and sometimes repunish the bad and the evil. Normally for social commentary youd get a George Romero zombie allegory or vampires apes or Katniss Everdeen. DeMonaco throws militarization at our problems and hes not kidding. The Purge movies are envisioning dystopia run by an unseen government outfit called the New Founding Fathers of America which has a nice tea party-style ring to it. That kind of totalitarianism is supposed to be creepy. But its the closing credits that create the biggest scares. In them heavy metal blasts over reconstituted American flags with guns grenades and brass knuckles where the stripes should be. Whats being satirized is American bloodlust -- or something like that. DeMonaco seems to feel entitled to have it both ways but awkwardly -- a trigger finger that wags too. Inequality immorality and bad government might enrage these movies but they thoroughly enjoy the splatter of all blood. Its funny. Sex Tape is about a man having sex with Cameron Diaz and at no point after the video of their drunken three-hour tryst is accidentally distributed did I wonder about the videos contents. Thats only partially because the man is played by Jason Segel whose economy-size frame has been transformed into a body meant to make sense atop beneath and pretzeled with Diazs. He might have overexerted himself in preparation. All the usual athleticism in his face is gone. He looks as sad and as pooped as the movie is. Diaz and Segel are Annie and Jay married parents in the Los Angeles area whom we see humping their way through college but who as wedded grown-ups have grown clueless about sex with each other. Between his sitting near a bunch of CDs at work and her mommy-blogging from the living room theres just no time to fuck anymore. They make an intimacy appointment that leads to failed sex (how he asks have we forgotten how to do this?) which leads to Annie suggesting they make a porno which leads to an epic night re-creating the recipes from The Joy of Sex. Obviously Jay fails to properly delete the video from the iPads he donates to friends and strangers (because for implausible music-oriented reasons he goes through them the way reporters go through notebooks. This is a Sony movie that may as well be by Apple). Jay finds out only because taunting texts pop up on his phone. As he and Annie run around town trying to recall the iPads it seems clear that the movie has no idea what the joke is. Maybe its that adults have no technological common sense. This alleged crisis could have ended minutes after it began. But that would mean a movie with barely a 40-minute running time. So why not have Rob Lowe try playing an Internet nebbish who wants to buy Annies blog? Why not have Jay and Annie show up at his mansion to steal the iPad she gave him that is still in its leather case? Why does she give it to him? Why does he accept it? Because sadly we need a brutally long sequence that juxtaposes Jay running from and beating up Lowes German shepherd with Annie and her prospective employer snorting cocaine and listening to Slayer. Later theres a trip to the home of their best friends played by Ellie Kemper and Rob Corddry who wind up seeing the video and fogging up Annie and Jays car. The four of them sit in a living room and talk through various scenarios and theres not a single laugh. Its strange to watch a comedy full of talented people that does not work from the opening scene. Its like eating food and not tasting anything. Segel wrote Sex Tape with Nicholas Stoller and Kate Angelo; Jake Kasdan directed it. You get the sense they started down this road and couldnt turn around. I mean Segel went to the gym a lot. Kasdan brought us Segel and Diaz in Bad Teacher. As viciously juvenile and condescending about public education as that movie was its viciousness was itself a virtue. Sex Tape winds up doing something cynical roping in Annie and Jays kids and making pronouncements about the value of family. At one point they do so at the mercy of the owner of an adult-entertainment website played by a famous comedian. He helps steal the movie by rattling off fake porn outfits like Nutflix. Its petty theft. But its needed like water to the dehydrated. I thought Date Night would have ended the nonadventures of the bored straight white and upper middle class. But popular culture has returned to combating and exploring the doldrums of a particular kind of marriage. Just this week three cable shows -- Youre the Worst Married and Satisfaction -- started bringing more tales of the pros and cons of coupledom. Sex Tape seems to be going in a different direction. It wants a similar depiction of the hot married sex advertised in Beyonces ""Drunk in Love."" That song had a ridiculous blown-sideways ecstasy (""We woke up in the kitchen saying How the hell did this shit happen?"") that never happens in the movie. You just watch Diaz and Segel trying to reel in their sex binge and keep waiting for the purge to start.

The Purge practically cried out for this treatment from its premise alone James DeMonacos film had a big idea -- a near-future in which ""any and all crime including murder"" is made legal one night a year -- but limited its focus to an upscale familys failure to insulate itself from the government-sanctioned carnage. Now The Purge Anarchy gets down in the muck of downtown Los Angeles with the hoi polloi reveling in the free-for-all and the conscientious objectors stuck in the wrong place at the wrong time. The movie bucks the trend -- its better than the first. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The merry ensemble includes a mother-daughter duo and a youngish couple with car trouble. All four are saved from grisly ends by Sergeant (Frank Grillo) whos armed to the teeth and on an unspecified mission of vengeance on this most celebrated feared and reviled of nights. Everyone in this quintet of survivors is reluctant when he becomes the de facto guide -- Sergeant doesnt want to be slowed down and they dont know what hes doing with so many weapons. With his low-key machismo and tactical expertise Grillos performance will make you wonder why he didnt start headlining movies like this before turning 50; his is the soft-spoken kind of charisma that helped make half of the Expendables into stars back in the 80s and 90s.""Stay safe"" is everybodys mantra in the last few hours before the Purge itself begins and you understand why they say it with such dread especially as a war horn-like alarm announces the 12-hour battle royal. It signals a point of no return with menacing authority. The frenzied way people make last-minute trips to the grocery store and scramble home as the countdown nears its end makes a case for setting the inevitable third installment on any of the 364 other non-Purge days -- imagine how this night affects everything from vacation schedules and real estate to crimes of passion. Theres a chance for compelling world building here and writer-director DeMonaco has thus far opted out of exploring it.Film Details The Purge Anarchy RatingR GenreHorror Running Time104 More Info Trailer Fictional dystopias are at their most alluring to both real-world audiences and in-world residents when they carry a utopian sheen and the great facade of the Purge society is the government- and media-propagated position that the annual bloodletting serves the greater good. DeMonacos script insists that unemployment and crime are essentially nonexistent apparently thanks to this violent bacchanal but the movies make no bones about portraying the well-heeled as the only true beneficiaries of this Shirley Jackson-esque ritual. (Theyre also its most ignominious participants.) The country-club set pays the families of terminally-ill ""martyrs"" to let them murder these ailing loved ones while street gangs deliver prey for private hunting parties. Watching Sergeant and his four charges fight back against their tuxedo-clad captors is red meat for the 99% as well as fun house-mirror exaggeration of how our different financial strata shape and determine our base instincts.In their nighttime roving and casual violence the films best scenes resemble nothing so much as the undervalued Escape from L.A. The City of Angels was an anything-goes island prison in John Carpenters sequel to Escape from New York and DeMonacos vision is just as lawless (not to mention thematically blunt). A religious zealot with a megaphone picks off passersby with a rifle in the business district while a paramilitary group targets poor apartment complexes across town. Its the city as no-mans-land and Anarchy makes good on one characters nervous (and ultimately quite funny) declaration that ""Everyone goes downtown to purge.""

The futuristic idea behind the ""purge"" itself -- for one 12-hour period every year all crime is legal and cops and hospitals cant help you -- was mostly just setup The real drama lay in watching what happened when one safe secure prosperous family dared to shelter a lowly refugee fleeing from others of their ilk. It was internecine bourgeois warfare with only brief glimpses of the have-nots slaughtering each other in the streets. Apparently something stuck in writer-director James DeMonacos craw from that earlier movie because he goes wonderfully ambitious and wild with The Purge Anarchy. Now he takes us out of the gated communities of the earlier film and into those streets where the Purge is really supposed to be taking place. The opening crawl informs us that ever since the New Founding Fathers instituted this tradition ""fewer and fewer people live below the poverty line."" However the ranks of the poor are declining not because theyre moving up in the world but because theyre killing each other in the streets. Turns out the Purge is about more than unleashing ones id; its a proto-Malthusian wet dream a way to control population and cull the ranks of the dispossessed. The new story pulls in three different sets of individuals a mysterious man (the great Frank Grillo) who has armed himself for what is clearly some sort of revenge killing a bickering couple whose car has broken down (Zach Gilford and Kiele Sanchez) and a working-class mother and daughter (Carmen Ejogo and Zoe Soul) whove been assaulted in their home. Together they make their way through a world in which every form of social dysfunction has been weaponized Drunken louts look to rape and kill the women whove ignored them; the powerful select victims for their own private purges; good old boys crack open beers as they perch behind their sniper rifles; mercenaries harvest victims for others. There are murderous domestic disputes trucks full of masked and drugged-out loons revolutionaries and one crazy lady on a bridge who yells that shes doing both the Lords work and her patriotic duty ""I am the right arm of the free world and the left hand of God"" she yells brandishing her weapons. The Purge Anarchy is basically a slasher movie in which society is the deranged killer. It plays like its already a grindhouse classic -- dark dirty and disreputable. I had reservations about this concept being expanded and interrogated. It didnt seem like it could bear much scrutiny. The idea is still full of holes (though a couple of my earlier questions such as what happens to banks on Purge Night are sort of answered) but this time DeMonaco turns his film into a perverse riff on class and power in America. Hes not subtle about it either. An early scene shows a well-heeled family praying and then declaring ""Blessed be America a nation reborn"" before picking up their machetes to hack away at an old sick African-American man. And things get less nuanced from there. By the time a society matron discusses the glories of a Mauser the way she might describe a fine wine (""It has a delicate trigger and smooth discharge"") you may find yourself chuckling along at the grotesque insanity. Its okay to laugh along DeMonaco wrote the 2005 remake of Assault on Precinct 13 and one can sense more than a little John Carpenter influence in the way he mixes satire and horror old-school heroics with dystopian grime. The Purge Anarchy is a genuinely angry movie. When the good guys are yelling things like ""Get ready to bleed rich bitches"" you know youve gone through the looking glass. Of course its silly to pretend that there isnt a load of hypocrisy at the heart of such rabble-rousing entertainment If there were an actual war on the rich Hollywood itself would be reduced to a pile of ash within seconds. But its also breathtaking to watch a throwaway studio sequel break its corporate chains before your very eyes and become something thrilling and dangerous and alive.

The Purge Anarchy Movie Review (2014) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-purge-anarchy-2014,200,thepurgeanarchy6,thepurgeanarchy,rogerebert
"Purge The Anarchy | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; purge-the-anarchy ) Purge The Anarchy (United States/France 2014) July 17 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli The success of 2013s The Purge took everyone by surprise including writer/director James DeMonaco who was immediately called upon by distributor Universal Studios to pen a sequel. The result is The Purge Anarchy a story set in the same world as the first film albeit a year later. Thankfully DeMonaco is interested in doing more than regurgitating the home invasion elements that characterized The Purge. This time around he flips the tables and takes us outside into the dog-eat-dog world of the streets. The result is an action-oriented survival tale not unlike the kind of movie that Stallone or Schwarzenegger might have made back in the 80s. The biggest stumbling block remains the premise. The Purge is a social policy that has resulted in great prosperity but at a cost. Every March 22 for 12 hours criminal law is suspended. People can do whatever they want even murder without fear of legal consequences. Its a time when they can either give freedom to the ""inner beast"" or hunker down in fortified homes and ride it out. This idea is so outrageous that it makes the suspension of disbelief hurdle high. The allegorical nature of The Purge is clearer in this installment than in the first and the stabs at social commentary and satire are more pointed. In a strange way I was reminded of Schwarzeneggers The Running Man and theres a sequence in The Purge Anarchy that seems designed to pay homage to The Hunger Games. The main character an unnamed Sergeant played by Frank Grillo (last seen as one of the bad guys in Captain America The Winter Soldier) is out on Purge night with a specific purpose to enact revenge upon someone who wronged him. His plans are scuttled however when he decides to save four people who have become through a combination of bad luck and worse decisions stranded outside. They are a mother Eva (Carmen Ejogo) and daughter Cali (Zoe Soul) and a husband Shane (Zach Gilford) and wife Liz (Kiele Sanchez). The body of the film follows these five characters as they make their way through treacherous streets and subway tunnels on their way to a safe house. Along the way they discover that Purgers and victims arent the only ones in the open - the government has deployed a task force to help thin out the herd and an anti-Purge guerilla movement is active. The Purge Anarchy works best when its proceeding as a straightforward action film. The more deeply it strays into politics the more obvious the narrative seams become. DeMonaco is less than subtle and his sledgehammer approach threatens to cause blunt-force trauma. A scene involving the auction of people while effective in a surreal sort of way doesnt offer much beyond the broad stereotyping of wealthy people as arrogant ignorant and callous. Likewise attempts at character definition are feeble. Fortunately theres not a lot of that. It only takes a few lines to illuminate The Sergeants tragic past; beyond that hes an enigma - a tight-lipped killing machine with a conscience. The effectiveness of The Purge Anarchy will depend on the viewers expectations. It is better than the first film in almost every way but that doesnt mean its appreciably smarter or has appeal to those who like meat on their action-oriented bones. This is a no-frills adrenaline and testosterone-fueled outing that is as much hampered as enhanced by its political agenda. It remains to be seen whether the premise of The Purge has the capacity to drive a franchise or whether the movie-going publics beguilement by it during the summer of 2013 was an anomaly. The box office for The Purge Anarchy will determine whether these movies become an annual event.

"The Purge Anarchy exceeds original in mayhem plotting review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Purge Anarchy exceeds original in mayhem plotting reviewWriter/director James DeMonaco uses the same formula and a no-name cast to exceed his original surprise box office winner The Purge.Theres a much larger array of menacing enthusiasts of murder and mayhem including this creepy ceramic mask in The Purge Anarchy the sequel to last years surprise box office hit.By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentThu. July 17 2014Starring Frank Grillo Carmen Ejogo Zoe Soul. Written and directed by James DeMonaco. Opens Friday at GTA theatres. 103 minutes. 14A""Stay safe"" ""stay safe"" ""stay safe."" Its the mantra everyone intones to each other as the hours tick down to the sixth annual purge -- 12 hours in which all types of government-sanctioned mayhem up to and including murder -- takes place in the good ol near-future U.S. of A.Its also the mantra adopted by writer/director James DeMonaco whose modestly budgeted high-concept thriller of 2013 made close to 100 million.Article Continued BelowSo this time DeMonaco has ditched the idea of hiring a big name star (Ethan Hawke starred in the original) in favour of a whole slew of nobodies-youve-ever-heard-of. Hes also expanded the action from a monster home in a tony subdivision to an inner city L.A. setting featuring a far more varied panoply of baddies.DeMonacos script also continues to tout the whole moral dilemma thing -- is the purge a very good thing as the government suggests or is it a very bad thing? -- along with the class/race wars angle as in poor people mostly of colour are much likelier to be purged than mostly Caucasian rich people.And guess what? By cleaving to the formula that made last years film such a surprise box office success DeMonaco has actually made a better film more intricately plotted more suspenseful and ultimately more satisfying.What he hasnt managed to do so much is learn to write better dialogue or create characters that go much beyond two-dimensional. Guess what again? It hardly matters.As the story opens Latina working class mom Eva (played by Carmen Ejogo) is heading home to batten down the hatches ahead of the impending carnage along with daughter Cali (played by Zoe Soul) though she actually looks more like a younger sister.Meanwhile Liz (Kiele Sanchez) and Zach (Shane Gilford) -- a married couple in real-life -- are tootling through downtown L.A. like theyve got all the time in the world. ""Im glad we took the back roads"" Liz says an eye-rolling sure sign of trouble ahead. Because just as all the major emergency services -- police fire paramedics etc. -- are about to take a 12-hour breather so goes it for Triple A. There are at least two incidents of car trouble as plot points in the action ahead including for poor Liz and Zach an indication of DeMonacos tendency toward lazy thinking.The four are eventually thrown together on the very mean streets where theyre rescued by the enigmatic Leo (Frank Grillo) who reluctantly allows them to tag along though he has his own ominous reasons for being out and about and armed to the teeth in an ironclad muscle car.Of course the problem of hiring a no-name cast is that you tend to get generic performances though Ejogo and Soul as mom and daughter are reasonably affecting and Grillos lone wolf Leo kind of grows on you. Gilfords unsympathetic performance as Zach is sure to have the audience rooting for someone to purge him pronto. Its also worth noting that DeMonaco does a pretty fine job of assembling an inventively menacing rogues gallery of villains of varied economic circumstance as well as some niftily Mad Max-ian modes of transportation.But its the plotting including a number of unexpected twists and turns throughout that raises the film above the expected blood fest and for that we must be grateful.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Review The Purge Anarchy ups the ante and the gore - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review The Purge Anarchy ups the ante and the gore A scene from The Purge Universal Pictures A scene from ""The Purge Anarchy."" A scene from ""The Purge Anarchy."" (Universal Pictures) Review The Purge Anarchy is a somewhat better bloodier sequel to last years sleeper hit ""The Purge Anarchy"" is a good deal bloodier but also -- gulp -- a good deal better than its predecessor. Make no mistake a good ""Purge"" does not equal a good movie but the post-apocalyptic thriller is slightly more interesting because it takes itself and its menace more seriously.The first ""Purge"" the brainchild of writer-director James DeMonaco was a concentrated form of our gun-crazy times where any lunatic can buy a semiautomatic and turn it on strangers. A sleeper hit last year it clearly touched a nerve. The sequel also directed by DeMonaco stars a strong trio in Frank Grillo Carmen Ejogo and Zoe Soul. The purging or as I think of it 12 hours when ""going postal"" has the governments stamp of approval has been refined.The glorified and gore-ified home-invasion story of the original spills out into the streets in full-scale class warfare and in the process we get a better class of people to care about. Its not that the well-heeled suburban family in ""The Purge"" was horrible. But you probably wouldnt invite them to dinner either. In ""Anarchy"" the heroes are a cross section of ordinary folks. Chance will bring them together survival will bond them a lone vigilante will lead them. It was a good choice to put Grillo in that lead role; his steel jaw and palpable intensity are perfect for purge night. Read more movie reviews gt;gt;Open link Grillos Sergeant is a father using the purge to exact justice on the man responsible for his sons death. The action turns on that revenge mission getting sidetracked. Sarge just cant drive by the gang of masked men grabbing single mother Eva (Ejogo) and her teenager Cali (Soul) whose low-income apartment building made them an easy target for marauders. They represent the struggling poor. In case you hadnt guessed there is no room for subtly in ""Anarchy.""While hes doing the good deed a bickering yuppie couple played by real-life spouses Zach Gilford and Kiele Sanchez slip into the backseat of Sarges heavily fortified car. They were last-minute grocery shopping and seem nice enough but lets face it that was stupid. To be fair its the kind of stupidity that plagues ""Purge-ville.""

Back in 2010 shortly after Paramount Pictures? ""Paranormal Activity"" became a mega-hit on a micro-budget executives at the studio decided to launch a label dedicated to making more movies of this kind. (Steven Zeitchik) Meanwhile the anarchy in ""Anarchy"" is a far more structured affair. There are still plenty of random thugs but specific warring factions have emerged. Our band of innocents will encounter all of them before its over. The most likely to be center stage if there is a third ""Purge"" is a beret-wearing rebel named Carmelo played by ""The Wires"" wonderful Michael K. Williams. Hes co-opting the airwaves to encourage people to rage against the rampage sure that a government conspiracy is afoot.DeMonacos America circa 2023 is not a nice place and the villains are many. Teams of well-funded assassins in high-tech big rigs scour the streets to thin the herd so to speak -- overpopulation is an issue. Gangs in elaborate masks that echo any number of horror movie tropes run a recycling program kidnapping and selling people to be offed for sport.The rich are a really nasty bunch shelling out big bucks to purge the less privileged in various ways.The sequels bigger budget allows the killing burning and maiming to be executed as they say in living color. Despite the films drumbeat that killing other people is not the answer to the countrys problems the violence is excessive unrelenting and hard to stomach. But by building a marginally better ""Anarchy"" no doubt were in for another purge next year.Twitter BetsySharkey----------------------------The Purge AnarchyMPAA rating R for strong disturbing violence and for languageRunning time 1 hour 42 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Entertainment Reviews Column Frank Grillo Zach Gilford Kiele Sanchez The Purge Anarchy Will horror fans come back for more mayhem?

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT In a future America where all crime is legal one night each year a group of people bands together to survive. Rated R for strong disturbing violence and language. BOTTOM LINE This B-picture may be the sharpest commentary yet on the class rage simmering in America. Tough angry and funny. CAST Frank Grillo Carmen Ejogo Zach Gilford LENGTH 143 Last year James DeMonacos ""The Purge"" presented an intriguing idea What if all crime even murder were legal for one night each year? ""The Purge"" was a simple home-invasion movie starring Ethan Hawke as a suburban family man but it came with a satirical dystopian undercurrent. DeMonacos sequel ""The Purge Anarchy"" turns that undercurrent into a tsunami of populist rage class warfare and racial tension. Maybe its the dispiriting economy a national sense of upward immobility or that 700-page Thomas Piketty book proving that only the rich will get richer but ""The Purge Anarchy"" feels like one seriously ticked-off flick. Its better-made than the first -- DeMonacos writing and directing are much stronger -- and it also has the courage of its convictions. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? The year is 2023 and our new hero is Leo (Frank Grillo of ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"") an icy character looking for vengeance on Purge night. Like so many tough loners however Leo has a heart and soon hes rescued four helpless birds Eva (Carmen Ejogo) and her teenage daughter Cali (Zoe Soul) plus the bickering spouses Shane and Liz played by Zach Gilford and Kiele Sanchez. If they can make it to a friends house across Los Angeles (a tall order on any night) they just might survive. Loosely structured as a series of increasingly dire encounters with humans at their worst ""Anarchy"" really does border on anarchy. Its the first movie in years (aside from the period-piece ""Django Unchained"") to show poor blacks rising up against rich whites in a crimson-splattered fantasy of revolt. Its wealthy villains -- senators and frost-haired matrons straight from the society pages -- are vicious almost Swiftian grotesqueries. The movie also has a droll sense of humor Spurned lovers government thugs and beer-chugging good ol boys all have their reasons to purge. ""The Purge Anarchy"" is a little overstuffed and its closing moments of melodrama feel unwelcome like sugar dumped into strong whiskey. But ""The Purge Anarchy"" packs a visceral punch.

TWITTER The action takes to the streets in this sequel to last summers surprise horror hit. Theres a lot more purging going on in this inevitable sequel to last summers surprise horror hit The Purge. Expanding the parameters of the low-budget original by taking the action literally out into the streets The Purge Anarchy efficiently exploits its high-concept premise while delivering far more visceral thrills than its predecessor. Like it or not a new franchise seems to have been born. PHOTOS 15 Horror Movies That Offered the Most Bang for the Buck Set 10 years in the future the film written and directed by James DeMonaco (repeating his chores from the original) again takes place during the annual Purge a government-sanctioned 12-hour period in which ordinary citizens are allowed to commit heinous crimes with no fear of punishment. Created as a way to allow people to indulge their basest instincts so as to keep the crime rate down the rest of the year participants are urged to ""have a good cleanse"" while those seeking shelter from the nihilistic mayhem are constantly advising each other to ""stay safe."" The latter is exactly what most of the featured main characters are trying to do including single mother Eva (Carmen Ejogo) her feisty 16-year-old daughter Cali (Zoe Soul) and bickering married couple Shane (Zach Gilford) and Liz (Kiele Sanchez). The exception is Leo (Frank Grillo) a loner who outfitted with an armor-plated car and loads of weaponry heads out into the night for reasons of his own. PHOTOS Mad Mens Kiernan Shipka as the Shining Twins and Other Hollywood Horror Delights For contrived reasons too convoluted to explicate Leo becomes the reluctant and unlikely protector of the other four when they find themselves trapped outside during the violence-filled night. They not only must they avoid the various ordinary citizens participating in the mayhem including a scarily masked gang of young miscreants but also the groups of black uniform-clad paramilitary types who massacre victims with automatic weapons from the backs of huge trucks. After Leos car becomes disabled the group is forced to make their way on foot through the mean streets to the safe home of Evas employer. While the first film was essentially an elaborate home invasion thriller this follow-up more closely resembles a John Carpenter-style action movie (DeMonaco scripted the Assault on Precinct 13 remake) with its plethora of well-staged ultra-violent set pieces. And while character development is clearly not a high priority the principal figures are a generally engaging and sympathetic lot with Grillos steely Leo particularly intriguing. More interestingly the film expands on the original premise by introducing racial and class-conscious themes into the storyline Evas elderly father (John Beasley) is seen sacrificing himself in one of the more wickedly clever plot twists; a Black Panther-style group led by a firebrand insurgent (Michael K. Williams of The Wire) violently rebels against the government-sanctioned Purge; and the desperate quintet become would-be prey to a group of wealthy white people who have bid at an auction for the privilege of hunting them down. PHOTOS 14 Horror Films Inspired by Real-Life Events While the film would have gained resonance if these provocative ideas had been developed more fully it works well enough on its own terms with Grillos commanding turn anchoring the proceedings. Director DeMonaco fills the screen with arresting images--a flame-engulfed bus seen barreling down the street in the background is particularly haunting--and keeps the pacing brisk enough to prevent dwelling on the plot contrivances. Effectively adding to the tense atmosphere is Nathan Whiteheads excellent electronic music score.

Theater Lagoon. Zach Braff follows his hit directing/screenwriting debut ""Garden State"" with a sit-commy misfire. Braff stars as Aidan Bloom a struggling actor frustrated by strained finances family responsibilities a distant father and an even more distant God. When his ailing dad no longer can pay the tuition at their yeshiva Aidan tries his inexpert hand at home-schooling his kids. The film features winning performances from Kate Hudson Mandy Patinkin Josh Gad and Braff himself but his screenplay saddles the cast with syrupy material and pointless fantasy special effects. Theres a valid comedy-drama in the story of a man who cant tell if his lifelong ambition is a true passion or a pipe dream but Braff prefers facile life lessons and slow-motion hugging to tough questions. COLIN COVERT VENUS IN FUR [?][?][?]1/2 out of four stars Unrated nudity. In subtitled French. Theater Edina. Focus Features Zach Braff right plays a struggling father of two children (Pierce Gagnon left and Joey King) in ""Wish I Was Here."" Like ""Carnage"" ""The Pianist"" ""Rosemarys Baby"" and more Roman Polanskis latest is a creepy exploration of claustrophobia and perversity that should not be missed. His psychological horror-comedy is set in a deserted Paris theater during a wild thunderstorm. Vanda a trashy actress (Mrs. Polanski Emmanuelle Segnier) auditions for a stage version of the 19th-century novel that put masochism on the map. Her director Thomas (the superb French actor Mathieu Amalric) is a pretentious fusspot who may identify with the storys submissive protagonist a bit too closely. The try-out gradually shades into a power struggle with each party jockeying to assert control. Polanski sees the eternal battle of the sexes as a cosmic joke of unfathomable cruelty. Amalric who bears an uncanny resemblance to the director in his younger days is the jests walking punchline a puffed-up snob who cant imagine himself being outmaneuvered by a brassy actress. Segnier whose character is much more than she seems plays on several levels at once shifting smoothly from unforced naturalism to wild histrionics. She keeps viewers guessing. Is she an aspiring bit player a private investigator a Roman goddess crossing the centuries for revenge? The film handles its dark themes with lighthearted ease and Polanski uses the theaters confines to establish his own world and rhythms. C.C. THE PURGE ANARCY [?][?]1/2 out of four stars Rating R for strong disturbing violence language. American gun culture meets social Darwinism with the Purge an anarchic annual holiday that sanctions any act of aggression ""up to murder."" In his sequel to last years surprise hit returning writer/director James DeMonaco combines potent action sledgehammer political allegory and eerie paranoia in an entertaining B movie. Aggressive types save up for fancy firearms and take to the streets. Most of the people stay home and close their shutters like Transylvanian villagers. An unlucky few -- here a white couple Zach Gilford and Kiele Sanchez and black mother-daughter Carmen Ejogo and Zoe Soul -- find themselves in the crossfire. Theyre reluctantly aided by stubbly bicep-y Frank Grillo prowling the streets in a Mad Max muscle car on a mission of personal vengeance. DeMonaco gives us the expected street gangs and wealthy psycho dilettantes who prefer to shoot fish in deluxe barrels. But he also boomerangs us with outbursts that hit from unexpected angles. The suspense keeps you hunkered down in your seat. ""The Wires"" Michael K. Williams plays a militant whose followers fight back though their counterattack feels like a Purge wearing a fig leaf of justice. In the films mythology the Purges have been going on for nine years and the sequels promise to last about as long. C.C. HELLION [?][?] out of four stars Unrated Violence and for language. Aaron Paul and Juliette Lewis are the nominal stars of Kat Candlers gritty indie drama but the best moments belong to 14-year-old newcomer Josh Wiggins. He plays the troubled son of Pauls character a single dad construction worker whose efforts to build a better life routinely collapse. Wiggins plays angry rebellious and emotionally closed-off very well. The boy throws himself into violent meaningless physical activity to work out his resentful impulses and hes getting into serious scrapes with the law. Hes got talent as a motocross rider and he dreams of graduating from the amateur circuit. His skills are wobbly though and the pack of little hooligans he hangs with are an anvil tied to his ambitions. Wiggins gives the boys struggles a raw realism but its not enough to shore up this slackly paced slice of sunbaked Texas miserabilism. C.C. PERSECUTED [?] out of four stars Rating PG-13 for violence and thematic elements. Justin Lubin / Universal Pictures ""The Purge Anarchy"" ""Persecuted"" is a confused and confusing thriller about a TV preacher ruined by a sinister government plot. Written and directed by Daniel Lusko who has Christian documentaries among his credits and having ex-Sen. Fred Dalton Thompson R-Tenn. and Fox News personality Gretchen Carlson in its cast you can guess its politics. John Luther (James Remar) is an ex-drug addict who now leads a Christian crusade. Sinister Sen. Donald Harrison (Bruce Davison) is pressuring Luther to endorse the Faith and Fairness Act which seems to be some sort of religious tolerance / equality law that will give all religions equal standing and all religions equal access to adherents to other faiths. Luther isnt having it. But hes been warned. Luther is forced to go on the lam. Theres no urgency to the performances no ticking clock to Luthers desperate bid to clear his name. Remar a fine character actor is utterly miscast as a preacher. He doesnt have the pulpit presence. This slapdash script fails to articulate its basic complaint or identify who exactly is persecuting them. Government? The culture? Liberals? Humanists? Jews? U2s Bono?

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Michael OSullivan July 17 2014 The sequel ""The Purge Anarchy"" takes place in 2023 exactly one year after the action of ""The Purge"" a violent thriller that imagined an America so beset by violent crime that the government has instituted an annual holiday from law and order. Over the course of 12 therapeutic hours from sundown to sunup ""purgers"" are allowed -- nay encouraged -- to rape murder and pillage with impunity. Its good or so the thinking goes to evacuate in one cathartic upchuck all the hostility that we -- or at least some of us -- carry around for the rest of the year. Its an interesting premise. The assumption that we are really beasts wearing masks of human kindness gave the 2013 film an infusion of fizzy if somewhat fuzzy-headed pop psychology. The criminals in the first movie wore Halloween masks but its our own smiling faces that movie argued that are false. The sequel takes the idea even further positing the ritualized violence as a manifestation of class warfare. In the first movie it was the wealthy -- represented by the family of businessman Ethan Hawke -- who were the victims. In ""Anarchy"" its the have-nots who are being hunted by the haves. But some of those have-nots are fighting back including five average citizens caught outside during the Purge. Led by a heavily armed antihero with murky motives (Frank Grillo) a young couple (Zach Gilford and Kiele Sanchez) and a mother and daughter (Carmen Ejogo and Zoe Soul) find themselves trapped between a group of violent psychos on the one hand and a team of black-clad commandos on the other. Both hunting parties wear masks disguising not only their identities but also their true motives which as it turns out have more to do with the maintenance of the economic status quo than with the elimination of unhealthy emotion. This attempt to tap into lingering rage over the financial crisis and income inequality is understandable if heavy-handed. As the five fugitives flee from their pursuers they pass the bloody body of a investment banker strung up on the facade of his workplace. Its a ""bad joke"" as one of them notes and he isnt wrong. Though that grisly sight gag -- if thats the right word for it -- elicits a nervous laugh from the audience its point is clumsily made. In general thats the problem with the whole film which substitutes an almost cartoonish level of violence for what at least passed for social commentary in the original ""Purge."" That movie was bloody and had a high body count too but it made its point with metaphorical skewers not machetes. Theres an even more fundamental flaw with ""Anarchy."" If youve seen the trailer you already know that its villains are the one-percenters the monied oligarchs who in the films dystopian vision round up the underclass and slaughter them for sport. This of course makes no economic sense since killing your own workers is an even stupider business strategy than underpaying them -- and a sure-fire path to the poorhouse. The film defies one of the fundamental rules of capitalism Exploitation of the proletariat may be well and good but dont execute them all. At the same time ""The Purge Anarchy"" obeys a cardinal law of Hollywood Shoot first and ask questions later.  R. At area theaters.

This sequel The Purge Anarchy ( 1/2 out of four; rated R; opens Friday nationwide) takes the action outdoors and into ballrooms and makes it more unsettling.When the film opens dutiful citizens who dont take part in the annual night of government-sanctioned mayhem nervously tell co-workers to ""stay safe"" as they head home to hunker down. Its clear however that the ""New Founders of America"" government wishes fewer folks battened down the hatches. Those in charge urge folks to ""release the beast"" and indulge their worst impulses.USA TODAYHorror movies under a frightful spell at box officeUSA TODAYThe latest movie reviewsIn this new world order Americans are given one 12-hour period to get away with murder-- without repercussions. The concept is sold to the populace as a night to let off steam while the rest of the year is marked by order. But the insidious subtext is that the yearly killing sprees are the ruling class way to thin the herd.Writer-director James DeMonaco sets the story in the near future when crime has been nearly eradicated. It turns out the Purge is even more nefarious than it sounds. Essentially its a government conspiracy targeting the poor and disenfranchised. Government death squads are out en force augmenting the body count. Rich white folks attend elegant galas well-armed and bid to kill the less fortunate for sport. Their target is largely poor people of color.Dystopia-themed movies are everywhere these days from The Hunger Games franchise to the new Planet of the Apes chapter. Each of these films focuses on a populace grappling with issues through violence. Its all a reflection of course of the times in which we live. But none of these movies offers any solution or palliative to the grim reality. Consequently theres an exploitative quality that undermines the potency of the message.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare The Purge Anarchy follows the same principal as the first movie where all crime is considered legal for 12 hours including murder. This leads to a terrifying night for one couple stranded by car trouble. VPCAnarchy features more in-your-face commentary about class warfare. A vocal and organized minority seeks to upset the status quo and wrest control from the callous elite.The film is at its best when it focuses on the more specific conflicts of five people thrown together on Purge night.Eva (Carmen Ejogo) and her teen daughter Cali (Zoe Soul) are locked in their apartment when they become targets of what looks like an army. On-the-rocks couple Shane(Zach Gilford) and Liz (Kiele Sanchez) have car trouble and are menaced by a group of mask-wearing thugs.USA TODAYUSA TODAYs guide to summer moviesThe four want no part of the bloodfest but find themselves trapped as killers lurk snipers take aim and anarchists do their worst. They are protected reluctantly by Sergeant (Frank Grillo) a vengeful guy of few words and many guns. The five do their best to dodge bullet sprays and avoid immolation and other sorts of torture.The mysterious brooding Sergeant has retribution on his mind but he cant quell his innate sense of decency to help the defenseless. The five band together and try to make it through the night in one piece.While the film is rutted with plot holes lapses in logic and tin-eared dialogue -- the obvious is stated again and again -- it falls squarely into a category that used to be called B movies. The jarring action and outlandish premise of a lawless free-for-all are somehow riveting and inane in almost equal measures. 197 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1mS42XM",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/07/17/purge-the-anarchy-review/11407883/,200,thepurgeanarchy16,thepurgeanarchy,usatoday

Johnson kjohnsonpost-dispatch.com 314-340-8191 Kevin C. Johnson Jul 17 2014 (...) ""The Purge Anarchy"" ""The Purge Anarchy"" ""The Purge Anarchy"" ""The Purge Anarchy"" ""The Purge Anarchy"" Characters repeatedly saying ""stay safe"" and ""release the beast"" can mean only one thing Its time for another ""The Purge"" movie.The original ""The Purge"" was a surprise low-budget success last year that grossed 64 million ensuring a sequel in the form of ""The Purge Anarchy.""The disturbing idea behind ""The Purge"" is that in the not-so-distant future of 2023 all crime is legal for one night only. This annual government-sanctioned holiday leads to shockingly low crime and poverty rates the other 364 days of the year thus supposedly making it all worth it. The family in the first movie barely survived the purge intact after their secured home was invaded by masked marauders ... and a few spiteful neighbors.That film was set entirely in the home a home invasion movie with a great premise.""The Purge Anarchy"" opens up the sick and savage proceedings. Its a year later and the original characters are nowhere to be found (though one character from the original puts in a noteworthy cameo). Moments before the latest purge is about to begin folks in downtown Los Angeles are preparing in various ways. Folks lock themselves in their homes guns by their side. Hustlers sell illegal weapons. The rich ""buy"" the vulnerable sick or elderly giving them big bucks to sit center stage at their elegant parties to be slaughtered in front of guests.Mother and daughter Eva and Cali (Carmen Ejogo and Zoe Soul) are in their apartment with minimal resources. Young couple Shane and Liz (Zach Gilford and Kiele Sanchez) have a car that breaks down stranding them. And mysterious Sergeant (Jack Grillo) hits the streets heavily armed to settle a score. The three groups bump into each other on a dark street and band together while the bloodthirsty pursue them.Like the first movie ""The Purge Anarchy"" is trash masking as social commentary and its depiction of unrelenting sanctioned violence can be hard to stomach. But for this viewer who is bored with soaring superheros transforming robots time-traveling mutants and Melissa McCarthy ""The Purge Anarchy"" is a dirtied-up breath of fresh air an old-school exploitation movie that does what it sets out to do.What ""The Purge Anarchy""  Two and a half stars out of four  Rated R  Run time 143  Content Strong disturbing violence and for language Kevin C.

From left Frank Grillo Zoe Soul Carmen Ejogo Kiele Sanchez and Zach Gilford.(Photo Universal Pictures)Story HighlightsCritics review 2 starsAre you a good gun-toting vigilante or a bad gun-toting vigilante?There are no real surprise answers to that question but many varying degrees of the latter in ""The Purge Anarchy"" writer-director James DeMonacos sequel to his surprise B-movie hit from last year.Despite its laughably implausible premise -- in a near-future dystopia all laws are suspended one night a year in a cathartic release of legalized violence -- the original racked up nearly 90 million at the box office making a follow-up inevitable.AZCENTRALSummer movie guide 2014 releasesEven without a slumming Ethan Hawke who starred in a sci-fi thriller you might describe as ""Panic Room"" meets ""The Hunger Games"" youd expect the sequel to be an improvement based on production values alone and you would be right but not by much.For ""Anarchy"" DeMonaco drops the ""Panic Room"" but throws in some ""Mad Max"" ""V for Vendetta"" and even a little ""Malcolm X"" for good measure with an ensemble cast that brings four mostly helpless bystanders (a mother and daughter and a squabbling couple) under the protection of a mysterious would-be Purger played by tall dark and handsome Frank Grillo (""Captain America The Winter Soldier""). Together they fight through a phalanx of baddies in downtown LA that includes a menacingly masked motorcycle gang and a mysterious fleet of semi trucks seemingly packed with an entire private army.AZCENTRALAll the reviews Weekend movie guide for PhoenixBased on body count alone youd have to call it a topper. Meanwhile Michael K. Williams -- the talented actor who portrayed scar-faced Omar Little on HBOs ""The Wire"" -- turns up as a dissident leader railing against the neo-fascist regime known as the New Founding Fathers. He rouses a good rabble as part of a half-hearted attempt to turn ""The Purge"" into cultural commentary but its not enough to make this grim vision of 2023 more convincing or compelling.Even if its true that many of us harbor secret fantasies of going on a murderous rampage (which hardly seems likely) its not just fear of the law that prevents us from doing so. Its self-preservation. ""The Purge Anarchy"" never seems to run out of cannon fodder such as the flamethrower-wielding dune-buggy gangsters who make a brief incendiary appearance in a subway tunnel but one thing the movie makes gobsmackingly clear is that when the only law is the law of the jungle it doesnt matter how big your gun is. Theres always going to be a guy with a bigger one.Indeed that may be the entire point but if so it only makes the premise all the more preposterous and the unimaginative gun porn all the more hypocritical.It is of course possible to critique our cultures obsession with violence while simultaneously indulging in it but many a better director than this one has tried to walk that fine line and failed. DeMonacos name may end in a vowel but that doesnt make him a Coppola Scorsese or Tarantino.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare The Purge Anarchy follows the same principal as the first movie where all crime is considered legal for 12 hours including murder.

The title may imply heightened scope and stakes but only the premise is out of order in ""The Purge Anarchy"" a swiftly delivered surprise-free sequel to 2013s economical sleeper hit. Moving out of the home and into the streets writer-helmer James DeMonacos noisy follow-up shifts genre gears slightly largely abandoning domestic-invasion horror for an urban-thriller template that notionally expands on the first films sketchy class satire. Success however has bred self-seriousness in this probable franchise as ""Anarchy"" uses an expanded running time to pontificate emptily on the sociopolitical implications of its still-ludicrous allegorical setup -- a future America in which all crime is legalized for one night a year -- at the expense of any whopping B-movie jolts. Nevertheless considering the scarcity of comparable genre fare in theaters plus the first films growing profile in ancillary this nasty annual event is probably good for at least one more year. Interestingly ""The Purge"" opened tepidly in Blighty before landing with a bigger bang in the U.S. where the home audience evidently found its Occupy-era state-of-the-nation subtext more resonant -- at least to the tune of 64 million a figure 20 times larger than its budget. From that outcome DeMonaco and his producers (who still include Michael Bay and ""Paranormal Activity"" enabler Jason Blum) have smartly concluded that the originals high concept was what drew crowds and have upped the America-centric social panic in the new films script.  The purse strings meanwhile appear to remain tight as befits a film that superficially opposes One Percent excess. The first films moderate star power for one thing has been dimmed further Only one member of the original ensemble (led by Ethan Hawke a casualty of the previous Purge) remains while fine character actors Frank Grillo and Carmen Ejogo take the lead. That concept however remains as much a sticking point as it is a selling point -- suitable for lurid exploitation fare but undermining the credibility of DeMonacos creation as the extreme social tract it clearly wishes to be. The notion that even the most irresponsibly right-wing American government would sanction an annual bout of mass public carnage is so patently absurd particularly without any surrounding dystopian context in the ""Hunger Games"" vein that ""Anarchy"" seems unlikely to sound a chord of genuine alarm in most viewers. Likewise the intended moral debates set up by this nightmare scenario (which here include the eye-for-an-eye vigilantism of a grieving parent) seem similarly facile in a narrative built on such distant hypotheticals. There are cinders here of the reactionary political curiosity that burned through Christopher Nolans ""Dark Knight"" films but the real-world parallels are dubious at best. Rather than focusing on one domestic unit affected by the Purge -- now in its sixth year we are told -- DeMonaco divides his attention among five characters some more carefully etched than others. The most convincing and sympathetic of them are hard-up single mother Eva (Ejogo) and her teenage daughter Cali (Zoe Soul one to watch) whose plans for quietly surviving the night indoors take a grim turn when they discover that Evas elderly father has sold his life to an organization that arranges private Purging parties for the wealthy -- a grotesque extension of the films argument that the Purge was initiated in the interests of redistributing wealth upward. When Eva and Cali are captured by a masked gang of Purgers its left to enigmatic lone-wolf gunman Leo (Grillo) to rescue the women and shepherd them to safety through the death-ridden streets of Los Angeles. Leo as we already know and Eva eventually surmises is a police sergeant out for revenge against those responsible for his young sons recent death. The trio are joined in their long nights journey into day by a stranded bickering couple (Zach Gilford and Kiele Sanchez) who have been tormented by the same ominous gang and seem sufficiently indistinct in their characterization to be an easy bet for first-casualty pundits. Quite why these particular individuals have been targeted is never explained in the script; that they wind up in the same car is a handy dramatic convenience. It is refreshing however to see DeMonaco flip the demographic focus from the first film While a privileged white family took centerstage there here its a pair of working-class African-American women who are presented as the audiences primary point of identification further enabled by the wonderful Ejogos weathered warmth and quiet intelligence qualities that shine through an underwritten increasingly passive role. The background presence of a group of militant black anti-Purgers led by charismatic intellectual Carmelo (Michael K. Williams) makes further gestures toward an expanded cultural outlook for the franchise though allusions to the Black Panther Party dont extend beyond the cosmetic. For all the philosophical and metaphorical shortcomings of his script however DeMonaco is an efficient orchestrator of action. Working once more with cinematographer Jacques Jouffret (who shoots the City of Angels with a grainy gold-flecked sheen that recalls Paul Haggis oddly indirectly comparable ""Crash"") DeMonaco keeps the proceedings at a consistently discomfiting level of tension even if the films arsenal of shocks is as limited as its weaponry is shudderingly diverse. Of particular note in the technical department is the sound team including veteran mixer Willie Burton whose rattling panoply of shrieks sirens and gunfire deliver more than the film itself on the chaos front.

Perhaps both groups have the same goal in mind or work for the same higher-ups but theyre definitely different. Reply Johnny Mack says April 2 2015 at 1036 am what special effects were used? Reply Wayne Houle says July 19 2014 at 348 pm I hope it does great. I like the movies and its premise. People think to much into the story whether it could actually happen and what not but really its just a fun ""what if"" film to watch. Thats it. I saw it last night and loved it. It was alot of fun to watch.

Photo AP/Universal Pictures MOVIE REVIEW The Purge Anarchy Running time 103 minutes. Rated R (profanity violence). At the Empire the Kips Bay the Union Square. Ive read ingredients labels that were scarier than ""The Purge Anarchy"" a plodding horror flick that mistakenly thinks it has big ideas. Its 2023 when a ruling NRA-like political party has replaced the olive branch on the national seal with an assault rifle and established a single night when all crime is legal. (Wouldnt people be looting jewelry stores instead of thrill-killing one another?) Five random citizens find themselves exposed on the street trying to keep alive during Purge night. One is a well-armed soldier (Frank Grillo); two are a whiny boring couple (Zach Gilford Kiele Sanchez); two others are equally bland mother-and-daughter lambs (Carmen Ejogo Zoe Soul) who represent the suffering underclass. They spend most of the movie creeping around the darkness exchanging gunfire with Purge-loving hooligans. The technical term for the cinematography is I believe ""black sock placed over camera lens."" Each dull character is barely discernible in the murk. Zoe Soul and Carmen Ejogo star in ""The Purge Anarchy.""Photo AP/Universal Pictures The villains in this sequel -- as they were in last years slightly more watchable original -- are pearl-wearing dowagers and floppy-haired preppies the Muffys and Bradleys from the Greenwich Polo Club. Not exactly scary nor do they have much in common with the NRA unless the latter start hosting art-gallery openings and chardonnay tastings. James DeMonaco the deeply confused writer-director of both ""Purge"" movies cant decide whether Purging is a good thing -- whether it would be exploited by the poor (yay) or the rich (boo). Though DeMonaco announces the Purge as a way a conservative-nightmare society would cleanse itself of the underclass this satiric trope is so beyond farfetched -- the rich would just cower behind security gates -- that he repeatedly finds himself slipping into examples of how the poor would use the Purge as a legalized uprising. Early on a Black Panther-like radical (Michael K. Williams) takes to the airwaves to protest Purge night which he calls a means for redistributing income from the poor to the rich. Er how does that work? ""Stick em up Hand over the 43 cents in your pocket"" The revolutionistas show their contempt for the Purge by being even more violent on Purge night than the Ralph Lauren models that are supposedly the problem. And theres a scene in which a stockbroker is shown strung up for raiding pensions. So isnt the Purge the one night when the proletariat can achieve justice? Never mind. The only plot connected to this movie that makes sense is the story of its making Its a means for redistributing income from poor ticket buyers to rich Hollywood types by selling the former the attractive lie that their problems are somehow the fault of the wealthy.

Share Tweet James DeMonacos The Purge was a meager home-invasion thriller gussied up with hints of dystopian sci-fi in which a suburban family tried to fend off intruders in the midst of a government-sanctioned killing spree. Its more substantial sequel The Purge Anarchy retains the originals premise and politics but actually puts them to use Instead of limiting itself to a single location the movie follows a group of characters as they try to cross an L.A.-like everycity dodging masked machete-wielders rich sport-killers and government death squads along the way. While Anarchy shares the first movies tin ear for language (no English-speaking government would call itself a ""regime"") and sloppy sense of action it nonetheless deliver the classic genre thrill of watching archetypal strangers band together in order to get from Point A to Point B. Anarchy is set in the near future years after the U.S. has instituted a social policy which decriminalizes murder for 12 hours once a year. Though The Purge struggled to make much of this premise its sequel finds writer-director DeMonaco bursting with ideas ""Martyrs"" who allow themselves to be killed in exchange for a large pay-off to their families; futuristic Black Panthers who take up arms once a year to defend poor neighborhoods from the marauding rich; street gangs boarding decked-out party buses to cruise through town shooting everyone they see; the super-wealthy rounding up stragglers and then holding charity-auction-style galas where bidders win the chance to track human prey in a private indoor hunting ground. With every new scene it feels like as though the characters have wandered into a different high-concept exploitation movie. DeMonaco has a clear affinity for the B flicks of yesteryear though he never manages to match their sense of style. (An early driving scene in which every widescreen composition contrasts sharp metal and soft bokeh comes close.) Hes better with characterization the best example being the nameless man in black who becomes the groups leader--played more or less perfectly by Frank Grillo whose weatherbeaten face and croaky voice brings to mind Lance Henriksen in his prime.Theres a refreshing simplicity to the way Anarchy structures its central group. The other members--waitress Eva (Carmen Ejogo) and her daughter Cali (Zoe Soul); married couple Liz (Kiele Sanchez) and Shane (Zach Gilford)--are motivated only by survival which means sticking together. Grillos character--the only one participating in the Purge by choice--is motivated for most of the movie by a sense of obligation to protect them. (Arguably the final scenes reveal too much about his character but you cant have everything.) This puts the focus for better or worse on the groups journey across the city a succession of exterior threats that range from inspired--like an argument in a safe house that erupts into violence--to half-baked. The movies inconsistency contributes to its throwback feel; classic drive-in B-movies were rarely good all the way through.

That there was a half-day holiday in which anything --any act of violence of vengeance no matter how heinous -- was permitted? Well then people who put out pictures like ""The Purge Anarchy"" really might have something to worry about. The film is a followup to the cheap (and extremely profitable) film from last year which posited the idea of an annual guiltless orgy when the entire nation let off steam -- and then some of the raging revelers decided to besiege Ethan Hawkes McMansion. It was not a particularly bright film -- why bother with an officially sanctioned free-for-all in a nation where few people seem to have any impulse control anyway? -- but at least it was short and had a certain claustrophobic unity of place. This new movie makes the ideas a little clearer (or at least simpler -- its a 1%-vs-the-rest deal) but then pads out the running time and the plot with more dull characters and a tired cross-city journey while amping up the meanness the ugliness the crudity. Sounds like a great night at the movies doesnt it? It was for some at the screening I attended where scenes of bad people getting killed by not-quite-as-bad people were met with scattered cheers. But this is a movie that confuses suspense with shock drama with violence and catharsis with simple sadism. Frank Grillo is an unnamed man with his own not-very-mysterious urge to purge; Carmen Ejogo and Zoe Soul are the plucky mother and daughter he encounters along the way and reluctantly agrees to protect. Other people pass in and out of the plot. But the characters are simplistic as are the conflicts -- not just rich against poor but often white against black and brown. Stereotypes are not only indulged (spitfire Latinas angry African-Americans plutocrat Caucasians) but encouraged. At times in fact it seems as if Grillo is only there to give the filmmakers some plausible deniability on race-baiting Wait no but our heros an Italian guy The first ""Purge"" dealt with race too and often crudely but at least it didnt have scenes of millionaires bidding on poor ready-to-kill ""martyrs"" as if they were slaves -- or of black militiamen with automatic weapons massing to mow them down. Nor was it shot so haphazardly that some fight scenes looked as if the actors werent beating up each other but the cinematographer. (And honestly who could blame them?) Director James DeMonaco made the last ""Purge"" too and has already announced his interest in a third. Consider yourself warned. ""The Lottery"" without the poetry ""Death Wish"" without the Bronson ""The Return of the Archons"" without the Archons its just nasty and brutish. And unlike the first film its not even short. Ratings note The film contains gory violence strong language and sexual situations. The Purge Anarchy (R) Universal (103 min.) Directed by James DeMonaco. With Frank Grillo Carmen Ejogo. Now playing in New Jersey.",http://www.nj.com/entertainment/movies/index.ssf/2014/07/the_purge_anarchy_review_violence_for_the_sake_of_violence.html,200,thepurgeanarchy22,thepurgeanarchy,nj

(Justin Lubin/universal) BY Jordan Hoffman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday July 17 2014 200 AM Title The Purge Anarchy Film Info With Frank Grillo Kiele Sanchez. A group of innocents try to survive a night where social order is suspended. Things go bad. Director James DeMonaco (143). R Violence language. Area theaters. If you missed last years low-budget horror-thriller hit ""The Purge"" dont worry about feeling lost with this years new awful ""The Purge Anarchy"" This isnt a traditional sequel so much as a separate story set in the same world. In a near-future America a new government has risen promising a violence-free country with one exception during an annual ""cleansing"" ritual law and order take a 12-hour hike as citizens are allowed to loot rape and kill without legal consequence. The first picture (which starred Ethan Hawke notably absent here) showed us an upscale home invasion the new ""Anarchy"" tries for a ""Warriors""/""Escape From New York"" vibe as it follows five people trapped in the streets. Returning writer/director James DeMonaco establishes the initial chaos and insanity but then his set-pieces are strangely dull. Frank Grillo (""The Grey"" ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"") maintains a degree of charisma as he portrays the groups leader the only one purposely out on ""Purge Night"" for an act of arguably justifiable vengeance. The other performances are as ineffective as the script. But even worse the films ""What if?"" scenario takes the germ of an interesting social-science idea and lets it rot in a nasty ethically questionable cesspool of junk cinema. The whiff of pulpy sci-fi isnt enough to hide what is basically ugly nihilistic stuff meant to whip audiences into a vicarious blood lust. The storys lazy attempt at condemning mans darker impulses makes this one long moral mess. Masked marauder in ""The Purge Anarchy"" (universal) On a mobile device? Click here to watch video.
