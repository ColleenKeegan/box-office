But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

"The many loves of Love Actually. Slate Sign In Sign Up The many loves of Love Actually. The many loves of Love Actually. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 7 2003 115 PM Everyone Says I Love You The many romances of Love Actually. By David Edelstein Love is all around and around and around ... Richard Curtis the writer and director of Love Actually (Universal) is brilliant at many things but his genius I submit is for thrusting characters into situations in which they feel driven to humiliate themselves. He is the Bard of Embarrassment. As he proved in his scripts for Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994) Notting Hill (1999) and Bridget Joness Diary (2001) Curtis is happiest in a universe of sudden extroverts of men and women who blurt out how they really feel then freeze in mortification then stammer on cursing themselves when its over for being such asses. Then they go out and make still more embarrassing declarations--which is why we love them especially when its all in the name of love. Appropriately Love Actually is Curtis own embarrassing declaration of love. The title comes from the old Troggs song ""Love Is All Around"" the one that begins ""I feel it in my fingers I feel it in my toes."" The movies original title was Love Actually Is All Around and a prologue (read by Hugh Grant) avers that to understand this idea all you need to do is go to the arrivals terminal at Heathrow Airport and watch people hugging. By way of illustration the film begins and ends with airport hugging montages There are more hugs per square inch of celluloid than in all the Christmas movies in all the world. Advertisement Love Actually has too much of everything actually--stars cameos crises climaxes. Set in the weeks leading up to Christmas it boasts nine (count em) love stories with another couple of subplots branching off. The stories are interwoven but they dont seem meant to comment on or illuminate one another. Theyre just variations on a theme some wildly comic some melancholy some cartoonish some grimly realistic. The movie is a giant box of holiday chocolates a few of them bittersweet but most of them densely nougaty with love songs poured into the gaps like treacle. Its terrific fun for an hour but by the last of its 129 minutes you might find yourself going into insulin shock. Given its fulsomeness any summary of Love Actually is apt to degenerate into a list. At the top--hierarchically speaking--is Hugh Grant who does his adorably abashed act as the new bachelor British prime minister. The PM arrives at his residence and is promptly smitten by Martine McCutcheon as Natalie a radiant working-class aide unaccountably labeled too plump by everyone but him. In a likely dig at the countrys current PM Grants character stands up to the visiting American president--a creepily frozen-faced turn by Billy Bob Thornton playing a peculiar cross between George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. This political interlude is not really a change of subject The PMs courage to cross the president publicly is born of rage at the Yank putting the moves on Natalie. Emma Thompson is the PMs sister She and husband Alan Rickman have settled into a dull middle age; but hes agonizing over whether or not to have a fling with his hotcha secretary (Heike Makatsch) who makes cow eyes at him and opens her legs. Rickman is also the boss (and amorous adviser) of Laura Linney a love-smitten American whose sometimes violent schizophrenic brother--umbilically connected to her via her cell phone--makes other relationships dicey. Crime novelist Colin Firth comes home to find his brother sleeping with his girlfriend so he heads for a French villa and falls for his Portuguese cleaning lady (Lucia Moniz) Neither speaks a word of the others language but the subtitles tell us theyre reading each others minds. Liam Neeson plays a grieving widower whose Haley Joel Osment-like son (Thomas Sangster) has redirected his emotion onto a beautiful girl in his school His father advises him to become a drummer because they get women no matter what they look like. (Ringo Starr he points out married a Bond girl.) In other news Thomas Lincoln has a mysterious antipathy to his buddy Chiwetel Ejiofors new bride Keira Knightley while a couple of movie sex-scene stand-ins grope each other all day but are too shy to ask each other out and a geek dreams of going to America where the wenches allegedly throw themselves at Brits. As a writer Curtis is a wizard at keeping all these balls in the air; as a first-time director hes not nearly so nimble. Some of the serious threads--the schizophrenic brother the grieving husband a reference to 9/11--feel a little cheap in this bash-along context. And whenever Curtis puts on the brakes--in for example a scene between Linney and her brother in which he suddenly moves to strike her--the harsh reality feels exploitive. Its a good thing Curtis has a comic wild-card--a burned-out rocker called Billy Mack whose last-ditch attempt at a No. 1 record is a variation on ""Love Is All Around"" with ""love"" replaced by ""Christmas."" Billy is played by the Bill Nighy (pronounced ""Nigh"") a dry slightly mummified actor who was marvelous in a more modest English omnibus love movie called Lawless Heart released in the United States this year. (He was also well-cast as a lordly vampire in Underworld [2003] although he couldnt really cut loose.) Youll know why he owns Love Actually from his first scene in which he records the song while holding his nose. In his second scene in a Watford radio station he drives his loyal-dog manager Joe (Gregor Fisher) to near apoplexy with impromptu quips about the rottenness of his record. Nighys Billy Mack is refreshing in that hes beyond embarrassment--at least until the end when he makes his own unexpectedly heartfelt declaration of love. A couple of the other stories end grimly or unresolved but the prevailing tone is fairy tale with the characters sadness and isolation a prelude to some magical act of communion. Curtis other movies climax with something like the hitherto hesitant lover making a mad dash to the airport to stop the beloved from getting on a plane. In this one there are four or five mad dashes and a host of intercut public declarations--all with the most god-awful jacked-up music pouring from the screen. Its too florid too calculated too too. Heres my emotional declaration I love Richard Curtis work. But I cant help feeling that the Bard of Embarrassment could use a touch more shame.

"Love Actually Is a Many Many Many Splendored Thing washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Love Actually Is a Many Many Many Splendored Thing Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday November 7 2003 ""LOVE ACTUALLY"" is less in love with love -- although with nine separate subplots about heterosexual coupling it is certainly that -- than it is in love with itself and its own cleverness. Mind you theres lots to like if not love in this London-set star-studded comedy. Unfortunately theres a little bit to hate too. But first the good news. Written and directed by Richard Curtis (writer of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" ""Notting Hill"" and ""Bridget Joness Diary"") the script is a mostly witty audience-charming froth with a healthy if not always fully fleshed-out balance between the sweet and the bitter. I suppose its evidence of my slightly perverse taste (as well as Curtiss) but my favorite plot lines in what is essentially a comic romp about the ubiquity of love are those flavored not with the sap of happy-ever-afterdom such as the central upstairs/downstairs romance between the prime minister (Hugh Grant) and working-class staff member Natalie (Martine McCutcheon) but with the complex bouquet of thwarted intentions. One story involving the disintegration of trust between a woman (Emma Thompson) and her almost-philandering husband (Alan Rickman) and another involving a neurotic American (Laura Linney) whose infatuation with a gorgeous co-worker (Rodrigo Santoro) is paralyzed by a martyr complex focused on her mentally ill brother are among the most interesting and the most achingly real. What a shame then that theres not much room in this crowded film for these stories to be developed in much more than cursory fashion. Particularly not when valuable celluloid real estate is wasted on such story lines as the one about a boorish and horny Brit (Kris Marshall) who convinces himself that his English accent will act as a natural aphrodisiac on this side of the pond leading to an exercise in stateside bad taste straight out of MTV Productions. Curtis who reportedly has set aside enough unused ideas in the making of this film to make a second one should have considered letting this episode fall to the cutting room floor too. Its not a fatal miscalculation -- theres enough thats right about ""Love"" to compensate for whats wrong with it -- but such missteps detract from Curtiss otherwise admirable mastery of multiple interwoven narratives. Another quibble Although theres an initial hint that there may be a gay/straight/straight love triangle involving a new bride (Keira Knightley) her husband (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and her husbands best friend (Andrew Lincoln) -- something that there seems to be more than enough room for in a movie purporting to be about love in all its many splendors -- Curtis ultimately opts for the more conventional i.e. straight/straight/straight formulation. That along with the tittering were meant to do when a washed-up rock star (Bill Nighy in a scene-stealing performance) declares his love for his longtime long-suffering manager (Gregor Fisher) leaves a faintly homophobic aftertaste. But these and other flaws chafe only because so much of ""Love Actually"" actually works. In its blend of relationships sublime (as between the recently widowed Liam Neeson and his lovelorn young stepson played by Thomas Sangster) and ridiculous (as between two porn-movie stand-ins played to deadpan perfection by Joanna Page and Martin Freeman) it aims to put not just a smile on your face but perhaps a tear in your eye as well. Like love ""Love Actually"" is far from perfect. But its close enough to perfection to hurt every once in a while when it blows up in your face. LOVE ACTUALLY (R 135 minutes) -- Contains obscenity sexual humor and partial nudity. Area theaters.

"Love Actually Romance Submerged in Sugar washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Love Actually Romance Submerged in Sugar Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday November 7 2003 ""Love Actually"" could have been ordered straight off a takeout menu of British romantic comedies. Take something from Column A (""About a Boy"") take something from Column B (""Bridget Joness Diary"") and as for the rest forget the alphabet and take as much as you can from ""Four Weddings and a Funeral."" Slather with heaps of cloyingly sweet froth and serve. Thats what writer-director Richard Curtis has done in ""Love Actually"" a busy overstuffed and achingly saccharine ensemble vehicle that features as it happens one wedding and a funeral. At least Curtis is stealing from himself He wrote the screenplays for ""Bridget Joness Diary"" and ""Four Weddings"" as well as ""Notting Hill"" the Cinderfella romance starring Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts. The connective element in all of these of course is Grant whose stammering self-deprecating devastatingly handsome presence made all of them hits of varying degrees. Curtis making his directorial debut here doesnt lean on the association. He has cast Grant alongside a dozen other actors in just one of countless story lines that jumble together to form a nonsensical if warmhearted roundelay. So we have Grant playing a young single British prime minister who yearns for his sweet unassuming secretary (Martine McCutcheon); Emma Thompson playing the PMs sister who is married to a straying nonprofit manager (Alan Rickman); Liam Neeson playing a man who has just lost his wife and is trying to forge a relationship with his stepson and who has a relationship to Thompsons character that is never entirely clear; Laura Linney playing a character who works at the aforementioned nonprofit and who yearns for its sweet unassuming graphic designer; and Colin Firth playing a cuckolded novelist who decamps for the South of France and yearns for a Portuguese maid. And thats just for starters. Have we mentioned the new bride (Keira Knightley) and her husbands lovesick best man? Or the two stand-ins on the set of a pornographic movie? Or the unappealing cater-waiter who finds passion and romance in Milwaukee in the dead of winter? Or the aging rock star played by Bill Nighy? Or the clerk played by Rowan Atkinson? Would you believe Billy Bob Thornton as the president? Denise Richards for a cameo anyone? Claudia Schiffer to block? If listing the cast of ""Love Actually"" is exhausting its even more tiring to watch it chiefly because Curtis makes such long-winded and strenuous labor of making such simple unassailable points. (He may be the only director earnest or self-important enough to invoke Sept. 11 2001 in a romantic comedy.) His premise -- stated during an admittedly touching opening documentary sequence filmed at the arrivals gate at Heathrow Airport -- is that ""love actually is all around us."" True enough but Curtis cant leave well enough alone throwing plot line on top of character on top of cliche on top of manipulation to create a movie whose desperation to be liked can have only one effect to make it thoroughly unlikable. Although Curtis has rounded up a redoubtable cast he misuses them in a series of too-cute gags and set pieces. So we have Grant at 10 Downing St. doing the Tom Cruise dance bit from ""Risky Business""; a wedding where the choir not only sings ""All You Need Is Love"" but wherein an entire orchestra pops up out of the audience and the priest high-fives the best man; a school Christmas play featuring moppets in octopus and lobster costumes and a 10-year-olds sexy solo worthy of Britney Spears; a mad dash through an airport for a first kiss; and a mad dash through France for a marriage proposal. A few recognizably human feelings manage to peek through sentimentalism that seems to have been applied with a trowel Thompson plays the harried middle-aged wife with dignity and pathos and Rickman and Neeson wring as much self-respect as they can from roles that are far from fully realized. Linney too is far underserved by a script trying too hard to shoehorn in every ""aw shucks"" moment from the romantic comedy canon. By the time ""Love Actually"" winds up back at Heathrow and Curtis reprises his conceit of showing real-life footage of arrivals what started out as a genuinely emotional moment feels like one cherry too many on a sagging confection. Love Actually (135 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for sexuality nudity and language.

Youd have to be Ebenezer Scrooge not to walk out smiling. Hugh Grant plays a bachelor prime minister in Love Actually. By Peter Mountain Universal Studios Thats not to say Love Actually isnt flawed. Sometimes a joke is milked for all its worth -- and then some. And a few setups are sitcom-ish with all-too-predictable punch lines. But the combination of the clever script top-notch talent and engaging subject -- love in its many forms -- makes Love one of the more entertaining experiences a moviegoer is likely to have during the holiday season. Its hard to fail when you have the cream of the U.K. crop signed on. Emma Thompson Hugh Grant Alan Rickman Liam Neeson and Colin Firth are all in top form. Laura Linney the lone American major player in the film was a brilliant addition. (Billy Bob Thornton makes a cameo appearance as a Clintonian American president.) More about the movie Love Actually    stars (out of four) Stars Hugh Grant Emma Thompson Liam Neeson Colin Firth Keira Knightley Director Richard Curtis Distributor Universal Pictures Rating R for sexuality nudity and language Opens today in select cities As good as all of these actors are in their various roles the movie is nearly stolen from them by Bill Nighy. As an aging rock star he stages a comeback with an awful Yuletide rendition of the Troggs 60s song Love Is All Around. His elder stoner swagger is hilarious. Writer Richard Curtis (Four Weddings and a Funeral Notting Hill) makes his directorial debut wisely choosing an ensemble romantic comedy with several intertwined stories. Love Actually is a light and winsome version of a Robert Altman character study. And as is usually the case with these patchwork stories some of the pieces are more compelling and enjoyable than others. At its finest Love is reminiscent of the best moments of Four Weddings and a Funeral. When it veers into slightly corny turf it brings to mind the far-more-mediocre Notting Hill. Among the better scenarios are Grant as a bachelor prime minister who is too busy to look for a wife. He surprises himself (and everyone else) by being smitten with a down-to-earth staffer (Martine McCutcheon) a slightly more full-figured gal than average. Theres an unexpectedly bittersweet bond between the luminous Keira Knightley and her husbands reserved best friend (Andrew Lincoln). And for tearjerking moments no one can beat Thompsons performance as the stalwart wife of the straying Rickman. A Christmas Eve scene showcases her talent for comedy pathos and pluck all the while breaking our hearts. The sum of Love Actually is greater than its parts. The film is bookended by shots of ordinary people affectionately greeting and tearfully seeing each other off at an airport. The device is a bit forced but ultimately touching. The same could be said for the movie as a whole which winningly demonstrates that despite all odds love is indeed all around us.

And this dear readers is the problem at the heart of ""Love Actually"" a movie that holds out its arms and begs us to come running for a hug when a shy smile and a slightly naughty twinkle would be so much more effective. Not that anything about ""Love Actually"" is off-putting; its all perfectly charming. Hugh Grant for example is the prime minister of Great Britain (never mind that in the United States the hair alone would keep him out of public office). Hes in love in a bumbling pre-""Bridget-Jones"" sort of way with the winsome lass (Martine McCutcheon) who brings him his tea. This is however only one tiny subplot in a movie crammed to bursting with stories of plummy-voiced Brits coping with the vagaries of love. Richard Curtis screenwriter of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" ""Notting Hill"" and ""Bridget Jones Diary"" makes his directing debut with this holiday bonbon. Hes cranked his trademark charm up several notches resulting in a movie so extra-lovable that it features a massive choir singing ""All You Need Is Love"" Grant shaking his pinstriped booty to a Pointer Sisters tune and Colin Firth in a nubby turtleneck. (That last bit is I know enough to make all of you ""Pride and Prejudice"" fans stampede for the multiplexes. It is for the record the sweater equivalent of a heathery tweed jacket and he drinks lots of tea while wearing it. Have a nice time.) Movie review 1/2 ""Love Actually"" with Alan Rickman Bill Nighy Colin Firth Emma Thompson Hugh Grant Laura Linney Liam Neeson Martine McCutcheon. Written and directed by Richard Curtis. 128 minutes. Rated R for sexuality nudity and language. Several theaters. Fashion statements aside ""Love Actually"" suffers from an embarrassment of riches. The very well-connected Curtis has enlisted some of the biggest names in British cinema for this film which also includes Emma Thompson (who hasnt made a movie in years) Alan Rickman Irish actor Liam Neeson and current It Girl Keira Knightley (of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and ""Bend It Like Beckham""). Also on hand is Laura Linney trapped in a miserable subplot about a woman who cant make room for love because of family obligations. And Rowan Atkinson in a too-brief cameo as a fussy clerk. And ... well a person gets worn out just thinking about all the story lines here. If only somebody preferably Hugh Grant would bring me a cup of tea. Suffice to say that it all takes place around Christmastime and that the stories are wildly uneven; several could easily have been lopped off others cry out for more time. Curtis premise is charming -- an initial voice-over reminds us that ""love actually is all around"" with the sleighful of stories meant to illustrate love in all of its diversity. But ""Love Actually"" doesnt demonstrate much diversity (everyones heterosexual well-spoken and picturesque) and seems oddly focused on employer/underling relationships with handsome middle-aged men casting eyes on their pretty employees. Thompson and Rickman as a long-married couple facing a crisis (involving natch his secretary) have the most poignant story; not so much because of the way its written but because of the sincerity they bring to it. Rickman has a perfect dryness to his lines; hes perplexed by his assistants flirtatiousness; Thompson has a scene of quiet realization thats devastating. Other subplots are (mostly) lighter. Bill Nighy is marvelously funny as an aging rock musician whos shamelessly recorded a vile Christmas tune in order to rake in some money; hes a desiccated twitchy fellow with a cheerful awareness of his own awfulness. Its no hardship whatsoever to sit through ""Love Actually"" and some of its scenes are as good as anything on the romantic-comedy scene today. (Just try to resist the Grant plot which uses his clipped breezy charm to perfect effect.) But if Curtis could have sharpened his focus and trusted his actors a bit more (rather than constantly drowning them out with treacly pop music) ""Love Actually"" could have been splendid. Love it turns out isnt quite all you need.

Photo Credit Peter ... more Photo HO Not enough Hugh Grant too many sappy pop songs in Love Actually 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Love Actually Romantic comedy. Starring Hugh Grant Martine McCutcheon Liam Neeson Emma Thompson Laura Linney Alan Rickman Bill Nighy. Directed and written by Richard Curtis. (R. 128 minutes. At Bay Area theaters). Because he is British and because his movies feature posh accents and a twinkly well-scrubbed London Richard Curtis (""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" ""Notting Hill"" ""Bridget Joness Diary"") is viewed as a screenwriter of some substance. But ""Love Actually"" Curtis holiday-themed directing debut abandons any pretext of sophistication for gloppy sentimentality sugary pop songs and bawdy humor -- an approach that works about half the time. Curtis patented ace Hugh Grant elevates ""Love Actually"" every time hes onscreen which is not often enough in this overcrowded ensemble piece. As the bachelor prime minister Grant further hones his impeccable comic timing and outshines a star-laden cast that includes Emma Thompson Liam Neeson and Laura Linney. Much the way George Clooney has Grant has matured into a bona fide movie idol before our eyes. The fluttery fop of 1994s ""Four Weddings"" has become a commanding but still self-effacing presence able to draw laughs with the slightest double take. Or in this case shake of his tush. Having a character erupt into dance is a compulsion in feel-good romantic comedies these days but Grant lends originality even to this hackneyed setup. He moves awkwardly to the Pointer Sisters ""Jump (For My Love)"" as if he the actor were embarrassed but trying to be a good sport. Of the pictures many barely intersecting love stories the one with Grant has the most appeal. His newly minted PM falls for a vivacious assistant played by Martine McCutcheon (from the British soap ""EastEnders""). The actors bring great chemistry to the unlikely duo of upper-crust politician and saucy young woman a few steps down the class ladder. McCutcheon even overcomes a tired meet-cute scene that has the assistant inadvertently cursing in front of her new boss. When the movie begins its a few weeks before Christmas and ""Love Is All Around Us"" the overdone soundtrack tells us. The Brits love their pop music and Curtis seems to love it more than most. The ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" writer stages a wedding reception and funeral with the Bay City Rollers ""Bye Bye Baby"" playing at both. This groaner of a coincidence telegraphs the silliness to come. With so many romantic story lines the movie can go 30 minutes at a stretch before revisiting characters. A few of the pairings never catch fire like the nude body doubles shyly courting while fake-humping away on a movie set. A bit where a geek goes to America to ply his British accent on beautiful women has all the wit of a bad beer commercial. But most of the story lines maintain interest because of the fine cast and general goodwill of the picture. Neeson is touching as a recent widower with an 11-year-old stepson (Thomas Sangster) in the throes of his first crush. Sangster creates a darling brooding boy even if his character is a touch too articulate for his age. A scene of the boy in the presence of his sweetheart reveals the saucer-eyed Sangsters crack comic skills. Grants ""Bridget Jones"" nemesis Colin Firth unstiffens to play a cuckold who has repaired to his French hideaway and fallen for his Portuguese maid. This being Curtis land the pair find love even though they dont speak a word of each others language. Lucia Moniz brings intelligence and sly flirtation to her character. McCutcheon and Moniz fare better than the films more famous actresses. Thompson plays a homemaker convinced that her husband (Alan Rickman) is cheating with his slutty secretary. Thompson and Rickman have too much dignity for such a cliche and their story line suffers for it. The actors show such easy lived-in affection that we cant believe this guy would stray and the scene where the wife discovers her husbands likely infidelity offers Curtis most criminal overuse of music. Thompson breaks down to Joni Mitchells latter-day weary version of ""Both Sides Now."" The song is gorgeous and Thompsons ache heartfelt but the combination cancels both out. Linney playing a lonely woman with a yen for a handsome co-worker is saddled with a subplot (or sub-subplot in a movie with so much going on) about wrenching family ties. Curtis injected somber elements into ""Four Weddings"" and ""Notting Hill"" but his otherwise featherweight touch on ""Love Actually"" makes the seriousness of the Linney story line seem weird and jarring. Bill Nighy provides pure comic relief as an aging rock star -- sort of the equivalent of Rhys Ifans scuzzy roommate in ""Notting Hill."" Channeling the reptilian grace and reflexive truth telling of Keith Richards Nighy nearly steals the movie from Grant. His character has recorded a Christmas song he knows is crap but he still wants to win the top spot on the holiday charts from a boy band. An ""old ex-heroin addict looking for a comeback at any price"" deserves a shot the rocker reasons to a radio disc jockey. The race for No. 1 song consumes the British media in the picture (as it probably would in real life) fostering a sense of community found in England thats missing in the United States. That lovely sense of oneness comes with a steep price though having to endure a lot of bad music. Advisory Contains raw language sexual situations.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

Let it be said that I drew the line at Notting Hill a cloying piece of dreck in which that quintessential anonymous Everyman Hugh Grant got to shack up with Julia Roberts. Love Actually is rather lazily knocked off from Notting Hill though this time Grant plays the star a Blair-alike prime minister who falls for an ample foul-mouthed secretary (played with proletarian gumption by Martine McCutcheon) at Number 10. But it is far and away the more winning movie and it comes by its unrelenting schmaltz more or less honestly. If youre going to have your emotional responses shunted around like a gear stick it might as well be by someone who writes dialogue as funny as Curtis does and who in his first outing as a director brings Oxbridge panache and unquenchable sincerity to what is essentially a souped-up situation comedy. Slickly framed by the run-up to a London Christmas storyboarded within an inch of its life and snappily edited to rein in a plethora of subplots Love Actually reaches out to the hapless soul within all of us who cant connect or insists on loving the one we cant have or lusts after the hard-bodied secretary or lacks the courage to declare ourselves. Though the movie is billed as a vehicle for Grant in fact the actor only shows up every 20 minutes or so to do his usual embarrassed shuffle and stutter and run his fingers through his hair. (Why he keeps doing this tired shtick when given a bit of remorseless villainy to work with -- Restoration An Awfully Big Adventure -- the man can actually act is a mystery or would be if he didnt bring home the box-office bacon every time.) For the rest a vast ensemble of characters played by big-deal British stars sprinkled with talented character actors and a few Yanks for import-export purposes run around bumping into each other as they make the usual hashes of their love lives. The movie is littered with sensitive males among them Liam Neeson as an inconsolable widower trying to advise his lovelorn stepson; the infallible Alan Rickman as an excruciatingly ill-at-ease executive chafing under his comfortable marriage; and followers of Colin Firths torso will be ecstatic to hear that the dishy actor as a diffident mystery writer with a radar for the wrong woman once again dives shirtless into a pond. There are some ineffably funny moments most of them provided by Bill Nighy as a drug-addled aging rock star trying to make a comeback with the gooey 60s hit ""Love Is All Around"" and Curtis longtime collaborator Rowan Atkinson as a department-store salesman with an irregular attitude toward gift-wrap. Still for a romantic comedy Love Actually is a pretty good anatomy of loneliness and grief whether its that of Emma Thompson striving in vain for dowdiness as Rickmans stay-at-home wife whos trying to cope with the fact that her clueless husband has just bought his nubile secretary a pricey necklace or of Laura Linney as a tweedy office employee pining for a handsome colleague even as she fields impossible family commitments. True the director makes sure in almost every case that everything comes up roses. Movies like Love Actually are often made by jaded cynics preying on our shallowest feelings. One senses that Curtis is not a cynic but a congenital optimist who believes that notwithstanding the evening news love really is all around -- or at least lurking by the arrivals gate at Heathrow airport. Love Actually is often banal but it is not false and even its willfully sunny creator will allow that love doesnt conquer all. The truest most affecting scenes come late in the movie and they have nothing to do with resolution and everything to do with renunciation.

Sep. 13 600pm In Elf a tale of the triumph of insane goodness over negligible evil Will Ferrell plays an oversize elf looking for his long-lost papa in the fleshpots of Manhattan. So pure of heart is Buddy that there are moments when you want to kill him but on the whole hes an affable if strangely dressed fellow whose mission did he but know it is to restore the spirit of Christmas to the heedless hellhole that is New York City. This rather goes against the Zeitgeist which since September 11 has retooled Manhattan into a paragon of fortitude and fraternal solidarity. Still why quibble with the adjusted reality of Parental Guidance -- which requires a clear division between good and evil -- especially when it comes in a package as charmingly irreverent as Elf? Our story begins in a spiffed-up North Pole where an orphaned baby is being raised by a laconic Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) with occasional assistance from a gruff Santa (Ed Asner). When Buddy grows into a 6-foot-3-inch giant too clumsy for the toy-making detail Papa Elf must explain to the boy that he is in fact a human. Eager to find his place in the world the lad treks blithely across cartoon America on foot to seek out the deadbeat dad who abandoned his mother before he was born. In New York it seems that Buddy has exchanged one outsider status for another The Big Apple turns out to be full of worms not the least of which is Buddys father Walter (James Caan straight of face) a childrens-book publisher much given to cutting corners in the service of the bottom line. Once convinced that Buddy is not a singing telegram Walter still wont give him the time of day even though his wife (Mary Steenburgen the worlds most childlike actress over 50) embraces the erstwhile elf as part of the family. No prizes for guessing whos the real prodigal son in this family. At first blush Elf may seem a stretch for director Jon Favreau but in fact it is all of a piece with Made and Swingers both of which are about overgrown kids adrift in big cities. If anything the movie is a departure for distributor New Line whose 2003 releases boast the shock doc The Real Cancun and the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Elf is not just a kids story but a Disney-perfect one to boot in which truth and innocence bring balm to a dysfunctional family and a city full of raging capitalists. But the movie allows Favreau to gently tweak cutesy Mouse House production values without abandoning the concept and it proves a splendid sandbox for his talents as director actor and (who knew?) cartoonist. The most endearing and visually inventive set pieces in Elf play out in a toy store and in Walters mailroom where Buddy brings joy to the world by creating a winter wonderland wherever he goes. For his part Ferrell doesnt do much other than prance about being good-natured and though the actor is somewhat glassy-eyed as if longing to be off somewhere doing impressions in his statutory green-and-yellow costume topping enormous curly slippers he looks adorably like a giant zucchini with its roots still on. And though Elf deserves a good hiding for criminally underutilizing the divine comedy of Zooey Deschanel who plays Buddys love interest (and unexpectedly sings like a nightingale) I cannot find it in my heart to spank a movie that boasts Bob Newhart in chrome-yellow tights bifocals and the same empty stare that made him the worlds goofiest television therapist.

"Love Actually | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; love-actually ) Love Actually (United Kingdom 2003) A movie review by James Berardinelli Love Actually doesnt have a cynical frame in its celluloid. Its for all those romantics who think there arent enough happy endings. Richard Curtis movie dips so deep into the well of feel-good sentiment that it will threaten to send some audience members into sugar shock. There are times when all of this goodwill feels a tad forced and artificial (such as at the ending) but on balance Love Actually is appealing and genial with plenty of solid laughs and worthy of a recommendation for those who appreciate this kind of thing. Just dont expect material thats edgy dark or challenging. Consider Love Actually the antidote to Mystic River. Love Actually has about a half-dozen happy endings some of which are more deserved than others. One in particular featuring an airport chase is so over-the-top that it feels like an exercise in absurdist fantasy. Curtis is trying for that inner glow that accompanies a really magical motion picture. He wants people exiting the theater to be walking on air thinking of romance. I dont think he quite hits the mark but most people (including me) were at least smiling and thats something. And no one seemed to be muttering about wanting to kill the filmmakers. The film is about love in its many forms and guises love between siblings love between parents and children love between spouses puppy love platonic love unrequited love and (of course) sexual/romantic love. The last unsurprisingly gets the most screen time as Curtis delights in pairing off a number of his characters. The ""central romance"" if there can be considered to be one is between the British Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) and a shapely assistant Natalie (former U.K. soap star Martine McCutcheon). Other couplings involve writer Jamie (Colin Firth) and his Portuguese maid Aurelia (Lucina Moniz); widower Daniel (Liam Neeson) and the mother of his step-sons classmate; the PMs sister Karen (Emma Thomspon) and her husband Harry (Alan Rickman); and Harrys subordinate Susan (Laura Linney) and a younger co-worker Carl (Rodrigo Santoro). Meanwhile people like aging pop star Billy Mac (Bill Nighy) and a details-oriented department store clerk (Rowan Atkinson) are around to provide comic relief. The problem with Love Actually as is often the case with large ensembles is that we dont spend nearly enough time with the interesting characters. Half of the stories presented in the film are sufficiently engaging that they could warrant their own feature and it becomes a little frustrating to get only the Cliff Notes version. Character development is spotty which pretty much goes with the territory when you divide 129 minutes by about 18 significant parts. How much can a writer do when he has an average of about 7 minutes to work with for each individual? One often gets the sense that the state of love is more important to Curtis than the people he uses to examine it. (Rumor has it that more than 60 minutes of cuts were necessary to get the movie down to an ""acceptable"" release length and these may re-appear for the DVD version.) Solid acting covers up some of the writers limitations. The cast is a whos who of U.K. actors with notables such as Hugh Grant Colin Firth Emma Thompson Kiera Knightley Alan Rickman Billy Nighy Liam Neeson and Rowan Atkinson having significant roles. They are joined by Billy Bob Thornton as an American president whos half Bill Clinton and half George W. Bush and Laura Linney. (Linney has the interesting distinction of having appeared in one of 2003s heaviest films Mystic River and one of the years lightest Love Actually.) I suppose one could consider Love Actually as a holiday motion picture since theres a heavy does of Christmastime atmosphere. However the movie isnt so intimately wed to the time of year that it cant exist without it (and viewers who sit down to watch it in the middle of summer wont find themselves longing for December). This is one of those times when a films goodwill allows critics and viewers alike to overlook its most egregious flaws and enjoy it for what its trying to be. This is Curtis first outing behind a camera but many potential movie-goers will be familiar with his work as a screenwriter which includes Bridget Jones Diary Notting Hill Four Weddings and Funeral and The Tall Guy (as well as the ""Mr. Bean"" and ""Blackadder"" TV series). Love Actually fits very well into that group and anyone who has enjoyed Curtis past projects will probably like his latest one.

Cheeky wit impossibly attractive cast and sure-handed professionalism are beguiling qualities which along with its all-encompassing romanticism should make this a highly popular early holiday attraction for adults on both sides of the pond. A roundly entertaining romantic comedy ""Love Actually"" is still nearly as cloying as it is funny. Grandly conceived by contemporary British genre master Richard Curtis as a mosaic of love stories that collectively stress the primacy of amour even in difficult times this doggedly cheery confection persists in going overboard with smiles hugs kisses and musical reassurances that all you need is love. But its cheeky wit impossibly attractive cast and sure-handed professionalism are beguiling all the same qualities which along with its all-encompassing romanticism should make this a highly popular early holiday attraction for adults on both sides of the pond. After stellar TV work on the likes of ""Not the Nine OClock News"" ""Blackadder"" and ""Mr. Bean"" the New Zealand-born Curtis emerged as Blightys most eminent commercial screenwriter with ""The Tall Guy"" ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" ""Notting Hill"" and ""Bridget Joness Diary."" He now moves confidently into the directors chair. For what its worth he gets both the wedding and the funeral out of the way early on in ""Love Actually."" Set in a spectacularly decorous London in the five weeks running up to Christmas pic makes a very big point of always looking on the bright side with the opening narration positioning even 9/11 as an event that occasioned an outpouring of love however distressed. To be sure any number of the characters here have to deal with frustration disappointment loss and pain but in almost every case these feelings are transitory and non-depressing. The characters scoot from misery or emotional paralysis to bliss in the time it takes to change clothes or whenever they discover that someone is interested in them. And in a move designed to give men some special satisfaction at a film many will be dragged to by women rarely have so many extraordinarily attractive women come on so eagerly to so many guys in a movie not about athletes or rock stars. Showing no strain putting as many balls as he wishes in the air and keeping them aloft Curtis deftly introduces his ensemble Drug-ravaged old wild man pop star Billy Mack (Bill Nighy) ""looking for a comeback at any price"" by cutting a sappy lyrics-altered Christmas version of ""Love Is All Around;"" newlyweds Juliet (Keira Knightley) and Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor) with the latters best friend Mark (Andrew Lincoln) secretly in love with the bride; a bachelor Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) taking up residence at 10 Downing St. and becoming instantly smitten by young tea girl Natalie (Martine McCutcheon) and the PMs sister efficient housewife and mother Karen (Emma Thompson) whose husband Harry (Alan Rickman) may be induced to stray by the provocations of his foxy secretary Mia (Heike Makatsch). Harry has an employee Sarah (Laura Linney) whos harbored a helpless crush on shy dreamboat Karl (Rodrigo Santoro) for nearly three years; also feeling the pangs of unrequited love is 10-year-old Sam (Thomas Sangster) whose mother has just died and who confesses to step-dad Daniel (Liam Neeson) his anguish over a girl in school; jilted writer Jamie (Colin Firth) retreats to the south of France where he begins a linguistically-challenged romance with Portuguese housekeeper Aurelia (singer Lucia Moniz); movie stand-ins John (Martin Freeman) and Judy (Joanna Page) are painfully reticent with one another even though they spend their days together simulating sex in the nude and then theres Colin (Kris Marshall) a gawky enthusiastic lad who is convinced that the answer to his dating woes lies in America. Woven together and occasionally intersecting so effectively that only one of the strands wears out its welcome -- the John and Judy interlude is archly drawn and doesnt go anywhere -- the vignettes are composed mostly of comic and emotional highlights with no down time. Due to the inspired concept and casting the wonderful passages featuring Grant as the debonairly rumpled new head of state are bound to be the most remarked upon especially in Britain. Specifically positioned as the next leader after Tony Blair Grants PM gets off some sharp zingers at his predecessor and in a scene designed specifically to appeal to the home market boldly stands up to the arrogant U.S. President (Billy Bob Thornton) a cowboy with an interest in young ladies to rival that of Bill Clinton. However the Prime Minister reveals a Clintonesque side as well in his obsession with Natalie. As neatly played by former pop tart and ""My Fair Lady"" McCutcheon the self-professedly overweight character bears a resemblance to Monica Lewinsky that cannot have been unintentional. Dismayed by the distraction Natalie presents Grants PM brings down the house when he peers up at an office portrait of Margaret Thatcher and asks ""Did you have this kind of problem? Oh of course you did you saucy minx."" Another highlight is Nighys sly portrait of the seen-and-done-it-all rocker so self-amused and unconcerned with what anyone thinks that he cant help but tell the rude truth at all times. At once leathery and pickled theater and TV vet Nighy has all the moves down as a sort of tidier Keith Richards for whom reclaimed success is just one giant and unexpected lark. In their own ways other storylines become engaging as well. Although Neesons Daniel seems overly anxious to move on from his wifes death and he much too readily uses sexual profanity with his little stepson (a trait off-puttingly shared here by other adults around pre-pubescent kids) Sangster is so winning as the lovelorn but resourceful Sam that spending time with the two of them is more than pleasant. Marshall is a joy as the enthusiastic bloke who hits the babe jackpot the moment he arrives in the U.S. The nervous attraction between Jamie and Aurelia who dont comprehend a word theyre exchanging but understand one another perfectly all the same is expertly played for laughs as well as heart tugs and die-hard romantics will fall hook line and sinker for the very public climax to their courtship. Portraying more melancholy emotions are Thompsons Karen who succinctly captures the controlled anxiety of a woman who senses her marriage might be fracturing before her eyes and Linneys Sarah whos selflessly boxed herself into a place where romance is truly impossible. Overall the cast is outrageously attractive playing characters almost uniformly hot to trot at a moments notice. Still as the episodes are stacked into a mile-high love sandwich the film comes to seem too insistent too calculated too much the cheerleader for a cause that doesnt need such relentless persuasion. The grand finale which brings most of the characters -- and hundreds of others -together in a Heathrow arrivals hall socks over the pictures overriding theme in a way that will send mainstream auds out in a happy mood. Curtis has presided over the creation of a package that feels as luxuriously appointed and expertly tooled as a Rolls-Royce. Michael Coulters resplendent lensing makes the beautiful people and terrific locations look even more fabulous than they do already a cause aided by Jim Clays production design and Joanna Johnstons costumes. Editor Nick Moore helps balance the storylines with keen senses of rhythm and proportion. Composer Craig Armstrong and music supervisor Nick Angel make catchy contributions that occasionally become overbearing. Pic has an invigorating and teasing sense of Anglo-American interplay that ranges from the political to the sexual.

On Nov. 7 2003 an R-rated ensemble romantic comedy hit theaters across America. The film Love Actually would later become a (much-debated) holiday staple on television screens. The Hollywood Reporters original review is below Love Actually reminds you of an elaborate Christmas card that tumbles apart with pop-up figures silly/charming greetings and perhaps even a jingle. It probably cost more than the gift it heralds and you cant help but laugh at the audacity of such an aggressively cheerful card. Clearly the gift giver wants to love and be loved and only a Scrooge would deny him his reward. But you also wish hed heard the phrase ""less is more."" The gift giver is Richard Curtis a writer (Four Weddings and a Funeral Notting Hill) and for the first time here director of comedies that focus on the pursuit of love. Curtis real gift is that of sharp rapid-fire dialogue easily recognizable characters a benign view of humanity and a knack for making sentimentality feel righteous. This movie for all its calculation and manipulation comes from a true believer. He really does believe -- as Oscar Hammerstein II once insisted a composer such as himself must -- in ""raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens."" Audiences should respond to the determinedly feel-good nature of Love Actually as a top-flight cast of (mostly) British actors sells its love message very well. The movie is less a traditional story than an elaboration of a theme. This gets pronounced by a narrator at the opening as you watch friends and family tearfully greet at Londons Heathrow Airport ""General opinions starting to make out that we live in a world of hatred and greed but I dont see that. Seems to me that love is everywhere."" The movie flips among myriad stories in the weeks before Christmas none terribly original or compelling in itself but in the aggregate they illustrate Curtis theme. A new bachelor prime minister (Hugh Grant) walks into 10 Downing Street and is immediately smitten with a staff member (Martine McCutcheon). A recently widowed stepfather (Liam Neeson) struggles to forge a deeper relationship with his late wifes son (Thomas Sangster). An executive (Alan Rickman) encourages a female employee (Laura Linney) to act on her longtime crush on a fellow worker (Rodrigo Santoro) even as he debates the wisdom of falling into an affair with a most willing colleague (Heike Makatsch) thus betraying his wife of many years (Emma Thompson). A bride (Keira Knightley) comes to realize that her husbands best mate (Andrew Lincoln) is madly in love with her. A cuckolded novelist (Colin Firth) flees to the south of France only to become infatuated with the Portuguese maid (Lucia Moniz) despite their inability to speak each others language. An aging rock star (a hilarious Bill Nighy) launches a comeback with a Christmas song he knows is crap and freely says so on a truth-telling tour. Squeezed between these subplots are eminently disposable ones such as two movie stand-ins who shyly fall in love while entirely naked or a food vendor who believes a trip to any bar in America will yield a bevy of beauties to fall for his English accent. These plot threads (and they really are threads) contain little substance. Each is intriguing but with the exception of the widower and stepson none achieves any resonance. All are too fragmentary though containing enough clever dialogue and sexy moments to distract from the sheer flimsiness. The production is a winning one with London turned into a winter wonderland with a side excursion to a rather summery-looking France. As always with a Curtis comedy the stories pivot around major set pieces -- a wedding funeral a school Christmas pageant and an implausible news conference in which the British PM dresses down an arrogant American president (Billy Bob Thornton). Curtis imbues his tales of broken hearts and ecstatic adoration with a festive passion and a cheerful optimism that sweeps the viewer up. Its only afterward that you wonder when the writer fell in love with the maid or why a prime minister would have no social life or how the wife forgave her wandering husband.
