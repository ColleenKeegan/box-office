These Gen-Y demigods are no different. In the 90s Zeus (Sean Bean) decreed that Olympian parents could have no contact with their half-breed offspring thus creating a whole generation of kids with daddy issues. Among them is Percy (Logan Lerman) a teen whos just learned that hes the son of Poseidon of the sea (Kevin McKidd) and Sally of Manhattan (Catherine Keener). And Uncle Zeus has just accused him of stealing his lightning bolt triggering a war of the gods set to detonate on the summer solstice. The unwieldy title tips the studios hand that theyd like to make a franchise out of Rick Riordans popular novels--theyve even hired director Chris Columbus for some of Harry Potters luck--but this first installment isnt a knockout. Lerman is a handsome kid and a fine dramatic actor but his Percy is so slim on brains and wonder that were just passively along for the ride. As Grover Percys satyr bodyguard Brandon T. Jackson (Alpa Chino in Tropic Thunder) has that missing spark even if we groan at watching a goat-legged hipster get busy on the dance floor. And if youre willing to forgive a flick that gives Athena a daughter (Google it) Alexandra Daddario has a lovely Grecian sternness to her face and she slings a sword like she means it. After the trio meets up at a camp for demigods (which is crowded to the brim--looks like abstinence-only education doesnt work on Olympus either) they set off to convince Zeus and Hades (Steve Coogan) of Percys innocence an odyssey that sees them confronting Medusa (Uma Thurman) in a twee statuary shoppe and getting sidelined by the pleasures of the Lotus Casino in Vegas (my favorite nudge to the ribs). Oddly the CGI wizardry on display is bottom of the barrel--if youre going to half-ass making a hydra youd be better off with Ray Harryhausens claymation.

When his mother is kidnapped by Hades (Steve Coogan in full Saxondale mode) as a bargaining chip for Zeuss lost lightning bolt Percy is charged with finding a number of trinkets dotted across North America in order to avert a crisis on Mount Olympus (located just above the New York cloud cover who knew?) and save mom from eternal damnation. That Percy risks life and limb to preserve the family unit is typical Columbus and the film works best when playing on the idea that no amount of bravado is enough to mask our desire for parental love. Yet its not enough to compensate for the computer-game-style plotting which is largely based on us picking up narrative nuggets that mechanically slot into place later on. Problematic too is the product placement witness the scene in which Percy battles Medusa (Uma Thurman) and avoids her deathly gaze by craftily using the shiny back of his iPod as a mirror.

The camp was much more dark and did not have the organized camp feeling and for the record Annabeth Chase had blond hair. Along with that a few scenes where missing I thought they where pretty important and a few other less important things that was it.

The main difference is summer camp where kids are forced to play capture-the-flag in leather breastplates and unflattering crested helmets. (Havent they heard of helmet hair?) Otherwise the heroic half-breeds in Percy Jackson amp; the Olympians The Lightning Thief look and act just like average American teenagers which is both the source of its goofiness -- no point denying it -- and much of its considerable charm. Im here to reassure all parents who expect to get dragged into theaters this weekend by fans of the Rick Riordan fantasy books which follow the exploits of its title young demigod and his posse. Grown-ups You wont be bored. And kids Dont try this at home. Sneaking into the underworld will only get you arrested. Even a quick glance at the premise suggests a sizable debt to Harry Potter whose powerful magical otherness was hidden from him through much of a dismal childhood. So it is with the bright but frustrated Percy Jackson (Logan Lerman the crescent-browed boy from My One and Only) who doesnt realize that his dyslexia and ADHD are just symptoms of some fancy DNA. Mom (Catherine Keener) never told him hes the son of Poseidon (Kevin McKidd) or that his brain is hard-wired to read ancient Greek or that hes been stashed away for his own safety with a stinky abusive stepfather (Joe Pantoliano). Turns out the god Zeus (Sean Bean) suspects Percy of stealing his lightning bolt. Dammit he wants it back. If Percy doesnt fork over the bolt by the summer solstice Zeus will wage war against his brothers Poseidon and Hades in an all-out Olympian-style Armageddon. (""War is not the answer"" objects Athena.) A whole lot of plot ensues -- an entertaining mix of buddy movie road trip Clash of the Titans archetypal quest and a coming-of-age tale about misfits making their way despite or because of absent parents. Percy and his buds (Alexandra Daddario and Brandon T. Jackson as a wise-cracking satyr) discover pockets of Greek mythology all over the country each one tricked out with clever effects and quips of mortal humor. Look for Uma Thurman in a turban lotus-eaters in a trance and a climactic battle in winged Converse high-tops. For purposes of casting or market demographics Percy is now on the far side of puberty; in the first book hes only 12. But director Chris Columbus has brought together the modern and mythical spheres with sharp pacing and a nifty sense of fun that atone for the films dippier moments. Its his most enjoyable effort since Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets . amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals The Mel Brooks Collection on Blu-ray for 25 + pickup at Best Buy GNC Mega Men Sport 90-Count Multivitamins for 9 + free shipping SanDisk 128GB Cruzer Glide USB Flash Drive for 20 + pickup at...

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Feb. 12 2010 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Feb. 12 2010 952AM EST Comments AA Country USA Language English Percy Jackson amp; The Olympians The Lightning Thief Directed by Chris Columbus Written by Craig Titley Starring Logan Lerman Alexandra Daddario Catherine Keener Classification PG A word of caution to anyone tempted to procreate with a Greek deity Turns out the greater the god the poorer the parent. Consider the particular case of young master Percy Jackson the offspring of Poseidon and Catherine Keener. Poor Percy has never laid eyes on his neglectful sea-ruling daddy and lives with his abandoned mom in a cramped New York walkup where hes plodding through high school just like any other bored teen. What a waste of his demigod talents - the kids not even on the swim team. Happily Percy Jackson amp; The Olympians The Lightning Thief - based on the Rick Riordan novel but really a Harry Potter knock-off right down to that mouthful of a title - is about to change all that. Quickly his buddy the satyr and his mentor the centaur rescue Percy (Logan Lerman) from the Muggles er mortals in Manhattan and pack him off to Hogwarts sorry Camp Half Blood to hone his godly skills. There in the company of other castoffs from similarly transcendent couplings he learns the value of vigorous exercise and (critically given his watery heritage) the importance of frequent hydration. Pretty soon hes kicking minotaur butt. Anyway for reasons that elude me cranky old Zeus has wrongfully accused the lad of stealing his lightning bolt thereby severely hampering the Great Ones audio-visual mastery of the skies. Since the movie that follows is all dull thunder without a spark of illumination its apparent that director Chris Columbus (another Potter alumnus) has taken Zeuss dilemma too much to heart. Of course Chris still has his CGI toolbox to play with and say this for the fellow From that centaur on down his special effects are a real horses ass. But back to our alleged lightning thief who along with that horny satyr and Athenas love-child Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario) embarks on a cross-country quest intent on reaching Hades and rescuing someone-or-other from its fiery pits. Well as ever the highway to hell is paved with good cinematic intentions The group battle Medusa and her snaky coils in New England; then take on Hydra and his many heads in Nashville; and later consort with the lotus-eaters in (where else?) Las Vegas. So its a road flick here but theres precious little motion in the picture - Columbus keeps slipping the clutch on the action scenes and stalling the movie. Far more impressive is the product placement Detroit will be delighted to know that a demigods ride of choice is a Ford pickup. Continuing westward ho the trio reach the coast and after some digging seem surprised to learn that Hades is located in the nether regions of Hollywood. Hell any working critic could have told them that. Less predictable is our discovery that the lord of the underworld is none other than Steve Coogan decked out for the occasion in a rockers leather pants and dishevelled do. Here Id like to be able to issue a High Camp alert to reassure you that Coogan amp; company are treating this material with an entertaining measure of ironic disrespect. Alas not really - dutifully Potteresque it begins and dutifully Potteresque it ends. Perhaps such reverence will sit well with Riordans callow readers. The rest of us are left to ponder the coincidence that Percy Jackson amp; The Olympians was shot in Vancouver where those other Olympians demigods for a televised fortnight are now poised to begin their own quest. There on the tops of mountains heaven is owning the podium. Here in the limbo of Hollywood the wise will merely rent - on some distant rainy Saturday when the kids are restless.

C+ Percy Jackson and the Olympians The Lightning Thief Genre Sci-fi and Fantasy; Starring Brandon T. Jackson Pierce Brosnan Logan Lerman Sean Bean Uma Thurman; Director Chris Columbus; Release Date Wide 02/12/2010; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor 20th Century Fox Film Corporation Posted February 12 2010 -- 1200 AM EST For those who havent read the hit Percy Jackson books heres a crib sheet for that humdinger of a title Teenage Percy (Lerman) discovers hes actually a powerful demigod; the Olympians are the feisty deities of Greek mythology (including Percys absentee dad Poseidon); and the lightning thief is the unknown bandit who has stolen Zeus thunderbolt dooming the entire world -- unless young Percy can find it. Punctuated by painful dialogue and high-camp celeb cameos (notably Uma Thurman as a vampy Medusa) the ensuing quest has all the CGI sorcery of a Harry Potter pic but none of the magic.

"Movie review Percy Jackson amp; the Olympians The Lightning Thief isnt magical washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On >> This StoryRead +| Comments Percy Jackson amp; the Olympians The Lightning Thief Movie review Percy Jackson amp; the Olympians The Lightning Thief isnt magical Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday February 12 2010 Harry Ron and Hermione Relax. You could whip Percy Jackson and his pals with your wand hands tied behind your backs. As magical teenage movie heroes go the adolescent trio at the center of ""Percy Jackson amp; the Olympians The Lightning Thief"" is no match for the gang from Gryffindor. This StoryPercy Jackson amp; the Olympians The Lightning Thief This is no epic adventureWatch the Lightning Thief trailerFind showtimes Mostly its a matter of casting. Fans of Rick Riordans books -- a five-volume series about a boy who discovers hes the half-human half-divine son of the Greek god Poseidon -- will be disappointed to learn that in the translation of this first book from page to screen the title character has gone from a wisecracking misfit who wakes up with superpowers to well a washout. In the book hes like Holden Caulfield with a sword. And ""phonies"" are people who transform into Furies and hydras. As played by Logan Lerman Percy is a pretty boy with good hair but no discernable interior life. The special effects have more going on behind their eyes. In the smart-girl role of the goddess Athenas daughter Annabeth Alexandra Daddario doesnt fare much better. Together she and her co-star make Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens look like Tracy and Hepburn. Only Brandon T. Jackson manages to make much of an impression as Grover the goofy jive-talking satyr who is Percys best friend. Then theres the story. Most of it survives the adaptation by director Chris Columbus and screenwriter Craig Titley. When Percy is accused of stealing a lightning bolt belonging to Zeus (Sean Bean) the boy and his friends must put things right. Which means not only finding out who the real thief is but also rescuing Percys mortal mother (Catherine Keener) who has been abducted by Hades (Steve Coogan in a bit of brilliant if eccentric casting). Never mind that entire characters have been eliminated in the process of turning Riordans book into a movie. The god Ares is missing for instance along with his half-blood daughter Clarisse. And never mind that whole scenes had to be rewritten to become more you know cinematic. Theres lots more flying around now in a climactic scene that looks suspiciously like a rip-off of Quidditch. Hey thats showbiz folks. And the book had waaay too much going on in it anyway. Fortunately two great set pieces remain largely intact a sequence where the kids run into Medusa (Uma Thurman wearing a coif of wriggling computer-generated snakes) and one where Percy Annabeth and Grover get waylaid in a Vegas casino with a bunch of drugged-out lotus eaters. What hurts more than little tweaks -- a character here a scene there -- is the almost wholesale loss of the books voice. Percys sense of humor as realized by Riordan was a sardonic delight. And Percys literary adventures while they could at times be violent were always tempered with narrative wit. Dont get me wrong. A couple of characters get off some real zingers here. Grover actually suggests at one point that President Obama might be a demigod. But the movie suffers by taking itself a little too seriously. Its not just that its a lot less funny than the book. Its also a lot less fun.  PG. At area theaters. Contains action violence monsters suggestive material and a bit of crude language. 119 minutes. >> This StoryRead +| Comments (c) 2010 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  This is no epic adventure Watch the Lightning Thief trailer Find showtimes",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/11/AR2010021101456.html,200,percyjackson&theolympiansthelightningthief6,percyjackson&theolympiansthelightningthief,washingtonpost

Beware would-be fantasy fran chises bearing Greek gods es pecially if they have tongue-twisting titles like ""Percy Jackson amp; the Olympians The Lightning Thief."" That goes double if youre not prepared to go with the idea of Pierce Brosnan as an apparently gelded minotaur (""Yes I have a real horses ass"") running an institution called Camp Half Blood. Adapted by Craig Titley from his tweener best seller with a similar name this is the latest in Hollywoods long series of attempts to create another Harry Potter. Its even directed by Chris Columbus who initially helmed that cash machine. Columbus struggle to find a consistent tone as he did in the first two ""Potter"" films (before he was replaced by better directors) is even more evident here The film toggles between high camp and deadly earnestness all the while threatening to drown in an ocean of not-so-special effects. Played by Logan Lerman -- the Zac Efron look-alike who was young George Hamilton in ""My One and Only"" -- Percy is a Manhattan high-schooler who learns he is a demigod. Hes the offspring of Poseidon (Kevin McKidd) and a mortal (Cathleen Keener) who subsequently married a local lout (Joe Pantoliano) in order to as she explains ""mask the smell of your blood."" This revelation comes out after Zeus (Sean Bean) wrongly blames Percy for stealing his lightning bolt and threatens a war with Poseidon that will finish humanity. For reasons I couldnt quite comprehend Percys mother is kidnapped by their brother Hades (Steve Coogan) even though he is supposedly exiled to the underworld. Joined by a tiresomely motormouthed satyr (Brandon T. Jackson) and the butt-kicking demigod daughter of Athena (Alexandra Daddario) Percy sets off on an odyssey to save mom. The first stop is New Jersey (and the first of several nods to ""The Wizard of Oz"") where they face down Medusa (an over-the-top Uma Thurman) with the help of a Hummer and an iPhone. Then its off for lotus-eating in Las Vegas where the PG rating really pushes the envelope for suggestiveness. Titleys most inspired idea is to locate the entrance to hell -- where Rosario Dawson camps it up with Coogan -- just under the Hollywood sign. Having Mount Olympus accessed via a phony-looking mockup of the Empire State Buildings observation deck seems a trifle obvious though. ""Youve been unconscious for three days"" someone tells our hero at one point and after two hours of ""Percy Jackson"" I was starting to feel the same way. Did that satyr really hint that President Obama is a demigod or did I just dream that?

BOTTOM LINE Shamelessly rides Harry Potters cape-tails but still passably entertaining. CAST Logan Lerman Alexandra Daddario Pierce Brosnan LENGTH 159 Not every script in existence deserves to be compared to the ""Harry Potter"" movies but attention must be paid - especially when it comes to any new fantasy film aimed at young adults. ""Percy Jackson amp; the Olympians The Lightning Thief"" is based on a series of books by Rick Riordan the first of which appeared in 2005. The movie makes a Herculean effort to seem original; the results are more Sisyphean. A normal American high schooler Percy (Logan Lerman) discovers he is a demigod born of Poseidon and enrolls in a school for others like him. Its name might exasperate Potter fans Camp Half Blood. There he trains under the centaur Chiron played by a convincingly equine Pierce Brosnan. Percy also excels at a sport (capture-the-flag disappointingly) and befriends demibabe Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario). Brandon T. Jackson as Percys satyr sidekick provides the usual hip-hop sass. advertisement | advertise on newsday Falsely accused of stealing Zeus lightning bolt Percy embarks on a quest which gives director Chris Columbus (who also directed the first two ""Harry Potter"" movies) his chance to mix pop culture with Greek mythology. Percy scours U.S. kitsch capitals from Nashville to Las Vegas searching for authentic treasures among the faux monuments. Uma Thurman shows up as a fashionista Medusa; Steve Coogan plays Hades in rock-and-roll drag. Some of this is amusing but none of it can substitute for the genuine magic of the ""Harry Potter"" films. Likable as Percy may be its not lightning hes stolen.

Movie Information Percy Jackson amp; the Olympians The Lightning ThiefRatingShowtimes | Official site | TrailerDirector Chris ColumbusActors Logan Lerman Brandon T. Jackson Alexandra Daddario Catherine Keener Pierce Brosnan and Rosario DawsonRun time 119 minutesMPAA rating PG (mild violence intense action)Synopsis Greek god Poseidons half-human son Percy and his friends are caught between Mount Olympus warring factions in this film based on the popular young-adult novels.More movies from GuideLive.comThus we are introduced to the world of Percy Jackson amp; the Olympians The Lightning Thief. As its ungainly title indicates viewers have some heavy disbelief-suspension work to do and the movie rewards that effort in some ways and not so much in others. The film is directed by Chris Columbus who oversaw the first two Harry Potter movies and comparisons between the two projects are unavoidable.Like Harry Percy discovers that his whole life has been a lie told to him for his own protection. Percy (Logan Lerman who showed his acting chops as the eldest son in 310 to Yuma) discovers hes the son of Poseidon (Kevin McKidd). He discovers this by finding out that Poseidons brother Zeus (Sean Bean) is convinced that Percy stole his lightning bolt and will start a war of the gods if its not returned. And so begins Percys fantastical adventure full of Furies and satyrs and centaurs - oh my. Also like Harry Percy is based on a series of books (by Rick Riordan) and Fox Studio is plainly hoping to mine its own vein of franchise gold. Based on this opening chapter that seems unlikely. The film is for a time energetic fun and there are several sequences full of cutting-edge eye candy. Also to its credit the film doesnt clutter up its story with adult-friendly jokes and references. This is a kids movie Parents can either get into the silly-suspenseful spirit of it or play Rummikub on their iPhones.You can see the franchise ambitions of Percy in the surprising number of brand-name actors in the cast. But for every payoff - Uma Thurman is great fun as the slithery-seductive Medusa - there are a couple of penalties. Pierce Brosnan is flat-out ridiculous as Chiron the centaur who presides over the training camp for demigods. And Catherine Keener is shamefully wasted as Percys mortal mother who does little more than fret and fuss over her superpowered son.Apparently Columbus didnt learn from his Harry Potter experience as Percy suffers from the same problem of feeling less like a single story and more like a hodge-podge of scenes and set pieces. Percy is joined by Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) his satyr buddy-protector and Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario) warrior princess and daughter of Athena for a cross-country scavenger hunt that lands them - where else? - in Las Vegas. And from there its off to Hollywood which is - hee-hee - the portal to Hades.The filmmakers try to ground all this fantasy fluff in the real-world emotions of kids growing up in single-parent homes. As one of the demigod kids quips ""Guess we all got daddy issues."" It turns out Poseidon is the ultimate absentee father. But the climactic meeting between father and son rings not just hollow but ludicrous ""Just because you didnt see me didnt mean I wasnt there. I was in your thoughts and dreams.""This is presented as some sort of beautiful healing truth but as anyone living in the real world knows thats just fantasy. \ editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

Luke Skywalker? Harry Potter? Guess again Percy Jackson archetypal hero for the modern emo middle schooler.Percy Jackson (Logan Lerman) is a loser. Because he has dyslexia the question on the blackboard is too hard to decipher. Because he has ADHD he cant focus. And because he has an abusive stepfather Percy cant bear to be at home.What Percy does not yet know is that hes also a demigod spawn of Poseidon (Kevin McKidd) and a mortal (Catherine Keener). And that his best bud Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) is really his protector. And that his real name is Perseus after the rare classical hero whose saga does not end tragically.As Percy has always felt best when swimming it follows that Dad is the god of the sea. But no sooner does Percy learn his paternity than he finds himself accused of stealing Zeus lightning bolt and sees his mother abducted and possibly vaporized by Hades god of the Underworld.Based on the young-adult series by Rick Riordan Percy Jackson amp; the Olympians The Lightning Thief is a diverting action fantasy that modernizes the stories of demigods and monsters. (Riordan imagines the Greek gods as sparring siblings who sic their fanged pets on one another.) Like the mythical Perseus Percy neutralizes Medusa that babe with the nest-of-vipers coif and flies around with the help of winged footwear - except here they are not sandals but Converse high-tops.Yet as brought to the screen by Chris Columbus maker of the Home Alone movies and the first two Harry Potters The Lightning Thief feels more like an audition to fill the franchise vacuum that will be left by the imminent end of the Potter series. The trio of lead actors particularly Lerman as Percy are agreeable. But the film is heavy with special-effects action and light on the playful humor that makes Riordans books such a fun read. (Like hot peppers special effects should be used sparingly lest they dull the senses and overwhelm the dish. Percy Jackson suffers from effects overload.)Lerman Jackson (as Grover a teen satyr desperate for his horns) and Alexandra Daddario (as Annabeth Athenas butt-kicking illegitimate daughter) set out to clear Percys name and reclaim his mom with tools apparently lifted from the Harry Potter prop master. Percy has a diagram very much like Harrys Marauders Map that guides the trio across country to pearls that will be their get-out-of-Hades-free passes. (Although rated PG the action violence and scary monsters might freak out those under 8.)Like its stars the film is genial good company. While it wont kill any brain cells it is unlikely to enter the pantheon of epic screen adventures.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Directed by Chris Columbus. 119 minutes. At major theatres. PG Theres more than lightning getting pinched in the ponderously titled Percy Jackson amp; The Olympians The Lightning Thief. Fantasy fans will note the similarities between Percys tale and the stories of a young wizard in training - right down to magic flying devices.But while teenager Percy (310 to Yumas Logan Lerman showing promise) approaches his destiny as the demigod offspring of Poseidon and a mortal mom (Catherine Keener) with the same trepidation as Harry Potter he does so with a far hipper and more humorous sensibility.Article Continued BelowUnfortunately the movie lacks that good old Potter charm trading Harrys dark whimsy for a handful of CGI magic beans.With the Potter empire winding down as the two-parter of Deathly Hallows enters theatres this year and next you cant blame Hollywood for searching out a new magical franchise to fuel young imaginations. Rick Riordans line of Percy bestsellers must seem a likely place to source an heir. And with Clash of the Titans opening in March with Sam Worthington as Zeuss kid Perseus (and Liam Neeson as his dad) it would seem Greek mythology is hot for 2010 so why not join the party early?Once hes made aware of his heritage Percy is shipped off to Camp Half-Blood (shot in gorgeous Mission B.C.) under the protection of best pal Grover (Brandon T. Jackson). He meets up with the goddess Athenas offspring battling babe Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario) who puts the breast in breastplate.Absentee Olympus-dwelling dads and moms are the birthright of the demigods but the unfortunately named Camp Half Blood lets them get out their frustration by working on their low-tech battle skills with swords and fancy gymnastics. Nobody is who they seem at first Percy soon learns. The truth about museum guide Mr. Brunner (Pierce Brosnan) will draw unintentional snickers. He looks ridiculous. Percy Grover and Annabeth set out to mediate war among the gods who are scrapping over Zeuss missing lightning bolt which the heavenly crew is convinced Percy has pilfered. The trio journey to real-world mythic settings to look for Zeuss lost toy the best of which is a Las Vegas take on the land of the lotus-eaters.Director Chris Columbus (the Goonies and Gremlins franchises) proves he still knows how to woo a young audience 25 years into the game using plenty of pop culture references as a hook. Would Harry Potter use an iPod to battle Medusa?Uma Thurman dressed in dominatrix leather and huge wrap-around shades is delightfully over the top as the snake-haired sorceress whose glance turns victims to stone. Gorgeous despite her bad hair day Medusas headful of writhing serpents will set phobics to squirming.The computer-generated trickery of Percy Jackson which works so splendidly with Thurman is clunky in some scenes - a minotaur looks like he was imported straight from Ray Harryhausens workshop and a giant god and puny mortals scene doesnt gel at all.What does work is the enthusiasm of the young cast and the rich fantasy of Greek mythology. Together they make Percy Jackson entertaining enough but if producers are hoping they have the next Harry Potter they should be reminded lightning rarely strikes twice.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

(Courtesy Fox Film Corporation.) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday February 11 2010 339 PM Title Percy Jackson amp; the Olympians The Lightning Thief A good B-movie is nothing to scoff at which is something film fans might as well learn while theyre young. So unless theyve been spoiled by the superior likes of ""Harry Potter"" tweens and teens ought to have a blast at ""Percy Jackson amp; the Olympians The Lightning Thief."" You dont even have to be familiar with the first book in Rick Riordans popular fantasy series to enjoy Chris Columbus energetic adaptation. Likable Logan Lerman is Percy son of a human mom named Sally (Catherine Keener) and the god Poseidon (Kevin McKidd). Poseidons brother Zeus (Sean Bean) believes that Percy has stolen his lightning bolt the worlds most powerful weapon. If he doesnt get it back ASAP the consequences will be dire.Unfortunately Percy doesnt have it. In fact he has always believed he was just a regular kid. So his protector Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) takes him to a camp for other young demigods run by a centaur named Chiron (Pierce Brosnan). Here he learns about his legacy from Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario) daughter of the goddess Athena. When Percy finds out his mom was kidnapped by Hades (Steve Coogan) he sneaks out of camp with Annabeth and Grover. Their goal is to rescue Sally from the underworld but theyll have to face challenges like the snake-haired Medusa (Uma Thurman) first.Nearly all the adults are outrageously hammy a strategy that only really works for Coogan. And Craig Titleys screenplay simplifies Riordans world to such a degree that you could almost imagine the movie as a syndicated TV series. But the kids are charming their adventures fast-paced and the effects suitably loud and explosive. Just be aware that the PG rating is deceptive. The violence scares and sexual innuendo may be too much for younger siblings. In fact with an aggressively seductive Persephone (Rosario Dawson) and a Hades who rocks leather pants this is definitely not the mythology youll remember from school.Which is of course just part of the attraction.

""Percy Jackson and the Olympians The Lightning Thief"" echoes J.K. Rowlings mythological world so closely with its magical young half-bloods and crowded canvas of supporting deities that a hex must be brewing. Percy a teenage New Yorker discovers that his long-absent father a ""dazzling"" guy who vanished after impregnating his mom was none other than Poseidon god of the sea. (There are a lot of guys on the Jersey shore imitating Greek gods; this one meant it.) His heritage explains Percys ability to submerge in his high school pool for seven minutes his dyslexia (which scrambles written English but translates Greek in a flash) and his ADHD. Hes not hyper hes got finely honed battle reflexes. The same could be said for Chris Columbus director of the first two ""Harry Potter"" films who paces this film like a demolition derby. Theres a ratio of one explosion monster attack or life-and-death battle every 2.8 minutes and Columbus makes sure they detonate on time. It leaps so breathlessly from one cliffhanger to the next that the action lacks an emotional foundation. The fireballs are great but the story feels confused in its tone and direction. The characters are swiftly sketched in. Percy (played by the likable and reasonably believable Logan Lerman) is a decent sort whos understandably overprotective of his mother (Catherine Keener all wounded eyes and tender smiles) and ticked at his macho slob stepfather (Joe Pantoliano). His best friend Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) is all urban sass and urgent libido; given that hes a satyr -- goat from the waist down -- it makes sense. At a summer camp/renaissance festival where apprentice heroes train they meet Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario) an up-and-coming Xena and the trio set off on a transcontinental road trip to find a thunderbolt stolen from Zeus. The film is a meat-and-potatoes adventure enlivened by a few brief star turns. Pierce Brosnan is amiable as Percys doting schoolteacher and Sean Beans petulant Zeus fits the Greeks preference for gods who are as selfish and shortsighted as humans. The real fun arrives with Uma Thurman as Medusa. Its a strong actress who can out-emote a coiffure of writhing hissing snakes but Thurman does it. With eyes like those who needs lightning bolts? Steve Coogan and Rosario Dawson are in great form as the arrogant Hades and his bickering wife Persephone; hell as a bad marriage has never looked so vivid. And the infernos physical location on the U.S. map is a good broad joke. PERCY JACKSON AND THE OLYMPIANS THE LIGHTNING THIEF  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG for action violence and peril; scary images and suggestive material; mild language. Unfortunately theres not enough going on in the film to sustain the needed excitement. In the race to copy ""Harry Potter"" many a series pilot has been launched and crashed. Does anyone remember ""Eragon"" and ""Inkheart""? ""Percy Jackson"" is better than those but not by enough. Its technically polished spirited well intentioned but curiously lacking in magic.

Jackson left as Grover Underwood and Alexandra Daddario as Annabeth Chase star in 20th Century Foxs ""Percy Jackson amp; the Olympians The Lightning Thief.""Cant wait for a magical adventure story about a teen with mysterious parentage his funny friend and the fiercely competent girl who protects them both? Their quest to recover a powerful object confront ancient evil and maybe save the world? Well the bad news is the first part of ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" wont be out until November. Percy Jackson and the Olympians The Lightning Thief (PG) Fox (118 min.) Directed by Chris Columbus. With Logan Lerman Brandon T. Jackson Alexandra Daddario Pierce Brosnan. Now playing in New Jersey. Stephen Whittys review  three stars Rating note The film contains violence and sensuality. The good news is that ""Percy Jackson and the Olympians The Lightning Thief"" is in theaters right now. There are differences. In this story the teenage Percy is a half-mortal conceived after his mother saw a Greek god emerging from the surf at the Jersey Shore. (Hey it happens.) Now shes married to Joey Pantoliano. Talk about settling. But when a civil war erupts on Mount Olympus Percy needs to go to Olympian summer camp and get a crash course in his powers as a son of Poseidon. And then take his two new best friends - a daughter of Athena and a satyr-ical bodyguard - into hell itself. The story - taken from the inaugural novel of Rick Riordans fantasy series - clearly has a Potter vibe. The movie does too not surprisingly as its directed by Chris Columbus who launched the Hogwarts series with the first two installments. Although Columbus episodes arent as prized by fans as the ones that came later he has an ease with young actors and a fearlessness about special effects. And ""Percy Jackson"" has both in abundance. Logan Lerman is sympathetic as Percy and Alexandra Daddario is a fierce fearless role model as Annabeth. And while Brandon T. Jackson overplays the satyr (with his furry legs he looks like half of Donkey in ""Shrek"" - and is about half as funny) the cast list still has a few treats. Like Uma Thurman as Medusa (a great guest-villainess part that almost excuses her Poison Ivy in ""Batman and Robin""). Or Pierce Brosnan as a noble centaur. And the Underworld itself is wittily conceived as an aging rock stars lair with Rosario Dawsons Persephone a bored hedonist and Steve Coogans Hades an egotistic mope. The pacing is dizzying (particularly compared to the last few Potter films which took their time to set things up). Within minutes were at the high-school mythical; a few minutes more and its time to hit the highway and head to hell. (Which yes the literal Columbus scores to - ""Highway to Hell."") Fun as it can be it does feel like half-hearted Hogwarts at times. The characters and the performances - at least in this first episode - dont seem to be quite as complex (poor Catherine Keener as Percys human mother spends a lot of time standing around and looking sad). And theres not the wild invention of the J.K. Rowling books which mixed all sorts of myths and invented dozens more. This story sticks mostly to the classical canon which unfortunately can be predictable (once Medusa enters the scene you know how shes going to leave). But Medusa looks far better than she did in that old Baby Boomer horror ""The Gorgon"" and the monstrous hydra would impress even Ray Harryhausen. With great effects (and a few surprises) its a fun Saturday-matinee adventure. And if its not quite Harry Potter - yet - it could still grow into an entertaining substitute.

"Percy Jackson amp; the Olympians reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Percy Jackson amp; the Olympians reviewed. Percy Jackson amp; the Olympians reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Feb. 11 2010 512 PM Percy Jackson amp; the Olympians Derivative book meet cornball director By David Plotz Percy Jackson amp; the Olympians The Lightning Thief. With its long colon-bedecked title Percy Jackson amp; the Olympians The Lightning Thief (20th Century Fox) announces that it intends to be the first installment of a new and extremely profitable movie franchise. It aspires to fill the gap left by the looming end of the Harry Potter series and the abject failure of The Golden Compass movie. But to understand why the Percy Jackson movie must not--and will not--succeed please indulge a brief (but I suspect typical) family story. David Plotz David Plotz is the CEO of Atlas Obscura and host of the Slate Political Gabfest. My daughter was a Harry Potter junkie. She tore through the books as fast as I could read them to her. When we finished the series a couple of years ago she suffered withdrawal symptoms. The movies the imaginary Potter games--they werent enough to satisfy her cravings. Like so many other children she desperately sought other similar books to sate her Potter jones. These methadone books generally featured ordinary children who stumbled into magical powers and entered a secret usually funny alternative magical world. The Septimus Heap and Inkheart books briefly diverted her Artemis Fowl didnt. Eva Ibbotsons The Secret of Platform 13 had a good run. But nothing held her like Rick Riordans five Percy Jackson books which I read to her night after night after night for months. Advertisement The Percy Jackson books tell the story of an everyday American boy with a troubled family life who discovers hes the secret son of the Greek god Poseidon who happens to be alive and well and headquartered on Mount Olympus which occupies the 600th floor of the Empire State Building. Demigods and monsters live throughout the world masked from ordinary humans and possessing extraordinary powers. Over a series of five adventures Percy meets most of the memorable characters from Greek mythology and eventually saves the world from a devastating war between the gods and the titans. The series delighted my daughter but irritated me with its overwhelming blatant borrowing from Harry Potter. Percy is American--thats a difference. And his magic comes from Greek gods not wizards. But almost every other significant element in the books--particularly the first book The Lightning Thief--is derivative. An average boy living with a vicious bullying relative suddenly learns of his special powers and finds out that hes actually a celebrity in the magical world. (Hmm where have I heard that?) Percys quickly transported to a mysterious place where other extraordinary kids learn to harness their powers but its not Hogwarts its ""Camp Half-Blood."" Hogwarts has ""houses""; Camp Half-Blood has ""cabins."" Hogwarts has Quidditch; Camp Half-Blood has epic games of capture-the-flag. Hogwarts is supervised by a gentle bearded and mighty wizard; Camp Half-Blood by a gentle bearded and mighty centaur. Our hero--whose name even has the same rhythm as Potter (Har-ry Pot-ter; Per-cy Jack-son)--soon attracts two sidekicks. One Annabeth Chase is a book-smart girl who starts out as a rival but becomes a friend. The other Grover Underwood is goofy physically awkward and loyal. These three set out to retrieve an all-powerful magical object thats been lost (Potter sorcerers stone; Jackson lightning bolt of Zeus) confront the forces of darkness and--through courage and guile--emerge victorious. In short its a rip-off. Still since my daughter loved the books I felt it was my parental duty for us to spend a snow day at a screening of The Lightning Thief. Rarely has there been a more perfect marriage between source material and filmmaker than Percy Jackson and Chris Columbus. Derivative book meet cornball director Columbus the schlock genius behind the Home Alone movies the first two Harry Potter films (the bad ones) Stepmom Bicentennial Man and other horrors has brought his shopworn bag of tricks to Percy Jackson. The plot is a mess though to be fair to Columbus not more of a mess than the book. Briefly Percy is falsely suspected of stealing the lightning bolt sets out with Annabeth and Grover on a road trip to the Underworld battles Medusa and the Hydra tries to free his mother from Hades clutches and finally finds the bolt and returns it to Olympus. Columbus has accelerated Percy from 12 years old as he is in the book to High School Musical age and cast alarmingly sexual actors as his three leads. As Percy Logan Lermann comes off as more lost Jonas Brother than lost son of Poseidon; Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario) is more pneumatic and pillow-lipped than youd expect a daughter of chaste Athena to be. And poor Brandon T. Jackson is compelled to play Grover as a joking hip-hop sex machine. Advertisement Columbus directs with his usual frying pan to the head. Music is forever swelling majestically. Characters are always opening wide their eyes and mouths to gaze in wonder. (Look its Hermes flying shoes Look ha ha theyre basketball high-tops) Columbus is world champion of the obvious double-take Thats not a cow thats ... the Minotaur Thats not an angry security guard thats ... the Hydra Thats not ... oh forget it. There are small pleasures. Uma Thurman plays Medusa as Gloria Swanson in Sunset Blvd. Steve Coogan steals his two minutes as Hades an angry aging heavy-metal rock star. (On the other hand Columbus should be sanctioned by the directors guild for his abuse of Catherine Keener whos given such terrible dialogue as Percys mom that even she cant salvage it.) The Lightning Thief is loud scary oversexed and really unfun. All that would have been fine if my daughter liked it but instead it left her and her friend stunned. It took them half an hour and a pepperoni pizza to recover. Chris Columbus nearly suffocated the Harry Potter franchise with his leaden films of the first two books. It took Alfonso Cuaron and other directors to revive the franchise. But Percy Jackson will not be saved. These mediocre books dont deserve--and surely wont get--another chance in movie theaters.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Percy Jackson amp; the Olympians sounds like an Otis Redding cover band. It is instead an unofficial cover of the Harry Potter franchise. ""The Lightning Thief the first film in what its makers at 20th Century Fox almost certainly hope will become a series features a New York teenager named Percy Jackson (Logan Lerman) whos introduced to a world of magic demons and special effects. Very little of it is as persuasive or enveloping as its beloved English counterpart. But it works very hard to distract 11-year-olds from thinking about the November arrival of ""The Deathly Hallows.Percy discovers that the Greek gods have been walking among us and reproducing with humans for eons and that he is the demigod son of Poseidon (Kevin McKidd). Apparently Poseidons brother Zeus (Sean Bean) has had his lightning bolt stolen and if it isnt returned Zeus will declare war with his other brother Hades (Steve Coogan) against all the gods. The assumption is that Percy took the bolt. But the boy doesnt know where it is. Has anyone thought to check Harry Potters forehead?Its not long until Percys mother (Catherine Keener) has sent him to Camp Half-Blood which is run by his mythology teacher who sheds his wheelchair and turns into half-horse half-Pierce Brosnan. Among other things Percy has to collect a set of pearls and arrive at the gates of hell to rescue his mother which he does accompanied by his two friends Ron and Hermi - excuse me. Theyre a satyr named Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) and Athenas demigod daughter Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario) and as a trio all they seem to do is slay beasts which will please some young moviegoers to no end.The film is based on Rick Riordans hit Percy Jackson books (the first appeared in 2005). Riordan was a schoolteacher whose career as a popular writer began as a mystery novelist. But you get the sense that he saw his students rabidly reading J.K. Rowlings books and thought I can do that. Not so much. Watching this movie adapted by Craig Titley your appreciation for the complexity and vastness of Rowlings vision only grows. With all its cheesy effects and sylvan swordplay between kids in jeans sheaths and leather boots ""The Lightning Thief feels like a cross between ""Clash of the Titans and a renaissance faire.That Chris Columbus has been recruited to direct only compounds that ersatz ""Potter feeling. Columbus made the first pair of ""Potter movies -- the only two that could double as a couple of Ambien. His shameless jump to a rival team is a move only Brett Favre could appreciate.The new movies modern settings suit Columbus better than the intricacies of Rowlings crypto-medieval world. And yet theres something woefully uninspired about the gangs drive across the country where they find replicas of ancient Greece in say Nashville. Too much of the movie feels like a cheap imitation. Lerman acquits himself nicely. But his sharp features swept-over haircut and propensity to preen and pose suggest a somehow more adolescent Zac Efron. And Daddario might be playing Athenas little girl but that baby face and those topaz-blue eyes suggest her earth mother is Tiffany Amber Thiessen.By the time the movie arrives in Vegas for a lotus flower-fueled narcotic interlude in a casino its clear Columbus is phoning it in. He cant bother to re-create the glee of the kids high. Even the bit of the cloven-foot dancing Grover does to Lady Gaga feels mandated by the Kidz Bop crowd. Until the hormones kicked in my misgiving about the ""Harry Potter movies was that the characters didnt seem adolescent enough. By the fourth movie that started to change. In ""The Lightning Thief the kids are meant to talk like actual kids - ""Whats crackin? and ""I got this - but modern parlance has the unforeseen effect of forcing a squareness onto the proceedings.The movie has a few adult pleasures. As Persephone Rosario Dawson is a woman who knows a ridiculous sexual metaphor when she touches one. And Uma Thurman pockets the movie playing Medusa as if Marlene Dietrich thought she was Gloria Swanson. When Medusa tells Percy ""I used to date your daddy she adds an entirely new meaning to the Poseidon adventure.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Share Tweet Surely somewhere out there there are fans of the first two Harry Potter movies who were bereft when Chris Columbus didnt go on to direct subsequent entries in the franchise. Those few jilted fans can now line up for their methadone in the form of Percy Jackson amp; The Olympians The Lightning Thief a kids-book adaptation that follows the J.K. Rowling formula closely enough to ease the pangs of forlorn Harry Potter fans in general. Theres the Chosen One kid with school problems and a sad home life who learns that his parentage lends him magical powers far beyond those of his better-schooled peers. Theres his hapless and sometimes helpful boon companion and their super-smart prickly girl ally. Theres the special school (in this case a camp) where they go to hone their special powers. Theres the giant threat that has all the adults stymied which sends the Chosen One and his best buds on a quest to save the day. And in Columbus hands it once again all breaks down into a series of rushed breathless special-effects setpieces in a thrill ride that isnt headed anywhere new. As kid adventures go The Lightning Thief isnt awful; if nothing else it (and the Rick Riordan book it dumbs down and slicks up) might serve as a gateway into further reading in Greek mythology. Protagonist/Chosen One Percy Jackson (Logan Lerman) is the son of Poseidon and just one of a huge wave of new demigods spawned by randy Greek gods and left to make their own way on Earth in part under the tutelage of a weary-looking Pierce Brosnan as Chiron the centaur. Percys quest to return lightning to Zeus (Sean Bean) leads him and his friends into conflict with the likes of a hydra Medusa (Uma Thurman) and Hades and Persephone (Steve Coogan and Rosario Dawson). The modern-day updates of these old myths are minor and not particularly imaginative--Coogan plays Hades as a strutting Alice Cooper type while Percy uses the reflective surface of an iPhone as a mirror to avoid looking Medusa in the eye--but at least Riordans books have a rich background to serve as source material for the storys chases and swordfights. That said Columbus adaptation is obvious and clumsy with the characters dutifully overexplaining every thought and emotion and the soundtrack choices making weak jokes that arent worth the effort. (Did someone just mention the highway to hell? Cue ""Highway To Hell"" Characters going to Vegas? Time for ""Poker Face"") The effects are impressive but they stream by with only momentary impact given how common this kind of spectacle has become. Like The Spiderwick Chronicles Bridge To Terabithia City Of Ember and other recent CGI-heavy kid-lit film adaptations Percy Jackson is mostly a reasonable distraction for bored kids but also a reminder that the source material is almost always more flavorful and fulfilling than derivative work.

Greek mythology gets a modern update in ""Percy Jackson amp; the Olympians The Lightning Thief"" yet another kidlit adaptation hoping to steal some of Harry Potters thunder. Loosely based on book one of Rick Riordans five-volume series ""Thief"" introduces Poseidons half-human love child who battles a Minotaur Medusa and a five-headed Hydra to avert a global gods-must-be-crazy crisis. With Chris Columbus at the helm ""Lightning"" strikes many of the same notes as his earlier ""Potter"" efforts (outsider hero episodic plotting high-energy finale) though the deja-vu approach should lure a decent fraction of that franchises aud for a fraction of its budget. Zeus master bolt has gone missing but the primary suspect Percy (Logan Lerman) doesnt have much of a motive when the film opens. Not until a field trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art where Percy is attacked by a winged Fury does the dyslexic teen learn of his unlikely lineage Turns out his mother (Catherine Keener) hooked up with Poseidon who was forced to abandon his spawn by an unfair Olympian decree. Seventeen years later (boosted from the books 12) someone is trying to turn the gods against each other by framing young Percy with the theft of Zeus prized possession. Columbus who so deftly dealt with divorce in ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" attempts to stir up a fresh set of adolescent emotions with Percys broken-family backstory (Joe Pantoliano plays Moms boorish boyfriend). However though Lerman was quite promising in ""310 to Yuma"" and ""Hoot"" here he falls back on the soapy acting style of his big break WB skein ""Jack and Bobby."" Lerman can square his jaw and furrow his brow with the best of them but that doesnt cut it when trying to convey something as mythic as grappling with ones true identity. Where Harry Potter had Hogwarts Percy Jackson gets his demigod training from Camp Half-Blood overseen by resident centaur Chiron (Pierce Brosnan). Like Percys best friend Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) who uses crutches to disguise his identity as a garbage-eating satyr Chiron moves around by wheelchair outside camp -- an interesting concept that when combined with Percys dyslexia and ADHD suggests that such challenges may actually mask supernatural abilities. In the book Riordan went to great lengths to imagine contempo roles for key figures of Greek mythology though screenwriter Craig Titley largely avoids the notion that clues to the gods ongoing presence exist right under our noses. Instead he streamlines the plot pairing Percy with half-goat Grover and Athenas daughter Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario whos more kick-ass Xena than bookworm Hermione) on a cross-country odyssey that brings him face-to-face with Medusa (a vampy Uma Thurman) and several other labors -- watered down considerably since Hercules day. Percy may be older than he was in the book but the material still skews young (despite several risque asides). Columbus generates genuine energy during action scenes from the Minotaur showdown to a life-or-death game of capture-the-flag at camp but his overall vision for the property falls far short of iconic and the digital effects have the cheesy look of so many low-budget SyFy TV movies. Where limitations in CG technology forced the helmer to go the ""Jaws"" route in ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" (suggesting rather than showing much of the magic) here he tries to give auds an eyeful. Its not until well past the halfway mark that the movie really clicks in firing up with a visit to Las Vegas imaginary Lotus Hotel (how ""Pinocchios"" Island of Lost Boys might have looked had Disney designed it today) followed by a CG-intensive but largely suspense-free encounter with Hades (a Mick Jagger-styled Steve Coogan) in the underworld. Titley scraps the books big climax and focuses on a spectacular new showdown atop the Empire State Building (gateway to Mount Olympus in the books revised mythology). Action movies of this scale often start off strong and wind down to forgettable finales but ""Percy Jackson"" is the opposite overcoming a clunky setup to deliver nearly all its thrills in the last half-hour. With competition from Tim Burtons ""Alice in Wonderland"" just weeks away at the box office the pic will have to score fast to generate any hopes of a bigscreen sequel though as potential franchise starters go the film stands on its own and should sustain repeat viewing on homevid. Hit-and-miss vfx aside tech credits are pro. Sound design is especially strong though the material deserves a more memorable score than the one ""The Hangovers"" Christophe Beck conjures.

Percy Jackson amp; the Olympians The Lightning Thief  1/2 Director Chris Columbus. Cast Logan Lerman Brandon T. Jackson Alexandra Daddario. Rating PG for action violence and peril scary images suggestive material and mild language. RELATED Swords and sandals Family fantasy films Most obviously its not ""Harry Potter"" (though its directed by Chris Columbus who directed the first two movies in that franchise). The ""Potter"" films have gotten more complex as the story goes on (and as theyve moved to different directors). Here were at the starting point. Then theres the star. Logan Lerman the Percy of the title is not Zac Efron despite a remarkable resemblance both physically and in the way he carries himself. Whatever star presence Efron possesses - among a certain age group its considerable - Lerman seems more than willing to ride its coattails. Thats OK. ""Percy Jackson"" isnt a great movie but its a good one trotting out kernels of Greek mythology like so many Disney Channel references. For the most part it works. And Lermans a likable-enough fellow as he goes from high-school nobody to world-saving demigod hero. Percy is a regular kid so far as he knows though he is unusually comfortable in the water. Hes slogging along in high school putting most of his effort into trying to convince his mother (the great Catherine Keener seemingly sentenced to play nothing but moms anymore) to dump his bum of a stepfather (Joe Pantoliano); his own father has been absent for some time. How about that. An odd violent turn of events with a substitute teacher in a history museum reveals Percys true nature He is the son of Poseidon god of the seas. Poseidons brother Zeus has had his thunderbolts his greatest weapon stolen. He means to get them back and the word on the street - and in the skies - is that Percy is the thief. Thats news to Percy. Then again so is everything else. His best friend Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) is in reality a satyr and his protector while one of his teachers Mr. Brunner is actually Chiron (Pierce Brosnan) a centaur. Grover takes Percy to a camp where the other demigods - half-god half-human - live and train for battle. But its not without cost Percys mom is abducted by a minotaur and handed over to Hades (Steve Coogan). Meanwhile Percy develops a thing for Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario) the butt-kicking daughter of Athena. She Grover and Percy decide to set out on their own for the underworld to free Percys mom from Hades who rules his lair rather like a classic rock star gone to seed (complete with guitar and wall of amps). Gods are not permitted to contact their human offspring so every kid at the camp as one demigod puts it has daddy issues. Thats dealt with to some degree (its always nice to see Kevin McKidd who plays Poseidon) but its clumsy leaden. ""Percy Jackson"" is much better when its on the move its young heroes fighting computer-generated hydras and such. An extended set piece in which they must deal with Medusa (Uma Thurman) is particularly fun. Bonus points also for the location of the underworld Hollywood. A remake of ""Clash of the Titans"" is due to hit theaters later this year making this a potentially big year for the sword-and-sandal set. At the very least ""Percy Jackson"" whets our appetite for that. But its a perfectly palatable movie in its own right. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.
