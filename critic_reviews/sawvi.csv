Somebody tried to explain the plot of Saw III or IV to me once and it took a half-hour--this film presumably like its predecessors is a bumblefuck involving a serial killer Jigsaw (a thin-lipped Tobin Bell now intoning from beyond the grave) who devises Fear Factor ""The Pit and the Pendulum""-style deadly dilemmas for his victims. Taken just as an objet dart Saw VI--gray grisly solemn stupid--would be about the most dismal thing Ive ever laid eyes on the argument against film preservation but it vaults into the realm of real detestability through pretensions of relevance having Jigsaw go after faddish bad guys such as usurers made to cut their own pound of flesh and a team of insurance company employees looking out for the bottom line. Yes Saw VI youre a vehicle for positive social action. Suggested plot for the inevitable Saw VII Jigsaw captures and tortures ""artists"" and studio execs who have money and access to a supple potentially transcendent and ennobling medium but instead make a lot of Saw movies.

Squeezing another pint of blood from its torture-porn corpus Lionsgate slays again with ""Saw VI"" a film so frighteningly familiar it could well be called ""Saw It Already."" At least the requisite moralism is more playful than pious in this edition whose grotesque punishments extend even to a man guilty of (horrors) cigarette smoking. Serial not only in terms of killing the ""Saw"" franchise has essentially become a gory soap opera its die-hard viewership addicted to following the entangled narrative viscera of Jill (Betsy Russell) Det. Lt. Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) and of course Jigsaw (Tobin Bell). Deceased since ""III"" but still calling the shots from beyond the grave the diabolically vengeful Jigsaw aka John is given an added grudge in ""VI"" as flashbacks show he was threatened with the cancellation of his health insurance. (Not even mass murderers are immune to HMOs.) That explains the viciously elaborate series of traps set for Umbrella Health executive William (Peter Outerbridge) whos forced to feel the gravity of choosing one patients life over anothers. The pics most memorably gruesome contraption is a spinning carousel with half a dozen of the executives colleagues on it; of those only two are permitted to escape death by shotgun blast. Other arguably deserving victims in this most topical of ""Saw"" sequels include a pair of predatory lenders forced to sever their own body parts and weigh them on a scale. As crudely fixated on ultraviolent vigilante justice as anything in the series (the proverbial ""pound of flesh"" is made literal here) this sequence begins the movie on an aptly torturous note. Key revelations in ""VI"" include the contents of the box Jigsaw willed to his widow Jill -- who in an obvious lead-in to the seventh installment appears to be vying with Hoffman for the right to carry out the dead killers sick bidding from here. Meantime Hoffmans attempt to pin all post-Jigsaw murders on the late Peter Strahm -- crushed to death in a giant trash compactor at the end of ""V"" -- isnt working for the newly healed and still-vigilant Agent Perez (Athena Karkanis). As Jigsaws kindred victim-turned-vindicator Mandylor has significantly less screen time than he did in the talky ""V"" which benefits the new movie considerably. Flashbacks allow Shawnee Smith to reprise her role as Jigsaw accomplice Amanda but the new performance is a cut below her surgical work in ""III."" Russell doesnt do much but prepare to accept a larger part in ""VII."" Bell might appear to be tiring of Jigsaw though its hard to tell since the films flashbacks center on the psychos cancerous final days. Presumably owing to director Kevin Greuterts work as editor of all five previous ""Saw"" pics the films juggling of chronology is the franchises best -- ""downright slick"" as Jigsaw would say. Still whatever technical improvements ""Saw VI"" makes on earlier entries can only be seen as marginal in the context of a series that remains as revolting as its fans would seem to insist.

In the opening sequence of Saw VI two parasitical bureaucrats of the pre-crash American economy -- the implication is that theyre subprime mortgage vendors -- pay for their sins and compete for survival by seeing which one can lop off a weightier portion of body parts before a timer runs out. The pudgy white guy saws away at his belly fat but the fierce black woman is way ahead of him -- she grabs a butcher knife and hacks hacks hacks off her forearm easily outdoing his measly pound of flesh. The fact that each one makes the choice to suffer (rather than die) is the key to the sadomasochistic appeal of the Saw films. The characters effective collaboration in the series pain games plays as a metaphor for those of us in the audience who have all made the choice to get off on these mutilation-porn theatrics. John Cramer (Tobin Bell) the Jigsaw puppeteer and twinkly-eyed sadist-mechanic-ringleader of the Saw series was killed off several installments ago but thanks to the miracle of pre-taped torture-play instructions he seems busier in death than he ever was in life. His mission in Saw VI is to teach a lesson to William (Peter Outerbridge) the CEO of a health-insurance company who hides his lust for profit behind a welter of fake smiles and byzantine actuarial data. Its fine that the producers of the series have come up with some topical bad guys but Id be remiss in my duty as a critic if I didn?t write the following sentence The trouble with Saw VI is that it never devises cool enough ways to torture people. Where are the baroquely jaw-dropping (if not jaw-snapping) De Sadean Rube Goldberg contraptions? At one point the CEO has to decide which of his six underlings all strapped to a carousel will live or die (the game is supposed to reveal to him that in his insurance work hes really playing God) but since we dont give a hoot about any of them and the method of death is unremarkable the sequence is a dud. So is the rest of the movie. Saw VI is the thinnest draggiest and most tediously preachy of the Saw films. Its the first one thats more or less consumed by backstory -- which is to say its one of those hollow franchise placeholders in which far too many fragments from the previous sequels keep popping up in flashbacks. If your goal is to do a quick study for a round of Saw Trivial Pursuit then this may be the movie for you. If youre looking to be jolted into fear or queasy laughter skip this sequel and hope that the producers get their sick act together next time.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + ""Saw 3D had to go there. Well it had to try. A few body parts make their way toward you. Drops of digital blood -- theres rarely another kind anymore -- float in the middle of the screen. But if were to believe posters heralding a final chapter this is a pitiful goodbye. This series never cared for filmmaking. It never cared for human life. Now it doesnt even care for its audience or itself scraping together the gist of the other movies simply in order to have something to sell for Halloween.This is both the most gruesome and least coherent of the seven movies. Thats saying something. Crucial information has somehow been written legibly on teeth that must be extracted. The victim must be taught a lesson -- hes promoting a fraudulent book about how he survived Jigsaw the series killer that Tobin Bells been playing from the start -- so no Novocain for him. How about for us? The 3-D hurts to look at. Surely the urge to tear out our own eyes is part of the fun. These movies have made more than a half billion dollars none of which appears to have been reinvested in the franchise. They still have the polish of a rusty nail.It feels contractually obligated. Thats because in part it is. The director Kevin Greutert wanted to make ""Paranormal Activity 2 but was required to stick around here. This is the movie of a man who knew what he was missing.The dismemberment and torture are now shtick. The filmmakers -- ""Saw veterans -- struggle to imbue this movie with the usual righteousness. The heath care thread in last years installment suggested the series could be reborn as a vengeful jeremiad. But here we are now with those glasses looking at the same old same-old -- not to sound too jaded but we saw death-by-crematory in an earlier episode. The entire affair reeks of desperation and spite.Several of the ""games as theyre called are just randomly jammed into the proceedings. That episodic approach works for an equally indigestible far more innovative series like ""Jackass. So does 3-D. This ""Saw installment seems desperate to extend the movie to a legitimate 90 minutes. In a very early sequence a young woman is suspended above a buzz saw. Her crime was having two lovers who now have the option to kill one another or agree to raise the saw up and eliminate her. In front of a camera-phone-wielding crowd no less. Not much later a gang of racist punks has been rounded up and rigged for group destruction in a rusty garage. Jigsaw died of cancer a few movies ago but flashbacks and new games inexplicably keep him alive. This alleged final edition trashes the perverse morality of his legacy to make him the Jerry Springer of gore.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Saw has shown a ferocious unwillingness to evolve. Once the huge grosses started rolling in plenty of franchises would upgrade to better actors pricier screenwriters and production values that didnt fall somewhere between a Roger Corman cheapie and a snuff film. But the producers behind the Saw films are understandably reluctant to mess with a winning formula. Each entry feels more or less like the last. Theyre seemingly filmed on the same grungy dirty barely lit set reusing the same generic-looking C-list actors. And in a particularly stubborn act of willful water-treading they continue to prominently feature Tobin Bell as the mischievous moralistic protagonist even though his character died several sequels ago. In Saw 3D the eighth and ostensibly last series installment David Cassidy look-alike/Boondock Saint Sean Patrick Flanery plays a bestselling author whos made a fortune off an inspirational book in which he fictitiously recounts having survived one of Bells deadly traps. Saw makes its victims suffer for even the most minor transgressions so Bells flunkies cook up a punishing test for Flanery to fit the severity of his crime. In order to save his beloved wife Flanery must make his way through a series of deadly traps involving his friends and handlers. Meanwhile series veteran Betsy Russell playing Bells traumatized ex goes to the police and dimes out Bell accomplice/law-enforcement agent Costas Mandylor who sets about enacting revenge the only way he knows through a series of gruesome traps. Bells minions continue to behave like the worlds grisliest life coaches. They even use the touchy-feely language of therapy-speak; traps are designed specifically to teach Flanery important lessons about reexamining his priorities and valuing his loved ones. Successories-style sentiments get joined to low-rent gore maddeningly redundant setpieces and an arbitrary police procedural about a hotshot detective intent on taking Mandylor down. With the possible exception of Final Destination no horror franchise is as devoted to cheap gimmicks and no gimmick is more ubiquitous these days than 3-D. But Saw 3D does little with the technology; even in 3-D the film looks flat. This entry is being billed as the series closer and as a tiny change of pace but dont believe the hype. Saw 3D offers the same old overwrought laughably melodramatic shit only this time in one more dimension.

Joe Neumaier Friday October 23 2009 244 PM Title Saw VI A serial killers deadly interlocking games continue. With Tobin Bell Costas Mandylor. (131) R Graphic horror. At area theaters.Just in time for the health care debate -- oops make that Halloween -- comes ""Saw VI"" which may or not help the public option push through but certainly gives that phrase some new graphic bloody meaning.Just as the James Bond films had their pre-title sequences so this new ""Saw"" begins with a quick ""test"" from the killer Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) who died a few films back in the series but is seen frequently in this years entry via flashbacks and visions. Two employees guilty of predatory lending are forced to pay for their crime of helping folks who cant repay loan go into debt. Lets just say its gonna cost someone an arm and a leg.Eventually the scowling Det. Hoffmann (Costas Mandylor) formerly a pursuer of Jigsaw and then an accomplice emerges as one of the people helping to keep the dead mans demented dream alive To force the real ghouls of society to either pay for their sins come face to face with their impact on the world or learn to appreciate their own life. (These movies have to be a favorite of Dexter Morgan from Showtimes ""Dexter."")All of those are eventually presented to the coldhearted vice president of a health insurance company (Mark Rolston) who had once turned John ""Jigsaw"" Kramer down when a cancer-treatment procedure could have prevented his death. Now as Hoffman -- under scrutiny himself by the police -- and Kramers widow Jill (Betsy Russell) put the wheels into place for a vicious new ""game"" the VP that callously canceled patients insurance due to ""pre-existing conditions"" has to live and maybe die with blood on his hands (and everywhere else).If youre a fan of these films you know that you go for the complex hoops Jigsaw puts his victims through the oblique moral code and the way Tobin Bell pours menace and melancholy into the most common villains dialogue. If youre not a fan youll wonder why this horror series is so successful (though not as much as when the series was fresh; box office attendance has dropped regularly since 2006s ""Saw III""). After all with the ludicrous Rube Goldberg-style contraptions clumsily interlocking storylines murky industrial-grade cinematography and mostly Z-list actors (Russell played Angel in 1985s ""Avenging Angel"" Cameo-ing costar Shawnee Smith was a voice in a ""Grand Theft Auto"" videogame Costas Mandylor is well Costas Mandylor) these movies lack a whole lot of panache.But they do often pack a punch especially in the gore department and in that area this ""American Idol"" of torture porn doesnt disappoint. Is it enjoyable? No. But Michael Moore may want to steal some of Jigsaws techniques the next time he takes on the health care industry.
