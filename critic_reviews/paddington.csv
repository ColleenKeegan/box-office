This big-screen adaptation of Michael Bonds classic adorable childrens-book character -- an exceedingly polite klutzy talking bear from ""darkest Peru"" -- takes what could have been an easy cash-grab and turns it into a generous fun ingenious little comedy. Its the kind of movie that turns critics like me into advertising copywriters Go see it Your kids will love it Fun for adults and children alike Et cetera I was never well-versed in the Paddington Bear stories but the outline of the film appears to stick to Bonds original setup silly and sad in equal measure. After his habitat is destroyed our young bear-hero travels from Peru to London with a suitcase filled with nothing but marmalade on the advice of his Aunt Lucy who assures him that the British have a long tradition of taking care of children displaced by war (a reference to both the EuropeanA emigresA who came to England during the war as well as the British children who became refugees during the Blitz -- which was reportedly Bonds own inspiration for Paddington). In London hes temporarily taken in by the Brown family who are at first divided over what to do with this well-behaved but horrifically clumsy creature. Dad Henry (Hugh Bonneville) a careful insurance analyst who knows the exact amount of risk involved in everything (""34 percent of pre-breakfast accidents involve bannisters"" he yells at his son as the boy slides down the stairs) is skeptical. However the always colorfully clad mom Mary (the enchanting Sally Hawkins) a childrens illustrator loves the idea of having a cute talking bear around. The kids are torn too Judy (Madeline Harris) is an easily embarrassed teen and doesnt want anything to do with the stupid talking bear while younger Jonathan (Samuel Joslin) is a budding inventor and wannabe-astronaut and wants a playmate.A Looking to find a permanent home for Paddington the Browns attempt to locate an explorer who had discovered Paddingtons habitat decades ago (and from whom his red hat and love of marmalade comes from). Little do they know a cruel taxidermist (played by Nicole Kidman having the time of her life and sporting an unusually fetching blonde bob) has also become fascinated by this bear and wants him for her ... [cue ominous music] ...A collection. The plot is all predictable broad-strokes stuff -- I mean its basicallyA Mary PoppinsA meetsA E.T.A meets 101 Dalmatians but with a talking bear -- but the inspired comic setpieces set the movie apart. The bear has a penchant for causing any number of rolling Rube Goldberg-esque calamities often involving everyday objects (handi-vacs toilets skateboards TV antennas etc.) and the films freewheeling slapstick spirit is fairly irresistible. This kind of elaborate physical humor can be tough to pull off; the graveyards are full of childrens movies that drowned in their own shrill ornamentation. But director Paul King constructs his scenes with expert timing and precision He deftly dribbles little bits of information about whats going where efficiently establishing the right spatial dynamics then lets us anticipate the catastrophe to come. It all looks effortless but its not. Its also funny as hell. Meanwhile the films portrait of London is perched halfway between the modern and the fablelike a place of huge crowds imposing buildings and portentous skies. (Early on we briefly see the city in a snow globe and the film seems to have bought into that aesthetic.) It all fits beautifully together. Many adaptations of childrens stories nowadays try too hard to contemporize themselves or to add hefty doses of realism -- all in an (oft-misguided) effort to find some edge. But from its black-and-white newsreel opening to its world of dollhouses that transform into real houses and its color-coded everyday objects that become marvelous sources of both chaos and inventionA Paddington is decidedly proudly unhip. Its a lovely endearing chocolate-box of a movie.A A The piece originally inaccurately said the creator of the Paddington series was Michael Brown not Michael Bond.

"Paddington movie reviewed Adaptation of childrens book is surprisingly good. Slate Sign In Sign Up You Wont Need a Second Screen to Stay Happy During the Surprisingly Wonderful Paddington You Wont Need a Second Screen to Stay Happy During the Surprisingly Wonderful Paddington Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Jan. 16 2015 527 PM A Very Rare Sort of Movie Paddington is an unexpected delight. By Dan Kois Paddington and his dog in Paddington. Courtesy of StudioCanal These chilly winter months my general feeling about childrens movies can be expressed in four simple words make more of them I would take my kids to a new movie every weekend of January and February if only there were supply to meet our demand. Dan Kois Dan Kois is Slates culture editor and co-host of Mom and Dad Are Fighting and a contributing writer to the New York Times Magazine. He is writing a book called How to Be a Family. Of course that doesnt mean I like all the childrens movies we see. Even in our current golden age there are not enough Pixar and Laika and Ghibli productions to go around so sometimes I seize the opportunity of a childrens movie to sleep--or if the movies too aggressively loud and stupid to sleep to play a game on my phone. (Parents at crappy childrens movies are exempt from all public shaming about texting in the theater. I will brook no argument on this topic.) So I would be happy about the existence of Paddington the new live-action take on the floppy-hatted British bear even if it werent any good. Not having read Michael Bonds series of books as a child I have no real allegiance to the character though I guess Id be vaguely disappointed if Paddington were a travesty. But I was just glad to have a movie to take my kids to on a frigid Saturday morning. Advertisement What a pleasant surprise then to be able to report that Paddington is a wonder warm gentle well-acted funny without being stupid. Directed by Paul King best known for helming the cult-favorite British television series The Mighty Boosh Paddington is also visually stylish and inventive in a way that many live-action childrens movies dont bother to be. You wont need a second screen to stay happy during Paddington and your kids will love it even more than you do. Opening with a cheeky fake black-and-white newsreel set in ""Darkest Peru"" Paddington introduces a species of talking bears discovered long ago by a British explorer. Years later those same bears have taught their nephew young Paddington that the ideal state of existence is that of a cozy midcentury Brit complete with a love of marmalade and a stockpile of polite things to say about the rain. When an earthquake destroys the little familys jungle home Paddington (created in CGI and voiced by Ben Whishaw who replaced Colin Firth late in the production process) is sent off to London in search of a new family and a new home. The struggle of modern parents to get out of their helicopters is one of the central issues of Paddington. Its in Paddington Station of course that the little bear meets the Browns who against the objections of their uptight patriarch (Hugh Bonneville) bring him to their Notting Hill flat. The screenplay by King and Hamish McColl elegantly introduces the Browns and their individual issues Mrs. Brown (the deeply empathetic and sweet Sally Hawkins) is nurturing and warm but creatively frustrated; daughter Judy (Madeleine Harris) is embarrassed by everything her mother does including bringing home a bear; son Jonathan (Samuel Joslin) yearns for adventure but is hemmed in by his risk-analyst father whos prone to declaring ""Seven percent of all childhood accidents begin with jumping."" The struggle of modern parents to get out of their helicopters is one of the central issues in Paddington and one that will resonate with children and parents alike. (In a very funny flashback we see a long-haired wild Mr. Brown drive pregnant Mrs. Brown to the hospital on a motorcycle; the next day suit-clad he picks her and the new baby up in a Volvo.) ""Whats the point of them being happy if theyre not safe?"" Mr. Brown asks plaintively but the movie argues that a world in which say police get called when kids walk home alone is not one in which those kids can grow up independent and resilient. This is true even though the kids (and the bear) in Paddington face real peril in the form of a diabolical museum curator with an eye toward catching and stuffing a prize specimen. This villain is played by Nicole Kidman with an icy cruelty that made my daughter marvel ""Shes really good at being an evil villain isnt she?"" (My daughters never seen To Die For.) Kidmans willingness to get silly is matched by the rest of the films human cast including Julie Walters as the Browns hard-drinking housekeeper Peter Capaldi as a meddlesome neighbor and Jim Broadbent as a twinkly shopkeeper. Kings direction is bright and energetic using clever visual effects not only to bring the title character to life but to fancifully illustrate the human characters lives as well. The Browns home is frequently presented as a kind of diorama each of its inhabitants living in his or her own little world; a mural of a cherry tree winding up alongside the homes central staircase blooms or goes bare depending on the familys collective mood. Kings inventive direction presents London as a kind of wonderland full of adventure and excitement and mystery. And its a city that in this movies humane view still welcomes outsiders of all kinds whether theyre from darkest Peru or any other part of the world. The movie is punctuated with calypso music of the type popular (as the director has pointed out) among Notting Hills predominantly West Indian population at the time Michael Bond was first writing the Paddington books. D Lime the band of calypso pros assembled with Damon Albarns help for the movie makes frequent appearances on city streets performing merrily or gloomily as the scene requires. The London of Paddington is just this kind of place a place infused with a little bit of magic a place where those who most need assistance are embraced and a place youll enjoy visiting with your kids--maybe more than one wintry Saturday in a row.

Photo Credit StudioCanal advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A small bear with excellent manners arrives in London. Rated PG. BOTTOM LINE A respectable screen version of Michael Bonds classic childrens books. CAST Hugh Bonneville Nicole Kidman Sally Hawkins Ben Whishaw LENGTH 129 ""A Bear Called Paddington"" the 1958 book by Michael Bond that became an enduring franchise told the story of a well-mannered little bear who travels from Peru to London and is adopted by the Brown family. Named for the station where hes found Paddington is British through and through inspired partly by the thousands of school-age children evacuated by train from London during World War II. ""Paddington"" written and directed by Paul King arrives on American movie screens Friday following a successful 122 million run overseas. ""Paddington"" has much to recommend it starting with its fine cast. Sally Hawkins plays the kindly Mrs. Brown Hugh Bonneville her joyless husband (a role akin to George Banks in ""Mary Poppins"") and the great Julie Walters sauces up the role of Mrs. Bird the familys housekeeper. The Brown children (Samuel Joslin and Madeleine Harris) however remain rather underdeveloped characters. advertisement | advertise on newsday If youve ever wondered about Paddingtons backstory the movie provides one. It opens with a black-and-white newsreel of an English explorer who is stunned to discover that the Peruvians -- or at least the bears -- are intelligent. This is one of the films best and funniest ideas a gentle send-up of the colonialism in childrens books from ""Babar"" to Rudyard Kipling. It also resurfaces later in a clever way. Kings script doesnt always meet that same high standard. The ""Paddington"" books were mostly just a series of amusing disasters (much like H.A. Reys ""Curious George"" books) and the film faithfully follows suit. These set pieces can get a bit repetitive but things liven up when Nicole Kidman appears as Millicent a crazed taxidermist in go-go boots and a stripper wig. Shes a wonderfully absurd villain and Kidmans sexy-scary performance -- possibly the sole reason for the films PG rating -- is a real treat. One nagging problem is the visual rendering of Paddington himself. Paddington is a computer-animated creation who has the plump stature of a cartoon figure but the moist eyes and pink mouth of a real animal. The in-between effect can be disconcerting. Paddingtons lovability is due largely to Ben Whishaw who gives him the voice of a friendly sensitive schoolboy. 224 MoviesPaddington trailer Young viewers however probably wont quibble. ""Paddington"" may not have the makings of a classic but its smarter and better-crafted than the average childrens movie.

Let me get you more tea. Two lumps yes? And maybe a nice piece of shortbread? ""Paddington"" is definitely that sort of film -- a mostly old-fashioned very British story just made for blustery days and cardigans and pleasantly whiling away an hour-and-a-half with a small child. Based on the beloved series of childrens books its about a tiny orphaned bear ""from darkest Peru"" who ends up literally shipped off to London where he arrives at Paddington station with little more than his hat and a battered suitcase. Luckily hes taken in by the very nice humans who make up the Brown family. And his rather modest very sweet adventures begin. The books are best known in England (here were more acquainted with the inevitable merchandise) so its appropriate that this production hails from there too as does most of its cast and crew. Sally Hawkins is Mrs. Brown the bears endlessly patient and sympathetic foster mom; Nicole Kidman is Millicent our Cruella De Vil style villainess while Peter Capaldi pops up as Mr. Curry the Browns occasionally cranky neighbor. And the rest of the troupe rivals a Harry Potter film in offering full employment to beloved British character actors -- Jim Broadbent Julie Walters and Imelda Staunton among them. Purists will note that the action has been rather furiously amped up. In the original storybooks Paddingtons adventures were decidedly toddler-friendly and extremely low-key; in one tale he helped someone search for their lost zucchini. (No seriously.) That wont quite do for 95 minutes of big-screen entertainment so -- understandably if a bit regrettably -- the movie has created the nasty Kidman character who wants to see the little talking bear stuffed and put in a museum exhibit. This could be a bit horrifying to small children not least because they may already have their own stuffed Paddingtons. (The female archetypes the film traffics in -- the evil beauty in great shoes and high fashion the plain nice mom in sensible cottons -- are also corny at best.) But until the movie devolves into the obligatory chase scenes last-minute stand-offs and fervent speeches about family its really a rather winning (and faithful) re-creation of the childrens stories with Hawkins at her winsome best and Ben Whishaw (a last-minute substitution for Colin Firth) capturing the bears befuddled voice. Find yourself a small child and go -- but be sure to stop for tea and biscuits after. Ratings note The film contains some mild peril. Paddington (PG) Dimension/TWC (95 min.) Directed by Paul King.

Brad Wheeler The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jan. 16 2015 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Jan. 16 2015 1200AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Paul King Written by Paul King Hamish McColl Starring Ben Whishaw Hugh Bonneville and Sally Hawkins Nicole Kidman Julie Walters Jim Broadbent Peter Capaldi Classification G Country USA Language English This is not only a dandy playful movie about a talking bear but one that gives pause for thought too.Paddington is the titular anthropomorphic cub a hat-wearing home-seeking little guy who is familiar to those who have read the Paddington Bear series of childrens stories by the Berkshire-bred Michael Bond. The bear is adorable and quite the handful in a mostly live-action film that concerns his stowaway trip from the ""darkest Peru"" to London where a family (ostensibly temporarily) takes him in. Video Video Globe Styles hits and misses from the Golden Globes red carpet Imaginatively presented and clever of story Paddington wins with sweetness and message. We have a family led by a patriarch (Hugh Bonneville) who is overly careful and absolutely wary of a bear in his house. And for good reason The fuzzy charmer is a walking calamity who causes the type of minor fires and bathroom flooding that put the familys house insurance policies to the test. That being said the home is enlivened by Paddingtons agreeable manner and adventurous nature to the point where a family of four set in its ways receives a needed bump from its comfort zone even as the somewhat-civilized animal tests their patience.Director and co-writer Paul King sparks up the story from its cozy intentions deftly adding a comment on xenophobia. Noticing the arrival of a Peruvian bear to a properly staid middle-class street a nosy neighbour (Peter Capaldi) worries about ""jungle music"" and ""all-night picnics."" As well here and there a calypso band pops up smiling big even in the rain and the anti-immigration lobby is gently poked.Beyond all that what we have are high jinks and intrigue as Paddington (voiced by Ben Whishaw) attempts to track down Montgomery Clyde the explorer who years earlier discovered a pair of rare tree-dwelling talking bears in the South American jungle. The right-good chap left the ursine couple to their marmalade-loving domesticity but not before throwing them his hat and a promise about the welcoming nature of Londoners should they ever decide to leave the semi-wilds.Later after an earthquake destroys their habitat Paddingtons aunt sends her nephew off to London in search of a new home. The culture clash gives the story its colour along with the occasion for puns - a GPS device gives the instruction to ""bear left"" - that are corny but bearable.Of the youngish family of four the mother is the most soulful. Shes played by the talented Sally Hawkins whose turn here is charmingly and skillfully animated.The villain is a taxidermist who is lethally impatient not willing to wait until a creature dies a natural death before she stuffs it. Shes played by none other than a blond-bobbed Nicole Kidman dressed to kill in a lab coat (or a snakeskin body suit) and outstandingly accurate with a blowgun.Things end on an upbeat with an unusually illegal immigrant not only finding a home but enriching it with a multicultural lesson - ""In London nobodys alike which means everyone fits in"" - that is confident. Quite the bear hug all in all.

The explorer taught the bears all things British including a love of orange marmalade.Years later the descendant of those bears decides to visit London. Somehow he ends up at Paddington station where he meets the Brown family -- risk-averse father (Bonneville) sympathetic mother (Hawkins) and their children Judy (Madeleine Harris) and Jonathan (Samuel Joslin). Taking pity on the bear -- and dubbing him Paddington (Ben Whishaw) -- the family brings him home despite Fathers protests.This is more than a fish-out-of-water story -- its a bear-in-London story. Paddington has no experience with civilization so even a visit to a bathroom is fraught with comic potential much less a walk down the street.For the most part though people just act like a small bear speaking with a British accent is no big deal although a neighbor of the Browns does blanch at the thought of all-night picnics and such.Paddington sets out to find the explorer who visited his country long ago hoping to find a permanent home. What he doesnt know is that an evil taxidermist (Kidman) is out to stuff him and put him in a museum.The imaginative designs here are reminiscent of director Wes (""The Grand Budapest Hotel"") Andersons visuals and King has this wonderful way of moving from one scene to another and then back to the original exploring fantasies within fantasies.The film is loaded with back-handed social commentary -- when a young Father and Mother arrive at a hospital for Judys birth theyre ""Born to be Wild"" bikers without a care. By the time mother and daughter emerge from the hospital Father is dressed like a banker and ushers them into a beige Volvo. Relate much parents?Obviously the film follows a broad storyline -- this is for small kids -- but King and his cast adorn that storyline with so much humor and dazzle that theres never a dull moment. ""Paddington"" is a pure joy.TLongdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/toomuchTomLongPaddingtonGRADE B+Rated PG for mild action and rude humorRunning time 95 minutes""Paddington"" (PG) A talking Peruvian bear comes to London in this witty and visually imaginative kids movie adults will love.

(AP Photo/The Weinstein Company) Share PhotoPaddington Bear. How well we know him. Hes cuddly hes loyal hes sensitive. Hes well-traveled -- but loves to stay home too. And he can whip up a mean homemade marmalade.As Mom would say whats not to love?And one can say precisely the same of the engaging new ""Paddington"" written and directed by Paul King and based of course on the famous 1958 book by Michael Bond. It doesnt try to be too clever. Or too sweet. Or too dark for that matter though theres plenty of mischief thanks to Nicole Kidman channeling her inner villainess.And it works. For parents looking for a film thatll please them and their kids in equal measure ""Paddington"" is -- as Goldilocks would say in that other bear story -- just right.The ingenuity in Kings approach -- at a few points his technique even recalls Wes Anderson -- is apparent from the start. We knew that Paddington (thats not his name at first) came from ""darkest Peru"" but Kings version shows us the backstory in entertaining fashion. In the Peruvian jungle a friendly British explorer befriends a bear family and introduces them to certain veddy veddy English inventions -- like marmalade. When he leaves he tells them theyd always be welcome in London.Years later when an earthquake destroys the bears home orphaned Paddington (well thats not his name quite yet) decides to set off for London on a boat leaving his elderly aunt (Imelda Staunton) behind at a retirement home. He brings with him only a suitcase filled with jars of marmalade the hat the explorer left behind and a tag around his neck ""Please look after this bear.""Arriving in London though our bear (entirely computer generated and sensitively voiced by Ben Whishaw) finds people arent that welcoming -- its hard to even get noticed let alone immediately adopted and taken to a nice home. Luckily the Brown family alighting at Paddington Station does notice him. The rather uptight Mr. Brown (a delightful Hugh Bonneville whom most of us know from ""Downton Abbey"") isnt keen to take him in for the night but the two kids are as is their warm-hearted mum (an equally delightful Sally Hawkins.)Once at home -- just for one night Mrs. Brown promises Mr. Brown while they help find the explorer friend from long ago -- Paddington (so named after the station) proceeds to inadvertently cause a giant flood in the bathroom. This does not please Mr. Brown but will surely delight any kids in the audience -- especially when the bears head gets stuck in the toilet. Who doesnt love a good toilet flood scene?As the search for the explorer continues trouble rears its head. It seems that an evil museum taxidermist named Millicent (Kidman with short blunt-cut blonde hair and an unhinged demeanor) has designs on Paddington. She doesnt want to give him a home -- she wants to stuff him and store him in a glass case. Just why will become clear soon enough.Meanwhile all the Browns are falling for Paddington including the all-knowing housekeeper (Julie Walters). Even the stuffy old Mr. Brown -- there are clear echoes of the dad in ""Mary Poppins"" here -- comes round and becomes one of Paddingtons biggest defenders. As the showdown with Millicent reaches its climax it is Mr. Brown who will utter the films warm cuddly and very relevant message Families arent only about who youre born to. Theyre about who you love.And movies like this are easy to love too.""Paddington"" a Weinstein Company release is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""mild action and rude humor.""

Powered by WordPress.com VIP Sponsored Content Entertainment Movie Reviews 01/15/2015 1142pm Paddington Charming family film bears watching Sun-Times email By Mary Houlihan/For the Sun-Times The first must-see family film of the year comes in the shape of a small bear with a note around its neck ""Please look after this bear. Thank you."" Legions of children (and parents) will immediately know this is Paddington Bear first brought to life in Michael Bonds delightful books first published in 1958. Ten years in the making the movie version is just as delightful wrapping the viewer in an enhanced story about one very polite bear who loves marmalade and has an endless talent for getting into trouble. A mix of live action and animation (by Londons Framestore animation studio) ""Paddington"" features a roster of top British talent under Paul Kings direction that brings the story to life with a freshness not often seen in films for the younger set. The film which tackles themes of tolerance immigration and acceptance begins with a back story set in ""darkest Peru"" where Paddington (perfectly voiced by Ben Whishaw who replaced Colin Firth midway through production) lives with his Uncle Pastuzo and Aunt Lucy (voices of Michael Gambon and Imelda Staunton). Years earlier they had befriended a British explorer who helped them develop a taste for marmalade and a talent for languages. One day an earthquake destroys their elaborately clever home. It is the nudge Aunt Lucy needs to ship Paddington off to England where their explorer friend had assured them a friendly welcome would await. Bond has said the young children evacuating London during World War II with suitcases and identifying labels around their necks inspired the first Paddington book. This moment is aptly captured in the film as Paddington walks around his namesake train station looking for someone to look after him (no one blinks an eye at the sight of a young bear in their midst). Its here he eventually meets the Browns a modern yet whimsical British family led by the overly protective Mr. Brown (Hugh Bonneville) the clever and kind Mrs. Brown (a sweetly disarming Sally Hawkins) and their children sulky teen Judy (Madeleine Harris) and tween inventor Jonathan (Samuel Joslin). Uptight Mr. Brown is not keen on having the bear stay over even for one night but the big-hearted Mrs. Brown insists assuring him in the morning they will start a search for the explorer who promised that welcome many years ago. In the meantime Paddington has a very funny stranger-in-a-strange land encounter with the Browns bathroom (his use of their toothbrushes is a gross-out moment children will love) that leaves Mr. Brown certain he was correct. As they begin the search for the explorer the Paddington story veers off from the original source and the filmmakers amp up the narrative into a chase plot that involves Millicent Clyde (a vampishly fun Nicole Kidman) a taxidermist whos determined to add a certain species of brown bear to her collection. Shes assisted by the Browns nosy and randy neighbor Mr. Curry (Peter Capaldi) who is not at all pleased with having a bear next door. This transition from easygoing story to a threat on Paddingtons existence is tempered by the films even pacing and plenty of that cynical British humor. (When Mrs. Brown files a police report about a missing bear in a red hat and blue duffel coat the response is ""Its not much to go on."") Children will find plenty to love visually in ""Paddington"" a film filled with fantastic mechanical wonders. And this film simply looks fabulous with a magical set design reminiscent of a Wes Anderson movie. From the bears treetop haven and the Browns Notting Hill home (which opens up like a storybook) to an enchanting antique shop in Portobello Road the wondrous Geographic Guild and the spooky Natural History Museum this is a feast for the eyes and the imagination. The filmmakers behind ""Paddington"" successfully bring the lovable bear into the future and strike a balance between honoring the spirit of the original books and updating the story for todays young audiences. This is a charming film whose underlying message of tolerance and acceptance strikes a palpable chord in todays world -- both for children and adults. [s3r star=3.5/4] TWC-Dimension Films presents a film directed by Paul King. Written by King and Hamish McColl based on the books by Michael Bond. Running time 95 minutes.

Rated PG (mild peril innuendo). Now in theaters. If the movie version of ""Paddington"" were a nice chocolate (and it kind of is) it would be Maximum English Cocoa Overload. How English is this movie? As English as a cold rainy day at the beach. As English as the politeness that masks hostility as English as a pie that contains meat as English as secretly wishing you lived in some other country. All this makes this live-action film with a digital bear just about perfect at least as a collection of sketches without any particular direction. The genial goofiness begins in a prologue spoofing those right-jolly-good traditions of English exploring in this case in Darkest Peru where a young adventure seeker leaves a small colony of bears with English-language-instruction records and a craving for marmalade. Photo StudioCanal One young bear curious about the world (humbly voiced by Jim Whishaw) behind all of this stows away on a ship. ""Mind your manners"" his aunt tells him -- he also learns that the English have 107 different ways to say ""Its raining."" Before long he and his unpronounceable name turn up with the mail at a London train station where a curmudgeon (a highly entertaining Hugh Bonneville) his wife (Sally Hawkins) and two children agree to take him on as a temporary border and not at all a new member of the family. Oh and as for what to call him one supposes the name of the train station will do. In a sense this is an origin story for a mythic character and when Paddington finally slips on his blue duffel coat its an inspired moment like when Bruce Wayne asks of his new car ""Does it come in black?"" The screenwriters surround him with endless riffs on Anglo eccentricity such as the grandma (Julie Walters) with the lovingly maintained collection of Hoovers the mom who devises treacly nicknames (""Sweetiepops"") and the teen girl suffering from a case of nearly terminal embarrassment who nevertheless masters the art of speaking fluent Bear. Nicole Kidmas as MillicentPhoto Laurie Sparham/StudioCanal Paddington gets into some elaborate Curious George-like high jinks that arent really in the gentle sly spirit of the books (but give the film toddler appeal and cute trailer moments) and faces off with a new villain Nicole Kidman as the woman who kidnaps P. and hustles him away in a van marked ""TAXI."" At least thats how it appears when the sliding door conceals the rest of the word ""DERMIST."" Yes she wants Paddington for his pelt not his marmalade sandwiches. Such is the incessant drollery that even the evil taxidermists nutty attempts to bag Paddington at the end seem intended to be more comical than perilous but opinions of 6-year-olds may differ. Anyway a would-be scary film about the English isnt trying very hard if it contains no mention whatsoever of dentistry.

Voiced by Ben Whishaw Paddington makes new friends everywhere he goes in Paul Kings clever film. (Weinstein Co. / Dimension) Betsy Sharkey Where to start with the wondrous whimsy of Paddington? marvels L.A. Times betsysharkey Where to start with the wondrous whimsy of ""Paddington""?Artfully and cleverly the sweet spirit of that young bear from darkest Peru and his many London misadventures materializes brilliantly on screen in the very good hands of writer-director-conjurer Paul King. The beloved storybook character created by Michael Bond in the late 1950s and illustrated by Peggy Fortnum are the films touchstones the bear a creation of special effects the people around him simply special. But rather than being inhibited by the great wellspring of affection that multiple generations of kids and parents have for Paddington King seems liberated. (He was clearly just getting warmed up with the inventive but not-all-the-way-there ""Bunny and the Bull."")The filmmakers taken care to ensure all the favorite story bits are there -- the jungle the marmalade the hat the adorable English-speaking fuzzy-wuzzy turning up in London with a ""Please look after this bear"" tag around his neck. But the departures which are totally original become inspired flights of fancy. It gives the bear a formidable new villain in Millicent (Nicole Kidman in a strangely threatening white bob). She goes after the bear with an arched brow and some shiny taxidermy tools. He will make you see a fine stuffed specimen in the National History Museums rare-beasts collection which Millicent keeps ahem expanding.

The actor seems so completely overtaken by Paddington as to no longer exist. All that are left are bear and bewilderment but charmingly so. I knew after seeing Whishaw bring the lovelorn John Keats to life in ""Bright Star"" that he had the soul of a poet. It serves the often-introspective Paddington well.The visual effects add some serious magic of their own starting with Kings eccentric style. Whether umbrellas in the rain shot from above or a doll house with enchanting surprises behind its door the way the director takes and toys with images elevate the film to a sort of surrealist art. The color palette is forever evolving matching the mood of the moment and the particular person involved. From the invention to the precision the sensibility feels a close cousin to that of filmmaker Wes Andersons ""The Grand Budapest Hotel."" Of course the most important special effects are reserved for Paddington. Physically the bear functions with all the ease of the humans around him. Though the eyes do their part exceptionally expressive it is the naturalistic look when hes speaking that separates Paddington from all the comically bizarre talking CGI animals that populate movies and TV. Credit Framestores Andy Kind as visual effects and CG supervisor and Pablo Grillo as animation director for taking such care with the creature creation.Humor in all its various forms is another key ingredient. Paddington represents innocent mischief which is countered by a very dry wit. It is there from the first frame -- a black-and-white clip of an explorer explaining that his Peruvian find that does feel like a funny found object from the distant past.When the story picks up next were still in the jungle where the bear who will become Paddington now lives with Aunt Lucy (Imelda Staunton) Uncle Pastuzo (Michael Gambon) marmalade sandwiches and stories of London his command of the English language being refined by a gramophone and a record the explorer left behind. When an earthquake destroys that little bit of paradise it is clear that London is where the young bear must find his future.The underlying theme of the film as it was in Bonds stories is very much about fitting in and finding a home or at least a safe haven surrounded by those who will let you be yourself. For Paddington its the Browns the family who stumbled across him fresh off the boat and looking ever so lost at Paddington Station. They are made up of ""Downton Abbeys"" upright earl Hugh Bonneville as the prickly patriarch Henry; Sally Hawkins (Oscar-nominated for ""Blue Jasmine"") absolutely delightful as Mary his artistically inclined softhearted wife; Mrs. Bird (Julie Walters) there to keep the Browns place at 32 Windsor Garden shipshape; and not-quite-teenage Judy (Madeleine Harris) and her younger brother Jonathan (Samuel Joslin) are in the difficult process of growing up.King never forgets that the world he is building is one that Paddington is seeing for the first time. So that when a toy train starts whirring round in Mr. Grubers (Jim Broadbent) antique shop he begins to see what Mr. Grubers train ride as a child to a distant country must have looked like the train cars suddenly filling with people passing in the aisles a boy in one seat looking out the window.There is a great deal of action all of it over the top in classic slapstick style. Some are disasters tied to Paddington getting used to things like toothbrushes and bathtubs. Some involve madcap dashing about usually to escape Millicents clutches. As the bear and the Browns go from one place to another the film hits most of the major tourist sites all of them looking as if they were lifted from a storybook.Twitter betsysharkey------------PaddingtonMPAA rating PG for mild action and rude humorRunning time 1 hour 29 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Entertainment Reviews Sally Hawkins Jim Broadbent Nicole Kidman Ben Whishaw Little Accidents mines small-town tragedy with Gothic grit Kevin Hart-Josh Gad chemistry highlights The Wedding Ringer Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad76deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-paddington-review-20150116-column.html#navtype=outfit,200,paddington12,paddington,latimes

Paddington is appealingly voiced by Ben Whishaw. By NANCY CHURNIN Follow nchurnin nchurnindallasnews.com Theater Critic Published 15 January 2015 0513 PM Updated 15 January 2015 0514 PM Related From Downton Abbey to Paddington its enchantment for Hugh Bonneville From ink to film 14 books scheduled to become movies in 2015 One of the charming things about Paddington is how Paul Kings adaptation of Michael Bonds books appeals to our better instincts particularly in a time of rampant xenophobia.When an elderly bear sends her nephew away from Peru to find haven in London she puts a tag on him. Its reminiscent of the ones anxious parents put on the nearly 10000 children who left on the Kindertransport to find safety in British homes in the months before World War II began.Few recall that history in the modern London train station where a small bear appealingly voiced by Ben Whishaw clutches a suitcase rattling with jars of his favorite orange marmalade. Busy people pass. Theyre not impressed by a talking bear and they dont want to be bothered by a stranger of another species.Henry Brown performed with an authoritarian air by Downton Abbeys Hugh Bonneville tells his family to look away. But his wife Mary played tenderly off-center by Sally Hawkins is touched by the bears plight.Seeing the bear framed by the sign in the station where they find him she names him Paddington and brings him home for the night. He inadvertantly causes comic mishaps galore but like a klutzy Mary Poppins he is sensitive to the the less-than-happy Brown children Judy and Jonathan and is determined to bring the family closer.King who also directed the movie seamlessly blends the CGI Paddington with live-action characters in a world with the bright palette of a childrens book. Nicole Kidmans icy delivery and hair augmented with stiletto heels set new standards for the well-dressed villainess. When she gets her comeuppance its funny too.As for the good guys which are just about everyone else they shine in this valentine to England with lingering pans on Paddington Station and Notting Hill and pointed reminders of the good things that happen when everyone pulls together. That includes remarkable British talent willing to play small to supporting roles Imelda Staunton and Michael Gambon who voice Paddingtons aunt and uncle; Julie Walters as the housekeeper; and Jim Broadbent in a brief role as a former refugee in an antique store grateful for the welcome he received long ago.Theres a death early on thats not in the books but propels the urgency of Paddingtons determination to go to England. As everyone joins forces to save Paddington an added electricity crackles from the thought that England knows what its like to lose a beloved bear. Walt Disney Americanized Winnie the Pooh decades ago and British fans are still clamoring to reclaim the original stuffed toy from the New York Public Library. In contrast this thoroughly British take feels like victory -- sweet but with a bit of bite much like Paddingtons favorite marmalade.PADDINGTON (A-)Directed by Paul King.

The filmmakers update the vintage saga from Michael Bonds childrens books into the here-and-now but with a retro feel. Guided by producer David Heyman one of the clever lads behind the Harry Potter movies writer-director Paul King and screenwriter Hamish McColl change details from the books. Some such as the fate of Paddington Bears Uncle Pastuzo are significant. Miraculously the transformation is accomplished without losing the bears charm innocence and taste for marmalade. He also causes the same level of chaos through his mischief. That of course makes Paddington a winner for family viewing because this wonderful adventure will appeal to children and parents both for its heart and its mayhem. This is a live action movie. Like Gollum in The Lord of the Rings and Caesar in the new Planet of the Apes franchise -- but not as hyper-realistic or as threatening -- the non-human characters in Paddington were created digitally through performance capture. Animatronics are also employed for some sequences. Then the anthropomorphic bears in Paddington were given human voices along with a backstory that explains how they met a British explorer in Peru learned to speak proper and polite English and mastered the art of making marmalade. Paddington himself is voiced by Ben Whishaw (Q in the 007 movies Skyfall and Spectre). The amiable Whishaw whose voice is childlike but not juvenile replaced original choice Colin Firth when the Oscar-winner realized his kingly pipes were not appropriate. Michael Gambon and Imelda Staunton conjure the spirits of Uncle Pastuzo and Aunt Lucy. The human actors are terrific in taking the story seriously yet with a sense of the absurd. Hugh Bonneville Sally Hawkins Madeleine Harris Samuel Joslin are the Browns with Julie Walters as nanny Mrs. Bird. The support cast is just as good with Jim Broadbent and Tim Downie in key roles Peter Capaldi as meddling Reginald Curry Michael Bond in a cameo as the Kindly Gentleman Matt Lucas (from Little Britain) as a cabbie and Nicole Kidman in a sensationally sassy turn as Millicent Clyde. Millicent is the villain as wildly extravagant and dangerous as Cruella de Vil in Disneys version of The Hundred and One Dalmatians. Millicent is obsessed with getting one creature for her stuffed animal collection Paddington The horror the horror... Our hirsute hero with the jungle howl was first ""discovered"" in 1958 by Bond. A Bear Called Paddington told the story of how the cuddly creature emigrated from Peru to England and was found by the Brown family at Paddington Station. When the Browns took him home he delightfully changed their lives forever. Like that first book the movie is an origins story. Then it borrows freely from a number of Bonds stories. Director King best known in smart circles for directing The Mighty Boosh comedy troupe on TV gives Paddington a touch of the Boosh but not so much that anything gets smirky or too clever. Instead King and company take us on a romp. At the same time the sense of danger represented by Millicents intentions is meaningful and intense. So are the reasons for her obsession. So Paddington the movie has a remarkable depth and emotion to go with its antics and sly sense of humour.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Sandie Angulo Chen January 15 2015 January is when studios generally release their low-expectation titles to wither and die against award-nominated fare so its a considerable gamble to watch a film starring a CGI-talking animal released in the first weeks of the year. But this live-action ""Paddington"" adaptation pays off. Based on a half-century of classic childrens books by Michael Bond the movie is set in the present and keeps the focus in London which is depicted as the ideal place for bears and other exiles. A marmalade-loving bear cub (voiced by Ben Whishaw after Colin Firth exited the project) travels from ""Darkest Peru"" to England to find the explorer who long ago discovered the bears Aunt Lucy and Uncle Pastuzo (voiced by Imelda Staunton and Michael Gambon). Wearing only the explorers red hat the cuddly bear arrives at Londons Paddington Station where he waits all day for someone to adopt him. Finally Mrs. Brown (Sally Hawkins) overcomes the doubts of her cautious husband (Downton Abbeys Hugh Bonneville) and two kids embarrassment and takes the newly named Paddington home. Home is where the kid-friendly humor begins. In one crowd-pleasing bit of bathroom humor Paddington uses the Browns toothbrushes to pick his ears drinks a bottle of mouthwash sticks his head in the toilet and causes a massive overflow -- all while Mr. Brown desperately tries to add ""bear coverage"" to his home insurance. While the slapstick isnt particularly original director Paul King makes the silliness work. In addition to Bonneville and Hawkins the cast includes other comically adept actors such as Julie Walters (Harry Potters Molly Weasley) as the Browns live-in aunt; Peter Capaldi (the latest star of ""Doctor Who"") as their busybody neighbor; and most notably Nicole Kidman as the storys main antagonist -- a greedy museum taxidermist who wants to ""stuff"" Paddington and put him on display. Sporting animal-skin stilettos and severe bangs Kidman is campier than she is creepy but her Cruella de Vil-like character is just menacing enough to make kids fear for Paddingtons happily ever after. Because of its adorable protagonist laugh-out-loud gags and touching premise ""Paddington"" succeeds in a way most CGI/live-action hybrids do not. This isnt a commercial for bear merchandise (yet) but a sweet little film about a cub who finds a family and a home in London. Chen is a freelance writer.    PG. At area theaters. Contains mild action and rude humor. 95 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

The Weinstein Co. hide caption toggle caption The Weinstein Co. Based on the popular childrens book character Paddington follows the misadventures of a bear (voiced by Ben Whishaw) who travels to London in search of a home. The Weinstein Co. Paddington British literatures lovable anthropomorphic bear named after the train station where he was found has always been a funny sort of fellow. For nearly 60 years Michael Bonds creation has enjoyed harmless adventures with his adopted Brown family in London noshing on marmalade and allowing his good manners to point the way when his small brain cant. His endearing qualities -- politeness and a need to understand the world through trial and error -- are the sort of subtle quirks that dont always survive the transition to broad family films. Just ask Paddingtons spiritual cousins Stuart Little or The Cat in the Hat. Parts of the new live-action film Paddington look like the typical desperate overly modernized kiddie fare. Theres a large dollop of unfortunate frenetic slapstick with skateboards dogs cross-dressing and an overplayed James Brown song. But aside from the bits that practically scream ""studio-mandated"" director Paul King invokes the spirit and charm of Paddingtons personality. Even when hes getting into outsized mishaps the little bear from Darkest Peru always means well. Ben Whishaw (he was the ""new Q"" in Skyfall) voices the plucky young critter a last-minute replacement for Colin Firth who dropped out of the film mere months before its release in an amicable split. This was likely for the better. As gifted an actor as Firth is the Kings Speech star seems a bit too regal for Paddington who after all is supposed to resemble a curious clumsy child. The higher-voiced Whishaw gives the small fur ball an unforced innocence and vulnerability. Whishaw is rounded out by an excellent cast of Important Actors Being Silly including the always-effervescent Sally Hawkins as the Brown clans dotty matriarch; Downton Abbeys Hugh Bonneville as the stuffy dad who sputters safety statistics like ""Thirty-four percent of pre-breakfast accidents involve banisters""; and Jim Broadbent as the kindly antiques shop owner Mr. Gruber a fellow immigrant who shares a lovely unspoken understanding with his new bear friend. Bonds original stories didnt have much in the way of outright awful people but it takes superhuman Studio Ghibli strength for a childrens movie to come into this world without a villain. So Nicole Kidman dutifully dons an icy blond bowl cut to play Millicent a nasty museum curator who wants Paddington stuffed. Between Millicent and the utterly dull third Night At The Museum film the London Natural History Museum is having a rough time at the movies. Its a pleasant surprise that Paddington has a good deal of style and wit as in a Wes Anderson-lite sequence where the bear envisions every room of the Brown household as a dollhouse model. Later a flashback shows the Brown parents expecting their first child entering the delivery room as motorcycle-riding thrillsters but leaving as paranoid worrywarts in an SUV -- parenting distilled in one single brilliant gag. And not to get all political on this unassuming bear but its even more of a pleasant surprise that the film doesnt disguise its heros citizenship status. We see Paddington making his long and arduous journey from Darkest Peru to London as a stowaway once his aunt and uncle can no longer care for him entering the U.K. without his papers and pleading for kind benefactors by the train tracks. This isnt even a parable of immigration -- in the context of the film Paddington is a literal flesh-and-blood immigrant. Ironically its his CGI presence with that prickly fur those dark red eyes and that tiny stature that accentuates how the bear remains visually orphaned from his adopted surroundings. King and co-screenwriter Hamish McColl bring the timeliest themes of Bonds original stories to the forefront in an effective yet understated manner. When the posh urbanite family first spies the bear sitting by the tracks with little more to his name than good manners and a cardboard sign (""Please look after this bear. Thank you"") Mr. Browns first instinct is to ignore him. Its only once his family has helped demonstrate Paddingtons good nature and inherent blamelessness that hes able to care for the bear as he would his own children. Kindness wins out in the end naturally but a specific and prescient form of kindness rather than the glib one-size-fits-all brand usually seen in childrens movies. That at least deserves a marmalade sandwich.

Paddington is a family movie that really is for everyone meaning neither kids nor grown-ups will squirm with boredom. Based on a series of Michael Bond books begun in 1958 and illustrated by Peggy Fortnum the movie likewise tells the tale of a Peruvian bear in duffel coat and floppy red hat adopted by a London family. How satisfying to report that the cinematic Paddington emerges as an irresistible charmbomb that has a nice habit of sneaking up on you instead of conking you on the head. More News 2015 Preview 68 Reasons This Year Will Rule 50 Best Sci-Fi Movies of the 1970s All Stories >> Related 10 Best Movies of 2014 From a growing boy to a gone girl the top films of the year hit hardest by going rogue Credit writer-director Paul King and Harry Potter producer David Heyman for guiding this fable to the screen without the usual glossy overkill and goosed-up pyrotechnics. Paddington voiced with genuine feeling by Ben Whishaw (a substitute for the originally cast Colin Firth) is introduced living the good life in the rainforest. Then boom-squish an earthquake hits and Paddington takes a cargo ship to London where he dreams of a new beginning. Without too much fuss the bear arrives at Paddington Station and is quickly adopted -- at least temporarily -- by the Brown family blustery dad Henry (Hugh Bonneville on leave from Downton but still very lord of the Abbey) his sweet wife Mary (the pricelessly appealing Sally Hawkins) and their two scrappy moody children Judy (Madeleine Harris) and Jonathan (Samuel Joslin). After a few guttural roars the bear starts talking and in very British tones. Its funny. So is Nicole Kidman very Cruella De Vil as Millicent Clyde a taxidermist with an eye on adding Paddington to her stuffed collection. Its an excuse for some chase scenes and physical comedy (Paddington gets his head stuck in a toilet bowl) that manage to suggest both the Marx brothers and Wes Anderson. I mean that as a good thing. The human actors interact playfully with the computer-generated bear cleverly realized by the animators at Londons Framestore who worked on Gravity. The in-jokes are verbal and visual managing to reference themes as diverse as immigration and insider trading without throwing the plot off course. Paddington has no super powers though he does fly over London but he does work his way into our hearts and minds. Its all very droll and quietly memorably dazzling. ""Please Look After This Bear"" are the words written on a tag around Paddingtons neck. Smart audiences will do as instructed.

"Paddington review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review Paddington Paddington The Weinstein Company Scene from ""Paddington."" Scene from ""Paddington."" (The Weinstein Company) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune The Peru-to-London transplant gets a witty satisfying screen adaptation. Never judge by appearances. The poster image for ""Paddington"" already a hit in Britain depicts the valiant little bear in the red hat and blue jacket careening down a flooded staircase in a bathtub and the image (from the first of creator Michael Bonds 26 ""Paddington"" books) is rendered in such a way as to make the film look pushy and twee and eminently skippable.And yet the film isnt any of those things. Its witty and charming with a considerable if sneaky emotional impact. True there is a not-insignificant storytelling misjudgment in adapter/director Paul Kings picture but enough goes right here to satisfy Paddington lovers and Paddington newbies alike. Word on the movie was dicey ever since Colin Firth originally hired to do the voice of the famous bear was let go (Colin Firth Let go) in favor of the more youthful and sweeter-sounding voice provided by Ben Whishaw. The younger actor turns out to be excellent so the lesson here is Let Colin Firth go if you must. Whishaw brought a tear to my eye with his reading of a single word (""home"") arriving at a key point late in the picture. Its wonderfully in keeping with the spirit of the Bond books (the first appeared in 1958) which have led to a British TV series and an awful lot of cuddly bear merchandise.Graced with unusually delicate computer-generated animation mixed with live action ""Paddington"" retains elements of the first book ropes in bits of other books and invents a lot of its own. In ""darkest Peru"" an English explorer discovers a tribe of highly advanced and surprisingly verbal bears. An earthquake takes the life of one guardian; the surviving guardian sends off our hero to London via freighter accompanied by copious orange marmalade. Bonds stroke of genius led him to create the key image of Paddington alone on a London railway platform with a tag around his neck reading ""Please look after this bear. Thank you."" Post-World War II Britain had vivid memories of refugee after refugee of the human species on countless platforms hoping for new lives of relative safety and comfort.The film respects that inspiration. In writer-director Kings film the adoptive human family Paddington finds is played by Hugh Bonneville (Mr. Brown here a stuffy risk analyst recalling Mr. Banks of ""Mary Poppins"") Sally Hawkins (Mrs. Brown a childrens book illustrator and a complete joy) and as the Brown children Madeleine Harris and Samuel Joslin. As humans and bear learn to negotiate a life under the same roof ""Paddington"" introduces the native Peruvian to Notting Hill and thereabouts with the films fetching calypso score coloring the action. The Browns may be white bread ethnically speaking but Paddington himself delivers the thesis line dear to the multicultural ideal ""In London nobodys alike which means everyone fits in."" Latest movies reviewedOpen link Now for the misstep. ""Paddington"" invents a fearsome adversary for the bear a Cruella de Vil-brand taxidermist (Nicole Kidman) intent on killing and stuffing our pal. She has her reasons and theyre not uninteresting reasons but the movie bends into a slightly uncomfortable and off-putting shape to accommodate the antagonist. Such is the chipper goodwill of both Paddington and ""Paddington"" that you forgive the flaws. And any movie that manages to work in a dig at the National Theatres heavier pretensions -- in a subway sequence Paddington trots by a National poster for a (fake) play with the amusingly dour title ""Damned by Despair"" -- is OK with me.""Paddington"" - 3 stars MPAA rating PG (for mild action and rude humor)Running time 129Opens Fridaymjphillipstribune.comTwitter phillipstribune Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Movies Britain Reviews Colin Firth Sally Hawkins PG Rated Movies Nicole Kidman Review Blackhat Review American Sniper Review Two Days One Night Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising72deg",http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-paddington-20150115-column.html#navtype=barker&barkername=Barker%2006%20-%20In%20Case%20You%20Missed%20It,200,paddington20,paddington,chicagotribune

Photo Associated Press Paddington review Sweet tale of bear seeking home in London 1 / 2 Back to Gallery ""Please look after this bear thank you."" Those are the words on a tag tied around the neck of a small ursine creature newly arrived in London and looking for a home. They also get at the heart of ""Paddington"" a highly enjoyable film adaptation of Michael Bonds childrens book series first published in 1958. Paddington (voice of Ben Whishaw) comes to England from the Peruvian forest with great expectations about British manners and hospitality based on secondhand knowledge of an English explorer who befriended his aunt and uncle. (This backstory is conveyed in an amusing parody of an old newsreel.) But 21st century London isnt quite the bastion of civilization that Paddington dreamed about. Which is hard on him because hes a very benevolent and mannerly bear whose only vice is a fondness for marmalade. At his uncles urging he always carries a marmalade sandwich in his floppy hat which along with a duffel coat is his signature apparel. Paddington (nicely rendered in CGI) is taken in by the Brown family (which may remind more mature viewers of the Banks clan in ""Mary Poppins"") over the objections of Mr. Brown (Hugh Bonneville) a somewhat officious risk analyst. But kindhearted Mrs. Brown (Sally Hawkins) insists that they give the bear a home. Their guests first encounter with a bathroom leads to some wild slapstick and a bit of fairly tame gross-out humor which may be trying for adults but will be catnip to kids. But much of the films humor is of a gentler verbal sort. The pace accelerates with the appearance of evil Millicent (Nicole Kidman) a taxidermist at the Museum of Natural History who would just love to add a stuffed bear to the collection. As she plots to kidnap him Paddington fearing that hes alienated his hosts flees the Brown household. There are cartoonish action sequences that knowingly borrow from the likes of the ""Mission Impossible"" pictures. Will Paddington win over Mr. Brown and find a real home? My lips are sealed. Suffice it to say that this is good family fare with plenty of decent gags (visual and otherwise) and its nicely acted by all the principals. In addition Julie Walters Peter Capaldi and Jim Broadbent turn up in smaller but still lively roles. It might even boost the market for marmalade.

VPC""Paddington"" updates beloved character from childrens literature while keeping true to spirit.Oscar-nominated actress Sally Hawkins who plays Mrs. Brown and Oscar-winning actor Jim Broadbent as Mr. Gruber share a cup of tea with Paddington in the live-action adaptation.(Photo TWC-Dimension)Story Highlights3.5 stars (out of 5)Ben Whishaw voices Paddington with exceeding politeness and curiosity.The movie is packed with charm ornamented with darling details.Nicole Kidman plays a dastardly museum taxidermist intent on adding Paddington to her menagerie.It doesnt take much coaxing to be delighted by a talking bear with an insatiable craving for marmalade sandwiches. But it does take rather a lot of coaxing to accept a big-budget big-screen adaptation of a beloved but humble childrens book character especially when the little furball is all shiny and computerized.Though he doesnt emerge fully unscathed ""Paddington"" is a mostly smart update loaded with charm and it preserves enough of the fuzzy feelings for purists to walk away with a smile.The story begins at it should as anyone who grew up on Michael Bonds Paddington books will know in darkest Peru where a British adventurer discovers a family of intelligent curious bears. He teaches them English of course and about the joys of tea and marmalade. ""If you ever make it to London"" he says ""you can be sure of a very warm welcome.""The bears dubbed Lucy and Pastuzo by their English friend raise their nephew Paddington (voiced with exceeding politeness and curiosity by Ben Whishaw) in peace with genteel British etiquette until a deadly earthquake upsets their order. Lucy (who is headed adorably to the home for retired bears) decides to take the explorer up on his years-ago offer and ships Paddington off to Britain with a note pinned to his jacket ""Please look after this bear.""But 21th-century London is not nearly as hospitable as hoped. The promise of the warm welcome he was extended vanishes like a puff of smoke in the train station where Paddington sits bereft for hours until he encounters the Brown family. A no-nonsense risk analyst Mr. Brown (Hugh Bonneville channeling the bruised ego and undermined authority of Mr. Darling from ""Peter Pan"") immediately calculates the risk of bringing home a strange bear. Mrs. Brown (the always delightful Sally Hawkins) and their two children are more sympathetic though and they invite Paddington to spend the night until he can find more appropriate accommodations.Hugh Bonneville stars as Mr. Brown who reluctantly takes in talking bear Paddington. (Photo The Weinstein Company)""Paddington"" is packed with charm ornamented with darling details (for instance the marmalade-obsessed bear calls pockets ""sandwich compartments"") and the thoughtfully designed Brown home pops with color and feels like a dollhouse -- the perfect staging ground for Paddingtons cuddly chaos and domestic mayhem. All that care sustains the storybook quality despite Paddingtons sojourn into modernity.Where it stumbles is in trying to up the stakes and the kinetic frenzy with the introduction of a sinister plot. The rare bear draws the attention of Millicent (Nicole Kidman) a dastardly museum taxidermist intent on adding Paddington to her menagerie. Shes an uninspired villain who feels airlifted from a ""Mission Impossible"" knockoff -- a very discordant tone to pair with old-school British storybook charm.Ultimately though ""Paddington"" is a good compromise between that nostalgic charm and the demands of mainstream family-friendly filmmaking. It may stumble in the updating but the spirit of the thing remains intact. This bear was well looked after.

Despite some lazy plotting Paddington -- based on the series of books written by Michael Bond starting in 1958 -- is sure to appeal to younger audiences and thanks to a modestly cheeky sense of humour may even give adults reason to smile.Article Continued BelowThe story opens in the jungles of ""darkest Peru"" with a faux newsreel of the type commonly shown in movie theatres many decades ago depicting the adventures of a British explorer Montgomery Clyde and his encounters with a family of talking bears who live in a house that resembles a giant beehive.Paddington voiced by Ben Whishaw enjoys the sites of London including Buckingham Palace in the film based on the beloved childrens book series.Some years later an earthquake destroys the world around the bears so Aunt Lucy encourages the as-yet-unnamed Paddington to head off to London where Clyde has assured a warm welcome will be waiting.The young bear with his Uncle Pastuzos floppy hat and a suitcase filled with marmalade finds himself at Paddington Station where he is eventually -- albeit reluctantly -- brought home by Mr. Brown along with his wife and kids Judy and Jonathan.Naturally fish-out-of-water adventures ensue for the bear-out-of-jungle who soon becomes the prey for a crazed natural museum employee and avid taxidermist named Millicent (Nicole Kidman).The best part about the film is the bear itself an inspired blend of CGI courtesy of the U.K.s Framestore and animatronics from master designer Nick Dudman.Voiced by Ben Whishaw Paddington is delightful and endearing even when he must occasionally reproach someone for a breach of good manners.Relative neophyte director Paul King has drawn on the deep bench strength of the British thespian ranks casting Downton Abbeys Earl of Grantham Hugh Bonneville as the statistics-spouting risk analyst Mr. Brown -- ""34 per cent of pre-breakfast accidents involve banisters"" -- the effervescent Sally Hawkins as Mrs. Brown and Julie Walters as scrappy housekeeper Mrs. Smith.Theres also Jim Broadbent as genial Mr. Gruber Little Britains Matt Lucas as a hilariously chatty cabbie as well as Imelda Staunton voicing Aunt Lucy and Michael Gambon voicing Uncle Pastuzo.But a couple of annoying lapses will grate with attentive adults. The first involves a flooded bathroom scene that should have wrought utter destruction on the Brown family abode. But by the next day things have magically returned to normal.The second why does the pre-London Paddington only have a name in unpronounceable ""bear"" language even though his aunt and uncle have human ones?Then theres Kidman as the ostensible villainess a part she would have made much more fun (and interesting) if shed extended herself beyond the ice princess caricature.But these are minor issues unlikely to trouble young audiences who are likely to emerge from the theatre with big grins and an unaccountable craving for marmalade.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Looking battered chewed and hugged too tight by generations of slobbering tots the beloved star of more than 35 million British childrens books since he made his first appearance in 1958 now waddles onto the big screen ready to enchant the children of the grownup children who once made him the pride of the nursery. Paddington Bear emerges unscathed and ready for more. Affectionately written and directed by Paul King Paddington is a harmless delight that blends live action with animated technology in the manner of Ted but without the raunch. The misadventures begin with black and white newsreel footage of a British explorer visiting the wilds of Peru where he is befriended by a family of gentle bears to whom he introduces the magic and joy of marmalade. Leaving behind his hat and the promise to return their hospitality if they ever get to London he returns home. Years later having morphed into wide screen and Technicolor little Paddington (voiced by sweet-sounding Ben Whishaw) his Uncle Pastuzo and Aunt Lucy (voiced by U.K. veterans Michael Gambon and Imelda Staunton) are hit by a tragic storm that leaves only little Paddington to face an uncertain future. Before she packs off to the retirement home for aging bears on assisted living Aunt Lucy sends her orphaned nephew across the sea to London with a small valise a box of her homemade orange marmalade and a note around his neck that says ""Please look after this bear--Thank You"" What follows are a series of rough and tumble encounters with life in London guaranteed to charm and delight children from 5 to 55 that raises family fare to a new level of entertainment value. PADDINGTON  (3/4 stars) Written and directed by Paul King Starring Hugh Bonneville Sally Hawkins and Julie Walters Running time 95 min. Less welcoming than he was promised London is one gigantic culture clash that treats Paddington like an accident waiting to happen. Cheerful confused and clumsy the little bear gets lost before he even gets out of Paddington station where he is rescued and named after the spot where he was found by the nice Brown family--endearingly played by Hugh Bonneville Sally Hawkins and their two children Madeleine Harris and Samuel Joslin. Its captivating to watch Paddington grapple with his first English bathtub battle the cold and clammy English weather with a Mary Poppins umbrella and attract a mob of police by innocently returning a wallet to a man who turns out to be a notorious pickpocket. Paddington mixes enchanting toffee box sets with actual London locations while Paddington himself mixes with live people pets and obstacles such as skateboards double-decker buses TV antennas subways and the bustling crowds in Trafalgar Square. Nobody thinks theres anything odd about a teddy bear three feet tall in a red explorers hat and green Loden coat with wooden buttons who speaks perfect English. ""In London"" says Mrs. Brown ""everyone is different--so anyone can fit in."" This philosophy clear-eyed and anxiety-free dominates the movie and remains unshaken from start to finish. Of course 85 minutes is too long to sustain nothing beyond a series of comic pratfalls. Enter the villain an evil taxidermist named Millicent from Britains Natural History Museum in the curvaceously toxic body of Nicole Kidman deviously hatching plots to trap and ensnare this perfect specimen from the talking bear kingdom and lure Paddington into her dissection laboratory for her own evil purposes with the Browns and their tipsy housekeeper Mrs. Bird (a deliciously eccentric Julie Walters) in hot pursuit to save him. In a feisty change of pace from her usual dramatic roles Ms. Kidman sneers and creeps through the rainy alleys of London overacting all over the place like Meryl Streep in Into the Woods. She seems to have a fine time of it with a not-so-subtle nod to Cruella de Vil. For some grownups the feel-good kindergarten whimsy will wear out early but theres always the marvel of watching a great cast prance through sectional open-up sets like mechanical Hallmark cards. There are worse things to do in life than take your favorite child leave cynicism behind and surrender to the considerable charm of Paddington.

Paddington voiced by Ben Whishaw gets his sweet due in the film.(Photo Studio Canal/The Weinstein Company)The marmalade-loving bear from ""darkest Peru"" takes a charming cinematic adventure in the whimsical Paddington.Based on the beloved childrens books by Michael Bond Paddingtons journey from South America to London is just droll enough for adults -- qualifying as a gentle parable about xenophobia -- and exuberant enough for the youngest viewers ( out four; rated PG; opens Friday nationwide).Orphaned Paddington (sweetly voiced by Ben Whishaw) is forced to leave the jungle home he shares with his Aunt Lucy due to an ecological disaster. (His aunt goes to live in the Home for Retired Bears in Lima.)Years ago his parents had met a friendly explorer who assured them of a warm welcome if they were to venture to England. Ever so jaunty in his floppy red hat the little CGI-created critter lands in London and is promptly ignored by the hordes of commuters at Paddington Station. Perhaps because theyve already seen some odd goings-on between platforms 9 and 10 everyones unfazed by a furry little bear cub walking upright. (Appropriately Harry Potter producer David Heyman helmed this project along with director Paul King).The plucky ursine furball is finally befriended by the Brown family or specifically by the free-spirited Mrs. Brown (Sally Hawkins) who names him after the train station. Her uptight husbandMr. Brown (Hugh Bonneville) an insurance risk analyst wants little to do with a walking talking teddy bear. Even their children Jonathan (Samuel Joslin) and Judy (Madeleine Harris) seem less than impressed. Eventually however the entire Brown family becomes dedicated to the good-natured bear. Whats not to love?That everyone -- from passersby to nosy neighbor Mr. Curry (Peter Capaldi) and villainous taxidermist Millicent (Nicole Kidman) -- takes the notion of a talking bear in stride is part of the silly fun. (Curry fusses that a Peruvian bear will fill their quiet neighborhood with ""jungle music and all-night picnics."")Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare A young bear named Paddington makes his way to England in search of a new home the family that takes him in begins to treat him as one of their own. VPCAn old-fashioned sensibility (the book series began in the 1950s) amid a modern setting juxtaposes cleverly here. Blessedly free of snark and cynicism the film indulges in some mild gross-out humor but its fairly benign. And Paddington is always kind and exceedingly polite -- a lovely role model for young audience members.Bear-out-of-habitat segments are amusing sometimes delving into slapstick with a flooded bathroom scenario and mayhem in a transit station.Whishaw Hawkins and Downton Abbeys Bonneville strike just the right notes. Imaginative production design which occasionally brings to mind Wes Andersons Moonrise Kingdom adds to the storys appeal.Whats new is a dastardly scheme to capture and stuff Paddington.Given the tame nature of the Paddington booksIts odd that its taken so long for such a popular storybook character to get his own movie. Hes starred in several TV series and his books have sold 35 million copies. The stuffed bears are a favorite toy especially at Christmas. Given the holiday tie-in and the family-friendly subject its baffling why the film didnt open in November or December.But Paddington is in theaters now and delightfully captures the books winsome style heart and distinctly British spirit. 30 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1IKKk7j",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/01/14/paddington-review/21733585/,200,paddington25,paddington,usatoday

The storybook bears tale remains largely intact After enduring hardship in Peru our red-bowler-topped hero stows away to London where he is taken in by the Browns (led by Hugh Bonneville and Sally Hawkins). He soon bumbles comically through the trappings of everyday human life such as bathroom fixtures rolls of Scotch tape and hall banisters. But his biggest nemesis and the biggest departure from the book series is a ruthless museum taxidermist with a Louise Brooks do (Nicole Kidman having a ball) who would like nothing more than to stuff him to the gills--and not with fruit-preserve sandwiches. Paddington is fast-paced yet unhurried serving up surprisingly subtle ideas on melting-pot urban diversity--Paddington is a stranger in a strange land after all--and rich visual tableaux including a gorgeous recurring shot of the Brown home as a living dollhouse. For BBC fans there may not be enough of a spotlight on its ace cast (current Doctor Who Time Lord Peter Capaldi gets only a handful of scenes as crusty neighbor Mr. Curry) but in honoring a beloved child-lit figure writer-director Paul King has taken to heart the instructions hanging from Paddingtons neck ""Please look after this bear. Thank you."" Mission accomplished.

After all so many charming childrens storybooks have had the delight squeezed out of them after being elongated into a three-act structure on the way to the big screen. (Remembering the ""Cat in the Hat"" movie still brings on an involuntary shudder.) See Video Paddingtons Ben Whishaw Arrives in London Evades Nicole Kidman in New Trailer (Video) Luckily ""Paddington"" has proven to be as tireless as its lead character making the transition with genuine wit and emotion. There are plenty of laughs -- and nothing that goes over a kids head to an adult funny bone is smutty or smarmy -- and the sentiment never feels strained or artificial. I wont deny getting a little choked up when they give the bear his famous blue duffle coat in a moment of familial love. We meet our titular hero (voiced by Ben Whishaw ""Skyfall"") in ""darkest Peru"" where years earlier a British explorer befriended the bears aunt and uncle Lucy (Imelda Staunton) and Pastuzo (Michael Gambon) introducing them to such English pleasures as teatime and orange marmalade. Upon his departure the explorer told Lucy and Pastuzo that theyd be welcome in London and so when their forest home is destroyed Lucy sends Paddington off on an ocean voyage armed only with the explorers hat a suitcase full of marmalade and a tag that says ""Please look after this bear. Thank you."" Also Read Paddington Banks on US Kids Buying Into Beloved British Bear He makes it as far as Londons Paddington train station and hes prepared to settle in for the night when hes invited home by the kindly Mrs. Brown (Sally Hawkins) over the objections of the obsessively safety-minded Mr. Brown (Hugh Bonneville). They name him ""Paddington"" and set out to help him find the explorer even after the bear nearly and quite inadvertently destroys their home. (The trailers would have you believe that the film is wall-to-wall slapstick mayhem but writer-director Paul King adapting Michael Bonds beloved book series doesnt go overboard on our heros mishaps in the human world.) As Paddington finds himself growing closer to the Browns and their two young children he becomes the target of Museum of Natural History taxidermist Millicent (Nicole Kidman in ""The Golden Compass"" blonde ice-queen mode) who has her own reasons for wanting to stuff and mount Paddington. It should be noted that one of the films greatest achievements is working in a genuinely threatening villain plus passing references to the Blitz (Paddingtons tag) and even the Kindertransport (Jim Broadbents antiques dealer recalls being a young refugee) without ever losing its tone of childlike whimsy. Also Read Pharrell Williams Gwen Stefani Team Up For Paddington Original Song Shine King a veteran of the oddball comedy series ""The Mighty Boosh"" keeps the laughs coming from clever wordplay (the side of Kidmans van reads ""TAXI"" until she slides the door shut to reveal ""DERMIST"") to absurd visual sight gags without ever losing touch with the characters all four members of the Brown family have their individual quirks and strengths and we get to see how Paddington insinuates his way into all their lives for the better. It certainly helps that the film boasts such a great cast of comic heavyweights including Matt Lucas Peter Capaldi (""Doctor Who"") and Julie Walters. ""Paddington"" manages to be such a sweetly funny concoction that you might find yourself hungering for further big-screen adventures. And maybe a spot of orange marmalade.

Look at her works. But Ralph Waldo never lived to see committee-crafted kiddo flicks especially those of the CG era. Laid open a movie like Rio 2 or Planes Fire amp; Rescue reveals not so much the mind of its creators but what its creators think of the minds of their audience that the children of America (and the world) are crass and easily distractible dullards and not worth taking seriously as like people. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Not so with Paddington Paul Kings live adaptation of Michael Bond and Peggy Fortnums warmhearted (and thoroughly un-crass) bear-in-the-city illustrated chapter books. The director and writers and producers and cast seem to believe that kids arent monsters -- and that 50-year-old childrens lit is only a little bit fusty.The films not quite the quiet hug of the books where visiting the theater or an auction house is plot enough but its far from the noisome Penguins of Madagascar experience. A smartly bobbed Nicole Kidman plays a Cruella de Vil-type villain eager to stuff Paddington for the British Museum and theres a couple of chases and home-destroying comic set pieces the best of which involves a torrent of bathwater and suggests both the stateroom scene from A Night at the Opera and the blood elevators from The Shining.Film DetailsCritics Pick Paddington RatingPG GenreAnimation Running Time95 min. More Info Trailer Yes the idea of Paddington parasailing through London in accidental chase after a pickpocket wouldnt be out of place in Kevin Jamess Zookeeper but the joyous grace of the finished scene has few analogues in multiplexes. The sequence isnt busy garish and clanging like the clever but endless fracases of the Toy Storys and the filmmakers actually bother to summon some wonder when Paddington takes improbable flight. The bear an orphan from ""darkest Peru"" finds his new city marvelous and his soaring over it is a chance to relish its beauty.The scale of the occasional mayhem is heightened but its spirit and ingenuity doesnt feel wholly at odds with the books either Theres just enough Hollywood hurly-burly to make this qualify as a 2015 release for kids -- and just enough last-century picture-book gentleness to make it feel separate from our time.Whats most edifying here is all the live-action playfulness a witty script precisely mad performances production design thats part Wes Anderson dollhouse part old-London crampedness and part educational toy store. Director Kings cast is appealingly dotty especially Sally Hawkins and Hugh Bonneville as a mom and dad who take in the bear they discover stranded at Paddington Station. The father is a safety-minded actuary who spouts statistics that are just plain crackers ""Thirty-four percent of pre-breakfast accidents involve banisters"" Moms a ragamuffin illustrator endowed with eyes as wide and arresting as any computer-generated critters. Better still the smile thats always just unloosening itself irrepressible proof of all the batty good humor her husband pretends not to relish. Kidmans also a crackpot pleasure giving poisonous bite to Kings best lines like the there-goes-the-neighborhood speech where she insists the new bear in town is just the first of a migrant horde that will corrupt the great city with ""raucous all-night picnics."" (And her clothes from costume designer Lindy Hemming are divine Think Teddy Roosevelt as an SS Girl Scout.)The kids are funny too as are the quirks of their characters. The daughter has a rare command of languages and she teachers herself to growl like a bear but thats not as amusing as the Chinese for Business Travelers tapes we overhear ""I have been accused of insider trading and require legal representation."" The boy meanwhile is subordinate in a way Ive never seen in a family-takes-in-an-impossible-creature story -- the movie never becomes about his special bond with the bear. Likewise the parents here are never the usual killjoys who must be lied to. Instead theyre the goofiest of all instigating the adventure rather than shutting it down.The movie employs real actors and a CG bear. Paddington himself voiced by Ben Whishaw is fine but hes also the movies chief failing. He never comes fully alive as a character. Hes a bear who wants a home -- and finds one in nothing flat. He inadvertently causes minor disasters but hes immediately forgiven -- sometimes even celebrated. Occasionally a shot aping Fortnums original drawings will stir some feeling. Theres some power in seeing Paddington sitting before an attic window gazing out at the city wishing he werent alone -- but there would be even more if we ever suspected he were alone. Hes loved pretty much from the get-go but even thats somewhat refreshing. Heres a kids movie mostly stripped of manufactured go-nowhere plot crisesWritten and directed by Paul King. Based on the books by Michael Bond. Starring Sally Hawkins Hugh Bonneville Nicole Kidman Ben Whishaw Madeleine Harris Samuel Joslin Julie Walters Peter Capaldi and Jim Broadbent.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet In a bid for this years Lord-Miller Prize writer-director Paul King (The Mighty Boosh) stuffs Paddington--his 90s-style mostly live-action adaptation of Michael Bonds childrens book series--with gags visual puns and imaginative framing devices all the while preserving a sense of easygoing sweetness. A dollhouse transforms into a cutaway set; a tree mural blooms with flowers or loses its leaves depending on a familys mood; a chase involving the titular ursid syncs up with a GPS instruction to ""bear left"" and a classroom studying The Winters Tale. All the while an omniscient calypso band provides commentary in song often huddled under awnings to protect their instruments from the London rain. There are Rube Goldberg slapstick sequences (co-writer Hamish McColl has written a couple of Rowan Atkinson movies and it shows) and jokes about everything from Tube signs to taxis. Its visually busy but not frenzied and if the film seems head-and-shoulders above the average effects-driven family-matinee flick its because it never gives the impression that its trying to be anything more (or less) than good-natured and fun to watch.King and McColl have tweaked Bonds stories about a marmalade-loving duffle-coat-wearing bear into a baby-mild satire of xenophobia and anti-immigrant rhetoric. Having learned English from a set of decades-old records (""Fact Londoners have 107 ways of saying its raining."") and mastered the manners and disapproving stare of the stereotypical mid-century Englishman Paddington (voiced by Ben Whishaw) travels from Darkest Peru to London where nobody seems to care that hes an anthropomorphic talking bear but plenty of people seem to be hung up on the fact that hes an immigrant. Taken by the Browns (Hugh Bonneville and Sally Hawkins) to their home at 32 Windsor Gardens Paddington is met with suspicion by next-door neighbor Mr. Curry (Peter Capaldi) who worries that the arrival of a Peruvian bear will bring ""jungle music"" and ""all-night picnics"" to their quiet street. Its hardly a subversion of the original stories; heck Michael Bond himself pops up to offer an approving toast to the proceedings. However as with a lot of art thats meant for children--which is what Paddington is regardless of its sophistication or the resumes of all involved--the point is to explain a value rather than take it apart. Despite the presence of a high-tech taxidermist villain (Nicole Kidman in a bleached bob) and the movies repeated references to World War II-era evacuations (including the least tasteless Holocaust reference to ever grace a talking animal movie) what Paddington presents is an essentially sweet-tempered vision of urban life founded on shared values of decency; even the movies ribbing of casual big-city bigotry is gentle.

By Anthony Lane Julianne Moore stars in a movie directed by Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland.   Credit Illustration by Simon Prades The life that is led by Alice Howland (Julianne Moore) appears to be perfect although its not a perfection that everyone would crave. She is gracious beautiful and fifty years old with three equally beautiful children Anna (Kate Bosworth) Tom (Hunter Parrish) and Lydia (Kristen Stewart). Alice is a professor of linguistics at Columbia and the author of ""From Neurons to Nouns."" She dresses well eats well and cooks a flawless Christmas dinner. She is married to John (Alec Baldwin) a senior research physician who adores her. They have an apartment on the Upper West Side and a house at the beach. What could possibly go wrong? The answer is ""everything"" as Alice would realize if she had read Sophocles in college. Or more recently if she had grabbed a coffee with the heroine of Woody Allens ""Blue Jasmine"" who was also married to Alec Baldwin. Look what happened to her. The mantrap that ensnares Alice however is not poverty or adultery but Alzheimers disease which snaps into her without mercy. She goes from minor patches of forgetfulness such as any of us might experience to near-wipeout. Her kind of Alzheimers is rare as though the Fates had decided for a laugh to butcher the exclusive high-achieving joy of her existence with a no less specialized brand of disease. In the words of her doctor ""With familial early-onset things can go fast. And actually with people who have a high level of education things can go faster."" In Alices case ""familial"" means first that she probably inherited Alzheimers from her father who died of alcoholism and second that her children have a fifty-per-cent chance of carrying the mutated gene. All of them should they want their futures told will have to be tested. This is one hell of a burden for them and it places hefty dramatic demands on the writers and directors of ""Still Alice"" Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland who adapted the novel by Lisa Genova. How can they dole out the perplexity as it descends on each child? Well they dont. The results of the tests are reported in a quick phone call and thats that a loss of nerve that tells you much about the movie as a whole. Time and again as it comes to the next stage of deterioration or distress it flinches. Try laying it beside Michael Hanekes ""Amour"" which shows the effect of a stroke on an elderly woman no less refined than Alice and on her loved ones. Haneke knows the worst and considers it his duty to show it; Glatzer and Westmoreland want us to know just enough and no more. For many viewers thatll do fine. Once theyve seen Alice wet her pants because she cant remember where the bathroom is no more details are required. Why push things any further? ""Still Alice"" remains as polite as informed and as cautiously compassionate as the society that it depicts. It makes sure from the start that we grasp the irony of Alices plight. Lecturing on ""the relationship between memory and computation that is the very essence of communication"" she forgets a word. Later speaking to health professionals and fellow-sufferers she summons the courage to get through her speech and is applauded at the end--though not by her husband who is away on business. You can feel Baldwin itching to make his character not merely square and industrious but troublesome and even cruel; the rest of the film though doesnt want to go there. It prefers the softening touch a score by Ilan Eshkeri that urges mourning upon us with slow-paced piano and strings; a reading by Lydia from ""Angels in America"" about ascending souls; and even clips of old home movies from a grainy past that is now being swept away. That was a pretty cheap trick when it was used in ""Philadelphia"" and its no less manipulative--and effective--more than twenty years on. Despite all that and in the absence of the anger and the wildness that are crouched and caged within this most terrible of themes ""Still Alice"" is worth watching for the sake of Julianne Moore. She has always compounded sweetness with steel and both are brandished here. The smile that Alice gives as her utterance falters is more heartbreaking for being so radiant; we understand at once what it will cost this particular woman to put on a good show and a happy face. At the other extreme is the message that when still compos mentis she leaves for herself--or for a later version of that self--on her laptop issuing instructions for suicide. The tone of practical plainness is wonderfully caught. ""Hi Alice I am you"" she begins. To be and not to be at the same time that is the question that Moore would if unleashed have pursued to its tragic limit. ""Still Alice"" gives her only half a chance. It has taken a while for Paddington Bear to arrive on the big screen. Michael Bonds ""A Bear Called Paddington"" was published in 1958. Sales of that book and its sequels run to more than thirty-five million copies and the hero has assumed many forms the largest being the bulbous inflatable--complete with his trademark duffel coat and floppy hat--that has drifted along in the Macys Thanksgiving Day Parade. Enormity though does Paddington no favors; smallness of stature is intrinsic to his appeal. In the new film which is entitled simply ""Paddington"" he is described as being around three feet six. Its ideal viewers will be of similar height. The movie is true to the characters essence as distilled by Bond Paddington armed with little more than impeccable manners and marmalade is dispatched by his Aunt Lucy from ""Darkest Peru"" to London where he is taken in by the Browns. In the stories Peru stays utterly unknown and our first indication that the film will beat a fresh path comes as it reveals flickering black-and-white footage of a British expedition to the Peruvian rain forest during which an explorer befriends some resident bears. They are left with the firm belief that London is a place to dream about trust in and visit. The scene is set. As a rule too much backstory is dead weight but ""Paddington"" proves a surprising exception. The writer and director Paul King scatters the tale with handfuls of eccentric charm first in the forest and then in the home of the Browns. At one point borrowing freely from Wes Anderson he frames it as a living dolls house with each member of the family hard at work or play in a different room. There is Mr. Brown (Hugh Bonneville) a risk analyst by trade and therefore allergic to shenanigans; Mrs. Brown (Sally Hawkins) tenderhearted and brightly clad; the glum Judy (Madeleine Harris) and her brother Jonathan (Samuel Joslin); and the housekeeper Mrs. Bird (Julie Walters) who complains of feeble knees. There is a definite dash of ""Mary Poppins"" in this setup the idea being that the father fussing and frustrated should have the starch wrung out of him by the advent of a kindly outsider. Families are a puzzle and it is the job of a Paddington or a Mary to solve them. As for plot Bond managed to do without one stringing up episodes like handkerchiefs on a clothesline. That looseness was preserved on British TV where a puppet Paddington ambled hither and thither in stop-motion. (The narrator was Michael Hordern whose wise and tolerant tones were also used for the voice-over of ""Barry Lyndon."") King needs something tougher and that means Nicole Kidman. She plays an evil taxidermist bent on stealing and stuffing this rare Peruvian species (""Ursa marmalada"" we learn) though by the look of her--the helmet of blond hair and the tightly buttoned outfits--I reckon that what she really wants is to tie him up and get all grizzly on him whispering ""Keep the red hat on"" into his little ears. Such villainy feels out of whack with the Paddington myth which is remarkable for its lack of threat. Bond admitted that the Brown household reflected ""the rather safer prewar world which I remember from my childhood"" and the movie doesnt shy from that nostalgia. Mrs. Brown suggests consulting an encyclopedia instead of going online and the bulk of the wizardry is mechanical crammed with things that swivel shunt and lock. Meanwhile we barely notice that Paddington himself bright-eyed and bushy-pelted is so modern as to be nonexistent forged from C.G.I. Even more up-to-date is the political timbre a calculated move I suspect in a year when both British and American elections will be fraught with talk of immigration. ""Please Look After This Bear"" reads a tag around Paddingtons neck and it is to that basic plea rather than to the alert of ""stranger danger"" which is Mr. Browns initial reaction that the movie accedes reminding us--somewhat naggingly--of the heros status as a refugee. Will children however flock to the film because it tells them how they should vote if they could? Or because they like the bit where Paddington gets his head stuck in a toilet? Wait and see.

The original stories marmalade-flavored quintessentially British tone of voice and the ursine orphans episodic adventures dont seem immediately feature-friendly given the tales lack of superpowers princesses or stuff blowing up. Perhaps thats one reason that the marketing campaign for the new Paddington film produced by Heyday Films (which created the Harry Potter franchise) got off to such an inauspicious start with the first trailer in June 2014. The clip quickly spawned Internet memes about the CGI bears supposed ""creepiness"" and much concern from British fans and Anglophiles abroad that the finished product was ""in a mess"" to borrow a Bondian description especially when news broke that Colin Firth had stepped away from the microphone and been replaced by Ben Whishaw as the voice of Paddington. To top it all theres been an uproar in the British press this week because the film which opens on Nov. 28 in the U.K. (and Jan. 16 in the U.S.) will have a PG rating instead of the expected U (the U.K. equivalent of a G). Crikey many thought what have they done to Paddington? Its a relief to report that the final film is actually quite charming thoughtful and as cuddly as a plush toy albeit one with a few modern gizmos thrown in. These include a contemporary (if decidedly retro) period setting an extended narrative arc featuring an invented baddie (Nicole Kidman) to add tension a right-on subtextual message about tolerance and some winking jokes and allusions only grown-ups will get like references to Wes Anderson films. All in all it strikes a judicious balance between honoring the spirit of the original books and servicing the needs of the target demographic. Plus theres a scene where Paddington puts his head in a toilet and floods the bathroom. Whats not to like? Inevitably the opening stretch gussies up Paddingtons backstory considerably. Where the original book was content to merely tell the reader that our hero was a stowaway on a boat from ""Darkest Peru"" raised by an aunt now in a home for retired bears the film shows us this and more. First a mock newsreel unfolds telling how Paddingtons Aunt Lucy and Uncle Pastuzo (voiced by Imelda Staunton and Michael Gambon respectively) met a mysterious British explorer who introduced them cargo-cult-style to the wonder that is marmalade and also helpfully left behind a gramophone that taught them English with a received-pronunciation accent. But years later by which time their young orphaned and notably disaster-prone nephew has come to live with Lucy and Pastuzo the latter is tragically killed in an earthquake and this sets the young bear on his way to London. But at Paddington Station he finds the locals less welcoming than hed expected. (Nevertheless the film is basically one big love letter to the city and much of it was shot on location.) Kind-hearted Mrs. Brown (Sally Hawkins Happy-Go-Lucky Blue Jasmine) a childrens book illustrator takes a shine to the little bear whom she names after the station. She manages to persuade her stiff-backed insurance-assessor husband Mr. Brown (Hugh Bonneville Downton Abbey) and kids -- sulky teen Judy (Madeleine Harris) and tween geek Jonathan (Samuel Joslin) -- to let Paddington move in with them and their elderly relative Mrs. Bird (Julie Walters) until he finds somewhere more suitable to stay. The aforementioned plumbing-related disaster soon occurs followed swiftly by mishaps on a subway escalator an elaborate chase through Notting Hill involving a skateboard and a double-decker bus and assorted other hijinks that will tickle younger viewers pink. Meanwhile a taxidermist (Kidman) gets wind of Paddingtons presence in the city and determines to acquire him for the collection at the Natural History Museum. To this end she recruits help from the Browns grumpy but randy neighbor Mr. Curry (Peter Capaldi Dr. Who). The two storylines come together satisfyingly for the finale prompting the requisite neatly packaged message about makeshift families and love conquering all but done with an admirably light touch. Indeed the great achievement of writer-director Paul King who comes more from a TV comedy (The Mighty Boosh) and pop video background and has made only one feature (Bunny and the Bull a semi-animated curio) is his ability to work with a broad palette here in both emotional and technical terms. In between all the knockabout physical humor theres a palpable sense of sadness and loss and a running theme about displacement that evokes variously the evacuation of Jewish children from Germany during World War II the Afro-Caribbean people who came to Britain in the 1950s and 60s and contemporary immigrants whose presence is a hot-button political issue at the moment. One clever if not terribly original device for example has some of the music performed by a five-piece calypso band that at first sounds like its part of a non-source soundtrack only for the camera to reveal they are itinerant buskers within the scene itself. A similar playfulness runs through the movie. A dollhouse in the attic opens up to reveal all the residents of the Brown household moving from room to room in a way that directly quotes as does the musician device any number of Wes Anderson movies although The Royal Tenenbaums is probably the most resonant reference. Elsewhere an invisible cut shows the seemingly instantaneous transformation of Mr. Brown from a freewheeling motorcycle-riding rebel into a Volvo-driving dad on the day his first child is born. The production design by Gary Williamson and costume design by Lindy Hemming similarly straddle the gray area between realism and luridly colored exaggeration. Performances across the board sing in the same key with everyone a bit hyped up and overacting just enough to make it fun. Hawkins whose casting is inspired here stands out especially and brings a particular poignancy to the party while Bonneville shows off a comic side he hasnt been allowed to indulge enough. The ""acting"" from Paddington himself or rather the CGI animators at Londons Framestore is subtle and expressive although some of the fur movement is a little computer-y. Whishaws gentle tenor voice has such a touching fragility to it that one wonders how they ever thought anyone else could have done it better.

But not too cuddly. The beauty of this winning film from Harry Potter producer David Heyman and writer-director Paul King (The Mighty Boosh) is that its charmingly simple. But it also offers a sharp modern spin on Michael Bonds London-set stories without being cynical. For kids its fun fast and sweet. For adults its a parable of immigration the story of a big-eyed outsider having his hopeful dreams challenged by the realities of the British capital. Fantasy? What fantasy? The basics are the same a small bear with a Marmalade habit is found at Paddington station and adopted by the nice middle-class Browns; hairy chaos and family bonding ensues. But the framing is new. Theres an Up-style preamble in Peru sad and funny that deals with Paddingtons aspirations to be British They will not have forgotten how to treat a stranger. The early mishaps when hes taken in by Mr and Mrs Brown (Hugh Bonneville Sally Hawkins both excellent) and their kids are straight out of Bonds books - an overflowing bath slapstick on the Tube. But the danger later on is all-new as evil taxidermist Millicent (Nicole Kidman devilish) concocts a plan to stuff the bear. This high drama rubs a little awkwardly against the earlier knockabout larks. But seeing as Bond filled several books with tales that can be summed up as Paddington tries to make toffee or Paddington plays cricket its hard to criticise the plot for taking a turn towards the multiplex. Also straight out of the books is grumpy neighbour Mr Curry (Peter Capaldi) but here hes a Little Englander clearly racist and worrying about the bears jungle music. Mr Brown starts out small-minded too sniffing at Paddingtons sob story and encouraging his family to ignore the bear on the railway platform as hes probably selling something. The film is a quiet two-claws-up to xenophobia on behalf of our Peruvian friend. Visually its as if the ultra lo-fi look of the 1970s TV version has been given a once-over by Wes Anderson and then given a polish by a more populist director. Theres also a welcome sense of timelessness its set now (we see The Shard) and yet no one uses mobiles or the internet. The bear himself survives his CG makeover; hes cute and a little ragged (and beautifully voiced by Ben Whishaw). In bringing this much-loved creature to life Paddington oozes care as if King and Heyman have made the label around the animals neck their guiding motto Please look after this bear thank you. If thats the case its job done. What a relief.

The start is uncomfortable to watch and I imagine resonates a little too loudly with people visiting London for the first time but luckily it cheers up from there onwards. The special effects are so good you forget at times that paddington isnt actually a super talented talking bear. This is a gem of a movie which I am already looking forward to watching again.

"Paddington Review A Delightful Take on Michael Bonds Literary Creation | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review Paddington Guy Lodge Film Critic guylodge 5 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr November 19 2014 | 1127AM PT Harry Potter producer David Heyman scores again with a bright breezy big-screen debut for the beloved literary bear. ""No bears were harmed in the making of this film"" boast the closing credits of ""Paddington"" -- and happily that promise extends to Michael Bonds ursine literary creation. Fifty-six years after first appearing in print the accident-prone Peruvian furball is brought to high-tech but thoroughly endearing life in this bright breezy and oh-so-British family romp from writer-director Paul King and super-producer David Heyman. Affectionately honoring the everyday quirks of Bonds stories while subtly updating their middle-class London milieu Kings film may divide loyal Paddingtophiles with its high-stakes caper plot but their enraptured kids wont care a whit. If Paddingtons signature line -- ""I think Im in trouble again"" -- is absent from his feature-length debut thats because even the fretful bear should feel bullish about its prospects. With ""Paddington"" out in Blighty on Nov. 28 roaring domestic holiday biz is a given though whether TWC-Dimension can sell U.S. auds on its ample charms when the pic opens Stateside in January is more of a question mark. From its ska-singing sidewalk chorus to the marmalade sandwiches stacked in its heros trademark hat Kings film is thankfully reluctant to neutralize the national flavor of Bonds distinctly English creation. (Substituting Oreo cookies for oatmeal digestives in one witty scene of biscuit analysis is about as egregious as the concessions to foreign auds get.) Nevertheless just as Heymans blockbusting ""Harry Potter"" series cannily fostered global Anglophilia through universal storytelling this intrepid traveler could forge a similar path to more modest international success. After all few figures from childrens literature embody the spirit of cultural curiosity more directly than Paddington Bear a plucky naif who journeys all the way from Lima to London in search of a better life. Kings script written with a story assist from Hamish McColl fills in a more elaborate backstory for him than Bonds books do A swooping colorful first act details Paddingtons blissful childhood with elderly relatives in the rainforests of Peru. The idyll is rudely destroyed by an earthquake that leaves his uncle Pastuzo (voiced by Michael Gambon) dead and his aunt Lucy (voiced by Imelda Staunton) headed to a retirement home. Paddington (voiced by Ben Whishaw a more suitably boyish mid-production replacement for Colin Firth) is left alone to make the transatlantic odyssey. Its a trip of which Lucy had only dreamed since being educated in all things English by a friendly explorer from the Geographers Guild of Great Britain -- a detail illustrated in an amusing introductory pastiche of 1930s newsreels that includes of all things a supremely unlikely reference to Jane Campions ""The Piano."" Such sophisticated in-jokery is to be expected of King Best known for his work on the wildly absurdist TV comedy ""The Mighty Boosh"" hes a pleasingly left-field choice of helmer for this project. Paddingtons eventual arrival at his namesake train station and his subsequent discovery by the well-to-do Brown family hews closely to the setup of Bonds first book ""A Bear Called Paddington"" -- with the key difference that their adoption of the animal is here announced as a temporary measure his plaintive quest for a permanent home driving the films story. As in the books the audience is required to believe that the arrival of a talking bear in London is unusual rather than extraordinary Uptight dad and risk analyst Henry (Hugh Bonneville) is reluctant to take Paddington in but mostly due to the insurance challenges the beast presents. Its his kindly kooky wife Mary (an utterly disarming Sally Hawkins) rather than his wary children Judy and Jonathan (Madeleine Harris and Samuel Joslin both spikier than their golly-gosh counterparts on the page) who persuades him otherwise. Still its not long before the bear begins winning over the family at large with his wide-eyed astonishment at urban living. Its here where the film is forced to part ways most drastically from its literary source Where Bonds books are built from drolly episodic accounts of everyday misadventures thats a tricky structure to maintain in a mainstream childrens film. In the interest of galvanizing the narrative and amping up the peril King and McColl have devised a cheerfully silly action-heavy chase plot that cribs heavily from ""101 Dalmatians"" complete with its own Cruella de Vil bleach-bobbed taxidermist Millicent Clyde (Nicole Kidman) whos determined to nab one particular Peruvian breed of bear for her collection. This narrative development replete with ""Mission Impossible""-style stunts and superb location use of Londons neo-Gothic Natural History Museum may sit slightly oddly with the gentler situational comedy of Paddingtons other exploits but the transition is eased by the films bouncy pacing and consistently dry cockeyed humor in which Londoners seen-it-all cynicism comes in for repeated ribbing. (""Its not much to go on"" a police detective wearily tells Mary after she files a missing-person report for a bear in a blue duffel coat.) Meanwhile Kidman splendidly served by costume designer Lindy Hemming in a range of sexed-up safari gear is having such infectiously vampish fun as the villain -- bringing a Joanna Lumley-style purr even to lines like ""Get stuffed bear"" -- that one can hardly begrudge her presence. Technically the film finds King retaining much of the eccentric visual invention from his independent 2009 debut ""Bunny and the Bull"" albeit with a hefty glob of studio polish. Gary Williamsons excellent primary-colored production design is heavy on nuts-and-bolts gadgetry and clever dolls-house miniaturization that recall the work of Wes Anderson. The Browns West London terrace home (with its interior cherry-tree fresco that seems an oblique nod to ""Mary Poppins"") is an ever-unfolding designers delight. The challenge lies in matching that handcrafted aesthetic to the state-of-the-art visual effects (courtesy chiefly of Framestore the collective that worked miracles on the Heyman-produced ""Gravity"") that allow Paddington such characterful fluidity of movement and expression. The balance is successfully struck with the effects warmly recalling the old-school animatronic work of Jim Henson The film may be a world away from the rudimentary paper-and-plush-toy technique of the BBCs ""Paddington"" shorts from the 1970s but their scrappy spirit is intact.

Droogie says December 6 2014 at 513 pm I saw Paddington tonight - a delightfully funny silly and moving film with a wonderful message of tolerance for people (and bears) coming to the UK for a better life and contributing to British society. Having Jim Broadbent as kindly antiques shop owner Mr Trebus whos character was also a refugee as a boy during the Kindertransport rescue mission during WW2 was a lovely touch.This movie is magical. Reply Ian says November 22 2014 at 757 am Ugh why did you have to mention Joanna Lumley? Thats such a better casting idea. Reply LOL says November 19 2014 at 130 pm Oh great another twee racist and irksome British movie that revels in the notion only posh white people matter. Christ last time I was in London I couldnt hardly see any white folk. Its like rampantly multicultural yet the UK film industry is in complete denial of this actuality. This movie looks atrocious btw. Reply Anthony Jay says November 26 2014 at 818 am Hi LOL Are you commenting on Paddington or some other film? Paddington is about a BEAR not posh white people Duh. And to describe the film as ""twee racist and irksome"" is as far from the truth as it is possible to drift. In fact a cinema exit poll conducted for a UK National Newspaper established that 86% thought the film to be excellent and 14% rated it Very Good. Since 100% said they would recommend it wholeheartedly you might be best advised to Get A Life and stop being such a grouch.
