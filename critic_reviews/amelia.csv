E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Its Oscar season and you know what that means Time to wheel Hilary Swank out for her annual viewing. In ""Amelia she plays the legendary aviator Amelia Earhart and those big horsey incisors of hers may at last have met their match.On the surface the film appears to be a dispiriting awards-season white elephant a triumph of production design period costumes and hollow bio-drama. The movies trailer adds to the sense of deja vu Is this a sequel to ""Out of Africa or a gender-bending remake of ""The Aviator or what? Yet inside ""Amelia is a sharp idea struggling to get out How does a woman marketed to the public as a star turn herself back into a human being? And at what cost?Its a question for our times and the one novelty of Mira Nairs film is that it sets the conundrum in an earlier era when celebrity branding wasnt yet a national way of life. For all its dull pomp ""Amelia is unexpectedly frank about how Earharts public persona - ""Lady Lindy the dashing flying flapper - was an invention of among others publisher George Putnam (Richard Gere). Her first Atlantic crossing in 1928 was a blatant fraud Earhart sat in the back while Wilmer Stutz (Joe Anderson) and Louis Gordon (Aaron Abrams) piloted the plane.After the ticker tape has been swept up Geres Putnam sets Amelia to writing a book posing for fashion shoots endorsing Lucky Strike cigarettes and Kodak cameras and luggage and waffle irons. ""Amelia views this star pimpery with a level gaze leaving judgment up to us. Earhart goes along with the charade because she loves Putnam and she loves being famous (it is after all the American way) but sooner or later her independent streak re-surfaces.In 1932 Earhart flew the Atlantic again this time solo and at the wheel. She worked to promote women fliers and commercial flight. She took Eleanor Roosevelt (Cherry Jones) up for a spin. And she kept an open marriage carrying on a relationship with aeronautics expert Gene Vidal (Ewan McGregor) that Putnam by then her husband had little choice but to accept. As one character makes sure to remind us she lived like a man.The film juggles all this as best it can dropping a number of balls along the way. The primary problem is that Nair (""Monsoon Wedding ""The Namesake) doesnt have the knack for this genre - were not convinced by the corny sweep of ""Amelia because we sense its director isnt. This is one of those movies where the period re-creation - the props and costumes the cars and sconces - feels perfectly crafted and perfectly oppressive. Even Gabriel Yareds score feels left over from some forgotten Richard Attenborough epic.A lesser problem is that McGregor is ridiculous as Vidal an empty tuxedo masquerading as a character. The script by Ron Bass and Anna Hamilton Phelan introduces Vidals young son Gore (William Cuddy) as a worshipful confidante of Amelias but neglects to bring on Putnams two sons by an earlier marriage because I guess they didnt grow up to be famous authors. The movies a critique of celebrity culture that gets weak in the knees at the notion of stardom.Swank rides the thematic turbulence like the star she is. The rawboned self-confidence thats her hallmark dovetails nicely with her subject and if Swanks bleached eyebrows dont convince you her gumption does. I bought her not as Amelia but as this movies Amelia understanding that the performance is a glossy approximation of the real thing - Kansas with a dash of Kate Hepburn - and that expecting the real real thing from Hollywood is foolish.Gere too works at Putnam like a pro even when the script requires him to stare into the distance and intone duff lines like ""Home is wherever you are Amelia. By the final scenes the couple has arrived at a mutual adoration that feels unexpectedly touching. ""Amelia may actually be best for mother-daughter movie dates You get an interestingly problematic role model a little food for thought a few good slacks and a nice big cry.On July 2 1937 Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan (Christopher Eccleston) disappeared over the Pacific Ocean on the final leg of their circumnavigation of the globe. ""Amelia strains to build suspense in its last 20 minutes but since we all know whats going to happen the scenes feel both inevitable and cruel. The films actual climax may have come earlier and more quietly when Earhart is asked by a reporter ""Are you a better celebrity than a pilot? She doesnt come up with a convincing answer and neither does the movie. It asks the question though and thats a start.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

By David Denby Hilary Swank plays Earhart in Mira Nairs new movie.   Credit Illustration by Robert Risko In ""Amelia"" Hilary Swank playing Amelia Earhart the celebrity aviatrix of the nineteen-twenties and thirties has a big toothy smile high cheekbones and short hair that seems to have been chopped with a knife. Earharts clothes--mens pants shirts and leather flying jackets--perfectly suit Swanks lean small-hipped body. The actress carries herself with an endearing mixture of boldness and shyness--the Earhart lope and the Earhart wave with the arm sharply bent have the right degree of awkward casualness. We can see why the fliers androgynous style became chic. In all Swank gives a fine performance as a woman who was both willful and eager to please. Yet except for one fiery moment--when Earhart chews out a balky pilot whose heavy drinking reminds her of her alcoholic father--its not an exciting performance and the way the movie has been conceived it cant be. Earhart was the first woman to fly the Atlantic solo; she accomplished many other airborne feats and became an active campaigner for womens rights. She was a genuine heroine but I can think of little reason to celebrate her as blandly as the director Mira Nair has done here. ""Amelia"" is handsome yet predictable and high-minded--not a dud exactly but too proper too reserved for its swaggering subject. The narrative of Earharts life--constructed by the screenwriters Ron Bass and Anna Hamilton Phelan who adapted biographies by Mary S. Lovell and Susan Butler--is framed by her doomed last flight. She took off from Miami on June 1 1937 at the age of thirty-nine intending to circumnavigate the world at the equator. But somewhere near her mid-Pacific goal of Howland Island she and her navigator Fred Noonan (Christopher Eccleston) disappeared. Once this frame is established the movie swings to the past a rural Kansas girl coltish dreamy physically fearless Amelia starts stunt flying in her twenties and is then tapped as the first woman passenger on a cross-Atlantic flight. She puts up with her passive status grumpily (Swanks mouth turns downward in irritation) but George Putnam (Richard Gere) the publishing heir and public-relations genius who set up Earharts passage turns her into a national celebrity with her own line of clothes and luggage. The movie is candid about Putnams mercenary interest in Earhart and Gere plays him as a shrewd polite fussy opportunist who gradually falls in love with her and accepts her conditions for marriage--that she will be free to do as she likes. All this is presented with no more than moderate energy. The elegant atmosphere of thirties high life--men in dinner suits women in backless silk dresses a black torch singer undulating in a supper club--is enjoyable enough but Nair cant seem to find the dramatic center of it. The film accumulates detail dutifully rather than gathering significance. I was hoping that things would pick up when Ewan McGregor makes his entrance as Gene Vidal (Gores father) the airline executive who becomes Earharts business partner. Earharts affair with Vidal has been whispered about for decades but Nair treats it delicately remotely. What does Earhart want from Vidal that shes not getting from the faithful and attentive Putnam? If its sex the explosion isnt on the screen. (The filmmakers some seventy-five years after the fact appear eager to protect Earhart from scandal even as theyre publicizing the affair.) Not only are the adultery scenes ultra-civilized; Nairs direction in general lacks rhythm and urgency--the characters talk to each other placidly in semiformal complete sentences. Theres only one bit of mischief young Gore fond of Amelia asks her why she cant be married to his father and to Putnam too. Even as a child it seems Vidal wanted to be a swinger. Again and again as Earhart soars around the world Stuart Dryburghs cinematography captures the landscapes below filled with scampering animals and native children. The over-all visual style is pretty even luscious in a familiar National Geographic sort of way. But Martin Scorsese did a lot better in ""The Aviator"" by aggressively styling Howard Hughes and the heroic-aviation period as a kind of Art Deco poster. Alas the impression of fervent cliche isnt helped by Earharts remarks. ""I want to be free . . . to be a vagabond of the air"" may be a real quote but it sounds too much like a feminist inspirational handbook. The air she says becomes ""a simple safe beautiful place where everything is comprehensible"" a line that might resonate if the rest of life were incomprehensible to her. But as far as we can tell with Putnams constant help she gets along extremely well. The most stirring sight in the movie is the airplanes including the Lockheed Vega 5B a red short-winged mono-engine job as fat as a bumblebee. Theyre like the planes in an old childrens book and after watching Amelia take off in these picturesque crates were relieved to see her in something with the size and the heft of the Lockheed Electra 10E a twin-engine silver beauty--though that plane turns out to be the vehicle of her destruction. The scenes of missed communications between Earhart and the radio operators stationed off Howland Island are an anguished reconstruction of what feels like simple technical inadequacy yet the filmmakers dont dramatize this final flight as the half-insane event that it was. Earhart was warned that she would run out of fuel. Was she foolish and vain as well as heroic? Irony however doesnt fall within Nairs range. Made straight in this way ""Amelia"" should have come out in 1940 or even in 1970 when a rebellious and physically courageous woman was a fresh and bracing sight. At this point the picture fails to break new ground in the air. Valery Gergiev the artistic director of the Mariinsky Theatre (formerly the Kirov Opera and Ballet) in St. Petersburg--a whirlwind who is also the principal conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra and a guest conductor just about everywhere else--advises a young conductor standing before the members of an orchestra to tell them ""with your eyes."" Gergiev tells them with his eyes chin gut elbows and hands which appear alternately as claws and as palms flattened and fluttering like leaves. Allan Millers documentary feature ""You Cannot Start Without Me--Valery Gergiev Maestro"" doesnt solve the question that has puzzled music lovers for two decades How does Gergiev do everything he does? Theres no easy explanation for physical and spiritual energy like this. But its clear from Millers interviews with Gergiev that he sees himself as the heir to Tchaikovsky Stravinsky and Shostakovich. Working with the London Symphony on Stravinskys ""Rite of Spring"" he groans roars and coos. Hes very precise about details of coloration and the players seem awed theyre getting their Russianness from the ground up. With his heavy eyebrows and dark stubble Gergievs appearance is the furthest remove from the voluptuous elegance of the white-maned Bernstein or von Karajan. This conductor looks like a thug. His mode of expression may be soulful yet the movie though conventional in form brings us close to an elemental ferocity just barely held in check. Its a temperament that has its drawbacks. As Gergiev makes clear he is trapped by his ambition into making an endless series of commitments that in effect destroy the rest of his life. In a moment that is both touching and slightly embarrassing he holds his three young children and admits that he isnt much of a father. His gifts lie elsewhere. Fanatical artistic dedication is also the subject of Frederick Wisemans ""La Danse"" a portrait of the Paris Opera Ballet. Miller lets us know with titles who is performing and where; Wiseman proceeding in his customary manner presents long scenes without identifying anyone. Were on our own which makes us feel as Wiseman haunts the stairways rehearsal studios and watery subterranean corridors of the Palais Garnier (the Ballets home) that we have become with him phantoms of the opera. The Ballet is a huge organism at the center of which is Brigitte Lefevre the tentacular administrative head. Shes a little overbearing and Wiseman with evident pleasure turns back to the dancers whom he photographs not in the manner of the commercial cinema where bodies are broken up into threshing limbs but in full frame top to bottom with space around them so that we can see the incredible moves the dancers are capable of along with inevitably their mistakes missteps and gradual improvements. So many of Wisemans films have been about institutions (a police force a battered-womens shelter) that didnt work well or that merely penned up broken-down Americans who fall off the tracks of economic and physical success. Its a joyous experience to see an institution in full flower--to see not dereliction and disorder but the many forms of striving and virtue.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Female Trouble Lars von Triers highbrow horror show. Plus The awkward joys of Gentlemen Broncos. _ By David Edelstein Published Oct 26 2009 ShareThis (Photo Christian Geisnaes/Courtesy of IFC Films) Props to Lars von Trier for managing to revive an idea that Judeo-Christian teaching the Enlightenment and feminism have helped us to suppress that misogyny is a sound religious position. In his latest cinematic mugging cheekily titled Antichrist the baleful Dane confines a man He (Willem Dafoe) and a woman She (Charlotte Gainsbourg) to a cabin deep in the woods (its called Eden). There He attempts to heal Shes psychic wounds with that most paternalistic of tools psychotherapy. Dont run away from your pain he says gently. Let it out. This goes on for some time (the film is divided into four chapters) with He laying Freudian hands on She She mocking Freud and Von Trier serving up horror-movie visions like the talking fox that announces Chaos reigns. Since the film begins with the couple having (hard-core) sex while their toddler toddles out the window (in lyrical slow-motion his stuffed animal bouncing and coming to rest beside his dead body) its tough to care about either of these self-centered people the psychobabbling prat or the bad slutty mother. Its only in the last chapterwhen She plunges a butcher knife into his crotch and He realizes what his therapeutic plumbing has loosed upon the worldthat the movies true monster (and faith) is revealed. Von Trier has said he made Antichrist after a depression and for all its artiness its revealing It should clear up any doubts about his attitude toward the fair sex. Its true that in most of his movies women are punished unjustly even martyred but its hard to shake off the feeling that he digs putting his female characters (and the actresses who play them) through the wringer. They might believe theyre innocent. They might not mean to be demonic. Its just their natureor more precisely their connection to what Camille Paglia calls chthonian Nature in all its wild primal force. (Paglia celebrates the chthonian goddess; Von Trier gravitates toward burning her.) See Also  A Squeamish Persons Guide to Seeing Antichrist  Lars von Trier Reviews His Reviews  The Ten Most Brutalized Wangs in Movie History Should you see Antichrist? Its good for a few bad laughs but you have to be up for a castration a clitoridectomy and a lot of symbolism. You have to be up for watching Dafoe and Gainsbourgthe latest in a line of masochistic stars to submit to this high priest of cinema and film-festival darlinghumiliate themselves. Von Trier has said he wanted to make a genre horror picture but he couldnt even come up with a decent metaphor The climax is out of a Grade C hack-em-up with people chasing each other through the woods with axes and knives. David Cronenberg explored a similar theme in The Brood in which a male psychiatrists est-like exhortation to a woman to go all the way through her trauma produces not inner peace but deformed psychotic babies that hammer people she doesnt like to death. Now thats entertainment There is one poignant aspect of Antichrist. He pleads with She not to blame herself for the death of their son but it turns out that it was her fault that mothers can be creatures of chill narcissistic indifference. When Von Trier appeared via a teleconferencing link at a New York Film Festival press screening (hes also travel-phobic) a questioner expressed skepticism that any mother could be so cold. You didnt know my mother the director replied. I liked him at that moment. He looked quasi-human. Unlike von Trier Jared Hess (Napoleon Dynamite) makes gross-out Freudian body-horror movies full of tender sympathy. The world of the flesh is icky but oh the spirit soarson even the tackiest wings. Gentlemen Broncos is the atrocious title of an enchantingly freakish comedy that centers on Benjamin (Michael Angarano) a teen who writes Dune-like sci-fi tomes (The Yeast Lords) in which he sublimates like mad to relieve his sexual discomfort. No Hess doesnt spell it out but by the third or fourth time Benjamins fictional hero (Sam Rockwell)in garish Pop Art fantasy sequencesloses his gonads and faces off against giant laser-blasting mammaries he doesnt really need to. Theres enough weird breast imagery in this movie to make Robert Crumb murmur This guys got issues. Angaranos Benjamin moves through the world on the verge of tears looking as if he wanted to will his body out of existence. Ive never seen a teen hero so stricken but then everyone in Hesss movies appears to be suffering from some unspecified gastrointestinal distress. Gentlemen Broncos is best when Hess doesnt force the grotesquerie but casually lets you observe. Theres a bit when bodice-ripper writer Tabitha (Halley Feiffer a whiz with deadpan) squirts lotion all over her hand and asks an aghast Benjamin to rub it in as her rictus-faced friend Lonnie (Hector Jimenez) leans into her ear issuing moose calls and crunching potato chips; David Lynch would murmur This guys got issues. 1 2 Next Share this story...

"Amelia reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Amelia reviewed. Amelia reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 23 2009 416 PM Amelia I wish biopics like this would get lost at sea. By Dana Stevens Hillary Swank in Amelia Amelia (Fox Searchlight Pictures) the biopic is many things that Amelia Earhart the pilot never was decorous conventional sanitized dull. Directed by Mira Nair and executive-produced by its star Hilary Swank the movie seems oddly preoccupied with the audiences approval for its subject. Its not enough that Earhart was a pioneering aviator the first woman (and the second person) to successfully cross the Atlantic solo and that she vanished mysteriously during an attempt to be the first person to circumnavigate the equator. We cant really care about the life of Amelia Earhart this movie believes unless shes beautiful sweet stylishly dressed madly in love with her husband and 99.9 percent heterosexual. That soft-pedaling is a shame in particular because Earhart is being played by an actress whos at her best when shes none of these things. Despite her two Oscars and impressive technical chops Swank has never managed to become an actor that audiences connect to as Americas sweetheart. We like her bruised driven obsessed a little angry like the cross-dressing heroine of Boys Dont Cryor the pugilistic monomaniac of Million Dollar Baby. And by all accounts Amelia Earhart was just such an obsessive sort. In this New Yorker piece on Earhart Judith Thurman describes an ambitious and canny self-marketer who willingly collaborated with her agent and husband George Putnam in crafting her public image. But perhaps for fear that Earharts likability will be diminished if shes seen enjoying much less seeking fame Nair and her screenwriters are careful to demonstrate that this Amelia shrinks from the speaking gigs and luggage endorsements that help fund her global expeditions. Advertisement Richard Gere in roguish Billy Flynn mode plays Putnam the publishing mogul and proto-PR agent who proposed to Earhart six times before she finally said yes. Putnam and Earharts union was an unusual even radically modern one--on the day of their wedding she gave him a letter that read in part ""I shall not hold you to any medieval code of faithfulness nor shall I consider myself bound to you similarly""--but Nairs film goes to great lengths to bathe George and Amelias marriage in a rosy light. After she cheats on her husband with aviation pioneer Gene Vidal (Ewan McGregor taking his usual glazed inertia to new heights) Amelia must be shown breaking off the affair and weeping with regret--in real life its not clear that she and Vidal ever stopped seeing each other. As for the rumors about Earharts lesbianism theyre addressed only in two oblique scenes one where sitting in a bar with Vidal she admires a womans legs and another where she turns down Putnams proposal with ""Im not the marrying kind."" Theres no need to throw in wild speculation about Earharts imagined Sapphic grapplings but if the subtext is going to remain that submerged why let it peek out at all? If you can get past Amelias maddening devotion to niceness the movie does boast a few soaring set pieces. Though it takes place in the 20s and 30s Amelia is full of cinematic tricks from the 80s mock black-and-white newsreels that morph into full-color scenes and a swooping romantic score by Gabriel Yared that especially when it accompanies Stuart Dryburghs camera upward through banks of clouds recalls the flight scenes in Out of Africa. A little more aviation wonkery would have been welcome If Earhart and Vidals affair really was sparked by their joint love of flying shouldnt their pillow talk have involved aerial refueling and wind shear? But the flight scenes are engaging enough that by the time Amelia leaves on her final round-the-world trip with the alcoholic navigator Fred Noonan (Christopher Eccleston) were invested enough to root for them despite the foregone conclusion of their awful end. The tense final scenes posit a theory about what happened to Earhart over the Pacific thats in line with the conclusion reached by most of her biographers a combination of chance mishaps and faulty communications between Earhart and a Coast Guard ship stationed belowresulted in her plane running out of fuel before she could locate the tiny landing strip built for her on Howland Island. The audience is spared from witnessing the actual impact but watching the series of decisions and missteps that led up to it you realize what a stubborn ambitious amazing person the real Amelia Earhart must have been to attempt this flight. Its enough to make you wish someone would make a movie about her. Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Rick Groen From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Thursday Oct. 22 2009 344PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 318PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Amelia Directed by Mira Nair Written by Ron Bass and Anna Hamilton Phelan Starring Hilary Swank Richard Gere Ewan McGregor Classification PG Amelia is the Mack truck of flight. Heavy and lumbering it delivers the goods but theres not an ounce of magic in the thing. And since the Amelia in question is Earhart the famous aviatrix lets just say this is a movie with a harmony problem - seldom has a bios style clashed so deafeningly with its content. The trouble starts right from takeoff when the establishing scenes are laden with exposition and leaden with voice-over. ""Who wants a life imprisoned in safety?"" asserts our pert young pilot in an early frame only to see the rest of the flick safely pack her life into the imprisoning trailer of that lumbering truck. From there it heads to the requisite unloading docks where the seminal events all squeaky clean and bound in bubble wrap get dropped off for our inspection. I believe were meant to be inspired. Lest anyone miss that point the bubble wrap comes with bubble dialogue designed to point us in the right direction Hallmark offerings like ""Everyone has oceans to fly"" and ""I want to be free to be a vagabond of the air."" Yes the compass is always pointing due S for Sententious. Unloading dock No. 1 returns us to 1928 when Amelia (Hilary Swank) becomes the first woman to fly across the Atlantic - alas only as a passenger although the script eager to firm up her feminist credentials suggests that the dumb-ass guys in the cockpit would have been lost without her. Then a mere four years later she cements her legend by making the trip solo. If Mira Nairs direction can be believed both journeys were plagued by the same heavy weather as the plucky Amelia battles rain wind ice and really lame CGI effects. Even the aerial shots which typically guarantee grandeur are lacking in aerial beauty here - never has flight seemed so pedestrian. Ditto for her earthbound doings. Right quick she falls for George Putnam (Richard Gere) an early PR maestro who wins her heart while honing her image (""Lady Lindy thats what theyll call you""). Of course being a feminist icon Amelia must make the first move stopping by his hotel room in her sexy silk PJs. And when wedding bells ring she insists on drafting a prenup that with her characteristic Hallmark flourish gives him fair warning ""I cant endure the confinement of even an attractive cage."" Duly foreshadowed enter the love triangle - a short-lived and soon-disabused fling with the handsome Gene Vidal (Ewan McGregor) who happens to be the daddy of that writerly Vidal then just a child. Indeed at one delicious point Amelia is seen instructing little Gore on how to overcome his fears - a lesson big Gore would learn rather too well. Elsewhere on the triangulated map Eleanor Roosevelt makes an appearance whereupon the two first ladies share an excited night together - aloft in a plane. Whether this literal trip has any metaphoric connotation is left well up in the air. Swank whos usually at her Oscar-best playing doomed figures is doomed herself here. Labouring under the burden of all that carry-on luggage - Amelia the pioneer the adventurer the feminist the lover the aphorist - she has neither the time nor the strength to create an actual living/breathing character. Instead sporting a blond bob and a connect-the-dot set of painted freckles Swank settles for looking the part. As for sounding the part thats a whole other issue. Much like the icons last fateful flight her accent is damned hard to locate. Just a guess but Id put it in a holding pattern somewhere between Kansas and Kate Hepburn. Speaking of that tragic final flight her foreshortened attempt to circumnavigate the globe it struck me as the best sequence in the movie. Then again it also struck me as a sure sign that both movie and heroine were approaching their end. Either way one thing is certain Nothing becomes Amelia like its imminent departure.

In a cockpit Amelia Earhart looks beatific. Freckled with hair cowlicked not coiffed the legendary aviator gazes out. What she sees makes glorious images from a final flight. Her thoughts her voice-over send us back to a time when a planes arc above a Kansas field established a girls passion for flight and fueled her destiny. ""Amelia"" flies forward. Amid great fanfare Earhart (Hilary Swank) the first woman to make a solo flight across the Atlantic poses on the wing of her silvery Lockheed Electra. Nearby stands her husband publisher George P. Putnam (Richard Gere). Earhart is set to embark on a globe-traversing flight. The plane lifts. The score swells -- one might even say soars. But ""Amelia"" sputters more than it takes flight. Its not for lack of trying. The film is mindful of the rich tensions in the iconic Americans story the drive to achieve something lasting the weird bubble of celebrity the challenges of romance when your first love is something other than another person. Yet written by Ron Bass and Anna Hamilton Phelan and based on two biographies (""East to the Dawn"" and ""The Sound of Wings"") the movie is as conventional a biopic as Earhart was an unconventional woman. Its no help to director Mira Nair that audiences can see biographical films in theaters now that reveal and revel in their protagonists with more flair -- ""Coco Before Chanel"" and ""An Education"" among them. Stylistically ""Amelia"" harks back to the era in which the story unfolds the late 20s and early 30s. Theres a reliance on close-ups orchestral notes glam period touches. But the star-making machinery overwhelms the performances. ""Amelia"" isnt a flying machine with an adventurer at the wheel. Its more like an Airbus with attractive passengers. Ewan McGregor plays Amelias lover Gene Vidal a West Point man and figure in commercial aviation. The characters son Gore makes an appearance. Putnam and Earhart meet when the publisher seeks a female pilot to become the first woman to cross the Atlantic. Putnam printed Charles Lindberghs autobiography. Earharts first flight across the Atlantic was maneuvered with semantics She was the commander not the pilot. Later she made good on the claim. Considered an inventor of public relations Putnam was a showman. Yet theres not a lot of razzle to his dazzle. Geres performances -- the familiar mix of twinkling eyes aware smirk-- often suggest a distance between actor and character; here thats more so especially when he delivers lines like ""This is America and Im obligated to make as much money as I can."" On a number of occasions Swank is required to deliver impassioned reminders to the men in her life that her first deepest love is flight. One wishes the filmmakers had captured that ardor. There is a moment of incandescent joy. After a White House dinner Earheart takes Eleanor Roosevelt (Cherry Jones) on a night flight over the nations capital. The pilot encourages the first lady to take hold of the yoke. Ahh what delight what power. ""Amelia"" is rated PG. It is a heros saga that could encourage the young to dream big. A close-up of a little girl looking at the pilot during a fuel stop before her plane was lost in the Pacific nearly screams ""Look She excited girls."" But Earharts passion remains a mystery. Making visible the pleasures of the ""freedom"" Earhart craved might not be an easy task but it would have been the right cinematic one. (Early scenes in ""The Aviator"" for example are a thrilling declaration of flights wonder.) Swank is sturdy watchable as Earhart. But the films finest moments belong to Christopher Eccleston who plays Fred Noonan the navigator who disappeared with Earhart. By the time Noonan clasps his hands and looks to be bowing his head the chronology of ""Amelia"" has looped back to the fated flight. Above a vast ocean the two aim for Howland Island a speck in the Pacific. In a tart scene earlier gifted celestial navigator and earthbound drinker Noonan had challenged Earhart about her relationships. Now he provides a pantomime of faith in pilot Earhart but also a sincere wish that God be a co-pilot too.

"Movie Review Amelia washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On >> This StoryRead +|Watch +|Talk +| Comments Correction to This Article A review of the film ""Amelia"" gave an incorrect date for aviator Amelia Earharts first solo transatlantic flight. It occurred in 1932. Amelia Movie Review Amelia VideoAmeliaHilary Swank stars as pilot and icon Amelia Earhart in this biopic.>> LAUNCH VIDEO PLAYER Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday October 23 2009 Amelia Earhart wore pants. Also mens neckties and a boys tousled haircut. And she refused to cover up her abundant freckles with makeup -- at least according to ""Amelia"" a drama starring Hilary Swank as the pioneering aviator. This StoryAmelia Swanks Earhart Too good to be trueWomen amp; filmAmeliaDiscuss Biopics That Should Be Made But Havent YetView All Items in This StoryView Only Top Items in This Story She also took a rather casual attitude toward sexual fidelity in her marriage to publisher George Putnam (Richard Gere). Meaning she fooled around like well a guy in the words of one of her flyboy pals navigator Fred Noonan (Christopher Eccleston). Oh yeah. She also became in 1928 the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic during a time when a lot of women didnt even drive. Later she and Noonan would come darn close to circumnavigating the globe. That is until their plane disappeared over the Pacific in 1937. Earhart was in short an unconventional woman. Extraordinary even. So why does this biography directed by Mira Nair (""The Namesake"") from a script by Ron Bass and Ann Hamilton Phelan feel so . . . by the book? (Two actually. Its based on ""East to the Dawn"" and ""The Sound of Wings."") Could it be because most us already know all that stuff about Earharts accomplishments and still-mysterious death? As the film opens with Earhart about to set off on what was to be her last global adventure who cant see how its all going to end? Even for those who never heard of the woman the film telegraphs its unhappy conclusion. Are you going to give up flying a reporter asks after achieving this milestone? ""Not while theres still life left in me"" Earhart answers portentously. Nair has Swank repeat the line again toward the end of the film just in case youre really thick. Not that there isnt loads of inherent drama in this life story. The proto-feminist flier had to overcome enormous sexism just to be taken seriously in the cockpit. In an earlier transatlantic crossing before going solo Earhart was relegated to passenger status. Though given the title of ""commander"" she sat in the back seat while a man did the actual flying. And the trips themselves were fraught with danger as Putnam reminds us over and over again how many people have died attempting to do what Earhart did. Maybe thats part of the problem. Theres so much story to tell here that too much of it is told rather than shown. ""Weve been flying for 19 hours plus"" shouts Bill (Joe Anderson) the pilot who manned the controls during Earharts first transatlantic crossing. Nair even resorts to that hoariest of film tricks the spinning-newspaper-headline montage as a kind of expository shorthand. Look nobodys asking for a miniseries here but at times the movie feels more like a History Channel documentary -- respectful to the point of reverential -- than a rip-snorting yarn. And thats despite a scene where Earhart almost falls out of the plane while soaring over the Atlantic Ocean in what looks like an airborne tin can. Would that the film had taken as many risks. When it comes to some of the wild speculation that has arisen over the years about what happened to Earhart during that final flight the movie doesnt even go out on a limb opting instead for the sort of vague open ending that is historically safe and cinematically dull. It doesnt seem to have helped matters either that Swank is the films executive producer. As sometimes happens when movie stars give themselves jobs theres a whiff of a vanity project about ""Amelia."" After one too many close-ups of Earharts freckled face screwed up in cucumber-cool determination at the throttle the film starts to feel like little more than a vehicle for advancing the two-time Oscar-winning actresss award-season chances. In the end the biggest mystery isnt what happened to the pilot but what happened to the human being. Sure the character as played by Swank has flaws. But not many. Theres so much pluck and gumption on the screen you can smell it. Flesh and blood? Not so much. But who can blame Swank for being drawn to Earharts life? Its an inspiration to little girls everywhere. Those looking for something a little more grown up are like the aviator out of luck.  A1/2 PG. At area theaters. Contains a couple of mild vulgarities brief sensuality smoking and dangerous flying. 111 minutes. >> This StoryRead +|Watch +|Talk +| Comments (c) 2009 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  Swanks Earhart Too good to be true Women amp; film Amelia Discuss Biopics That Should Be Made But Havent Yet",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/22/AR2009102201462.html,200,amelia7,amelia,washingtonpost

A lazy coffee-table book of a movie ""Amelia"" is dressed to the nines with nowhere to go its hackneyed script and Mira Nairs unfocused direc tion never allowing Hilary Swanks performance as legendary aviatrix Amelia Earhart to soar. This is the sort of movie best watched on DVD with the sound off better to appreciate the gorgeous cinematography (Stuart Dryburgh) production design (Stephanie Carroll) and costumes (Kasia Walicka-Maimone). Swank winner of two Oscars for Best Actress wears those costumes very well. With close-cropped hair the androgynous actress is the spitting image of Earhart who became the most famous woman in the world after duplicating Charles Lindberghs feat of crossing the Atlantic in a solo flight. But the actress whose Kansas-born Earhart sports a weird brogue is badly let down by her director and the script. The latter keeps telling us about Amelias love of flying -- at one point plagiarizing Walt Whitman -- but Nair fails to find any coherent way to communicate this visually as Martin Scorsese did in ""The Aviator."" What we get is a series of travelogue scenes tracing Earharts final flight an attempt to become the first pilot to circumnavigate the globe that ended with her still-unexplained disappearance over the Pacific in 1937. These scenes are intercut with increasingly tedious tableaux of historical events punctuated by faux newsreels. Earhart is self-consciously presented as a feminist icon clumsily underlined when she takes Eleanor Roosevelt (Cherry Jones) for a flight over Washington. According to this version Earharts push for publicity as ""Lady Lindy"" and for commercial endorsements (a luggage line still carries her name) were instigated entirely by her husband publisher George Putnam (Richard Gere strolling through a role he seems to realize hes too old for). Part of the reason ""Amelia"" is so boring is that the filmmakers carefully airbrush out anything that might make Earhart seem like an actual human being. The film discreetly tiptoes around rumors of Earharts reputed bisexuality (""Maybe at one time"" she says) and her relationship with aviation pioneer Gene Vidal (Ewan McGregor impersonating a department-store dummy). Some historians believe Vidal was Earharts lover but Nair leaves it at one improbable kiss in a hotel elevator (remember she was the most famous woman in the world) and several scenes of Amelia inspiring Vidals young son Gore who grew up to be a famous novelist. A potentially interesting subplot about a teenage flier (Mia Wasikowska) who briefly threatens Earharts celebrity is abruptly truncated. The film picks up momentum in the last 30 minutes when Nair manages to wring some suspense out of Amelias final hours before her disappearance. But even here the film doesnt mention the intriguing theory that Earhart was in fact spying on the Japanese when her plane vanished in the Pacific. The explanation given in ""Amelia"" is far less gripping and dramatically facile. The film blames her hard-drinking navigator (Christopher Eccleston) who lets her down just like her alcoholic father did. Considering this is the first-ever theatrical biopic of Earhart she deserves better. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Bon Jovi gives Jersey a good name Read Next Bon Jovi gives Jersey a good name Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 66048 How Hillary blew her big moment 33379 Malia Obama skipped the DNC for Lollapalooza 19744 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary Jill and Joe Biden stop traffic on Fifth Avenue Ex-Focus Features CEO thanks company for firing him SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> The aerial photography in this biopic looks slick as does two-time Oscar winner Hilary Swank as the rangy pioneer aviatrix Amelia Earhart who went missing in 1937 while trying to circumnavigate the globe in her flying machine. But oh mama the minute the characters open their mouths the onslaught of cliches brings the movie down in flames. The god-awful script by Ron Bass (Rain Man) and Anna Hamilton Phelan (Gorillas in the Mist) is assaultive in its insistence that ""dreams have no boundaries"" and other sentiments that even Hallmark would reject as too fucking much. ""Who wants a life imprisoned in safety?"" Amelia asks in a voice-over. And you want to shout ""This movie does honey. Theres not a real or spontaneous minute in it. More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Director Mira Nair (Monsoon Wedding The Namesake) is too good to let this happen. So Im just going to assume she was coerced by no-taste producers. No way could Amelias life have been this deadly dull. And the love triangle the screenplay cooks up would fail a test in elementary chemistry. Amelia marries publisher George Putnam (Richard Gere) who markets her career to fund her flights but she sneaks off with aeronautics whiz Gene Vidal (Ewan McGregor). Did I just make this sound interesting? Forgive me. Amelia strikes more sparks with Genes little boy who grows up to be -- ready? -- Gore Vidal. If only Gore could have injected some of his literate mischief into this platitudinous invitation to dozing. The flying scenes -- postcard-pretty images from cinematographertuart Dryburgh lathered up by Gabriel Yareds sudsy score -- vie with relentless close-ups of Swank in the cockpit of her twin-engine Lockheed L-10 Electra ing into space at what -- a better script? Who could blame her? Amelia the Kansas tomboy changed aviation. Her sometimes reckless insistence on breaking boundaries coaxed women into flying planes as well as wearingrendy trousers. But innovation takes a back seat to endless visions of Swank smiling through as she and her navigator (Christopher Eccleston in the films best and unfussiest performance) are last seen flying over the Pacific. The fact that Amelias plane and body were never found remains a lasting mystery. The only mystery about this waxwork of a movie is why it was ever made.

(AP Photo/Fox Searchlight Ken Woroner) Photo Ken Woroner AP Review Amelia cant overcome obstacle 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Amelia Biographical drama. Starring Hilary Swank and Richard Gere. Directed by Mira Nair. (PG. 103 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Making a film of Amelia Earharts life was never going to be easy. Downer endings are a challenge and inconclusive endings are flat-out problematic and its difficult to evoke the grand spirit of adventure when an audience is sitting there wondering if the heroine was killed on impact starved on a life raft or was eaten by sharks. Going out in a blaze of glory is one thing but an ellipsis followed by a question mark ...? Not very dramatic. These challenges could have been surmounted at the drafting stage of ""Amelia"" had the screenwriters devised some specific purpose or point in revisiting the life of the pioneering aviatrix who disappeared somewhere over the Pacific in 1937. But what we have in this movie instead is a conventional heroines tale about a plucky young American who did brave things and became famous. Director Mira Nair dresses that up with visual grace with shots of clouds and sky that are beautiful and elusive enough to escape the tinge of cliche. But the basic bones of the story are the problem here. Still it could have been worse. Contrary to what you might expect the seemingly obligatory scene does not appear No one says to Richard Gere who plays Amelias husband ""Your wife is missing"" which means Gere doesnt get to do his usual thing of scrunching up his face and breathing as if he were in a Lamaze class. However Amelia does get to meet Gore Vidal the son of her lover Gene Vidal and she spends an inordinate amount of time calling the boy by name as if resisting the temptation to address him by his full title ""Little Gore the future famous novelist."" Swank who plays Earhart looks something like her and she conveys the charm that everyone says Earhart had but that doesnt come across in still pictures. On the downside Swank doesnt seem nearly as tough or as serious as Earhart does in photos. The film which is interspersed throughout with scenes from her last flights begins Amelias story in 1928 when she was chosen as a crew member (really just a passenger) on a transatlantic flight. She spent the rest of her life living up to the fame that flight brought her taking risks and setting records. The film is at its best in the air giving us the flavor of early aviation and dramatizing some of the tense moments from Earharts travels. But the movie soon pivots from that to concentrate on her personal life on her marriage to publisher George Putnam (Gere) and her affair with Gene Vidal (Ewan McGregor). Aside from the obvious - Earhart was distinctive because she was an aviator not because she had a sex life so why concentrate on the less interesting element? - there is something just a little phony and cloying about the films portrayal of the marriage. George is supposed to be a wonderful fellow but he seems creepy and not just because Gere plays him though that helps. Theres simply something about the whole George-Amelia dynamic that doesnt ring true either a fault of the script or the actors or of missing information. Normally this wouldnt be a problem except that the George-Amelia relationship becomes the films emotional locus. Its a weak one. Still they try. ""Amelia"" was made with a conscientious regard for the period. Swank and Gere talk like the people in early 1930s newsreels with accents that have vanished along with that generation. Swank looks uncomfortable speaking that way at times but she manages. The films basic material that is the history is not without interest. And it must be admitted that every so often - for about 10 seconds every 10 minutes - we get a hint of the movie they wanted to make and hoped they were making One about the thrill of early aviation and the promise of a young century. -- Advisory This film contains mild sexual situations.

"Amelia Earharts personality missing in action | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesAmelia Earharts personality missing in actionThe Hallmark Cards people arent mentioned in the credits for Mira Nairs Amelia  and yet the ear insists they must have been involved.Hilary Swank stars as Amelia Earhart in a movie that was largely filmed in Toronto but fails to exploit the aviatrixs real-life adventures here before trying to fly solo around the world.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Oct. 23 2009Starring Hilary Swank George Putnam Ewan McGregor and Christopher Eccleston. Directed by Mira Nair. 111 minutes. At major theatres. PGThe Hallmark Cards people arent mentioned in the credits for Mira Nairs Amelia and yet the ear insists they must have been involved.Every utterance by Hilary Swank in her interpretation of flying legend Amelia Earhart seems like either a motivational bromide (""What do dreams know of boundaries?"") or a statement of female empowerment (""I want to be free"").Courting Oscar with unseemly lust while also promoting Earhart as an early feminist the film strives too hard to be profound and not enough to be merely human. Swank bears a resemblance to Earhart but her problematic accent sounds more like Annie Oakley and her various declarations are almost entirely banal.Article Continued BelowWhats lacking is any real sense of the woman behind the cardboard sentiments the one who grew from a Kansas farm girl fascinated by flight into a record-breaking aviatrix whose mysterious 1937 disappearance over the South Pacific still fascinates the public mind.The screenplay by Ron Bass and Anna Hamilton is interested only in the Earhart of public acclaim and purported scandal. Drawing from two Earhart biographies (Susan Butlers East to the Dawn and Mary S. Lovells The Sound of Wings) they narrowly limit their view to the decade from her 1928 rise to fame to her 1937 disappearance.Despite Earharts famous claim that she flew ""for the fun of it"" the movie wants us to believe that her airborne ambitions were driven by a desire to outperform any man and that craving also applied to the bedroom. Shes seen to be as casual about sex as any male playboy demanding a prenuptial agreement of tolerated infidelity before accepting a marriage proposal from George Putnam (Richard Gere) her New York publisher and promoter. The pre-nup comes in handy when she falls for the charms of Gene Vidal (Ewan McGregor) a pilot and aeronautics professor who also happens to be the father of writer Gore Vidal (William Cuddy).It is puzzling how little director Nair makes of this odd romantic triangle given her past panache in handling emotional entanglements in earlier films such as Monsoon Wedding. It all seems perfunctory here and fatally for the movie neither Gere nor McGregor impress as love interests. Geres Putman in particular seems more Svengali than suitor constantly dreaming up ways to cash in on his womans notoriety much as he did earlier with his other client Charles Lindbergh who is unseen in the movie but serves as both inspiration and rival to Earhart.Equally confounding is the almost complete lack of reference to Earharts formative years including Toronto connections that would have made fine use of the films lensing locations here in Hogtown where several scenes were shot (including a well-disguised Union Station and Royal York Hotel). Earhart worked as a nurse in Toronto during World War I tending wounded soldiers and it is this city where she is said to have found her vocation to fly.She attended the annual air show at the CNE and later told a story of how a mischievous pilot spotted her on the ground and dive-bombed her with his biplane hoping to make her run. Earhart instead held her ground refusing to be intimidated while at the same time vowing to become a pilot herself. Wouldnt this have made a great movie moment?The flying adventures that Nair does include help keep the movie aloft. Nair wisely eschews CGI using real airplanes and handheld cameras to build realism and suspense and Swank is at her gritted-teeth best in these well-mounted scenes.Nair focuses on three major events in Earharts career her 1928 crossing of the Atlantic Ocean with two male pilots the first time a woman had flown the Pond; her 1932 Atlantic solo flight also the first by a woman which earned her the ""Lady Lindy"" nickname; and finally her 1937 attempt to circumnavigate the globe at the Equator a dangerous feat that would have been a first for either gender. Instead Earhart and her navigator Fred Noonan (Christopher Eccleston) vanished midway across the Pacific presumed to have run out of gas and drowned while approaching the tiny U.S. military base called Howland Island.This latter event is foreshadowed throughout the movie culminating in genuine drama but the real Earhart remains as elusive as the whereabouts of her final resting place.""Theres more to life than being a passenger"" she says early on but the film ultimately takes all of us for a ride.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsWhen and why Sophie Gregoire Trudeau accepts designer giftsFive fashion gifts given to Sophie Gregoire Trudeau have come to light recently with some people criticizing her acceptance of them though the items fall within Canadian conflict of interest guidelines.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

(Fox Searchlight) Joe Neumaier Friday October 23 2009 1223 PM Title Amelia ""Amelia"" plays like a long-lost relic from another era. Not the 1930s -- when aviatrix Amelia Earhart was Americas most famous woman -- or even the 1950s when Jimmy Stewart played Charles Lindbergh in ""The Spirit of St. Louis."" No this embalmed drama is a ghost from the 80s a decade that regularly produced surprise-free caramelized biopics. The airless ""Amelia"" is missing practically everything.Cliches abound in the script by Ron Bass (""Rain Man"") and Anna Hamilton Phelan (""Mask"" ""Gorillas in the Mist""). Helpful facts fill every conversation -- ""No ones flown the Atlantic solo since Lindbergh and 14 have died trying"" -- as director Mira Nair hits her quota of popping flashbulbs barking reporters and period newspaper headlines.And though star Hilary Swank does eerily resemble the flier ""Amelia"" defines Earhart as simply single-minded. Her proto-feminist ideals and unshakable sense of moral freedom are simply given lip service; the film doesnt even bother to question where they came from.The story toggles between Earharts final flight in which she and navigator Fred Noonan attempted to circumnavigate the globe in 1937 and various events beginning in 1928 when she became the first woman to fly the Atlantic. Her fame grows thanks to publisher G.P. Putnam (Richard Gere) who becomes first her publicist and then her husband -- although Amelia affirms her autonomy by embarking on a lengthy affair with socialite and airline founder Gene Vidal (Ewan McGregor).Triumphant landings and ticker-tape parades follow as do product endorsements White House dinners and a return to Putnam. Then in her second attempt to fly round the world Earhart misses a refueling rendezvous in the Pacific and disappears at age 39.That event of course spawned some great urban myths yet except for a fictionalized 1940s curio Earhart never got the big-screen treatment (there have also been two minor TV movies). Swank is the reason for this lavish one; the twice-Oscared Best Actress (one more than Meryl Streep FYI) executive-produced perhaps to grab her own destiny a la Amelia and avoid more embarrassments like ""The Core"" and ""The Reaping."" Her performance however is tragically waxen. Earhart exists as if in a museum tableau with Swank sketching out the rough-hewn Kansan who charmed the world in newsreels and radio interviews. Theres no soul under that aviator garb. Even her death scene is fumbled.Geres stateliness is wasted as Putnam is just a pouter or promoter and the glazed-looking McGregor is stuck with dialogue like ""Youve earned the spotlight enjoy it"" Certainly Earhart earned a better film. jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

ABOUT THE MOVIEAmelia   1/2 out of four Stars Hilary Swank Richard Gere Ewan McGregor Christopher Eccleston Cherry JonesDirector Mira NairDistributor 20th Century FoxRating PG for some sensuality language thematic elements and smokingRunning time 1 hour 51 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Amelia goes airborne but never fully soars. Its hampered by a too-reverential portrait of the record-breaking aviator. Hilary Swank is a plucky Amelia Earhart the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic and director Mira Nair has fashioned a sweeping and handsome film. VIDEO Watch a clip But it falls short of Nairs best work The Namesake or Monsoon Wedding and also Swanks most evocative portrayals in Boys Dont Cry and Million Dollar Baby. Amelias narrative adheres to the standard biopic formula. It limits its focus to about a decade during which Earhart takes her first trans-Atlantic flight as a passenger/commander in 1928 to her disappearance in 1937. She is an intrinsically fascinating subject but we dont get a sense of what propelled her to such courageous heights. Familiar platitudes headline montages and voice-over pontificating bog down the story in superficiality. Theres a seminal moment in Earharts Kansas childhood when she was enraptured by the sight of a small plane flying overhead. ""I had to fly"" she remembers thinking. But beyond that the sources of her passion and determination go unexplored. Her father was a man with wanderlust. Did he encourage her? Or was she inspired by a mother who was the first woman to summit Pikes Peak a point that goes oddly unmentioned in the movie but is cited in the production notes. Earharts can-do attitude no doubt served her well. But to be moved the audience needs more from her than a chipper smile and a jaunty wave. She is thoughtful enough to write ""popping-off letters"" to her family -- written goodbyes in case she doesnt survive a flight. With a confident grin she hands these missives to publisher George Putnam (Richard Gere) a man with a strong sense of public relations whom she later marries. Nothing unsettles her not even when her husband stumbles on a different kind of letter Earhart wrote to another man aeronautics instructor Gene Vidal (Ewan McGregor). What is conveyed with brio is Earharts non-traditional sensibility. Though not exactly a free spirit she was a thoroughgoing feminist well before the word became part of the lexicon. When Putnam proposes to her she makes it clear she wont hold him -- nor should he her -- to any old-fashioned notions of fidelity. But she is so open-hearted and likable that she never comes across selfish or dishonorable. She lives by her own principles and offers a spunky role model for women and young girls as well as a beacon of hope to a country hammered by the Great Depression. ""I fly for the fun"" she tells a crowd gathered. Though it is fun watching Swank relish her highflying adventure its too bad that a film about a daring and audacious woman taking on staggering challenges plays it so safe.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor October 23 2009 Save for later Saved This photo released by Fox Searchlight shows Hilary Swank as Amelia Earhart and Richard Gere as George Putnam in a scene from ""Amelia."" Fox SearchlightKen Woroner/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of ""Amelia"" is an old-fashioned biopic that doesnt jibe with a newfangled world. Director Mira Nairs devotional take on legendary aviatrix Amelia Earhart played by Hilary Swank is almost completely lacking in edge irony humor sparks. Its the movie equivalent of a mediocre young-adult novel about a famous historical personage.Even discounting all the conspiracy theories surrounding Earharts midflight disappearance in the South Pacific in 1937 her life is far more interesting than this movie allows for. She is presented to us as a rambunctious Kansas girl who always dreamed of flying and rose to Lindbergh-like celebrity when she eventually became the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. Her fate unfolds seemingly magically - shes destined to soar the skies. (About the only transcendent thing in the movie are the cloud-borne aerial shots.)Swank is a dead ringer for Earhart which only makes the movies deficiencies even more regrettable. Its impossible not to imagine how much better her performance might have been if the movie had been equal to her look. But Swank freckled with close-cropped hair sporting an iffy Midwestern accent is done in by Nairs reverential treatment. In particular shes done in by the script (by Ron Bass and Anna Hamilton Phelan based on two mammoth Earhart biographies) which force-feeds her such lines as ""I want to be free to be a vagabond of the air"" or my favorite ""What do dreams know of boundaries?"" Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Among the many boundaries in ""Amelia"" is the insipid romance between Earhart and her publicist-husband George Putnam played by Richard Gere with an old pro gravitas that doesnt do him any favors. Putnam who published Lindberghs autobiography and helped turn Earhart into a media sensation is such a lap dog for love that you keep waiting for something horrible to happen to him. Maybe hell turn into the Wolfman? But no hes an ideal hubby all the way through (even though the marriage in real life was rockier). Even a purported affair between Earhart and aeronautics pioneer Gene Vidal (Ewan McGregor) is so toned-down as to be nonexistent. Its kissypoo erotics. (Yes Gene Vidal was the father of Gore who is well played as a young boy by William Cuddy.) Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? The portrayal of Putnam fits right in with the films overall tone of groggy uplift. Whenever Nair has to fill us in on Earharts rise to fame she inserts documentary montages newspaper headlines - all the paraphernalia of old-time movie-making. Why make a modern movie in this way? Nair isnt trying to comment on the times by being deliberately antiquated. Instead she seems to be willing herself back in time to the good old days when American idols were portrayed as unblemished heroes.But weve grown up from those so-called good old days and our movies along with us. For most of us thats a good thing. But perhaps Nair believes that heroism in our tabloid era has become degraded. If so she overcorrected. ""Amelia"" is so pure in heart that it slides right off the screen. Grade C- (Rated PG for some sensuality language thematic elements and smoking.)

In her place ""Amelia"" presents a protofeminist with a frozen smile spouting free-as-a-bird slogans from a bird-brained script. The film struggles to stay aloft and may soon vanish like its namesake without a trace. But below and beyond the mystery of Earharts fate ""Amelia"" leaves you wondering how its abundantly gifted director Mira Nair and its Oscar-winning star Hilary Swank could have been complicit in such clumsiness. Its the age-old question of why bad movies happen to good people. ENLARGE Fox Searchlight In this case the answer starts with the subject matter which gives off the musty odor of old news. By now everyone has heard of the dashing aviatrix of the 1930s and everyone knows if only vaguely how her story ends. (She and her navigator disappeared over the Pacific during an attempted round-the-world flight; no trace of them has ever been found.) Still her story remains an intriguing one. What caused the tragedy? Who was the real woman behind the smile the rakish goggles and the publicity campaigns that marketed her to an adoring public? The movie offers no new or interesting theories on the first count; it shows her Lockheed Electra simply running out of fuel because of navigational problems and a communications failure. And the screenplay takes a reverential view of her celebrity barely allowing for the possibility that she like her scholarly contemporary Margaret Mead was eager to be celebrated. (The writers of record are Ron Bass who has come to be known for formulaic screenplays--""Stepmom"" ""Entrapment""--cranked out by him and his associates in a kind of atelier and Anna Hamilton Phelan.) This Amelia wants only to fly. ""I want to be free George a vagabond of the air"" she tells the publisher George Putnam who becomes her business partner and later her domineering though loving husband. Hes played by Richard Gere who gets no more sustenance from the script than Ms. Swank does. George is the smirk to Amelias smile the victimizer to her victim the ambitious entrepreneur pushing her toward profitable if sometimes fraudulent adventures in the name of American capitalism. During one of those adventures a solo flight across the North Atlantic she gushes voice-over ""It was a night of stars of tropic loveliness""; the vagabond script cant even keep its climate zones straight. Amelias final flight provides the only source of drama--of quasidrama since the outcome is never in doubt--but its chopped up into short episodes and intercut intrusively with the episodic evolution of her public and personal life. With material like this whats a director to do? And not just any director but the woman recently responsible for a wonderful film called ""The Namesake"" and before it the richly textured canvas of ""Salaam Bombay"" (During the course of that final flight Amelia and her remarkably dislikable navigator Fred Noonan make a refueling stop in Calcutta which is as richly textured as a pasteboard background in a 1930s B movie.) ENLARGE Hilary Swank as the title aviator in Mira Nairs Amelia. Fox Searchlight Those were Indian films though produced mostly on Ms. Nairs home turf. Given the nature of this one a star vehicle with an American theme she may well have been compelled to shoot the script as it was written. The best shes been able to do is bring some spontaneity to certain stretches of the stolid proceedings a few bright exchanges between Amelia and George once hes come around to seeing her as a human being instead of a viable product; a gentle moment between Amelia and her lovers young son. (The real-life lover Gene Vidal is played by Ewan McGregor; Genes son is none other than the preteen Gore Vidal.) Ms. Swank for her part tries to inhabit a role with no living quarters. The writing is all about externals--what Amelia says rather than what she feels what she looks like (glamorous though she says she wears pants because she doesnt like her legs and feminine though theres one fleeting hint of more complex sexuality). Even the flying is about externals. Apart from admiring her new Electra and pushing an occasional throttle the most famous female pilot in history displays no particular affinity for the gorgeous machinery at her disposal. The whole movie is a failure to communicate. ENLARGE Charlotte Gainsbourg as She and Willem Dafoe as He in Lars von Triers Antichrist. IFC Films Antichrist Opening ""Antichrist"" this close to Halloween does Lars von Triers latest film a disservice. This isnt a pretend horror flick with violence you can shrug off or laugh off. Its the real thing and Ill try to do the service of emphasizing--without specifying so read on--the intensity of the horror which begins as a couples emotional burden after the death of their child and the extent of the violence which is sexual psychosexual symbolic graphic pornographic misogynistic (though also mutual as well as self-inflicted) and deeply deeply disturbing. Its a two-character piece unless you count a talking fox. The husband an emotionally remote therapist is played by Willem Dafoe. The wife a writer working on a book called ""Gynocide"" is played by Charlotte Gainsbourg. Most of the action takes place in or near a cabin in the woods where the couple has gone in search of spiritual peace. To say they dont find it is the understatement of the movie year. More on Antichrist Sex Guilt and a Talking Fox Young genre-film fans champion von Triers arty Antichrist My first--and then frequent--instinct was the emotional equivalent of duck-and-cover I didnt want to deal with the couples shared madness the movies provocative looniness or Mr. von Triers bleak notions about the ties that bind us one to another to religious belief and to a Mother Nature that he depicts as calmly and implacably malign. But both actors have given themselves over to the filmmakers vision with performances that had me feeling like Malcolm McDowell in ""A Clockwork Orange"" horrified yet unable to look away. And Anthony Dod Mantle the cinematographer who shot ""Slumdog Millionaire"" has created a succession of somber images (in delicately controlled black-and-white) that refuse to loosen their grip on my memory. By turns repellent powerful and ludicrous ""Antichrist"" piles horror on horror with pitiless passion. Ong Bak 2 Four years ago a movie called ""Ong-Bak The Thai Warrior"" introduced American audiences to Tony Jaa a martial-arts star famous for doing his phenomenal stunts without doubles or wires. He played Ting a country bumpkin who journeys to violence-ridden Bangkok to retrieve a Buddhas head thats been stolen from his village by urban thugs. Now Mr. Jaa is both the star and co-director of ""Ong Bak 2"" an action extravaganza that sheds the original titles hyphen centers on a well-born protagonist named Tien and drops him into a superviolent 15th-century Thailand that turns him into a thief and makes contemporary Bangkok look like an Amish hamlet. As odd an actor as ever Mr. Jaa still acts from his limbs and torso rather than from his head or face. This time his artistry also includes dance (yes every martial artist thinks hes a Fight Club Fred Astaire but Tien really has some elegant moves) and the cast includes an impressive herd of elephants. Unfortunately the movie could use a bit of pachyderm memory given its habit of flashing back to Tiens childhood with exactly the same footage used in previous flashbacks. Instead of the narrative being deepened it keeps getting shallowed. DVD FOCUS Monsoon Wedding (2001) ENLARGE ""Just Because India has gone global should we embrace everything?"" asks a TV talking head in New Delhi. Maybe not but thats exactly what Mira Nair manages to do with her comical and at one point startling film about an upwardly mobile Punjabi family. The production defies description what with marigolds in profusion peacocks that botch a weather forecast broad burlesque sexy dances worthy of Bollywood extravaganzas at their goofiest and at the end of the ceremonial road a white stallion draped in paste jewelry. The movie far from being paste is a string of small exquisite gems. Boys Dont Cry (1999) ENLARGE Before Hilary Swank won an Oscar for her work as a boxer in ""Million Dollar Baby"" she won one for her performance as Teena Brandon a frightened and fearless young woman--no contradiction as it turns out--who suffering from a disturbance of sexual identity is trying to pass in rural Nebraska as a young man named Brandon Teena. This debut feature directed by Kimberly Peirce from an original screenplay that she wrote with Andy Bienen creates an exterior world thats as solid and specific--and menacing--as Teena/Brandons interior world is chaotic and vague. Unfaithful (2002) ENLARGE This erotic thriller was directed by Adrian Lyne (from a script by Alvin Sargent and William Broyles Jr.) and stars Richard Gere and Diane Lane as Edward and Connie Sumner an apparently happy couple living with their eight-year-old son in suburbia; Olivier Martinez plays Paul a young urban stranger who comes between them. The film is Ms. Lanes from start to finish; she gives a sensationally fine performance. Still Mr. Gere makes Edward very charming then very dangerous as the drama darkens; its strong mature work by a star who rarely gets to test the full range of his abilities.

"Amelia | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; amelia ) Amelia (United States 2009) October 22 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Mira Nairs Amelia is a by-the-book bio-pic. By following the template its as safe and straightforward as one could possibly get without narrative flourishes and with minimal exaggeration to satisfy Hollywoods appetite for fictionalization. Thats not bad but its not necessarily good either. Amelia Earhart led an active and interesting enough life that a simple re-telling of events works to a degree. It helps that Hilary Swank looks and acts the part and that Nairs style never gets in the way of the story. While this may not be the definitive Earhart biography Amelia is watchable. Earhart who was born in 1897 was the first aviatrix to make a solo flight across the Atlantic. Her enduring fame which continues more than 70 years after her presumed death has more to do with the mystery of her disappearance than with the accomplishments of her life. In 1937 Earhart (played in the film by Hilary Swank) and navigator Fred Noonan (Christopher Eccleston) attempted to circumnavigate the globe in an airplane. During the final leg of the journey as they were approaching a Pacific Ocean refueling stop on the small Howland Island they vanished never to be heard from again. The mystery of Earharts fate became a popular topic of discussion and supposition for decades. Even today there is no certain answer to the question of what befell her and Noonan. Nairs film starts in June 1937 with Earhart already on her way around the world. The bulk of the story is told in flashback. We meet Amelia before she was famous when she is selected by publisher George Putnam (Richard Gere) who would later become her husband to be a passenger on a transatlantic flight piloted by a seasoned veteran. This gave her fame and she used that fame to feed her flying habit - an obsession that culminated in 1932 with the solo flight. She became an influential role model for girls befriended First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt (Cherry Jones) and had an affair with the influential Gene (father of Gore) Vidal (Ewan McGregor) before reuniting with Putnam and planning her greatest challenge flying around the world. The flashback approach is awkward and adds nothing that couldnt have been accomplished more elegantly via a standard chronological telling. When theres a purpose a non-linear structure can be useful but theres no compelling reason for it here so its a little distracting. The story is reasonably faithful to the historical record and provides some useful insights into aspects of Earharts life that are not found in most high school history books (she was a popular spokesperson for everything from Lucky Strikes cigarettes to Amelia Earhart luggage she was unfaithful to her husband). The tone is a little sluggish however and the ""action"" sequences (such as when she encounters a storm over the Atlantic) are not smoothly choreographed. One needs to have more than a passing interest in the aviatrix to remain interested through some of the drier chapters of her life. Amelia doesnt whitewash Earhart; it carefully avoids lionization. She is shown to be reckless (despite her arguments to the contrary) self-centered and obsessed. In fact if anyone comes across as worthy of canonization its George Putnam who accepts her as she is agrees to marry on her terms supports her potentially suicidal endeavors and takes her back after she has an affair with another man. Richard Gere is fine as the bland publisher; he shows charisma but not of the romantic kind (to be frank he reminded me of my maternal grandfather). Hilary Swank bears an eerie physical resemblance to Earhart (so much so that the archival photographs at the end could almost be of her and not the real Amelia) and gives a credible performance although not one likely to attract Oscar attention. Both Ewan McGregor and Christopher Eccleston are underused. Thats especially disappointing in Ecclestons case because Noonan seems to be a more interesting character than the title one. (Although its doubtful a film called Fred could have been greenlighted.) The problem with a film like this is that it leaves no lasting impression. Its workmanlike but lacks passion. The story is more like a chronicle of history than an attempt to make it come to life. I never cared much about Earhart and her romance with Putnam strikes as many sparks as wet matches on a damp night. The ending provides closure to Amelias life without offering a definitive conclusion (although one alternative is preferred by the screenwriters). All-in-all its a perfectly adequate motion picture. Unfortunately although I was diverted for the length of its running I expect more from a movie especially one directed by a filmmaker as talented as Nair (whose previous feature was the powerful The Namesake). This movie was made to be shown to junior high history classes not audiences in a movie theater.

Comments click to enlarge Amelia 2009 With any luck this biopic of Amelia Earhart will also vanish without a trace. Hilary Swank is sorely miscast as the legendary aviator who disappeared during a flight over the Pacific in 1937 and stiff-necked performances from Richard Gere (as George Putnam Earharts devoted husband and manager) and Ewan McGregor (as Gore Vidals father Gene a civil aviation official for the Roosevelt administration who was supposedly Earharts lover) dont help. Adapted from biographies by Susan Butler and Mary S. Lovell the script uses Earharts doomed last flight as a narrative frame but the main ingredients are the soggy love triangle and some half-hearted feminist uplift. Mira Nair (The Namesake) directed.

But Mira Nairs affectionate biographical drama doesnt take nearly as many risks as its heroine did. Ken Woroner/Fox Searchlight hide caption toggle caption Ken Woroner/Fox Searchlight Amelia Director Mira NairGenre Historical DramaRunning Time 120 minutes Rated PG With Hilary Swank Ewan McGregor Richard Gere Watch Clips Anywhere You Are I Was Aiming For Paris If You Miss That Island So what do you think -- a plane flying into clouds and simply disappearing? Plane flying ever closer to water as camera pulls back to show miles of ocean in all directions? Close-up of tight-lipped aviator peering intently as the engine sputters? Shot of bronze commemorative statue with birth and death dates? Which moviemaking cliche(s) do you suppose Mira Nair has chosen for the foregone conclusion of Amelia her handsome but stubbornly by-the-numbers hagiography of boundary-pushing pilot Amelia Earhart? Ill not spoil the suspense as the directors choice for the final scene is virtually the only question this inert biopic manages to keep up in the air for any length of time. The rest of the story is so earthbound and predictable that youll find yourself muttering the lines right along with Earhart (Hilary Swank) and Richard Putnam (Richard Gere) her husband and chief promoter. Seriously The peripatetic Putnam tells Earhart on the eve of her disappearance that hes going to take her home after this one last flight and she wonders where ""home"" is. Say hubbys reply with me now ""For me anywhere you are."" Is there another answer that would justify the questions even being in the script? Putnam was the publisher who made a fortune promoting Lucky Lindys solo flight across the Atlantic and when Earhart responds to an ad recruiting a female pilot to make the same flight (albeit as a passenger) its clear hes hoping lightning will strike twice. Earhart proves more ambitious than he anticipated -- she would later repeat that Atlantic crossing this time as pilot -- and after a while by screenwriters fiat rather than any evident onscreen passion Putnam falls in love with her. As does she reluctantly with him. She does insist on a prenup stating that they wont expect exclusivity which allows her a later equally desultory fling with Gene Vidal (Ewan McGregor) father of a future writer -- as were told again and again when Earhart asks after young Gore. i Nairs film plays up Earharts iconoclastic impulses -- even asserting a much-disputed affair with Gene Vidal (Ewan McGregor) head of an FAA predecessor known as the Bureau of Air Commerce. Ken Woroner/Fox Searchlight hide caption toggle caption Ken Woroner/Fox Searchlight Nairs film plays up Earharts iconoclastic impulses -- even asserting a much-disputed affair with Gene Vidal (Ewan McGregor) head of an FAA predecessor known as the Bureau of Air Commerce. Ken Woroner/Fox Searchlight That open-relationship business helps establish Earharts suffragist-era feminist cred though the mere fact of her flying -- in an age when women were expected to excel only in stenography and similarly earthly pursuits -- does some of that too. In any event her rebellious impulses would prove more useful if the screenwriters could figure out what to do with them in a script old-fashioned enough to have been written the year her plane disappeared. Production values are fine -- from shiny planes gleaming on tarmacs to rhapsodic flying sequences to snazzy 20s outfits for the star. Swank inhabits her wardrobe more persuasively than she does an on-again off-again Midwestern accent -- or indeed the character herself. Everyone concerned seems to have thought it sufficient that Swank physically resembles Earhart so closely that the filmmakers could use newsreel footage at one point rather than shooting a new scene. But the result is verisimilitude without engagement -- a risk-takers story told entirely without narrative risk -- and a movie that consequently never takes flight.

""Amelia"" Movie Review -- ""Of course"" one critic complained after an early screening of ""Amelia"" ""they left out how she was executed by the Japanese."" Except they really didnt leave that out since theres no proof that it ever happened. ""Why didnt they address her bisexuality?"" someone else grumbled. ""Was it because they just had to have that PG rating?"" Or was it maybe that theres no proof that Amelia Earhart was bisexual? Amelia (PG) Fox Searchlight (111 min.) Directed by Mira Nair. With Hilary Swank Richard Gere. Now playing in New Jersey. STEPHEN WHITTYS RATING TWO STARS Rating note The film contains mild sensuality. But thats one of the things about legends. They begin their iconic life as a symbol for one thing; they end it as a symbol for whatever the interpreter wants. Who was Amelia Earhart really? Its a good question. Unfortunately its one beyond ""Amelia."" The film is directed by Mira Nair a hit-or-miss filmmaker whos been at her best with forceful heroines (""Mississippi Masala"" ""Monsoon Wedding."") The screenwriting credits go to Anna Hamilton Phelan and Ron Bass -- specialists in respectively stories about dedicated women and sensitive femme-oriented melodramas. Oh and the star is Hilary Swank a smart actress whose mix of heartland gaucherie bruised vulnerability and tomboyish enthusiasm has already won her two Oscars (and who by happenstance bears a slight resemblance to the real Earhart). So -- cleared for takeoff right? Not really. The film cant seem to plot a course toward the truth of its own subject. Earhart it tells us had freckles prized her independence and liked to fly -- until one day in 1937 when the plane in which she was circling the globe suddenly disappeared at sea. Thats a sad story. But its not really a dramatic one. There are hints of another more interesting movie in here -- exploring perhaps the idea that Earhart was modern medias first creation more skilled at publicity (she was a whiz at lucrative endorsements) than truly talented (contemporary aviators didnt rate her very highly). That story would not only have relevance to our celebrity-saturated age but it would be a true tragedy -- the story of someone brought down not by bad luck or weather but by her own hubris. But it wouldnt be very heroic or the sort of hagiography in which this film wants to indulge. And so were back to dull bland heroine-worship as plucky Amelia goes from triumph to triumph. Until she doesnt. Swank brings all her usual strengths to the role and Richard Gere does what he can with the part of the long-suffering and occasionally cheated-upon spouse. (Its a gender switch on the usual cliche but no more interesting.) The period clothes and cinematography are lovely. Yet we end the film knowing no more about Earhart than we did at the beginning. Perhaps there was something opaque about Earhart all along. Perhaps thats why so many theories sprung up about her especially in the wake of her disappearance. (Among the most outrageous She survived to make anti-American propaganda broadcasts from wartime Japan -- or alternately she changed her name and moved to New Jersey). But at least the crackpots who cooked those up had theories however unlikely. At least they had some sort of idea. ""Amelia"" just has the image of a lanky woman with short hair and a toothy grin climbing into her cockpit and disappearing into the clouds -- and never revealing anything at all.

Earhart was the first woman to fly the Atlantic solo and personified the ""New Woman.""By Carrie Rickey Inquirer Movie CriticPosted October 23 2009In The Aviator Martin Scorsese mythologized Howard Hughes as a 20th-century Icarus who scorched by the sun plummeted to earth. In Amelia director Mira Nair presents Amelia Earhart legendary aviatrix as a female Odysseus who navigates uncharted territory while a patient spouse knits his brow until she returns.Though this traditional story about a defiantly nontraditional woman doesnt always soar it fits Hilary Swank its producer/star like a jumpsuit. She and Nair thrill to the life of this American who broke records hearts and boundaries.Earhart (1897-1937) first took to the skies in 1920 in a plane that didnt have a gas gauge brakes or rear wheels. While the story of her fearless Kansas youth and vagabonding teen years may have added another dimension to her character the film - written by Ron Bass (Rain Man) and Anna Hamilton Phelan (Girl Interrupted) - races past her first 30 years.It begins in 1937 then flashes back to the pivotal year of 1928 when promoter and publishing magnate George Putnam (Richard Gere) auditioned the 30-year-old flier for the role of first female to fly the Atlantic.Like an ingenue Earhart got her break when Putnam who knew the value of novelty when it came to selling books or cigarettes essentially cast her as the first woman to cross the Atlantic by plane.In 1928 she took a backseat to male copilots. But soon Earhart took the controls as the first woman to fly the Atlantic solo and first aviator to twice fly the transatlantic route. The public embraced her as it had Charles Lindberg. The media crowned the striking aviatrix ""Lady Lindy.""Nairs biopic focuses on Earharts momentous last decade one of dizzying motion. Whether setting records in the air hopping between cities on lecture tours that financed her exploits or pursuing her hearts desire she personified what was called the New Woman. Matter-of-factly the film presents Earhart as one who resisted gravity and societys expectations.Swanks wide-set eyes toothy smile and slim-hipped stride lend her an extraordinary resemblance to the aviatrix of period newsreels.But Swank is no mere impersonator. Her Amelia like Maggie in Million Dollar Baby is unwavering in her gaze ambition and drive. Swank streamlines Earhart into a figure who stands taller and flies higher than her confreres. In Nairs evocatively art-directed (and sensationally costumed) film Earhart comes alive.Gere is sly as Putnam playing him so that when he beholds his protegee we cant tell if those are hearts or dollar signs glittering in his eyes.Amelia pointedly details how the promoter turned the aviatrix into one of the first media stars to earn money from product endorsements.Although she resisted Putnams initial marriage proposals Earhart reluctantly wed him - handing him a prenup agreement before the ceremony. She refused to hold him to ""any medieval code of faithfulness"" expected to enjoy her own freedoms and made him promise that if the marriage didnt work out after a year he would let her go.Earhart did enjoy her own freedoms. Whether taking off across new horizons stumping for female employment in the new field of aviation or pursuing an affair with Gene Vidal (Ewan McGregor) the aviator father of writer Gore Vidal she wrote her own agenda fearlessly.While the movie is more about the love affair between woman and plane Earhart came to love Putnam nicely played by Gere as the wind beneath her wings.A filmmaker who customarily explores interior landscapes Nair (Monsoon Wedding The Namesake) exhilarates in Earharts perspective both scenic and existential. Whether looking out on frolicking giraffes or beyond the horizon Earhart still inspires.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickey phillynews.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The opening credits note that Amelia Mira Nairs portrait of femme flier Amelia Earhart is based on two separate biographies but the filmmakers could have saved time and money by merely cribbing from Earharts Wikipedia page since the movie never moves beyond the superficial facts of her life. Screenwriters Ron Bass and Anna Hamilton Phelan skim through Earharts history like a college student cramming for a test focusing on the years between her first transatlantic flight in 1928 and her disappearance while attempting to circumnavigate the globe in 1937. Her hair cropped her skin freckled and her voice compressed to a nasal Hepburn drawl Hilary Swank bears a remarkable resemblance to the woman shes playing but the impersonation is glib and glancing. Shes so constrained by mannerisms that she never gets beyond the characters surface--although to be fair trying to import feeling into the movies stilted dialogue is like trying to fly a plane blindfolded. That holds even truer for Richard Geres turn as Earharts promoter and eventual husband George Putnam. Never the most technically accomplished actor Gere is helpless when confronted with mock-classical lines like ""Only you my dear Amelia could say those brutal words to me."" Brutal indeed. If Amelia has any value (which is a dubious proposition) its as an object lesson in the follies of the conventional biopic which puts mindless recapitulation of historical data above analysis or insight. The messy fascination of life is replaced by a schematic series of setups and payoffs. The second its mentioned that Christopher Ecclestons navigator is a recovering alcoholic its clear that its only a matter of time before he falls off the wagon at a pivotal moment. His lived-in performance is one of the films only bright spots though along with Cherry Jones fleeting turn as an impish Eleanor Roosevelt. Although capably filmed by cinematographer Stuart Dryburgh the movie lacks any hint of the visual flair common to Nairs best work. (Criterions sparkling new edition of Monsoon Wedding makes for an apt and damning comparison.) It isnt so much hard to believe that Nair directed Amelia as its hard to believe it was directed at all. Considering its focus on a pioneering rule-breaking icon the films utter lack of personality isnt just a failure. Its close to an insult.

Drawn from two Earhart bios Mira Nairs dull hagiography comes in about 111 minutes too long. Swanks Earhart is all grinning can-do at fault for nothing her only conflicts coming through the misunderstanding of a chauvinist materialist society unprepared for her barnstorming beauty. Beyond her record flights the film covers Earharts courtship with and marriage to publicist G.P. Putnam (Richard Gere) an architect of the Lindbergh legend and her free-love affair with Gores dad Gene Vidal (Ewan McGregor). Amelia is pinned uncomfortably between ""chase your dreams"" PG-safe and aspirations of sophistication. For a woman to write as we see Earhart doing a prenuptial condition that ""I shall not hold you to any medieval code of faithfulness to me nor shall I consider myself bound to you"" would be gutsy in 2009 not to mention mere years after suffrage theres little sense of the emotional risk Earharts taking with that declaration and the resulting menage a trois lacks heat. Period details from 1928 to 1937 are so cliched that someone might as well announce onscreen ""Gosh these 20s certainly are Roaring"" (Citywide) (Nick Pinkerton) A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - AS SEEN THROUGH THESE EYES Its an angle many Hitler historians cant leave alone As a young aspiring painter the fuhrer was rejected by the Vienna Art Institute; as a murderous dictator he remained an art lover looting Europe of its greatest treasures. The facts are there yet their melodramatic invocation does more harm than good to As Seen Through These Eyes a documentary about the creative impulse that sustained many young prisoners of World War II concentration camps. Distractingly tortured metaphors are given a distractingly affected narration by Maya Angelou the embittered Hitler ""refocused his passion for painting into a new art form"" and soon ""no one was safe from his sweeping paintbrush of death and destruction."" Inside this hackneyed frame are the actual subjects of the documentary many of whom are Auschwitz survivors who discuss their experiences and display their powerful wartime drawings and paintings. It must be tough being the worlds 7000th Holocaust documentary; there arent a lot of fresh angles left and recorded Holocaust images -- occasionally used here without identifying context as if they were interchangeable -- have become so codified that one wonders if that interchangeability is the ultimate sacrilege. But the artwork -- the product of individual experience and expression rather than an anonymous camera -- returns the horror of the camps to its proper piercing register. (Music Hall; Town Center 5) (Michelle Orange)ASTRO BOY Is it impossible to bottle childhood nostalgia in a movie? On the heels of Where the Wild Things Are comes Astro Boy a CGI-animated origin story for the legendary cartoon hero of the same name who first appeared in Osamu Tezukas 1951 futuro-Pinocchio manga comic. Westernized and sterilized the still-nippleless rocket-thrusting robo-kid now wears pants flies without his classic theme song and all but ignores his cult following to focus on merchandising to next-gen kiddies. But the fable stays intact After smarty-pants schoolboy Toby (voiced by Freddie Highmore) -- son of the genius Dr. Tenma (Nicolas Cage) -- is accidentally killed while presenting an experiment to the villainous General Stone (Donald Sutherland) Daddy builds a tricked-out android version made from his sons memories. But Astro is not Toby and so ends up treated like the robotic servants who wait on humans hand and wheel throughout this shiny metropolis hovering in the sky. Further class struggles erupt on the discarded Earth surface where junkyard urchins wave their fists up at those metro types and Astro ends up fighting baddies in both realms while looking for a family to call his own. Corny but goodhearted the film tries hard not to annoy parents with animation more fizzy than frantic and nerdy references to Asimovs law of robotics Kant and Freaks ""One of us one of us"" (Citywide) (Aaron Hillis)THE CANYON Another one for the bad-stuff-happens-to-stupid-people file The Canyon might at least offer the satisfaction of a few squirmy thrills if it werent so insistent on treating its central couples plight as the stuff of high tragedy. When newlyweds Nick (Eion Bailey) and Lori (Yvonne Strahovski) find their dream of riding mules through the Grand Canyon thwarted by local prohibitions they enlist the weird grizzled dude they meet at the bar to serve as their guide. But after leading them far off the beaten path Henry (Will Patton) falls prey to a snakebite and offering up a lame warning about nature taking its revenge on mankind dies leaving the two to fend for themselves. As they become progressively more lost the blandly handsome young couple find that the blandly handsome Arizona wilderness -- filmed by director Richard Harrah with picture-post card banality -- isnt as bland (or as handsome) as it seems. But despite the obvious dangers -- and a gruesome amputation -- the film goes light on action and suspense alike so that most of its running time is spent focused on two dullards spouting inane dialogue or doing dumb shit like trying to make cell-phone calls while climbing a massive crag.

Sep. 13 600pm CIRQUE DU FREAK THE VAMPIRES ASSISTANT The vampire trend continues but the only authentic bloodsuckers in Cirque du Freak are its producers and studio execs. Drawn from the young-adult books by U.K. author Darren Shan Cirque du Freak has F/X creatures teen angst and romance mysterious back stories and a brewing war between beasties. On paper its a perfect formula -- Twilight meets X-Men meets Harry Potter -- but the onscreen result is not the sum of its parts. Cirque du Freak opens in sunny suburbia where bland high-schooler Darren (Chris Massoglia) hangs out with his neer-do-well buddy Steve (Josh Hutcherson). Something wacky this way comes The titular freak show is in town for one night only. The two sneak out to meet the freaks including sardonic spider-tamer Larten (John C. Reilly) whom Steve recognizes from one of his occult books to be a 220-year-old vampire. Soon enough Darren becomes a half-vampire (?) whose new love interest -- a cute girl too insecure to show her monkey tail -- teaches him that ""being human is not about what you are but who you are""; Darren battles the now-evil Steve who is also now-jealous because Darren got to become a vampire; and Willem Dafoe shows up looking like Vincent Price resurrected. Some of you are thinking That sounds rad And Cirque might have worked if it were either straight dark comedy or actually dark like its source material. Directed by Paul Weitz (American Pie) the movie suffers from the same tonal schizophrenia of that other recent goth wannabe Jennifers Body Is it meant to be scary or funny? Oops its neither. (Citywide) (Aaron Hillis)HANNAH FREE In perhaps her biggest role since her work on the iconic 1980s cop show Cagney amp; Lacey Sharon Gless stars as Hannah an elderly woman denied permission to visit her dying lover Rachel (Maureen Gallagher) even though theyre residents of the same nursing home. Hannah and Rachel have been in love for 40 years even during Rachels marriage to a man. In flashbacks Hannah recalls their life together which it must be said isnt terribly interesting. Adapting her play screenwriter Claudia Allen presents each woman in the broadest of strokes -- Hannah is a free spirit obsessed with traveling the world while Rachel is homespun and responsible. Rather quickly the flashbacks become repetitively lovey-dovey; only near the end does Rachel in a fine moment for Gallagher let loose giving Hannah a piece of her mind and the film itself a much needed blast of energy. As directed by Wendy Jo Carlton Hannah Free is as predictable as a Hallmark Channel movie although theres undeniable pleasure to be had from watching Gless mumble and grumble and generally chew the scenery. Cagney lives and shes as cranky as ever. (Music Hall) (Chuck Wilson)THE JANKY PROMOTERS amp; FROM MEXICO WITH LOVE Two films opened unheralded last week at the Beverly Center--and may well be gone by the time you read this. That is whats called ""a contractual release."" It used to be that when a studio changed heads only those unlucky pictures that were produced under the previous regime would be given such a grim reaping a bare-bones ad campaign or none at all; a debut in some dimly lit plex sandwiched between extinct mammoths that once enjoyed the dignity of a fairly promoted first weekend. ""Straight to video"" used to mean forgettable martial arts stars or formerly viable actual stars whose careers were in turnaround or still-sexy ex-flavors of the month condemned to premature afterlives. These days however such bitter fates also greet filmmakers whose audiences are firmly established and wildcatter indies whose efforts in fairer times would at least be given a visible sendoff. Written by and starring Ice Cube and released (nominally) by The Weinstein Company The Janky Promoters is farce in the unpretentious vein of BarbershopBarbershop2FridayNext Fridayand Friday After Next. That is also its problem in hard Darwinian terms. Cube and Mike Epps play a pair of concert-promoting hustlers who in a single 24-hour period are repeatedly busted in their shameless lies by other shameless liars. Despite the music of Young Jeezy (playing himself) and the smoldering menace embodied by a local druglord (an outstanding Darris Love) everything builds to a fairly careless climax. In the theater across the hall FromMexicoWith Lovespins a more tightly constructed yarn from its equally familiar elements imposing the feel-good arc of Rocky (underdog-boxer-with-heart goes the distance against a privileged opponent) upon the gritty well-drawn texture of life among migrant workers along the border near Laredo Texas. Director Jimmy Nickerson was previously a distinguished stunt and fight coordinator (RockyGladiator Fight Club); the boxing here feels enjoyably lived in. Gummy bits of backstory may cling like Post-its to the undersides of the dialogue--we never lose sight that our hero (Kuno Becker excellent) is the son of a dead boxer who could have been one of the greats etc.--but the screenplay (by Glen Hartford and Nicholas Siapkaris) otherwise promotes reliable tension and lumps in ones throat. As villainous father to the spoiled gringo boxer Stephen Lang might easily have been a mere cipher of ill will but instead gives us a man who has painted himself into a corner psychologically--and so is more tormented and dangerous. Are movies as we know them dying that two such generic canaries as these should keel over in the cultural mineshaft? Both would pull you in if you caught them while channel-surfing--The Janky Promoters has good laughs (theres a welcome intrusion by the crew of the reality show Cheaters at one adulterous impasse); and whatever its surface predictabilities From Mexico With Love has the virtue of coaxing you to care about its people. Trouble is neither picture does anything new. Whatever large paradigm shift is transforming motion pictures here are two hapless proofs that economy be damned lack of originality is the silent killer. (F.X. Feeney) MOTHERHOOD Casting against type is one thing but putting Uma Thurman -- an unheralded character actress; the more extraordinary the character the better -- in the role of an unkempt New York City mom goes against the cinematic gods. And the gods are angry at Motherhood writer/director Katherine Dieckmanns ode to the trials of Manhattans downwardly mobile breeding bourgeoisie. Thurman in a scruffy brown wig and dingy housedress has been cursed with a mannered ""comic"" performance and that funky flutey elocution she uses when shes trying to speak like a real person. Thurman plays Eliza the mother of two young children and wife of a hapless editor (Anthony Edwards). Together they live the kind of shabby-groovy life -- ruled by preschool pickups and parking shenanigans -- familiar to half of Brooklyn. Dieckmann nails the look of a certain niche of urban neo-middle class living but the films hyperearnest tone and reliance on ""day-from-hell"" New York cliches overwhelm those details. Eliza formerly known for her ""fiercely lyrical fiction"" wants to win a mommy blog contest because ""nobody talks about this stuff."" Alas the deadline for the contest looms as several major dramas unfold including the organizing of a kiddie birthday party and Elizas swift bloggy betrayal of a fellow moms confidence about using her sons bath toy as a dildo. (Monica 4-Plex; Town Center 5; Playhouse 7) (Michelle Orange)ONG BAK 2 Youre not always entirely sure what is happening in Tony Jaas new movie but there certainly is a lot of it. In this in-name-only sequel the martial-arts maven plays Tien a scion avenging his family in a 15th-century Thailand marked by arcane hybrid fighting styles and a numbing sepia murkiness. Flying-fist connoisseurs may appreciate his journey from training with bandits to battling the warlords who killed his father but the crossover fans tickled by Ong Baks spark and humor will be disappointed here. While Jaa clearly hasnt lost any of his stamina in the six years since starring as a different underdog in the original his first outing as a director is confusing with distractingly muddy storytelling and wildly varying styles from scene to scene. Thrills do come from acrobatic antics with an alligator and on an obliging elephant; a kick fight conducted mostly on the ground; and an engaging assortment of pummeling in a multilevel thatched village. The movie would work better as a highlight reel. While the first Ong Bak replayed shots from a second angle here the gimmick is replaying in slo-mo -- which only calls attention to the films slog. (Sunset 5; Playhouse 7) (Nicolas Rapold)SAW VI If you havent followed the series up until now theres not much point in trying to catch up with the agonized convolutions of the Saw sagas plot line. Somebody tried to explain the plot of Saw III or IV to me once and it took a half-hour -- this film presumably like its predecessors is a bumblefuck involving a serial killer Jigsaw (a thin-lipped Tobin Bell now intoning from beyond the grave) who devises Fear Factor-/Pit and the Pendulum-style deadly dilemmas for his victims. Taken just as an objet dart Saw VI -- gray grisly solemn stupid -- would be about the most dismal thing Ive ever laid eyes on the argument against film preservation. But it vaults into the realm of real detestability through pretensions of relevance having Jigsaw go after faddish bad guys such as usurers made to cut their own pound of flesh and a team of insurance-company employees looking out for the bottom line. Yes Saw VI youre a vehicle for positive social action. Suggested plot for the inevitable Saw VII Jigsaw captures and tortures ""artists"" and studio execs who have money and access to a supple potentially transcendent and ennobling medium but instead make a lot of Saw movies. (Citywide) (Nick Pinkerton) STAN HELSING There is not a single frame of funny in Stan Helsing. A flaccid excruciatingly tedious spoof of contemporary horror films that according to press notes was ""written and directed by one of the guys who brought you Scary Movie"" (said guy is Bo Zenga) SH traffics in wan sight gags lethargic pacing and a plot that can be summed up as ""and then some other lame shit happens. ."" When quipping slacker video-store clerk of the title (Steve Howey) heads out for a night of Halloween partying with his best friend (Kenan Thompson) his ex-girlfriend and a stripper-turned-massage therapist little does he know that before the night is over he will discover he is descended from a legendary monster hunter -- which comes in handy as he and his motley crew do battle with a whos who of horror-flick baddies. What Zenga doesnt half-ass recycle (oh check out the wisecracking black folks talking shit to the video screen as white folks in a horror flick stumble into harms way) he simply fumbles. The generically attractive young cast gamely tries to pump life into the script to no avail. Leslie Nielsen in waitress drag however looks like hed rather be having a colonoscopy. (Mann Chinese 6) (Ernest Hardy)THE STEPFATHER Awkwardly chummy guys with weird glasses who disappear into darkened rooms with your laughing mother to listen to Donald Fagen solo albums -- the stepfather was a ready-to-villainize archetype for the kids-of-divorce who saw the 1987 Terry OQuinn thriller. That Stepfather was Donald Westlakes reworking of Hitchcocks wolf-in-the-suburbs Shadow of a Doubt and now Westlakes screenplay has been rejiggered. The kickoff is good -- the finale effectively literalizes the expression ""broken home"" -- but director Nelson McCormick doesnt keep things ""taut"" in between. Rather than do scenes right the first time he tends to deja vu them (this usually involves Amber Heard wearing not-too-much). Menaced family and friends include a Gossip Girl guy and a bunch of actors who look faintly like other more-famous actors but The Stepfather is finally only as good as its stepfather -- and Dylan Walsh aint bad. Hes nondescriptly handsome in a subdued strong-jaw line L.L. Bean-fashion shortish-as-bullies-will-be and oversensitive and overpolite in a hard-to-pinpoint way. Still comparison with Jaume Collet-Serras recent and superior Orphan -- also about a breached family -- shows the difference between a by-the-numbers journeyman and a serious student of genre. Anyhow closing on a butt-rock cover of ""Happy Together"" should leave em laughing. (Citywide) (Nick Pinkerton)(UNTITLED)(Untitled) aims wide and misses its satire of the contemporary-art scene seemingly lifted from the transcripts of late-80s Senate debates about the NEA. Two highly competitive brothers -- Josh (Eion Bailey) a successful painter of dull hotel art and Adrian (Adam Goldberg who also serves as executive producer) a perpetually indignant brow-furrowing composer of atonal music -- fall for wildly ambitious New York gallerist Madeleine (Marley Shelton). Director Jonathan Parker who co-wrote with Catherine DiNapoli (the duo behind 2001s Bartleby) wants to have it both ways snidely mocking his protagonists and then granting them happy art-affirming endings. Adrian scribbles furiously in his Moleskine Madeleine wears noisy textured clothing (though Sarah Lawrence tees are her preferred sleepwear) and crybaby Josh wonders ""When did beauty become so fuckin ugly?"" Tepid spoofs of Damien Hirst and Charles Ray creations fall flat as finger-wagging proof of contemporary arts aesthetic bankruptcy a Warholian-like aphasic thrown in for more laffs. (Untitled) tries to reignite who-gets-to-call-it-art debates that havent been taken seriously for at least a decade -- which may explain the recurring presence of a plastic bag that appears to have blown in off the set of American Beauty.(The Landmark; Sunset 5; Town Center 5; Playhouse 7) (Melissa Anderson) Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

The mystery we ought to be paying attention to is What really happened on the legendary American aviators final fatal flight in 1937? But the question audiences are left with is this How could so tradition-busting a role model have resulted in so square stiff and earthbound a movie? Why present such a modern woman in such a fusty format? Dressed for the title role in a wardrobe of jumpsuits leather jackets scarves and slinky evening wear dashing enough to stop air traffic Hilary Swanks Earhart doesnt so much talk as make stump speeches even ? when shes at her own breakfast table. ? And director Mira Nair (The Namesake) working from an overexplanatory script by Ron Bass and Anna Hamilton Phelan (based on dual biographies by Susan Butler and Mary S. Lovell) overloads the picture with a cargo of messages so much so that she deadens her subjects spirit. Some of these talking points are aimed at todays teenage girls who might admire the subjects highly personal fashion sense; others go out to older women who cherish her feminist cred. All of them add up to banners that might as well be flown from an aircraft tail over a beach Amelia Earhart lived free in life and love And Fly She Must Of course she did setting records as the first woman to fly across the Atlantic in 1928 (she was a passenger but still ladies of the day generally didnt wear leather helmets and zoom through the air). Earhart was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic in 1932. She went on to launch her own brand-name fashion line. In 1935 she became the first pilot to fly solo from Hawaii to ? California. Sometimes the press dubbed her Lady Lindy linking her fame to that of pioneering pilot Charles Lindbergh. Most famously she vanished (along with her navigator Fred Noonan) in the middle of the Pacific while on an around-the-world flight in 1937; her plane was never found and she was declared legally dead in 1939. Along the way the celebrity married George Putnam the publisher and tireless promoter who shaped her public image. (Richard Gere does the honors as Putnam with all the dated silver-head-in-hands poses required of him as a worried businessman/spouse whose wife is also his client.) For a time the freethinking woman also conducted a love affair with aeronautics pioneer Gene Vidal (Ewan McGregor) now best known as the father of writer Gore Vidal. Swank delivers long carefully composed explications of Earharts unorthodox attitude toward marriage and feminine autonomy taken from her journal entries in studied accents somewhere between those of the Kansas plains of Earharts birth and those of Katharine Hepburn in her most famous trouser-wearing gumption-gal roles. Amelia dutifully conveys the salient ? biographical info with a trusty cinematic device As Earhart and Noonan embark on their doomed flight flashbacks catch the audience up on the events that got her there. (Christopher Eccleston as Noonan is the one understated player in this endeavor.) Those last 10 minutes or so of radio-?communications loss concurrent instrument failure and dawning awareness of disaster are honestly gripping. But just in case the point isnt clear enough (She Must Fly) throughout the drama composer Gabriel Yared lays on blasts of musical exclamations that are as distracting as sirens. Sometimes that music says ""Its great to be in the sky and surfing the clouds"" Sometimes it says ""Look how pretty the landscape looks ? below -- kind of makes you miss the music in Out of Africa right?"" Sometimes the rumble of violins and horns hints ""Uh-oh were ? getting to the tragic part of the story"" Mostly the busy orchestra backs up the starry cinematography to remind us ""This slim androgynous beauty with her unusual love life and her driving need to take to the skies sure was something huh?"" Whatever the message theres no navigating around such intrusive messengers.

"Amelia Movie review of Amelia by Roger Moore - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Amelia -- 3 out of 5 stars Hilary Swank and Richard Gere Fox Searchlight Fox Searchlight Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Amelia has magnificent period settings and airplanes and majestic aerial photography. It boasts the two-time Oscar winner Hilary Swank perfectly cast as Amelia Earhart with Richard Gere as Earharts promoter-publisher husband George Putnam. They even have nice on-screen chemistry.But Mira Nairs big-screen Amelia is one thing the Earhart was not -- safe. Its sometimes moving and occasionally even thrilling and poetic. It never however truly takes flight. The film focuses on the public-era Earhart and the romantic Earhart. We meet her as shes interviewing for the ""job"" of being the first woman passenger on a still-dangerous transatlantic flight. She was already a pilot in 1928 -- one of the cute liberties the film takes is making her ""commander"" of that three-person ""Friendship"" voyage calling more shots about when theyd go than she probably did. Its still spine-tingling to see this ground-breaking woman ""take charge"" tempt fate create her own destiny in an era when women didnt do that.She was built for fame -- with Jazz Age flapper looks a media-friendly manner and a name ready-made for the kind of celebrity that followed. Nair frames the story within flashbacks various stages of Amelias final fateful round-the-world flight. In less than two hours Nair deals with that first blush of fame then Amelias solo Atlantic flight into legend her alleged love affair with Gore Vidals dad Gene ( Ewan McGregor) and her rivalry with younger pilot Elinor(c) Smith (Mia Wasikowska). The most thrilling scenes are Earharts arrivals -- in Wales where she was serenaded by stunned locals in Ireland where a shepherd informs her shes missed Paris by a fair bit.That compactness forced Nair to deal too literally with events and elements of Earharts life and legend. Navigator Fred Noonan (Christopher Eccleston) talks openly about his drinking; Putman bluntly creates bad blood with Smith by ordering her to finish a race behind Amelia.But Swank does wonders in capturing the essence of this woman so far ahead of her time. She has the right freckled rawboned look and she built on that to show a feisty sexy and capable woman with a touch of the gambler about her.""Only I can make a fulfilling life for myself"" she says. ""Dont let anyone turn you around."" Lindberghs life earned its own solid-to-the-point-of-corny bio-pic 50 years ago and it says something about how far Earhart was before her time that it took this long for her to earn similar treatment. For that reason Amelia earns a pass corny as it sometimes is. The lady earned her wings and Swank especially more than does right by both the woman and the legend.Amelia Three of five starsCast Hilary Swank Richard Gere Ewan McGregor Christopher EcclestonDirector Mira NairRunning time 1 hour 48 minutesIndustry rating PG for some sensuality language thematic elements and smoking.

To say that ""Amelia"" never gets off the ground would be an understatement; it barely makes it out of the hangar. Handsomely mounted yet dismayingly superficial Mira Nairs film offers snazzy aerial photography and inspirational platitudes in lieu of insight into Amelia Earharts storied life and high-flying career. Prestigious packaging led by Hilary Swanks gussied-up performance as the iconic aviatrix portends friendly commercial skies for the Fox Searchlight release at least initially. But critical disdain is unlikely to be countered by much audience enthusiasm even among admirers of this kind of old-fashioned star-powered bio-mush. Condensed by Ron Bass and Anna Hamilton Phelan from two hefty biographies (Susan Butlers ""East to the Dawn"" and Mary S. Lovells ""The Sound of Wings"") the 111-minute film unavoidably leaves out enough particulars to bug Earhart experts. But omission matters less than interpretation and what rankles most about ""Amelia"" is the timidity and lack of imagination with which Nair approaches one of Americas most exceptional and intriguing celebrity life stories. In focusing on the decade between Earharts first taste of fame in 1928 and her 1937 disappearance over the South Pacific during an attempt to fly around the world Nair frames the drama as the tale of a woman who chafed against gender barriers in pursuit of big dreams and inspired others to do the same. The theme is apparent from the moment Amelia an eager if inexperienced pilot meets George Putnam (Richard Gere) the New York publisher who made Charles Lindbergh a bestselling author and hopes to work similar wonders with a femme flyer. While George warns Amelia not to set her sights too high her pluck and resolve are such that she becomes the first woman to fly across the Atlantic albeit as a passenger making her an instant superstar (""Lady Lindy""). A few listless flashing-headline montages illustrate Amelias rise to stardom on the lecture circuit and in advertising which help fund her very expensive first love flying. Her second love is George whose marriage proposal she accepts after some resistance. But their union is strained by Amelias restlessness her unhappiness with the distractions of fundraising and most of all by her growing fondness for pilot and aeronautics professor Gene Vidal (Ewan McGregor) the father of a very young Gore Vidal (William Cuddy winning). Apart from one stolen kiss the film tiptoes around Butlers assertion that Amelia and Gene were lovers lest Amelia become too flawed (and thus too interesting) a heroine. But due to the writing and direction of Amelias romantic interludes with either George or Gene the half-formed love triangle never seems in danger of catching fire anyway. Not helping matters is the image of Gere playing yet another older man opposite a younger woman (a shot of Amelia and George on the beach looks like something out of ""Nights in Rodanthe""). But its Swank who must shoulder the heaviest thesping burden and her Amelia remains earthbound. An actress who does her best work in plain-spoken contempo working-class roles Swank is a decent physical match for her subject and her slightly androgynous appearance here underscores Earharts standing as a woman among men. But the characters passion hasnt been sufficiently dramatized (this Amelia likes to fly planes because the script says so) and every effort to transform Swank -- the close-cropped blonde hair the 30s costumes designed by Kasia Walicka Maimone the actress wobbly Kansas accent -- ends up feeling like one fussy affectation on top of another. Similarly Nair who has made fine films (""Monsoon Wedding"" ""The Namesake"") that stayed close to her Indian roots seems completely beholden to biopic formulas here. Slathered in banal voiceover narration and Gabriel Yareds hyperactive score the pic gets a lot of mileage out of Stuart Dryburghs f/x-enhanced aerial lensing (largely captured over South Africa). But the footage is postcard-pretty without being psychologically revealing; Imax documentaries and theme-park attractions offer comparable pleasures at a fraction of the length. Intermittent black-and-white newsreel footage of Earhart adds some interest but also feels like a nervous bid for authenticity. Amelias final flight (snippets of which are intercut with the narrative proper) is handled with tasteful directness steering clear of the conspiracy theories that have dogged Earharts legend. But ""Amelia"" seems uninterested in mining any fresh meaning or mystery from its subjects fate -- which though tragic was also instructive an American spin on the Icarus myth -- and the buoyant follow-your-dreams note struck at the end only trivializes it. As Fred Noonan the often-soused but skillful navigator who vanished along with Earhart Christopher Eccleston strikes up a prickly chemistry with Swank while Cherry Jones has her moment in the cockpit as a besotted Eleanor Roosevelt. Excellent period design boasts gleaming re-creations of vintage aircraft including the twin-engine Lockheed L-10 Electra that Earhart flew to the uncertain end.
