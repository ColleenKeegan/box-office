The finite divisions of time and space are no longer a cloak with which to conceal yourself from the American law enforcement agencies. According to Deja Vu the new soulless morale-booster from Tony Scott in the near future your tax dollars will not only enable governments to catch criminals but theyll be able to prevent crime from ever happening in the first place. Roughly two minutes after Jerry Bruckheimers name and production insignia have flashed across the opening titles a New Orleans passenger ferry explodes killing 500 people. Its the stock American Tragedy the government has been waiting for to try out a new piece of kit a time portal that leads four days and seven hours (why?) into the past. Denzel Washington is the charismatic investigator invited on to a special unit (led by a worryingly plump Val Kilmer) to stop patriotic loon Jim Caviezel from teaching the world a lesson with his trusty pick-up truck full of explosives. Scotts customary tics and traits are all here from the washed-out palette to his patented inability to keep the camera still for anything nearing a second (its as if hes directing every shot from the cockpit of a helicopter with half his mind on the controls and the other on his half-lit stogie). Take away a couple of neatly staged action sequences and youre left with a callously measured slab of US jingoism that deals with the most horrific human tragedies in the most lunk-headed and insulting way possible. But the message is clear dont worry people the forces of evil have been licked. Thank God for time travel.

Theyre working with a new surveillance technology dubbed Snow White that can peer into the past and call up living images from four days ago. Well thats pretty dazzling as snoopery systems go NSA eat your heart out. And ""Deja Vu"" is pretty dazzling as action adventures go even when its wildly almost defiantly implausible. Movies can make us semi-believe the damnedest things. This movie directed by Tony Scott at his usual headlong pace starts with a ghastly bang -- the terrorist bombing of a New Orleans ferry -- then seems to follow its natural path into a police procedural (or rather an ATF procedural since thats who employs Denzel Washingtons character a sharp-eyed smoothie of an agent named Doug Carlin.) Little by little however we along with Doug realize that weve been dragooned into a time-travel plot where huge energy is brought to bear on towering illogic. All time-travel plots are basically nonsense but Mr. Scott who first made his mark with flashy commercials sells this one by having his genius techies talk ever more loudly and quickly while psychedelic images flash across multiple screens. ""They found a way to fold space onto itself"" someone finally explains. Ah so thats how it works Got it. ENLARGE Lest I sell the movie short techno babble and visual gibberish are only a small part of its appeal. At first theres a fascinating whiff of necrophilia Doug becomes smitten with the retrieved images of a beautiful young murder victim Claire Kuchever whose death may have been connected to the terrorist plot. (Shes played attractively by Paula Patton.) Thats followed by a much stronger whiff of romance as he goes back in time and meets Claire in the course of trying to save her life and foil the plot. Instead of the Terminator hes the Resuscitator. During that longish tumultuous course the physical action amounts to a high-end videogame with a four-day delay; an icy villain is played with scary intensity by James Caviezel. Mr. Washington for his part is up to his hugely likable tricks -- most notably a willingness or eagerness to play against dark intense scenes with the same buoyant spirit he brought to ""Inside Man."" (The strong cast includes Val Kilmer Adam Goldberg and Bruce Greenwood. The cinematographer was Paul Cameron Chris Seagers designed the production and the editor was Chris Lebenzon.) A similar buoyancy sustains the screenplay which in its deja-viewed outline resembles a quite good Jean-Claude Van Damme thriller from 1994 called ""Timecop."" (The script is credited to Bill Marsilli who is making his feature debut and Terry Rossio whos left his voiceprints on one smart zinger after another.) Silly and self-important though the movie may sometimes be ""Deja Vu"" is memorable for a vision of technology-based omniscience that corresponds to our heady fantasies about electronic intelligence-gathering not to mention our hands-on experience with Google Earth. It gives new meaning to living in the past. The History Boys Two inseparable questions -- among many others -- are posed by ""The History Boys"" a thrillingly smart and immensely enjoyable screen version of Alan Bennetts celebrated play. What is education for and how best should it be conducted especially when in this case its beneficiaries/victims are clever crass scintillatingly verbal joyously shallow fact-stuffed sex-crazed boys who as almost-graduates of a small public school in Englands industrial North hope to win scholarships to Oxford or Cambridge? No clear answers are offered or required. This is not a multiple-choice film though its a multiple-theme excursion into the teeming minds of students and teachers alike. The time is the early 1980s and the drama derives from the scholarship quest. To coach the boys and enhance their chances as well as to bring greater glory to the school the hilariously smarmy headmaster hires a recent Oxford graduate Irwin (Stephen Campbell Moore) who as one boy notes with surprise is ""only five minutes older than we are."" Irwin is the modern man -- quick glib pragmatic ironic iconoclastic. In those five minutes he has mastered the art of teaching to the test and making it look almost reputable. Irwin represents one side of the plays dialectic -- though he doesnt just represent it he inhabits it with charm and verve. On the other side is the schools literature teacher Hector (the magnificent Richard Griffiths) a pudding-pile of a man and a Chips off the old block -- funny witty silly playful (too playful ultimately for his own good) and passionately dedicated to the proposition that education should impart the beginnings of wisdom and that wisdom resides not in facts fancy words or even love of language but in love of life and a deep investment in living it. Comparisons will inevitably be made to such inspirational-teacher films as ""Dead Poets Society"" and theyll be off the mark. ""The History Boys"" doesnt aim to inspire but to excite to stimulate to provoke. And it does so not only through its two dueling pedagogues but through a female teacher Mrs. Lintott (played by Frances de la Tour with heartbreaking irony and ferocity) and through the eight young history scholars themselves -- every one of them interesting each one a new world a-borning. The film was directed by Nicholas Hytner who first staged Alan Bennetts play at Londons National Theater. The question thats ritually asked about filmed plays is whether theyve been sufficiently opened up into real films but its the wrong question here. The screen like the stage can barely contain this marvelous play of intelligence. The Fountain ENLARGE Hugh Jackman stars in Darren Aronofskys fantasy The Fountain I feel for the marketing person charged with devising a tagline for Darren Aronofskys ""The Fountain"" a fantasy whose turgid pretensions defy the very notion of marketing. Still a tagline has been affixed to the campaign -- ""What if you could live forever?"" -- and it has a certain resonance especially after seeing the film which makes 96 minutes seem like eternity. The title refers to the Fountain of Youth which also manifests itself as the Tree Of Life -- pay attention because questions may be asked about the meaning of it all -- in a love story that spans 1000 years (including leap years). Hugh Jackman plays three incarnations of the same hero in the storys three interlocking time frames Tomas a Spanish conquistador serving his queen (whos played stiffly by Rachel Weisz); Tommy a scientist trying to find a cure for his wife Izzis brain tumor (Ms. Weisz again but more relaxed indeed recumbent) and Tom a 26th-century space traveler who with Izzi and the aforementioned tree navigates the galaxies in a snow globe. The images are often sumptuous though occasionally ludicrous -- the cinematographer was Matthew Libatique -- and Clint Mansells music is steadfastly oppressive.    DVD TIP James Caviezel co-starred -- he was billed as Jim Caviezel -- in another time-warping thriller ""Frequency"" (2000) which was directed by Gregory Hoblit from a script by Toby Emmerich. Thanks to weird sunspots Mr. Caviezels John a lonely cop in the New York of the 1990s is able to talk across three decades to his late father Frank played by Dennis Quaid via a ham-radio rig that once belonged to the old man.

But its the first to cash in on the trendy science of superstring theory. To be exact the movie is not strictly about traveling back in time; its about traveling into parallel universes of the past.For those of you who go into brain freeze at the mere mention of these concepts you will find little relief in ""Deja Vu."" I salute director Tony Scott and his screenwriters Terry Rossio and Bill Marsilii for attempting something new in the crime genre. Instead of the usual blam-blam stylistics that we have come to expect from the oeuvre of producer Jerry Bruckheimer we have here a wrinkle in the space-time continuum - a thriller that wants us to use our brains. This is always a highly risky commercial proposition.The problem is the filmmakers arent the clearest of thinkers. Once the superstring concept kicks in they seem as lost as we are and jawboning about fate and God and playing God doesnt change that. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Washington plays Doug Carlin an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives whose investigation into a deadly terrorist explosion of a New Orleans ferry leads him to a top-secret crime lab. Led by an FBI operative (an incongruously dweeby Val Kilmer) the lab seems to be merely an eye in the sky with a photographic backlog of everything - and I mean everything - under its watch. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 But its reach proves far greater than that. The key to solving the crime lies in unraveling the murder of Claire (Paula Patton) a beautiful woman whom Doug and his brainiac voyeurs home in on. Doug realizes that with a little temporal rejiggering he might be able to save both her and the hundreds blown up on the ferry who include many American servicemen and women.Needless to say - shades of ""Laura"" - Doug falls in love with Claire or at least her image. Presumably this is because he needs an extra incentive to solve the crime. For good measure the terrorist played with hollow-eyed steeliness by Jim Caviezel has offed Dougs ATF partner. Clearly Washington had a plethora of choices in answer to the oft-asked Method Actors query ""Whats my motivation?""Still its a bit unclear just who Doug is. Since it is now de rigueur for celluloid crime investigators to be a bit screwloose he initially comes across in the eccentric Monk mold. But then the filmmakers resort to standard-issue heroics. As Doug dips in and out of worm holes executing wheelies and skidding U-turns while wearing boundary-bending goggles he loses whatever specialness he had. He becomes a cog in the pyrotechnics.This may be the first crime thriller to explicitly utilize superstring theory but in its woozy romanticism its not that far removed from this years other time-warp movie ""The Lake House"" about two lovers living in parallel years - or ""Frequency"" which starred Jim Caviezel as a good guy.What gives the film its jolt of urgency is its New Orleans setting. ""Deja Vu"" is the first major movie to be shot there since the citys devastation. The images of real-world destruction undercut the trumped up action. Dougs obsession with going back in time to rescue Claire and the bombing victims functions as a metaphor for something far starker. What we really want him to do is turn back the clock on the horror of Katrina. Grade B Rated PG-13 for violence terror disturbing images and some sensuality.

Opens today Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Dj Vu"" with Denzel Washington Paula Patton Val Kilmer Jim Caviezel Adam Goldberg Elden Henson Erika Alexander. Directed by Tony Scott from a screenplay by Bill Marsilii and Terry Rossio. 128 minutes. Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and terror disturbing images and some sensuality. Several theaters. Tony Scotts odd but entertaining time-travel thriller ""Deja Vu"" features plenty of Science Moments that Hollywood-movie phenomenon in which supporting actors costumed to look like MIT graduates explain scientific concepts to the movies star (and by extension to the rest of us). Here Denzel Washington gets told about wormholes and quantum physics and ""a single trailing moment of now in the past"" -- but his character an ATF agent named Doug Carlin whos investigating a bombing just isnt buying it. Its rather endearing He grins and looks skeptical and the physicists keep explaining and eventually he just kind of agrees to accept it so they can move on which is what the audience needs to do too. So if you can do that (me Im still turning over the movies ending in my head but I suppose I just need to accept it and move on) ""Deja Vu"" might work just fine for you. Scott longtime purveyor of clock-ticking action thrillers (""Man on Fire"" ""Spy Game"") here dips a toe in the time-travel genre and while he stubs it just a bit the movies saved by an appealing star a swift pace and a vivid setting (New Orleans parts of it devastated by Hurricane Katrina). Washingtons played roles like this before (he was a similarly smart jovial cop in ""Inside Man"" earlier this year) but he knows how to convey intelligence with a quick gaze and to lighten a mood with a playful tone of voice. The screenplay by Bill Marsilii and Terry Rossio doesnt give much backstory on Carlin but Washington plays him as a loner who cloaks his darker moods in breeziness. Unexpectedly falling in love with the subject of his investigation -- a beautiful woman named Claire (newcomer Paula Patton) who is by all reasonable measures dead -- hes surprised by the fervor of his efforts to find the key to her murder and to a related bombing of a ferry. Introduced to a renegade team of physicists whove created a way to revisit the recent past (by ""folding space back onto itself"" in case you were wondering) Carlin races backwards in time to try to save her. Its all very high-concept and like most of Scotts movies its longer than it needs to be but theres something irresistible about the technology at its core with a bunch of wisecracking techno whizzes (Adam Goldberg as their bearded leader has a funny deadpan) totally at ease with the idea of bending time to their whim. Its a bizarre form of Hollywood science requiring Washington to strip down to his skivvies before getting zapped into the past. (Hey in ""Timeline"" didnt they have to don medieval garb -- i.e. put on MORE clothes -- before doing the same thing?) Im hoping Washingtons next outing lets him race a little less and act a little more; the hint of romantic yearning he brings here is intriguing and something he rarely gets to explore on screen. ""Deja Vu"" works as a serviceable star vehicle but its nothing we havent seen before.

Bruckheimers contribution to Disney should not be underestimated; he has produced 17 films for it since 1991 which have brought in 5 billion at box offices around the world. But as part of a corporate shift under the new Disney chief executive Robert Iger the studio pledged this summer to make fewer films and focus on family-friendly movies that are marketable across all the companys businesses including theme parks plush toys and television. That meant Bruckheimer was now in the onscreen amusement park business -- a far cry from the highly stylized color-saturated movies and television shows that made him famous.

With Denzel Washington Paula Patton and Jim Caviezel. Directed by Tony Scott. (PG-13. 128 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to www.sfgate.com/movies .) The deja vu youre likely to experience watching the new oddly familiar movie with that title could come from anywhere. ""Deja Vu"" depicts time travel causal loops and paradox -- all staples of Hollywood fantasy and science fiction. Weve also seen plenty of orange fireballs exploding onscreen before although to give ""Deja Vu"" credit its opening scene of a New Orleans passenger ferry going up in flames is awfully impressive considering it was accomplished without computer fakery. The single compelling element in this needlessly complicated and confusing thriller -- the loose ends would stretch from here to eternity -- is the obsessive love that federal investigator Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington) brought in to determine if the explosion was a terrorist attack develops for a beautiful murder victim. So lets travel farther back in time 62 years to be precise to pinpoint my own deja vu the unforgettable ""Laura."" Though Doug has more to fuel his obsession than Dana Andrews 1944 detective who was stuck with only a portrait of a dead woman to drool over while determining who did her in the two sleuths are in a similar pickle. Talk about unrequited love. This being the 21st century Doug gets to watch a satellite surveillance tape shot three days before the lovely Claire (Paula Patton) is fished out of the Mississippi River. From the moment he sees her step into a steamy shower Claire is the face in the misty light ... but shes only a dream. Or is she? The risks Doug is willing to take to save Claire from her date with the grim reaper are what keep you following the story even after a mind-numbing explanation of how government physicists secretly figured out a way to peer into the past. It has to do with energy and folding space back onto itself in case you care to take a crack at it. Washington oozes sex appeal -- hes got sort of a peacock strut -- but rarely gets to make use of it onscreen. So credit director Tony Scott and screenwriters Bill Marsilii and Terry Rossio for providing their star with a lover even a phantom one. Claires dead the first time Doug lays eyes on her; but the way he holds her hand its almost as if he doesnt notice. Her body is covered with residue from the same lethal ingredients as the bomb that killed the ferry passengers -- uniformed sailors on an outing with their families -- although she died prior to the explosion. From this information Doug concludes her murderer and the bomber are one and the same. Dougs love for Claire motivates him to travel back in time where he may be able to prevent 500-odd casualties a good days work for any cop. Scott is known for action pictures such as ""Top Gun"" ""Enemy of the State"" Crimson Tide"" and ""Man on Fire"" the last two with Washington. The director keeps ""Deja Vu"" so pumped up that theres hardly time to think about holes in the plot. Even before the abridged lesson in quantum physics that should have physicists rolling in the aisles theres a scene where Doug informs Claires father that his beloved daughter is dead. His calm response doesnt make sense. Its not as if hes in shock. He hardly seems to care. Washington has become so big that he can carry a movie on his own. He plays Doug with the watchful eye you would expect from someone in his profession but also with an unexpected sense of humor. The supporting cast isnt given much to do. Patton (""Idlewild"" ""Hitch"") brings an ethereal presence to flashback scenes of Claire during the last remaining days of her life. Jim Caviezel is suitably creepy in the Kevin Spacey role from ""Se7en"" showing up near the end guilty as sin and totally unrepentant about the deaths hes caused. Washingtons only true co-star is post-Katrina New Orleans. Even in its devastated condition the city remains something special. The French Quarter looks eerily the way it used to. Its enough to give you deja vu. Advisory Explosions and violent scenes.

Dj Vu feels oddly familiar - USATODAY.com SearchHow do I find it?Subscribe to paper Home News Travel Money Sports Life Tech Weather Movies Cars  Event tickets   Jobs Real estate  Shop   Online degrees Deja Vu feels oddly familiar Updated 11/21/2006 1015 PM ET E-mail | Print | By Scott Bowles USA TODAY Deja Vu (  out of four) posits that its possible to travel back in time to change the mistakes of the past. If thats true moviegoers may want to advise director Tony Scott to use that portal to make a less befuddling film. MORE Washington Patton get familiar | See a clip Although it sports an impressive pedigree including Denzel Washington as its star and Jerry Bruckheimer as its producer Deja Vu cannot escape the weight of its murky science action-film formula and preposterous ending. And thats a shame because the movie has promise particularly with its top-notch special effects and chilling opening sequence -- an explosion aboard a New Orleans ferry boat that kills more than 540 people. Enter Doug Carlin (Washington) an ATF agent with a knack for finding clues that everyone else seems to miss. Washington plays this stock character with such charm that we forgive the cliche. Carlin discovers that the federal government has a top-secret program that allows it to spy on anyone it deems dangerous thanks to satellite technology and thermal imaging. Its an effective device in this era of heightened tensions over homeland security. But Carlin soon learns that the government isnt peeking through walls; its looking into the past. Scientists hes told accidentally discovered a hole in the time/space continuum that allows them to look back exactly 102 hours. Handy for catching the football game you missed but tough to do much about a crime thats already occurred. Or is it? The film spends a lot of time trying to convince audiences that the science is possible so you can send a note to the past. Or a person. Its all a set-up for a standard time-travel thriller that includes gunfights explosions and (stay with me here) a car chase with a suspect who went down the same road 41/2 days earlier. Filmmakers boast that the movie is rooted in real academic theories about wormholes and parallel universes. But those premises are too lofty to be explained or effective in a two-hour Disney movie. And the pat ending seems less the product of science than a studio executive who walked out of a test screening that went poorly. Deja Vu reteams Scott and Washington who collaborated on the fine Man on Fire. Where their first film worked by examining a man haunted by his past this one stumbles by having him literally revisit it. (Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and terror disturbing images and some sensuality. Running time 2 hours 8 minutes. Opens nationwide today.) Posted 11/21/2006 900 PM ET Updated 11/21/2006 1015 PM ET E-mail | Print | Enlarge Touchstone Pictures From out of the past Denzel Washington stars as an ATF agent investigating a ferry explosion in New Orleans who wanders into strange territory.

Owing a conceptual debt to both ""Grand Hotel"" and ""Nashville"" its a star-studded sentimental panorama that earnestly attempts to encapsulate that traumatic idealistic time through its ""representative"" fictional characters. They include Demi Moore as an alcoholic singer; Sharon Stone as a hairdresser; William H. Macy as her unfaith-ful husband the hotel manager; Lindsay Lohan as a girl marrying Elijah Wood to keep him from going to Vietnam. Laurence Fishburne is an erudite chef; Ashton Kutcher an acid dealer and Martin Sheen Emilios dad a depressive businessman. Etc. All the actors get their Big Moments but verisimilitude goes out the window.Finally we get the assassination. The director pulls out all the stops showing us the horror and chaos in slow motion as we hear RFKs eloquent pleas for national healing and an end to violence. You dont have to have lived through the period to find this wrenching. And you dont have to doubt Estevezs sincerity to find it emotionally opportunistic.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

Comments Deja Vu After a terrorist explosion kills the passengers on a New Orleans ferry an ATF agent (Denzel Washington) discovering that a form of time travel can send him back to the event resolves to save the life of a woman (Paula Patton) killed shortly before as well as prevent the explosion. The story recalls Otto Premingers Laura (1944) in its romantic moodiness and has some of the philosophical poignance common to tales of time travel. But the SF hardware (enjoyable) and thriller mechanics (mechanical) of this Jerry Bruckheimer slam-banger dont mesh very well with reflection and the action trumps most evidence of thought. Tony Scott directed a script by Bill Marsilii and Terry Rossio; with Val Kilmer and James Caviezel. PG-13 128 min.

"Deja Vu | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; deja-vu ) Deja Vu (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli Wedding the phrase ""Jerry Bruckheimer production"" with the words ""intelligent screenplay"" might seem to be an unimaginable mismatch but it has happened. DA(c)jA  Vu the new thriller from Bruckheimer and director Tony Scott impresses with both the complexity of its storyline and its willingness to allow things to develop at their own pace without interjecting a lot of needless action scenes into the early proceedings to keep viewers attentive. DA(c)jA  Vu contains its share of action but it comes later in the film. In fact one could argue that the movie features one of the most original car chase sequences ever committed to celluloid. This is a time travel movie - sort of. I hesitate to call it science fiction because theres little science to go along with the fiction (although the movie makes a game try to incorporate a few Einstein-based concepts into the screenplay). Something like Minority Report is a science fiction thriller; DA(c)jA  Vu is more a straightforward thriller that uses time travel as a device. Of course with time travel come time travel paradoxes. Thats where the fun lies. If you go back in time can you alter events or do you become part of them? Part of DA(c)jA  Vus enjoyment is that while it doesnt ignore the paradoxes it doesnt overthink them either. It allows the viewer to toy with them in his/her mind then gives an unambiguous interpretation. Were he alive Carl Sagan might not be impressed but in terms of allowing audiences to do more than gaze slack-jawed at the screen this is light years ahead of anything Bruckheimer has previously attempted. The director is Tony Scott whose resume is so maddeningly inconsistent that it makes one wonder whether there are two men working under the same name. DA(c)jA  Vu is the product of the ""good"" Scott. He directs in a no-frills manner keeping things moving and injecting a fair amount of suspense. There arent that many surprises - at least for the viewer who pays attention - and thats a blessing. Twists in time travel movies are almost always cheesy. The lack of narrative contortions does little to diminish the movies impact. More importantly Scott curbs his tendencies to exhibit his ""artistic side"" by doing all sorts of weird things with the camera. That part of the directors repertoire is kept in check. Its Fat Tuesday in New Orleans February 2006. The city still recovering from Hurricane Katrina is about to take another blow. A ferry explodes just off shore killing more than 500 people many of them members of the military and their children. Its identified almost immediately as an act of terrorism. Enter ATF agent Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington) whose initial observations earn him the admiration and attention of FBI agent Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer) who runs the elite agency taking the point in the investigation. Carlin is recruited and soon finds himself looking through a window in time that gives amazingly clear images of events that occurred exactly four days and six hours ago. Pryzwarras explanation is that its a digital composite of satellite images but Carlin doesnt believe him. He thinks its something else and hes determined to find out what. Meanwhile Carlin discovers a connection between the ferry bombing and the murder of a young woman Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton). With a Laura-like obsession Carlin begins to study everything about Claire watching her life unfold as time ticks away to the moment when her life will end. The first half of DA(c)jA  Vu is a police procedural with a twist. Carlin is investigating the murder and terrorist act but he mixes traditional and non-traditional methods. His advantage is the time window but it has its drawbacks as well. Those include a ""no rewind"" option and a limited range. The latter leads to the previously mentioned car chase which is unlike anything attempted in a movie. The rest of the first hour relies on the appeal of programs like CSI as Carlin builds his case against a domestic terrorist (Jim Caviezel) but there are gaping holes and unexplained evidence. Those looking for Bruckheimers trademark action scenes have to be patient. They arrive but aside from the car chase all occur during the second hour. Thats when DA(c)jA  Vu becomes more routine. The movie never abandons its premise but the first hour is more intellectually engaging than the second. By the time the things shift into high gear for its last act were in familiar action territory. The ending is satisfactory and satisfying and it is presented with enough clarity that there wont be much head scratching. Denzel Washington plays Denzel Washington good cop. This isnt a great performance but Washington wasnt brought in to show off his acting chops. Hes here to give the audiences a friendly face they can identify with. Likewise theres not much for performers like Val Kilmer Matt Craven and Adam Goldberg to do except move the narrative forward. The most interesting work belongs to Paula Patton who plays a dead woman. Its not hard to understand why Carlin is haunted by her. DA(c)jA  Vu is a little long but it covers a lot of ground. Its an imperfect motion picture but it has lots to recommend it and the more egregious flaws dont become apparent until post-movie ruminations. Whether or not it earns the distinction at the box office DA(c)jA  Vu is being positioned as the premiere Thanksgiving weekend action movie. Its more flavorful than a lot of films that have claimed the title over the years and its definitely no turkey.

Time-bending and tense-switching dimensions send ""Deja Vu"" to the level of an existential sci-fi thriller sure to elicit post-screening discussions and a fine holiday take. A wrinkle in time gives texture and cinematic power to Tony Scotts exquisitely rendered ""Deja Vu."" The deliberate explosion of a New Orleans ferry carrying hundreds of U.S. sailors triggers what at first looks like the ultimate ""CSI"" episode care of producer Jerry Bruckheimer. But time-bending and tense-switching dimensions send ""Deja Vu"" to the level of an existential sci-fi thriller sure to elicit post-screening discussions and a fine holiday take. Third match of Scott and star Denzel Washington (""Crimson Tide"" ""Man on Fire"") is the least overtly dramatic but the most resonant with the duo giving solidity to a concept that would fly apart in less sure hands. Scott understands filmmaking as well as any Hollywood helmer and easily connects with Washington with both aspects wedded here to rewarding ends. Opening nine minutes comprise a wordless montage of sailors and their families enjoying Mardi Gras on a New Orleans river ferry followed by an enormous bomb blast that sends bodies and cars into the river. Even by Bruckheimer standards this is one mother of a fireball realistically staged. ATF agent Doug Carlin (Washington) a vet of the Oklahoma City attack meticulously investigates the massive crime scene which involves 543 victims. He links the bomber to a woman named Claire (Paula Patton) whose body was found some distance from the bombing before the attack itself. Figuring that Claire had some connection to the bomber Carlin examines her home and is stunned to hear himself on her answering machine. Hes in for a bigger surprise from FBI agent Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer) working under straight-laced lead investigator Jack McCready (Bruce Greenwood). Spotting Carlins skills Pryzwarra introduces him to a team of techies who have apparently developed software that can digitally re-create images from four days earlier. With their nifty tools and visuals scientists Denny (Adam Goldberg) Gunnars (Elden Henson) and Shanti (Erika Alexander) are able to scan Claire at home prior to the tragedy. Sequences in the so-called ""time-window"" lab suggest the scope of surveillance on private lives as well as serving up a dazzling metaphysical lightshow in which Carlin becomes the auds surrogate pondering the reality of what hes seeing. The labs work pushes the story into the realm of string theory wormholes Einstein and the ""folding"" of time. What Carlin sees is in fact the recent past ""bridged"" to the present. In a visually inventive mind-twisting chase Carlin tracks the bomber IDd as Carroll Oerstadt (Jim Caviezel) simultaneously in the present and four days prior by using a ""time-window"" portable viewfinder device. Cinemas natural felicities for time and action have seldom felt as beautifully dovetailed. And even when the plot in Bill Marsilii and Terry Rossios script begins to push plausibility it stays grounded in Washingtons emotional drive as Carlin to rescue Claire from a death that seems to be her destiny. Kilmer and Greenwood are in fairly perfunctory ""CSI""-like roles but Patton is allowed a fascinating range as a single woman first viewed from a distance of time and space and later close up. Caviezel is pure right-wing malevolence in a role that counters his usually beatific countenance. Pic is a technical marvel at the highest level with Scott regulars (including lenser Paul Cameron editor Chris Lebenzon and production designer Chris Seagers) operating at full imaginative throttle. Tech heads will buzz about lab sequences for weeks afterward. Big Easy locales filmed post-Katrina are lavishly used.
