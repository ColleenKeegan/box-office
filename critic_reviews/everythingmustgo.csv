Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; everything-must-go ) Everything Must Go (United States 2011) May 15 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli As their careers develop many comedians yearn to cross over into serious dramatic roles if only on occasion. This has happened with John Cleese Steve Martin Robin Williams Tom Hanks Jim Carrey and Adam Sandler. Some are more successful than others but expectations play as big a part in the actors reception as the actual performance. Everything Must Go is not Will Ferrells first ""straight"" part (previous serious - or at least semi-serious - endeavors include Stranger than Fiction and Winter Passing) but its the first time he has consciously leeched all but the most subtle humor from his character. There are not a lot of laughs in Dan Rushs directorial debut nor are there intended to be. Rush keeps the tone as light as possible but no one would mistake this for anything other than a quirky character-based drama. The question is Is there an audience for Everything Must Go? Ferrells core demographic will likely be as stupefied by his performance as Sandlers devotees were by Punch Drunk Love. Can a wider audience accept someone previously recognized as a goofball clown as an alcoholic everyman who isnt a ""funny drunk""? Ferrells portrayal is convincing. We end up rooting for his Nick Halsey even though the man is by his own admission unreliable and prone to bad judgments. Hardly a frame goes by when Nick isnt holding a beer can in one hand. The story transpires in a generic suburban town in Arizona. Nick is experiencing the worst day of his life. After being fired from his job he comes home to discover that his wife has left him changing all the locks and throwing his stuff out on the front lawn. Shortly thereafter he learns that the woman scorned has frozen his bank account and canceled his credit cards. If he had a dog it would have up-and-died. Despondent Nick buys a couple of six-packs and collapses in a recliner sitting among the debris of his failed marriage in his front yard. It looks like hes ready to stay there for the rest of his life until his policeman friend and AA sponsor Frank Garcia (Michael Pena) shows up with a ""yard sale"" permit. That gives Nick five days to get his act together before the cops will forcibly remove him. At first Nick plans to spend that time drinking but he eventually decides to give the yard sale a try. So he hires a local kid Kenny (Christopher Jordan Wallace) to help out with the logistics. Meanwhile a new neighbor across the street Samantha (Rebecca Hall) shows sympathy for the obviously downtrodden Nick. In its telling of a tale of a man fighting an addiction Everything Must Go covers no new ground and is more generally hopeful than many similar stories. Nick is a functioning drunk which means that we are rarely subjected to the episodes of mania melancholia and rage that are staples of dramas about alcoholics and alcoholism. With the exception of the sequence in which Nick goes through withdrawal because hes without money and booze Rushs treatment of the disease is subdued (at least when compared to the traditional cinematic portrayal of it). Nick is not repugnant or cartoonish (contrast this character with Russell Brands Arthur re-interpretation); he has ""a good heart"" and even when drunk he doesnt turn into a monster (at least not that we see). The arc traversed by Everything Must Go follows Nick from denial to acceptance and when the closing credits make their appearance the unanswered questions are secondary to the sense of partial closure. Everything Must Go features two key relationships. The first is the bond that develops between Nick and Kenny a kid who spends his days riding a bicycle up and down the block. Due in part to a lack in the screenplay this friendship seems forced and undernourished. Other movies in which kids and adults have forged ties have accomplished something more emotionally satisfying when establishing a surrogate father/son relationship. The second is the interaction between Nick and Samantha the pregnant woman-across-the-street who is waiting for her husband to join her in their new home. Nick and Samantha are both lonely and they discover a temporary kinship in that loneliness. The best scene between them occurs as they sit outside eating Chinese while Nick confides his failures to Samantha. Rush wisely avoids turning this into a romance. That would be an obvious and inappropriate connection and would have degraded the honesty and simplicity of the story. As with all character studies this one hinges entirely on the viewers ability to accept Ferrell in the lead role. Credit is deserved; during the course of Everything Must Go I never felt the sense of disconnect that sometimes occurs while watching a comedian attempt something serious. I was not waiting for a punch line. I was not primed to laugh. I accepted Ferrell as Nick and because of that I was able to enjoy Everything Must Go on its own terms.

Everything Must Go reviewed Does Will Ferrell have a Bill Murray future? Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 13 2011 418 PM Everything Must Go Does Will Ferrell have a Bill Murray future? By Dana Stevens Everything Must Go For a film about one mans descent into alcoholism and semi-homelessness Everything Must Go (Roadside Attractions) feels surprisingly jaunty. Perhaps thats because this wisp of an indie written and directed by first-time filmmaker Dan Rush from a short story by Raymond Carver stars Will Ferrell a comedian who specializes in seeming at once wistful and indestructible. Like Frank the Tank Ferrells hard-partying character in the curiously memorable comedy Old School this films sort-of-hero Nick Halsey dimly intuits that hes responsible for his own unhappiness and that its in his power to change. He just needs to sit down and have a couple beers while he thinks the whole thing through. In the first scene Nick loses his job as a salesman thanks to a chronic drinking problem and a nebulous sexual-harassment claim by a colleague. Driving home from work with a flask in his hand he discovers that his wife has just left him changed all the locks on their house and dragged his belongings onto the front lawn. Nicks response to the sudden obliteration of his entire life is to put off responding He simply plops down in his favorite recliner busts out a 12-pack and spends the night in the yard. For the next several days there he sits amid his crates of LPs and baseball memorabilia refusing to budge even when his AA sponsor a cop (Michael Pena) threatens to have him arrested. Eventually the cop grants Nick three days to sell off everything in his yard. Advertisement In traditional indie fashion various oddballs cross Nicks path a pregnant photographer (Rebecca Hall) has just moved in across the street and is awaiting her husbands arrival while a lonely chubby kid (Christopher Jordan Wallace son of the late rapper Biggie Smalls) spends his days cruising up and down the street on his bike. Nick promptly connects with and then alienates both of them showing us how easy it must have been for this man to arrive at the nadir hes reached. Leafing through a pile of high-school yearbooks Nick is inspired to visit an old classmate (impeccably played by Laura Dern) who responds to his clumsy overtures first with warmth then puzzlement. If these developments sound slight and meandering so is the movie. Everything Must Go has a spacious under-inhabited feeling; the Carver story its based on is only four pages long and theres a fair bit of narrative vamping to fill an hour and a half of screen time. But that spaciousness gives Ferrell room to create his character from the ground up. By the end we know the self-defeating sentimental stubborn Nick Halsey very well and were really rooting for him to get himself and his junk off the lawn. The redemptive ending feels a little too quickly earned and theres a late plot twist involving the cop friend thats both implausible and unnecessary. But Ferrells performance particularly in his scenes with the soulful young Wallace augurs well for his future as a more-than-comic actor. This isnt Ferrells first dramatic role; he played seriocomic leading men in Stranger Than Fictionand Woody Allens Melinda and Melinda. But its the first one that provides a glimpse at his possible future as a Bill Murray-style character actor a funny man with deep reserves of sadness at his disposal.

By Peter Rainer Film critic May 13 2011 Save for later Saved Will Ferrell in a scene from ""Everything Must Go."" Roadside Attractions          View Caption About video ads View Caption of ""Everything Must Go"" starring Will Ferrell is based on a 1981 Raymond Carver short story called ""Why Dont You Dance?"" about a man who for unclear reasons has strewn his worldly possessions onto his lawn. His life or at least its material contents becomes a kind of cosmic yard sale.Carvers metaphor is all too real in these recessionary times and serves as a springboard for first-time writer-director Dan Rushs film. By fleshing out the story Rush loses Carvers eerie suggestiveness the sense of violence percolating beneath the humdrum. Rushs literalmindedness about the woes of Ferrells Nick Halsey - his wife threw him out changed the locks and canceled his credit cards - in some ways feels closer to John Cheever than to Carver. Still the picture of Nick beyond zonked surveying the sum total of his belongings hits home. Its powerfully sad.On the same day that he was thrown out by his wife (whom we never see) Nick whose drinking has caught up with him also loses his job as a salesman. At first he doesnt want to do anything about the mess on the lawn. He cant bear to part with any of it - the furniture the blenders the sporting goods the old LPs the high school yearbooks. Rush draws on the intense attachment we can feel for the mundane objects in our lives. For Nick these things are talismans from a past that promised a lot more than it delivered. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Theres a wonderful sequence where he reads a flowery inscription in his senior high school yearbook from a girl and then tracks her down. Delilah (Laura Dern) now a single mother is still living in the same suburban Phoenix neighborhood. Their brief awkward meeting is remarkably underplayed. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Nick doesnt open up to her about his predicament and she doesnt pry but she knows hes hurting. She tells him ""You have a good heart and that doesnt change"" and shes right. Nick at that moment is brought back to the person he was - and deep down still is.Ferrell has rarely attempted serious - or in this case seriocomic - roles. When he has as in ""Stranger Than Fiction"" he often seems underpowered as if in zapping his comic side he neutralized what was most original about him as a performer.But because Nick is so benumbed by his predicament Ferrells deadpan makes sense here. When it cracks - especially in the scene with Delilah or in the sequences involving Samantha (the wonderful Rebecca Hall) a pregnant young photographer who has moved in across the street - you can see the sorrow and the anger that the blankness was covering up.Perhaps because he was worried that the film might seem too static and underpopulated Rush works in a few too many moments involving a sympathetic cop (Michael Pena) and a local kid Kenny (Christopher Jordan Wallace son of the late rapper Notorious B.I.G.).The cop happens to be Nicks AA sponsor which is a bit too convenient and the boy is a homespun deus ex machina.Rush wants us to believe that by ridding himself of his stuff Nick is liberated. Given what has come before this rings false. (Is he also a member of Hoarders Anonymous?) But ""Everything Must Go"" stays with you anyway. If there is a single image that we take away from Arthur Millers ""Death of a Salesman"" it is of Willy Loman weighted down to his very soul by his suitcases. The image that holds in this modern-day salesmans serenade is Nick the salesman reduced to selling off his own life. Grade B+ (Rated R for language and some sexual content.)

By Joe Morgenstern Updated May 13 2011 1201 a.m. ET If this is only a chick flick then call me a chick. Witty raunchy and affecting ""Bridesmaids"" crosses boundaries by blithely ignoring them. At one moment its a broad-gauge farce that examines sex from a womans point of view. (The findings are mixed at best.) At another its a sophisticated comedy of manners and class that pits two bridesmaids against each other for control of the wedding if not the brides destiny. Through it all--the free-form conversations the brilliant set pieces the preposterous gross-outs the flawless performances--Kristen Wiigs forlorn maid of honor Annie seeks her own destiny with a wrenchingly cockeyed passion. A womans point of view is one of the films great distinctions. The screenplay was written by Ms. Wiig and Annie Mumolo--both women are wise in the ways of improv as well as TV--and directed with extraordinary finesse by Paul Feig who created the TV series ""Freaks and Geeks."" As a man though Id say its greatest distinction is its inclusiveness and Im not using that sticky term to be PC. The filmmakers and their producer Judd Apatow see the comedy genre as including all sorts of quirks and qualities that make us human--effusiveness obtuseness tenderness fury delicacy idiocy eloquence. Their characters cannot stop talking. A bad thing? No a great thing because the talk is so smart. Theyve staged the best highway sobriety test since ""The Man With Two Brains"" turned baked goods to the best romantic advantage since ""Waitress."" And the movies Mr. Right couldnt be odder or righter. The bride Lillian (Maya Rudolph) is forlorn in her own way. She knows her impending marriage will distance her from Annie her best friend since childhood. She also knows that her wedding plans are being hijacked by the richest and pushiest of her bridesmaids the ethereally insufferable Helen (a beautifully measured performance by Rose Byrne). The Annie-Helen rivalry fuels much of the plot. It starts slowly and slyly at a celebratory party with rival speeches that keep on going and building and getting funnier. That seems to be the scripts organizing principle--first do this then add that then top it then push it a little higher and keep it going as long as theres something to build on. The result isnt organized all that well--a few scenes misfire and the whole thing goes on a bit too long. (The film might have done with less or with none of Annies grotesque English roommates; theyre built on nothing but arbitrary notions.) That said though the wonder is how often ""Bridesmaids"" reaches the heights and sustains the altitude. ENLARGE Kristen Wiigs Annie has a high old time on a plane in Bridesmaids. Universal Studios A sweetly ridiculous riff with a radar speed gun builds on repetition and expectation--how many cars will it take before...? (I cant resist describing some of this delicious stuff but Im not going to spoil it with details.) A tennis game turns savage. Belching forth from nowhere a gastric event grows too ghastly for words. A gathering of bridesmaids on a flight to Vegas out-airplanes ""Airplane"" as it rises to pure--and I use the word advisedly--pandemonium. Each bridesmaid has her daft appeal though none is as genuinely crazed--or outrageously entertaining--as Melissa McCarthys Megan a creature of formidable girth and unstoppable id. (Annies mother is played by the late Jill Clayburgh an actress and comedienne whose career constituted an anthology of lovely performances.) At the heart of the film is poor desperate Annie who lost the bakery she had opened just as the economy tanked and has yet to find herself as a fully functioning adult. Her car is a wreck though its a Lamborghini compared to her love life which centers on a smarmy Narcissus who treats her like a consumer product thats both disposable and renewable. (Its a tribute to the filmmakers verve that theyve kept the sex scenes funny--extremely funny--since what were seeing is sheer self-abasement.) Ms. Wiigs first starring role on the big screen is a sensation; how could it have taken so long? She is wistful but never tearful in the worst of Annies turmoil intensely likable without trying to be unfailingly interesting and in her big moments--one of which involves a giant cookie--a paragon of antic energy. Then theres the man behind the radar gun a cop named Rhodes whos played to perfection by Chris ODowd. (Its an inspired piece of casting.) ""The cop talks weird"" Annies Porsche-driving lover observes at one point and so he does. He talks with a pleasing accent Mr. ODowd is Irish. He speaks with gentle humor and unforced wisdom whether hes citing Annie for dysfunctional tail lights or confronting her to her confusion and dismay with indisputable evidence of her competence. Rhodes doesnt play a huge role in the proceedings but hes worth citing as evidence of the movies excellence. Heres a man written by women who is both a fantasy figure--this is wedding comedy after all not kitchen realism--and a convincingly endearing original. ""Bridesmaids"" gets at so many things with deceptive ease and startling skill--womens anger the loneliness of the single life the marriage trap the pain of sex along with the joy but also friendship sanity and a vision of love. Watch a clip from ""Hesher"" starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt Rainn Wilson and Natalie Portman. Hesher Spencer Sussers debut feature stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a guardian demon who brings life to a bereaved household in what amounts to a long-running home invasion. Mr. Gordon-Levitt is a gifted young actor and a compelling presence in everything he does. In this title role of an outlaw vulgarian and very likely a nut job hes constantly in motion and you cant take your eyes off him. For all of Heshers extravagances though--his foul mouth his wild hair his runaway libido his fondness for heavy metal and his penchant for arson--he isnt particularly interesting not even when hes mentoring T.J. a newly motherless boy played touchingly by Devin Brochu. Thats not the actors fault. The problem lies in the role. Rather than a character rooted in some sort of reality--social satirical psychological take your pick--Hesher is an abstract notion animated by false energy. Almost 80 years ago the peerless French filmmaker Jean Renoir used a similar notion in ""Boudu Saved From Drowning."" (Its readily available on DVD and I wouldnt be surprised if Mr. Susser has seen it.) Michel Simon was the scruffy bum--the protohippie really--who throws himself into the Seine and is saved by a Good Samaritan then turns his rescuers household upside down. But Boudu served Renoir as an instrument of social satire. Hesher serves Mr. Susser who wrote the screenplay with David Michod as not much more than an anxiety-making machine in a movie that otherwise depends on moist cliches (Rainn Wilsons lachrymose widower T.J.s puppy love for Natalie Portmans nebbishy loser) and life-affirming gestures (the movies climax) that feel like borrowings from MTV. The conspicuous exception to these cold calculations is Madeleine the indiscriminately loving grandmother played by my ex-wife Piper Laurie. Madeleine seems to be in the early stages of dementia; at one point she isnt sure if shes sitting in the dark. Everything about this old lady is enchantingly vague--the story she tells about baking a cake with a shortening called Fluffo the basis of her strong bond with Hesher--but nothing needs to be spelled out for Ms. Laurie turns uncertainty into poetry. Her calculation is to toss the calculator. Everything Must Go ENLARGE Will Ferrell as a troubled alcoholic in Everything Must Go based on the Raymond Carver story. Roadside Attractions/Everett Collection According to a screenwriting commonplace--a valid one--big sprawling novels can be rich sources for screenplays (""The Godfather"") while movies adapted from short stories (""The Swimmer"") run the risk of feeling thin. It may seem perverse to mention a film as deservedly obscure as ""The Swimmer"" in the context of Will Ferrells ambitious new vehicle but extreme examples can be illuminating. In that old Burt Lancaster film adapted from a John Cheever story an unhappy suburbanite re-examines his life in the course of swimming home in a succession of neighbors pools. Its nothing but a device and far from a good one. Dan Rush adapted ""Everything Must Go"" from a very short (1600 words) Raymond Carver story about a man sitting on his lawn surrounded by all the things of his life that hes getting rid of in a yard sale. Its a much better movie but still based on a single device and thin and repetitive for the same reason. Watch a clip of Will Ferrells latest movie Everything Must Go. Video courtesy of Roadside Attractions. Indeed its basically a one-man show thats short on conflict. Mr. Ferrells Nick Halsey is an alcoholic who finds himself jobless and then homeless--his wife has shut him out of their suburban house. Contemplating his life as he sits on his lawn in the midst of his worldly goods he has almost no one to talk to but his 12-step sponsor a local cop played by Michael Pena and a neighborhood kid Kenny (Christopher Jordan Wallace.) Another neighbor played by Rebecca Hall appears only sporadically and to negligible effect. It would be nice to report that Mr. Ferrell overcomes these dramatic obstacles. Hes a serious actor as well as a fine funnyman. (Check out his performance as a charmingly foolish actor in Woody Allens ""Melinda and Melinda."") But Mr. Rushs film functions for the most part in such a narrow emotional range--from sad through mournful to lugubrious with surprisingly few side trips to anger--that you keep rooting for its star to lighten up which he eventually does when its almost too late. From time to time the movie grabs you (though the music keeps repelling you). Taking stock and letting go--of superfluous things of worn-out love--is a strong theme. But the progression of the script is like Nicks self-help program. Were familiar with the steps. DVD FOCUS Knocked Up (2007) Judd Apatow has already had huge success as a writer-director as well as a producer in mating crowd-pleasing raunchiness with a generous spirit and genuine feeling. In this hit comedy the slob hero played by Seth Rogen hooks up at a bar with a gorgeous blonde played by Katherine Heigl. A few weeks after their drunken encounter (which is much more plausible than it sounds) shes pregnant and hes dumbfounded. But the movie which also features Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd is more than a celebration of slobness. Of all things its a paean to family values. Brick (2005) Joseph Gordon-Levitt is Brendan a teenage detective in Rian Johnsons clever parody of film noir thats set in a contemporary California high school. Mr. Johnson has done his homework and he applies the lessons of the film-noir genre with a lively appreciation for atmosphere--Steve Yedlin did the elegant cinematography--and for the pleasures of film-culture clash. (""Bugsy Malone"" meets ""The Big Sleep."") Yet the principle is basically a distancing device--look at us here but imagine us being somewhere else--and the distance grows as the film rolls on. Talladega Nights The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006) When Will Ferrell plays funny few funnymen are funnier. After a wreck on a Nascar track Mr. Ferrells faux-legendary driver flees his car arms flailing wildly convinced that hes on fire. He isnt but the movie is. This mock-epic send-up of the inspirational sports-movie genre directed by Adam McKay from a script he and Mr. Ferrell wrote burns with a comic intensity that seems too high to be sustainable. Against all odds though the filmmaker and his exuberant cast pull it off right down to a ""Chariots of Fire"" climax. The cast includes Sacha Baron Cohen and John C. Reilly.

Starring Rebecca Hall Will Ferrell Director Dan Rush Running time 140 Release Opened May 13 2011  Editorial Review Its no laughing matter for FerrellBy Michael OSullivanFriday May 13 2011""Everything Must Go"" is a movie about a yard sale the way Chekhovs ""The Cherry Orchard"" is a play about a real estate auction. Both statements are true but they tell only half the story.Based on the short story ""Why Dont You Dance"" by Raymond Carver -- that late great master of literary alienation and loneliness -- ""Everything Must Go"" has been described somewhat tentatively as a ""dramedy."" And it does star Will Ferrell. But despite a trailer that makes it look like a yuk-fest the laughs are few and far between.Thats okay. Chekhov thought ""The Cherry Orchard"" was a comedy too.You dont get laugh-out-loud funny in Raymond Carver whose works were previously (and most prominently) brought to the screen by Robert Altman in the 1993 film ""Short Cuts."" Here as adapted by first-time feature filmmaker Dan Rush Carver brings us the tale of an alcoholic named Nick Halsey (Ferrell) who in the space of 24 hours loses his job his wife his house his bank account and his bearings. Some humor is okay -- and inevitable -- as when Nick uses the pocketknife with his name on it that he has been given by his company as a parting gift to puncture the tire of his bosss car. The blade gets stuck and the look of impotent panic on Nicks face is classic Ferrell. Dont get used to it. That chuckle which comes early in the film is not a harbinger of things to come.Instead were treated to the spectacle of Nick who has been locked out of his home by his wife -- and whose every possession has been unceremoniously dumped on the front lawn before she left -- essentially living al fresco in his old recliner as he guzzles beer after beer after beer from a nearby cooler. Theres a certain desperate absurdity to that along with a lot of pain. But comic it aint. Surprisingly Ferrell underplays it nicely neither milking Nicks misfortunes for laughs nor asking for our pity. Its funny -- and not in a ha-ha way -- but there really isnt much difference between what we see the actor doing here and what he has always done at least in some of his more deadpan comedy roles. The shift in tone is subtle but appropriate. It may take a while for some viewers to come around but Ferrell pushes the semi-serious character he played in the 2006 ""Stranger Than Fiction"" -- an IRS auditor confronted with the big issues of life love and death -- to a whole new level of straight-faced drama. Nicest of all is the way that Ferrell and Rush render Nicks relationships. Theres Kenny (Christopher Jordan Wallace) a lonely latch-key kid who keeps hanging around Nicks yard. Theres Samantha (Rebecca Hall) a lonely pregnant neighbor. Theres Delilah (Laura Dern) a former high-school crush whom Nick looks up. And theres Frank (Michael Pena) Nicks Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor who tries to nudge him back on the wagon. In one way or another they all represent the loneliness that comes with being human and the lost opportunities that each of us must accept and move past.If it sounds wholly bleak it isnt. Remember this is a movie about a yard sale. Over the course of the film Nick struggles with the idea of as he puts it ""selling all my crap"" -- he means that both literally and metaphorically -- and getting on with his life. That sentiment and Ferrells refusal to sentimentalize it is reason enough to smile. Contains obscenity and a brief sex scene.

""Everything Must Go"" is cinematic pointilism. The big picture is famil iar -- busted middle-age man suburban alcoholic despair -- yet the details are so finely rendered that the overall impression is potently strange. Returning home from work after being fired as a salesman in Arizona Nick Halsey (Will Ferrell) finds his wife gone the locks changed and his possessions splattered across the front lawn. His ATM and credit cards dont work. So he sits in the lounge-turned-lawn chair pops himself a beer or 20 and broods. Looking bleary and remote Will Ferrell draws a deep breath and takes a big step forward as a dramatic actor in a sharply funny adaptation of Raymond Carvers short story ""Why Dont You Dance"" greatly expanded by first-time writer director Dan Rush with nuance and sensitivity. The standard Hollywood riff on the suburbs -- that their sterility masks their depravity -- becomes more of a minor-key melody here. Ferrell and Rush arent driven by contempt or scorn and they balance the everyday against the absurd almost as wonderfully as the other notable Carver-inspired movie ""Short Cuts."" Kenny a neighborhood kid (an excellent Christopher Jordan Wallace son of the late Biggie Smalls) circles endlessly more out of boredom than to be a pest. Facing arrest though Nick gets a reprieve from a detective who tells him he can stay at home for up to five days provided he has a lawn sale. So Nick hires the kid to help sell. The movie consistently swerves around expectation. Theres a pretty new neighbor Samantha (Rebecca Hall) but shes married and pregnant so there is no question of her being Nicks saving angel. Mostly the movie passes in whispers as Nick tries to clean up his life. Its easy to picture say Tim Robbins playing the character as a maximum oaf but Nicks acute lack of sentimentality slowly emerges. If he werent so honest with himself he wouldnt need to drink. When Samantha tells him his father sounds like an interesting guy he replies ""Yeah he was more of a drunk."" Weary despair does not prevent him from instantly sizing up whats wrong with Samanthas marriage. The idea of commerce as a purgatory of the lost dates back at least to Willy Loman but in a refreshing twist selling helps restore Nick. The lawn sale creates a community brings judgmental neighbors out from behind their curtains inspires random kindness. As de Tocqueville wrote ""Trade loves moderation delights in compromise and is most careful to avoid anger."" Consider this film a smart delayed response to Arthur Miller Its ""Rebirth of a Salesman."" kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Ashton Kutcher will replace Charlie Sheen on Two and a Ha...

(AP Photo/Roadside Attractions John Estes) John Estes In this publicity image released by Roadside Attractions Laura Dern left and Will Ferrell is shown in a scene from ""Everything Must Go."" (AP Photo/Roadside Attractions John Estes) Like a lot of movie comedians Will Ferrell has gotten famous from playing jerks. But what distinguishes Ferrells comedy is that his blowhard characters are usually the butt of the joke clueless about their own faults. Ferrell hones his craft in ""Everything Must Go"" a midlife meltdown dramedy that has the focus of a fine short story.Thats because its based on a story by Raymond Carver the minimalist balladeer of the once-great American male. The everyman is Nick Halsey a salesman who is fired for being a drunk douses his shame with a 12-pack and arrives at his Phoenix home to find all his belongings strewn on the lawn. His wife has changed the locks and frozen the bank account.With nowhere to go Nick settles into his La-Z-Boy recliner and contemplates the burning question of where hell get his next beer. When a detective who also happens to be his AA sponsor (Michael Pena) warns Nick that hes got three days to dispose of all the junk Nick enlists a local kid named Kenny (Christopher Jordan Wallace) to help with a yard sale.Its an effectively simple storytelling device to have a fallen man sort through the wreckage of his life while he imparts his professional sales expertise to a surrogate son. Nick develops a touchingly frank rapport with Kenny and with Samantha (Rebecca Hall) a pretty new neighbor who may or may not have been ditched by the same kind of corporate husband. But notwithstanding the ironies to be gleaned from outdated clothes rusted sports trophies and treasured Playboy magazines this is only a comedy in the faintest sense of the word. Ferrells dryly understated performance is a shorthand for an alcoholics denial and repressed rage and as Nick grows increasingly desperate for a drink he keeps his anger stashed like a last beer for emergencies.

"""Everything Must Go"" Movie review of ""Everything Must Go"" - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-LifeMovie review Everything Must GoWill Ferrell is a revelation playing against type as a muddled man whose life has collapsed around him leaving him to choose whether to be buried by the wreckage or to dig his way out.May 13 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Will Ferrell as Nick Halsey in ""Everything Must Go."" (John Estes / Roadside Attractions...)With a bruised and nearly broken Will Ferrell in a Barcalounger presiding over a yard sale of all his worldly possessions ""Everything Must Go"" is like the Raymond Carver short story it is loosely based on a a precision cut at an already small slice of life. Years ago Carver examined a day in four pages in ""Why Dont You Dance."" Dan Rush making his feature writing/directing debut expands the state of play by a week adds a few characters and a back story and creates a moving snapshot of modern-day angst. In this low-budget character-driven indie Ferrell steps out of type to play Nick Halsey a very muddled man. On the day we meet him hes a top executive getting fired for the latest alcohol-fueled incident with a female client. After working out some of his frustration on the tires of the guy who axed him Nick stocks up on booze and then heads to his house in the burbs only to find the wife has left him the locks have been changed and his stuff is on the front lawn. Life to say the least is a mess. Life also wont let him alone. Theres the new neighbor moving in across the street a very pregnant fine-art photographer named Samantha (Rebecca Hall). There is a latchkey kid Kenny (Christopher Jordan Wallace) whos biking back and forth as he considers Nicks condition. There are the random strangers who stop by to pick through the stuff Nick is not yet ready to sell. And theres his AA sponsor Det. Frank Garcia (Michael PeA+-a) who buys him a few days to take his stuff and his life somewhere else before vagrancy laws kick in. Within the casual exchanges that come from these very basic human interactions we begin to piece together what happened to Nick. It is a tribute to the sophistication of Rushs script that Nick does too. The question is whether Nick will be able to shed his past a literally and figuratively a and if that will be enough to enable him to start a new and different life. The test in a sense is the same for Ferrell. Hes made a career of playing the bumbling fool failing upward in hits such as ""Anchorman The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" and ""Talladega Nights The Ballad of Ricky Bobby."" But he has a worriers face behind that rubber-band grin a it was exposed somewhat in 2006s ""Stranger Than Fiction"" as an ordinary guy whose fate was suddenly in the hands of Emma Thompsons novelist who had his murder in mind. But passive reactive worry is a different beast than active resentment and regret which is what ""Everything Must Go"" demands. Ferrell finds all of that and more in his most emotionally naked performance yet (the post-party streaking scene in ""Old School"" notwithstanding). He is helped by the steady hand Rush displays. The filmmaker has spent about a decade as a commercial director for high-end clients a craft that requires 30- 60- and 90-second sprints. He slows down for ""Everything Must Go"" with cinematographer Michael Barrett (""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" ""Bobby"") keeping everything at the right scale a intimate without being claustrophobic. The cast Rush has assembled around Ferrell helps as well. There are tiny gems contributed by Laura Dern as the long-lost high school crush Nick looks up and Stephen Root as a prickly neighbor with some unusual proclivities. More central to Nicks evolving psyche is Halls Samantha. The British actress consistently creates thoughtful and careful characters. In Samantha shes a bit of empathy in an unforgiving world and you can see Nicks mood shift when shes around. PeA+-a keeps finding his way into small parts that he expands just by stepping into the frame making Frank human in unexpected ways. But the heart of the film hangs on the relationship between Nick and Kenny essentially a kid whos been left to his own devices a very nice turn by the son of the late rapper Notorious B.I.G. You can see in their insolence the quiet desperation the need for connection the unwillingness to admit it. And the humor to be found in the fundamental ironies of life. No great epiphanies just a few days a little perspective nicely told. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESBurt Wonderstone Has Carell made the most of...March 18 2013Movie review The Campaign follows winning strategyAugust 9 2012Movie review MegamindNovember 5 2010Everything Must Go director gets in under the wireSeptember 11 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTLifeCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-everything-must-go-20110513,0,6536491.story",200,everythingmustgo8,everythingmustgo,latimes

Photo John Estes Roadside Attractions Everything Must Go review Success with failure 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Everything Must Go Drama. Starring Will Ferrell Rebecca Hall and Laura Dern. Directed by Dan Rush. (R. 106 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In ""Everything Must Go"" we find Will Ferrell in his first dramatic role and he has just enough going on that we can welcome this change of pace as the beginning of something interesting. Ferrell has a good look for drama in that hes a type common in life but not often seen in movies - a big guy who looks weaker for being big whose power seems diffused over space like one of those vegetable-eating dinosaurs that get devoured by velociraptors. When he keeps a straight face he no longer looks above it all but disconnected from all the smaller busier people who are running things and who are about to run right over him. The demolition starts from the opening sequence in which Ferrell as a business executive gets fired from his longtime job for being an alcoholic - but probably also for being middle-aged and commanding a big salary. So he goes home and thats when he discovers that his wife is gone the locks have been changed and everything he owns is on his front lawn including his lounge chair. He sits down on it and resolves not to budge. And thats about what we see in ""Everything Must Go"" a man sitting on a couch sometimes drinking sometimes white-knuckling it. He talks to the young married woman (Rebecca Hall) across the street who has her own thinly concealed sorrows. He makes friends with a neighborhood kid who helps him organize a yard sale. And he thinks and tries not to think about how he ended up addicted and burnt out in middle age. This is a difficult role. With little external action the drama has to take place inside the character. This leaves Ferrell with enormous spaces to fill and he cant quite fill them. He lacks and has always lacked a tragic consciousness. Robin Williams has one - it has been well used and ill used but he has it. Chaplin had it. In their own weird way Jerry Lewis and Jim Carrey have it. But Ferrell has never seemed fundamentally screwed up and so we dont receive this drama as a chance to look into him with fascination. He cant give us a labyrinth of pain and turbulence just a regular guy in trouble. Related Stories Everything Must Go ""Everything Must Go"" is based on a Raymond Carver short story (""Why Dont You Dance"") and at times feels like something short that has been stretched beyond its natural limits. There are too many somber interludes with nothing going on but an acoustic guitar echoing over the soundtrack the spareness of the score suggesting the emptiness of the characters lives. Yet though Ferrell may not be the most arresting consciousness to showcase he is throughout a sympathetic focus for a movie that is really about something that all Americans either know or fear or try to push away which is failure. Things happen. Sometimes people end up back at square one and its not their fault. Sometimes it is their fault but thats no less painful. There are complications disappointments. The bottom falls out and people land in the middle of their lives with nothing around but bleached-out bones and tumbleweeds. This is where Ferrells average-guy look comes in handy. ""Everything Must Go"" is supposed to be about one person but in a bad economy an audiences capacity for empathy becomes a beautiful thing. Everything can go. Sometimes it does go. The movie tells a pertinent story about what happens next. -- Advisory This film contains strong language and sexual content. E-mail Mick LaSalle at mlasallesfchronicle.com.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint They didnt make it easy on themselves. The makers of ""Everything Must Go"" took a story by Raymond Carver the bard of unhappy marriage booze and workingmans gloom and turned it into a Will Ferrell vehicle. It sounds like an example of Hindenberg-level bad judgment but the tragicomic movie works surprisingly well. Ferrell displays considerable dramatic chops acting the part of a free-falling alcoholic with immense sympathy but no sentimentality. If you are a fan of Ferrells comic performances see this film and experience the joy of having your boundaries broadened. If you arent watch this restrained performance and prepare to start thinking about him as a low-key subtle completely real dramatic actor. Ferrell plays Nick Halsey a Phoenix sales executive whom we meet on the most terrible day of his life. Fired over accusations of sexual harassment he returns to his suburban home to find his wife gone the locks changed his bank account frozen and all his belongings strewn on the front lawn. Nicks response is to relapse into his recliner and work his way through several six-packs. A smug neighbor (Stephen Root) swings by to advise him it was only a matter of time. A lonely boy on a bike (Christopher Wallace Jr. son of the late Brooklyn rap legend Biggie Smalls) stops by to ask why Nick is living outdoors. Nick has a few tentative exchanges with his new neighbor (Rebecca Hall) a pregnant photographer setting up house in advance of her husbands arrival. Nick is too withdrawn and angry to forge close relationships with these newcomers but they offer small moments of consolation. In a gem of a scene thats both awkward and humane he visits an old high school friend (Laura Dern) and they discuss the wrong turns that brought each of them to their present crossroads. As Nicks petty humiliations pile up and his temper frays Ferrell lets us glimpse the rage that hides behind many a comedians mask. His frustration when the clerk at his local convenience store wont let him have a free beer is scalding; Nick is not a guy you want to get into an altercation with. John Estes Roadside Attractions Funny man Will Ferrell displays considerable acting chops by playing a free-falling alcoholic in the drama ""Everything Must Go."" There are a few flickers of humor notably Nicks encounters with automated lawn sprinklers but theyre unforced and over quickly. One of the greatest achievements of ""Everything Must Go"" is writer/director Dan Rushs knack for using images that have the heft and resonance of metaphor but which genuinely fit into the story as just another element of everyday life. When Nick takes to his swimming pool drifting aimlessly on a floating lounger with a beer in hand its an indelible image of a man unmoored. Will Ferrell is evolving as an artist.

"Toned-down Ferrell sells Everything Must Go - USATODAY.com Skip to Main Content USA TODAY Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather Toned-down Ferrell sells Everything Must Go By Scott Bowles USA TODAY Updated | | Share Reprints amp; Permissions If he isnt careful Will Ferrell is going to become a bona fide actor. By John Estes Roadside Attractions Will Ferrell stars as Nick Halsey a man who tries to sell everything after his wife throws everything out of the house. EnlargeClose By John Estes Roadside Attractions Will Ferrell stars as Nick Halsey a man who tries to sell everything after his wife throws everything out of the house. The loudmouthed comedian isnt there yet. Hes still more at ease clowning in his underpants than shedding a tear. But with his restrained turn in Everything Must Go Ferrell is demonstrating the understated chops that made colleagues Robin Williams and Jim Carrey jack-of-all-trade entertainers. Ferrell plays Nick Halsey a salesman whose career is slowing but whose drinking has not. After losing his job Halsey comes home to find his belongings on the front lawn the locks changed and his wife gone having filed for divorce. The film touches on what got Nick in this mess -- he fell off the wagon and into bed with another woman -- but it makes only glancing references to the infractions. Based on the short story Why Dont You Dance by Raymond Carver Everything shies from the bombastic confrontations of many tales of addiction. If anything first-time filmmaker Dan Rush who wrote the script has made a film so subtle that it borders on the laconic. The setup -- after discovering his evicted items Nick camps on his front lawn and puts his belongings up for sale -- could have been fodder for Ferrell to become the Everyman Jackass he has played so well before. About the movie Everything Must Go    out of fourStars Will Ferrell Rebecca Hall Laura Dern Director Dan Rush Distributor Roadside Attractions Rating R for language and some sexual content Running time 1 hour 40 minutes Opens in select cities Friday Here though Rush keeps Ferrells sharp tongue nearly mute as he encounters a parade of neighbors he barely remembers let alone knows. We meet the pregnant Samantha (Rebecca Hall) whose husband has traits disturbingly similar to Nicks. Kenny (the wonderful Christopher Jordan Wallace) offers to help with the yard sale in which Nick hopes to unload everything from his past including booze. Its a fine line that Rush walks one that doesnt always work. Everything can careen from sobering to silly so quickly that its hard to keep up. The relationship with Samantha rings a little Hollywood-esque. The film finds surer footing in the relationship between Nick and Christopher. Rush gives Christopher the right mix of savvy and naivete to make him believable as a boy learning (along with his dazed neighbor) how to function in public. As he did in Stranger Than Fiction Ferrell displays surprising range when he ratchets down the volume. And he cant help it in this picture where there are no villains heroes or seismic changes in worldview. Instead we get an utterly restrained portrait of a man hoping to sell off his worldly goods along with his past. Most of it is worth the purchase.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + In ""Everything Must Go Will Ferrell signals hes giving a dramatic performance by limiting himself to one facial expression and rarely lifting his voice above a standing crouch. Serious business. Hes playing a loser Nick Halsey whose alcoholism has cost him his sales job and his wife on the same day but because Ferrell has become a very rich man playing comical screw-ups -- big flabby blowhards who barge into things -- you keep finding reasons to snicker. Its as if the class clown had decided to read us his love poetry.Unfair? Maybe but ""Everything Must Go makes it hard for its star to try a changeup. A minor-key suburban parable based (very loosely) on a Raymond Carver short story Dan Rushs debut film is sweet but slack despite having a nearly foolproof setup. Nick returns home after being let go at work to find the locks changed his wife gone and every one of his belongings laid out on the front yard. Soon his cellphone and car both corporate property have been repossessed. Within a matter of hours he has ceased to exist as a functioning member of society.Worse Nicks shame is there for all to see right out on the front lawn. His response is to hunker down in the La-Z-Boy start drinking early and often and hold a sort of existential yard sale. His neighbor (Stephen Root) is appalled his AA sponsor (Michael Pena) despondent. The pregnant newlywed (Rebecca Hall) who just moved in across the street is merely nonplussed. ""Im no different than any of you Nick tells her as he sucks down his eighth beer. ""I just dont hide in my house.""Everything Must Go takes place over five days that chart the ebb and flow of its heros misfortunes. Theres a deadpan young black kid (Christopher Jordan Wallace) who becomes Nicks best salesman and protector. Theres a visit to a high school acquaintance (Laura Dern) bearing up under her own disappointments. The pregnant newlywed has problems too since her unseen husband is resisting relocation and right there the movie lost me because what man in his right mind abandons Rebecca Hall?The attention to detail in that driveway is satisfyingly precise though. Nicks bric-a-brac reflects all the things we collect and try to call a life saxophones and foosball tables exercisers and stuffed coyotes trophies and Viewmasters and a baseball signed by the 78 Yankees. The impulse to give it all away -- sell everything become nothing be reborn -- is both noble and suicidal but the star fails to convince us of either extreme. Just because Nicks a little man doesnt mean this has to be a little performance but that sadly is what we get from Ferrell.A comparison to Carvers original story -- called ""Why Dont You Dance? easily Googleable and all of 1600 words long -- is instructive. Without mentioning the main characters marital problems or even giving him a name Carver zeroes in on a bleakness and a comfort with that bleakness thats mysterious and profound. ""Everything Must Go tells us much more and gives us much less backstory sentiment closure. It lives up to its title in ways its maker never intended.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday May 12 2011 409 PM Title Everything Must Go It wont be easy to approach ""Everything Must Go"" without any preconceived notions. Still even if you enter thinking of it as ""the serious Will Ferrell movie"" expect to leave the theater talking about ""Dan Rushs potent tragicomic directorial debut.""Or maybe not. No matter what this is still a Ferrell film--he is after all center stage from start to end. And he has such a concrete presence that its impossible to forget were watching him. But hes so good as a dramatic lead youll definitely wonder why hes hidden this side of himself for so long. Theres certainly nothing amusing about the state of affairs facing his character Nick an alcoholic whos just lost his job. Making the miserable impossible he comes home to find his wife gone the locks changed and everything he owns on the lawn. Oh and his cars been repossessed.With no other options Nick starts living in his front yard. Though hardly ideal this arrangement does at least present some new social opportunities. He meets his pregnant neighbor Samantha (Rebecca Hall) and begins a friendship with a lonely boy named Kenny (Christopher Jordan Wallace). Samantha helps him realize hes hit bottom and Kenny inspires him to start working his way up. The first step is to get rid of all his stuff in a massive tag sale. After that . . . well one step at a time.Rush didnt so much adapt the brief Raymond Carver story ""Why Dont You Dance"" as take inspiration from its bleak vision of middle age. He then expanded and softened it just a bit with recognizable signposts (though all well played none of the symbolic supporting characters feel real).In truth this would be rather familiar indie fare without its perfectly-cast star who fearlessly alternates between bitter humor aggressive desperation and gentle helplessness. Just like Adam Sandlers edgy turn in 2002s ""Punch-Drunk Love"" Ferrells performance starts out looking like an experiment only to reveal unexpected artistry. Eventually were forced to abandon our own baggage and see things in a brand-new way. Dont Miss As a neighbor with some surprising kinks Stephen Root offers a few fearless moments of his own.

Share Tweet Based on a Raymond Carver short story Everything Must Go stars Will Ferrell as an alcoholic who loses his job then comes home to find that his wife has dumped all his stuff on the lawn changed the locks and frozen all his accounts. So Ferrell buys some beer plops down in his easy chair and proceeds to live in his yard for the next five days while holding a little sale. Meanwhile he converses with the people who pass by concerned policeman (and Ferrells AA sponsor) Michael Pena; pregnant neighbor Rebecca Hall who has a straying husband of her own; and pudgy kid Christopher Jordan Wallace who becomes Ferrells assistant salesman. Writer-director Dan Rush couldve approached this material in dozens of ways but the way he chooses--turning it into an occasionally wry ever-earnest dramedy--is precisely the wrong one. Nearly everything about the movie is standard-issue indie from the plunky soundtrack to the procession of quirky and/or achingly sensitive supporting characters (many of them played by recognizable faces like Glenn Howerton Stephen Root and Laura Dern getting in a few days work). Even the comic moments follow form; this is the kind of movie where if Ferrell tells Wallace ""I dont need to borrow your bike"" the next shot will inevitably be of him pedaling away. Theres nothing egregiously awful about Everything Must Go. The premise is inherently engaging the cast is strong and it has moments of fleeting poignancy and wit. But theres nothing surprising or edgy about the movie either--no wild energy or penetrating insight. Its only natural that a comedian like Ferrell would want to challenge himself by occasionally taking on dramatic roles but honestly Everything Must Go wouldve been a much better movie if it had been more like Talladega Nights than Sunshine Cleaning.

More by Steven Rea Introducing Phillys Maris Curran director of Five Nights in Maine Jul 29 Weekend Movie Selections Jul 30 Bad Moms Mila Kunis and writers from The Hangover skewer the mommy wars raunchily Jul 29 Big comedy stars tend to tamp down and clam up when they go ""serious"" in movies and it doesnt always work. In dramatic roles they can get hushed and self-conscious suppressing the instinct for frenetic free-form riffing or goofball shtick - as if they might suddenly explode and mess the whole thing up. More about Everything Must Go >> Its to Will Ferrells credit then and to Dan Rush the filmmaker whose idea it was to hire him that the actor and his character sync up perfectly in Everything Must Go. The doofus clown of Step Brothers and Talladega Nights is gone but Nick Halsey the Arizona sales exec whos just lost his job and been tossed out of his house by his wife - whos leaving him - still manages to crack a smile. Admittedly hes also cracking open cases of Pabst Blue Ribbon. The guys in AA and his last six months of sobriety come to an end as his life falls apart. Adapted from Raymond Carvers short story ""Why Dont You Dance"" Everything Must Go is a sharply drawn study of down-and-outness that dovetails neatly alas with the Great Recession fallout thats raining across the land. George Clooneys Up in the Air downsizing consultant isnt brought in to fire Ferrells Halsey but the same feeling that the boom times have passed that the days of flush credit and McMansion mortgages are over permeates the air. And so what happens as Halsey staggers across the office parking lot with his two allotted boxes of personal belongings is this He drives to a minimart buys some booze and returns home where he finds his possessions - his La-Z-Boy recliner his baseball memorabilia his barbecue grill his vinyl collection - strewn on the front lawn. A kid hes never seen before (Christopher Jordan Wallace in a beautifully unself-conscious turn) rolls up and starts talking. Halsey is wary at first and in no mood to befriend some pudgy preteen but Kenny has issues of rejection and fear and self-doubt too and a bond develops. And then the idea to have a yard sale and get rid of all this stuff is born. Rebecca Hall the English actress who plays American (in The Town in Vicky Cristina Barcelona) with seeming ease - and with a seductively melancholy vibe - shows up as a New Yorker just moved in across the street waiting for her husband to arrive and for the imminent arrival of her first child. Halls Samantha and Ferrells character meet and talk and as often happens with strangers rather than with intimates deep concerns and confessions are shared. Theres an amazing scene with the two of them camped on the grass in the night when Halsey bitter and drunk lashes into her her marriage and absentee spouse. Likewise Ferrell brings palpable hurt and emotional confusion to an encounter with a girl he knew in high school (Laura Dern) and who he tracks down in a moment of desperate loneliness after riffling through his old yearbook and seeing a note she left. Rush a commercials director making his feature debut gets some incredible work out of Ferrell and his cast here. These scenes have a poignancy and grace thats unexpected. Poignancy grace Will Ferrell - see what I mean? Everything Must Go is a small film not the tricky Hollywood concept of his heretofore more substantial work in Stranger Than Fiction. This is an indie film with big stars - but also an indie films with big ideas about bringing real people to life. Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Everything Must Go Spotlight Will Ferrel Good to great Director Dan Rush. Cast Will Ferrell Rebecca Hall Christopher Jordan Wallace. Rating Rated R for language and some sexual content. >> Ferrell wins top Mark Twain humor prize Yes hes hilarious in things like ""Old School"" and ""Anchorman"" but when he makes films like ""Land of the Lost"" or ""Semi-Pro"" you start to wonder as you watch yet another befuddled character deal with the world around him cant this guy do anything else? Turns out he can and he can do it very well. In ""Everything Must Go"" director Dan Rushs adaptation of the Raymond Carver short story ""Why Dont You Dance"" Ferrell is outstanding as another type of character struggling to deal with the world - an alcoholic salesman who loses his job and comes home to find his wife gone and all of his possessions on the front lawn. Ferrell mines some of the situations for comedy. His seems to be a sort of whimsical brand of alcoholism at first for instance though the seriousness of his problem will become more and more evident as time goes on. Its a genuinely unexpected performance one of those things that you never would have predicted but once you see it you realize its perfect. Who knew? (Perhaps the few people who saw ""Stranger Than Fiction"" but no one else.) Ferrell plays Nick Halsey a salesman living in Phoenix. One day he is called into his boss office. The company is going in a different direction hes told which is obvious code for Youre fired. Nick argues that his drinking is under control but there are ominous references to an incident on a trip to Denver. A little parking-lot vandalism follows and soon Nick pulls into his driveway without a job only to see everything that belongs to him everything that he brought to his home strewn about his front yard. Among many other things there are records his DJ father had a set of samurai swords (actually made in China) a recliner and to his great delight a mini fridge that will keep the copious amounts of Pabst Blue Ribbon he has purchased cold. Hell just live here in the yard Nick figures. But the police have different ideas. Only Frank (Michael Pena) a detective friend keeps him out of serious trouble. Frank is also Nicks Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor and understands his struggle even better than Nick realizes. Kenny (Christopher Jordan Wallace son of Notorious B.I.G. and fantastic) a lonely kid who bikes around the neighborhood agrees to help Nick label everything and make signs for a giant yard sale that is to go on for as long as it takes to get rid of everything in exchange for a small cut of the profits and some baseball lessons. Meanwhile Samantha (Rebecca Hall) the pregnant woman who moved in across the street ahead of the arrival of her husband offers a sympathetic ear giving Rush an opportunity to detail Nicks troubles. Nick drinks constantly even while showering out back by the pool (he has to kick down the gate to get there because his wife had all the locks changed). As with most drunks he will prove volatile and inconsistent in his relationships; even someone as sweet and patient as Samantha has her limits. Nick also finds an old high-school yearbook which leads to a visit with an old classmate (Laura Dern heartbreakingly good in a small role loaded with hints of touching disappointment). You had a good heart she tells Nick and that doesnt change. You hope that shes right. More than that really. Ferrells performance - all of the performances in fact - is so poignant that you could hardly bear otherwise. Nick needs another chance. Maybe hell get one. Maybe he wont. Its up to him ultimately. ""Everything Must Go"" leaves the resolution open not telegraphing Nicks future. It is as unsettled as life and the film is all the better for it.

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe Movies Everything Must Go Will Ferrell at Home in Carver Country The comedy superstar takes a serious turn in a melancholy new drama By Mary Pols MaryPolsMay 09 2011 Share Read Later John Estes / Roadside Attractions / APWill Ferrell in Everything Must Go Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture The new Will Ferrell movie Everything Must Go is based on a typically sparse and despairing story by Raymond Carver called Why Dont You Dance? Since he specialized in knowing gloom what we talk about when we talk about Carver does not usually include fun comedy or glee--which is what we usually talk about when we talk about Ferrell. But Ferrell fits uncannily well into Carver country and in this small but sturdy film he challenges any assumption that he might be limited to comedy. Certainly this is the first time hes moved me to tears that werent produced by hard laughter. The original Carver story is very short only 1620 words. A man surveys his front lawn covered with furniture. A young couple wanders by and assuming a yard sale begin to shop. The man is agreeable and offers them whiskey. Carver lets us know that the man used to share the bed with a now-absent wife but his reasons for lawn living are never explained and Why Dont You Dance? is punctuated by more question marks than the one at the end of the title. In Everything Must Go first-time writer-director Dan Rush takes the same situation--a heavy drinker living on his lawn--and answers the outstanding questions. He gives the man a name (Nick Halsey) a profession (just-fired marketing executive) and a clear diagnosis (lapsed recovering alcoholic). By providing a hopeful resolution Rush alleviates some of Carvers despair but this is still the essentially melancholy story of a man cast from suburban comforts into a position of sudden very public humiliation. As Nicks AA sponsor and his lone friend Frank (Michael Pena) puts it Nicks life is ""so damn sad."" (Will Ferrell Grows Up) Any good comedian is by necessity well-acquainted with the vulnerability of humiliation so its not surprising that Ferrell can tap effectively into the agony of Nicks nakedness before the world. In addition to moving his worldly goods--most of them toys for manly recreation--to the lawn his wife has changed the locks and frozen their bank accounts. When the cash in his wallet runs out he cant even buy beer. But Ferrell goes deeper; Nick gradually confronts the reasons for his arrival at rock bottom. While his wife never appears on screen the visual evidence of her rage in the form of the expelled furniture; her refusal to answer Nicks calls reinforces the sense that his screw-ups are not to be taken lightly. Nick isnt the kind of cute messy puppy Ferrell has so often played (in movies like Old School and Elf). Nick is far from loveable. Even when he is leaving unduly sweet voice mails for his wife a storm hovers on Ferrells brow; when his porcine eyes arent dull or hazed with alcohol they seem mean. Signs of at least a materially good life is there but so is a corruption of spirit. In the beginning of the film the novelty of Ferrell playing it straight kept me rapt--when is he going to crack a joke?--but what held me in place was a curiosity about how Nick would react and adapt to the havoc he had wreaked in his own life. The foils Rush added carefully and respectfully to expand Carvers story in the shape of friends and neighbors only increased that interest. Theres a disapproving neighbor (Stephen Root giving comic relief) a lonely overweight kid (Christopher Jordan Wallace) who wants Nick to teach him how to play baseball an old high school classmate (Laura Dern doing as usual a lot with a little) and finally a pregnant woman (Rebecca Hall) who just moved in across the street. Everything about Halls character suggests freshness and possibility but not--thankfully--in a romantic sense. Her Samantha is someone a man would like to look his best for but at the same time the person most likely to have compassion for a drunk lolling on his recliner in his front yard. In her previous films The Town and Please Give Hall also embodied saviors who were more than just saintly; her eyes always hint at the anticipation of mischief and joy. (Read about Raymond Carver) It might seem that it takes enormous bravery or arrogance for a first-time filmmaker to adapt the revered Carver. When Robert Altman did it he was a veteran director well-revered himself and he used nine Carver stories and one poem as the basis for Short Cuts (1993). But it is actually a wonder more filmmakers dont flock to Carver. His scaffolding is so beautiful and reliable; its like buying an old house to renovate rather than designing your own. In the last line of Why Dont You Dance? the girl from the yard sale is still trying to puzzle out what was going on with the man ""There was more to it and she was trying to get it talked out. After a time she quit trying."" Rush succeeds where she failed; he gets at the ""more"" there talks it out and makes sense of it. Then as the Bands version of ""I Shall Be Released"" swells on the soundtrack (does this ballad ever fall to induce hope?) he quietly gives Nick a chance to move forward. Though very different from Carvers deliberately unfathomed ending the way Everything Must Go answers Carvers invitation to the reader--to project as he or she pleases--is a tribute of another sort. And while Carver was not the sort to have his old dogs learn new tricks I have a hunch hed have enjoyed seeing Ferrell such a strapping quintessentially American performer take a dramatic risk and succeed.

Comments click to enlarge Everything Must Go Video Rated R  97 minutes  2011 Raymond Carvers short-short story ""Why Dont You Dance?"" was a characteristically poker-faced tale about an alcoholic whos arranged all his furniture and belongings on the front lawn of his suburban home. To expand it into this low-key comic drama writer-director Dan Rush has sketched in the presumed details (the mans wife has left him) added a rickety story arc (shes locked him out and canceled his credit cards leaving him no option but to raise cash through a yard sale) and tossed in a few standard-issue supporting characters (a lonely fat kid who befriends the guy an unhappy housewife across the street). As the phlegmatic beer-guzzling protagonist Will Ferrell manages to keep this rolling though Rushs corny narrative devices (each of the minor characters receives an ironic gift at the end) couldnt be less consistent with Carvers stubborn minimalism.

His stern preternaturally distant gaze and burly physique take on an ironic quality when pitted against the clumsy characters he does best. As a result he always looks poised to deliver a joke. Over the years he has channeled those intrinsic comic features into a wide range of deadpan roles generally doing justice to the persona even when the script cant keep up. But when someone like Ferrell ventures beyond his safety zone with material that lacks punchlines the disconnect drags him down. ""Everything Must Go"" marks the latest instance of this misdirection. The story in which a recently fired alcoholic comes home to find his wife has locked him out of the house and strewn his possessions across their lawn sounds ready-made for gags. Its a physically offbeat scenario based almost exclusively around Ferrells continually uneasy anti-hero Nick. The material however takes a Raymond Carver short story and plays it almost too straight. Ferrell looks uncomfortable but not amusingly so. Following the rudimentary conventions of a midlife crisis drama in which a man encounters regret and then finds new value in his life ""Everything Must Go"" features Nick pensively sitting outdoors in his lawn chair endlessly downing beer after beer and grousing about his mistakes to the smallish cast of suburban characters. His pregnant neighbor (Rebecca Hall) a new arrival to the area whose husband remains elusive initially offers her sympathies until Nick begins predicting her own marital problems. Neighborhood adolescent Kenny (Christopher Jordan Wallace who previously played a young Notorious B.I.G. in the 2009 biopic) takes a fast liking to Nick leading him to take the kid under his wing and impart his business training when the two team up to sell Nicks stuff. Meanwhile Nicks jaded sponsor (Michael Pena) keeps nudging him to move on. Naturally if he did that right away ""Everything Must Go"" would be as short as the Carver story that inspired it. Maybe it belongs that length. No given scene is particularly uneven or grueling to watch but the situational backdrop has only so much momentum. If Wikipedia is to be believed Ferrell has a net worth of 80 million which means a story this muted simply falls below the standards expected of him. Thats not to say he couldnt take on a batty character that runs counter to everything he has done before. Culture however expects big things of people who leave a dent in it. Adam Sandlers wonderfully unhinged dramatic turn in ""Punch-Drunk Love"" effectively deepened his brand (as Jim Carrey did in ""Man on the Moon"") but his pointless restraint in ""Reign Over Me"" was a waste of time. Ferrells performance in ""Everything Must Go"" doesnt sink that low as director Dan Rush guides the material with a gentle hand. Its just overwhelmingly basic a descriptor that should never apply to a comedic beast of Ferrells caliber. For my money Ferrells best roles are not onscreen but off. Along with business partner Adam McKay he kick-started the careers of Jody Hill and Danny McBride by promoting their initial collaboration the great slapstick martial arts comedy ""The Fist Foot Way."" McKay and Ferrell also launched Funny or Die a shrewd and appropriately merciless new tool for judging humor on the web. That project implied a certain perfectionist outlook on Ferrells part which may explain why he rarely stars in outright duds. If ""Everything Must Go"" were subjected to the new media tools that Ferrell helped create it would die a horrible death. Its not supposed to be funny of course but Ferrell himself is a different story. HOW WILL IT PLAY? Having generated mixed reviews since its premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival ""Everything Must Go"" will draw some curiosity from Ferrell fans before fading from view as word-of-mouth is bound to work against its initial prospects. criticWIRE grade B- This Article is related to Reviews and tagged Everything Must Go In Theaters More From IndieWireHow to Scare Yourself Shtless This Halloween A Viewers Guide (VIDEO)Exclusive Aja Naomi King Talks About Sci-Fi Thriller Reversion and the Power of Memories - Now in TheatersTwo Limited Release Films Also Opening This Weekend That You Might Be Interested in Seeing...Here Are All the Movies Opening Today January 9.

"Everything Must Go movie review by Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Ferrells stretching exercise astringently entertainingEverything Must Go a 2.5 starsMay 12 2011|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticWill Ferrell in ""Everything Must Go.""The alcoholic son of an alcoholic sales manager Nick Porter was born in a Raymond Carver short story called ""Why Dont You Dance?"" published in the 1981 Carver collection ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love."" The story which takes place at a yard sale among one mans stuff and his regrets has been expanded into ""Everything Must Go"" from debut feature film writer-director Dan Rush. Will Ferrell mining the minimalist vein he explored in ""Stranger Than Fiction"" does a valiant job in a picture that admittedly is only so big and only medium-sharp.But Ferrell acts opposite the superb Rebecca Hall (as a new and perplexed neighbor in this sunny Scottsdale Ariz. neighborhood) and Laura Dern (as a long-ago high school chum Nick visits out of the blue). Hall and Dern among others bring out something new and plaintive in Ferrell. A movie star doesnt take on a project such as ""Everything Must Go"" to make money. A star does it to become a better actor. Ferrell may appear occasionally stifled by the limited dramatic parameters here yet in flashes we see combinations traits contradictions -- funny/sad; pathetic/belligerent; watchful/numb -- that prove hes keeping his co-stars on their toes.Its the story of a bad day that turns into a five-day blur. Nick gets canned. He comes home a can of Pabst (one of many to come) in his hand to find all his belongings on the front lawn. His wife has split. The neighbor across the street played by Hall wonders whats up. A teenager rides up on a bike and soon he finds himself in Nicks employ readying the yard sale that will buy Nick some hang-out time until he determines if he wants to sober up improve his life learn a damn thing.The young actor Christopher Jordan Wallace does fine quiet work as Nicks protege; Michael Pena plays a local cop whos also Nicks AA sponsor (not a very good one). Rush respects Carvers slim vinegar-tinged story while creating new characters and new (and somewhat artificial) situations. The results go only so far. Yet already Ferrell has come a long way as a seriocomic screen presence quite apart from the movies that have ensured he can test his mettle on the occasional small-scale challenge on the order of ""Everything Must Go.""mjphillipstribune.comMPAA rating R (for language and some sexual content)Cast Will Ferrell (Nick); Rebecca Hall (Samantha); Christopher Jordan Wallace (Kenny); Michael Pena (Det.

On one rock-bottom day Nick is fired from his sales job and his wife leaves him having first changed the locks and piled all his possessions in their suburban front yard. The sight of indoor stuff splayed outdoors may be absurd. But there is nothing at all funny about the pathetic mess Nick continues to make of his life. And Ferrell whose vaguely uncomprehending onscreen stare usually signals amusing male cluelessness to come upends expectations from the very first scene as Nick sits in his car locked in a traffic standstill and palpably unable to endure the stress without a pull on his liquor flask. With characteristic physical fearlessness the actor becomes a downward-spiraling alcoholic. No joke. Its a terrific performance -- one thats unmatched by the rest of the movie written and directed by Dan Rush. Based on Raymond Carvers notable short story ""Why Dont You Dance?"" Everything Must Go is a sweetened-up padded-out scenario of hope cracking through a drunks despair. Rushs background as a director of commercials is evident in his feature-film debut Everything and everyone look 10 degrees softer and more composed than they need to be. Carvers original minimalist story goes down in two gulps The drinking guy sells his stuff to a young couple passing by. The end. Rushs adaptation skips the young couple expands the yard sale and adds a cop whos Nicks AA sponsor (Michael Pena). Theres also a lonely black kid who becomes Nicks protege (Christopher Jordan Wallace); an old high school classmate (Laura Dern in a fine subtle self-contained scene) who assures Nick that he really does have a heart; and a neighbor across the street (Rebecca Hall) whos pregnant. Despite Nicks worst hurtful behavior toward her shes willing to extend a kind of forgiveness. Ferrell for his part looks like he would have no problem going even deeper and darker than Rush could bear. Like Bill Murray and Greg Kinnear before him this funnyman reveals serious acting chops. B?

By Anthony Lane Rebecca Hall and Will Ferrell in a film based on a Raymond Carver story.   Credit Illustration by ANDY FRIEDMAN When a guy like Nick Halsey (Will Ferrell) gets fired from his job and goes home to tell his wife only to find that she has left him what can you say? And when it transpires that for good measure she has locked him out of the house and frozen his access to their bank account and that his employers who had said that he could keep the company car till the end of the month have decided to reclaim it after all you dont know whether to laugh or cry. It was perhaps that vital indecision--our perennial seesaw between Schadenfreude and pity--that led Dan Rush who wrote and directed ""Everything Must Go"" to cast Ferrell as Nick. If the role had gone to William H. Macy say whose gaze is that of a spaniel that has been told it will never be taken for another walk the heros epic ruefulness would have been readable at a glance. If the role had gone to Steve Carell the shades of despair would have issued as a bravely smiling numbness. So what does Ferrell bring to the party--or at any rate to the movies lowering sense that the party is over? Well we get a dampened slapstick as when Nick is woken by the spray of a garden sprinkler in the face or tries to climb on plastic boxes to scale a wall. Then there are Ferrells pale and piggy eyes which can look mean when there are put-downs to be unleashed (I refer you to last years ""The Other Guys"") but which in this context appear merely drained; any Ferrell fans hoping for rants and raves will be disappointed. As a rule it is not until we see comedians on the defensive that we realize how much of their usual shtick even of the amiable sort has been grounded in offense. That was what Martin Scorsese identified in Jerry Lewis and used for ""The King of Comedy"" in which Lewis seemed taut with discomfort even before he was physically trussed up. In Rushs film Ferrells bulk and height seem similarly stripped of threat. Nick spends much of his time stretched out in a reclining leather chair on his front lawn either drinking or drunk. Before his wife departed and changed the locks she moved his stuff outside a paddle a rotisserie a saxophone a snow globe and so on plus a small stack of books including ""Good to Great"" and ""Speak Up amp; Succeed."" At first he just sits there like a piece of junk himself but gradually the dumping ground becomes a yard sale. All this may look like defiance but its really an act of surrender. Nick could write a book on it ""Shut Up amp; Fail."" ""Everything Must Go"" was inspired by Raymond Carvers ""Why Dont You Dance?"" the first story in ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love."" In my edition it takes up four and a half pages and it tells of a guy sitting out on his lawn with his belongings and talking to a young couple who stop by. There are beautiful Carver parings with words and even punctuation marks elided to leave mysterious gaps in which unspoken or unspeakable feelings may roam Lights came on in houses up and down the street. ""Wouldnt it be funny if"" the girl said and grinned and didnt finish. We never learn the name of the guy or why he is there and this lands Dan Rush with a problem How do you make a movie out of a snapshot? Or add to a concentrated narrative without dilution? When Robert Altman made ""Short Cuts"" (1993) he mixed together nine Carver tales plus a Carver poem to fill the bounds of the film; even so he inserted further episodes of his own devising and Rush too has trusted to invention. Thus we begin in Nicks workplace with the glum rigmarole of his dismissal. We are present when Samantha (Rebecca Hall) pregnant and unaccompanied moves into the house opposite Nicks and when on a sentimental whim Nick pays a visit to Delilah (Laura Dern) a friend from high school purely on the strength of a remark that she scribbled in their yearbook describing him as ""a diamond in the rough."" Both Hall and Dern give expert portraits of benign wariness instantly conscious that the roughness in Nick has scratched the gem beyond repair; look at Delilahs face over his shoulder when by way of farewell he hugs her slightly too long. His main discovery in these alfresco days is Kenny (Christopher Jordan Wallace) a smart black kid on a bicycle at a loose end. He helps Nick find buyers for his worldly goods. ""Focus on the benefits"" Nick advises him. ""Good sale. Youve got the gift"" he adds as Kenny clinches a deal. This is the most endearing and convincing aspect of ""Everything Must Go"" the mild implication that not everything does go--that Nick retains a streak of his business acumen and that the skills and the comforts of the bourgeoisie however inadequate are not to be peeled off like bumper stickers and tossed away. Some of Rushs dialogue is clumsily geared toward the opposite as when Nick tells Samantha to put up some curtains ""so you dont have to look at your future"" or when Kenny asks what happened to him and Nick replies ""Life happened work happened marriage happened."" But the sight of Nick arranging not just strewing his things around him and the look of the film photographed by Michael Barrett tell a more delicate tale. It was shot in Phoenix not in that unforgiving lunchtime glare that Hitchcock used in the Phoenix scenes at the start of ""Psycho"" but in the more tolerant light of early morning and dusk the hours of promise and regret. The result is a sad suburban pastoral a strain of film you dont see much of or not enough; it may feel somewhat stretched and Rushs additions to Carver barely push it past ninety minutes but anything hectic or hasty would have spoiled the mood. The follies of Nick need time and space in which to expand as when he borrows Kennys bike and pedals off to buy beer at the Mini Mart filmed in long shot with high green hills behind him. Ferrell looking as dumb as a clown on a circus bike has found a new metier to take the materials of minor tragedy and wheel them in the direction of farce. Some gods have all the luck. When the hero of ""Thor"" plummets to Earth from a far corner of the cosmos in a storming thunderbolt the first thing he sees upon waking is the face of Natalie Portman. Not a sheep or a branch of Subway or a rainy day in Pittsburgh but I repeat Natalie Portman. He must think that he has died and gone straight back to Heaven. Whats more she plays a research scientist named Jane and in accordance with movie custom is ripe for having her paltry scientific knowledge replaced with the wisdom of myth. ""Do me a favor and dont be dead"" she begs as he lies there and her prayer is answered. Not only is Thor (Chris Hemsworth) not dead; hes really built. Him Thor you Jane. Once Thor stirs the film itself comes belatedly to life. The first twenty minutes or so have been spent in other worlds reachable only by intergalactic wormholes. One is Asgard a haven of golden towers ruled by Thors father the one-eyed Odin (Anthony Hopkins) and closely modelled on the cover of every mid-seventies concept album you wished youd never bought. The other is the domain of red-eyed monsters with weapons of ice who menace Asgards peace and are therefore treated to a violent visit from Thor or as they fearfully call him Defrost. This mission though bold is deemed too reckless by Odin who banishes Thor to Earth--New Mexico to be precise. The countryside is filmed as gracefully as Arizona is in ""Everything Must Go"" and it comes as a genuine relief. ""Thor"" in fact is the years most divided movie to date; everything that happens in the higher realms vaguely derived from Nordic legend is posturing nonsense whereas the scenes down here are managed for the most part with dexterity and wit. ""Thor"" is based on a Marvel comic and directed by Kenneth Branagh. There are two facts you never expected to see in the same sentence. The sequence in which Thor striving to retrieve his precious hammer wrestles with a security guard in the mud has a slight squelching connection with the climactic battle in Branaghs ""Henry V"" but that aside its hard to discern his touch. He seems most at ease with a brassy clash of cultures Thor in a diner dashing his mug of coffee to the floor and crying ""Another"" or striding into a pet store and declaring ""I need a horse."" Special effects seem to muffle rather than quicken Branaghs interest and besides there is no C.G.I. in existence that could cope with the difference between Portman a practicing sylph and Hemsworth who looks to me like six and a half feet of corned beef. At one point he takes his shirt off and she stands beside him a bit dazed with the top of her head not quite parallel with his nipples. At the end--and I am giving away no secrets here--they kiss. But how? Is he holding her up with her little toes kicking his kneecaps? Thor only knows.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Hoberman Will Ferrell Down and Out in Everything Must Go Wednesday May 11 2011 at 4 a.m. By J. Hoberman EXPAND Greatly expanded from a four-page single-situation story by Raymond Carver Dan Rushs first feature Everything Must Go is an ambitious if enervated vehicle for Will Ferrell--playing it straight as Nick Halsey a middle-class drunk fired from his job and locked out of his suburban home by an irate never-seen spouse on the same day. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - As in the Carver story Halsey uses the belongings his wife has dumped outside to set up house on the front lawn. His public humiliation complete with repossessed company car and suspended bank account is barely mitigated by the police detective (Michael Pena) who happens to be his AA sponsor and allows him a five-day grace period in which to operate an impromptu highly metaphoric yard sale--compelled to re-evaluate his past in the light of a cataclysmic present.An ungainly presence who occupies far too much space cultural and otherwise Ferrell is one of the least sympathetic personalities in movies. To his credit he makes almost no attempt here to woo the audience although his self-pitying lug usually seen parked outside in his Barcalounger brewski in paw eventually extracts a modicum of sympathy just by being there. Also by hitting bottom outta money outta beer reduced to panhandling outside the mini-mart.Rush has a background in commercials but the rootsy soundtrack (Lightnin Hopkins Ramblin Jack Odetta the Band) doesnt succeed in selling the movie as an American ballad. Everything Must Go which is ostensibly set in Scottsdale Arizona has a generic resemblance to broken-heartland movies like Up in the Air and Cedar Rapids although this suburban meltdown is more depressed than either. Such warmth as it exists is generated by Halseys two new friends a lonely little boy (14-year-old Christopher Jordan Wallace son of the Notorious B.I.G.) and the pregnant quasi-abandoned young wife across the street (Rebecca Hall) as well as the high school classmate hes inspired to look up (Laura Dern who brightens the movie instantly if briefly).In the final reel Rush introduces a plot complication that had the preceding hour been leaner might have worked--kind of like the Titanic sinking to reveal an iceberg. Still I cant dismiss the desperate social realism of a movie offering the solace of a bromide found in a fortune cookie.1 Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact J.

By David Edelstein Published May 8 2011 ShareThis Will Ferrell and Christopher Jordan Wallace in Everything Must Go.  (Photo John Estes/Courtesy of Roadside Attractions) A teacher of mine named Leo Rockas had a brilliant way of characterizing Chekhov The author he said began by writing conventional narratives with twist endings and then over time lopped off the beginnings and twists leaving only the suggestive essencethe model for the modern short story. Raymond Carvers Why Dont You Dance? is Chekhovian in that way. A middle-aged husband is cast out forced to move his belongings and furniture (including his comfy easy chair) to his lawn where he sits getting blottountil a young couple invades his new world mistaking it for a yard sale. You could give the story to five filmmakers and get five unalike features. Dan Rushs is called Everything Must Go and is perhaps inevitably a dilution. Its also missing Carvers stunning climax the drunken dance between the middle-aged man and the young wife. But the movie is very fine. That lawn with its scraps of a ruined life is a setting both satirical and poignant and Will Ferrell gives a performance of Chekhovian depth. See AlsoEdelstein on the Trippy Tacky Monumental Thor Id say Ferrells work is a revelation except it isnt. Even in slapstick comedies like Step Brothers he shows a delicate touch his child-men holding onto a defensive arrogance that barely conceals their helplessness. As Nick Halsey in Everything Must Go he goes to the far side of that arrogance. Having lost his sales job and home Nick has no more illusions to which to clingonly booze and an easy chair neither of which can hold off reality for long. Yet a glimmer in his eyes suggests he recognizes the splendid absurdity of a yard sale which represents both hopelessness (giving up his old life) and hope (giving up his old life). Rush can be gentle to the point of non-intervention yet he finds a balance between nihilism and faith that should be the envy of more experienced filmmakers. A subplot involving a chubby kid (Christopher Jordan WallaceBiggie Smallss son) whom Nick teaches the art of salesmanship is expertly undersold Rebecca Hall gives Nicks pregnant new neighbor layers of neediness and nervousness and Laura Dern is unspeakably moving as a high-school classmate whom Nick seeks out after rereading a note in his yearbook. The end is wide open neither sentimental nor bitter perhaps less Carverian than Chekhovian but perhaps too the better for it. Everything Must Go Directed by Dan Rush. Roadside Attractions. R.

Everything Must Go still isnt his grab for an Oscar (and Im in no hurry to see him make one) but it is a confident transitional step in that direction should he decide he wants to pull a Sandler or a Carrey. Here he plays Nick Halsey a competent and modestly successful salesman who at the films outset is fired. The cause isnt the poor economy or corporate downsizing -- its Nicks alcoholism. It has caused trouble in the past leading to rehab and even a period of sobriety. But now after an incident on a business trip in Denver it has finally sunk him. Nicks day gets worse when he arrives home to find that his wife has moved out of the house changed the locks canceled his credit cards and put all of his belongings on the lawn. Whatever happened in Denver has proved to be the last straw for her too. Unsurprisingly Nicks response to these setbacks is to acquire as much Pabst Blue Ribbon as he can with his remaining cash and to sit on the lawn and drink. His Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor a cop named Frank Garcia (Michael Pena) stops by to check on him ... and to tell him that city ordinances will only let him keep his stuff on the lawn if hes having a yard sale and only for five days. Nick doesnt actually want to turn the incident into a yard sale but he doesnt have a lot of options. That lack of options is a little strange narratively speaking. Are we to understand that Nick has no one who will come to his aid? No friends no family no sympathetic former colleagues no one but his neglectful AA sponsor? Nick isnt the kind of drunk who alienates everyone -- on the contrary hes a gregarious entertaining fellow. Hes exactly the kind of guy youd love to have a beer with. I dont buy that hes this destitute this suddenly. Be that as it may hes living on his lawn now. Across the street is a pregnant woman named Samantha (Rebecca Hall) who has just moved to the neighborhood in advance of her husband being transferred for his job. She takes some pity on Nick and so does Kenny (Christopher Jordan Wallace) a pudgy outcast teenager from the block. As Nick gradually resigns himself to taking inventory of his belongings he also takes inventory of his life. This material could be the makings of an intense and sober drama about a broken man. It could also be an all-out farce about a hilarious drunken reprobate. Alcoholism goes both ways as you know. Ferrell plays it closer to drama than youd expect him to but hes also given plenty of funny moments. He conveys the seriousness of the characters plight without wallowing in the sadness of it all. Dan Rush the first-time filmmaker who wrote and directed the project (adapting a short story by Raymond Carver) resists the urge to resolve Nicks problems easily or stereotypically. His style isnt showy and Ferrell is likewise restrained. The result is a simple unassuming movie thats grounded in reality and is every bit as likable as Ferrell himself.

TWITTER Will Ferrell does a serious turn in ""Everything Must Go"" with mixed results. He nicely finds humor in his characters otherwise pathetic situation. But the performance is too one-note. Will Ferrell does a serious turn in Everything Must Go with mixed results. Playing an alcoholic at a crucial crossroad in his life he uses his middle-age slacker persona well to convey a guy lost in his own immaturity and low self-esteem. And he nicely finds humor in an otherwise pathetic situation. But the performance is too one-note. Using an acting muscle hitherto ignored Ferrell isnt able to track the ups-and-downs in the storys dramatic beats. Instead he falls back on physical humor and facial expressions that dont quite get to the bottom of what ails his character. The film written and directed by commercials director Dan Rush from a Raymond Carver short story is likewise a mixed blessing. It doesnt try to shake off its literary roots. Rush intends a fable-like quality to his tale about a guy literally forced to live several days on his suburban front lawn. Yet the protagonist is such a sad sack an audience has to do much too much work to like this guy at all. You dont even get the impression that if he stopped drinking he would necessarily be a better person. The key thing in selling Everything Must Go to audiences is to prepare them for a different Will Ferrell. This downbeat tale will sorely disappoint many of his usual fans. Meanwhile the marketing must tip off others about this unusual and often intriguing foray into otherwise familiar territory. The film actually starts out like a somewhat restrained Will Farrell comedy. His Nick Porter sees his world collapse in a single day in an improbable yet comic manner. Fired from his salesman job he returns home to find his wife has left him but not before dumping his possessions on their front lawn and changing the house locks. Then his car gets repossessed. Since he has enough beers in the fridge now on the lawn Nick decides to camp out for a few days. This eventually turns into a yard sale which figuratively means the man is unloading his past. On the lawn are the records owned by his deejay father also a drunk; a projector which allows him to revisit home movies; trophies from playing school sports; and a yearbook that reminds him of an old classmate. He even looks her up. This woman (a fine cameo by Laura Dern) is the first sign of a possible future as well as a reminder that once upon a time he had a good heart. There is also a new neighbor (Rebecca Hall) across the street and a troubled youngster (Christopher Jordan Wallace) from down the block with whom he can discuss his problems -- and eventually theirs. And his AA sponsor a police detective (Michael Pena) drops by with gentle advice. These events dont quite work on a realistic level. Its highly doubtful a wife could cut a husband off from his bank account credit cards and even cell phone. Why would she even want to? But Rush means to strip from his character all the baggage of his life at least for a few days. The rest he can sell. Everything must go. Along the way you do learn more about Nick his drinking work and marriage. And his plight has its impact on those neighbors. But there is something a little pre-ordained about all this a bit well scripted. You see the strategies -- the woman across the street going through similar woes only at an earlier age and a kid with his lack of self-confidence picking up a few pointers from the pro salesman. You could even read into the scenario a critique of suburban America where troubled lives behind placid-looking and essentially false exteriors get dumped onto a neatly manicured lawn for all to see. The film just doesnt mine enough humor or drama from this situation. Meanwhile most of the developments are wholly predictable. The production much of it contained on a single street in Phoenix Arizona is all-around solid especially Michael Barretts cinematography which makes certain you never get bored looking at that same cluttered lawn.

The actor makes it watchable. Without Will Ferrell Dan Rushs low-key feature debut ""Everything Must Go"" would be a tough sit all sad-sack self-loathing and no fun despite the writer-directors inspired choice to lift an idea from Raymond Carvers snapshot-short story ""Why Dont You Dance?"" about a man who attempts to restart his life by moving all his possessions outdoors for a giant yard sale. (In the movie his wife gets the ball rolling.) And while the film is neither entertaining nor profound Ferrell makes it watchable at least. A small distrib could make some decent green packaging the comics rare dramatic turn as ""quirky."" Captivated by the idea of seeing the contents of a mans home turned out onto his front lawn Rush creates an original scenario to explain how he got there Once a successful salesman Nick Porter (Ferrell) finally pushed his wife too far and now shes gone and changed the locks canceled his credit cards and dumped all his earthly possessions on the stoop of their home for the neighbors to see -- a gesture cosmically timed to the day his employers canned him for not being able to keep his drinking in check. (Of course it wouldnt be Raymond Carver without drinking.) With his financial lines cut Nick uses what little money he has left to buy beer and though he never really looks drunk -- not in the slurred rock-bottom ""Days of Wine and Roses"" sense at least -- he is rarely seen more than arms reach from his 12-pack of Pabst Blue Ribbon. Rush isnt interested in petty epiphanies. Nick has been in trouble plenty of times before -- when the cops come by to kick him off his lawn it helps that his sponsor is a police detective (Michael Pena) who buys his friend five days to get his life and possessions sorted if hell just pretend to be hosting a yard sale. For Rush Nick seems to represent a worst-case glimpse of others future. Thats certainly the case for a pregnant young photographer named Samantha (Rebecca Hall) moving in across the street her deadbeat husband conspicuously absent How long till shes dumping all his stuff on her own neatly manicured lawn? The purgative spirit of Carvers four-page story suggested a more interesting psychological dimension than the movie does Why would someone spontaneously liquidate all his possessions? Director Michael Haneke followed this idea to an unsettling extreme in ""The Seventh Continent"" but Rush is far gentler treating the gesture like the sort of wakeup call youd expect from a Cameron Crowe or Nick Hornby (an impression that seems in line with all the Bob Dylan covers on the soundtrack). Rush never shows Nicks wife whom we can judge solely by her possessions -- a deliberate theme of the film since Rush clearly recognizes we are more than the sum of our possessions. Nicks catharsis such as he can find it comes in letting go of all that junk exercise equipment and kitchen appliances useless tchotchkes and unused sporting goods even old high-school yearbooks reflecting an earlier more promising vision of himself. Once a baseball jock Nick may not have been the most likely to succeed but his classmates never would have guessed hed end up here living on his lawn. In the films most poignant scene Nick looks up an old half-forgotten high-school friend (Laura Dern) whod scrawled a flattering note to him so many years ago and the two stand and look at each other realizing theyre not the same people and this isnt the same life. Maybe its time for Nick to molt to let go off all those old dead things. Samantha can help. So can Kenny (Christopher Jordan Wallace who holds his own opposite Ferrell) a black kid whos always hanging around. When Nick isnt humiliating himself out of drunkenness he can be a pretty good guy -- though Rush deserves points for resting the entire film on the shoulders of someone who isnt inherently likable (apart from the fact that hes played by Will Ferrell of course). Ferrell does a fine job navigating what if mounted onstage or executed by a more visionary director could have been powerful stuff (just imagine how tying it to the current foreclosure crisis might have resonated). Peppered with improvised moments and amusing behavioral details its a promising glimpse of both Rushs and Ferrells dramatic potential squandered on a project that while polished lacks the strong original tone of Todd Solondz Terry Zwigoff or the other suburban-subversion pros the director clearly respects.
