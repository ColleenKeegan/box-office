With bills stacking up and his wife (Thandie Newton) gone to NYC college dropout Chris enrols as an intern at a stockbrokers. Life couldnt get much worse. Kicked out of their apartment father and son (played by Smiths kid Jaden) bounce between homeless missions until Chris hopefully secures a job. Given the task of marshalling the saccharine in Steven Conrads script its a credit to Italian director Gabriele Muccino and Smith that they largely eschew the sentimental option. Smith hits all the right notes - understated engaging inspirational - even if his young son threatens to charm him off the screen.

Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" with Will Smith Jaden Christopher Syre Smith Thandie Newton Brian Howe James Karen. Directed by Gabriele Muccino from a screenplay by Steve Conrad. 117 minutes. Rated PG-13 for some language. Several theaters. Will Smith is perpetually underrated as an actor because he rarely challenges himself For every ""Ali"" he seems to make five or 10 movies like ""Bad Boys II"" or ""Wild Wild West"" which trade on his relaxed affability but dont require much more than a rakish grin. ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" (and yes Ill get to the spelling in a minute) therefore comes as a pleasant reminder that Smith when called upon can deliver some rather more complicated goods. As Chris Gardner a struggling single father in 80s San Francisco Smith looks haggard and weary; you occasionally hear a bit of a tremble in his voice. Hes on the verge of breaking down but is determined to hold it together for the sake of his son. The real-life Chris Gardner on whose story the film is based overcame poverty and homelessness to become a successful stockbroker. (His memoir also called ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" was recently published. Some significant changes have been made between Gardners real story and the movie version.) In the film which begins with Chris wife Linda (Thandie Newton) on the verge of leaving him and their 5-year-old son Christopher (Jaden Christopher Syre Smith Will Smiths real-life son) we watch Chris -- then a not-too-successful salesman of medical instruments -- talk his way into a stockbroker internship at Dean Witter only to find that it is unpaid. Determined to climb the ladder and make a better life for Christopher he accepts the internship and we watch the father/son duo move from apartment to motel room to homeless shelter with a few nights in a mens room in a BART station along the way. Throughout Chris is haunted by a mural outside his sons day-care center which includes the Declaration of Independences phrase about mans inalienable right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Its misspelled on the mural as ""happyness"" which annoys him -- he wants his son to learn things correctly -- but also seems to serve as a challenge. Smith creates a palpable warmth with his son; his Chris is motivated by a fierce desire to keep the world safe for his precious child. Jaden Smith (now 8 years old and a charmer) is a natural onscreen even throwing a convincing tantrum at one point This little boy is a nice kid but no angel. Their performances are the reason to watch the movie. We know exactly where ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" is going and some of the plot devices created for the movie by screenwriter Steve Conrad (such as Chris constantly managing to lose -- and find -- the instruments he sells and being a Rubiks Cube whiz) feel a bit cute. But director Gabriele Muccino finds the heart of the film in the bond between Chris and Christopher and in Chris realistically depicted downhill trajectory; poverty here is as close as a missed sale. Ultimately the real Chris Gardner emerges as an inspirational American success story -- and Will Smith emerges as a fine and nuanced actor.

Photo Credit Zade Rosenthal Photo Zade Rosenthal MOVIE REVIEWS / Down and out in San Francisco but on a path paved with gold 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Pursuit of Happyness Starring Will Smith Thandie Newton and Jaden Christopher Syre Smith. Directed by Gabriele Muccino. (PG-13. 117 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) No one would make a movie about a guy struggling to succeed who doesnt ultimately succeed. Certainly no one would make a Will Smith movie about a guy who breaks under the strain of his difficult life abandons his child and dies. Thats just not going to happen. And because we know that -- because weve seen more than one movie in our lives -- ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" has a particular challenge To take the real-life rags-to-riches story of stockbroker Chris Gardner a story with a preordained happy ending and imbue it with tension and suspense. [Podcast Mick LaSalle on Happyness Dreamgirls.] The great surprise of the picture is that its not corny. It may have seemed that way from the trailer Will Smith tells his son ""Dont ever let anyone tell you that you cant do something -- even me."" But in context even that moment isnt cloying. The beauty of the film is its honesty. In its outlines its nothing like the usual success story depicted onscreen in which after a reasonable interval of disappointment success arrives wrapped in a ribbon and a bow. Instead this success story follows the pattern most common in life -- it chronicles a series of soul-sickening failures and defeats missed opportunities sure things that didnt quite happen all of which are accompanied by a concomitant accretion of barely perceptible victories that gradually amount to something. In other words it all feels real. Gabriele Muccino (""LUltimo Bacio"") directed it and his fine Italian hand can be detected in Andrea Guerras score with its Italianate wistfulness and whimsicality and in Muccinos very European enjoyment of American poverty and desperation. He finds both on the streets of San Francisco -- circa 1981 in this case but some things dont change -- and he films them in a way that were always aware Our hero works hard. Hes doing everything he can and he has a son he is raising on his own. Yet even without a false move on his part just an extra push of bad luck he might land on those streets and with such a thud he might never rise. As in all rags-to-riches tales we find the protagonist Chris unappreciated and looked down upon at the start. He is struggling to make a go of it by selling bone-density scanners and spends his days lugging around a thing that looks like a movie projector case and hearing doctors tell him theyre not interested. His wife disdains him. Actually the treatment of the wife is the first hint that ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" is going to be an usually uncompromising movie. The wife (Thandie Newton) is a poisonous harpie with no redeeming traits. The filmmakers are not messing around Chris has it bad. In fact he is an extraordinary man but no one is paying attention to him long enough to notice. He decides he wants to get an internship as a stockbroker for Dean Witter and realizing that his resume looks weak he sets out to meet the man in charge and say a few words on his own behalf. Throughout the film had Chris had just a little more pride and a little less intelligence he would blow it. But he remains friendly and resilient never indulging in anger never letting anyone elses mistaken perception of him wound him at his core. He stays fixed on his objective and warm in his response to the world -- and even then things dont improve right away. Having proceeded to establish Chris as a great guy ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" puts him through hell. The wife leaving is just the beginning (actually that seems a little like good luck). Chris has to raise a son (played by Will Smiths own real-life son Jaden Christopher Syre Smith) and do an unpaid internship while selling those bone-density scanners on the side. If it werent for the soup kitchens at Glide Memorial he and his son often wouldnt eat. Will Smith has the right quality for the role -- hes an easy man to root for -- but he augments this by channeling some inner quality of desperation and need. Frankly I dont know where he found it; Smith was touched by luck at a very young age. Yet he does find it. In the taxicab scene in which he tries to impress a prospective employer by solving the Rubiks Cube and in every other scene in which Chris has to sit or stand there smiling while another man pronounces on his fate Smith is right there with the right emotions absolute hope and total terror. -- Advisory This movie contains strong language.

Photo Columbia Pictures The Pursuit of Happyness 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Will Smith bless him is a star. Hes a star in the way that Jimmy Stewart was a star -- as a relaxed familiar figure whose presence in a film signals its hospitality to movie goers. Just smart enough just handsome enough just funny enough Smith is the sort of celebrity who succeeds by being exactly like the rest of us only one notch better. Hes the opposite of Dr. Phil He makes us feel not-bad about ourselves. If actors were outmoded self-help books hed be Im OK Youre OK. If actors were furniture hed be a huge overstuffed leather sofa. One thing Smith has never been is a high-octane serious actor man because hes never worn his roles with any arty stiffness in his joints. Hes just you know a guy. But in The Pursuit of Happyness Smith brings the art of guyness to an apex of compassion and understanding; he blends into the part of a downtrodden single dad with such easy-bones naturalism that its hard for once to remember that hes Will Smith movie star. The Pursuit of Happyness is based on Chris Gardners memoir of scraping by in San Francisco while raising a son and pursuing a nonpaying stockbroker-trainee job for Dean Witter. Gardners son is played by Smiths own 8-year-old Jaden Christopher Syre Smith a bit of casting that might easily have backfired. Yet it works. The whole thing works. This earnest modest sweet little ode to paternal love is meant to warm the cockles of our hearts in a season overrun with cockle-warming and even a recalcitrant Scrooge may sniff back a few salty droplets. Directed by Italian filmmaker Gabriele Muccino (Remember Me My Love) The Pursuit of Happyness opens in 1981 on Gardners life as a husband father and seller of bone-density scanners that few doctors need and fewer can afford. We see from the get-go Chris devotion to his son and his shoe-leather perseverance with the scanners; we also see his nit-picking nasty wife (Thandie Newton) who hangs around just long enough to abandon him for a better life back East. Chris copes as best he can trying to make the rent failing to make the rent moving into a motel trying and failing to make the rent there. A glimpse of hotshot stockbrokers driving hotshot wheels sparks dreams of capitalist glory that Chris pursues despite every conceivable setback. He wows the suits at Dean Witter with his forthrightness and flair for Rubiks Cube. And he rears his son with a nurturing steadfast love that sustains them both when theyve hit bottom on a bed of toilet paper. A few words about the word ""Happyness"" The unconventional spelling is explained succinctly in the movies first minutes as the protagonist brings his boy to a Chinatown day care. A sign in the window promises ""JOY FUN HAPPYNESS"" an error that irks the meticulous Chris. But as he embarks on his own Jeffersonian quest -- as he asks whether happiness ""is something that we can only pursue"" -- the word becomes a synonym for every worldly comfort hes been denied. Is he happy at the end? I know I was despite Muccinos uninventive direction and a plot trajectory that lands squarely where anticipated Its a small but dear thing this heartfelt parental memoir.

By  Lisa Kennedy PUBLISHED December 13 2006 at 421 pm | UPDATED May 8 2016 at 114 am Sign up for newsletters and alerts Submit your news tips or photos Most Popular Donald Trump stumps in Colorado promises ""No more Mr. Nice Guy"" Chris Harris INT injuries and 8 other observations from Day 2 of Broncos training camp Broncos offensive line can live with the blame game. Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post See Chris Gardner run. See Gardner run through the streets of San Francisco. See him run - often with young son Chris in harried tow. Make no mistake in ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" the chase is a great deal of the point. And this heart-provoking drama argues that the emphasis on one of our inalienable rights falls squarely on the striving more than the happiness. Will Smith gets quite the workout as Gardner a dedicated father whose plunge into homelessness occurs at the same time he wins a spot in a competitive internship at the brokerage firm Dean Witter. He is not alone in navigating rough waters. His wife bolts leaving their 5-year-old in his care. Smiths acting receives a welcome stretch in director Gabriele Muccinos take on Gardners real-life struggles. The stockbrokers story was told in a 2002 edition of TVs ""20/20."" As the the movie begins Gardner and wife Linda are already straining against circumstance and each other. He lugs more than he sells ""bone density scanners."" The unwieldly machines look more like beat-up projectors from a high school AV closet than some high-tech wonder. In one of the few moments of hope between the couple a flashback catches them standing in front of their apartment building as the devices are delivered. Thandie Newton works herself raw against a script (by ""The Weather Man"" scribe Steven Conrad) that renders her a shrew. Yet its hard to summon much sympathy for her. Lindas bitter exhaustion is tiring. When she announces shes leaving we feel a guilty relief. ""Pursuit of Happyness"" isnt just a balm intended to heal negative depictions of AWOL African-American fathers. The movie pays respect to all single parents striving to do the right thing with few resources. An amiable actor Smith digs deepest when he depicts a real-life person. Gardners drive desperation and devotion to his son give the actor a wealth of material to explore. Smiths performance - here and in ""Ali"" and ""Six Degrees of Separation"" - suggests he loves the honor and burden of standing in another mans shoes. (Or in the case of Gardner another mans socks. When a mad dash against traffic sends him airborne Gardner doesnt wait for the cops or EMTs. He just wants to find the shoe he lost when hit by a car and head to the office.) ""Pursuit"" constantly tries to bring some levity to the story. But the results are mixed - even the gags leave a bittersweet taste. A running joke has Gardner losing his scanners and then seeing them in the custody of folks with even fewer means than he has. Making an endearing debut as young Chris is Smith and actor Jada Pinkett Smiths wild- haired son. (Gardners actual son was a toddler.) Jaden Christopher Syre Smith is believable funny even as a youngster with a deep trust of his father but also confused by the life they begin to live. His role adds another layer of humanity to ""Pursuit."" Its a lovely natural performance that hints at things to come. An unresolved tension tugs at the generous heart of this movie one between opportunity and disparity. As outsiders so often do Muccino an Italian making his first English-language film gets this. In the opening minutes of the film he shows a river of multi-ethnic San Franciscans walking in that citys astringent light. Beneath that undulating crowd an unkempt man lies facedown on the sidewalk. Chronic homelessness is tricky to depict in a movie that holds hope as one of its truest ideals. While Smith makes it easy to cheer Gardners gumption to take comfort in our sense hell triumph many of the environs he travels in are not happy places. Indeed Gardners rise at Dean Witter isnt nearly as gripping as his journey through our dark places though each requires the other. One of the gifts of ""Pursuit of Happyness"" is that it visits places many of us seldom journey shelters church services public spaces made private in despair. Headed toward an uplifting ending ""Pursuit"" tells enough relentless truths to make us grateful but also mindful this holiday season.

"Will Smith gives a stinging performance as a single father running hard for Happyness - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Lost in the dream In finely wrought Pursuit success is always one step away By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  December 15 2006 ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" is a curious bird to have landed in this awards-conscious season. For one thing Will Smiths performance as a striving single dad has the grace to not panhandle for an Oscar. For another theres very little self-congratulation about the film and much thats uncomfortably dark. A quietly agonized drama of reaching and missing and reaching again it takes place in the crack between the American dream and its nightmare shadow. Its a fine film with a portrait of fatherhood that feels scuffed and driven and real.The movie is set in San Francisco at the height of the Reagan 80s for no other reason than that its based on a true story. Smith plays Chris Gardner the kind of man who once was a whip - smart kid but has never realized his potential. Having sunk his savings into a line of medical scanners that arent selling Chris is beginning to fray at the seams. His wife Linda (Thandie Newton looking worn to the bone) cant handle the stress especially when her husband impulsively decides hed rather be a stockbroker instead.Soon enough Chris has solo care of his 5-year-old son Christopher (played by Smiths own son Jaden). Using his natural bravado and a knack with a Rubiks Cube the 30-something high school graduate talks himself into a six-month internship at Dean Witter with a long-shot chance for a job at the end. The catch is that theres no pay.""The Pursuit of Happyness"" -- the title comes from a misspelled schoolhouse mural -- has a lot on its mind but mostly this If America is about the promise of bettering oneself why does it have to be so freaking hard?Chris has one foot on an escalator going up and one foot on an elevator plummeting into the socioeconomic basement. While the other interns work late he has to get his son out of day care. Casual misfortunes pile up; homelessness nears like an out-of-control car spinning toward the hero in slow-motion. Which Chris will become the real one? The can-do salesman in a suit or the father desperately protecting his son in the wee hours of a city shelter?The film has been lightly fictionalized from the life of the actual Chris Gardner who has since written his own inspirational autobiography of the same name. The movies not as interested in uplift though as it is in panic and the resourcefulness it engenders.Chris is a charmer and he never stops running -- to do so would be to admit defeat to his son -- but Smith nevertheless conveys the gradual erosion of a mans self-worth. I dont think Ive seen a mainstream movie get fatherhood so right since ""Kramer vs . Kramer"" the fear the indulgence the snappishness the pre-occupied ""uh-huhs"" as a child natters about his day the steamrolling waves of love. Maybe Smiths got it easy because hes playing opposite his son (Jaden certainly looks comfortable hanging with his dad) but the understated beauty of the performance lies in how little attention Chris actually gives the kid. Hes too busy worrying about Christopher to be with him.The director is Gabriele Muccino the writer-director of the 2001 Italian art - house hit ""The Last Kiss"" from which this years substandard Zach Braff movie was extracted. Theres a European sensibility to the storytelling Behavior here is observed rather than underlined and where an American director might overplay the racial divide between Chris and his WASPy bosses at Dean Witter Muccino and screenwriter Steven Conrad (""The Weather Man"") let it go. The top man at the firm played by that dear old character actor James Karen  is happy to grant Chris his humanity. Hejust cant see that the mans drowning.""The Pursuit of Happyness"" is also a San Francisco movie to its bones with a very specific sense of place and vibe. (The WASPs probably wouldnt be quite as inviting in an East Coast film.) But everything about it is specific from the gray peppering Smiths hair to the hush of a wealthy suburb on a weekend afternoon in one scene.There are a few too many coincidences involving errant medical scanners and that Rubiks Cube is both a screenwriters invention and a cross-promoters dream. By and large though the film stays clear of Hollywood mucking about. Again its a curious movie for the season -- a reminder of how close we dance to the pit how easy it is to fall in how heartbreakingly difficult it can be to clamber out. This alone makes it a welcome holiday meal. Smiths portrait of resilience and Muccinos clarity of heart are simply the gravy.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Hudson Soars As Spurned Motown Singer In Sumptuous Dreamgirls Murphys Terrific Foxx Is Distant; Sentiment Stalks Pursuit; Cute Dragon Fires Up Eragon By Joe Morgenstern Updated Dec. 15 2006 1201 a.m. ET The human voice in full cry borders on the miraculous -- an infants throat can project tones of piercing urgency at phenomenal intensity. Then theres the phenomenon of Jennifer Hudson Her soaring sinuous voice raises up the film version of ""Dreamgirls"" and finally transcends it. She plays Effie the role originated on Broadway a quarter-century ago by Jennifer Holliday. Its one of those show-stopping performances that makes your heart race and your ears stand on end -- full of unrequited love and ferocious passion. Shes the best part of the show by far but the writer-director Bill Condon who wrote the screenplay for ""Chicago"" four years ago has done the original ""Dreamgirls"" proud without solving its dramatic problems. Whats up there on screen looks grand and sounds grander a sumptuous vehicle that glides from one number to the next -- with periodic slowdowns for melodrama -- like the two-toned Caddy in one of its songs. For those who may have managed not to notice over the course of that past quarter-century ""Dreamgirls"" is a rousing musical a clef that follows through the 60s and 70s the emergence and turbulent evolution of the Dreamettes a trio inspired by Diana Ross and the Supremes. Beyonce Knowles plays the Ross character Deena with a blandness that could almost be seen as satirical. Anika Noni Roses Lorrell is not only talented and attractive but much more interesting than the sweet giggler she first seems to be. ENLARGE Eddie Murphy throws himself with gleeful abandon into the role of James ""Thunder"" Early a character meant to evoke singers like James Brown Jackie Wilson or Marvin Gaye. His singing numbers are terrific though that should come as no surprise considering what Mr. Murphy can do when hes on his game; his disembodied speaking voice was the animating spirit of ""Shrek."" The big -- bad -- surprise is Jamie Foxx who as the conniving Berry Gordy-esque manager Curtis looks constantly disconsolate as if he wished he were anywhere but in front of Tobias Schliesslers camera. (Thats no knock on the cinematographer; his work like that of the production designer John Myhre is superb.) Didnt anyone tell Mr. Foxx that playing villains can be fun? ""Dreamgirls"" covers a lot of ground. Its a history lesson about the journey from Ramp;B to disco a cautionary tale about the appropriation of black music by white artists a bittersweet fable about conventional beauty trumping rare talent Deena sings well goodness knows but Effie has the unquenchable fire. Because the Dreamettes manager is so unpleasant even before he betrays Effie by making Deena the lead singer its hard to see why Effie keeps loving the miserable creep for so long. Logic takes a hike though once the wronged songbird launches into the shows signature anthem ""And I Am Telling You Im Not Going."" When Jennifer Hudson sings alls right with the world. The Pursuit of Happyness ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" goes beyond tugging at our heartstrings. It plucks them strokes them strums them plays them for all theyre worth. Thats both the strength and the weakness of this inspirational drama directed by Gabriele Muccino which takes the misspelling in its title from a mural on a San Francisco wall. Will Smith stars as Chris Gardner a suddenly single salesman trying to keep himself and his young son afloat in the early 1980s while he chases the American dream via an unpaid internship -- at Dean Witter Reynolds -- that may or may not lead to a paid position as a stockbroker. Chriss plight based in part on a true story becomes a desperate one and Mr. Smith a marvelous actor with richly earned reserves of good will keeps us caring sometimes urgently about the fate of this devoted father and his beautiful son (who is played beautifully by Will Smiths real-life son Jaden.) Yet the pursuit is manipulative and repetitive -- how many times can Chris who sells bone-density scanners chase after someone whos stolen one of his machines? And the hero outruns any questions about material wealth as a panacea. For a while those questions seem significant but then the films sense of irony disappears. The deeper Chris falls into poverty the more convinced he seems to be that money will buy happyness as advertised. That poverty is deep almost Dickensian The script was written by Steve Conrad who wrote a singularly bleak movie called ""The Weather Man."" Be prepared then to feel good and feel bad though not necessarily in that order. Eragon Im going to cut a worthy dragon some slack. ""Eragon"" the screen version of Christopher Paolinis novel isnt likely to be mistaken for a Lucas-less episode of ""Star Wars"" even though the teenage dragon rider of the title (played by newcomer Ed Speleers) saves his kingdom in the fashion of Luke Skywalker and Eragons mentor Brom played with fragrant mournfulness by Jeremy Irons has filched the wisdom of the ages from Obi-Wans play book. But the star of this fantasy adventure for young audiences is a charmer from the moment she is hatched (from a huge blue egg that starts to rock like a Mexican jumping bean). Her name is Saphira she speaks with the voice of Rachel Weisz and it doesnt matter that shes too young to breathe fire -- at first -- or that she waddles a bit on the ground because she lives and breathes the joy of flight which is exactly what was missing from most of Harry Potters solos on a broom. (Saphira also lands hot and hard like a fully loaded Boeing 727.) The film is the directorial debut of Stefen Fangmeier a special-effects wizard of renown and looks it -- i.e. magically and sumptuously detailed. The production designer was Wolf Kroeger who has a special place in my heart for having designed Robert Altmans ""Popeye"" and the cinematographer was Hugh Johnson. John Malkovichs vile monarch Galbatorix and Robert Carlyles etiolated sorcerer Durza provide the element of evil in abundance. Home of the Brave If theres a way to do justice to the story of American troops coming home from Iraq ""Home of the Brave"" hasnt found it. Irwin Winklers update of William Wylers ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" starts well with the stirring spectacle of young men and women members of a National Guard unit stationed south of Baghdad struggling to do their duty in an alien land of unfathomable danger. Once they return however wounded physically or shattered spiritually the film turns didactic contrived and occasionally ludicrous. Exactly what for example are we to make of Jessica Biel as an amputee when the camera dwells as it often does on the stump of her digitally altered arm? That she sacrificed a hand for the sake of her role? Im slightly sorry to be snide but filling that role with a Hollywood beauty however talented she may be dishonors the memory of Harold Russell the real-life double amputee of Wylers peerless film. Its a fatuous choice that borders on farce. The Good German To paraphrase the words of Winston Churchill who is seen in newsreel footage of the Potsdam Peace Conference in ""The Good German"" Steven Soderberghs new film is a puzzle wrapped in a mystery inside a perversity. The puzzle is Mr. Soderberghs approach to what might have been an intriguing experiment rather than the off-putting one it turned out to be. His idea was to use the devastation of postwar Berlin as the setting for a period piece involving murder political intrigue moral ambiguity and romance -- a film noir in the tradition of ""Casablanca"" or ""The Third Man"" -- and then to shoot it with contemporary actors in the visual and dramatic style of the period. Paul Attanasios script was adapted from an estimable novel by Joseph Kanon. The stars are first-rate George Clooney Tobey Maguire and Cate Blanchett. And the technique is fascinating black-and-white cinematography (on color stock with the color bleached out) soft images via lenses that now qualify as antiques performances that echo the old film-noir acting style. Mysteriously however and to a degree that truly suggests perversity Mr. Soderbergh seems to have done everything within his power to keep the audience at arms length. The echoes in the dialogue arent evocative theyre dissonant and tinny (except for Cate Blanchetts marvelously husky channeling of Marlene Dietrich). Every character is dislikable at the start; by the time some humanity intrudes its too late. Theres hardly any feeling let alone romance; even the ex-lovers back story of Berlin before the war has a tawdry tinge. The sole exception is Thomas Newmans complex sweepingly romantic and thoroughly magnificent score. Its everything the film might have been.    DVD TIP The Supremes got an earlier reworking in ""Sparkle"" (1976) the story of three singing sisters from Harlem. The film is uneven at best but Lonette McKee is sensational as Sister the wild-spirited lead singer. The songs are by Curtis Mayfield. Sam OSteen directed from Joel Schumachers schematic script.

"Pursuit of Happyness An Uphill Climb Thats an Exhilarating Breath of Fresh Air washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Pursuit of Happyness An Uphill Climb Thats an Exhilarating Breath of Fresh Air Will Smith and his son Jaden play down-on-his-luck salesman Christopher Gardner and his son who learn that if life hands you lemons open a lemonade stand. (By Zade Rosenthal -- Columbia Pictures) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 15 2006 You can look up ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" on the Internet Movie Database and see that a guy named Gabriele Muccino made it. Or you can pay attention during the credits and learn the same thing. Except its wrong. He didnt make it. You know who made it? Your old man made it. Its certainly got the old mans lessons the ones you thought were so full of hooey. Remember when he told you ""Stick to it until its done""? What did he know? And then there was ""Get along with your boss. Hes your boss because hes earned it."" What a crock. And then ""Dont whine dont make excuses just do the job."" Boy that one was a bummer. What was he a Republican or something? And finally worst of all the one nobody wants to hear it hurts so much ""Work like hell."" I hate that one. But those are the lessons and that is the sermon of ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" a radically conservative encomium to trying hard to capitalism to salesmanship to Dean Witter to never saying die and to reaping the big reward. The film is the biography of a real guy named Christopher Gardner whom Will Smith charming and bright embodies to the fingertips. As the film has it Chris is (a) extremely likable (b) a whiz with numbers and (c) a total loser. And why is Chris a loser? Well wanting his piece of the dream and trusting in his salesmanship he has invested in a bone scanner about the size of a sewing machine and tramps about the San Francisco area (its the early 1980s) trying to sell them to physicians. He has the salesmans gift of gab; he has a legitimate even excellent product; he is relentless. The problem is as he learns all too quickly the machines are Cadillacs in a VW market; they do the job too well and most practices dont really need them. So the lack of success is grinding him down down down; hes not moving a single unit. The rent is due. Hes behind in all his other payments. His wife is working double shifts in a hotel laundry. He has bad issues of self-doubt and when he looks at his little boy and thinks how close the wolf is to the door it scares him into despair.

"Pursuit of Happyness The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; pursuit-of-happyness-the ) Pursuit of Happyness The (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli With a title like The Pursuit of Happyness you expect the characters to get to the promised land. They do but if the journey matters more than the destination this is a movie to skip. The Pursuit of Happyness is long dull and depressing. It expands into two hours a story that could have been told more effectively in one. This is not the feel-good movie of the season unless you believe that a few moments of good cheer can redeem 110 minutes of gloom. Sitting through The Pursuit of Happyness is a chore. Downbeat movies arent inherently bad (in fact many are powerful) but this one provides artificial characters in contrived circumstances. How is it that movies ""inspired by a real story"" often feel more fake than those fully embedded in the realm of fiction? Will Smith has generated Oscar buzz for his portrayal of Chris Gardner the real-life guy whose rags-to-riches story forms the basis of the movie. (Impoverished guy becomes capitalist poster boy.) While its fair to say that this is one of the best straight performances of Smiths career it didnt blow me away. In and of itself the acting while effective is not Best Actor material but it wouldnt surprise me if the movies prestige factor and Smiths popularity earn him a nod. Meanwhile his female co-star Thandie Newton isnt going to be considered for any award. Newton spends about 90% of her screen time doing an impersonation of a harpy screeching bitching and contorting her face into unpleasant expressions. Smiths son Jaden is okay as the movies child protagonist; its unclear whether his occasional deficiencies are the result of his acting Steven Conrads writing or Gabriele Muccinos direction but theres not much personality behind the cute features and curly hair. Chris Gardner (Will Smith) is down on his luck. Its 1981 San Francisco and his self-employed business of selling portable bone density scanners isnt doing well. His wife Linda (Thandie Newton) does nothing but yell at him and give him a cold shoulder and the lack of domestic harmony is impacting the disposition of his beloved son Christopher (Jaden Christopher Syre Smith). Thats when Chris life turns into a country song. His wife leaves. He is evicted from his home. He goes to jail neither passing GO nor collecting a much-needed 200. He gets hit by a car. He is robbed. He makes his son cry. He alienates a friend over 14. He gets to spend a night in the cleanest public restroom in the history of public restrooms. But theres a bright spot although you need a dark-adapted eye to find it. Despite having no experience Chris applies to enter an internship program at Dean Witter. He would appear to have no chance to get in until he amazes the head of the program (Brian Howe) by solving the Rubiks Cube puzzle in the back of a taxi cab. Its a blessing that the movie doesnt use a stock villain to impede Chris herky-jerky trip to the top because that would have tipped the movie into the empire of the unwatchable. However the lack of a strong conflict makes the two-hour running length seem very long. Thankfully theres also not much in the way of overt melodrama but that could be a byproduct of having characters who are not deeply realized and have narrow emotional ranges. Its tough to connect with Chris and his son. Although they are played by a real-life father and son theres no chemistry between them. Were constantly told how desperately Chris loves Christopher but it takes a long time before we begin to buy it. Most of the time Christopher seems like an annoying piece of baggage that Chris drops off at daycare when he has other things to do. The films most compelling scenes are those that show Chris struggling to enter the rat race. Granted this is no Glengarry Glen Ross but it shows the pressure these salesmen are under and how important the contact lists are. In the overall scheme of things however these sequences are background noise. They are neither plentiful nor lengthy. The movie spends more time following Chris on his futile sales rounds for the bone density scanner than it does accompanying him during his broker training. The moral of the story is as trite as they come dont let anyone convince you to give up on your dreams. Disney animated films have been doing this better for decades. The Pursuit of Happyness concludes with a caption that tells us what happens to Chris after the end of the movie; it promises a better story than the one we have just watched. The film is also marred by a persistent (although not verbose) voiceover that adds nothing to the story while frequently jerking us out of the experience of watching it. I dont need Will Smith telling me ""This part of the story is called riding the bus."" This is the English-language debut of Gabriele Muccino who has made a name for himself in Italian cinema. The Pursuit of Happyness has the kind of slow drab tone one occasionally associates with a director raised outside of the Hollywood system. What can be an asset in some circumstances is a detriment in this one. The Pursuit of Happyness isnt enjoyable and its meager pleasures including the eventual ""payoff"" arent enough to justify the unrelenting misery. The Pursuit of Happyness is competently made and gets lots of the details right but when it comes to the emotional core of the story it loses the pursuit and misses the ""happyness.""

The movie is an economic cliff-hanger. It tells the (largely true) story of Chris Gardner (Smith) who in 1980 is barely getting by as a salesman for high-end bone-density scanners that he lugs from hospital to hospital in and around San Francisco. Folded up the scanner looks like an old portable turntable--or according to a passing acid casualty a time machine. Chris knows these scanners are too expensive but he paid for them out of pocket and isnt selling them quickly enough. His wife Linda (Thandie Newton) dissolves under the strain and decamps--at which point Chris who has no college degree decides against ridiculous odds to try to talk his way into a six-month nonpaying internship with Dean Witter Reynolds. The director Gabriele Muccino and the screenwriter Steven Conrad dont underline the central irony--the hysterically narrow margin in the film between prosperity and homelessness. But that irony is in every jittery frame the American Dream astride the American tragedy. Americanisms abound in The Pursuit of Happyness starting with the title which appears on a collage outside Chriss five-year-olds day-care center. The misspelling prompts Chriss ruminations (in voice-over) on the meaning of happiness (a fertile subject) and more important on pursuit. Hes always making mad dashes--after doctors stockbrokers investors. The filmmakers dont seem to worry about whether Chris believes in what hes selling--theyre neutral on the subject of whether that scanner is a smart buy or Dean Witter really know whats best for peoples money. ""Pursuit"" in this context is a Jeffersonian way of saying ""hustle."" At one point my notes on The Pursuit of Happyness read (I swear) ""Grim. Grim. Wow thats grim. Going down. Down down down. Weve hit bottom now. Oh God were still sinking. It cant get any worse. Oh no "" Conrads last film the underrated The Weather Man was a parade of miseries too but the protagonist (Nicolas Cage) didnt move very fast in the throes of his existential crisis and the palette (it was Chicago in winter) was glacial. Here those crazy San Francisco hills give the movie a lift and Muccino frames it all airily with a glancing touch. The only tinny note is the departure of the wife who seems less concerned about the welfare of her child than I (and I hope you) would be. Will Smith is superb. He often plays hustlers but never a hustler with a wolf at the door hustling for his life. Or more accurate for his sons life. The boy is in fact Will and Jada Pinkett Smiths son and has a lovely watchful presence. Did that presence give Smiths acting extra urgency? --Reviewed by David Edelstein New York Magazine Share this story...

The fact-inspired drama ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" is more inspirational than creatively inspired -- imbued with the kind of uplifting afterschool-special qualities that can trigger a major toothache. Clearly savoring the chance to work alongside his moppet son Will Smith is in serious mode as Chris Gardner whose story is one of perseverance overcoming tremendous hardship. Smiths heartfelt performance is easy to admire. But the movies painfully earnest tone should skew its appeal to the portion of the audience that admittedly has catapulted many cloying TV movies into hits and an endorsement from Oprah Winfrey on her popular talkshow cant hurt. Strictly in political terms the film could hardly be more finely tuned -- offering a sympathetic view of those struggling to stay out of poverty as well as a ""pull yourself up by the bootstraps"" message. And in that calculation resides its basic flaw -- a nagging sense throughout that were being emotionally played. Deriving its title from a misspelling at the San Francisco daycare center where Gardner parks his son the narrative unfolds in 1981 as the protagonists voiceover narration identifies various chapters in his life. At its core theres a grand sense of the American dream in Gardners rags-to-riches experience -- a guy who found himself homeless and sleeping in subway stations only to become a multimillionaire. ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" devotes its two hours entirely to that struggle wrenching as it often is. Gardner states at the outset that he didnt know his own father and was determined not to let that happen with his own children. Unfortunately he squanders his savings investing in a medical gizmo driving a wedge between him and his wife (Thandie Newton) who eventually takes flight. At that point the film becomes a bit of ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" meets ""Homeless to Harvard"" as single dad Chris endeavors to keep himself and his 5-year-old son Christopher (Jaden Christopher Syre Smith) afloat financially while pursuing a tantalizing but maddening opportunity an unpaid internship at brokerage firm Dean Witter Reynolds that offers no promise of employment at the six-month trials conclusion. Along the way Chris rides an economic roller-coaster at various points having to sleep in a shelter or worse a BART station restroom -- cleverly turning the latter ordeal into a game to help his not-fully-understanding boy endure the night. Still because anyone who has done the slightest research knows this tale is ultimately one of capitalistic triumph (there wouldnt be a movie otherwise) the building toward that inevitable climax proves a sometimes arduous slog. The younger Smith is allowed to deliver a natural childlike performance though occasionally Gabriele Muccino the Italian helmer of ""The Last Kiss"" making his English-language debut and writer Steven Conrad unhelpfully saddle the tot with big chewy mouthfuls of dialogue. For the most part though the movie is the elder Smiths showcase and he throws his all into the role. Yet while there are occasional flashes of personality -- such as the moment when Gardner wows a potential employer (Brian Howe) by mastering a Rubiks cube -- the circumstances restrain him as the movie operates in a rather narrow emotional range before its eventual payoff. (Gardner credited as an associate producer came to the producers attention via a ""20/20"" profile and only a brief footnote addresses his subsequent accomplishments.) Technically pic does a nice job of re-creating the Bay Area a quarter-century ago through music and wardrobe and Andrea Guerras score establishes a properly melancholy tone. In the final accounting however ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" winds up being a little like the determined salesman Mr. Gardner himself easy to root for certainly but not that much fun to spend time with.

Whatever the role (love coach alien fighter Ali) he projects speed and good times an almost aerobic self-confidence. But in The Pursuit of Happyness which is set in San Francisco in 1981 at the dawn of the age of go-go capitalism Smith doesnt just wear a few flecks of gray in his hair. He slows himself down playing a man who awakens to the reality that life is nickel-and-diming him to death. Its a beautiful and understated performance one that hums with a richer quieter music than Smith has mustered before. What hooks you in this shrewdly touching movie based on a true story is how specific it is about one mans economic perils. Smiths Chris Gardner is an earnest fellow in his late 30s who sells medical equipment -- or rather one particular item a high-density bone scanner that he hawks with middling success on a freelance basis. His mistake was to invest his savings in these contraptions and now hes stuck toting them around town like oversize typewriters. His marriage has fallen apart and when the prickly impatient Linda (Thandie Newton) takes off leaving Chris and his young son (played by Smiths son Jaden with a sly-eyed lack of fuss that matches nicely with his fathers) he applies for the internship program at Dean Witter where hell compete to be a stockbroker. Smith makes Chris a go-getter with a hint of sadness -- a bit of a fuddy-duddy but a smart dogged one. (He gets his foot in the door by solving a Rubiks Cube.) In The Pursuit of Happyness we dont just know Chris dreams. We know his bank account his tally of parking tickets his back taxes. The fact that hes African-American is there at the margins -- he would surely have gone to college had he come from a less hardscrabble background -- but the real issue is the subtler one of class mobility in America. Since the internship is unsalaried Chris is forced to survive by other measures and what this means is that the job is really geared to people whove already attained middle-class solidity. Chris has to pretend to be something hes not and the power of Smiths acting is in the gentle mounting fury with which he absorbs a hundred misperceptions and slights. As compelling as the film is it does have a rather single-minded one-ordeal-after-another Murphys Law quality. Yet the director Italys Gabriele Muccino lends a humane touch even to the running joke of Chris getting his bone scanners stolen and the plot is an inexorable chain of money logic Chris escape from a cabbie he cant afford to pay his looming tax crisis his move to a hotel and finally a homeless shelter. The lower he falls the more Smith endows him with a ragged nobility and will.
