This is epic fantasy for teenage boys as only Hollywood can do it with plenty of grotesque monsters and big explosions replacing characters and narrative. The films Big Baddie Kronos the Titan looks ready to go twelve rounds with Optimus Prime. The action is video game-inspired perhaps more than slightly influenced by the God of War series. The storyline bears a passing resemblance to that of Immortals although neither film does more than occasionally borrow from classic Greek mythology. Zeus undergoes a particularly vicious form of character assassination but director Jonathan Liebesman neednt worry since its unlikely hell sue. Wrath of the Titans is a sequel to 2010s Clash of the Titans (a remake of the 1981 feature of the same name). Like its predecessor Wrath of the Titans is interested exclusively in spectacle. The characters are uninteresting and the quest-based storyline is dumb but the filmmakers offer enough special effects-charged battles that one is occasionally tempted to concentrate on the things that work and forget about all the other stuff. Still theres a sense that Liebesman wants to make the central conflict epic but he is undone by time constraints. The movie breezes by at the fastest pace imaginable pausing only occasionally for moments of exposition. The climax which features an army of humans facing off against demonic creatures straight out of Tartarus can best be described as perfunctory. The movie picks up about a dozen years after the first one ended. Perseus (Sam Worthington) the slayer of the Kraken has become a hermit living in relative isolation as a fisherman with his only son Helius (John Bell). His wife Io has died because Gemma Arterton elected not to appear in yet another special effects-driven movie. Meanwhile on Olympus things arent going so well. People have stopped praying to the gods and this lack of faith is sapping their powers. Their ability to hold together the prison of the Titans is weakening and things get worse when Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and Ares (Edgar Ramirez) agree to a pact with Kronos to betray Zeus (Liam Neeson) and Poseidon (Danny Huston). Perseus is forced back into action to rescue Zeus from Tartarus. He takes with him Agenor (Toby Kebbell) the half-human son of Poseidon and Andromeda (Rosamund Pike) the princess (now queen) he saved from the Kraken. In Greek mythology (and the 1981 Clash of the Titans) Perseus and Andromeda were an item. With Io out of the way Wrath of the Titans falls into line although this relationship is unromantic even by male teen-oriented action movie standards. Sam Worthington is not an actor of great range but his popularity has made him a major casting choice over the last few years. In Wrath of the Titans he gives us a hero so brooding as to make Christian Bales Batman seem like the life of the party. During the 99-minute running time Perseus may not crack a single smile although he scowls a lot. Despite the he-man appearance it turns out hes not much of a fighter either. For much of the movie hes a punching bag for assorted monsters (chimera Cyclops the Minotaur etc.) and Ares. If Andromeda looks a little different than in the first movie thats because she is now played by Rosamund Pike (instead of Alexa Davalos who like Arterton determined that avoiding Wrath was a good career move). Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson return as Olympians once again fooling us into thinking there must be some substance here. Id love to know how many numbers preceded the decimal points on their paychecks. I must admit theres some pleasure to be had watching these two share the screen although its not sufficient to save the movie. Their dialogue doesnt reverberate with Shakespearean profundity. At times its more in line with the utterances of Ming the Merciless. Having endured the abomination that passed for a 3-D conversion on Clash of the Titans I elected to spare myself the torture of a repeat - you know the saying ""Fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me."" So I skipped the (3-D) press screening and saw it at a (2-D) regular showing. I therefore cannot speak to the quality of the hopefully improved 3-D but can say the version I saw was bright busy and chock full of chaotic action scenes. And if I was confused by the fights in 2-D I can only imagine what they looked like through the glasses. While watching Wrath of the Titans I tried to imagine how I might have felt about it with 30 years shaved off my age. As a teenager I probably would have thought of it as being cool but inconsequential. A diversion but nothing to dwell upon. I would have forgotten about it on the way home in the car. I cant say my overall impression as a 40-something is much different. Wrath of the Titans is not painful. Its noisy and frustratingly shallow but not boring. It typifies the kind of thing that happens when a movie exists solely because its predecessor was successful at the box office. Like Twilight this is a product made with a specific demographic in mind. The rest of us can shake our heads sadly and remember that not all movies - big budget or not - are as soulless as this one.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 30 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 223PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Ye gods theres a lot of hacking and many seismic eruptions in The Wrath of the Titans the latest 3-D action film that treats the Greek gods as action figures. The 3-D effects are better than in 2010s Clash of the Titans (a remake of a 1981 camp spectacle that re-imagined Greek myths through a Star Wars lens) but the newer film remains a series of monster wrestling matches with snippets of bellowed dialogue from middle-aged guys in long-haired wigs (Liam Neeson as Zeus Ralph Fiennes as Hades Danny Huston as Poseidon) who look like the remnants of a 70s metal group. Screen grab from the online trailer for the film ""Wrath of the Titans"" starring Sam Worthington Liam Neeson Ralph Fiennes and Rosamund Pike Movies Wrath of the Titans The official trailer Cast members Liam Neeson (R) Toby Kebbell (L) and Sam Worthington arrive for the world premiere of the film Wrath of the Titans in New York March 26 2012 Lucas Jackson/Reuters video Video Titan stars take over red carpet Rosamund Pike. Celebrity Video Rosamund Pike on motherhood and Titanhood Accents are varied - Australian American Irish English and for the monsters the usual subterranean Aaarggh. We pick up the action 10 years after the previous film where brawny demigod Perseus (Sam Worthington) is living the humble life of a widowed fisherman with his 10-year-old son Helius. Hes dragged back into the fray when Kronos the titan father of the Greek gods wants to overthrow Zeus and Poseidon allied with Hades and with Zeuss punk son Ares (Edgar Ramirez). Soon Zeus gets captured and tied up. The invariably irritable Ares and Hades are draining Zeuss immortal batteries feeding the power to Kronos. That means Perseus must go on another quest rally some allies descend to the underworld and straighten all this out. The allies include Princess Andromeda (Rosamund Pike cinched into form-fitting leather). Theres also Poseidons clownish offspring Agenor (Toby Kebbell channelling Russell Brand) and the artisan god Hephaestus (Bill Nighy too briefly) who has built a labyrinth that leads directly to the underworld. Clearly Hephaestus is designing a prototype of a future video game with lots of shifting floors and closing corridors that requires well-timed running and jumping. The monster fights occur at regular 10-minute intervals A three-headed chimera a trio of big baby cyclops and an underwhelming minotaur (a fat guy wearing bull horns) and then some mechanical four-armed creatures that appear to have been left over from a Transformers movie. Director Jonathan Liebesman (Battle Los Angeles) swings the cameras between ground-level point-of-view shots and overhead images of smouldering wreckage. In the underworld scenes theres the occasional foray into Michael Bay-style which-way-is-upright? confusion. By the time Perseus and his pals have freed Zeus (now looking like an unjolly Santa Claus) Kronos is aroused. After all the build-up I was looking forward to seeing who played him but rather than a character the father of the gods turned out to be a CGI-created lava-spewing mountain-sized creature with smudgy features and all the eloquence of a belch. He looked too much like the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man from Ghostbusters or the Poop Monster from Kevin Smiths Dogma to be scary although he does seem terrifyingly and unrepentantly messy. That might make him the real hero to the adolescent boys for whom the movie is apparently designed.

Credit Warner Brothers Pictures Hey Perseus Youve just dispatched Medusa a horde of Furies and the dreaded Kraken and rescued Andromeda and the city of Argos. Where are you off to now? Fishing?Seems reasonable for this demigod (Sam Worthington) the adopted son of a fisherman. But when youre the hero of the 2010 ""Clash of the Titans"" remake -- which made Warner Brothers almost 500 million worldwide -- its inevitable that your real dad Zeus (Liam Neeson) will hit you up for help.Previously he and Hades (Ralph Fiennes) threatened mankind; now in ""Wrath of the Titans"" mans faith in the gods is waning and Olympian fat is on the fire. To remain immortal Hades has allied himself with the petulant Ares (Edgar Ramirez) to free Kronos the titan imprisoned in deepest Tartarus. Hi-yo PegasusThats about all the plot you get (or need) in this action spectacle. What you get in abundance as before are its true stars monsters in digital (and in some theaters 3-D) detail notably a chimera; three huge Cyclopes; Makhai (minions with two heads and torsos); and Kronos himself a lumbering Gargantua of living lava all engaged in furious fairly bloodless PG-13 conflict.Of course in a tradition dating to the original ""Clash of the Titans"" from 1981 you also get lots of British thespians hamming it up with trifling dialogue; new recruits include Bill Nighy as Hephaestus and Rosamund Pike as Andromeda (now a warrior queen). At least it doesnt take itself too seriously. There are also soldiers fireballs smoke and sand. But not much to think about when the dust clears.""Wrath of the Titans"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has copious but largely harmless conflagration.

But really so what? Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? I would have settled for cardboard props and sock puppets had ""Wrath of the Titans"" invested in a few interesting characters or a compelling story. In that sense little has changed since the first film or for that matter since the campy 1981 original. This big-budget production will probably look terrific in IMAX but what youll mostly see in ""Wrath"" is the spectacle of Hollywood spending money in all the wrong places. Returning as the half-god Perseus is Sam Worthington whose wooden acting and shaggy new coif are practically begging for comparisons to Harry Hamlin the bland looker who originated the role. This time Perseus must rescue his father Zeus (again played by a stentorian Liam Neeson) from the hellish labyrinth Tartarus where Kronos is feeding on Zeus power. On his mission Perseus meets the rascally Agenor (Toby Kebbell ""Rocknrolla"") the warrior Queen Andromeda (the excellent Rosamund Pike here purely decorative) and the dotty old-timer Hephaestus (Bill Nighy sounding inexplicably like a Yorkshire dock worker). These stock characters are a bore though at least Ralph Fiennes back as the wounded villain Hades and Venezuelan newcomer Edgar Ramirez as the jealous god Ares bring a tinge of humanity to their roles. VideoTrailer Wrath of the Titans New director Jonathan Liebesman (""Battle Los Angeles"") is a welcome replacement for Louis Leterrier mixing high-tech animation with old-fashioned camerawork -- low angles for the big creatures tight shots for combat -- to good effect. And the 3-D conversion is absolutely perfect. But if thats all you want for your 15 may this ""Wrath"" be upon you. advertisement | advertise on newsday PLOT The half-god Perseus must rescue his father Zeus from the underworld.

A two-headed dragon. A fanged serpent. A brutish 50-foot Cyclops. Another Republican debate? No its ""Wrath of the Titans"" a journey back to an ancient time when gods walked the earth monsters breathed fire and stout-hearted warriors wore adorable leather cheerleader skirts with strappy gladiator sandals. While a serviceable action-fantasy that passes the time the sequel to the 2010 remake of the 1981 film ""Clash of the Titans"" is a little light on fantastical creatures a bit heavy on the campy acting (hey Bill Nighy This isnt supposed to be an off-Broadway comedy) and given to many painful instances in which characters duel with awkward clanking rusty weapons called ""words."" We begin with the half-human half-god Perseus (Sam Worthington the first actor in history to star in 3.5 billion dollars worth of box-office hits without anyone noticing him). He is now a widower and a fisherman raising his young son Helius (John Bell) and declining an invitation from his father Zeus (Liam Neeson) to get back in the war -game. Zeus complains that no one prays anymore (talk about blaming the customer) causing the gods to lose their immortality. And Zeus brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes) is preparing to join forces with Kronos their vengeful father and leader of the Titans. Kronos look is mildly scary Think the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man re-created in charcoal briquets. In the underworld Zeus seems surprised that Hades is still miffed at him. Something about being tricked into permanent banishment to hell is reducing Hades fraternal spirit. Zeus ""We must forget the past brother."" Oh OK. Put er there Somewhere along the line Zeus other bro Poseidon gets killed but hes only played by journeyman actor Danny Huston so youll hardly notice. To take on Kronos Perseus hits the road to the underworld dungeon of Tartarus with a couple of friends He picks up Queen Andromeda played by Rosamund Pike and Agenor a comedy-sidekick thief half-god son of Poseidon and fast talker. I nearly choked on my Raisinets when I thought Agenor was Russell Brand who after ""Arthur"" should be confined to the movie equivalent of Hades but glad tidings Its just Toby Kebbell who is merely mildly irritating. All of them run into Hephaestus who instead of being the mighty smith of the gods is played by Nighy as a cranky nutter with a junk emporium. He brings an unwelcome ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" goofiness to the proceedings but Worthington bless him continues to play it straight and with his new Greg Brady haircut he looks a bit less like the bricklayer he once was. His acting range continues to run all the way from alpha to beta. An actor is only as good as his script though. When the dialogue isnt written in caveman declarative its written to refresh the audiences memory in lines such as ""Hades you are the god of the Underworld"" and ""You remember I am your son."" That line comes from Ares (Edgar Ramirez) who by the way is the god of war which makes it a little bit hilarious when everyone keeps asking him to calm his temper and stop being mean to his dad Zeus against whom he sides with Hades in the intra-Olympus spat. Randomly the gang keeps encountering magical creatures some of which are cool to look at (like the gang of one-eyed giants and the beast with two legs and two back-to-back torsos and heads). And the fight scenes that rely on big special effects as well as the labyrinth-like tower that leads to Tartarus are depicted reasonably well by director Jonathan Liebesman who lacks the freewheeling flair of the first films captain Louis Leterrier. Liebesman doesnt bother much with making sense Whenever someone needs a magical power that could yield some nifty CGI he gets it unexplained. An army commanded by Andromeda girds for battle -- then stands around watching Perseus go at it with Kronos. A major characters U-turn occurs after someone simply requests it. ""Wrath of the Titans"" suggests a franchise that isnt trying very hard and I dont really expect a sequel. But if it does happen I fear itll be even less of an event ""Tiff of the Titans.""

Not necessarily any sway over us puny mortals but the ability to singularly command our imaginations with tales of their menace mercy and might. Much in the same way that last months Journey to the Center of the Earth sequel cherry-picked fantastical elements which had individually enchanted readers of three different novels for years before Wrath of the Titans - this months sequel to 2010s remake of 1981s Clash of the Titans - wedges together the heavenly figures of Zeus Hades Perseus Poseidon and Ares with creatures like the Minotaur the Cyclops and the Chimera for a more-is-more approach to long-ago legends who still retain some cultural recognition and yet find themselves rendered utterly disposable in the face of the mighty god of commerce. Its ten years after the events of Clash and the gods are in fact losing their power as widespread belief in them falters. Brothers Zeus (Liam Neeson) Poseidon (Danny Huston) and Hades (Ralph Fiennes) grow fearful that they will not be able to stop those titans held within the subterranean walls of Tartarus and in traveling to the prison of the underworld they are soon betrayed by Ares (Edgar Ramirez) Zeus more neglected son and the god of war eager to see Hell unleashed on Earth. It falls to Zeus other son kraken-killing demigod Perseus (Sam Worthington) to set aside his single father ways in order to rescue his own dad and effectively ward off the apocalyptic outcome of Ares actions. What follows is your usual modern quest movie modeled less on classic adventure stories and more on Billys dizzying outings in ""The Family Circus."" Perseus is forced to couple himself with the likes of Queen Andromeda (Rosamund Pike capably replacing Alexa Davalos) and Poseidons son Agenor (Toby Kebbell). The latter gets to split comic-relief duties with a winningly hammy Bill Nighy who gets to send our trio of heroes into a shifting labyrinth of his own design to fetch three godly weapons of his own making as they alone will combine into a weapon capable of taking down a reawakened Kronos fiery father to the aforementioned gods. Its the post-Pirates blueprint to a T with oversized foes threatening our heroes at every turn in their nakedly arbitrary pursuit of Important Items. Seemingly written by committee but only credited to three men Wraths screenplay sees our gods pointing out to one another the significance of an underground dungeon with which they are surely already familiar. There is admittedly a noble effort made to string together several generations of daddy issues between gods and men as Zeus and Hades struggle to stop the father whom they themselves had imprisoned eons ago and as Perseus is torn between protecting his own son and saving his once-mighty father but that thematic significance neither drives nor defines this well-oiled machine. Were talking first and foremost about a framework for mythical melees on which director Jonathan Liebesman (Battle Los Angeles) does not skimp. He impresses with an early tracking shot as Perseus takes to the rooftops in order to better pummel a fire-spewing chimera attacking his village only to punctuate that beat with a mad blur of mayhem and a fleeting cheat in which the aspect ratio momentarily shifts to make the creatures fanged tail seem to pop off the screen that much more on a 3-D viewing (the overall quality of which otherwise exceeds Clashs notoriously hasty conversion). The aforementioned labyrinth sequence may be contrived in its resolution but it boasts a tension rare to the proceedings and the lava-slinging climax that pits our hero and his trusty Pegasus against the towering Kronos certainly doesnt lack for scale; in fact its arguably closer in spirit to the Ray Harryhausen spectacle of yore than Clash could claim despite its identical plotting. In between Perseus faces skirmishes with multiple cyclopses an unimpressive minotaur and fleet-footed two-torsoed makhai soldiers and while an audiences emotional investment in these endeavors hardly factors in Worthington remains a good sport when throwing himself into battle with opponents both imaginary and lavishly costumed. Neeson Fiennes and Huston opt for their default levels of gravitas leaving Ramirez as the pouty odd man out while Pike serves as steely-eyed eye candy in an undeniable boys club. The question stands is it entertaining? Well thats a tough call at a time when the bar for modern sword-and-sandal pics has been set so low with the advancement of digital effects rendering beasts in more realistic and yet less riveting fashion. There isnt a surprise in sight nor any real sweep to its craftsmanship but the film doesnt drag either in doling out familiar sensations. Does it hold its own against its immediate predecessor? (And did that film hold its own in the shadow of its predecessor?) In a marketplace most recently defined by the popularity of the glossy and garish Immortals and 300 Wrath is about as enjoyable as a film whose every frame is designed to be forgotten could be. Ye gods indeed.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr DEFEATING MONSTERS Sam Worthington as Perseus in Wrath of the Titans (Warner Bros. Pictures) B- Wrath of the Titans Genre Fantasy Action/Adventure; Starring Liam Neeson Sam Worthington; Director Jonathan Liebesman; Release Date Wide 03/30/2012; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted April 3 2012 -- 1200 AM EDT Everything is on fire in Wrath of the Titans. Sam Worthington as the mighty Perseus (otherwise known as the dude who slayed the Kraken) takes on a two-headed griffin-like creature that trashes a village with its incendiary breath. The spears and tridents that various warriors keep clutching glow in their fists like molten iron. And the films most deluxe monster is Kronos (father of Zeus Hades and Poseidon) who after being overthrown and imprisoned has now risen up in the form of a really really gigantic giant made entirely of volcanic rock and ash with humungous arms that disintegrate and reconstitute themselves as they throw off fiery streams of lava. For a movie thats basically all warmed-over pseudo-mythology and special effects Wrath of the Titans is certainly more fun in its solemnly junky way than John Carter. It may also be a little more fun than its cheeseball predecessor the 2010 remake of Clash of the Titans. A lot of the digital effects are quite good though that prompts me to ask Why do the camerawork and editing have to be so jittery? In the old days movies used to invite us to sit back and gaze at monsters to really drink them in. The beasts didnt need to be photographed as if we were watching Saving Private Kraken. The other limitation of Wrath of the Titans is that the dialogue is mostly made of wet cardboard. What there is of it consists of actors like Liam Neeson Ralph Fiennes and Edgar Ramirez (as the evil Ares) staring at each other and saying ""Youre my brother and you betrayed me"" or ""Youre my son and you betrayed me"" We get it The gods are losing their power theres a whole lot of betrayal going on and this means somehow that the world is about to end. Its up to Perseus to amass an army to fight Kronos and the forces of chaos. Maybe its just my imagination but Sam Worthington seems to be getting slightly less stiff as an actor. He now smiles occasionally and hes at least risen to the soulful inexpressiveness of the young Ryan ONeal. For a movie like Wrath of the Titans which is basically Gladiator crossed with Lord of the Rings crossed with a special-effects demo reel (call it Lord of the Rinky-Dink) hes the perfect actor. And thats because he never threatens to overshadow all that fire. B? Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of fantasy violence and action Running time 1 hours 39 minutes Opens today nationwide Also new to the franchise is Edgar Ramirez (HBOs Carlos) as the vicious Ares who hates his father Zeus (Liam Neeson) and his half-human brother Perseus (Sam Worthington). Bill Nighy joins the cast as Hephaestus a fallen god who falls with finality too soon.He brings much-needed comic zest to a film that lumbers with so many serious bellowing performances.Neeson Worthington and Ralph Fiennes as Hades reprise their Titan roles in this reboot set a decade after the first film in which Perseus defeated the monstrous Kraken.Now widowed Perseus is living as a fisherman and raising his son Helius (John Bell). But upheaval lurks when hes approached by Zeus for help.Apparently humanity isnt as devoted to worshiping the gods as they were and the pantheon is in danger of losing its immortality. Armageddon looms.Perseus initially avoids entering the fray but soon hes thrust into a struggle involving Hades and Ares who have joined forces and captured Zeus aiming to siphon off his godly powers.Though the special effects are sharper than those in Clash of the Titans the dialogue is equally uninspired.Nuances of jealousy resentment and revenge are lost in the thuddingly dull screenplay. Watching Perseus ride off on winged Pegasus its hard not to long for a similar escape from Titans relentless blustery wrath. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Two years after flexing his divinity in the worldwide hit Clash of the Titans the Olympian boss-man Zeus (Liam Neeson) frets that he and his clan have outlived their grandeur. In the minds of the once-worshipful now agnostic humans the deities have devolved from supreme beings to action figures. ""Without prayer"" Zeus muses ""we gods lose our power"" -- they cant intimidate people who dont believe in them. So he and his brothers Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and Poseidon (Danny Huston) sit around Olympus mewling and bickering like deposed CEOs at a Florida retirement condo. If the fate of the world and the heavens too werent at stake their humbled status might be the premise for a sitcom not The Golden Girls but The Golden Gods. Wrath of the Titans like its predecessor is a slightly-better-than-OK mashing of one of historys great literary troves the Greek myths. The family rivalries -- Cronos castrating his father Uranus then getting killing off by his son Zeus whose dalliances with human women resulted in a half-dozen or so bastard half-god offspring -- have stoked three millennia of bedtime stories that left children horrified fascinated and agog. Some of those kids grew up to be film directors who know a good story when they hear one if not a good movie when they try to make one. (READ Corlisss review of Clash of the Titans) Jonathan Liebesman the South African schlockmeister who imagined an alien invasion in last years Battle Los Angeles is no De Mille or Spielberg but he and the screenwriters (Dan Mazeau David Leslie Johnson and Greg Berlanti) are canny enough to perk up the drama by importing a monster from the Greek bestiary -- the Chimera the Minotaur a few Cyclopses -- for a rousing wrassling match whenever the proceedings get too wordy. Unencumbered by artistic ambition and clocking in at a brisk 90 minutes (before the endless end credits begin) Wrath radiates the straight-forward straight-faced pleasures of the mytho-muscular epics like Hercules and Jason and the Argonauts produced in Europe a half-century ago. Its kid stuff for bookworms a Classics comic book brought to fitfully vigorous life. As Clash did Wrath opens with Zeuss favorite spawn Perseus (Sam Worthington) toiling as a humble fisherman. A little ashamed of his paternal lineage the young hero ignores his god-fathers flattery that ""Being half-human makes you stronger than a god not weaker."" For Perseus being a good parent means staying at home with his young son Helios (John Bell). Finally acceding to Zeuss pleas to join forces against Cronos and Hades as if he were a teenager asked to go on a business trip with his father -- all right Dad Ill help you save the world -- Perseus hooks up with Princess Andromeda (Rosamund Pike) and the mischievous Agenor (Toby Kebbell) one of Poseidons sons. Along for the ride is the white winged horse Pegasus also sired by Poseidon; the gods werent too picky about their sexual partners. (READ Corliss review of the myth-illogical Immortals) Though the film boasts a coherently rusty look as if the sets from the first movie were left out in the rain for a couple of years the acting styles on display are entertainingly discontiguous. Neeson and Fiennes repeating their roles from Clash (and metaphorically the fraught hero and sadistic villain they played in Schindlers List) are Teflon stars; no embarrassment sticks to their serioso commitment to what might seem ludicrous material. Intoning lofty platitudes while importantly stroking his cotton-candy beard Neeson is a figure of compromised majesty. Fiennes exuding sulfurous resolve as Hades cadges some sympathy for a god who is asked to align with Zeus the younger brother who consigned him to the lower depths. The rest of the cast is all over the place geographically and thespically. Worthington the Australian hunk from Avatar lets his accent wander from Down Under to middle-American to faux-British. Kebbell perhaps encouraged to be the comic relief seems to be channeling Russell Brand doing a Freddie Mercury impression. As Ares the warrior-god who resolves to kill Perseus in front of Helios so that the child will ""know what it feels like when someone takes your father away from you"" Edgar Ramirez -- such a magnetic force as the terrorist Carlos the Jackal in Olivier Assayass 2010 bio-pic Carlos -- fulminates a little too furiously; apparently he didnt get the memo that in this movie bad guys dont preen. Neither did Bill Nighy who makes a late appearance as the crafty Hephaestus. But then Nighy known to mall audiences as Davy Jones from the Pirates of the Caribbean films is always madly delightfully mannered -- as if other Brit actors of his generation trained at RADA and he went to Clown College. By the end when Cronos materializes as a mountain-high beast of sooty cloud and molten rock three generations of titans are engaged in a volcanic family feud. As if promising an end to the franchise Zeus declares that ""There will be no more sacrifices no more gods."" But Hades provides a hint of another sequel when after acknowledging that ""All my power is spent"" he adds delphically ""Who knows? I might be stronger without it."" Who knows? The same worldwide audience that paid nearly a half-billion dollars to see Clash of the Titans. If moviegoers show the same fidelity to this movie then ancient Greeces most prominent senior citizens will be back in two years for one more Crash Stash or just plain old Bash.

Share Print Save to your profile By Reuben Pereira | Special to The Miami Herald3/29/2012 Editor rating 1.5 Few would argue against Clash of the Titans being anything but trash what with its cheesy dialogue and anorexic plot. Still it was at least entertaining trash thanks in part to the remarkable action sequences and the thrill of watching Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes ham it up as warring gods Zeus and Hades. Sadly those thrills all but evaporate in Wrath of the Titans the loud and agonizingly dull sequel that inherits all the problems that plagued its predecessor -- and then some. Set a decade after the events of the previous film Perseus (charisma vacuum Sam Worthington) is now a fisherman living with his son after the death of his wife. Though appearing to be done with the heroic nonsense at first Perseus bolts into rescue mode after daddy Zeus (Liam Neeson) gets imprisoned in the underworld by Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and Ares (Edgar Ramirez) who plan on using the old mans power to unleash Kronos a colossal lava monster that makes the Kraken look like Mickey Mouse. A hero cant possibly travel alone in this type of swords-and-sandals actioner so Perseus is joined by crop of stock archetypes posing as characters. These include warrior queen Andromeda (Rosamund Pike) who by the time the film is done will be expected to fall madly in love with Perseus; fellow demi-God Agenon (the usually reliable Toby Kebbell) who functions as the films comic relief; and a few unfortunate souls who solely exist to get mauled in grisly fashion by a Cyclops Minotaur or a scenery-chewing Bill Nighy. Nighy who showboats as Ephestus a crackpot inventor who holds the key to save Zeus may be over the top but at least he seems to be trying. I couldnt say the same for Neeson and Fiennes who collect their hefty paychecks by spending a good chunk of the film resolving their big brother-little brother issues and then delivering ridiculous lines like ""We had powers like this when we were young. Lets have some fun"" The biggest disappointment however is seeing the gifted Ramirez (Carlos) wasting his talent grunting and pouting as one the most under-cooked villains in recent memory. Director Jonathan Liebesman who takes over directorial duties from Louis Letterner brings the same rote chaotic style he employed in his previous film Battle L.A. meaning the action scenes are energetic but disorienting and unnecessarily infected with shivery-arm syndrome. While this keeps the attention away from the cardboard cutout characters it chokes the film from offering up any suspense whatsoever. Even Clash of the Titans silly as it was had the Medusa sequence. Wrath of the Titans might not be as embarrassing as such recent big budget misfires as Green Lantern Cowboys and Aliens or Battle L.A. but its existence is frivolous.

"Wrath of the Titans movie review by-the-numbers sequel lacks interest adventure - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs By-the-numbers Wrath of the Titans lets down cast of able performers ? 1/2March 29 2012|By Mark Olsen Special to Tribune NewspapersDid the ancient Greeks think in terms of sequels? The ongoing adventures of their mythological gods certainly lend themselves easily to serialized entertainment. And so following the box-office success of 2010s ""Clash of The Titans"" comes the more-of-the-same sequel ""Wrath of The Titans.""With Jonathan Liebesman as the director this time the film lacks inspiration or zest in storytelling performance or action. This is pure product a movie desperately without energy or enthusiasm of any kind.The new story opens with our hero Perseus (Sam Worthington) as a widower and single father his curly proto-mullet signaling that he has given up on soldiering and is determined to live as a simple fisherman. That is until a multiheaded creature invades his village and he reveals the powers he possesses as half man half god.His father Zeus (Liam Neeson) is himself engaged in a battle with his brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and full-god son Ares (Edgar Ramirez) who are plotting to release the imprisoned Kronos which would let loose an apocalypse. Or some such.There is a lot of business in the film written by Dan Mazeau and David Leslie Johnson from a story by Greg Berlanti Johnson and Mazeau regarding powers and loyalties lost siphoned and regained a jumble of plot mechanics that seem guided mostly by the expediency of a given scene.Early implications of a subtext on religious faith -- the gods lose their powers if the people do not pray to them -- are quickly disregarded.The supporting cast is full of interesting performers given precious little to do. Bill Nighy plays a wily inventor/architect not unlike his role in ""The Hitchhikers Guide to The Galaxy."" Rosamund Pike replaces Alexa Davalos as Andromeda who has been transformed from a lady-in-waiting type to a headstrong battle-ready empress.Ramirez brings an unexpected charismatic sensuality to his warrior role at times seeming like a worker on the factory floor pacing himself too quickly compared to others on the line -- apparently no one told him to keep a lid on it.Likewise Toby Kebbell as half-god Agenor brings a badly needed comic energy. Lunchtimes around the catering cart with this bunch likely had more drama humor and action that the film they all ended up in.Although the film clocks in at little more than an hour and a half its pacing feels off both fast-moving and terribly slow at the same time. (And yes the kitschy mechanical owl from the Harry Hamlin/Laurence Olivier 1981 original ""Clash"" again makes an inert cameo.)As the story jumps from set-piece to set-piece one monster to the next there is no sense of ongoing adventure just a checklist being ticked off. The mythology of the ancient Greeks is ultimately no match for the industrial imperatives of modern Hollywood.Wrath of the Titans -- 1 1/2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for intense sequences of fantasy violence and action)Running time 139Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Life Skill 201 Washing a baseball capLongtime nursing home operators must face trial judge rules10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesThe top films at the North American box officeApril 15 2012Hunger Wrath split B.O. bragging rightsApril 1 2012Headin` For BroadwayMarch 18 1990A Timely Trail Of TearsSeptember 11 1988Find More Stories AboutFilmGodWrathTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0328-wrath-of-the-titans-20120330,0,6746612.story",200,wrathofthetitans15,wrathofthetitans,chicagotribune

Video courtesy of the Weinstein Company. (A previous version of the description erroneously described this movie). By Joe Morgenstern March 29 2012 452 p.m. ET ""Bully"" doesnt dwell on the bullies themselves. Thats fair enough; we know what they do and at least in a general sense why they do it. The subjects of this valuable documentary are the bullied those who suffer cruel and all-too-usual punishment in our middle schools and high schools for being different and defenseless. One of them a 16-year-old girl named Kelby offers a different way of looking at rain. ""The world"" she says ""has taken in so much sadness that it cant hold it anymore."" Watching the film may cause scattered showers in the region of the eyes but it should also provoke dismay with a succession of school administrators who respond to the problem of bullying by denying it sidestepping it or shrugging it off with an attitude that a grief-stricken father in rural Georgia characterizes as ""kids will be kids boys will be boys theyre just cruel at this age."" ENLARGE Alex a student in Sioux City Iowa in Bully. The Weinstein Company Yes they are cruel as the father David Long knows all too well. In 2009 his 17-year-old son Tyler committed suicide after years of abuse by his classmates and according to Mr. Long and his wife Tina indifference by school officials. Another expert in such cruelty is the films central character 12-year-old Alex a gentle middle-school student in Sioux City Iowa. In a culture that celebrates standardized good looks he has prominent lips that prompt his classmates to call him ""fish face."" In an era of rampant friending he is friendless. Alex tells heartbreaking stories of severe and systematic bullying. ""I feel like I belong somewhere else"" he says wistfully. And we get to see what hes talking about when during school-bus rides his schoolmates punch him and insult him with chilling flippancy even though they know theyre being photographed. (The film was directed by Lee Hirsch and written by Mr. Hirsch and Cynthia Lowen.) Heartbreak abounds. In Tuttle Okla. Kelby the girl with the alternative take on meteorology has been bullied unmercifully and her family has been treated as outcasts ever since she came out as a lesbian. In Yazoo County Miss. a 14-year-old honor student JaMeya still faces an uncertain fate after ceaseless bullying led her to bring her mothers loaded handgun on to a school bus and brandish it to intimidate her tormentors; at first she was charged with multiple felony counts and faced decades in prison. In Perkins Okla. Kirk and Laura Smalley are launching a national campaign against bullying after the suicide of their 11-year-old son Ty. (The films power is undercut by its narrow geographic focus which seems to associate bullying with conservative or working-class areas in red states. The filmmakers could easily have found similar cases involving the children of urban sophisticates.) What ""Bully"" says about our species is dismaying if unsurprising; many boys--and girls--will prey ruthlessly on their weak classmates especially at the age of raging hormones and incomplete brain circuitry. What it says about some educators in positions of power is troubling. Instead of embracing a policy of zero tolerance to protect the students entrusted to their care several--though not all--of the functionaries in the film seem baffled by what amounts to an epidemic with no moral compass to guide them. All of which makes it disappointing to say the least that the Motion Picture Association of America decided to give the film an R rating--requiring minors to be accompanied by a parent or guardian--because of the brief use of explicit language. To counter the MPAAs decision the films distributor the Weinstein Company is sending it out as unrated a tactic that will gain access to some theater chains but not to others. If reason prevails the film will be seen and seen widely. ""Bully"" is a teaching tool and the language in question turns on words routinely heard or used by the very kids who should be seeing it both for enlightenment and solace. ENLARGE Former Maldives leader Mohamed Nasheed in The Island President. Samuel Goldwyn Films The Island President The docs have it this week. Jon Shenks fascinating documentary feature ""The Island President"" personalizes the threat of global warming and nationalizes it too by focusing on Mohamed Nasheed the former president of the Maldives. A sparsely inhabited though frequently touristed string of some 1200 islands in the Indian Ocean the Maldives is the lowest-lying nation on the planet. Since it might be the first nation to be swamped by a significant rise in sea level the Maldives could become the canary islands by providing early warning of calamity to come. (A democratically elected reformer who ended his predecessors three-decade rule in 2009 Mr. Nasheed was still president when the film was shot but left office in February amid violent demonstrations and pressure from the army and police.) The filmmaker could hardly have found a more alluring setting--azure atolls dazzlingly white beaches a capital chockablock with modern buildings that seem from a distance to have been Photoshopped onto some pristine tropical isle--or a more appealing apostle of the anticarbon cause. Eloquent short and wiry with a quick wit and a high-wattage smile Mr. Nasheed once called attention to his nations vulnerability by holding a cabinet session underwater and pledged to make the Maldives carbon-neutral within a decade through the use of green technology. He also used overheated rhetoric on occasion; after seven months in office he likened global warming to a Nazi invasion. (From a few concerning but anecdotal accounts in the film its impossible to know if the Maldives are already losing land to rising sea levels.) Mr. Shenks cameras follow his subject to Denmark. There during his first year in office Mr. Nasheed navigates with considerable aplomb the perilous waters of international diplomacy at the Copenhagen Climate Summit. He knows that he represents as he puts it ""a bunch of small islands with no clout."" But he wants to shake things up and he does attracting media attention with impassioned appeals for an agreement on reducing carbon emissions. His clout deficit becomes apparent when he finally gets to meet Chinese premier Wen Jiabao--a Chinese security guard turns the camera away before a word is said by either man. After the conference has ended though Mr. Nasheed is able to call his mother from his car and tell her that the assembled nations reached an agreement in principle albeit no requirement for action. Thats high drama for a mother and son from such a low country. Perseus braves the treacherous underworld to rescue his father Zeus captured by his son Ares and brother Hades who unleash the ancient Titans upon the world. Video courtesy of Warner Bros. Wrath of the Titans When the Titans last clashed two years ago their dialogue was idiotic their plot machinations impenetrable and their 3-D process an add-on disaster. The best I can say for this sequel--not such a bad best--is that youll want to keep your 3-D glasses on. Some of the action sequences and a few of the performances are enjoyable enough to make up for the dialogue which has been upgraded to cheerfully absurd and the plot which has been simplified to the point of actual coherence. (Sam Worthingtons demigod Perseus would rather live a quiet fishermans life with his young son than save the universe but the Titans are fighting among themselves and the universe needs all the help it can get.) ENLARGE Sam Worthington in Wrath of the Titans Warner Bros. Pictures Among the many and clangorous effects the most special pit Perseus against a three-headed Chimera; take him and his companions-in-arms through a labyrinth whose sliding slabs suggest the interior of a titanic Rubiks Cube; and plunge him vertiginously down into the bowels of the earth. Among the additions to a cast that once again includes Liam Neeson as Zeus and Ralph Fiennes as Hades the standouts are Bill Nighy as Hephaestus a riotously funny blacksmith to the gods (how does Mr. Nighy come up with such wonderful stuff?); Toby Kebbell as Agenor Poseidons long-lost and charmingly raffish son; and Rosamund Pike as Queen Andromeda. The queen doesnt get to lead men into battle as much as she might--you wouldnt mistake her for Henry V at Agincourt--but the marvelous and beauteous Ms. Pike gets to do a succession of reaction shots that would charm the eyes off both heads of an Amphisbaena. DVD Focus ENLARGE Heathers (1988) Three queen-bee bullies--all of them named Heather--get their comeuppance and then some in this now-classic dark comedy about the cruelties of high-school life. Winona Ryder is Veronica sick of the clique she has joined and wishing its members were dead. Christian Slater is the mysterious--and possibly psychotic--J.D. who gives Veronica an education in advanced malevolence that she could never have anticipated. The three Heathers are played by Shannen Doherty Lisanne Falk and Kim Walker. Michael Lehmann directed from an original screenplay by Daniel Waters. Silent Running (1972) A sci-fi classic with a green message directed by Douglas Trumbull who supervised the special photographic effects in ""Blade Runner"" ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" and last year ""The Tree of Life."" At a time when Earths vegetation has been destroyed by pollution and overcrowding a biologist played by Bruce Dern serves as a steward of precious forests that are flourishing aboard a giant spaceship. The scuttling little droids that serve him were progenitors of R2-D2 and WALLE. The script with its unfortunate downbeat ending was written by Deric Washburn Michael Cimino and Steven Bochco. Still Crazy (1998) Bill Nighy plays a fallen demigod of rock in this British comedy about middle-age losers trying to reassemble their 1970s band Strange Fruit for a 20th-anniversary concert. Mr. Nighy is hilarious and touching as Ray the groups ravaged lead singer whos coming up on his 50th birthday. The brilliant script by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais an original score and delicious production numbers make a mercifully incomplete mockery of glam rocks ancient excesses. ""Still Crazy"" directed by Brian Gibson (""Whats Love Got to Do With It?"") sings a bittersweet song of aging yearning and unlikely reconciliation.

Wrath of the Titans is a good example of that. Shari L. Gross Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Every family has its squabbles but when the relatives are a race of powerful deities things can get out of hand. ""Wrath of the Titans"" imagines a multigenerational tag-team match between the half-human demigod Perseus (Sam Worthington) his feuding father Zeus (Liam Neeson) and uncle Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and their father the primordial titan Kronos (a mountain-sized humanoid mass of special-effects smoke and lava). Though the film shortchanges us on the promise of its title providing only one titan it is overkill in most other regards. Having limbered up by demolishing Southern California in ""Battle Los Angeles"" director Jonathan Liebesman obliterates ancient Greece in a chain of combat and action scenes of thermonuclear proportions. Like Michael Corleone in ""Godfather III"" just when Perseus thinks hes out of the family business he gets pulled back in. Having defeated the fearsome sea monster Kraken in ""Clash of the Titans"" he has downscaled to a modest life in retirement as a fisherman. His relationship with his father is frosty. You know how it is with gods. Theyre distant judgmental over-entitled and demand a constant stream of tribute. Additionally Zeus forced himself on Perseus mother and stiffed her on child support. So when Neeson appears in full-bearded Gandalf/Dumbledore drag to beg for his sons aid in the looming struggle Perseus sulks. His real motive for wading into the crisis in heaven is that the gods strife is causing awful collateral damage on Earth. Eruptions explosions earthquakes. They could have had a good joke here with an upheaval knocking the arms off the Venus de Milo but you cant have everything. Since Perseus is half-divine he is susceptible to flattery. Zeus informs him that ""being half human makes you stronger than a god"" and warns that when men cease to believe their gods disappear. Not wanting half of himself to vanish and hoping to impress comely blue-eyed warrior queen Andromeda (Rosamund Pike) he re-enlists flying into battle on his winged horse. Plot summary Bang boom smash wallop. There is a Cyclops battle a minotaur battle attacks by creatures like harpies and a mad dash through the hell-prison Tartarus which ceaselessly reforms itself like a giant limestone Rubiks cube. Warner Bros. Courtesy Warner Bros. Ent. Inc. Sam Worthington and Liam Neeson in ""Wrath of the Titans."" Danny Huston aims for gravitas and sincerity in his portrayal of Poseidon. As Ares Edgar Ramirez (""Carlos the Jackal"") scowls mightily. Wily Bill Nighy seeing this cheese-fest for what it is dons the craziest wig and chin whiskers this side of a ZZ Top tribute band and camps it up as Hephaestus the armorer of the gods. Worthington hasnt proved himself to be much of an actor outside of James Cameron movies and Cameron got a good performance out of Tom Arnold. Here Worthington speaks in his native Australian drawl and does the usual run/punch/grimace action-hero routine well enough. Neeson and his ""Schindlers List"" co-star Fiennes deserve some sort of award simply for being able to look at each other in their togas and not burst into laughter. To utter lines like ""Ares my son"" and not crack up is an achievement.

More about Wrath of the Titans >> In this clamorous and compacted sequel to 2010s Clash of the Titans theres little left for Perseus (Sam Worthington) to do except save the world. The old Gods notably Zeus (Liam Neeson) and Hades (Ralph Fiennes) are dying. Its easy to tell. With their long gray hair and beards they look like a sad reunion tour of Crosby and Stills. Theres a distressing amount of faux-mythology youre supposed to digest but all that matters is that in the end - and at the end - Perseus must vanquish Kronos a mountain of molten flame. But first there is a series of pointless time-killing quests Perseus undertakes with Agenor (Toby Kebbell) and Andromeda (Rosamund Pike). Fanboys will no doubt mourn the absence of Gemma Arterton Worthingtons love interest in the first Olympiad. One of the first things Perseus says to Andromeda is ""My wife died."" How come this is a personal detail you only share with the hot blonde dude? Although Perseus is famously half-human half-god his only discernible power is consistently incredible luck. Time and again he faces unbeatable foes - cyclops minotaur dragons - and avoids death by the width of a DVD (which is where this film should go with all due haste). At least the use of 3D in Wrath of the Titans is better than in the original. Of course thats not saying much since the first time around the 3D technology seems to have been left in the hands of Mrs. Schaefers 4th grade class. Rarely has a film so equally balanced macho and nacho but Wrath does leave us with a few valuable lessons a.) fratricide is a nasty business best left to the Greeks and b) fighting fire with fire may sound good but it turns out to be a really stupid idea. OK you also learn something about flying horses but I dont want to spoil the ending. Just in case theres another Titans sequel.

(Warner Bros. Entertainment) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday March 29 2012 1250 PM Title Wrath of the Titans Film Info PG-13 Violence. At area theaters. Sometimes when facing a challenge the best thing to do is release a few monsters burrow into the earth and hope for the best. Thats the strategy of ""Wrath of the Titans"" and surprisingly that tactic generally works in its favor. Dont be mistaken this sequel to the 2010 ""Clash of the Titans"" -- itself a remake of a 1981 cheeseball classic -- doesnt transform into anything its sword-and-sandals-style soul cant fill. But it is grubbier and less campy than its predecessor and while that often means men with straggly beards fight in caves for what seems like an eternity it makes the Greek-myth mashup more human. Ten years after the events in ""Clash"" Perseus (Sam Worthington) has turned his back on Mount Olympus. He doesnt care if he is half a god Perseus just wants to be a good single dad and teach his young son Helios how to fish. But everyone in the ancient world is ignoring the gods so Zeus (Liam Neeson) and the rest of the Mount Olympus gang are losing strength. Without prayer they literally turn to stone one of the movies cooler better effects. Zeus pops up in Perseus hut to tell him trouble is brewing Hades (Ralph Fiennes) is causing trouble in the Underworld. Hes joined with Zeus other son the full-on god Ares (Edgar Ramirez) to help Kronos -- the creator of Zeus Hades and Poseidon -- drain Zeus power and destroy the world. Or something like that. So Perseus teams up with Poseidons neer-do-well demigod son Agenor (Toby Kebbell) thinking two half-gods might make a right. Theyre soon joined by the warrior princess Andromeda (Rosamund Pike) to defeat a lot of nasty beasts and put together a magic spear that will send the smoke monster Kronos back to wherever smoke monsters come from. Neeson and Fiennes still act as if this is all Very Serious Business giving stentorian spins to their ridiculous lines. But alas theres less Brit-actor bombast this time round (Bill Nighy is a nice addition as a Monty Python-esque metallurgist to the gods.). Director Jonathan Liebesman keeps ""Wrath"" from being lofty making things down-and-dirty. There could be less crawls through caverns but Liebesmans made a movie about the foot soldiers of Greek mythology and a moderately fun one at that. The biggest fault is that comparatively little attention is given to the monsters. We see a swish of tail here a giant foot there but too often were denied a lingering look at the destroyers. The anti-climactic peak comes when Andromedas army marching off to fight the smoke beast armed only with spears give a cheer when their foe is defeated without their ever doing a thing. The hell with Zeus -- these guys should be the new gods. Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

""Clash"" after all featured such terrible 3D post-production (remember Ralph Fiennes face free-floating an inch in front of his wig?) that it became the standard by which all subsequent awful 3D would be measured. So yes this is a sequel that improves upon the previous movie. But ""Wrath of the Titans"" is still cacophonous visually jumbled and dank and painfully underwritten. Plus they gave Sam Worthington Danny McBrides ""Eastbound and Down"" perm. Worthington returns as half-human half-god Perseus whos now a single dad trying to raise his son in a fishing village far away from sword-fighting and deities. But godliness aint what it used to be -- Perseus papa Zeus (Liam Neeson) shows up to tell his progeny that mortals arent praying so much anymore which is making the gods weaker and that weakness is making it more difficult for the deities of Olympus to keep the underworld as locked down as it once was. Also read Mirror Mirror Review Heigh-Ho Heigh-Ho Its Down the Drain We Go Perseus turns down the chance to go on the road with dad but soon he has no choice after Hades (Fiennes) and Ares (Edgar Ramirez) kill Poseidon (Danny Huston) and imprison Zeus so they can unleash the monstrous Chronos upon the earth. Mankinds last chance is for Perseus to team up with Agenor (Toby Kebbell) half-human son of Poseidon and Queen Andromeda (Rosamund Pike) to combine Zeus thunderbolt Poseidons trident and Hades pitchfork into a megaweapon that will take down Chronos. If this all sounds like a videogame -- go to the place and fight the guy and get the weapon and kill the monster -- rest assured that ""Wrath of the Titans"" is far less compelling than almost anything you can pop into your X-Box these days. Perseus is supposed to be torn between his duties as a demigod and his desire to live as a human but Worthington isnt thespian enough to convey the struggle of choosing Coke over Pepsi. Not that this is a movie designed for good actors mind you; most of the prestige names here are either underutilized (Fiennes Huston Sinead Cusack as one of Perseus fellow villagers) or actively embarrassing. This is one of the few times Neeson has been downright silly in a movie but at least hes got the robes and wigs ready if they ever need him to play Shazam in a Captain Marvel epic. Pike for her part gets to be a ferocious warrior (with dialogue no stupider than that given to her male counterparts) and Bill Nighy puts the whole movie in his pocket in his few scenes as Hephaestus -- he treats the absurd material with the disrespect it deserves. ""Wrath"" has a few moments that pop particularly a forest battle scene involving a giant Cyclops and his vine-and-tree-trunk-based system of traps and overall the film looks brighter than many recent 3D movies. Still theres about one sandstorm too many and director Jonathan Liebesman (""Battle Los Angeles"") shoots the hand-to-hand combat scenes with such herky-jerkiness that its often impossible to tell whos doing what to whom. In the final analysis ""Wrath of the Titans"" is at least somewhat better than anyone might have expected. Which isnt the same as actually being any good at all. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet As a ragingly inessential sequel to a remake of a film based on Greek mythology Wrath Of The Titans is shopworn and derivative even by the degraded standards of contemporary blockbuster filmmaking. 1981s Clash Of The Titans is best remembered as a showcase for the charmingly homemade craftsmanship of stop-motion animation legend Ray Harryhausen who made his swan song one of his best-loved films. The 2010 Clash Of The Titans replaced the painstaking artistry of Harryhausen and his crew with a perfunctory 3-D conversion slapped on the generic CGI of an army of computer programmers. Clash Of The Titans at least boasted an irresistible catchphrase in ""Release the Kraken"" The same cant be said for Wrath Of The Titans which has little to offer beyond slumming heavyweight thespians (Liam Neeson Danny Huston Ralph Fiennes) with silly Methuselah beards that carry most of their phoned-in performances. The eternally adequate Sam Worthington (Avatar Terminator Salvation) plays Perseus the demigod son of alpha-god Zeus (Neeson) and the slayer of the Kraken. As the film opens Perseus has traded in his divine lineage for the life of a humble fisherman but when Zeus is captured by his brother Hades (Fiennes) Perseus springs into action saving him with the help of the neer-do-well son (Toby Kebbell) of Poseidon (Huston) and a warrior queen played by Rosamund Pike. Director Jonathan Liebesman who proved his facility with special effects (and little else) with the surprise hit Battle Los Angeles gives the film a washed-out brown-grey palette and a plodding perversely talky tone. For a film devoted to mindless spectacle the self-serious Wrath doles out action setpieces stingily until the climax which finally delivers a modest dose of dumb fun thats much too little much too late. Liebesmans low-energy low-ambition Wrath Of The Titans never even aspires to be particularly good; it merely aspires to be good enough and fails. Its a tale of gods and monsters that fails to do right by both parties or for that matter an audience it seems to imagine will settle for just about anything.

(AP Photo/Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures) Warner Bros. In this film image released by Warner Bros. Sam worthington portrays Perseus in a scene from ""Wrath of the Titans."" (AP Photo/Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures) And so it was decreed that the defeated army from the kingdom of Hollywood should return to the amphitheater and atone for ""Clash of the Titans.""That pseudo-3-D remake betrayed both the gods of Greece and the titans of technology. Yet the Grecian earn was just enough to justify a sequel. ""Wrath of the Titans"" is considerably better looking than its predecessor but its spewing the same old gibberish.Widowed war-weary Perseus (stoic Sam Worthington) is living as a humble fisherman when he gets a late night visit from his father the god Zeus (Liam Neeson). Because the mortals have stopped praying to the gods Zeus is worried that he will lose his powers and that the hellish Titans led by his own father Kronos will escape from their underworld prison. As a demigod Perseus would rather raise his mortal son than join the battle between god and evil. But when Zeus is taken captive by his jealous brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and resentful son Ares (Edgar Ramirez) Perseus must journey to the center of the Earth to save him.Perseus navigator is neer-do-well demigod Agenor (Toby Kebbel) who uses a map from doddering inventor Hephaestus (Bill Nighy channeling the spirit of ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"").The descent into the labyrinth is the best effect in the movie but the predictable presence of a minotaur is more evidence that the team of scriptwriters merely check-listed every element in a Greek Mythology 101 textbook. The actual story is incoherent and the choppily paced movie is too short to develop the characters. Thats a disservice to serious actors such as Neeson and Fiennes who look embarrassed by their cheap beards and Rosamund Pike whose role as Queen Andromeda is barely explained.Conspicuously absent from the cast is the scene stealer from ""Clash of the Titans."" If ""Wrath of the Titans"" isnt the twilight of the gods the producers of Part 3 may want to rerelease the Kraken.

"Review Wrath of the Titans - Mercury News Hot Topics Big Sur fire Balloon crash No-parachute skydive Deadline 29 to Vegas Sheryl Sandbergs Option B Steve Torrence Ask Amy Comics SV150 Print Email Font ResizeReview Wrath of the TitansBy Randy MyersSan Jose Mercury NewsPosted 03/28/2012 120000 PM PDTUpdated 03/29/2012 023631 AM PDT In Theaters This Week Get showtimes watch movie trailers The Deep Blue Sea Mirror Mirror The Salt of LIfe Wrath of the Titans Wrath of the Titans 3-D Wrath of the Titans Imax Cmon almighty Hollywood. Show us mere mortals some mercy and deliver an honest-to-goodness -- better yet honest-to-badness -- rock em-sock em smackdown of the gods.With the limp and lame ""Wrath of the Titans"" 20th Century Fox commits sins similar to those in the terrible 2010 redo of the 1981 camp classic ""Clash of the Titans.""""Wrath"" again stars Sam Worthington as a demigod hero and his performance here is a slight improvement over ""Clash."" However thats not saying a whole lot.The pluses come on the technical side. Some special effects have improved most notably a fiery climactic battle along with the 3-D which is still superfluous but not as murky and muddled as in the first outing. But good heavens everything else is so homogenized and blah the story the acting the directing the pacing -- you name it.This nonessential sequel brings back conflicted demigod Perseus (Worthington still struggling to carry a film) as a single dad and fisherman who gets sucked back into a hissy fit between squabbling gods.Perseus -- sporting a better do this time -- wishes to stay a member of the 99 percent by sticking to fishing and fatherhood. He gets reeled back into a family feud that could unleash the apocalypse when his village is attacked and Daddy Zeus (Liam Neeson he of the booming voice) is shackled in the Underworld by brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and Ares (Edgar Ramirez) Perseus hot brother.We realize Ares is rotten since the wind machine goes into overdrive blowing his luscious locks around. In fact expect to get so bored that you too will critique hairstyles (by the way Hades is in the most need of a makeover).Advertisement Throw in a band of Cyclops a dopey-looking Minotaur some welcome but all-too-brief comic relief from Bill Nighy as the kooky Hephaestus and Toby Kebbell as the bad boy Agenor along with warrior Queen Andromeda (Rosamund Pike wasted again) and you have a big-budget dud that is a mere tick on the ""Titans"" checklist.Director Jonathan Liebesman (""Battle Los Angeles"") does a fine job with the action sequences but he bungles directing well-heeled actors such as Fiennes and Neeson who bring a certain gravitas to the table yet play their roles as if they were doing Shakespeare. No theyre not. Ramirez so mesmerizing in the miniseries ""Carlos"" shows hints of real evilness but the ho-hum screenplay by Dan Mazeau and David Leslie Johnson handcuffs him never allowing him to tap into his inner villain.""Wrath"" suffers supremely from those kinds of missed opportunities. It takes a CliffsNotes approach to mythology fleecing it of both the drama and the fun. The gods certainly wont be smiling on this one.Wrath of the Titans  1/2Rating PG-13 (for intense sequences of fantasy violence and action)Cast Sam Worthington Liam Neeson Ralph Fiennes Edgar Ramirez Toby Kebbell Rosamund Pike Bill NighyDirector Jonathan LiebesmanRunning time 1 hour 39 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Talend Silicon Valleys latest tech IPO has a strong debutSource Tesla looking at cameras radar in Florida crashCartoons Hillary Clinton makes history Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

Rosamund Pike portrays Andromeda in a scene from ""Wrath of the Titans."" (AP Photo/Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures Jay Maidment) / APShare Photo There arent many pleasures in ""Wrath of the Titans"" the 3-D sequel to the 2010 ""Clash of the Titans"" remake. But surely one is seeing Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson bounding around together as brothers the gods Hades and Zeus. In long beards the two veteran actors are suited to one another like a divine ZZ Top. Camp is a part of the experience here as both ""Titans"" films pull from an unlikely combination of traditions ancient Greece and the 1980s. The clunky ""Clash of the Titans"" remade the 1981 original bringing in boatloads of box office by updating the schmaltzy Laurence Olivier version with contemporary digital effects and a widely decried slapped on conversion to 3-D. ""Wrath of the Titans"" directed by Jonathan Liebesman taking over for Louis Leterrier has modestly improved upon the 3-D this time around and better manages a narrative flow of continuous fantasy action. But thats also all there is A charmless stream of battle and fight sequences that contorts mythic characters into blockbuster conventions. Its comically late - literally the last few minutes - that the film even tries to slide emotion into the characters relations as if attempting to hypnotize us before leaving the theater Oh that was a love story? And that guy - gasp - was supposed to be the funny one? Rather than yet more Kraken releasing (""Release um another Kraken"") ""Wrath of the Titans"" written by Dan Mazeau and David Leslie Johnson charts new ground for the demigod Perseus (Sam Worthington). Going beyond the original ""Clash"" written by Beverley Cross our distance from the original myths grows still more. Perseus is living humbly as a fisherman despite his Kraken-squelching fame. He has sworn off the aging selfish gods such as his father Zeus and uncle Poseidon (Danny Huston). But Hades has made a deal in the underworld dungeon of Tartarus to betray Zeus and siphon his powers to Kronos their dormant father with whom all of hell will follow. Curiously when Kronos like the Kraken before him is finally released he turns out to not be human in appearance like the other gods but a giant swirl of fiery black smoke. Lets call him Smog Man. Father-son issues run everywhere. Conspiring with Hades is Zeus son Ares (Edgar Ramirez playing a more outward villain than his great Carlos the Jackal). Perseus takes up the mantle of world-saver again for the sake of his young boy. Hes joined by Queen Andromeda (the beautiful Rosamund Pike adding grace and levity whenever shes on screen) and a fellow demigod Agenor (Toby Kebbell the presumptive comic relief) son of Poseidon. Their journey into hell involves navigating a few marvels like an enormous Jenga-like underground labyrinth and Bill Nighys gangly magnetism. Nighy plays the aging god Hephaestus from whom the travelers seek a weapon. The brilliant bemused Nighy somehow manages to slur a trademark drawn out ""faaan-tastic"" - a glimpse of comedy in a film (like any film with flying horses) that desperately needs humor. Perhaps Liebesman whose previous movie was the grim ""Battle Los Angeles"" is too drawn to the spectacle of battle to find the balance of camp and seriousness a patently ludicrous film such as ""Wrath of Titans"" seeks. Because if you cant laugh at Smog Man what can you? ""Wrath of the Titans"" a Warner Bros. Pictures release is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of fantasy violence and action.

Wrath of the Titans Fair to good Director Jonathan Liebesman. Cast Sam Worthington Liam Neeson Rosamund Pike. Rating PG-13 for instense fantasy violence and action. Dont take my word for it Sam Worthington who played Perseus in the remake has talked in interviews about ""screwing up"" his role in the movie. The film itself captured none of the goofy charm of the original; it was flat muddled with blurry tacked-on 3-D. If ever there was a movie that did not cry out for a sequel it was ""Clash of the Titans."" Well theres always ""The Godfather Part III"" to one-up that argument. Still ""Wrath of the Titans"" was not exactly what youd call hotly anticipated. And yet either because of those lowered expectations or perhaps because everyone seems to be having a lot more fun this time around ""Wrath of the Titans"" is an improvement. Not a gigantic leap forward for cinema but armed with a new director a new story and the return of a trying-harder Worthington and good ol Liam Neeson as a put-upon Zeus a marked upgrade in quality. The film picks up with Perseus who after saving the world in the first go-round is now a simple fisherman a single father raising his son Helius (John Bell). He rejects his lineage -- his father is Zeus but he wants nothing to do with gods. Neither evidently does anyone else. Humans are turning away from them and when they dont pray we learn the gods lose their power. Which you know who cares? But theres more to it than that. On a visit to Perseus Zeus explains that the world will be undone if man continues to reject the gods. Perseus who defines the term ""reluctant hero"" doesnt much care but even Helius realizes the inevitable; he whittles a wooden dagger in his spare time. Next thing you know Zeus and brother Poseidon (Danny Huston) pay a visit to the underworld and their other brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes) along with another of Zeus sons Ares (Edgar Ramirez). But Ares roughs up Poseidon and he and Hades capture Zeus planning to use him as a sort of energy source to free Cronos the rather abusive father -- he ate his offspring -- whom the three brothers had defeated. The reasons are kind of fuzzy and illogical but whatever The result is that demons and hideous creatures soon are unleashed upon the world and Perseus is finally bestirred to start fighting back. Hell need help from another demigod though so he visits Andromeda (Rosamund Pike) who is busy fighting her own war and has imprisoned Agenor (a goofball Toby Kebbell) Poseidons son. Perseus persuades her to free him and the three set off for an island that is the key to getting into Tartarus where Cronos is imprisoned and Zeus is being sapped of his powers. This entails a visit to Hephaestus (Bill Nighy having a blast) who designed Tartarus and is as it happens a stark raving loon. It all sets up an epic battle for the fate of ... well you know. The world the universe humanity all that. Its a lot to keep up with yes and not all of it holds together. But director Jonathan Liebesman keeps the action moving so that the leaps in logic -- this is on-the-fly mythology after all -- are not as troublesome as they might be. The technical details such as the use of 3-D have been cleaned up and some of the creatures are pretty awesome. Worthingtons Perseus is so ambivalent toward his destiny that it threatens to drag the whole thing down but he comes around eventually and so does ""Wrath of the Titans."" No great shakes but a lot more entertaining than its predecessor. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter twitter.com/goodyk.

""Clash of the Titans"" was a mess full of creaky 3D and plotting howlers but it exhibited a certain charming kid-in-the-sandbox spirit mixing and matching mythologies at will. Two years later the franchise has matured ever so slightly with ""Wrath of the Titans"" hewing incrementally more faithfully to its Greek origins and trimming the fat in essential places. Its a mess too but its far more defensible as a lazy Sunday lark for those who have just recently outgrown action figures. While posing no threat to ""The Hunger Games"" ""Wrath"" should carve a healthy swath through its lesser B.O. competitors. Having vanquished the first films meme-inspiring Kraken muscled demigod Perseus (Sam Worthington) has since retired to a small fishing village to raise his son (John Bell) among mortals while his meddling father Zeus (Liam Neeson) drops by for visits. Meanwhile Greece has slumped into a secular stupor with its temples falling into disrepair and the local gods going unworshipped making them vulnerable to mortality. This gives the embittered Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and his moody young war-god nephew Ares (Edgar Ramirez) an opportunity to usurp Zeus authority which they do by killing off Poseidon (Danny Huston) and confining Zeus to the underworld where they drain his power in order to restore the deposed Titans allowing Hades to release the Kronos. Exactly what this scheming twosome hopes to attain by kickstarting an orgy of deicide is never quite clear but then Greek gods have never been known for their circumspect policymaking. In any case Perseus enlists the help of warrior-queen Andromeda (Rosamund Pike) and fellow demigod Agenor (Toby Kebbell doing a spot-on impersonation of Russell Brand for some reason) to rescue Zeus battling a grab-bag of mythical beasts along the way as well as Ares who appears whenever his name is spoken a la Beetlejuice. Directed by ""Battle Los Angeles"" helmer John Liebesman (taking the reins from ""Clashs"" Louis Leterrier) the film credits two screenwriters which seems excessive as so much of the dialogue simply consists of characters shouting one anothers names with varying degrees of distress or contempt. Even odder theres an additional story collaborator and a character creator never mind that all the films relevant characters have been household names since the time of Hesiod. Yet to the scribes credit the plotting here is ruthlessly streamlined and efficient leaving little room for ponderous sermonizing or leaden comic relief as the pic zips from one ordeal to the next. The lone pause for theological reflection goes something like this ""But gods dont die"" ""They do now."" As he did in ""Clash"" Worthington manages to anchor the film while still being something of a non-presence and Fiennes and Neeson continue to display the rare ability to throw caution to the wind in the service of schlock without sullying their serious-thesp credentials. Ramirez has comparable bonafides but seems far less comfortable chewing the scenery as well as uncertain whether to play the role straight or embrace its inherent silliness. Hes also burdened with the films worst battle scene as well as the seemingly conscious decision to base his characters fighting style on classic lucha libre techniques. In fact all the action setpieces are shot in different styles drawing inspiration from a variety of Saturday morning TV staples. The first in which Perseus takes down a multiheaded beast is thrillingly old-school blessed with surprisingly long shots and well-weighted editing. Things get sketchier and more manic for a fight with the Minotaur; a race through a labyrinth resembles an epic round of Qbert; a mystical weapon-making scene is clearly informed by ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers""; and the climactic battle might well have been assembled from ""Lord of the Rings"" outtakes with Pike wearing Miranda Ottos combat gear. This wild stylistic heterogeneity extends to the tech credits as well. One moment the pic will surprise with a Caravaggio-worthy chiaroscuro composition or an impressively staged shot only to immediately thereafter toss up a volley of cut-and-paste 3D gimmickry. The settings which include such far-flung locales as Wales the Canary Islands and Patagonia look magnificent if notably non-Hellenic which fits the films potpourri of inappropriate accents ranging from English to Australian Venezuelan and French.

Pictures A thin and unimaginative storyline still shouldnt keep the ""Clash of the Titans"" sequel from reaching Olympian box office heights. TWITTER A thin and unimaginative storyline still shouldnt keep the ""Clash of the Titans"" sequel from reaching Olympian box office heights. If the Greeks think things are tough in their country right now Wrath of the Titans can provide ample solace that things were once a whole lot worse. Serving up more action and better visual effects and 3D than the 2010 Clash of the Titans along with a barely-there screenplay that merely functions to notify Perseus which enemy or monster he should hack or skewer next this is a relentlessly mechanical piece of work that will not or cannot take the imaginative leaps to yield even fleeting moments of awe wonder or charm. But the elements as they say are present to produce a sequel that should approach the Olympian box office heights of its predecessor which erupted for more than 493 million worldwide a notable 330 million of which was generated outside the United States. PHOTOS Wrath of the Titans Posters Revealed Greek mythology would amount to little were it not for abundant father-son conflict and this tale features two mighty generations of it. Buried deep and out of sight in particularly unfashionable part of the underworld called Tartarus is Kronos imprisoned there by his sons Zeus Hades and Poseidon (Liam Neeson Ralph Fiennes and Danny Huston all back and bearded for another nice payday). Nothing if not unreliable however Hades has a change of heart and allied with Zeus vicious son Ares (Edgar Ramirez replacing Tamer Hassan in the role) captures Zeus and proceeds to begin transferring the latters considerable powers to their restless dad. Enter Zeus half-human son Perseus (Sam Worthington) who for a decade has been recovering from his battle with the Kraken by modestly working as a fisherman and being an exemplary single dad to son Helius (John Bell). As so many versions of Greek myths and the gods actions existed even in ancient times one cant take issue with the way theyre employed by screenwriters Dan Mazeau in his debut and David Leslie Johnson (Red Riding Hood) and co-story writer Greg Berlanti (Green Lantern) other than to note that the gods here claiming undue neglect by humans behave like petulant mercenaries as anxious to fight as some kid might be to play a video game. PHOTOS Hollywoods A-List Redefined After a mettle-testing battle with the marauding Chimera a notably aggressive flying fiery-mouthed beast with two large heads and snapping snakes head at the end of its tail Perseus sets out to rescue Zeus along with Andromeda (Rosamund Pyke so delectably decked out in a snug-fitting leather outfit as to look like Katniss Everdeens older sister) and Poseidons wayward son Agenor (Toby Kebbell resembling a Russell Brand clone). They in turn are joined by one-time god of craftsmanship Hephaestus (Bill Nighy) who as its designer is the only one capable of negotiating the complex labyrinth leading to the underworld. The amusingly cranky Hephaestus represents a welcome relief from the other uniformly self-serious sojourners but hes unaccountably knocked off almost as soon as he shows up a major blunder by the filmmakers. If youve got Bill Nighy for a gods sake use him; the narrative could easily have accommodated keeping him on the journey for far longer until say Hephaestus might have misremembered some detail of his design leading to a comically resigned demise. Instead things just keep getting heavier. While the relentless Ares tortures his chained father whose arms are slowly consumed by fire Perseus must fight off Cyclops triplets an only glancingly viewed Minotaur and perhaps weirdest of all some wild fighting machines called Makhai which have four weapons-wielding arms and twin twisting bodies atop two legs (and yes Perseus does get to ride Pegasus). VIDEO Wrath of the Titans Debuts New Trailer Featuring Bigger Badder Battles When he finally emerges with the intention of laying the world to waste Kronos could legitimately be considered the original mountain man; formed out of burning rock he towers over all and can set fire to anything in sight with the wave of an arm. Shrewdly designed he cuts arguably a pretty awesome figure and his destruction presents Perseus with a challenge more or less on a par with what Bruce Willis faced in Armageddon. The aftermath strongly suggests that the twilight of the gods has arrived with humans now left to their own devices to make their way in the world without divine intervention. As most of the dialogue is shouted or bellowed its rather beside the point to speak of the performances other than to say that Sam Worthington looked marginally more at home on Pandora than he does in the Greece of myth. Effects work is not only abundant but sharp and some imagination enhances the production design. At the screening caught image brightness was diminished only slightly through the 3D glasses.
