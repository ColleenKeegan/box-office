Stop-Loss is being nervously marketed as a beefcake buddy movie which isnt all that misleading - both of Peirces films to date are fascinated by an American brand of working-class machismo thats as feckless as it is potentially explosive. Here conflicted blue-collar manhood is represented by Sergeant Brandon King (Ryan Phillippe) a chiselled-chinned natural leader and his brothers-in-arms strapping sniper Shriver (Channing Tatum) and puppyish neer-do-well Tommy (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). After a tense tightly constructed Tikrit firefight and some YouTube-style clips of profane aggro-bonhomie among the soldiers the guys return home to small-town Texas where theyre showered with ticker-tape parades and bathe themselves in alcohol. Soon enough Shriver is digging a trench - or is that a grave? - in the front yard Tommy is ploughing his car into inanimate objects and a shocked Brandon is stop-lossed shipped back to Iraq against his will.The rest unfolds as a halting road movie Brandon goes Awol in search of a potentially sympathetic US senator with Shrivers girl Michelle (Abbie Cornish) inexplicably in tow. The film meanders from one melodramatic set piece to another (a cemetery-side throwdown is particularly unfortunate) while the resigned conclusion is disappointing on the level of both politics and drama. Its the film equivalent of a weary shrug - capturing the national mood at a moment when wed all prefer some mood enhancers.

By David Denby Ryan Phillippe in Kimberly Peirces ""Stop-Loss"" a movie that reprises the theme of the hidden wounds of war.   Credit Adrian Tomine ""Stop-Loss"" is the story of a decorated young soldier who returns to Texas with members of his Army unit after fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq watches in anguish as his friends go to pieces and then becomes disgusted and revolts. Stationed in Tikrit at the end of his second tour Staff Sergeant Brandon King (Ryan Phillippe) perhaps twenty-five years old lost some of his men in a combat operation that also killed a few civilians who inadvertently got in the way. Hes torn up inside and by the time he gets home hes had enough. Yet the Army invokes ""stop-loss""--a loophole in his contract which can send him at the command of the President back to Iraq. A natural leader of his men the Sergeant nevertheless bolts for the open road. Directed by Kimberly Peirce (her first feature film since the remarkable 1999 ""Boys Dont Cry"") ""Stop-Loss"" is not a great movie but its forceful effective and alive with the raw mixed-up emotions produced by an endless war--a time when the patriotism of military families is in danger of being exploited beyond endurance. This movie may become the central coming-home-from-the-war story of this period just as ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" made in 1946 became central to the period after the Second World War. Like that extraordinary work ""Stop-Loss"" is devoted to the mens hidden wounds--the wired-up tensions and nightmares that lead to drunkenness fights smashed love affairs and marriages. Throughout the Second World War Hollywood made dozens of patriotic combat films as well as occasional home-front movies (like ""Tender Comrade"" with Ginger Rogers) about gallant wives. The Korean War except for B-movies by Samuel Fuller and Joseph H. Lewis went undramatized until it was over and this was largely true of the Vietnam War too. During all these wars none of the discomforts of the returning soldier or the dismay of his friends and family were shown on the screen. Most of the recent feature films about Iraq (""Rendition"" ""Lions for Lambs"" ""Redaction"") have not been very good and the public has stayed away from them. But audiences ignored Paul Haggiss sternly beautiful and moving ""In the Valley of Elah"" too. Something more than the usual resistance to ""tough"" subjects may be hurting these movies. The Bush Administration told us that we were waging a war for our survival but it also suggested that most of us neednt make sacrifices or even learn much about the conflict. Then again some people may be so angered by the war that they dont want to be confronted by it as entertainment. But Kimberly Peirce whose younger brother has served in Iraq has conceived her picture in popular terms that wont be easy to ignore. Except for a few enraged sentiments that Brandon unloads on his commanding officer ""Stop-Loss"" is not overtly critical of the war but the way it uses the soldiers experience is inherently political. Peirce plays the antiwar game fairly. Indeed she plays it as if she were a soldier herself. She trained for this movie a few years ago obsessed with what her brother was going through she began filming interviews with soldiers and watching the footage that some of them had shot with tiny cameras mounted on their rifles or Humvees. When she heard about men going AWOL after receiving a stop-loss order she had her story. The movie which she developed with the novelist and TV producer Mark Richard is a complicated love letter to American soldiers--and to young American men in general whose minds Peirce has tried in a way to enter before. In ""Boys Dont Cry"" a young woman named Teena Brandon (Hilary Swank) cuts her hair into a butch crew flattens her breasts and puts on boys clothes. Sporting the name Brandon Teena she swaggers into the bars of Falls City Nebraska as a young dude--an utterly mad experiment for which she pays a horrible price. Peirce is still trying to imagine a young mans emotions and she held on to the name Brandon for her new hero. ""Brandon"" or at least this Brandon may represent some essence for her as if all American manhood were poured into a pair of Army fatigues. Brandon King is a strong guy with his head screwed on right and hes not a stiff--his temper flares easily enough. But he doesnt have much humor or individuality. The blond blue-eyed Ryan Phillippe starting with his small role in ""Crash"" has been trying to lose the stud-cherub look of his early screen appearances and he has toughened up. In ""Stop-Loss"" he squares his jaw mostly hides his handsome smile and throws his body into everything as if he felt invulnerable. Phillippe gives an intelligent and physically dynamic performance but hes stuck playing an exemplar who has to carry on his shoulders the weight of all the contradictions facing an American soldier today. He never says anything idiosyncratic or strange; he says only what youd expect him to. Nor does Phillippe do anything as an actor that could be called entirely his. Hes Everyman as rebel. The other soldiers among them Steve (Channing Tatum) who feels comfortable only within the ordering discipline of the Army and Tommy (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who has lost parts of his sanity and his soul in combat are treated by Peirce with both respect and grief. Surely no male director has gone further into the hair-trigger anger and pathos of the American warrior caste. Again and again the men get into brawls--in their heads and in their bodies theyre still in combat mode. Given a heros welcome in a fictional town near Austin they hold back from rejoining the community. Tommy is married and Steve is about to be but they get so drunk and crazy that the women throw them out and they wind up lounging around with each other and with Brandon at a ranch that his parents own. The intimacy that the men share is much stronger than their feelings for women and Tommy in a bitter episode props up his wedding presents on a stump and uses them for target practice. Emotionally this is the most complicated scene Peirce has ever attempted it expresses a profane contempt for domesticity mixed with fear and self-loathing. In a kind of prologue Peirce tells how the men got this way. In Tikrit Brandon and his unit chase a gunman in a car into an alley where snipers are waiting on rooftops. The combat is brief vicious and bloody--a series of jolts and explosions a frightening pursuit into a house--and several Americans are wounded or killed. Even when the picture moves to Texas Peirce keeps us unsettled. The soldiers in ""Stop-Loss"" have made Iraq videos too which are like excruciating experimental films--a rapid flash of terror and ""relaxed"" moments that seem only slightly less frantic than battle. These high-stress episodes which the film jumps back to many times are just an extreme version of the way Peirce and her cinematographer the great Chris Menges (""The Killing Fields"") shoot many of the home-front scenes. As the men squabble and scrap the filmmakers charge into the center of the action with a handheld camera. The staging is often casual and some good lines of dialogue may have got chewed up in the hyperkinetic acting and filming. I like ""Stop-Loss"" best when it calms down--say when Brandon explains to Michele (Abbie Cornish) a tough country woman who is an old friend and also Steves would-be wife why he cant fight anymore and why he cant escape his life in the military either. Peirce loves young men but she also dramatizes how the war takes its toll on the Army mothers and wives and the women anxiously waiting to marry soldiers and this element links ""Stop-Loss"" to earlier films. In ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" three returning vets--a bombardier (Dana Andrews) a sergeant (Fredric March) and a sailor who has lost his hands and has to use hooks (Harold Russell)--meet on their way home to a small city in the Midwest and stay in touch over the next year or so. The movie is one of the high points of psychological realism in Hollywoods studio period. Working with a screenplay by the playwright and F.D.R. speechwriter Robert E. Sherwood the director William Wyler shows us patiently and in depth (literally--the superb Gregg Toland did the deep-focus cinematography) how nothing is quite right for these three at home. Theyve been through tragedy or seen it and they feel contempt for their trivial jobs. The small-city society restricts these men much more than the open spaces of Texas restrict Brandon and his men; theyre hemmed in by whats expected of them--a suit and a tie and decorum. Women are at the center of a genteel social order and they make the veterans--each of whom has trouble with intimacy--miserably uncomfortable. Repeatedly wives and girlfriends (Myrna Loy Teresa Wright and Cathy ODonnell) help their sloshed and sexually indifferent guys get undressed and into bed. The sailor hesitates to marry the girl who has always loved him because its clear to both of them that shes going to have to take the lead in lovemaking. The movie has a sensitivity that at times becomes almost excruciating combined with a horror of breaking down--this was a time when you were supposed to put on a good front no matter how bad your troubles. After some startling disruptions and rearrangements the women coax the men back to sanity and the movie ends with a wedding. All the major characters are present and the restored community closes in harmony around the new couple. Still theres a tinge of uneasiness in the happy ending. Thirty years later in ""Coming Home"" (1978) Jane Fonda comforts Jon Voight a paraplegic vet who in 1968 at the height of the Vietnam War is furiously banging around a military hospital in a wheelchair. She starts an affair with him and leaves her officer husband (Bruce Dern) a hawk whos lousy in bed. ""Coming Home"" shot in gauzy pastels was pretty much a sop to liberals; it caricatured anyone who didnt oppose the war and rewarded the antiwar characters with a sexual adroitness and responsiveness that seemed to emanate from their life-loving impulses. Francis Ford Coppolas forgotten ""Gardens of Stone"" made in 1987 but set in the same period as ""Coming Home"" is much better--a mournful elegy for the dead in Vietnam and a sober acknowledgment of the grit and the honor of military men. Anjelica Huston a leggy antiwar newspaper reporter falls in love with an Army lifer played by James Caan whos sickened by both the war and his own unwillingness to keep fighting it. The movie worked its way through the moral conflicts of 1968 with a bittersweet dignity relieved by halfhearted (and slightly embarrassed) barracks comedy. Its hard to find the right tone for these movies because even in victory there is loss. And the second Iraq war hasnt yielded victory nor is it likely to. For all the shoving and cursing and jangled videos ""Stop-Loss"" has its own kind of tentativeness. Brandon King who is both violent and highly moral (a classic American combination) struggles to understand whats right yet the movie doesnt hold much hope that things are going to work out for him. At this moment and maybe in the future too the resolution of an American warriors doubts is impossible to imagine. The soldiers are held together by their love for one another and that element of Army life may make ""Stop-Loss"" popular with both liberals and conservatives but no one I think will be happy about what the movie suggests is happening to some of the best young people in the country.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Lip Service ShareThis Ryan Phillippe in Stop-Loss.  (Photo Courtesy of Paramount Pictures) On the surface Kimberly Peirces Stop-Loss doesnt bear much resemblance to her momentous debut Boys Dont Cry the story of a young woman (Hilary Swank) who pretendedjoyfullyto be a good ol boy and got raped and murdered when her dumbfounded drinking buddies couldnt process their little chums new identity. But something ties the two films together. For a Feminist Studies type Peirce has an uncanny knack for getting inside the heads of young men for making you feel how powerfully their identities are bound up in their masculine relationships and rituals. Stop-Loss doesnt come together but in its ungainly way it evokes the anguish of American shit-kickers whove lost all sense of autonomy. BACKSTORY After Reese Witherspoon cited irreconcilable differences when filing for divorce from Ryan Phillippe the rumor mill pointed to his Stop-Loss co-star Abbie Cornish as the other woman. With the movies release the old tabloid story is reborn. Phillippe says its unfair to direct blame at Cornish I dont think an outside person can ever cause a divorce He told W. I had difficulties in my marriage long before I ever met her. And anyway he described his relationship with Cornish as merely a friendship in a really difficult situation. Witherspoon is now dating Jake Gyllenhaal. No hard feelings from Ryan As he told Howard Stern Hes a good dude. Ryan Phillippe in Stop-Loss. The movie centers on three Texas soldiers (Ryan Phillippe Channing Tatum and Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who return from Iraq after an ambush that left some of their friends dead and maimed and another barely suppressing his inadvertent killing of civilians. That battle is the opening sequence and Peirce makes you understand on a gut level the adrenaline-fueled hyperawareness of these men at a checkpoint as they almost fire on a car with a family speeding toward them then the unreality of the moment when insurgents in another speeding car open fire on them. When its all over and the Americans roll into Texas on a bus ready to be discharged you get a palpable sense of how wound up they areitching to get drunk and laid and court oblivion. They barely make it through the parade and speech of a U.S. senator before theyre throwing back shots and retching and punching people out and having the requisite war flashbacks. The films title refers to the presidential prerogative of extending a service members enlistment contract beyond its expiration date in times of wara backdoor draft that according to the movies postscript has kept 81000 Americans and counting in uniform. The most stable of the three protagonists Brandon (Phillippe) learns he has been stop-lossed when he goes back to base to get his discharge papers and although he comes from a military family and has no evident problems with the war he refuses on the spotthen punches out two guards and goes AWOL. Phillippe has never struck me as much more than a pretty face but his underplaying works here. He doesnt transform into a grandstanding actor; he looks completely at sea. When his pal Steves fiancee Michelle (Abbie Cornish) volunteers to drive him to Washington D.C. to get help from a senator who promised him the world Stop-Loss becomes a road moviean odyssey that leads the pair to the family of a lost friend a fleabag motel where another AWOL stop-loss casualty hides out with his wife and sick kid and a hospital where Brandons squad mate Rico (Victor Rasuk) lies blind and severely maimed. Its ironic that Stop-Loss loses its momentum when the characters go on the road. Yet Rasukthe star of Raising Victor Vargasgives a stunning performance He plays Rico as upbeat almost content knowing that Iraq was payback for 9/11 and determinedly building up his one remaining bicep. And by rights this part of the film should crawl along and go essentially nowhere. Brandon whose life is bound up in his role as a soldier has no real recourse; and Peirce and her co-writer Mark Richard have no answers. The power of Stop-Lossand this is no dumb jokeis that it shows its hero between Iraq and a hard place. In The Flight of the Red Balloon the great Taiwanese filmmaker Hou Hsiao Hsien uses Albert Lamorisses 1956 masterpiece The Red Balloon as a springboard for his own masterpiecea distinctively modern and allusive one yet so tender and plaintive that you understand what Hou is up to on a preconscious level. Lamorisses balloon now floats above Simon (Simon Iteanu) a 7-year-old Paris boy whose single mother Suzanne (Juliette Binoche) can barely keep her life together and whose new nanny Song (Song Fang) is a quiet attentive film student who thinks about making her own version of The Red Balloon. The film is built on contrasts on invisible currents and crosscurrents. There is the steadiness of Hous camera and the chaos of Suzannes world with its implicit toll on the psyche of her little boy lost amid the clatter. Suzanne writes puppet shows in which her mythical characters are transfigured yet her life is miserably untranscendent. She sits amid piles of paper her peroxided hair clenched wailing into her phone high-strung and bereft. Binoche improvised her lines fumbling her way along like Suzanne and the tension between her myopia and Hous higher gaze gives the film its center its meaning. The Flight of the Red Balloon is full of allusions to filmmaking even to the art of making a balloon pulled around by a person look as though its floating free. That balloon stands in for Hou and Song; at times it has the impishness of a Miyazaki god. It watches over this neglected child helpless to intervene. Yet its beneficenceand the art that gave birth to itmakes you look to the sky and hope. Shine a Light Directed by Martin Scorsese Paramount Classics. PG-13.

Its so gripping a sequence so harrowing so immediate that what follows -- a heavy-handed morass -- is all the more a letdown. Haunted by the firefight one that left several members of his unit dead and several critically injured now wracked with guilt about the men he couldnt save staff sergeant Brandon King (a diligent Ryan Phillippe) focuses on one thing getting back to his familys Texas ranch and getting back to life as a civilian with his childhood best friend and comrade-in-arms Steve (Channing Tatum). But after the welcome-home parade and the awarding of medals the much-decorated Brandon learns hes isnt being discharged after all. Rather hes being sent back to Iraq thanks to a policy -- Stop-Loss -- that lets the military redeploy soldiers even after theyve completed their service. ENLARGE Brandons troubles and the movies troubles begin more or less simultaneously -- when the sergeant decides that hell no he wont go. Instead hell go AWOL -- a tough plot turn to swallow considering his stalwart sense of duty and almost saintly nature -- and request intervention from his senator in D.C. Lots of luck. Steves pretty fiancee Michele (Abbie Cornish) comes along on the quixotic contrived road trip which has more detours than a Michelin guide. There are visits to the parents of a fallen soldier from Brandons unit; to a burned blinded amputee buddy at a military hospital; and a lawyer in New York to learn about assuming a new identity and moving to Canada -- all punctuated by flashbacks to the carnage that is daily life in Iraq. Its an awful lot of stops for a fellow whos got the police on his tail. In fact the journey makes about as much sense as the rest of ""Stop-Loss"" which is swamped by cliches continuity problems stock characters and very good intentions. Hors de Prix (Priceless) Certain Americans in Paris getting their first bite of a baguette vow to replicate the signature French bread in their kitchens back home. Flour? Check. Yeast? Check. Pinch of salt? Yup. But the loaf never matches up to the one at the boulangerie. Must be something with the water. Hollywood filmmakers watch a particular sort of French romp -- ""Cousin Cousine"" and ""Trois Hommes et un Couffin"" spring immediately to mind -- and plan a remake in English. (Watch this space for the Americanization of ""Priceless."" ) But the U.S.-made product never quite matches the flavor of the original. Must be something with the water. ENLARGE Audrey Tautou in Hors de Prix (Priceless) In this case its the water of the Cote dAzur the setting for the enchanting ""Priceless"" which calls to mind Lubitschs ""Trouble in Paradise"" and beguiles all the way from the parade of umbrellas decorating the opening titles to the closing credits. Irene (the delectable Audrey Tautou) a gold-digger of no mean skills has all but bagged a free-spending middle-aged geezer. The deal becomes no deal when Irene mistakes a shy unprepossessing hotel factotum Jean (Gad Elmaleh) for a millionaire. When she learns the truth Irene swiftly and spitefully works her way through Jeans meager bank account in one instance ordering caviar though she loathes the stuff then abandons the poor love-struck sap. The two meet again when Irene has snared another deep-pocketed gent at a tony hotel and Jean reaping the benefits of another misapprehension is in residence as the boy toy of a well-fixed and well-preserved widow. Hilariously gigolette begins giving gigolo tutorials in the most effective ways of scoring swag like motor bikes and jewel-encrusted watches. These methods include seductive glances sulks (civilizations were built on less than Ms. Tautous pout) and halting half-finished sentences. Tawdry? Not for a minute. Credit a subtle and souffle-light script. The services rendered by Irene and Jean are implied rather than observed. Admittedly however the foreplay -- in the form of shopping montages -- is as explicit as can be Strappy Chanel heels are fondled as theyre being swaddled in tissue paper; price tags are snapped off dresses and pocketbooks with more enthusiasm than button-popping in the boudoir. 21 At their best movies set in the choice precincts of Las Vegas -- the roulette wheel the slot machines and the blackjack table -- give viewers a vicarious kick. Eagerly they wait for the answer to the eternal question Will the hero hit the jackpot or hit the skids? Then there is the Las Vegas-centered ""21"" which regrettably is far more ""Oliver"" than ""Oceans 11"" with Kevin Spacey as a mash-up of Fagin and Bill Sykes. Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) is an intellectually gifted socially awkward senior at M.I.T. with only one thing standing between him and Harvard medical school the 300000 tuition fee. The 8 per hour Ben makes as assistant manager of a mens clothier would barely cover the cost of a lab coat and though hes applied for a prestigious scholarship the competition is fierce. The qualifying interviews for the grant serve as ""21""s framing device. Bens anorexic bank account makes him easy picking for math professor Micky Rosa (Mr. Spacey) who when he isnt teaching statistics is recruiting the best and the brightest students teaching them how to count cards (a technique that the movie never succeeds in explaining clearly) then setting them loose to shake up and shake down the Vegas blackjack tables. Though initially hesitant Ben is won over by the lure of easy money and the allure of a beautiful teammate (Kate Bosworth whos both too old and too model-pretty for the part). The script is adapted from the bestselling ""Bringing Down the House."" But rather than go the way of its source material a saga of canny undergrads triumphantly sticking it to the man the makers of ""21"" chose the cautionary-tale approach. The result is a none-too-winning blend of the unsettling -- college kids themselves barely 21 caught in the crosshairs of a thuggish casino security chief (Laurence Fishburne) -- and the unsurprising. Ben comes equipped with the requisite geeky friends and travels a well-worn cinematic path from sin to redemption. Very little adds up in ""21."" Why considering the risks of the enterprise would Micky and minions not spread their trade around -- go to Atlantic City Foxwoods Mohegan Sun every once in a while rather than returning weekend after weekend to Vegas? If the professor (a former professor in ""Bringing Down the House"") has done so well moonlighting why does he continue to teach? Does this guy actually have tenure? DVD TIP In William Wylers beautifully handled multi-Oscar winner ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" (1947) three soldiers -- played by Fredric March Dana Andrews and Harold Russell -- return home from World War II to wildly divergent welcomes.

Its an uneven experience with some evocative moments and others that dont resonate as much as they should. TRAILER War is dramatic Not unlike last years film Rendition Stop-Loss seeks to bring into focus a government practice of retaining soldiers beyond their expected term exploiting a loophole in service contracts that prevents them from retiring from duty when their term is complete. Stop-Loss features strong performances by Ryan Phillippe Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Victor Rasuk. The film follows Phillippe and his buddies during a key battle in Iraq and upon their re-entry to their Texas hometown. (Rated R for graphic violence and pervasive language.

Brandon King (Ryan Phillippe) in the gripping but somewhat limited Stop-Loss.   (PHOTO SUPPLIED)  By Philip MarchandMoviesFri. March 28 2008Starring Ryan Phillippe Channing Tatum Victor Rasuk and Abbie Cornish. Directed by Kimberly Peirce. 112 minutes. At major theatres. 14A Of the two opening scenes in Stop-Loss its hard to tell which is the scarier - the scene in which a handful of American soldiers fight it out with insurgents in the back alleys of an Iraqi city or the scene in which they return to their hometown in Texas.""Two things you will not do while youre on leave"" a commanding officer barks at his men as their bus pulls into town. ""You will not drink and drive. You pick up a young lady let her drive. Do not beat up civilians. You will not f--- anyone underage. You will not beat your wife. You will not beat your kids.""Thats more than a couple of prohibitions of course but whos counting after two? The point is that life in the military often feels like a combat boot in the shins. Kimberly Peirces film is at its best when she conveys this raw acrid flavour of army life particularly as it affects her hero Sgt. Brandon King (Ryan Phillippe). The day the bus pulls into town is a happy one for him. He is about to be discharged having completed his tour of duty and acquitted himself admirably in situations like that firefight where he led his men into an alley full of ambushers.Article Continued BelowA rude surprise awaits him however when he shows up the next day to say goodbye to the U.S. Army. They want him back in Iraq for another tour of duty. King practically goes berserk at the news but in vain. Its called ""stop-loss"" a procedure whereby the army compels soldiers to remain in service even past their date of discharge. Not enough new recruits are available for George W. Bushs ""surge"" in Iraq so veterans must be shanghaied. King is prepared to desert so bad is the prospect of chasing insurgents down more alleys.""Canadas not that bad"" a friend reassures him.But the men under his command also due to return to Iraq exert moral pressure. Steve Shriver (Channing Tatum) is the toughest of the lot - his nickname is ""robo-soldier.""When a hometown civilian asks ""Hey Steve we winning this one?"" he replies ""If I had to do it again Id be a f------ sniper. One shot one kill. Let me be the `faceless enemy."" Bitter though he may be about the fortunes of war he represents a lot of men who prefer fighting to civilian life. ""You really see me selling cars?"" he asks King.Similar sentiments are voiced by another soldier whose method of adjusting to civilian life is to drink himself silly and smash windows. ""All I want to be is a soldier"" he says. ""The armys my family. I know Im a little sideways but give me one more chance please"" he begs the army after getting into a scrape while on leave. Both soldiers have bonded with King and wouldnt want to dodge bullets with anyone else.The speech gestures and attitudes of the men in Stop-Loss have the ring of authenticity. If nothing else the makers of this movie have immersed themselves in military life and probably have a real-life warrant for every line of dialogue spoken in the movie. We can believe there are soldiers who think and behave like this.Still were not drawn to them and we dont really care what happens to them - even when their faces loom over us in close-up which frequently happens. As characters they seem to exist simply to dramatize an issue the injustice of ""stop-loss."" Theres no sex in the movie for example and no romance just the tense relations of men who are always on the edge of either violence or fear or the tearful emotions of masculine camaraderie. The movie is a gripping but very limited view of their lives.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME Not to put too fine a point on it Stop-Loss is a movie about getting screwed. By your own government no less -- which you have served loyally and bravely. It works this way You enlist in the army for a given term of years. Then when it is time for your discharge an obscure clause in your contract (which gives the military the right to compel additional services) is invoked and back you go to the hell of Iraq. You have no right of appeal no legal recourse. According to the press notes for Kimberly Peirces powerful film some 81000 young men and women have been ""stop-lossed"" since the U.S. invaded Iraq five years ago with untold numbers of them choosing to go AWOL living underground or in exile but perpetually on the run rather than accept injustice. This is Peirces first film since Boys Dont Cry and it is in part inspired by the fact that her own brother fired by patriotic fervor in the aftermath of 9/11 enlisted and served in Iraq. As youll remember from the earlier picture Peirce has a special tough-minded empathy for the American underclass those among us who live in poverty and powerlessness and are essentially fodder for those higher and mightier American Dreamers who have the power to determine their destinies. Such a figure is Brandon King (Ryan Phillippe) who has bravely served his time -- the picture opens with a very well staged combat sequence -- in Iraq and yearns now for the tranquility of life in his one-horse Texas home town. Ordered to re-up he deserts despite the fact that his best pal (Channing Tatum) is determined to return him to duty. Brandon chastely accompanied by Michelle (Abbie Cornish) embarks on a cross-country trip which begins with him seeking official redress of his grievance and eventually puts him in touch with other victims of the war. In the end it is fair to say that there is no stopping his losses. Every choice he is presented with is a hopeless one. There is no blinking the fact that Stop-Loss is a relentlessly grim film. Every movie so far made about the war in Iraq -- both fictional and documentary -- has failed at the box office and there is no reason to suppose that this ones fate will be any different. It is not just that we dont want to confront the costs and consequences of that conflict when we are out for a good time at the movies. It is also that we dont want to acknowledge that this war has largely been fought by a victim class whose motives for joining the military are rarely noble or exemplary. These are people for whom the military -- with its enlistment bonuses its promises of health educational and even travel benefits -- represents their best chance to escape a minimum-wage life. It is a measure of their desperation that they are willing to risk their lives to claim these boons. It is a measure of their dutifulness that they often evoke a certain patriotism to rationalize their choice. There is nothing ignoble about this deal and there is nothing ignoble when they realize that their idealism cannot sustain the sacrifices they are called upon to make. What is ignoble is the failure of the military to live up to its end of the bargain and the way the institution exploits their good faith and their innocent belief in a system that does not believe in them. As a nation we owe them more than they owe us -- as this painfully necessary and heartfelt movie makes abundantly clear.

Directed by Kimberly Peirce. (R. 112 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) The militarys ""stop-loss"" policy allows the U.S. government to keep calling back soldiers for multiple tours of duty in Iraq. The human consequences of this policy are explored in ""Stop-Loss"" the latest from Kimberly Peirce who is best known for directing (and co-writing) ""Boys Dont Cry."" Obviously with a title like ""Stop-Loss"" its no surprise that this is a movie about a soldier who gets stop-lossed. But a lot happens between the opening credits and the soldiers order to report back to duty. In that long interval the film establishes its attention to atmosphere and its respect for the Army its culture and the kinds of communities from which soldiers spring. Clearly Peirces motives are pure. Shes not using the ""stop-loss"" issue as a wedge to make the government or the administration look bad. Shes using it to dramatize an injustice and to advocate on behalf of the soldiers. And so she begins where she should begin in Iraq on a seemingly routine day at a checkpoint. Then something happens and in the blink of an eye these young men find themselves in a narrow alley with machine gun fire and rockets raining down on them from the rooftops. Its harrowing men are killed and another soldier is blinded and crippled. We realize that every day this could happen and that on some days it does happen so its understandable that every soldier in Iraq ends up counting the days until his duty is done and he gets to go home alive and in one piece. As in ""Boys Dont Cry"" Peirce who wrote the screenplay for ""Stop-Loss"" has a feel for small-town life for the things rowdy young people say and for how they act when drunk. Prior to their discharge the men go back to their Texas town and enjoy a weekend pass. They hook up with friends relatives and girlfriends they havent seen in months and drink and carry on all night. In these scenes Peirce does a number of important things - and she does them all at the same time. She establishes the nature of the town acknowledging both the expansiveness of its spirit and the narrowness of its worldview. She also gives us a feel for what these fellows are like when they relax. These are young testosterone-driven fellows who like to get drunk and shoot guns. This is what they were like before they joined the Army. It might be why they joined the Army in the first place. And yet - Peirce does this subtly but unmistakably - she lets us know that the behavior were seeing is beyond the usual Texas partying that the things these fellows are doing on their first night back indicate young men in the grip of post-traumatic stress disorder. They cant stop. Theyre jumpy. Their moods are on a hair trigger. Under the best of circumstances its going to be a long road back. These guys have already paid their dues. And once we see that - not just know it but feel it - Peirce has set up her story. She has taken us to the point that its just unthinkable that these men should ever have to go through this again. In a way thats the real beginning of the film. Before that is the prologue. Ryan Phillippe as the young sergeant who gets stop-lossed embodies a special sort of young man who is very much Army material - aggressive enthusiastic and patriotic. Yet hes too smart not to know when hes being had and too conscience-driven not to regret some of the things the Army has made him do. His superior intelligence and perception put him into conflict for the first time with his best friend (Channing Tatum) whose emotional structure makes him incapable of questioning authority. Its a nice performance from Tatum as a guy who thinks hes trying to understand but who unconsciously knows he cant afford to. Finally there may be a star-making performance in ""Stop-Loss"" that of Abbie Cornish as our heros childhood friend. As Michelle shes blond pretty and tough as hell. She drives a big old American car. She can down four Tequila shots in a row.

Her newest film which she cowrote and directed might well carry the same title. It is about boys fierce and fervent who have enlisted to fight in Iraq. They dont cry. They joke rage seethe shoot sustain injury and complete tours of duty - only to be redeployed again. Stop-Loss Peirces vital portrait of soldiers snared by the Army loophole that sends them back to Iraq has the rhythms and imagery of a generation-defining film. While it would be premature to decorate it as the Best Years of Our Lives or Coming Home of the Surge Stop-Loss carries the emotional force and propulsive drama of the quintessential soldiers story. Admittedly the opening sequences of this MTV-produced film look like The Real World Karbala. Co-opting the style of soldier-shot footage captured on digicams cellphones and Palm Pilots the early scenes of Stop-Loss are unpromising and inauthentic as a Parisian popster who tries to imitate Elvis. Yet Peirce makes it work. Her DIY digital diary of a grunts life-and-death encounters at military checkpoints and in the crossfire of an urban raid introduces the audience to her principal characters in action. Theres Sgt. Brandon King (Ryan Phillippe) the unifier squad leader of the boys from Brazos Texas effectively the films superego. Theres Sgt. Steve Shriver (Channing Tatum) sharpshooter its id. Barely surviving an ambush with them are Tommy (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) the baby-faced newlywed and Rico (Victor Rasuk) who loses his limbs to a guerrillas grenade that claims other squad members. Like Chris Menges low-key and lucid cinematography Peirces direction of her actors is intimately scaled and matter-of-fact. No bid to make a sentimental story or sweeping war allegory. Just a document of the struggles of those fighting the external war in Iraq (or war at home) while battling inner demons. All the performances are quiet and pitch-perfect Phillippe Tatum and Abbie Cornish (as Michelle Steves fiancee and Brandons friend) the best of the best in conveying moral pain and outrage. As Peirce frames it separation and war have crossed and shorted their internal wiring. Sparks fly. Arriving home in Brazos after their tour of duty Brandon grows misty when he sees the onion fields of home. Hes happy to be back unlike Steve and Tommy. Without the daily structure of discipline and armed confrontation they grow restive. They dont know what to do with their adrenaline surges. This leads to a black-comic sequence involving an inventive way to open wedding presents and other more tragic outcomes. Thus when Brandon and Steve go to the base to exchange their gear for separation papers they learn that theyve been stop-lossed. Their different responses - anguish and thoughts of going AWOL for war-hero Brandon and orders-following relief for Steve - occupies the films second half. In this politicized country during this polarizing war in an election year Stop-Loss will generate debate about its political point of view. Without pulling any punches the film is pro-soldier anti-bureaucrat war-neutral and deeply deeply affecting.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Stop-Loss. (R) Paramount (112 min.) Directed by Kimberly Peirce. With Ryan Phillippe Joseph Gordon-Levitt Channing Tatum. Opens Friday at theaters in New Jersey. THREE STARS Just because a movie should be seen doesnt mean it will be. ""Stop-Loss"" is a long-awaited film from a gifted young director. It features great photography a handsome young cast -- including Ryan Phillippe and indie-it boy Joseph Gordon-Levitt -- and a topical and important subject. Unfortunately that subject is the Iraq war -- unpopular in American movie houses these days. That was proven last year as more than half-a-dozen war-on-terror films finally hit theaters -- and sank one after another. Some were great (""In the Valley of Elah"") some were risky (""Redacted"") some were safe (""Rendition"") and some were awful (""Lions for Lambs."") And each met with the same yawns. ""Stop-Loss"" therefore arrives as a hard sell. It also however happens to be a good movie -- and a different one. Directed and co-written by ""Boys Dont Cry"" director Kimberly Peirce -- whose own kid brother is a vet of Afghanistan and Iraq -- it doesnt really question the war or our warriors. What it assails is a policy that wont let them come home. Sgt. Brandon King it seems has served in the Army in Iraq with distinction and is happy to get back to his Texas ranch. But theres a new Catch-22 -- hes served with such distinction the Army doesnt want to let him go. So it invokes its ""stop-loss"" policy re-enlisting him against his will and telling him to get on the next transport plane back. And for once Sgt. King doesnt feel like following orders. King is played by Phillippe and its a huge step forward for him. Blessed (or cursed) with pretty-boy looks he first got attention for marrying Reese Witherspoon then for splitting from her (shortly after he was linked to his co-star in this picture Abbie Cornish). Yet his recent roles (""Breach"" ""Crash"" ""Flags of Our Fathers"") have shown a new maturity and his performance here has a sharp edge. Hes well supported by the actors playing his two best buddies Channing Tatum -- who has a nice if slightly brutish physicality -- and Gordon-Levitt who has a sly secretive gaze. (Less striking is Cornish whos been hailed as the next big thing to come out of Australia but is all tiny features and sullen mouth -- provenance aside she shares neither Nicole Kidmans icy control nor Naomi Watts tremulous vulnerability). The script also falters a bit setting King off on a desperate but ridiculously improbable road trip as he goes AWOL so he can drive to Washington D.C. and personally appeal to a Texas Senator. (What he couldnt pick up a phone?) Yet there are still many more good and confident choices here particularly in the direction and the way it integrates the soldiers own war movies. Especially good is the way Peirce captures these vets bloody bonds of camaraderie -- also their awkward alienation from the folks who stayed behind. One home-coming scene dramatizes it quickly as the soldiers talk coldly sometimes brutally about what theyve seen. Their girlfriends and parents look on in silent disapproval and eventually horror -- these arent the boys that they sent over there. Which of course is the movies point. The men and women who are coming back from tours of duty arent the same men and women who began them. Theyve seen too much done too much lost too much not to have changed. But ""Stop-Loss"" argues whatever we think about the war they fought the fact is that they fought it. They did their duty. And now its time to do ours. Rating note The film contains bloody violence alcohol abuse and strong language. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

""Stop-Loss"" is a highly patriotic film if you happen to dream of the restored caliphate as you sleep in your Osama bin Laden pajamas. Its message is that the good guys are US soldiers who decide to desert such as a sergeant played by Ryan Phillippe. (Another soldier played by Channing Tatum of ""Step Up"" is the villain He wants to re-enlist.) Sgt. Brandon King (Phillippe) returns home to Texas to be pinned with a medal for noble service in Iraq where he led his men into a lethal situation any member of the Salvation Army would have immediately recognized as an ambush. He and the other actors compete to out-crazy each other while yokelizing their accents a couple of notches past ""Texan"" to ""stroke victim."" Every sentence must contain the word ""aint"" and everybody spends their time killin rattlers when theyre not relaxing in the ""Little House on the Prairie"" shacks they call home. Tatums character Shriver digs himself a foxhole in the front yard and starts howling about enemies in the night while Tommy (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) drives into a lamppost and shoots his wedding presents with a rifle. Then Sgt. King who is supposed to be discharged learns that he has been hit with a stop-loss order requiring him to re-report for duty. The Army stop-loss program is disturbing but its also an unfortunate necessity when there is neither a draft nor a volunteer spirit; it wasnt needed in say the Korean War. Tough as it is to take a soldier cant do much about it and the military would fall apart if it didnt punish runaways. The mention of the stop-loss policy is the last time the movie intersects with reality. From then on its strictly comedy or maybe sci-fi. Sgt. King gets to march into the office of a lieutenant colonel (Timothy Olyphant) jumping over the intervening seven ranks to announce ""With all due respect f - - - the president."" Sure. About to be brought to the stockade Sgt. King simply punches out a couple of minders and runs. Getting away with this in the middle of a military base in daylight is about as likely as escaping from a submarine but never mind its on to the next howler. Brandon tells his parents about his refusal to report but they neglect to beat him with the nearest mop handle and instead cheer him on. Desert away my boy And for no discernible reason his best friends girl (Abbie Cornish) jumps in a car with him. Brandon plans to ask a senator he once shook hands with for help as soon as they can drive to Washington. Because there aint no phones in Texas. As we cut from Texas to their road trip (the two of them are constantly driving over bridges) Brandon continues to wear his fatigues despite being on the run from MPs. He even walks into a military hospital where the movie proves it thinks sergeants are addressed as ""Sir."" The Timberlakish Phillippe does his best to play things wacky/flashbacky ""First Blood""-style with three street toughs who bust up his car. ""OK Hadjis"" he cries. ""Yall better start prayin to Allah"" He also dives into a swimming pool imagining a buddy is lying on the bottom. More than an hour goes by before he realizes senators dont actually help deserters (at least until Sen. Al Franken is sworn in). In the alternate reality of ""Stop-Loss"" desertion a crime punished by most armies through most of history with a firing squad is handled about the same way as staying out after dark to play kick the can even though your mama done told you to be back in time for supper. But never mind all that because in the closing moments the film reverses course on everything it supposedly stands for except absurdity. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next LINDSAY LOHAN GETS FIRST FILM ROLE SINCE REHAB Read Next LINDSAY LOHAN GETS FIRST FILM ROLE SINCE REHAB Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 16888 How Hillary blew her big moment 9924 Malia Obama skipped the DNC for Lollapalooza 7062 NYC tourist duped into buying 1M worth of fake jewelry Now On Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary Jill and Joe Biden stop traffic on Fifth Avenue SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Ryan Phillippe Abbie Cornish and Channing Tatum Elizabeth Weitzman Wednesday June 4 2008 351 PM Stop-Loss. A troubled young veteran returns home from Iraq only to be ordered back. With Ryan Phillippe Abbie Cornish. Director Kimberly Peirce (153). R Graphic violence language. At area theaters.Despite several attempts were still waiting for the drama that convincingly captures the experience of soldiers whove fought in Iraq. ""Stop-Loss"" isnt that film but at the very least its efforts are honorable.The movie is squarely aimed at a young audience which is both an asset and an obstacle. Few soldiers look like the beautiful cast members who stock this slick film but many moviegoers will be able to relate to them. Director Kimberly Peirce also co-wrote the script which begins by dropping us in Tikrit. Staff Sgt. Brandon King (Ryan Phillippe) is determined to keep his men sane but as we can see from one deadly struggle its all he can do to keep them alive. When he and his surviving troops finish their tour and head home to Texas they hope to return to ordinary life immediately. Its soon clear however that ""ordinary"" is no longer an option. Hothead Tommy (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) cant seem to steady himself without the constant distraction of machine-gun fire. Steve (Channing Tatum) takes his unrelenting anger out on his fiancee Michelle (Abbie Cornish). And Brandon is stunned to be called back to duty under President Bushs reinstated stop-loss policy. A devout patriot Brandon nevertheless refuses to return to Iraq. He considers this ""back-door draft"" the ultimate betrayal from the country he has faithfully served. Unfortunately the Army sees it differently. Either he goes back or he goes AWOL. For her long-overdue followup to ""Boys Dont Cry"" Peirce chose a deeply personal subject Her teenage brother fought in Iraq. Her frustration and concern are evident and they give the movie an empathy that counteracts the overly polished packaging and two-dimensional storytelling. It also helps that she has a strong cast. We can see within minutes where these characters are heading but the actors do a nice job getting us there. Peirce may actually be too close to the issues since so many scenes feel like setups for political speechifying. But viewers of any age are bound to be moved by her primary theme that there is no easy cure for these damaged young veterans whether they return to war or fight their demons at home. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

The movie creates its characters with love and detail.  |  1/2 out of 4 stars By Colin Covert Star Tribune March 29 2008 -- 102pm AP Photo / Frank Masi Paramount Pictures and MTV Films Channing Tatum and Ryan Phillippe in ""Stop-Loss"" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint With its dual focus on war in Iraq and conflict in American soldiers hometowns ""Stop-Loss"" may be the most morally complicated film about warfare and its aftermath since ""The Deer Hunter."" The film follows a close-knit group of servicemen from chaotic violence in an urban battlefield to the languid rhythms of rural Texas. Yet the tension scarcely slackens merely burrowing deeper and threatening to erupt. In the film young Sgt. Brandon King (Ryan Philippe) in his second tour of duty leads his men into an ambush firefight against snipers in an Iraqi housing complex. The harrowing skirmish that follows leaves several of his men dead or gravely wounded and a high toll of civilians alongside the enemy gunmen. Brandon is a patriot and a conscientious leader but he struggles with his feelings toward duty and combat and a case of survivors guilt. With his brother-in-arms and best friend Steve Shriver (beefy Channing Tatum) hes chagrined to receive a heros welcome-home parade in little Brazos. The cheering crowds visions of glory are a far cry from the grunts-eye-view that Brandon and his men have shared. Steve too has trouble leaving the war behind digging a foxhole in his yard behavior that understandably troubles his fiancee Michelle (Abbie Cornish). Another returned soldier Tommy Burgess (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) unable to disengage his warrior mind-set after his service is descending into alcoholic brawling using the unopened wedding gifts he and his wife received for target practice. Brandon snaps when hes snagged by the stop-loss policy which the military invokes to retain soldiers beyond their expected term. Told he must return to Iraq for a third tour he deserts the Army base and decides to run for Canada. Steve is dismayed by his decision and by Michelles decision to help him. The story steers away from cliches and political polemics maintaining a tone of unflinching emotional realism. The movie creates its characters with love and detail. Brandon a genuine patriot stressed beyond his limits wants simple justice a concept he and his superior officers define differently. STOP-LOSS  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for graphic language and pervasive violence. Cinematographer Chris Menges (""The Killing Fields"") and editor Claire Simpson (""Platoon"") give the film a rough-edged beauty and irresistible momentum. Kimberly Peirce a strong actors director gets terrific performances out of her supporting cast. The wonderful Irish actor Ciaran Hinds cast as Brandons father probably doesnt speak 20 words but Peirce finds every complicated emotion she needs in his interesting baggy face. She draws distinctively different colors from every member of her ensemble though they all suffer the common problem of readjusting to civilian life. She allows each character to hold their convictions without undermining them or making them into soapbox orators. The films condemnation of war isnt Iraq-specific. Its antiwar in a more general way because it sends idealistic boys into harms way but it embraces the brawl-and-banter camaraderie of military life and the basic loyalty of men trying to keep their buddies alive.

Brandon King (Ryan Phillippe left) and Steve Shriver (Channing Tatum) are two best friends trying to cope with the return to civilian life in Paramount Pictures drama Stop-Loss. Photo Paramount Pictures Stop-Loss 1 / 2 Back to Gallery According to a post-script at the close of Stop-Loss at least 81000 American troops have been recalled to serve in Afghanistan and Iraq after completing their previous terms of duty. The plight of these men and women and the frustration of their families is surely a worthwhile subject for a film. So is the post-traumatic fallout of those who return in one piece or less from the bloody fray of war. The Best Years of Our Lives Coming Home Flags of Our Fathers In the Valley of Elah the list goes on and on forming a small difficult subgenre of movies as much concerned with internal combat as the battle on distant shores. Stop-Loss aligns itself firmly with this tradition. If it fails as a whole its not for lack of trying - and there are individual scenes that display an unaffected force and poignancy gone missing from the rest of the film. A sequence in an American military hospital in which injured vets employ false limbs and genuine spirit throws off such welcome sparks of life that I wondered why the entire plot werent set there. Those are characters worth visiting. Thats the movie to see. But not these characters; not this movie. For her first effort since 1999s arresting Boys Dont Cry writer-director Kimberly Peirce revisits the rough terrain of a troubled identity but here she turns away from transgender issues (can a woman be a man?) to consider the mental state of soldiers coming home (can they ever really?). ``You know that box inside your head where you put all the (stuff) that you cant deal with? Well mines full says Staff Sgt. Brandon King (Ryan Phillippe) explaining his reluctance to head to the front. Yet hes been ""stop-lossed - that is forced to return after two full tours in Afghanistan and Iraq. Its the small print (the ``back-door draft he calls it) that remands veterans to combat and hes having none of it. Bucking against the army the law and his buddies from Iraq Brandon goes AWOL and the movie dutifully follows frequenting seedy motels and dark-alley confrontations while the agitated sergeant flashes back to Tikrit. His friends and soldiers have problems too The aimless Tommy (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) turns to drink haunted by the death of his best friend; the hospitalized Rodriguez (Victor Rasuk) recovers from shattering wounds; and Sgt. Steve Shriver (Channing Tatum) presumably no relation to the Kennedy politico gets rough with his fiancee (Abbie Cornish) and insanely digs a foxhole in his yard. None of this is poorly done. But its claustrophobic Chris Menges cinematography so dusty and broad in The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada closes in tight on every scene even at Brandons Texas ranch. And aside from the Rodriguez subplot Peirces screenplay (co-written with Mark Richard) stops a few yards short of convincing. Its more a sweaty assemblage of dramatic high-points than a coherent persuasive story of wounded warriors trying to make it. One drawback I have to say is Phillippe. He is not a bad actor. I commend him for choosing roles in serious-minded films. But he portrayed a similar character in Clint Eastwoods Flags and he exhibited a similar shortcoming an inability (or plain reluctance) to broadcast inner torment. Oh hell yell when he needs to hell wince on cue hell sport a gash along his perfect forehead but that roiling substratum of psychological pain just refuses to surface. We dont see it in the moment he goes AWOL and we dont feel it in his agonized decision at the finish. The climax simply happens. The story simply ends abandoning viewers along with those 81000 stop-lossed veterans who deserve a better movie. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals GameStop Summer Sale Banana Republic Final Cut Sale Up to 75% off + free shipping...

Her last -- and first -- was the indie feature ""Boys Dont Cry"" which helped Hilary Swank take home her first Oscar. ""Stop-Loss"" produced by MTV Films and co-written with Mark Richard is Peirces long-awaited sophomore film.  RATING | Soldiers Stories Although there are moments of the awkward melodrama in this ambitious war/home-front film this is no slump effort. Anchored by deft performances from a sturdy ensemble that features Ryan Phillippe and Channing Tatum (but also includes Ciaran Hinds and Linda Emond in key roles as parents) ""Stop-Loss"" provides proof of Peirces sensitivity with actors as well as her interest in stories of American folk who dont often get the close-ups they should. The title refers to the Pentagons policy of retaining and redeploying soldiers and reservists after their contracts are up. Staff Sgt. Brandon King (Phillippe) leads his men with a steady reserve. Early in ""Stop-Loss"" when random gunfire sounds he is a voice of alert calm. When a car seems to rush the checkpoint in Iraq his cooler head prevails. A second car revs toward the checkpoint. This time it opens fire. A chase ensues. So does a disastrous ambush in a tight space. King loses some of his men. Dead civilians lie next to dead Iraqi fighters. When Sgt. King and Sgt. Steve Shriver (Tatum) return home from this harrowing tour in Iraq they fully expect to be ""getting out."" Instead Sgt. King is stop- lossed. Phillippe and Tatum are engaging as best friends who played football under the Friday night lights of Brazos Texas; enlisted in the Army after 9/11; and have had each others backs in Afghanistan and Iraq. Their homecoming though loving isnt easy. A commanding officers speech about DUIs fighting with civilians and hitting loved ones goes unheeded by a number of Kings men. Post-traumatic stress is thick in the air. Most troubled is Pfc. Tommy Burgess (Joseph Goron Levitt) who begins wrecking his marriage almost immediately. In the midst of this fog of war King still leads. When King goes AWOL the movie goes from an impressive coming-home tale to a more standard-issue road movie. Abbie Cornish plays Michele. A lifelong friend and Shrivers fiancee she drives the bureaucracy-shocked Brandon to see a senator who had glad-handed the hero at a welcome-home event. Still hitting the road lets the movie delve further into the impact of the war (but also the stop-loss policy) on soldiers and their families. In the opening scenes of the film before the ambush we see video of ""Preacher"" Colson dipping best friend Tommy in a baptismal pool made of sandbags and water. Brandon and Michele seek out Preachers parents in Tennessee. We also see Rico Rodriguez played with a vibrant smile by Victor Rasuk fooling around. He suffered burns and lost limbs. The pair visit him at a VA treatment facility. A telling moment comes when King meets another former soldier on the ""lay low"" in a Memphis motels parking lot. The man an African-American likens the lawyer who helps AWOL soldiers across the Canadian border to an underground railroad figure. King a Texan considers him a coyote. When we meet the attorney in a New York City restaurant hes more predator than savior. Peirce has a sharp eye for rich details the anxious chatter coming over the radio at a checkpoint; the dropped baton at a small-town parade; the faces of two military moms listening to drunken soldiers recount fantasies of retribution at a party thats starting to go south. But she never passes judgment on these soldiers. Far from it ""Stop-Loss"" is full of tender regard for them and their families. Film critic Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 or lkennedydenverpost.com.

Comments Stop-Loss Ryan Phillippe Channing Tatum and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are Iraq veterans feeling the aftershocks of their experience as they return to their stars-and-stripes Texas town; the rub comes when Tatum and Phillippe are ordered back to Iraq through the U.S. militarys stop-loss policy assailed here as a backdoor draft. This is Kimberly Peirces first film since she debuted with Boys Dont Cry (1999) and though its intentions are noble its hampered by a stock romantic subplot (Phillippe falls for his friends squeeze Abbie Cornish) a familiar structure (since The Best Years of Our Lives soldiers invariably come home in threes) and a lack of symmetry (some of Gordon-Levitts story seems to have wound up on the cutting-room floor). With Ciaran Hinds and Linda Emond both strong as Phillippes parents. R 113 min. By J.R.

"Back from Iraq but not feeling at home - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsReal EstateLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review Back from Iraq but not feeling at home Email|Print|Single Page| Text size - + By Ty Burr Globe Staff / March 28 2008 ""Stop-Loss"" is co-produced by MTV and the soundtrack consequently works overtime. Heavy metal alt-pop southern rock orchestral swells wailing Middle Eastern tunes all vie for our attention but none of this noise drowns out the sound of good intentions twisting themselves into an impotent knot.The movies the latest off-Hollywood drama to examine the effects of the Iraq War on the US soldiers fighting it and like previous films - ""In the Valley of Elah"" ""Home of the Brave"" ""Lions for Lambs"" ""Redacted"" - its earnest outraged and more than a little confused. Pundits wonder why no one wants to see these movies and its true American audiences dont have the stomach for bad news (especially when its about us) but cant the films themselves be at fault too?In ""Stop-Loss"" writer-director Kimberly Peirce (""Boys Dont Cry"") tells a story of Texas buddies who grew up together and shipped out together; now theyre back home and a mess. The first 15 minutes of the film are set in Iraq and shot as is the fashion with a shaky you- are-there digital camera. We see a checkpoint incident lead inexorably to a back-alley ambush - order devolving into chaos - and the worst part is that the scene feels all too familiar by now.Then almost magically were back in small-town America with the locals asking the returning soldier boys ""Hey we winning this thing?"" Says Sergeant Steve Shriver (Channing Tatum) ""Were killin em in Iraq so we wont have to kill em in Texas"" but the truth is hes brought the enemy back with him. Shriver gets so drunk his first night home hes scared to go inside; he just digs a foxhole in the front yard and goes to sleep.Hes still a pillar of strength next to Tommy Burgess (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) the kind of twitchy psycho veteran the movies have been mining since the first wave of Vietnam films. The third main character is squad leader Brandon King (Ryan Phillippe) like Shriver a former high school football god turned mortal.Brandon is holding it together more or less until he learns the US Army intends to forcibly re-enlist him using the backdoor loophole known as ""stop-loss."" ""With all due respect sir [expletive] the president"" he tells his startled commanding officer (Timothy Olyphant). Then he goes AWOL.The problems with the film are twofold. First Peirce wants to pile every calamity afflicting Iraq War veterans onto her narrative. Alcoholism domestic abuse PTSD night terrors suicidal behavior prosthetic limbs - what starts as drama becomes unrelieved litany.She also insists on stuffing her valid concerns about the stop-loss policy and other issues into the cramped box of Hollywood convention. Once underground Brandon tries to contact his US senator (Josef Sommer) for help but instead of picking up the telephone he drives from Texas to Washington D.C. Why? Because the director wants to make a road movie - an odyssey across the scrapheap of post-tour America.And since there has to be a girl Brandon is accompanied by Michelle (Abbie Cornish) his best friends fiancee. Cornish first landed on the radar with her messed-up sexed-up teenager in the 2004 Australian drama ""Somersault"" and shes much the best thing here big-boned and disgusted with the nonsense of Texan boy-men.There are moments during Brandon and Michelles wanderings where Peirce gets to some ugly truths about life in America the despairing exhaustion of an invisible underclass (here the ""lay-low soldiers"" who live entire lives on the run) a two-tiered system of race and class where the family of a Mexican private (Victor Rasuk) gets green cards only if he dies. The scene in which Tommy and his fellow vets use his wedding presents for target practice says everything about the resentments of inarticulate men and with the necessary gallows humor.But you know where Tommys headed - yes you do - and once he gets there ""Stop-Loss"" comes undone. A climactic scene at a funeral is dreadfully written acted and shot the mark of a good filmmaker clutching at straws and the ridiculous ending is nothing less than a slap in our face. Peirce wants to leave us with something heavy to ponder but Ill be damned if I can figure out what that is.Phillippe strikes an appealing if thin pose of righteous martyrdom but Tatums Shriver is ultimately the more interesting figure - a hulking smart/stupid Army lifer who just wants to go back to Iraq so he can kill the hadjis in his head. ""Let me be the faceless enemy"" he says and right there is what the rest of ""Stop-Loss"" fruitlessly seeks the panic of a good old boy in a bad new world.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

(See related story here.) With a young attractive cast Stop-Loss would seem the most likely to appeal to a bigger audience. And a younger one to boot. Unfortunately the film makes all its points in broad predictable strokes (with the exception of the ending). Perhaps because shes worried that the target audience might overlook the points shes making co-writer and director Kimberly Peirce leaves nuanced storytelling behind. Ryan Phillippe stars as Sgt. Brandon King who is with his men at a traffic checkpoint in Iraq when we meet him. The routine checks quickly escalate into a bloody battle in a nearby alley. Peirce ratchets up the tension and the excitement in expert fashion. Its one of the best battle scenes in any of the recent war films made all the more remarkable by virtue of this being only the second feature Peirce has directed (after Boys Dont Cry). Soon King and his friend Steve Shriver (Channing Tatum) are on an Army bus talking about their imminent discharge on the way home to their small Texas hometown where theyre welcomed as heroes. Thats where the trouble begins for both the characters and for Stop-Loss. King learns that he has been ""stop-lossed"" - ordered back to Iraq for another tour despite having finished his stint. To this point King had been a soldiers soldier. A natural leader his men trust him with their lives. He joined up for all the right reasons (the movie takes great pains not to question the war itself but the administration of it). But this is too much. King tells his commanding officer (Timothy Olyphant excellent in a small role) hes not going back. Not a good plan. Soon King is AWOL with Shrivers girlfriend Michelle (Abbie Cornish) in tow. His basic plan is to visit the senator who decorated him and ask for help. Along the way Stop-Loss becomes a kind of weird road film as King and Michelle make various stops. They visit the family of one of Kings men who was killed in battle. Theyre introduced to a group of other stop-lossed soldiers who put King in touch with a lawyer who specializes in relocating the soldiers and their families to Canada. They stop off at a military hospital to see another of Kings men who was maimed in battle. They travel back to Texas for a funeral. Meanwhile on the home front things arent going so well for Kings buddies. Shrivers contemplating re-enlisting as a sniper while Tommy (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) struggles without Kings leadership to guide him. Peirce obviously wants us to see King exhausting his options. But she would have done better to pick one path and stick with it. Stop-Loss goes in too many directions at once and most of those directions are predictable. The ending is not. At first blush it seems to further confuse the issue. Yet its apt because confusion is the state these men spend a lot of their time in. Phillippe is surprisingly effective as King a man who loves his country but feels betrayed by it. And Stop-Loss is obviously an earnest effort by all concerned. But war is complex as are our reactions to it. The movie would have done well to let those who watch it connect their own dots to not spell things out so clearly to not show us everything. Let us figure out some things for ourselves. Its a more satisfying experience and were up to the task. Reach Goodykoontz at 602-444-8974 or bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Its not hard to theorize about how the movie came undone The director and co-writer Boys Dont Crys Kimberly Peirce lived and worried through her own brothers deployment to Iraq. And she incorporated stories he told of soldiers devastated by Stop-Loss -- a policy that allows the military to send servicemen and -women back to combat even after theyve served out their military contract. In some sense Peirce is a horrified civilian trying to keep everyone safe. And so as if to touch wood and keep away the jinx Peirce seals off each of her characters soldiers as well as loved ones at home in emotional Bubble Wrap. Sgt. Brandon King (Ryan Phillippe nicely acquitted) is the designated anguished recipient of Stop-Loss orders. Hes a good son of Texas who having seen raw battle in Iraq just wants to come home to American peace -- no word what hell do for a job in this stricken economy -- but instead receives orders to reload and return overseas. He balks considers bolting either north of the border or south and drives around America with his best friends girl (Abbie Cornish). The best buddy (Channing Tatum) also a soldier re-ups but not before a discrete bout of post-traumatic stress during which he punches his fiancee in the eye. Peirces intention in cataloging even a handful of the wars staggering home-turf losses is heartfelt. Theres a Texas pal (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who cant find his emotional way home. And theres a gravely wounded comrade (Victor Rasuk) whos chipper as a salt-of-the-earth type out of The Best Years of Our Lives and who stands in for the hundreds now being fitted for prosthetics in Stateside Army hospitals. But Stop-Loss holds so much of its rage in check -- and keeps such a nervous eye on the attention span of its audience -- that it ultimately strangles itself. All its power is boiled away to a soft unfocused story about the moral strain of making difficult choices. In contrast the movies early more improvisational-looking scenes of overseas Army life and a harrowing well-staged ambush and skirmish sequence set in Tikrit alleyways (and shot in Morocco) capture the hell that has already claimed the lives of 4000 U.S. troops with fierce energy.

But something ties the two films together. For a Feminist Studies type Peirce has an uncanny knack for getting inside the heads of young men for making you feel how powerfully their identities are bound up in their masculine relationships and rituals. Stop-Loss doesnt come together but in its ungainly way it evokes the anguish of American shit-kickers whove lost all sense of autonomy. The movie centers on three Texas soldiers (Ryan Phillippe Channing Tatum and Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who return from Iraq after an ambush that left some of their friends dead and maimed and another barely suppressing his inadvertent killing of civilians. That battle is the opening sequence and Peirce makes you understand on a gut level the adrenaline-fueled hyperawareness of these men at a checkpoint as they almost fire on a car with a family speeding toward them then the unreality of the moment when insurgents in another speeding car open fire on them. When its all over and the Americans roll into Texas on a bus ready to be discharged you get a palpable sense of how wound up they areitching to get drunk and laid and court oblivion. They barely make it through the parade and speech of a U.S. senator before theyre throwing back shots and retching and punching people out and having the requisite war flashbacks. The films title refers to the presidential prerogative of extending a service members enlistment contract beyond its expiration date in times of wara backdoor draft that according to the movies postscript has kept 81000 Americans and counting in uniform. The most stable of the three protagonists Brandon (Phillippe) learns he has been stop-lossed when he goes back to base to get his discharge papers and although he comes from a military family and has no evident problems with the war he refuses on the spotthen punches out two guards and goes AWOL. Phillippe has never struck me as much more than a pretty face but his underplaying works here. He doesnt transform into a grandstanding actor; he looks completely at sea. When his pal Steves fiancee Michelle (Abbie Cornish) volunteers to drive him to Washington D.C. to get help from a senator who promised him the world Stop-Loss becomes a road moviean odyssey that leads the pair to the family of a lost friend a fleabag motel where another awol stop-loss casualty hides out with his wife and sick kid and a hospital where Brandons squad mate Rico (Victor Rasuk) lies blind and severely maimed. Its ironic that Stop-Loss loses its momentum when the characters go on the road. Yet Rasukthe star of Raising Victor Vargasgives a stunning performance He plays Rico as upbeat almost content knowing that Iraq was payback for 9/11 and determinedly building up his one remaining bicep. And by rights this part of the film should crawl along and go essentially nowhere. Brandon whose life is bound up in his role as a soldier has no real recourse; and Peirce and her co-writer Mark Richard have no answers. The power of Stop-Lossand this is no dumb jokeis that it shows its hero between Iraq and a hard place. -- David Edelstein Related Stories New York Magazine Reviews David Edelsteins Full Review (4/7/08) Advertisement Top 10 Movies Star Trek Beyond The Secret Life of Pets Ghostbusters Lights Out Ice Age Collision Course Finding Dory The Legend of Tarzan Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates Hillarys America The Secret History of the Democratic Party The Infiltrator Advertising On The Set of Jill Soloways I Love Dick The Great British Baking Show Recap Rough Puff Outcast Recap Sympathy For the Devil The Great British Baking Show Recap Lady Fingers TV Review BoJack Horseman Gucci Mane Is Better Than Hes Been in Years Absolutely Fabulous The Movie Is Only Semi-Fab Copyright (c) 2016 New York Media LLC.

Auds heretofore resistant to Iraq War-themed pics likely wont be lured to the megaplexes by ""Stop-Loss"" a wildly uneven drama by turns sincere and synthetic about a decorated Army sergeant whose homecoming is cut short when hes unexpectedly ordered back to the war zone. Helmer Kimberly Peirce (""Boys Dont Cry"") working from a script she co-wrote with Mark Richard charts a bumpy road trip through familiar territory where vividly drawn characters rub shoulders with stock stereotypes and persuasive verisimilitude is too often overshadowed by contrivance. Expect a short tour of duty in theaters before a quick transfer to homevid. Opening minutes crackle with energy as Peirce and ace lenser Chris Menges employ variegated film stocks to create faux homevideos supposedly shot edited and scored by U. S. troops in Iraq (a fact-based conceit they sporadically reprise throughout with steadily diminishing effect). But this testosterone-fueled montage quickly gives way to an impressively staged and powerfully kinetic battle in Tikrit as Staff Sgt. Brandon King (Ryan Phillippe) and his men pursue insurgents who have fled their roadblock. King displays courage under fire but some of his men (and a few innocent bystanders) dont survive the deadly encounter. Shortly thereafter King and a few buddies are shipped back to their warmly welcoming friends and family in the small town of Brazos Texas (much of ""Stop-Loss"" was shot in and around Austin). King is proud to receive both the Purple Heart and the Bronze Star from a visiting senator (vet stage and screen actor Josef Sommer making the absolute most of minimal screen time) but hes more interested in simply returning to civilian life. Unfortunately his discharge is delayed by ""stop-loss"" a controversial policy whereby the military can indefinitely extend enlistments and send soldiers back for second or third tours in Iraq. Peirce and Richard bend over backward to portray King as a model soldier and genuine patriot who rebels against the stop-loss order not because of cowardice or politics but because he feels personally betrayed by a government hes already served far beyond the call of duty. This characterization may enable some otherwise disapproving auds to accept Kings impulsive decision to go AWOL. Accompanied by Michele (Abbie Cornish) the girlfriend of Kings more conventionally gung-ho buddy Steve (Channing Tatum) the angry soldier sets out for Washington D.C. in the naive hope that he can plead his case to the senator who recently honored him. Along the way he takes side trips to visit and/or honor former comrades even as he remains the target of a nationwide manhunt. Peirce reportedly was inspired to make ""Stop-Loss"" by her brothers experiences serving in Afghanistan and Iraq and by accounts of real-life soldiers who defied their stop-loss orders. And yet huge swaths of her pic play like mash-ups of features from the 1970s and early 80s about distressed or disturbed Vietnam War veterans. Indeed the more dedicated deconstructionists in the audience will identify various influences reflected here ranging from the blatantly obvious (""The Deer Hunter"") to the relatively obscure (""Heroes"" Jeremy Kagans 1977 cross-country odyssey with Henry Winkler as a troubled vet). Theres even a hint of ""First Blood"" in a scene where King opens up a can of whup-ass on punks who break into his car and trigger his wartime flashback. Phillippe is creditable and credible -- he even manages a convincing Texas twang -- and there are standout supporting performances by Tatum (despite his lack of an equally believable drawl) Victor Rasuk (as a battle-scarred Hispanic soldier) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt (as a fellow Iraq vet who finds peace can be hell). But Ciaran Hinds is criminally underused as Kings supportive father and even some of the better actors are hamstrung by the scripts cliches; at least one key character is so obviously fated for an unhappy ending he might as well have a vulture perched on his shoulder. The ending of ""Stop-Loss"" may be attacked by some critics (especially those with a political agenda) as a bases-covering cop-out. But its actually one of the most dramatically and emotionally sound elements in the entire pic. Mores the pity then that so much of what precedes this finale seems secondhand and second-guessed the work of well-intentioned filmmakers whose stumbling efforts suggest that much like the Vietnam War the Iraq War wont inspire truly great and substantial dramas until the passing of time allows for perspective. Credit lenser Menges and production designer David Wasco for giving pic (including battle scenes shot in Morocco) at least a patina of truth.
