Im sorry make that Transformer action figures. But if he did upon my return from Transformers Revenge of the Fallen I would have taken these Hasbro toys outside placed them under the wheels of the car and driven back and forth across them until they were ground into dust. My motivation would not be revenge for the lost hours Ive now devoted to the Transformers (well maybe a little). No if this sequel taught me anything it is that vigilance is required where these pesky robots are concerned. The Decepticons had supposedly been vanquished in the highly successful 2007 Transformers but here the bad robots all were again invigorated anew. It seems someone forgot to sweep up after that movies climax leaving a shard of the precious knowledge-giving Cube on the clothing of teenage hero Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf). (See TIMEs top 10 fictional cars.) He didnt wash that sweatshirt because when youve helped one set of alien robots defeat another you need a memento. But he shakes it out while preparing to leave for Princeton unintentionally rebooting the whole conflict. The shard infuses him with great genius -- the Cube being the source of all alien-robot knowledge -- making him once again the Decepticons main quarry. And once again it takes director Michael Bay 144 minutes and a tremendous amount of firepower and heaving bosoms to re-vanquish the Decepticons. Even then it still seems highly likely that the worst of them a black hulk bearing an uncanny resemblance to Mont Saint-Michel (yes the French island town) will live to see a third movie. I suppose in my driveway antics Id run the risk of squashing an Autobot one of the good robot aliens as well. If either Mudflap or Skids a pair of new characters who speak in an appallingly offensive ghetto patois were my victims I could live with myself. The world doesnt need more versions of Jar Jar Binks. But what if it were the Autobot leader Optimus Prime? Optimus truly cares about the future of the human race unlike the Obama Administration which Bay represents as so prissy and antiwar it just wants the alien robots off the planet. Bays Obama would probably drive his Prius over Optimus if he had the chance. But no problem; if you still had your hearing in the deafening home stretch of Revenge of the Fallen youd know that just about any chunk of metal can be brought back to life by merging the Matrix with its Spark. (Im fairly sure this process has nothing to do with Keanu Reeves. As for the Spark without benefit of the Hasbro manual its impossible to say whether it is of the plug family or something more ephemeral like Chi.) (See ""Cinemas Most Memorable Robots."") Ehren Kruger Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman share the writing credit for this astonishing mishmash of Hasbro advertising copy and every movie in the good-vs.-evil ilk. But Revenge is director Michael Bay at his purest gleaming machines humans that glisten with an omnipresent layer of sweat dozens of locations and a story line so messy it borders on the abstract. Hes even given one of the Decepticons testicles (brass swinging). The whole experience is like having your nose pressed into Bays manly armpit for 21/2 hours. I somehow missed Bays first Transformers two summers ago. Id like to think I magnanimously stepped aside to give some eager young male colleague the pleasure of reviewing it. Perhaps I feigned illness. Watching it on DVD this past week I found it more fun than I expected and loads better than the sequel. I even became almost fond of Bumblebee the Autobot/Camaro who functions as Sams pet and protector even as the premise of vehicles morphing into robots continued to seem preposterous to me. But I had to admit the conceit was also undeniably impressive in its attentiveness to the interests of small males. Some of the Decepticons even look like dinosaurs which borders on pandering to 5-year-olds. If Hasbro could engineer such an adaptable delight why not a toy for girls that is both an Easy-Bake oven and a princess? Which brings us to Mikaela (Megan Fox) Sams polymer princess whom Bay treats as if she were last months Penthouse Pet with a mixture of disdain and need. ""Youre hot but you aint so bright"" one robot tells her and you wonder if it is speaking the bosss mind. Later it humps her leg. Throughout all this Fox appears stoic perhaps because shes concentrating on keeping her lips permanently parted and wet (she looks as if shes been interrupted in the midst of dining on lobster with drawn butter). Mikaela is worried about Sam going off to college and she should be Princeton is rendered as a Playboy mansion with dorms. The movies main romantic tension revolves around the fact that she and Sam still havent said ""I love you"" although they have had sex. We know this because Sams mother Judy (Julie White) heard them. She divulges this information while high on a pot brownie she accidentally ate on Sams first day at college. Please dont judge Judy. The whole Witwicky family speaks at warp speed so it is a challenge to make out all that they say (LaBeouf in particular is like John Cusack on amphetamines) but Judy and her husband Ron (Kevin Dunn) are the movies main sources of comic relief. Or maybe my affection for them had deeper psychological roots. Maybe I saw them as my allies. The movie is like the play date from hell the kind where a crew of children reduce your home to rubble and conduct endless bouts of loud war on the living-room floor while you ponder the propriety of opening a bottle of wine. On occasions like that another set of parents no matter how irritating can be as welcome as Optimus Prime rising from the dead. Ask movie producer Jerry Bruckheimer your questions.

If you are 14-year-old boy or have the mind-set of one youll probably be enthralled by Michael Bays ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen."" I wasnt (the understatement of the year). But I would like to think that even if I was 14 either in body or spirit I would still find this film an impossibly incomprehensibly overlong and cacophonous bore. Maybe they should have called it ""Transformers Revenge on the Critics."" Or how about ""Transformers Revenge on Every Sentient Being Except 14-Year-Old Boys Who if They Repeatedly Revisit This Movie Will Lose Their Hearing in Five Years""?For the record Shia LaBeouf along with the military and Autobot leader Optimus Prime is once again battling Decepticons.

About five guys on Earth have access to the kind of budget Michael Bay does yet all the man does is offer up slow-motion explosion after slow-motion explosion. OK sure he throws in a scantily-clad Megan Fox in for effect too. Super. But plot? No. Logic? Negative. Any semblance of a coherent story whatsoever? Nope. But then it hit me like a ton of Transformer this was actually better than the first one. No kidding it seems as though The Bay is evolving. So I have to give a bit of credit where its due there. No this isnt a film for folks who want to engage intellectually with a movie but it is summer escapism. Fine. You win world. Sam Witwicky and his parents rock the house again I know everyone was concerned for the human lead characters in erm Transformers so I can tell you they are back in fine form. Back too is the hottest auto mechanic in history Megan Foxs Mikaela Barnes. Oh to be transported to the mystical world where a gal can fix a car without getting her hands dirty. All the Autobots and Decepticons youve fallen in love with are accounted for too with the only caveat being you cant really tell who is who on the bad guy side. Something about the one size fits all ""grey-silver blade"" look they all sport. But it hardly matters. You know something is fighting something else and that will have to be enough for your ten bucks. Its another big story spanning the globe with end-of-the-Earth implications. The military boys are locked and loaded the bad guys are snarling and vengeful the Autobots are moral compasses. It adds up exactly as youd think if youve seen a moving picture before; the motivations are simple while the laughs pound you about the head and face. At 150 minutes Transformers Revenge of the Fallen could have used a bit of editing but when every explosion has essentially the same value what would you cut? Its a classic filmmakers dilemma. Now then Im dinging this film for a few reasons. One is the continued insistence that were supposed to care about the human element of the giant metallic fighting robot war. I dont and I cant. The other is Bays love of testicle jokes and ""madcap"" Three Stooges-style fun. First hes got dogs humping each other. Then a tiny Transformer humping a gals leg? Really? Is that where were at? Are the rest of our screenplays to be written in crayon with only the drool from our big dumb mouths providing color? I lament for the industry. But then I think of Dark Knight and Iron Man and hell even the new Bond series and find some solace. There are guys out there who know how to provide escapist entertainment while not asking us to turn off the part of our brain that thinks -- its just that this guy this isnt one of them. At least not with the Transformers series. However the C grade isnt meant to be all that bad. The first hour passes fine and the culmination is of course a huge spectacle. The film is comprised of an artificial momentum with fake moments all over the place but it is CGI-riffic. At the very least its worth watching as a learning tool. Those who can turn off their brain and just enjoy the shiny things and multiple explosions will rise up in defense of this film. Those who note the bushels of logic flaws will be miserable throughout. Im somewhere in the middle as for minutes at a time I was able to enjoy Megan Fox running away from things. At other junctures I was perturbed by Bays apparent lack of respect for the audience or himself. I suppose the saving grace of this film is that in ten years no one will talk about it anymore.

And thats just Megan Fox  there are also those cool robots. Actually the camera lingers more lovingly on the Fox than the bots which transform so cartoonishly fast that any pretense of reality is instantly vaporized. Much of the movie is computer-generated hash weightless even with nonstop BOOMS and METAL GROANS and THUDS. Foxs jugs in contrast have verisimilitude  and heft. I have a soft spot for director Michael Bay probably because the South Park guys wrote a song about how much he sucks while at the same time Ridley Scott makes movies that win Academy Awards. Theyre not that different. From time to time Bay even shows a better grasp of action than the director of Gladiator. The Island was more exciting than you heard and the first Transformers had its modest charms. But Transformers 2 is self-parody. I saw the movie in Imax and its a feat to shoot an Egyptian pyramid with the biggest cameras ever created and make you say Eh. Whatever. The man who directed Pearl Harbor now depicts the annihilation of an American aircraft carrier with indifference  for a kick. He has no shame. The premise? Bad transformers want to obliterate Earths sun and Shia LaBeouf says Its not my battle because he wants to be normal and get a college degree. His college is populated with stacked women in micro-miniskirts which makes me think the extras casting session was the real place to be. Shia changes his tune when he starts spontaneously scrawling alien hieroglyphs like the guy in A Beautful Mind except with no chance for an Oscar. Meanwhile alien robots  led by ""the Fallen""  hover just outside Earths orbit plotting their revenge for something. I was never quite sure. Youd need an evolved alien brain to be able to follow the battle scenes. With apologies for my alien-racism at these speeds all transformers look alike. Transformers 2 features two squabbling jive-talking robots that made me think back fondly on Jar-Jar Binks. How sad it must be to be one of the talented computer artists who spent months and many millions animating their slapstick fight which people at my screening watched in dead silence. (My 11-year-old daughter Lucy mounted a halfhearted defense ""8-year-olds might like it."") The actors stare dutifully at FX To Be Animated Later paid too well to show their boredom but unable to show much else. Theyre blank slates their minds wiped clean. I dont have much nice to say about Transformers 2 but Im happy to see my Park Slope neighbor John Turturro get another big paycheck  and hes very funny given the Drake-and-Josh level of the jokes. Theres a terrific bit with a blonde coed who transforms into a killer-bot  but her send-off goes by so fast that the audience doesnt even have a chance to say Yeah Kill dat bitch Theres also a gorgeous effect in which thirteen transformers hurtle down from space into the desert sand  thump thump thump thump  and the colossi slowly rise from the smoke. But then they start blasting and its back to video-game weightlessness. I remember in the eighties watching The Howling in which a man slowly morphed into a werewolf His flesh quivered and his snout crunched out of his flesh and the bones in his feet cracked and elongated. Why cant these transformers transform so that we marvel at their metamorphoses? Cant 200 million dollars buy that much? Oh well  back to La Fox. The camera first ogles her in short shorts and cowboy boots astride a motorcycle. Later she wears white pants that appear to have had the air vacuumed out of them for maximum cling and a plunging blouse that makes her dash from robot projectiles  in slow motion arms pumping  even more suspenseful. As she emerged from a desert dust storm with her pillowy lips wet and glossy I was reduced to ga-ga-ga-ga Theres an old joke about a guy interviewing for a lion-tamer job who watches his female competitor shed her mink to reveal her naked breasts which the lion contentedly licks. The circus owner says Can you do that? and the guy says Can I? Just get that lion out of there I feel the same way about Transformers 2.

By David Denby Johnny Depp plays John Dillinger in Michael Manns film.   Credit Illustration by Robert Risko Michael Manns ""Public Enemies"" is a ravishing dream of violent gangster life in the thirties--not a tough funny and finally tragic dream like ""Bonnie and Clyde"" but a flowing velvety fantasia of the crime wave that mesmerized the nation early in the decade. The scowling men in long dark coats and hats led by the fashion-plate bandit John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) march into a grand Midwestern bank with marble floors and brass railings take over the place throw the cash in bags and make their getaway jumping onto the sideboards of flat-topped black Fords--beautiful cars with curved grilles and rounded headlights that stand straight up from the cars bodies. Its the American poetry of crime. Throughout the movie blazing tommy guns emit little spearheads of flame just as in a comic book. Men get their skulls bashed with gun butts and get thrown out of cars but despite all the violence the movie is aesthetically shaped and slightly distanced by the pictorial verve of gangland effrontery--the public aggression that Mann makes inseparable from high style. He keeps the camera moving and the editing (by Paul Rubell and Jeffrey Ford) reinforces the speed without jamming ragged fragments together in the manner of hack filmmaking. As a piece of direction ""Public Enemies"" is often breathtakingly fast but its always lucid. The high-definition digital images are crisply focussed and much of the movie (in contrast to the usual shock-and-awe thunder of action films) is on the quiet side. Billie Holidays plaintive tones show up on the soundtrack a touch of melancholy high civilization amid the mayhem. Some of the dialogue is spoken sotto voce--in a darkened restaurant say or the back of a car where suave hoods lean toward each other exchanging confidences. Like Barry Levinsons ""Bugsy"" the picture happily exploits what movies can do to create a sinful nexus between criminality and elegance. Dillinger himself went to the movies on the last night of his life (an event recreated here); at times he seemed to be modelling himself on the dapper William Powell. Most of the thugs and the lawmen too dress in perfectly tailored suits and wear their pomaded hair swept back like the grilles of those fast cars. Theres almost an unspoken compact between director and audience in a movie like this a compact of pleasure in everything looking so good. Twenty-five years ago in ""Miami Vice"" Michael Mann brought visual glamour to television; hes still an incomparable maker of svelte flawlessly integrated images. Yet for all its skill ""Public Enemies"" is not quite a great movie. Theres something missing--a sense of urgency and discovery a more complicated narrative path a shrewder tougher sense of who John Dillinger is. The bank robber had a brief run as a national figure. Paroled after nearly nine years in the Indiana pen on May 10 1933 he rampaged his way around the country often living openly in Chicago and smaller cities and was shot dead by a variety of cops and agents fourteen months later on July 22 1934. As the movie tells it (Mann wrote the screenplay with Ronan Bennett and Ann Biderman adapting Bryan Burroughs 2004 book also called ""Public Enemies"") Dillinger was a gentleman thug loyal to his friends and to his hat-check girlfriend Billie Frechette played by Marion Cotillard with a combination of desperate hope and fear that is enormously appealing. Relaxed and assured Depp with his fine sharply cut features and lithe body turns Dillinger into a supremely confident young man. ""What do you want?"" Cotillard asks him. ""Everything right now"" he says. Its the quintessential movie gangsters demand although Depp speaks softly without the snarling boastfulness of the great actors (Paul Muni James Cagney Edward G. Robinson) who played gangsters when Dillinger was alive. Theres a faint tone of mockery in Depps mildness in his secret half smile though his face can darken with rage. Mann and Depps idea of Dillinger as an unruffled prince of crime is extremely enjoyable. Yet as the movie goes on you begin to question whether it makes much sense. ""Public Enemies"" chronicles not only Dillingers wild fourteen months but the parallel rise of organized crime (represented as an Italian gent in a dressing gown giving orders on the telephone) and also the development of a national crime-fighting force--a nascent F.B.I. Billy Crudup who has done inventive work onstage in recent years returns to the movies with a brilliant piece of high comedy. His cheekbones built up his handsome features on the verge of disappearing into jowls he plays the young but already insufferable J. Edgar Hoover as a bullying righteous and wary man a natural-born populist authoritarian. One of Manns wittiest accomplishments is to recapture the stiffly formal side of official life in the thirties the pompous tone of bureaucracy and media too--the sound of a newly powerful country trying to impress itself with its own importance. Special Agent Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) whom Hoover puts in charge of the Dillinger hunt acts out the role of a formidable national guardian. In the past Bales guttural delivery as if his vocal chords were soaked daily in testosterone never seemed anything but an actors trick. Hes a tight dour minimalist performer not very likable. But hes effective here as a man driven by a single purpose--to see Dillinger dead one way or another. Bale makes Purvis very still very concentrated the frightening embodiment of the Law. Outgunned at first by the criminals Purvis with Hoover pretending not to notice hires some trained killers from Oklahoma and Texas. The rival gangs of outlaws and ""lawmen"" duel back and forth and the movie rushes through increasingly vicious gun battles and narrow escapes for Dillinger and his friends. Some of the shoot-outs--especially a mad nighttime pursuit of the irrepressibly gun-happy Baby Face Nelson (Stephen Graham)--are as flamboyant and as satisfying as a dream. But Mann oddly doesnt seem to take sides. In ""Bonnie and Clyde"" we were clearly meant to warm up to the outlaws--not just to the two lovers but to the entire group who became an extended quarrelling family and also folk heroes in a Depression-era country both bored and broke. But Dillingers popularity is only hinted at in a couple of scenes and Mann as he did in ""Heat"" divides his admiration evenly between criminals and cops. Both are risking everything. The movie is structured around repeated scenes of wounded men (agents as well as criminals) dying as they look into the eyes of their friends. Yet some of the dying men are barely known to us and the device though beautifully staged in each case doesnt have the power it should have had. The movie is emotionally neutered. ""Public Enemies"" needed a charge of surprise and I wish the filmmakers had more forcefully developed two ironies embedded in the material. For all of Hoover and Purviss talk of ""scientific methods"" the new F.B.I. wins the war not by arresting criminals and sending them to prison but by massacring them. And Dillinger as the movie readily shows is deluded about himself. He embraces the future but actually his time is over; the new crime syndicates dismiss him as a troublemaking fool. And although the screenplay keeps insisting that hes intelligent and shrewd the movie demonstrates the opposite. The character doesnt quite add up. If he had been given a wild destructive streak the conception might have made more sense but Mann seems to trip over his own story by making Dillinger so self-contained and cool. The problem with casting a star as low-key and attractive as Johnny Depp is that you cant turn him into a man who is at bottom a loser. ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen"" directed by the stunningly almost viciously untalented Michael Bay is much closer to the norm of todays conglomerate filmmaking. Two sets of leaden-voiced plastic-and-metal monsters the Autobots and the Decepticons having failed to settle their differences over a parking space on an alien planet fight it out on Earth--with human beings in the dubious form of the teen couple Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox in the middle. Apart from the frustrating truth that its often impossible to tell the warring creatures apart--both sets are huge black gleaming clanking with many arms and appendages--they obey no rules that would make their combats a struggle of courage against limitation and therefore worth caring about. Achilles and Hector had spears and shields. These things can fly climb knock over walls bore holes change shape back into cars or trucks dance the cancan in the pre-First World War Folies-Bergere. There isnt much they cant do and their endless struggles are redundant and undifferentiated. The movie rages on for a hundred and fifty minutes and then just stops pausing for the next sequel. In the middle of the battles the American military in the form of recruiting-poster scrambles in the Egyptian desert joins the creatures in destroying the Pyramids and other temples columns and monoliths. Its all a rambunctious movie lark of course but if you were an Egyptian wouldnt you be a little annoyed by the casual imperial thwacking of sacred places?

This little boys own fantasy of adult war games draws on everything from Indiana Jones to The Mummy and even Harry Potter as it scatterguns from university campus to the Gulf and then the pyramids of Egypt.Shia LaBeouf is ably hampered by his comical parents (Julie White and Kevin Dunn) and John Tuturro reprising the role of Agent Simmons (clearly a relative of Seinfelds Soup Nazi) who manage to create the only real characters in two and a half hours of souped-up extreme sound and light. Hes also notably enhanced by Megan Fox who plays her role as sexy girlfriend to perfection. She keeps her lips and butt inflated never gets a mark on her pants never makes a memorable remark and runs with a set of pneumatic boobs that bring new meaning to the word suspense (she has been rewarded for her efforts by knocking Angelina Jolie from her spot as the worlds top female action star).I saw Revenge of the Fallen at Imax which is probably why I managed to stay awake in what for me was the worlds most boring movie. But Im also happy to report I was the only person in the audience who wasnt utterly entranced. Transformers 2 from Michael Bay the director of numerous remakes is totally awesome if nothing else.

Shia LaBeouf returns as the teenage hero now off at college whos drawn back into the intergalactic war between the altruistic Autobots and the evil Decepticons. The special effects are better and the dialogue slightly more humorous than in the first movie but the anti-Arab subtext is repugnant the ensuing armageddon destroys both an Egyptian pyramid and part of the antique Jordanian city of Petra.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Its tempting to dismiss Michael Bays long loud and ludicrous sequel to2007s Transformers with one word -- hunkajunk. On every level this movie is as bankrupt as GM. But there is more to be said about a movie this gargantuan (200 million spent on robot hardbodies) and galactically stupid. Transformers The Revenge of The Fallen is beyond bad it carves out its own category of godawfulness. And please you dont have to remind me that theriginal was a colossal hit (700 million worldwide) and the sequel will probably do just as well. I know its popular. So is junk food and they both poison your insides and rot your brain. But I do accept that Bay is unique. No one can top him for telling a story with such striking shrieking incoherence. More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Bay picks up the Transformers story by sending Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeoufelling every line of dialogue) off to college leaving behind his mechanic girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox). Lets pause a moment and talk about Bay and his masterful objectification of women. He intros Fox in tight shorts bent over a motorcycle. I can almost hear Bay behind the camera like a porn director whos captured a clone of Angelina Jolie ""Push that butt out Megan twitch it. Now turn bend show the rack. Now lick those lips pout that pout. Hey makeup we need more lip gloss."" He even brings in another hottie Isabel Lucas as Alice another student who never cracks a book. I assume this is Bay U. Alice gives Sam tongue in ways you wont believe. Oh where was I? Yeah the bots. Sam also leaves behind his first love. Thatd be Bumblebee the yellow Camaro who morphs into Sams robot guardian angel when needed. Hes letting his friends the Autobots led by Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) work out their differences with the feds. But what of the devious Decepticons led by Megatron and The Fallen? Do you think theyll escape confinement and try to destroy the world in battle scenes where you cant tell whos fighting who? Do you think Bay cashes his paycheck? The plot devolves into a chase story in Egypt and the destruction of theyramids. More importantly the story answers the question of who will say ""I love you"" first -- Sam or Mikaela? Ill never tell. I have to salute Bay for helping to create two of the most offensive bots in screen history -- Skids (Tom Kenny) and Mudflap (Reno Wilson) Chevy concept cars who do black stereotypes in ways that would shame Jar Jar Binks. But Ive said enough. Go ahead have your senses senselessly pounded for two and a half hours. And please its not that I hate robot movies. I stand second to no one in admiring the power and dark poetry that James Cameron brought to the first two Terminator films. I even have a dream that the great bots of movie history -- Robby Gort HAL R2-D2 C-3PO the alien from Alien the sentinels from The Matrix and all the Terminators -- will one day march on Bay who is the true Decepticon. Disguised as a human director Bay is actually a destroyer of dreams. When Hasbro invented those Transformers toys the intention was for kids to use their imagination about what those bots would morph into. Bay crushes that imagination with his own crude interpretations that seem untouched by human hands and spirit. I know there are still 17 months to go but Im thinking Transformers 2 has a shot at the title Worst Movie of the Decade.

Michael Bay has learned that action film fans like to see action. Hes taken his head out of his keister and his camera out of the Transformers tailpipes. Sometimes you can even see all four limbs of an Autobot as it slugs a Decepticon. The blow makes a satisfying ""Kkrasggsh"" For a second youre having a good time. Treasure it. Another thing Michael Bay learned from his start-up Transformers is that audiences dont have to like a movie to spend buckets of money seeing it. An event franchise that hasnt yet worn out its welcome swaggers into the summer knowing that there is a month of barbecues ahead where people will be asked if they saw it and will want to be informed enough to say it was crap. Freed from the pressures of making something good Bay can fill up the space between battles with trash and convince himself and us that everyone else eats it up. When we go to a lousy popcorn movie we convince ourselves that the strangers around us loved it. They--not us--are to blame for Bays trust in the lowest common denominator. As though our money arrives in his billfold with an asterisk. The script is written by Ehren Kruger Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman (the last two fresh off Star Trek where they must have burned off their inspiration) and at least in this sequel theres slightly more of the things that most scripts have like characters and plots. Theres also more idiocy. Thought the dog peeing on Optimus Prime was lame? Now therere two dog-humping scenes and a third where a microbot has its way with Megan Foxs leg. Thought the jive-talking Jazz was borderline offensive? Now therere two of them Skids and Mudflap who despite their red and green paint jobs are unmistakably meant to be black. Worse than their gold teeth and cackling accents is what they say like ""We dont really do much reading."" Thought the script showed little understanding of the concept of Transformers? Here an aged Decepticon named Jetfire boasts that his father was the very first wheel--never mind that it was made of wood or stone. At least the Transformers have overcome their masturbatory fixation on shouting their own names but the dialogue replacing it is swiped from playground bullies or Vegas comics. The thrust of the story is that Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is off to college his tearful goodbye with Bumblebee interrupted when Bay gets restless and splices in a shot of Foxs white panties as she changes clothes outside the garage. Bays impatience with human emotions continues to show; the main arc for Fox and LaBeouf is who will say ""I love you"" first a tired saw the flick shoves in whenever the two are alone and have to speak. Theyre also facing the danger that LaBeouf will replace his hot mechanic honey with someone college-educated but luckily for the couple the one co-ed putting the serious heat on Foxs man turns out to be a disguised Decepticon with a deadly chainlink tongue (an Attracticon?). Meanwhile the military and the Autobots--led by Optimus Prime channeling a godlike Daniel Craig--have formed an alliance to take down the sporadic Decepticon insurrections which may or may not have something to do with a pyramid in Egypt. (Okay okay they do.)  The 40-minute climatic desert tussle must have had a big budget for goats and chickens which along with diminutive actor Deep Roy stand in for the majority of the locals. Other delights (deliberate and not) Shias girlish scream. Megans gift for running while holding hands. Hurricanes of harmless shrapnel. Small bots that all look like Lil Wayne. A jaguar-shaped Decepticon who spits up ball bearings for hairballs. That New York a city where last week the Times ran a piece on a famous stray cat takes no notice of an Autobot on the Brooklyn Bridge. An extended scene of Sams mom eating a pot brownie. Ponderous inanities like when a soldier muses of Optimus ""If God made us in his image who made him?"" Its dreck but face it--well all pay for the displeasure. 0 Comments Be the first to comment You must be logged in to post a comment.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Weve been here before. An improbable project based on a kitchy source wows audiences and even critics. Then the anticipated sequel comes up short. One case in point the theme park inspired ""Pirates of the Carribbean"" and its waterlogged sequel. Similarly ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen"" has odd origins the popular Hasbro toys that switch from cool vehicles to cooler robots and back. And so too is its sequel troubled. If the pre-sold midnight screenings Wednesday morning were any indication the movie will make money hand over fist this weekend. .) But like its alien robots the nearly two-and-a-half-hour movie is unweildy. Sporadically fun ""Transformers"" more often lumbers -- loudly proudly -- as it delves (well deeper isnt quite the word) into the ancient antagonisms of the decent alien Autobots and deadly Decepticons. Shia LaBeouf returns as Sam Witwicky the kid the Autobots sought out in their ages old fight with the Decepticons. Headed to college hes leaving behind Mom (Julie White) Dad (Kevin Dunn) and his girlfriend Mikaela played by Megan Fox. Last but hardly least hes saying goodbye to autobot Bumblebee (Mark Ryan). Theyve upgraded the sentimental machines guise from classic Camaro to a newer model. This switch could be a metaphor for a franchise that has already lost sight of its own old-fashion charms of character in the pursuit of flash. At school Sam finds a geek roomie (Ramon Rodriguez) and a disturbingly forward coed (Isabel Lucas). Initially Sam is unaware that hes got a head full of knowledge the vanguished Decepticons (including the Fallen of the title) want. As the information manifest itself he looks like hes caught between a seizure and a very bad trip. Meanwhile Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) is still a metallic paragon of virtue. Even as the government (represented by the stereotypically officious bureaucrat) begins to suspect Autobots are not protecting earth but putting it at risk of attack Optimus argues for humankinds better angels. In turn Capt. Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and Sgt. Epps (Tyrese Gibson) do the similar advocacy for the Autobots. The script is by Ehren Kruger and Robert Orci and Alex Kurtzman the duo who made ""Star Trek"" so out-of-this-world and the next. And strewn throughout the film are glimmers of their wit. Rainn Wilson makes an amusing appearance as an astronomy professor. Dunn is game and dear as Sams pragmatic and loving pop. But theres a kind of entropy at work here. The right notes are struck over and over for the target demo but theres not much for the rest of us. The special effects are no longer quite so special. A fact that doesnt stop Bay from committing more-is-less excesses. ""Transformers"" recovers some in the third act thanks to an amusingly unhinged performance by John Turturro as former special ops agent Simmons and the introduction of a decrepit Decepticon. While the fate of this orb hangs in the balance a pressing question throughout is Whos gonna blink first and confess the L-word Sam or Mikaela? Not matinee idol foxy LaBeouf remains an intriguing performer to pin studio dreams on. His gift for snark and hysteria serve him well. Fox on the other hand is arguably the dullest beauty being touted for celebrity. Mikaelas written to have grit (she works at her dads motorcycle shop after all). But the filmmakers shoot Fox for teen boy (and old-guy) fantasies. Sure the film teases us with a heroic pairing for a generation of gender savvier guys and gals. But it comes up about as short as the daisy dukes Mikaela wears when we first see her. Film critic Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 or lkennedydenverpost.com.

The documentary film was written and directed by Clay Tweel. Photo Open Road Films By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Updated July 30 2016 155 p.m. ET 3 COMMENTS The subject of Clay Tweels superb documentary feature is Steve Gleason the former New Orleans Saints safety who was diagnosed with ALS or Lou Gehrigs disease in 2011. Shortly afterward Mr. Gleason started chronicling the progress of his disease in a video diary but six weeks later he and his wife Michel learned she was pregnant. At that point the diary became for the most part a series of straight-to-the-camera messages to his son Rivers both before and after the birth. ""My intention"" he says at the outset when his speech is still unimpaired ""is to pass on as much of who I am as I possibly can to you."" What was meant as a gift to his son is a gift to anyone who watches the film which incorporates Mr. Gleasons home videos in a profile of almost unfathomable courage--hes still very much with us although his body has been ravaged by the disease--and a portrait of a profoundly good man. ENLARGE Michel Gleason Steve Gleason and Rivers Gleason. Photo Open Road Films ""Gleason"" is so powerful in its cumulative effect that it should be accompanied by a consumer advisory--something along the lines of ""This documentary may cause sudden alterations of mood and attitude."" I can attest to having been undone by at least one scene and Im far from an easy weeper; its a confrontation between Mr. Gleason and his own father a man with rigid notions of good and evil. The moment is at once heart-rending and transcendently beautiful and father-and-son themes play in parallel throughout the film or perhaps they intertwine in a double helix. Mr. Gleason is determined to be a better father for his son than his father was for him even though he must speak through a voice synthesizer by the time Rivers is starting to talk. More Reviews Jason Bourne Indignation Summer Movie Preview Interactive Watch trailers and read more about the summers crop of films The film is authentically inspiring but also unsparing in its depiction of the horrors of ALS and its impact on the family. (The implacable strength of Michel Gleason could be the subject of a separate film.) The disease moves swiftly attacking Steve Gleasons spirit as well as his body. There are times captured by the unblinking camera when his agonies seem unendurable yet he has rejected assisted suicide and chosen to live out a life that brings joy with the pain. In one conjunction of more emotions than can be put into words we see him struggling to breathe while he watches Rivers struggling to blow out all four candles on his birthday cake. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download The Theory of Everything (2014) Eddie Redmayne stars brilliantly as the cosmologist Stephen Hawking who at age 21 was diagnosed with a motor neuron disorder related to Lou Gehrigs disease and given two years to live. More than half a century later hes still going strong. See James Marshs movie as a companion piece to ""Gleason"" an enjoyable demonstration of the difference between nonfiction films that can enthrall and informative features that entertain. 353 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Thats a line from ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen"" but funnily enough its also what I think every time I sit down to watch a Michael Bay movie. As you can probably guess from the title ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen"" is the sequel to Bays hugely successful 2007 ""Transformers"" and its roughly more of the same -- and yet less. ""Revenge of the Fallen"" picks up two years after Sam Witwicky (the perpetually clueless-looking Shia LaBeouf) and the Autobots have saved the human race from the Decepticons. Dont clutter your head with worrying about exactly what this means Bay and his screenwriters Ehren Kruger and Roberto Orci sure didnt. All you need to know is that the Autobots are good and the Decepticons are bad; both are humanoid robots that can fold themselves up into various vehicles and other mechanical objects. (This is a movie franchise based on a toy after all -- a credit line at the beginning tells us its being presented in association with Hasbro.)Now the Decepticons are back to stir up trouble -- their aim is to destroy the sun; why not? -- and Sam whos just headed off to college must temporarily put his education on hold. Meanwhile his girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox) prances about in teeny-tiny shorts and other assorted form-fitting garments. She makes her entrance crouched on the seat of a motorcycle her pert butt aimed at the heavens. Later in the movie a once-aggressive robot shes befriended and tamed eagerly humps her leg. This is what it means in the Bay universe to be a movie sex symbol.In ""Revenge of the Fallen"" the action jumps from Los Angeles to New York and other points on the East Coast as well as to France and Egypt. We must of course end up somewhere in the desert so Bay will have a chance to give us lots of scenes in which soldiers (theyre part of a top-secret outfit called NEST who work with the Autobots to keep Earth safe and theyre led by stalwart Capt. Lennox once again played by Josh Duhamel) get to shoot the bejesus out of the enemy among the dunes. The plot of ""Revenge of the Fallen"" is extremely busy without being particularly rewarding Theres something happening every minute including lots of clumpy robot battles in which its impossible to tell whos coming from where. Bay seems to think that just showing us a bunch of brightly clashing metallic limbs (accompanied by lots of noise) is enough to make us faint in our seats with excitement. You Might Also Like Of course all Michael Bay movies are loud He accessorizes his shoddily conceived and executed action sequences with heaps of gunfire explosions and crashes ostensibly to make them more thrilling. But if ""Transformers"" was loud ""Revenge of the Fallen"" is louder. You could argue that in the first movie Bay at least attempted to make us care about the human and robot characters particularly Bumblebee (voiced by Mark Ryan) the sensitive robot/car who becomes Sams guardian; here theyre an afterthought a shadowy sidecar to the action. ""Revenge of the Fallen"" is also exceedingly crass. I dont believe its the job of movies to safeguard the purity of our youth. At the same time Im not sure I see the point of robots using words like ""bitch"" and ""pussy"" in a movie inspired by a line of toys. ""Revenge of the Fallen"" just comes off as a bratty kid showing how many swear words he knows. Bay is a purveyor of clunky occasionally enjoyable crap I sometimes get pleasure out of his movies by marveling at the astonishingly low level of craftsmanship that he consistently gets away with. (My favorite is ""The Island"" a fine example of futuristic claptrap.) And maybe ""Revenge of the Fallen"" is no worse than any other Bay movie You probably cant sink much lower after making a piece of pseudo-historical hokum like ""Pearl Harbor."" Still big dumb and clumsy is no way to go through life. ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen"" is shiny and loud all right. But do you really want it humping your leg?

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 24 2009 933 AM Transformers Revenge of the Fallen Why cant robots get along with other robots? By Dana Stevens After youve seen Transformers Revenge of the Fallen come back and listen to our Spoiler Special discussion of all the twists and turns You can also click here to download the MP3 file or youll find this and dozens of other Spoiler Specials in our iTunes podcast feed here. Transformers Revenge of the Fallen Transformers Revenge of the Fallen (Paramount Pictures) Michael Bays latest bid to bludgeon audiences into dulled submission is the reductio ad absurdum of a summer blockbuster. It is loud (boom) long (two and a half hours) incoherent (poorly explained intergalactic warfare) leering (Megan Fox in short shorts) racist (jive-talkin robot twins) and rife with product tie-ins (Chevy Hasbro). Transformers will also pack audiences into theaters with the ruthless efficiency of a Decepticon one of the evil mega-robots who battle the good-guy Autobots for the length (let me repeat 2.5 hours) of this nerve-crushing excruciation. John Yoo would not be able to draft a memo excusing the torment this movie inflicts on its audience yet tens of millions of us will line up to shovel money at it this weekend. God bless America. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Ill put as much effort into explicating the plot as the movie does Two years after helping to save the human race from the Earth-invading Decepticons Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is just an ordinary kid packing for his freshman year at college. Hes leaving behind Bumblebee a sentient yellow Camaro that transforms into his guardian robot and Mikaela (Fox) a Maxim-cover-worthy girlfriend who looks like a pneumatically inflated and sun-charred Jennifer Connelly. But then Sam taking an old jacket from his closet finds a shard of the Cube the all-important cosmic McGuffin of the first Transformers movie. Damn you shard If not for you the millennia-old war of the Autobots and the Decepticons would never have needed re-waging and this movie would never have existed. Advertisement Thanks to the evil shard Sams brain is imprinted with a series of runic symbols that he obsessively paints on his dorm room walls. Theres something that hes meant to do something that involves helping the goody-goody robot Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) put down a rebellion led by his ancient rival the Fallen (voiced by Tony Todd). The deep mythology of their enmity is amply revisited in multiple expository flashbacks but the simplest thing Bay could have done to clarify the stakes of the robot wars would be to visually distinguish the robots from one another in some way. Armbands? Shirts and skins? ""Hello My Name Is"" stickers? As it stands these clanking heaps of car parts are so inexpressive that you lose track of whos hurling the peak of the Great Pyramid at whom. The first Transformers movie was also assaultive to the senses but it knew its place in the pop-culture pecking order Its a franchise based on a line of toys for Gods sakes and the 2007 film had the sense to treat the lumbering Autobots as essentially the fantastical playthings of its adolescent hero. With Revenge of the Fallen Bay abandons any pretense of wit. Instead solemn expressions of wonderment at the robots largeness (""If God made us in His image who made them?"") alternate with puerile jabs at comic relief such as a miniature robot who humps Megan Foxs leg and the aforementioned ghetto robot twins asking each other ""Whassa matter witchu?"" When first invited by Optimus Prime to aid the Autobots in their struggle Sam resists saying ""This isnt my war."" Eventually of course hes drawn into caring about the alien battle but the audience never is. The cacophonous final showdown between Jetpack and Camshaft or whatever the last robots standing are named takes place in some abstract dimension of pure blockbusterdom impervious to human identification or emotion. It isnt my war and if it rages on into the summer of 2010 I plan on defecting to Canada.  The one redeeming feature of Transformers Revenge of the Fallen is that it provides an excuse for the years first Slate movie contest. The Transformers franchise is based on a line of Hasbro toys and their tie-in cartoon. Looking back at the toys of your youth can you come up with a title and tag line for a summer blockbuster? (For example My Little Pony Reign of Buttercup Sprinkles.) Send entries to slatemoviesgmail.com with the words ""contest submission"" in the subject line. Ill accept submissions until 5 p.m. Monday June 29 and publish the results late next week. Give it a shot; you couldnt do worse than Michael Bay.

The Autobot Optimus Prime has his work cut out for him in Transformers Revenge of the Fallen. Photo PARAMOUNT PICTURES Transformers Revenge of the Fallen 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Long long ago hairy people with face paint were minding their own hunter-gatherer business when large intergalactic robots suddenly plopped out of nowhere. The hairy people hefted their mighty spears and bared their mighty teeth but alas they were smooshed underfoot. Thus began humanitys first encounter with Transformers a mechanized alien race that can morph from robot to internal-combustion transport (sports car 18-wheeler plane etc.) and back again in less time than it takes homo sapiens to pry open the package on one of those selfsame Hasbro action figures. And thus begins Transformers Revenge of the Fallen a well-oiled loudly revving summer action vehicle that does all thats required and then some within the confines of PG-13 It cracks genitalia jokes messes around with toys and blows stuff up. Revenge of the Fallenis the sequel to 2007sTransformers-- also directed by Michael Bay also exec-produced by Steven Spielberg also co-written byStar Treknerd-kings Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci. Shia LeBeouf returns as Sam Witwicky the spunky human teen appointed by fate to assist the wise ginormous Optimus Prime (the voice of Peter Cullen) and his band of goodly Autobots on a quest to defeat the evil ginormous Megatron (The Matrixs Hugo Weaving) and his band of loathsome Decepticons. When we last left them a bunch of Decepticons had been chucked into the North Atlantic and Sam had started to get it on with gal-pal Mikaela (Megan Fox). Fast-forward two years. The Autobots -- who now include a pair of trash-talking Chevy Aveos -- are allied with American and British forces in an effort to smoke out Decepticons whove been hiding out on Earth as for instance heavy machinery. Subduing one such bot in Shanghai Optimus disses him (""punk-ass Decepticon"") and asks if he has any last words. Turns out he does ""The Fallen shall rise again."" And who pray tell is the Fallen? A bitter outcast flung from grace -- something as Miltonian as he is metallic. Meanwhile Sam is embarking on a normal life as a college dude or so he thinks. While packing he happens across a sliver of the AllSpark (basically a mystical cube that holds the key to the Transformers existence) which zippety-zaps alien glyphs directly into his brain and turns small kitchen appliances into Decepticons. The subsequent humming plot involves Sams wussy college roommate (a constantly screaming Ramon Rodriguez) and lots of fabulous clashing titans with a hot-wax shine. Funny percussive and 20 minutes too long the film could do with less of its overserious Pyramids battle climax which features the obligatory slow-mo-with-salvos war imagery and just for good measure the mortal takedown of a major character set to dirgelike vocals. I might be alone in this but I prefer my movies about colossal talking robots to unfold without Elysian choirs. Then again this is a Michael Bay joint. Hyperbole is his middle name whether it applies to the length of a movie (Pearl Harbor was 183 minutes) the slowness of its motion (again Pearl Harbor was 183 minutes) or the dreamy swoop in its romance (Pearl Harbor was ... never mind). Yet the beauty of the Transformers franchise is its limited room for pomposity. Its about playthings big playthings making loud noises in a giant sandbox known as Egypt. Vroom-vroom. Crash-bang.

This is blockbuster porn absent even the suggestion of care or concern for anything that might resemble ""a point"" save the obvious one to move more Hasbro action figures and animated-series DVD boxed sets. In a word distasteful. And if the above resonates with anger . . . no not at all--only the extreme annoyance born of absolute disappointment.Plot? Theres a plot? You dont say Directed by Michael Bay and co-written by the men responsible for Star Trek ROTF is rumored to have something to do with a matrix keymajiggy that unlocks the sun-killing whoziwhatsis and the never-ending smash-up derby pitting Autobot against Decepticon. You may recall that its 2007 predecessor was a mostly capable commercial for Transformers toys and Bays previous films from which most of the iconography was lifted as the man continues to pay homage to his favorite filmmaker. (Has he ever made a movie without the image of fluttering American flags?) Transformers was actually Bay at his most surprisingly reflective and unexpectedly restrained--the domestic scenes involving Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) and his parents (Kevin Dunn and Julie White) felt particularly sincere--and also his most ingenious as he merged man and machine in beautifully choreographed fight sequences and literally has us wondering ""Howd he do that?""Well hes done it again--it and nothing more--and so the trick no longer dazzles. Which isnt to suggest that Bays not entirely into it--there are scant moments when he seems to be paying attention such as a sequence during which a resurrected Megatron (hoo-boy) kidnaps Sam and fills the kids orifices with insect-like Decepticons who slither around his innards for a look-see. Bays in touch with his inner Cronenberg during this lone profoundly isolated moment the one scene during which you can actually tell whats happening--and to whom because he lets the gross-out speak for itself.But why speak when you can SCREAM for almost two and a half hours? Why go subtle when theres shit to blow up? Which is most of the problem Its astonishing how exhilaration can give way to boredom in movies starring special effects. Even the leading man is annoyed Where Sam spent the first film as a wide-eyed reluctant hero charged with saving the world with his yellow Camaro and weirdly too-hot girlfriend (Megan Fox the sole survivor of the real Cybertron) here hes just bothered by the whole scenario (and thats well before the creepies crawl under his skin). The Autobots are now working for the government rooting out Decepticons around the world (psst ones doing heavy labor in Shanghai) and Sam just wants to go away to college--where of course hes saddled with an aggressively annoying roommate (Ramon Rodriguez) who accompanies LaBeouf and Fox for the for the rest of the movie joy. But a respites not to be--not when the Fallens gotten back up after a 19000-year rest somewhere in orbit around the earth which hes looking to destroy just because he can. Kind of like Michael Bay.

Starring Megan Fox Shia LaBeouf Rainn Wilson Josh Duhamel John Turturro Director Michael Bay Running time 237  Editorial Review With its fascist sensibility assortment of smutty asides illiterate gold-tooth-wearing homie robots and the heros brainless mother much of ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen"" is simply despicable. So complaining about ones physical discomfort seems petty. But given the relentless din the Leni Riefenstahl-inspired music and the headache-inducing visuals OSHA should probably be investigating the conditions under which human beings made this thing. Or the conditions under which they watch it.And this is from someone who liked ""Transformers."" Sure it was a clanking clanging rock-em sock-em robot slugfest but with a human element that was surprisingly real. Shia LaBeouf held his own alongside his 14-story co-stars Megan Fox added fleshly decor and the whole thing was kind of funny. Although the action was huge the feeling was intimate For much of the film Sam Witwicky (LaBeouf) was trying to keep the existence of the enormous shape-shifting Autobots a secret so there was not only situational comedy -- there was also a sense that the audience was in on a well-meant conspiracy.Not so this time. The whole wide world -- and more -- is in on the ""Trans 2"" experience. Or soon will be. Since the absence of the Allspark or life force has made the Autobots planet uninhabitable theyve moved in with us like unwelcome relatives and have been working with the U.S. military. Why are aliens always working with the military here? Why not Venezuela?Anyway the Autobots and the Army are looking for rogue Decepticons and keeping the world safe. But not for long The ancient origins of the Autobots and evil Decepticons -- including a literally satanic mastermind known as ""the Fallen"" -- will come to the fore with Earth the sun the pyramids and Sams fledgling academic career at what as well might be called Nymphomaniac Supermodel University all on the line.As with so many sequels anything that worked in the first film is ratcheted up to overkill. To say the film is too loud or relentlessly violent misses the point We watch movies like this for noise and violence. But whats wrong here is that theres so much swirling relentless action indistinct robot characterizations and over-caffeinated techies loose on the special-effects machines that the movie in mere seconds achieves incoherence.-- John Anderson (June 24 2009)Contains sexual content vulgarity intense action crude humor and drug content.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Ive just spent 2 1/2 hours watching a movie and another hour thinking about what I saw and I have no earthly idea what ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen"" is about. (About an hour too long perhaps.) There is a semblance of a plot. Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox return as Sam and Mikaela whose romantic pairing is again the most suspension-of-disbelief-straining element in a film about giant alien robot warriors that live among us disguised as General Motors vehicles. Caught in the midst of battles between nasty Decepticons and human-friendly Autobots the kids race from California to the Mideast looking for the suns ""off"" switch installed long ago by extraterrestrial bad guys. But combing through this audiovisual blitzkrieg for logic substance and character is like looking for the poetic subtext of a monster-truck rally. The film exists as a pure sensory event a pummeling thrilling bewildering demented exercise in computer-generated shock and awe. Director Michael Bay sprays visceral thrills at us with a fire hose. Aircraft carriers are torn in two. Tanks are scattered like bowling pins. Paris is strafed and the Pyramids are reduced to rubble. Mechanoid behemoths pound the rivets out of each other. Megan Fox straddles a motorbike in cutoffs that would give Daisy Duke heart failure. Oh sorry spoiler alert. Whether you love or hate ""Revenge of the Fallen"" will depend on how you feel about crashes explosions gunfire and hot chicks. (Sam spends one day in college where the student body seems to have been admitted on the basis of their modeling portfolios.) If your reaction is ""Yeah bring it on"" ROTFs garish spectacle will fill you with childlike glee. If your standards are more demanding ROTF will make you ROTFL at best. TRANSFORMERS REVENGE OF THE FALLEN  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for sci-fi action violence language some crude and sexual material and brief drug material. Sometimes we yearn for a movie that will allow us to turn off our minds but ""Return of the Fallen"" doesnt respect our intelligence. When the film shows us the Pentagon Bay helpfully supplies a subtitle explaining ""The Pentagon -- Washington D.C."" A Parisian sequence features a couple eating escargot in a sidewalk cafe and being accosted by a mime because as you know this is what happens in France. The script is an avalanche of genre cliches. There are notions scenes and dialogue lifted verbatim from ""Close Encounters"" the Indiana Jones movies ""Gremlins"" ""Star Wars"" ""The Matrix"" and the ""Terminator"" franchise. The comic relief is as overdone as the pyrotechnics. Bay includes two shots of a Chihuahua humping a pug and follows it up with a lusty little robot doing the same to Foxs leg. Returning as Agent Simpson John Turturro exposes his pasty mudflaps for no earthly reason and the expanded Autobot team introduces a pair of jive-talkin carbots that are the most tactless ethnic stereotype to hit science fiction since Jar Jar Binks. With choice dialogue like ""Punkass Decepticon any last words?"" youre grateful that most of the talk is drowned out by explosions. I still wish I hadnt heard Turturro calling in an artillery strike from between a behemoth robots legs say he was right underneath the things -- er -- Decepticles. Acting is forbidden in Michael Bay movies so its forgivable that Fox poses her way through every scene of danger romance or high jinks with the same moist-lipped vacant air. She does a fine job of running away from explosions in a skintight halter top an action she is called on to perform 7005 times. LaBoeuf has a couple of Jerry Lewis moments when implanted alien information comes spilling out at college. Oddly its Kevin Dunn and Julie White as his sit-commy mom and dad who create the films most full-bodied characters. Despite a load of sentimental gloop about Mikaelas undying devotion to Sam and his parents difficulties letting go the movies emotional high point is his farewell scene with Bumblebee his yellow-and-black Autobot protector who doubles as his Chevy Camaro. The big lug cries buckets of wiper fluid as Sam leaves home. With 42 new robot characters its difficult to sort out the various giant Tinkertoys smashing each other in the frenetic battle scenes. The conflicts make about as much sense as sandlot battles fought by 8-year-olds wielding their Hasbro Megatrons Starscreams and Optimus Primes. Its all sound and fury signifying nothing. Bay has unleashed his inner child with the most expensive toy set in the world. ccovertstartribune.com  612-673-7186 View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

(Paramount Pictures) By Ty Burr Globe Staff / June 24 2009 Email| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Transformers Revenge of the Fallen is - theres no polite way to say this - 2 1/2 hours of tumescence disguised as a motion picture. Giant robots smash each other to rivets Shanghai and the Egyptian pyramids are reduced to rubble fighter jets scream across the sky bombs burst in air and Megan Foxs measurements are deployed on the screen for maximum effect.Admit it Your inner teenage boy went into a blissful coma just reading that sentence.You dont have an inner teenage boy? Sorry youre out of luck. The sequel to the 2007 summer hit ""Transformers - based on the Hasbro line of snap-together battle-bots and thus the ultimate toyification of American cinema - offers nothing for mature adult sensibilities. On the contrary it laughs at the very idea and then blows more stuff up. Fast deafening and dumb the movie is total nonsense and will make a fortune. But its a Michael Bay project and the man does have the lack of shame to go with his deficiency in basic storytelling skills.Shia LaBeouf returns as Sam Witwicky the teenage hero - now bound for college - whos the human emissary between the Autobots (good) and Decepticons (evil) alien mecha-thingies whove made Earth their last-stand battleground. This being a sequel the villainous Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving) isnt quite dead yet and the core group of Autobots led by Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) is filled out by various clanking newcomers. (If youre a fan you already know whos here; if not its not worth the bother.) Megatrons boss a sort of silver-plated Lucifer figure called The Fallen (Tony Todd) has aims on Sams brain which has become imprinted with ancient runes leading to a doomsday device. But silly me Im talking about the plot which is the least of the movies concerns.This being a sequel the running time is also padded with comedy. Sams dumb-cluck parents (Kevin Dunn and the unstoppable Julie White) get a lot more screentime as does the intense government nerd played by John Turturro who knows a good franchise when he lands in one. Some of the laughs are genuine although a little of Ramon Rodriguez as Sams fraidy-cat roommate goes a long way.Some of the new bots are fairly clever too an old codger (Turturro again) a sassy little Brooklynite voiced by Tom Kenny. Theyre dopey enough to drive the fanboys nuts - oh the disrespect - but they do liven up the show. Still what are we to make of Mudflap and Skids (both Kenny) a pair of shuck-and-jive Autobots who talk in ridiculous gangsta-speak. The insultingly unfunny comic relief of ""Transformers theyre Jar Jar Binks times two and the first known example of robot blackface.Technically of course the movie represents state-of-the-art CGI overkill with metallic behemoths that roar and unpack themselves and leap tall buildings and are forever smashing the masonry. Theyre visually astonishing and ultimately exhausting. All Bay knows is the action that never stops the detonations that reach orgasmically ever higher the chase scenes that build and crash and build some more.So what if he cant put a coherent series of shots together? Bays going for pure sensation and everyone knows dramatic continuity is for women and the weak. ""Revenge of the Fallen is the kind of movie that puts the Rockies in New Jersey that appears to send the heroes into the Smithsonian from Washington D.C. and back out into the Southwestern desert and if you want to complain text someone who cares.Anyway the director would rather let his camera caress Fox as Sams bodacious grease-monkey girlfriend the kind of woman who can keep her lip gloss fresh in the midst of global apocalypse. Bay knows shes a critical part of the fantasy just as Isabel Lucas as a college co-ed with a Freudian nightmare of a tongue is part of his audiences primal anxieties. ""Revenge of the Fallen could use some time on the couch one character tasers himself in the testicles and the Constructicon called Devastator is startlingly well-equipped. Bay may be the face of the new blockbuster fascism but he and his constituency might want to work out the kinks before they dominate the planet.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Transformers Revenge of the Fallen Add to ... Liam Lacey From Wednesdays Globe and Mail Published Tuesday Jun. 23 2009 433PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 319PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Transformers Revenge of the Fallen Directed by Michael Bay Written by Roberto Orci Alex Kurtzman and Ehren Kruger Starring; Shia LaBeouf Megan Fox and John Turturro Classification PG The big question about Transformers Revenge of the Fallen is which of your favourite household machines you should take as a date? Your electric toothbrush would surely enjoy the speed and the flying debris but might whine at the scary parts. Your blender would get a kick out of the editing but if its still under warranty and impressionable the experience might be a bit overwhelming. Theres no question the new Transformers film from director Michael Bay feels as though it were directed for and perhaps by robots. Bay fills the screen with a hurricane of scrap metal and military hardware in sequences that are almost avant-garde in their repetitive incoherence. Yet this sense-pounding exercise is not without some design. Bay has taken certain tendencies of Alfred Hitchcock and Steven Spielberg - the love of monumentality and flurried editing - and pushed them to new extremes perhaps as a way of proving there are still big-screen experiences that you really cant duplicate at home. For those late to the party Transformers is derived from an early 1980s series of toy cars that could be twisted into little robots. In the mythology of the characters (developed as a Saturday-morning cartoon) all the robots come from another planet and there are good ones called Autobots and bad ones called Decepticons. The biggest machines typically speak in growly voices and say things like ""Fate rarely calls upon us at a moment of our choosing"" while the humans yell things like ""Look out"" as they fly across the screen. Bays first Transformers movie in 2007 made more than 700-million (U.S.) worldwide. This time the director has pushed the bigger-is-better formula even further with more robots more fights and a 2-hour running time. Though the Decepticons appeared to be defeated in his first movie theyre back (and will return for the projected third film in the franchise). In an early scene they destroy a good chunk of Shanghai. Afterwards the Autobot leader Optimus Prime appears on a video screen to a bunch of Pentagon soldiers to warn that the Decepticons have issued a sort of biblical warning that ""the Fallen"" shall rise again. Theres a strand of a human story on which the massive action scenes are hung. Near the films beginning Sam (Shia LaBeouf) the hero of the first Transformers movie has to say goodbye to his favourite machine a big yellow guardian robot Bumblebee before heading off to college. While going through his old clothes Sam gets some of the robots magic mineral called Autospark in his system. By the time he reaches college hes turned like Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind  twitching and babbling writing notes all over the walls and drawing strange symbols. Crazy or not Sams still alluring to the movies two women both of whom are lit to look as if they were dipped in Vaseline. Theres his sultry mechanic girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox) who is first seen straddling a motorcycle like a garage-wall pin-up girl and a blond college seductress (Isabel Lucas) with some surprising anatomical features. As LaBeouf has accurately said at a recent premiere the movie is ""about big explosions beautiful women fast cars and insanity."" The ""insanity"" part is whats most striking as the movie occasionally feels like an attempt to simulate a manic paranoid altered state. There are conspiracies within conspiracies. The script cobbled together by Star Trek writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman (along with Ehren Kruger) involves a lot of globe-hopping (New York New Jersey Washington Shanghai Paris Egypt Jordan the Indian Ocean) in an ancient-treasure-hunt plot derived from Raiders of the Lost Ark . True there are token touches of would-be humour including a jive-talking black-sounding robot and some comic scenes with Sams terrified nerdy roommate Leo ( The Wire s Ramon Rodriguez) and returning from the first film John Turturro as a good-hearted wacko former CIA agent. Fox also adds the occasional sexy image to the montage of carnage turning to show her tightly clad derriere running in a flesh-coloured top and typically keeping her lips perpetually parted. Of course nobody goes to a Transformers movie for the jokes or the love interest - you go to see big robots and to watch stuff get blown up - but without dynamic contrasts even the destruction of internationally famous landmarks begins to feel like staring at wallpaper after a couple of hours. Because Bay bombards you with so much its easy to forget that he can be a gifted technician. Theres a scene for example when an animal-like Decepticon disgorges ball bearings into a rooftop steam pipe and a moment later the steel balls spread out inside the building before transforming into geometric figures and then a full robot. Taken on its own this is a masterful little slice of computer-generated animation but it gets lost here in the visual racket.

The film stars Megan Fox Shia LaBeouf and Josh Duhamel. It is once again directed by Michael Bay. You never go broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public -- or so say those who try to explain why director Michael Bay is a multimillionaire. Transformers Revenge of the Fallen (PG-13) Paramount (147 min.) Directed by Michael Bay. With Shia LaBeouf Megan Fox. Now playing in New Jersey. Stephen Whittys Rating ONE AND A HALF STARS Ratings Note The film contains sexual situations strong language and violence ""Bad Boys."" ""The Rock."" ""Armageddon."" ""Pearl Harbor."" These are not movies to gladden the heart of anyone except sugar-crazed action addicts with a taste for things blowing up. Unfortunately there are a lot of those in our nations megaplexes. In fact there are millions. Like an alchemist taking a dare """" can you take the most worthless junk and turn it into gold? """" Bay had his biggest hit two years ago with ""Transformers"" a movie based on a line of toys. And now its back. Duck There is clearly an audience for this kind of film although I suspect most of it is still in grammar school. My son graduates 5th grade today and his ""Transformers"" focus has changed right along with him """" where once he was mostly interested in the giant robots now hes mostly interested in Megan Fox. Our review of the first ""Transformers"" film Both appetites I have to admit are satisfied in the new sequel ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen."" The good robots (""Autobots"" for the uninitiated) and the bad ones (""Decepticons"") are fighting again but theres a new twist ""the Fallen"" a Lucifer-like creature (I love it when movies based on Hasbro toys get all theological) that wants to make a comeback. Paramount/DreamWorksMegan Fox and Shia LaBeouf run for their lives in Michael Bays ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen."" Naturally the best of the good robots """" Optimus Prime """" is determined to stop this. So are his human friends played by Shia LeBeouf and Megan Fox. Can they thwart this diabolical menace? Can you thwart a migraine for two-and-a-half hours? I wouldnt bet money on the latter. The movie is loud crude and blissfully even exultantly stupid with lots of elbow-in-the-ribs jokes about human groins and horny dogs but not even a flash of style. Odd flashes of offensiveness though. For a man who owes his career to Martin Lawrence Will Smith and ""Bad Boys"" youd think Bay wouldnt try to get most of his jokes out of a pair of ignorant jive-talking gold-toothed robots (voiced by the way by a white actor). But he does. And then gets the rest of his laughs out of juvenile ideas like having another robot talk like Joe Pesci or one rasp out tired macho lines like ""You wanna piece of me?"" Then when the laughter peters out he just has Megan Fox put on a low-cut top and run toward the camera again. In slow-motion. And Megan honey can you bend over when you do that? Beautiful Its all pretty numbing. Sitting there I could only wonder. Does John Turturro truly have no shame or did he think we actually wanted to see him in a thong? These are not questions I enjoy asking. But then over 144 minutes I had a lot of time to ask them. I realize of course that I am not the target audience. And fans who fall on the pre-puberty side of the ""Transformers"" divide might enjoy seeing the giant robots. Fans who fall on the other will enjoy seeing Fox whose eyelashes never lose their curl even in the Egyptian desert. But for the rest of us the most horrifying moment comes at the end when a Decepticon looks at the camera and intones ""This isnt over."" I was afraid of that.

Giger -- floats around in space where it sends a ball of fire rocketing to Earth. The asteroid-like object hits the ocean where it emerges as a prancing metallic cougar which then vomits out a mass of ball bearings which somehow assemble themselves into a super-thin droid thats like a Calder sculpture made entirely of jackknives. And its this dude who gets down to business attempting to steal the shard that will animate the dormant Decepticons hidden on Earth. The sheer velocity of all this shape-shifting is dizzying and funny and zigzag cool. The sequence serves no real purpose beyond dazzle for dazzles sake but when youre watching it thats purpose enough. Revenge of the Fallen has a number of dead spots but every time the movie hits one you can sit back in eager childish anticipation of the next feat of industrial whirligig diversion. When I was growing up no movie could take me out of this world quite like a giant-monster movie. Them and The Beast From 20000 Fathoms Godzilla and his Japanese rubber-gigantor brethren Even flickering from the confines of a small-screen TV these creature features delivered a blast of apocalyptic awe that made their utter ricketiness as movies forgivable at times endearing. I got a twinge of nostalgia for those days watching Revenge of the Fallen in which the Decepticons resume their war against the Autobots those friendly converted vehicles who wear their machine guts on the outside. The movie is sort of like the super-size metal-on-metal version of an old nuclear-mutant monster battle. Directed by Michael Bay and co-executive produced by Steven Spielberg Revenge of the Fallen is slovenly bombastic overly busy and -- at two hours and 29 minutes -- far too long. The plot which sends Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) to his freshman year at a debauched East Coast college and then to the ruins of Egypt suggests an awkward smelting of Bret Easton Ellis and Indiana Jones; it offers more frantic incident than it does purpose or sense. Yet each time the film reaches another clash of the titans it becomes more than just a souped-up toy commercial. These toys have wizardry and grandeur. And in the case of Optimus Prime the noble Autobot who converts into his nuts-and-bolts self out of a truck with a nifty orange-flame insignia they also have a glimmer of soul. Shia LaBeouf seems to get taller and leaner more confidently chiseled with each new movie. But hell always have his precocious kids quick-start mind and in Revenge of the Fallen he uses it to play off on-screen girlfriend Megan Fox with her porno-doll sultriness as if they were in a romantic comedy. Shes like Angelina Jolie before Jolie got too serious to be irresponsibly sexy and Revenge of the Fallen needs their jovial flirtatious chemistry; the movie would be too much of a juvenile boys bash without it. At college Sam having touched one of those otherworldly shards finds himself possessed by a series of ancient symbols and though this development is just a thin rehash of Richard Dreyfuss possession in Close Encounters of the Third Kind LaBeouf talking a mile a minute does something witty He literally makes you feel that his brain is working too fast for his mouth. I liked the hurtling speed of these scenes -- Ramon Rodriguez from The Wire brings his own motormouth brio to the role of Sams master-of-the-Internet roommate -- but Bay unfortunately cant sustain it. Whenever the U.S. military comes into the picture the movie stiffens and lumbers and the return of John Turturro as Sector 7 Agent Simmons is one babbling pop-eyed tech freak too many. At last years Comic-Con convention several representatives of Revenge of the Fallen appeared with the slogan ""Bigger. F--ing. Robots."" on their T-shirts and Bay taking that cue knows just what his job is relative to the first Transformers (2007) Its to make the movie huger louder smashier and -- on the mechanical level -- more crazily audaciously imaginative. He succeeds. Revenge of the Fallen showcases an infectiously diverse brigade of chattery unfolding contraptions from mechanical gremlins that transform out of kitchen appliances to one that erupts from a vintage airplane to a coed with a tongue of steel. Each of these creature-gizmos has a marvelous organic fluidity -- they dont just move they clank and roll. And it was an inspired touch to set the films most ferocious battle amid the Pyramids featuring a Decepticon so humungous it just about waddles with power. Revenge of the Fallen may be a massive overdose of popcorn greased with motor oil. But it knows how to feed your inner 10-year-olds appetite for destruction.

Autobots and Decepticons those heavy metal angels and demons duel to the death in Shanghai Washington and Paris.Well not always Paris. Philadelphias City Hall courtyard doubles for a beaux arts cafe in the City of Light and Eastern State Penitentiary serves as the heros hideaway.In fairness the movies first hour is pretty zippy as Sam Witwicky (charismatic Shia LaBeouf) heads East to college leaving behind parents girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox) and car (Bumblebee an Autobot-embedded 1977 Camaro). To Decepticons carefully tracking his every move Sam is a marked man. Hes got what they want so they can destroy the sun - and humanity.For those not current on the lore behind Transformers which began their lives as Hasbro toys Though Sam may look like just an everyboy to the metal behemoths he holds the key of life. He possesses a sliver of the cosmic sparkplug that is a life force both to the benevolent Autobots and dastardly Decepticons. We are told in the prologue that the adversaries have fought on Earth since paleolithic times.Unlike the first film Bays heavygoing sequel does not strike a balance between tech-loving humans and the anthropomorphic machines. Its diverting enough when envisioning a fanboy fantasyland considerably less so when it stages World War III. (The warriors are Autobots allied with U.S. soldiers fighting Decepticons.)The fantasyland moments take place in the Witwicky family kitchen where household appliances reveal themselves as pesky Decepticons; at Sams Ivy League campus where coeds look like Maxim Hot 100 girls; and on the open highway where sarcastic Sam and saucy Mikaela speed away in Bumblebee with Decepticons on their tail.(Considerably less entertaining is a sequence in which Sam has involuntary surgery a procedure that might be called a colonoscopy of the brain.)Roughly an hour in Transformers 2 morphs from teen adventure into lumbering war movie. Bay and his screenwriters squander their human capital in order to show us scenes of 20-ton toys crushing 10-ton toys.For one without an emotional stake in the Autobot Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) or the Decepticon Megatron (Hugo Weaving) their alien blood feud has the fascination of a tempest in a steel compactor.Periodically LaBeouf performs one of his funny motormouth rants or Fox slinks across a scene and the film becomes watchable.Mostly though Bay busily plays one-up with other action franchises. An image of a Decepticon clinging to the Empire State Building spire looks vaguely King Kong. The design of a quick-running Decepticon is faintly Jurassic Park-ish.Bay has a confounding sense of continuity letting Sam leave Washingtons Air and Space Museum and be surrounded by mountain ranges. Fortunately this metal mess is enlivened by John Turturro who shows up and injects the surprisingly raunchy film with a raunchily funny line or two.Transformers 2 is bigger longer and louder than its predecessor. In this case more is less.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com. Read her blog ""Flickgrrl"" at http//www.philly.com/philly/blogs/flickgrrl.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet In some future film class Michael Bays second Transformers film will no doubt be presented as the Platonic ideal of sequels. Everything about it is taken directly from the first movie but blown up bigger and louder. The scripts basic beats are identical massive opening action sequence; lengthy period of terrible Shia LaBeouf comedy; an extensive McGuffin hunt. The primary differences are that the new films explosions are bigger and eventually Bays major directorial weaknesses work to his advantage. Transformers Revenge Of The Fallens one new idea is placed in the mouth of a bespectacled ninny then immediately dismissed The giant sentient alien robots known as Decepticons are still infiltrating earth and their enemies the Autobots are working with the American military to find and destroy them. But the collateral damage is vast and an angry Washington flunky suggests to Autobot leader Optimus Prime that the Decepticons are only lingering to carry on the war and humans are paying the price. Briefly it seems like introspection and moral decisions might enter the picture. But the ninny is wrong; the Decepticons really want a bunch of ancient intel thats accidentally wound up trapped in LaBeoufs head causing him to act more embarrassingly spastic than ever. For far too long the movie consists of chase scenes scrotum jokes shrieked conversations broad slapstick and depressingly regressive ethnic caricatures. A good deal of time is also wasted on LaBeouf and dream-girl Megan Fox dickering over when hell finally say ""I love you."" Which is an odd choice for a film otherwise once again pitched at 13-year-old boys to whom fart jokes are always funny all women below the age of 40 are apparently plasticine porn stars and nothings cool unless it blows up--or better yet in an unfortunate running gag humps something else and then blows up. At least in the last half-hour Bays incredibly sloppy continuity and overeager rush to action pays off as he forgets the comic-relief characters whisks past the story elements and just gets down to a massive eye-popping combat sequence that blows up everything in sight. Which is probably all anyone really wanted from Michael Bays Transformers in the first place. So why did it take nearly five hours of movie to get there?

"Transformers Revenge of the Fallen A robot rumpus | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsTransformers Revenge of the Fallen A robot rumpusBefore getting into the booms and boobage of director Michael Bays latest sensory assault lets note that the man has no use for 3-D.Optimus Prime and Ironhide in a scene from the Transformers sequel.  (PHOTO COURTESY OF PARAMOUNT PICTURES)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticTues. June 23 2009 Transformers Revenge of the Fallen (out of 4)Starring Shia LaBeouf Megan Fox and John Turturro. Directed by Michael Bay. At major theatres. PG Before getting into the booms and boobage of director Michael Bays latest sensory assault lets note that the man has no use for 3-D. He considers it ""a gimmick"" and with Transformers Revenge of the Fallen he makes a solid argument that eyes can be popped eardrums shattered and hormones set ablaze without goofy glasses.This second chapter of the shape-shifting Transformers saga arriving in theatres at midnight tonight once again turns boys toys into movie behemoths. It delivers full-bore ""Bayhem"" like a brick to the forehead with some tender love on the side making this either the summers biggest blockbuster or historys loudest romance. The lack of a third dimension might actually be a public service since watching this movie is akin to lying on the tarmac at Pearson International while a revving Airbus A380 rolls over you. A decoder wheel might have been helpful however since - brace yourself - there are almost too many characters and too much plot in this film. The relatively modest (by Bay standards) battle of the first Transformers has been expanded into an all-out robot rumpus with many more locations and a cast of clankers that will likely befuddle anyone who doesnt have a propeller attached to his beanie.The head of the good alien Autobots is still Optimus Prime the 18-wheeler with a major Christ complex but hes sidelined for much of the movie by a wrong-headed U.S. national security drone (John Benjamin Hickey) who represents Obama but acts like Bush.Optimus is still trying to convince his erstwhile earthling pal Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) to assist him in saving the universe but Sam has other things on his mind hes heading East to attend college and hes trying to get up the nerve to tell his girlfriend Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox) that he loves her. The amply endowed Fox does a lot of leaning forward and pouting.Sam again gets dragged into the ongoing alien feud when a stray piece of the all-powerful AllSpark the Transformers power source ends up in his college rucksack. There are three major bad alien robots this time the revived Megatron (cmon you didnt really think he was gone did you?) his Decepticon leadership rival Starscream and a devilish bucket of bolts named the Fallen who is the boss of both. Not happy just to destroy Earth the Fallen is also plotting to blot out the sun too apparently in payback for something the cavemen did to him. The bad bots also have a host of mechanical insects and beasties at their beck and call including a panther that looks like it snacks on pit bulls.There are multitudinous Autobot additions too most of them played for comic relief. The most bizarre are The Twins a pair of over-excited Chevys that sound like theyve listened to too many rap videos.The comedy is what keeps Transformers 2 from turning into one colossal pileup of the monster trucks. Whether its Sams parents (Kevin Dunn and Julie White) fretting about their rose bushes and their Paris vacation in the midst of global calamity or his paranoid college roommate (Ramon Rodriguez) reluctantly tagging along for the ride the biological factor helps keep all the metal from melting down.Best of all in the laughs department is John Turturro whose Seymour Simmons was the bureaucratic troublemaker in the first film but who wears two caps this time jester and hero.Theres a lamentable amount of flannel in the film which needlessly runs close to 2 1/2 hours but people who love bent metal toys and noise will get all they crave.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

(AP Photo/Paramount Pictures Jaimie Trueblood)  NO SALES  << 1 of 1 images >> Related Media A joyless cacophony an insistent and seemingly endless onslaught ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen"" director Michael Bays follow-up to the 2007 smash ""Transformers"" plays more like a parody of a Bay movie.You name it it gets shot up blown up or otherwise obliterated in a massive fiery ball from suburban homes and cars to aircraft carriers and even an Egyptian pyramid. Along the way our sense of sanity and humanity also get destroyed as we feel as if we are being held captive by these walking talking shape-shifting robots - both the good guys and the bad.The Autobots and Decepticons arent the only ones assaulting us in their epic battle Regular people are just as obnoxious - probably more so - with their nonstop yelling and yammering. Everyone is overcaffeinated everyone screams their lines perhaps so they can hear each other over the explosions and the thunderous score.Who knows and more importantly who cares? It is impossible to become emotionally invested in the Transformers cool-looking as they may be when the movie settles down for a rare moment (the work of the venerable Industrial Light amp; Magic) because its impossible to tell whos doing what to whom. Its all one messy amalgamation of twisted steel and shattered glass accompanied by generic crunching and shrieking sounds. The only robots with any discernible personality traits aside from bravery or antagonism are the Autobot twins Mudflap and Skids. These are shockingly crass and unfortunate black stereotypes jive-talking fools who cant read and bumble their way from one mishap to the next. They are Jar Jar Binks in car form.After only an hour it all feels boring and numbingly repetitive and one glance and the watch tells you youve got another solid hour and a half to go.Whats that you say? You want to know what the ""Transformers"" sequel is about? How quaint. Basically it follows the further adventures of plucky young Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf seriously straining his likability) who is yet again stuck in the middle of the eternal fight between the noble Autobots and the evil Decepticons.The mythology is much more dense than that though as we learn from several self-serious expository speeches delivered by Autobot leader Optimus Prime (voiced as always by Peter Cullen) Decepticon leader Megatron (Hugo Weaving) - oh yes hes back - and the elderly Brit Jetfire (Mark Ryan). Something about millennia of history and oppression and capturing the energy of the sun. (Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman returned to write the script along with Ehren Kruger inspired by the Hasbro Transformer toys and the animated 80s TV show.)Megan Fox is also back as Sams impossibly hot girlfriend Mikaela with whom he hopes to maintain a long-distance relationship as he heads off to college. (The first time we see her its from behind in a pair a Daisy Duke shorts as shes bent over a motorcycle seat; this and running across the desert while maintaining perfect lip gloss are all shes asked to do.) Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson also provide eye candy as commanders of a secret team that works alongside the Autobots to hunt down any remaining Decepticons; this requires them to look hot in camouflage as they squint pensively into the sunset.Laughs are unusual in this brawny endeavor but if anyone gets them its John Turturro as a former secret agent who gets hauled back into the fray. Youll feel as if youve been dragged in too.""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen"" a DreamWorks and Paramount Pictures release is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi action violence language some crude and sexual material and brief drug material. Running time 150 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.

(Paramount Pictures) Joe Neumaier Monday June 22 2009 1022 PM Title Transformers Revenge of the Fallen ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen"" - the biggest most smashmouth movie of the summer - has arrived and trying to avoid it will be like getting out of the way of a 20-robot-car pileup.With wild anticipation waiting for it ""Trans 2"" its blood a mixture of Red Bull and diesel fuel is set to be 2009s box-office steamroller. But though it has plenty of popcorn moments that can be big dumb fun (alien secrets under a pyramid sexy girls who sprout mechanical tails at the worst moments) director Michael Bays sequel is louder and more illogical than the megasuccessful 2007 original.Still when watching moving construction sites go to battle is what you crave this is the film to go to.Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) heading to college has to leave hot girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox) and bot guardian Bumblebee at home. Yet Sams higher learning is jump-started when he gets a cryptic message imprinted into his brain thanks to the AllSpark the cubic doohickey with the insurance-company name that serves as life force for both the heroic Autobots and evil Decepticons.Sams alien mindscan proves handy when bad bot Megatron returns chats with the Emperor-like robot of his home planet then goes after Sam his parents (Kevin Dunn and Julie White) and valiant Autobot Optimus Prime. To assure Decepticon victory Megatron needs a vaporizer hidden in Egypt that will destroy the sun - and humanity once and for all. ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen"" is action-packed. (Trueblood/AP) Since Bay clearly knows the story isnt the selling point youd think hed cut the exposition and jabbering that stretches the flick to a bruising two and a half hours. Nope - and minor characters from the first film are all back as if we were waiting to see how military men Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson and science geek John Turturro had aged.Hey Michael Its the robots stupid. Despite all the mechanical mayhem none of the Transformers stand out. One sounds like Steve Buscemi two others are offensive Amos n Andy-style carbots and one villain named Jetfire has to be IDd with a subtitle before one of the films still-cool-looking machine-to-monster transformations. (That whimpering you hear are the outclassed cyborgs from ""Terminator Salvation."")And while LaBeouf proves finally to be a viable leading man and Fox and her midriff earn the power-rock ballads that play every time they have a close-up they ought to move aside sometimes. We shouldnt have to crane our necks to see the clanky cool stuff. Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Not to mention ADD -- this bloated movie is probably the first to require a dose of Ritalin to get through all 2 1/2 hours. ""Transformers ROTF"" consists largely of stuff being blown up except on the frequent occasions when the camera pauses to admire the physiognomy of Megan Fox. PHOTOS Transformers Red Carpet PHOTOS Most Expensive Movies MOVIE BLOG Bay Watch Those targeted boys and overgrown boys are more than welcome to add up to 2.5 stars to my rating and head for the nearest theater for tonights midnight show -- although if you see it in IMAX please be careful to avoid the new Digital IMAX with much smaller screens. For the rest of you I wish I could explain the plot which Hollywood antichrist Michael Bay has rendered without such niceties as coherence. All I can say for sure is that nerdy Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) has gone off to college leaving behind his super-hot girlfriend Mikaela (Ms. Fox). While he is French-kissing another hottie (Isabel Lucas) with uh issues and his mother is sampling a marijuana brownie on a campus filled with wacky characters all hell is breaking loose with the alien robots. The evil Decepticons are laying waste to Shanghai Paris New York and what looks suspiciously like the backlot at Universal Pictures. This being a Michael Bay movie lots of stuff gets blown up. Bridges. Buildings. Aircraft carriers. Airplanes. Helicopters. The Smithsonians Air and Space Museun which suffered quite enough in ""Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian."" And of course lots and lots of vehicles. By the time the Decepticons go to work on demolishing the Pyramids we learn from a newscast that ""President Obama is in a bunker at an unknown location."" Sam spends a lot of time spouting pseudoscientific mumbo-jumbo about stuff in his head. He sets about using this stuff to rescue Optimus Prime the head good-guy robot so Optimus can save humanity. And be available for a second sequel no doubt. Along the way Bay throws in everything including I think the kitchen sink beginning with a prologue set in 20000 B.C. and ending with the silliest climax in recent sci-fi/fantasy history. Im not giving it away but believe me its quite a dubious achievement. LaBeouf who was in a serious automobile accident during production understandably seems a bit less spontaneous than in the first film. Fox is well decorative. What acting honors there are go to John Turturro who was merely annoying the first time around but is actually somewhat funny as an obsessive former CIA agent who is now running a deli in Brooklyn. There are a great many other actors and robots running around in this production -- which reportedly cost a quarter of a billion dollars -- but Ill be damned if I can sort them out. ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen"" dazzles the eye numbs the mind and may cause deafness in some cases.

ABOUT THE MOVIETransformers 2 Revenge of the Fallen 1/2 (out of four)Stars Shia LaBeouf Megan Fox John Turturro Josh Duhamel|Director Michael BayDistributor Paramount PicturesRating PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi action violence language some crude and sexual material and brief drug materialRunning time 2 hours and 20 minutesOpens Tuesday night in select theaters and Wednesday nationwide  WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Transformers 2 Revenge of the Fallen is proof positive that not every summer action blockbuster has the mettle to be a franchise. This sequel to the clever and funny first Transformers not only is disappointing it will give most people a throbbing case of metal overload. Bigger louder longer and more metallic is definitely not better. Where the first movie was a happy surprise a comedy with engaging characters and spectacular action-filled escapades the sequel lacks wit charm subtlety restraint humanity and clever dialogue. It has loads of spectacle but no soul. The Autobots and their nemeses the Decepticons are far more plentiful this time. Global destruction is seemingly at hand. But the overbearing story and its nearly 21/2-hour running time numbs the audience into submission. Though there are more special effects and new ways for machines to turn into bots the story seems as if its about to end at least three times. If only. Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky has flashes of the engaging persona that enlivened the first movie but hes no longer an unlikely action hero. He and his girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox) play bravely bland resourceful teens in a familiar story of good machines vs. bad machines fighting for world domination. Fox does little but run around and look blankly pretty. Favorite Transformers are back including Bumblebee the yellow Camaro Autobot and Optimus Prime the noble leader of the Autobots. But there are hordes of far less distinctive machines -- so many that its tough to tell the heroes from the villains. Sam has just started college. His roommate the computer-savvy Leo (Ramon Rodriguez) joins in against the robotic mayhem. Sam touches the Allspark cube an alien energy source and information is implanted in his brain. This unexpected study guide proves more useful than the best tutor. Meanwhile pyramids are dismantled bodies hurled through the air and facial orifices probed. And all the metal on display is more brassy than precious. No amount of technical virtuosity can make up for an agonizingly witless story clumsy dialogue and uninteresting characters.

"Transformers Revenge of the Fallen | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; transformers-revenge-of-the-fallen ) Transformers Revenge of the Fallen (United States 2009) June 23 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Call me old fashioned but I like a little side story and character to go along with my order of big loud special effects. Apparently Im in the minority though because the original Transformers made more money than Id see in 300 lifetimes. So kick back dig into your jumbo faux butter-drenched popcorn and slurp your gargantuan soda while experiencing the kind of supersized mayhem that only Michael Bay can deliver. Its a question of whether the cholesterol in the ""butter"" will harden your arteries before whats on the celluloid can cause brain death. The robots are all back Optimus Prime Megatron Bumblebee Megan Fox. Transformers Revenge of the Fallen takes one part inspiration from the Godzilla movies one part inspiration from Star Wars and one part inspiration from all the commas in the number associated with the budget. In a nutshell my problems with the second Transformers are largely the same ones I had with the 2007 edition the story doesnt make any sense the characters are annoying the action is dull and repetitive and during machine-on-machine throwdowns its impossible to figure out who the good guys are. The biggest difference 15 more minutes. Talk about self-indulgent. This movie would be too long at 1.5 hours. It never wants to end. Forget merely wandering out to the concession stand in the middle of the proceedings to refill that oil drum-sized bucket of popcorn. You can get in your car drive to the nearest supermarket do your weeks shopping and return and youll be no less confused than those who stayed for the whole thing. Sad but true. Going into detail about the plot will make me sound like Im recapping the backstory for a childrens coloring book but here are the basics. It seems that around 17000 B.C. (early enough that it predates last years Roland Emmerich prehistoric disaster) the Transformers came to Earth for the first time. There was some kind of big war and a giant weapon and the key to use it were hidden. Cut to today. There are more Decepticons (bad guys) headed for Earth led by The Fallen (voice of Tony Todd). He has sent his minions ahead to resurrect Megatron (voice of Hugo Weaving) and kill Optimus Prime (voice of Peter Cullen). Once those things are accomplished he can invade get the key and the weapon and destroy Earths sun. Unfortunately in his way stands a puny human named Sam (Shia LeBeouf) and his gorgeous android-like girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox). Having accidentally taken home a shard of the Allspark doesnt dissuade Sam from attending the University of Pennsylvania so thats where he is when Megatrons underlings find him. Much chaos ensues. There is a famous term in theater and film called ""deus ex machina."" It means literally ""God by machine"" and is frequently used to describe an event when unbelievable coincidences or contrivances are needed to move the plot in a certain direction. Transformers Revenge of the Fallen takes this term to heart. There is a scene late in the movie when we come face to face with machine gods who tweak events so everything will turn out right. Theres a temptation to argue that with something this blunt it has to be satire. Unfortunately Michael Bay has not built his reputation upon sophisticated satire and he doesnt seem to be winking at the audience. The ""action"" is relentless in its monotony. Robots pounding on robots. Humans launching rockets and missiles at robots. Robots wiping out troops of humans. Other robots destroying the great pyramids or climbing to the top of the Empire State Building and aping King Kong. Theres some unpleasantness in Paris as well. For a moment I want to say the Eiffel Tower is destroyed but that doesnt occur here; its in the preview for G.I. Joe which was shown just before Transformers 2. See how all these films run together? At any rate this stuff goes on and on and on far beyond whats necessary for a brain dead motion picture that has nothing to recommend it except its technical prowess. We certainly get the point before the 150-minute mark. Shia LeBeouf is back injured hand and all bravely trying to bring some humanity to a role that requires little except that he not stumble over dialogue that could have been written by a sixth-grader. Megan Fox returns as eye candy. Theres no point to her being in the movie except that well shes hot. But as they say its not the heat its the humidity. Ramon Rodriguez plays Leo Sams Penn dorm mate. Hes half the comedy relief. The other half is John Turturro reprising his role from the first film although this time hes not an annoying government agent - he has joined the good guys. Someone else is brought in to fill that role of designated asshole. As was true in the first film the Transformers are more colorful than the humans. A fan of the toys could probably catalog whats what and whats missing but they all look pretty much the same to me and the only way to tell the Decepticons from the Autobots is that the former have red eyes while the latter have blue eyes. Pretty tough to differentiate in the heat of battle with a shaky cam. The most touching relationship in the film to the extent that anything can be considered ""touching"" is the one between Sam and his car. Its more heartfelt than the relationship between Sam and his girlfriend who exhibits less personality than the car. Now is probably not the time to heap scorn on the writing team of Orci and Kurtzman (abetted by Ehren Kruger) who are responsible for this screenplay. At the moment the pair are enjoying praise for their Star Trek reboot. Lets be honest though - thats not exactly an airtight story but compared to this one its a masterpiece of coherence and ingenuity. Pundits have pointed out similarities in Star Trek to Star Wars but theyre even more obvious here with Megatron playing Darth Vader to The Fallens Emperor. And Orci and Kurtzman out-menace The Phantom Menace by providing not one but two imitation Jar Jar Binks. In the long run this review will be worth even less than what John Nance Garner called the Vice Presidency of the United States. Transformers fans salivating for two years awaiting this sequel will queue up to see it then leave the theater and get back in line again. The storyline is so infantile that it will appeal to young kids (or at least to those with XY sex chromosomes) although one has to wonder whether the length will be something of an impediment. The target viewer for this movie is not noted for a long attention span. Transformers Revenge of the Fallen will make a ton of money Michael Bay will be lauded as the greatest director of our generation and the accountants at Paramount will have their second collective orgasm in as many months. As for me I will try desperately not to weep - not so much for what the success of a movie like this means to motion pictures but for the simple fact that Im going to have to do this all over again in two or three years for Transformers 3.

"Transformers suffer metal fatigue - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Robots Transformers suffer metal fatigueMovie reviewJune 24 2009|By Roger Moore Sentinel movie criticAs big dumb summer ""entertainments"" go they dont get much bigger or much dumber than Transformers Revenge of the Fallen. The briefly amusing mash-up/crunch-up of a couple of summers back has been recycled into an epic two and a half hours of explosions ponderous cartoon history veiled racism and inept geography.Is it the worst movie of the summer? Possibly. Will everybody see it? Probably.Revenge of the Fallen promises more Optimus vs. Megatron more Ford vs. Chevy (Only Ford is AWOL. They didnt want to play the bad-guy cars this time.) more Shia vs. Megan Foxs cut-off short-shorts.That last one by the way -- no contest.Revenge of the Fallen means that the robots that supposedly were terminated in Transformers have gotten back their ""spark"" led by ""The Fallen"" (voiced by Tony Todd of Candyman). They have big plans for this planet that they first discovered thousands of years ago. Its up to Optimus Prime (Peter Cullens voice) the Autobots and their human (American) allies to stop them.Only the government doesnt trust our beloved Camaros that convert into killer robots. Theyre convinced the bots are the magnet that draws the evil Decepticons to Earth for their little brawls. The military men just shake their heads at this civilian foolishness.""Weve shed blood sweat and precious metals together""Meanwhile the idiotically named Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf not touching that one) is off to college where hes pursued by alien co-eds and rescued by the comically hot Mikaela (Ms. Fox). Sam is connected to these transforming beasties by his past and an imprint on his brain.As with the last Transformers movie the early scenes work best. LaBeouf does a great motor-mouthed patter as Sam hallucinates visions of alien hieroglyphics and maps annoying his astronomy professor (Rainn Wilson funny in his one scene) and frightening his player/entrepreneur roomie (Ramon Rodriguez). At some point though the funny patter and goofy-mom (Julie White fearlessly foolish) moments end and its all about the metal on metal as we circle the globe sink an aircraft carrier and trash a pyramid or two in an effort to fend off human extinction.Director Michael Bay decided he liked the laughs of the first 40 minutes of the first Transformers movie so he pushed more laughs into this one -- parents eating hash brownie jokes robots humping Megan Foxs leg jokes robots trash talking cursing and generally acting very street. Two of them have gold teeth profess to be illiterate and speak a version of ""jive"" that must date back to Starsky amp; Hutch. Bay came all the way to America from Britain built a career on Bad Boys movies just to put robots in blackface?But heres where 2.0 is better than the original. The GM cars are cooler. The effects are sharper higher-definition. None of that blur of chrome and steel that made the first films fights so tedious. Bay trots out every bit of U.S. military ordnance he can get his hands on -- Predators B-1 bombers. The guy who gave us Pearl Harbor has always wanted to be the new Tony Scott and with Transformers -- which was sort of Top Gun for toddlers during its 80s TV cartoon days -- he gets his wish.The banter of the early scenes the slang-savvy rap that LaBeouf and Rodriguez share about ""Pretty Bettys"" (the opposite of Ugly Betty) the way Fox embraces being exploited for her sensuality that is abandoned for hours of chases and explosions.Bay couldnt bear to edit out a single effect or explosion. Even the third-act return of an over-the-top John Turturro as a disgraced government agent looking for redemption cant help The Fallen get up.See for yourselfTransformers Revenge of the Fallen####Cast Shia LaBeouf Megan Fox John Turturro Rainn WilsonDirector Michael BayRunning time 2 hours 31 minutesIndustry rating PG-13 for sequences of intense sci-fi action violence language some crude and sexual material and brief drug material.

Transformers Revenge of the Fallen Director Michael Bay. Cast Shia LaBeouf Megan Fox John Turturro. Rating Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi action violence language some crude and sexual material and brief drug material. Great Good Fair Bad Bomb Related Movies transformed Tyrese Gibsons life Heroic Transformers sequel is a toy story too The making of Megan Foxs career Transformers blasts back Great moments in special effects Megan Foxs premiere looks What else were you expecting from ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen?"" If your answer includes a coherent story decent acting and direction conducted with anything more subtle than a sledgehammer - this is a Michael Bay film after all - then keep looking. But if you like special effects launched at you with relentless mind-numbing intensity at the expense of all else this is the film for you. As was the first which was an international blockbuster. Theres no reason to think the sequel wont be as well. Having survived the original Shia LaBeouf is back as Sam Witwicky now off to college preparing for a long-distance relationship with his girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox) of whom a Decepticon says ""Youre hot but you aint too bright"" which sizes things up pretty nicely. The Autobots have teamed up with humans to ferret out the last of the Decepticons on Earth - youre either into this kind of thing or youre not so adjust your capacity for sentences like that accordingly. Optimus Prime (voice of Peter Cullen) remains the Autobot leader but neither he nor his fellow Transformers are trusted by the White House here personified by liaison Galloway (John Benjamin Hickey sporting Donald Rumsfeld glasses) though Barack Obama is mentioned by name at least once. Sams college roommate Leo (Ramon Rodriguez) is a conspiracy nut about to get more than he bargained for. On the first night of school he takes Sam to a frat party where Sam is hit on by a Decepticon in disguise - hot-girl disguise. Sam it seems is seeing weird visions scribbling symbols and such. Eventually it all leads to a search involving something called the matrix of leadership and a key good guys and bad guys alike are after. Turns out the Fallen isnt just a title its a Decepticon (Tony Todd) bent on destroying Earth (long story; dont ask). Along the way John Turturro returns as Agent Simmons now working in his mothers deli for some welcome comic relief. There are enormous battle sequences - you can practically see the dollar signs - but little effort at telling a story. While the effects are monstrously impressive eventually they become something akin to beating a metal trash can with a baseball bat. Too loud and it wears you out. Plot devices shift as readily as the sands in which the climactic battle is fought. Truly for better or worse this isnt anything more than kids toys come to life. And if there were any doubt the ""In association with Hasbro"" title card at the beginning is there to remind you. Reach Goodykoontz at 602-444-8974 or bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

And while it would be hard to make a case for Revenge of the Fallen as good in any normal sense of the word it possesses such brute force that the viewer is left with two options surrender or suffer in silence. The first hour is essentially Maxim the Movie a parade of sweaty denim product placement and gadgets punctuated with eardrum-rupturing action and increasingly tiresome gags. The story is largely absent as Shia LaBeoufs Sam Witwicky heads to college only to find himself suffering spasmodic brain-scrambling visions which seem to have some connection to the ongoing Transformer war. Somehow a total absence of narrative logic doesnt feel like an insult to the viewers intelligence its not that the writers believe their audience are too stupid to notice the gaping holes in the plot; its just that they know they dont give a damn. And Bays direction offers sparks of genuine invention including a stunning break-in involving a metallic cougar and a herd of smart ball bearings. Then somewhere around the mid point it begins to come together. A smash-and-plunder forest battle ups the action ante and the return of John Turturro adds a lightness of tone which is totally lacking in LaBeouf and Megan Fox. Perhaps its just that the sheer volume and ferocity of the thing becomes impossible to resist but by the climactic desert conflict in which the entire Valley of the Kings is razed to the ground the film has become so utterly lunatic so breathtakingly boneheadedly brazen that its easier just to give in.

The CGI is amazing but there is so much of it and so many incredibly complex battle scenes - you just didnt need them all really. I also totally agree with the first critic - it is incredibly sexist and racist. I love action SciFi CGI packed films but I do like a believable rounded female character in there as well please. I watched the film with the DVD cometary and conclude the misoginy lies with the writers and director. Shame on you. Despite all this I did manage to enjoy it.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 27 2010rickyFeaturedmel is a tool \/.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 27 2010rickyFeaturedmel is a tool \/.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 5 2009MichealJacksonFeaturedSpectacular effectsespecially the fight at the end with the fallen and meggatron.

Megan Fox on that motorbike in the first scene you see her in you gotta love it. Some of the smaller robots are fantastic. Lots of action. Downers- insanely ludicrously unashamedly silly silly silly silly premise (I mean really its the most ridiculous premise of any franchise ever); over-the-top world-destroying scenario / America Saves The World (Again) In The Middle East [OMG shut up]; the ""old guy"" aeroplane transformer is just stupid (WHY the off-British accent?? This is an ALIEN for goodness sake). Not really a particularly ""intelligent"" or thought-provoking movie but it doesnt have to be. Not quite as good as Terminator Salvation but still in the 3-star band for my money.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 9 2009FreddyFeaturedIs this movie the greatest sequel ever made? Its definitely a contender. Im usually into art house or independent cinema but of course everyone kow tows to the power of America in cinema eventually. Its their art/entertainment form and the review is completely right - this movie boils hollywood cinema down to the basic components. In fact its almost revolutionary in its rewriting of hollywood conventions - nothing exists except entertainment - no character no story no unity of time or place the egyptian desert is seemingly everwhere in the world even the sea and a quarry; lebeouf appears to have broken his hand halfway through filming - no attempt is made to disguise this continuity error. Characters have no role and are played by people who cant act. It has no pretensions no message no morality and no death - despite its recycling of sacrifice and honour tropes. Its fucking madness explodes in your face and pisses on your puny middle class theorising of cinema and taste. Its confused me so much I will never be able to watch it again.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 9 2009FreddyFeaturedIs this movie the greatest sequel ever made? Its definitely a contender.

Much of this battle scene appears as if it was filmed during the first movie and simply left out. I see now why the South Park guys dislike Michael Bey so much. He doesnt make very good action movies. (Although I liked the Island for some reason). This movie may have well been a cartoon with the less than sophmorish plot and humor.

At our theater after you bought your ticket they had another sign inside by the actual theater that rated it an ""R"" for the sex and language. Totally NOT a kid flick. Saying f-ing and pussy etc. is NOT PG 13 language nor is a crotch shot of the cougar-bot chick. Oh and the mom getting stoned just wasnt needed. The 2 idiot robots ruined it for our kids....I mean come ON. Even our kids (11 and 13) thought it was too long and convoluted. Oh....and our kids kept asking what did Megan Fox do to her LIPS? They could TELL what shed done to her boobs. Too bad she is lovely and didnt need either of those features enhanced so to speak.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 28 2009FsmFeaturedDisney channel plot (going away to college bumbling parents OMG CO-ED DORM? nerds going to parties? shia le boeuf) made me cringe at moments.

It was so well done from everything from Shias witty comments to each of the robots having a wonderful personality to the ending with the epic battle for the cube. With that said Im slightly disappointed in this movie. I loved it but it could have been just as good as the first one. The plot was sketchy and didnt flow well Shia and Megan were both lacking in their formerly bubbly witty comments and character as well as a lack of character development for the res of the cast. The other transformers were also lacking in appearance and charater all together. One perk was to see Optimuss real potential. He truely shined and stood out from the rest of the Transformers. The sexual humor and cursing were used more than necessary though there were a handful of brilliant moments with these items. The SFX were still just as stunning as the first Im still slightly disappointed in this. I left me with a sort of empty feeling as if the movie didnt accomplish what it was meant to.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 28 2009J Autobot23FeaturedIn my opinion this sequal is like the dinner menu in your fav restaurant. Looks great in the menu but when they bring you the food u scratch your head and wonder why they brought you a totally different dish On top of that I made the mistake of bringing my kid and paying for 2 tickets just to hear a whole gob of things that any kid regardless of age should hear and scenes that had sexual content. THIS WAS SUPPOSE TO BE A COOL MOVIE FOR KIDS AND GR8 SPECIAL EFFECTS AND CAR ADS FOR PARENTS   FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 28 2009burningekoFeaturedthis film was awful. the worst part is that it could have been so much more. Who was Bays audience in this film? it had too much swearing and overt sexual humor for the kids and was just boring for anyone over 15. he could have really developed some of the characters but instead just plonked down a bunch of new ones with nothing more than a voice over for characterization. the humans that got screen time were bland and added nothing to the story unfortunately thats mostly what the screen time was devoted to. the only time i felt anything was when the mute bumblebee gave his sad look at the demise of another bot now if more emotion can be felt through a mute robot rather than a talking human you know you are doing something wrong. people who support this film tend to say ""what were you expecting? well what i was expecting was a transformers movie witty with a plot that made sense robots with personalities that i liked that kicked each others asses for good plot reasons not an advert for the army I rate the 80s cartoon film higher than this and frankly i think it will age better than this hunkajunk this film was racist sexist and stupid. this is the first time that i have heard a president named in a film which just shows how badly this will age (a contradiction was after the introduction it gives you a timeframe of present day what happens when another president gets elected?). bad script carbon characters boringFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 28 2009CMFeaturedI enjoyed the movie although I do think it could have done without the ""goofy"" looking twin bots and the dog humping. The CGI was awesome and having more of the transformer history explained by the movie was cool. My husband and I went to the movie to determine if our young son (who loves transformers) could come see it. The movie has too much cursing for us to let him watch it... too bad. It could have been a great movie without a few of the cude jokes cursing and dog humping.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 28 2009etnpnysFeaturedThis movie was amazing. Perhaps my expectations were low from hearing all the bad reviews... The plot was awesome - you can actually walk away from this movie understanding why ever single thing happened. Somebody said that the acting was bad - I cant think of a single actor that didnt nail the character perfectly. The special effects were obviously amazing - Michael Bay loves to make this kind of movie. The movie was hilarious as well - and those who say otherwise may not have ever seen any of the original CARTOONS. There was suspense comedy action a plot that you can follow without a masters degree and it was FUN.

I came to the theatre to see an epic action movie and what i got was almost an attempt at comedy. All the robots were cracking jokes whilst they fought the two ""black"" robots had comically dumb looking faces there were multiple dog-humping jokes other crude sex jokes and many other attempts at making it funny that i just that FAILED HORRIBLY. In addition to this as the movie is coming to its climax one of the main characters makes a joke about the bad transformers testicles. It really ruined the movie for me. Their attempts to create an action/comedy were terrible as i came to the theatre to see one of the most epic films of all time. Such a disappointment. On a lighter note the special effects were amazing. Thats the only thing that made the movie good.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 27 2009philFeaturedI had mixed feelings about this film. Firstly the cinema i went to was pretty much full and the air con wasnt turned on or it was broken so i found it hard at times to get into the film. There was times when i was wishing it would hurry up and get on with more of the amazing cgi and other times i was wishing that megan fox would be on the screen more. Is it better than the fist one hmmmm i would say no. The fight scenes are awsome but i feel that they should have done more of this as basically everyone wants rto see robots fighting and transforming. Who cares about story give me guns and explosions. I know all films need a story but whats wrong with the decepticons trying to kill humnas and the auto bots. Also i dont remeber any transformers taking the form of a human. Is this terminator????

With machines that are impressively more lifelike and characters that are more and more like machines ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen"" takes the franchise to a vastly superior level of artificial intelligence. As for human intelligence its primarily at the service of an enhanced arsenal of special effects which helmer Michael Bay deploys like a general launching his very own shock-and-awe campaign on the senses. Otherwise little seems new compared to the first installment except that this version is longer louder and perhaps ""more than your eye can meet"" in one sitting. It will reap similar B.O. rewards worldwide. Kicking off where the initial entry ended part two of an eventual trilogy continues to carry Hasbros toys and cartoons of the 80s to the heights of 21st-century CGI and moviemaking technology. Focusing even more on what auds seemed to appreciate last time around -- that is the stupefying sight of colossal alien robots morphing quite realistically into earthly contraptions and vice versa -- the plot serves as merely a pretext to showcase lots of well-designed creations which run the gamut from a remote-control toy car to an actual Stealth fighter. After a prologue set in 17000 B.C. we once again team up with U.S. Army grunts Capt. Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and Sgt. Epps (Tyrese Gibson) now members of an elite squad called NEST which uses humans and Autobots to hunt down rogue Decepticons across the globe. Hoping to free their leader Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving) who was previously imprisoned at the bottom of the ocean (why he wasnt melted down into scrap metal is a question only franchises can answer) the baddies are hoping to uncover the remaining shards of the powerful cube (""the Spark"") that was destroyed at the end of the first pic. As was the case before nerd-cum-hero/heartthrob Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) happens to hold the key to the Decepticons shot at world domination. Only this time hes left both his goofy parents (Kevin Dunn Julie White) and hot mechanic g.f. (Megan Fox) behind for a college whose students all look like twentysomething actors and whose frat parties seem to take place at expensive strip clubs. In fact on his first night out Sam is treated to a sort of lap dance by a Decepticon posing as a nymphomaniacal freshman -- one of several more overtly sexual nods in this episode (including a shot of John Turturro in a G-string). Cutting schematically between the militarys efforts to thwart the Decepticons and Sams prophesying tics (scribbling foreign symbols speaking in tongues) provoked by the Spark the opening hour culminates in a massive forest-set battle that leaves the Autobots leader Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) ripe for the junkyard. Like the other extensive combat scenes -- including a closing all-out war that appears to take place in the same desert location as in the first movie -- the sheer amount of ripping steel exploding mechanical parts and mutating vehicles of all shapes and sizes is something to behold. Industrial Light amp; Magics superb handling of these sequences which are like a little boys playtime fantasy taken to Wagnerian proportions are the veritable centerpieces of a narrative that makes little effort to set up the fights. The effects are captured in varying earth tones by d.p. Ben Seresin (""Best Laid Plans"") who does a terrific job matching the CG and live-action sequences while delving into Bays usual combo of a few slow-motion dramatic moments and lots of widescreen airborne pandemonium. Likewise a new team of editors pieces everything together seamlessly. A few surprises arrive in the second half -- involving bigger deadlier pieces of metal including a character the Fallen (Tony Todd) that gives the pic its title -- when the action heads to Egypt and Jordan. But returning scribes Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman -- joined this time by Ehren Kruger (""The Ring"" ""The Brothers Grimm"") -- seem to be mining conventional motifs from ""The Mummy"" and ""Indiana Jones"" series. Although the writers propose a similar dose of tongue-in-cheek dialogue for Sam his parents and his techie roommate (played by Ramon Rodriguez of ""The Wire"") the actors often have to shout it over constant music or thunderous bursts of crunching hardware. LaBeouf has a few strong moments during the college-set scenes and Turturro -- whose character has been demoted from a government agent to a butcher in a Brooklyn deli -- once again offers some much-needed zaniness in the heavy later stages. But the true stars here are the Transformers themselves who continually steal the spotlight from the flesh-and-blood cast even in scenes of tragic death or comic relief usually reserved for real actors. ""If God made us in his image then who made him?"" Sgt. Epps wonders early on gazing with awe at Optimus Prime. If such a question seems to be hinting at a veritable Autobot creation myth it may explain why humans here have become backseat drivers to these extremely cool cars.
