The instantly recognisable voice of German director Werner Herzog narrates David Attenborough-style as a colony of adorable penguins migrates across the snowy wastes of Antarctica. Herzog giggles like a blushing schoolgirl as the penguins fall on their chubby bum-bums - a very funny pisstake of the savage vision of nature in his own Antarctica doc Encounters at the End of the World.Film-loving parents thats your one lol. Everything else in this caper for kids is decent enough as a SWAT team of penguins - Skipper Kowalski Rico and Private - take on an octopus called Dave. Hes concocted a mwah-ha-ha plan to steal all the penguins in the world. Benedict Cumberbatch is the voice of a hoity-toity secret-agent wolf Classified. The film is frantic and silly and our biggest gripe is that all the penguins look the same.

They are also penguins turned stars having earned their own film on the strength of their cuteness quotient in previous installments of the ""Madagascar"" series. These penguins really are cute the animation is consistently appealing and the movie is obviously bound for megamoolah at the box office. Yet its worth noting another distinction of sorts. The story line a sequence of very loosely connected events sustains a state of almost pure brainlessness with its indifference to dramatic development...

I dimly recall the first installment in the franchise but if I ever saw either of the two sequels (to date) it left no meaningful imprint on my hippocampus. So I came to the first feature-film spinoff Penguins of Madagascar with an open mind. Seeing it with my children I was modestly diverted and they somewhat more so. This is a kids movie that is content to remain a kids movie in contrast to the somewhat grander aspirations of say Big Hero 6.The movies titular penguins (voiced by Tom McGrath Chris Miller Conrad Vernon and Christopher Knights) are a quartet of self-styled Mission Impossible-like agents who open the film by infiltrating Fort Knox on a whim. There however they meet the nemesis that they never knew they had an Octopus named Dave (John Malkovich) who occasionally passes for human under the alias Dr. Octavius Brine. (Yes its a stretch.) Maddened by the cuteness of penguins he hatches a plan to capture them from zoos all over the world and using his ""Medusa serum"" turn them into hideous monsters. Our feathered-and-flippered heroes try to put a stop to this infernal plot with the help of a secret interspecies strike force called The North Wind commanded by a gray wolf (Benedict Cumberbatch) so deep undercover that even his name is ""Classified.""Penguins of Madagascar is an amusing though lightweight romp featuring some nice vocal performances--in particular by Cumberbatch Malkovich and in a tiny but hilarious cameo Werner Herzog. And there are enough knowing gags scattered throughout the film (notably a series of puns on movie-star names) to keep grownups engaged.Related Story Charlie Brown Feel-Good Edition? Good Grief But Thanksgiving is a time for family and for shirking work and out of respect for both traditions--and in recognition that I am surely not in the movies demographic sweet spot--Im handing the heavy lifting over to my kids Tom (11) and Alexandra (9). Ive done this twice before with Ice Age Continental Drift and Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters and those who wish to track Tom and Alexs critical evolution are welcome to do so. Those on the other hand who are left cold by the whole ""I let my kids review the movie"" shtick should probably bail out now. [Ed note This conversation has been edited for clarity and to remove some instances of my children being all-too-obviously smarter than I am.]So guys who were your favorite characters in the movie?Tom I think Benedict Cumberbatch did a very good job as Classified. I also liked Short Fuse [voiced by Ken Jeong]. And I also liked Corporal [Peter Stormare] because hes like ""Youre so cute"" to all the penguins.You probably liked Benedict Cumberbatch in part because you like him in Sherlock right?Tom I still like him better as Sherlock but he did a very good job as Classified.How about you Alex who was your favorite character?Alex Well I have two favorite characters. One of my favorites was Classified because hes a wolf and wolves are my second-favorite animals.Whats your favorite animal?Alex My first-favorite animals are red pandas.Red pandas and then wolves?Alex Yeah and then foxes. [Ed note Alas there are no red pandas or foxes in the movie.] I also liked the youngest penguin Private. He was really funny and he was cute. And I also liked Classified because hes Benedict Cumberbatch. I think he was a little better in Sherlock but thats because they have like nine episodes so you really get to know his mood.Tom Yeah. In this movie he had major mood swings. At the very beginning hes like ""You are the helpless penguins"" and by the end hes like ""you guys are amazing.""What did you guys think of Dave the Octopus?Alex I thought he was really funny.Tom I thought it was very weird that he could make it look like he was a human. That was very strange. And Im kind of surprised that when he turns all the penguins into monsters and hes pretending to be human the other humans didnt notice that he was sticking to walls and doing all that octopus stuff. I think I would have noticed that.So if you were making a Penguins of Madagascar movie what kind of animal do you think would make a good villain?Tom Oooh. Maybe a leopard seal because leopard seals are the enemies of penguins.Alex Id make the leopard seals henchmen like really tough henchmen-slash-bodyguards.And what would you make the main villain?Alex Maybe like a big seahorse?""It was much better than I expected from the commercials.""How did this movie compare to other animated movies you saw this year like Big Hero 6 and How to Train Your Dragon 2 and The Lego Movie?Alex I think there were a lot of great movies this year and its hard to compare them.Tom I think Big Hero 6 is still the best. Its nice and its sweet and its very sad and funny. And then this movie--I think its a tough call but this was probably better than the other animated movies this year. And it was better than Madagascar 3.Alex It was much better than I expected from the commercials.If you were in charge of coming up with a story idea for a sequel what would it be?Tom The North Wind should help again but this time there should be a much deadlier plot. The Medusa serum was a little gross but ...Not that scary?Tom Yeah.Did it remind you of the ray that turned the minions into monsters in Despicable Me 2?Tom Not really. The monsters in Despicable Me 2 were like invulnerable. They could swallow bombs and not blow up. In this movie the ray just made the penguins look weird.Alex I agree. The Medusa serum was a bad idea. They needed to have something more creative. It didnt really turn the penguins crazy--they still wanted to hug everyone--it just made them ugly. If itd turned them into actual monsters that were bloodthirsty thatd be okay. But instead its like ewww youre ugly. Get over it.What do you think should happen in a sequel Alex?Alex They should go back in time. And they should have new little baby penguins. And theyd have to survive the kinds of things that used to be around.You mean back in prehistoric times? Alex Yeah. And the North Wind would go with them. And I think Classified should be older and almost ready for retirement.So older than me?Alex Yeah.Tom I dont know. Its hard to be that old.Nice. I kinda walked into that one. Any final thoughts on the movie?Tom It was a very good movie for people who like action and comedy. If you liked Madagascar youll like this.Alex I thought it was really funny and there were a lot of good characters. And if you watch Sherlock it has [stage whisper] Benedict Cumberbatch in it.So in sum Benedict Cumberbatch is terrific--but you already knew that--and judging penguins solely on their appearance is not cool even if theyve been mutated by an octopus villains ray machine. More to the point if youre looking to kill a few family-time hours over the holiday weekend you could do worse than Penguins of Madagascar especially if youve already seen Big Hero 6.

Twitter previousThanksgiving Used to Look a Lot Like Halloween Except More RacistnextThe Lois Lane Problem Enough With Clueless TV Sidekicks Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics. Continue Reading Tom Pennington / Getty Images The Mind of Donald Trump Dan P. McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Stephanie Loos/Reuters The Elusive Manipulative Adopted Child Tina Traster Learning how to bond with my daughter who found comfort in the familiarity of being alone has come through understanding reactive attachment disorder. My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion. Continue Reading Gary Cameron / Reuters Trump Time Capsule 62 A Man Who Can Be Baited With a Tweet James Fallows None Last night in her overall very successful acceptance speech Hillary Clinton said with ruthless precision about her opponent Ask yourself Does Donald Trump have the temperament to be Commander-in-Chief? Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day. Continue Reading carianoff/flickr Why Some People Respond to Stress by Falling Asleep Elijah Wolfson Fight or flight or sleep Last month my wife and I found ourselves in a disagreement about whether or not our apartment was clean enough for guests--the type of medium-sized disagreement that likely plagues all close relationships. In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon.

Graham A federal appeals court finds the impact of the states voting law can only be explained by ""discriminatory intent."" Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz.

""Penguins of Madagascar"" is not the studios strongest effort but does provide in time for the holidays lots of high-velocity cartoony action and gags designed to appeal to all demographics. The stars are the same four birds that appeared in modest roles in the three previous ""Madagascar"" pictures. Are they strong enough to carry a feature on their computer-generated backs? For small fry Id say yes but for older viewers the fun may be more intermittent. The story involves a wacky spy mission to stop a heinous villain and with its international locations probably will remind adults of numerous James Bond ""Mission Impossible"" and heist movies. The penguins consider themselves a kind of commando unit and they are constantly striking kung fu poses. The quartets leader is Skipper (voice of Tom McGrath) with a comic military bearing and limited intellect. Kowalski (Chris Miller) is the smart one and Rico (Conrad Vernon) is the explosives expert. The baby of the group Private (Christopher Knights) just wants to be taken seriously. Of course the film plays up the almost frightening cuteness of penguins in part by openly and frequently referring to it. The kiddies are likely to take this at face value but the point is made so often that older viewers will understand that the movie is poking fun at the concept. The penguins mostly rely on their wits and dumb luck but they are forced to work (and compete) with a high-tech multispecies action team lead by a wolf named Classified (Benedict Cumberbatch). They are united by the goal of putting an end to the menace of Dr. Octavius Brine (John Malkovich) a scientist plotting a horrible revenge against the penguins. (Details left out to prevent spoilers.) Directors Eric Darnell and Simon J. Smith keep up a headlong pace -- if one joke or sight gag misfires therell be another one soon. Some of it works like a nice running joke about a cheesy snack food and some is less successful including a series of puns on celebrity names that runs out of gas. For me the highlight is the inspired voice work of Malkovich who has a ball parodying various brainy demented evildoers hes played over the years. (Theres another in-joke involving a certain German movie director and Ill say no more.) Visually the film is impressively polished and makes very good use of 3-D. But overall it seems like a bit of an underachiever. There are stretches that feel like padding which the pedal-to-the-metal pace cant quite cover up. Still theres plenty here to tickle the kids and thats what counts. Walter Addiego is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer. E-mail waddiegosfchronicle.com Penguins of Madagascar  Animated adventure.

Geoff Pevere Special to The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday Nov. 26 2014 1200AM EST Last updated Wednesday Nov. 26 2014 1200AM EST Comments AA Directed by Eric Darnell and Simon J. Smith Written by John Aboud Michael Colton Eric Darnell Tom McGrath and Brandon Sawyer Starring Tom McGrath Werner Herzog John Malkovich Benedict Cumberbatch Classification G Country USA Language English Any kids cartoon that opens with narration by the mondo eccentric German filmmaker Werner Herzog is bound to bring comfort to hearts of certain parents in the house. Theyll know that Penguins of Madagascar is aware that they might wish they were somewhere else and that its going to do its best to compensate for that 50 bucks they just dropped on tickets snack combos and SUV fuel. Less a sequel to the already antic animals-on-the-lam Madagascar franchise than a hopped-up digression from them Penguins caters to all those viewers who wished the scene-stealing tuxedo jockeys from those movies - Skipper Kowalski Private and Rico - would steal a whole movie and waddle off with it. So here it is a cartoon entirely hijacked by penguins and from the outset promising high-velocity silliness to the whole family.Its a promise Penguins co-directed by Madagascar franchise vet Eric Darnell and Simon J. Smith mostly keeps and largely thanks to the dispensing of any expectation that what were about to see might be either just artery-cloggingly cute or about hapless critters cavorting in strange lands. Led by the delusively confident Skipper (voiced by Tom McGrath) this quartet is sprung on its mission of world-saving espionage out of sheer boredom at the prospect of spending even another second marching single file with their complacent cohorts across the vast Antarctic blankness to the predacious delight of documentary crews. (Ergo Herzog in that wicked little cameo.)Liberated from their ice-encrusted continental prison by the pursuit of an egg that will eventually hatch the perennially redundant Private (Christopher Knights) the penguins hop a boat bound for places more spectacularly suited to their particular brand of anti-natural grandiosity and wind up living the dream of superheroic badassery when confronted by the weirdly calcium-deficient figure of Dr. Octavius Brine (John Malkovich) whose wobbliness in human form is soon revealed to the result of the fact hes actually a petulant giant blue octopus named Dave. Once the headline attraction at the Central Park Zoo Dave was relegated to an especially humiliating form of ego deflation after those damned flightless birds became stars and Dave was sidelined to a tank by the public washroom that emptied with every flush. Herein - as if we needed one - is Daves motivation for the ""Medusa serum"" a formula for rendering all penguins about as cute as something backed up by faulty zoo plumbing.Maladroitly teamed with all-animal super-elite spy squad (led by Benedict Cumberbatchs big Brit wolf) known as the North Wind (yes expect those ""breaking Wind"" jokes) the flightless four stuffed to the ear holes with stolen Cheesy Dibbles land in all manner of noisy and explosive scrapes all the while unleashing a running torrent of puns gags artful non-sequiturs and pop cultural shout-outs. While Penguins of Madagascar comes out swinging in the visual mayhem department its really the dialogue that lands the movies punches be it Kowalskis tendency to speak momentum-killing truths (""You have no family"" he tells the freshly hatched Private. ""And were all going to die."") or Daves habit of gratuitous celebrity name-bombing while barking orders ""William Hurt"" ""Drew Barry More""Having apparently left the more polished execution and prestige feature animation rep to its multiply Oscar-blessed competitor Pixar Penguins Dreamworks production company has apparently wisely decided to take the low road compensating in the sheer cheek department for what it lacks in gold-plated status. In this it now seems to have assumed the role in the CGI feature cartoon sweepstakes that Warner Brothers cartoons once adopted in tactical opposition to the mighty Disney studio that of the wackier little brother with nothing to lose. Leaving the cute to the bigger kids on the block with this movie Dreamworks is opting for pure crazy. And sure enough the strategy this time anyway has paid off in the most unnatural dividend imaginable darned if these penguins dont fly.

As the title suggests Skipper Kowalski Rico and Private now have their own showcase and their globe-trotting solo adventure unfolds like an avalanche of A.D.D action. Whereas Pixars best films have traditionally been framed by finely-tuned plot and character that target audiences of all ages DreamWorks Animations Penguins of Madagascar aims primarily for the kiddies racing from one frenetic action sequence to another like some haywire Walter Lantz cartoon. The thin plot involves the penguin quartet being pursued by a vengeful octopus (John Malkovich) who hates the cute and cuddly birds that stole his spotlight at a multitude of zoos and aquariums before he dedicated his life to evil. Hes built a special weapon that can transform the beloved black and white creatures into grotesque mutants and when the four stumble into a trap baited with cheese-puffs they have to rely on a secret-intelligence unit led by a by-the-book gray wolf voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch. The spycraft elements combined with the promotion of silly sideshow characters--not unlike Mater or the Minions--will make adults feel like theyre watching a poor-mans Cars or Despicable Me sequel. But kids might be laughing too hard to care. Still you wish that orange cheese-puff dust wasnt such a strong metaphor for the nutritional value of the entire film.

The latest installment in Dreamworks Animations surprisingly lucrative globe-hopping talking-animal franchise is refreshingly devoid of subtlety or emotional resonance or even proper story structure. Its most nuanced joke is its very existence The penguins were always the best part of the Madagascar series so now they have their own movie and the other animals are not particularly pleased about it. Specifically the penguins popularity has driven one particular creature Dave the Octopus (voiced by John Malkovich) mad with jealousy and resentment. The new film is a James Bond-ian adventure involving the Dr. Evil-like Daves deviously inane plan to kidnap and turn New Yorks penguins into gruesome monsters thus extinguishing their cuteness and hopefully their public appeal. Along the way our adorably incompetent heroes find themselves allied with an expert task force of Arctic animals led by a stuck-up wolf (voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch). The latters name is classified so hes known as Classified. Ill admit it I was pretty lost for vast stretches of Penguins of Madagascar but not necessarily in a bad way. Loose fast and free the film throws every possible dumb gag at you as it races along. Half the time you laugh at a joke before you can decide if the joke is good or not. Observe In the films most notable running gag Dave bellows out orders to his tentacled minions each of whom has been named for maximum wordplay potential ""Drew Barry ... more power ... Hugh Jack ... man the cannon ... Nick cage the penguins"" Is that even funny? Im still not sure But the films insistence on it is pretty impressive. By the end I couldnt decide if I was laughing at the joke itself or the fact that the film was still going at it repeating the same gag in countless iterations. Relentless frivolity certainly has its place and has a long tradition. Penguins of Madagascar doesnt have the bracing irreverence or breakneck inventiveness of The Emperors New Groove (a film whose classic status is further confirmed with each passing day) but it does have some of that same freewheeling throw-everything-at-the-wall-and-see-what-sticks spirit. And theres actually something refreshing about an animated film these days that doesnt try to pull your heartstrings that doesnt put you in the position of having to determine if it has earned its emotions or merely manipulated them. All Penguins of Madagascar wants to do is make you laugh at its silliness. It succeeds.

While their feature debut certainly scores some laughs it also fails to maintain momentum or to justify its rather bizarre premise.For the uninitiated The penguins in question are Skipper (the leader) Kowalski (the smart one) Private (the simpleton) and Rico (the loopy mute). While Skippers blustering authority and Privates dopey earnestness register on their own kudos if you can remember anything about the other two beyond their basic archetypes.Together the four form a secret-agent team of sorts an idea that works better in the larger context of the ""Madagascar"" series but feels rather random in isolation. But the oddity of that central conceit still pales in comparison to the enemy our foursome face. A mad octopus scientist (the delightfully oily voice of John Malkovich) is out to transform our protagonists and a string of other penguins into ugly mutants as revenge for the birds repeatedly stealing his limelight in a string of zoos.Yes its a childrens cartoon and silliness is the point but even Elmer Fudd or Wile E. Coyote could do better than that. The filmmakers are clearly going for that Looney Tunes spirit and they dont come up completely empty-handed. Some action scenes like a hyperactive chase through the canals of Venice are truly amazing in their visual cleverness.But theres just not enough substance to the basic concept to merit a full-length feature.

By NANCY CHURNIN Follow nchurnin nchurnindallasnews.com Staff Writer Published 25 November 2014 0716 PM Updated 02 December 2014 1150 AM Related Escape from the holiday mayhem with a good movie First Mockingjay is a savvy look at how to sell a war (B+) Cuteness is good but it cant save the day -- unless youre in Penguins of Madagascar. Because this 3-D animated film makes the very cuteness that tough penguins abhor the key to their survival.After winning fans as supporting characters in the first three Madagascar movies Skipper Kowalski Rico and Private get their origin tale. Its a fast funny romp that begins with a mockery of penguin documentaries continues with a daring rescue that bonds them and segues into a mission to save penguinkind from the tentacles of Octavius Brine.Like Optimus Prime from the Transformers franchise Octavius Brine (voiced by John Malkovich) can transform just not into a good guy.The snappy dialogue smart voice work and delicious DreamWorks animation should keep the 10 and younger crowd breezing happily through a predictable plot. Private (Christopher Knights) wants to prove himself a valuable team member in a story thats a fusion of Toy Story 2 with Brine like the embittered Prospector from that film wanting revenge on the popular and last years Despicable Me 2 in which a serum turned minions into monsters. Here a secret ray is turned on penguins.Benedict Cumberbatch brings exasperated superiority to Agent Classified the wolf that heads a slick interspecies spy agency. He leads even unflappable Skipper (Tom McGrath) to doubt himself.The film fleshes out the penguin personalities with Chris Miller delivering an analytical Kowalski with a soft spot for a fetching owl and the less verbal Rico (Conrad Vernon) devouring everything in sight.Ongoing gags aimed at parents make fun of celebrity names ""Kevin bake on"" Brine urges noting theyll need a victory cake. Its hard to resist. May the sequels commence.Penguins of Madagascar (B)Directed by Simon J. Smith and Eric Darnell. PG (mild action and some rude humor). 92 mins. In wide release.

"Penguins of Madagascar dont soar they spin out review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesPenguins of Madagascar dont soar they spin out review Spinoffs are common with hit animation franchises but Penguins of Madagascar might be more accurately referred to as a spin-out.Dont be surprised if you are craving Cheetos after seeing Penguins of Madagascar.By Peter HowellMovie CriticTues. Nov. 25 2014Penguins of MadagascarAnimated comedy featuring the voices of Benedict Cumberbatch John Malkovich Tom McGrath Chris Miller Conrad Vernon and Christopher Knights. Directed by Eric Darnell and Simon J. Smith. At GTA theatres. 92 minutes. GSpinoffs are common with hit animation franchises but Penguins of Madagascar might be more accurately referred to as a spin-out.So much manic energy is expended putting these waddlers through their paces as they strike out on adventures far from their Madagascar roost it often seems as though they might ricochet right off the screen.Article Continued BelowAnd its all in service of a very thin story that occasionally approaches brilliance but too often settles for a rote 007 ripoff -- we even hear the James Bond theme at one point. There are visual puns and verbal riffs on other movies too including Raiders of the Lost Ark Planet of the Apes and Life of Pi.If members of the DreamWorks screenwriting committee had expended as much effort on the plot as they did penning puns with celebrity names (Nicolas Cage and Drew Barrymore among them) there might be less reason to carp about this kettle o fish.Directed by Eric Darnell (the Madagascar franchise) and Simon J. Smith (Bee Movie) the film starts off cleverly enough with an Antarctic back story about how the penguin quartet of Skipper (Tom McGrath) Kowalski (Chris Miller) Rico (Conrad Vernon) and Private (Christopher Knights) first frolicked together on the same floe.Its presented as a documentary made and narrated by Werner Herzog who actually did once make a doc Encounters at the End of the World which featured the flightless avian superstars he calls ""frisky little snow clowns.""But once that film-savvy prologue ends Penguins of Madagascar quickly settles into 007 parody mode as Skipper Kowalski Rico and Private embark on a quest that spans the globe (including a stop in Shanghai for that economically essential China connection).Theyre in pursuit of Dr. Octavius Brine (John Malkovich) a.k.a. Dave a jealous octopus who once commanded eyeballs as a major zoo attraction but who lost popular favour after penguins entered the scene. Hes out to get revenge with an army of stooge octopi and a ""Medusa serum"" that will turn those ""snow clowns"" into scary monsters.Helping in the hunt is an animal spy agency known as North Wind which of course leads into a joke how ""nobody can break the Wind."" The agency is led by a pompous wolf (Benedict Cumberbatch) who is so into being undercover hes referred to only as Agent Classified.It may be a case of damning with faint praise to say that Penguins of Madagascar never really gets a chance to bore since it never slows down. The humour is rarely cheesy although much is made of a puffed fromage snack called Cheezy Dibbles that looks suspiciously like a product placement -- dont be surprised if you crave Cheetos after the film.And the movie never gets flat because its in 3D.All of which should be enough to delight the small fry the movie is expressly aimed at while occasionally prodding a smile out of the adults who accompany them.But these wacky birds could have truly soared if a little more attention had been paid to storytelling basics.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Talking-animal spy comedy Penguins of Madagascar a spin-off of talking-animal prison-break comedy Madagascar and its sequels plays like a sampler of Dreamworks Animations worst creative impulses sugar-rush pacing pandering meta-gags and a slick flavorless animation style.

Malkovichs Octavius Brine a malevolent octopus and Cumberbatchs Classified an uptight wolf-cum-superspy serve as comic foils for the hyperactive happy-go-lucky penguin protagonists bossy Skipper (Tom McGrath) level-headed Kowalski (Chris Miller) dimwitted Rico (Conrad Vernon) and nervous-nelly Private (Christopher Knights). Following these devil-may-care penguins manic attempts to help Classified stop Brine from kidnapping penguins around the world is like being trapped on a runaway wooden roller coaster for 95 minutes. First Skipper and his group binge on junk food at Fort Knox. Then they flee from evil octopi in a Venetian gondola race.

Photo Credit AP / DreamWorks Animation advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The paramilitary penguins of the ""Madagascar"" movies meet a rival task force. Rated PG. BOTTOM LINE Passable entertainment if youre 7. Otherwise frenzied and aimless. CAST Benedict Cumberbatch John Malkovich Tom McGrath LENGTH 132 Before the babbling minions of Universals ""Despicable Me"" movies became so popular there were the wisecracking penguins of DreamWorks Animations ""Madagascar"" films. The first in 2005 introduced the penguins as four bumblers who believe they comprise a military task force. It seemed like a limited joke but in 2008 Nickelodeon gave the penguins their own series and now DreamWorks is giving them their first feature. Its easy to see why the penguins appeal to children because they essentially are children. Skipper (the voice of executive producer Tom McGrath) is the groups fearless and clueless leader; Kowalski (Chris Miller) handles technical details; Rico (animator Conrad Vernon) wrecks stuff; Private (Christopher Knights) is their lovable tag-along. Like children the penguins are forever playacting in a make-believe world yet never come to real harm. In fact their various mishaps and indignities merely force everyone else to play the long-suffering adult. In the 2005 film it was the penguins who accidentally sent the main characters to Madagascar in the first place. advertisement | advertise on newsday Like the Nickelodeon series ""Penguins of Madagascar"" takes place almost entirely in the penguins free-associative fantasy. First they break into Fort Knox. That leads to a confrontation with Dave (John Malkovich) an evil octopus who masquerades as human. Intruding on their showdown however is the North Wind a far more professional task force led by a snooty wolf named Classified (a silky Benedict Cumberbatch). His hastily sketched colleagues are a polar bear a seal and a rather vixenish owl (the voices of Peter Stormare Ken Jeong and Annet Mahendru respectively). Frenetically directed by Simon J. Smith and Eric Darnell from a multi-writer screenplay ""Penguins of Madagascar"" makes little sense even on its own terms. Weird details rankle When Classified bemoans the loss of his ""19 million plane"" it brings up ideas of real-world currency and aerospace manufacturers. Contemporary references abound and Daves octopi-henchmen are occasion for various celebrity-based puns like ""Nicholas? Cage them"" ""Penguins of Madagascar"" was clearly made for children but it also feels like it was made by them. Maybe thats exactly the point. 248 MoviesPenguins of Madagascar trailer Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

Once an idea such as DreamWorks Madagascartakes off its not too long before theres a second or third installation and films that should have gone straight to DVD get upgraded to box-office fare. Case in point Penguins of Madagascar. It pokes fun at its own spinoff status right from the start with a reference to the catchy yet annoying dance song I Like to Move It made popular by the previous films. The movie even pays tongue-in-cheek homage to the tons of documentary films chronicling the lives of the cute cuddly penguins with a doc sequence voiced over by director Werner Herzog ( Encounters at the End of the World).However even with all of the well-intentioned references and good humor Penguins doesnt break new ground. The film is fun light-hearted fare that could be watched in the comfort of a long car ride to Grandmas house. Penguins tells the back story of the quartet of birds led by the Skipper ( Tom McGrath co-creator of the Madagascar characters) who turns everything into a covert military operation. His underlings include Kowalski (Chris Miller) the mastermind of the group and Rico (Conrad Vernon) the belcher who likes to blow things up. Then theres Private (Christopher Knights) the cutest of the bunch. In Skippers eyes hes just decoration but Private wants to earn his keep in the operation. The story begins with how Private was hatched and how the group ended up so far from its home in Antarctica to wind up in the New York City Zoo the original site of the films as well as the Penguins TV series.Flash-forward to Privates birthday celebration during which Skipper decides to raid the most secure facility in North America Fort Knox for precious . . . Cheesy Dibbles? Thats right. Apparently the cheesy crunchy snack is worth more than gold to the penguins who manage to get stuck in a vending machine and whisked off by a nemesis with an unfamiliar dastardly name Dave.Dave aka Dr. Octavius Brine is an octopus with an ax to grind. As the star attraction at the New York Zoo he was mortified after being ousted by the tremendously popular cuter-than-cute penguins. As he kept getting moved from zoo to aquarium to zoo his hatred of the cuddly creatures grew so that Dave (voiced by a devilish John Malkovich) concocted a plan to rid the world of his adorable foes. ""You took everything from me"" he tells the penguins.The situation looks bleak for the feathered friends until a new group of heroes emerges to save them. An actual covert group known as The North Wind comes to the penguins rescue. Led by Agent Classified ( Benedict Cumberbatch of Sherlock fame) a wolf with a power trip the team consists of Short Fuse (Ken Jeong) a small seal with explosives expertise; Eva (Annet Mahendru) an intelligence analyst and brainy owl; and Corporal (Peter Stomare) a polar bear with a big heart. The groups motto ""Nobody breaks the Wind."" While the two espionage groups clash in style they ultimately must work together to defeat their common foe Dave to save penguin-kind.The penguins humorous exploits were fine comedic distractions in previous films. Yet as the center of their own feature much of the comedy falls flat and some of the funnier references get old by the end of the film such as Daves celebrity-themed verbal gags ""Nicolas cage them"" Penguins proves there can be too much of a cute thing.

"Review Penguins of Madagascar hit by a blizzard of puns - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Penguins of Madagascar hit by a blizzard of puns Penguins of Madagascar DreamWorks Animation Kowalski (voiced by Chris Miller) left Skipper (Tom McGrath) Rico (Conrad Vernon) and Private (Christopher Knights) are comrades in arms on a mission in ""Penguins of Madagascar."" The film didnt do well for DreamWorks. Kowalski (voiced by Chris Miller) left Skipper (Tom McGrath) Rico (Conrad Vernon) and Private (Christopher Knights) are comrades in arms on a mission in ""Penguins of Madagascar."" The film didnt do well for DreamWorks. (DreamWorks Animation) Betsy Sharkey Review The birds of Penguins of Madagascar are comedy gold but the barrage of fowl puns can be overwhelming Its hard to go wrong with penguins.They can be elegant and emotionally engaging in real life as the Oscar-winning documentary ""March of the Penguins"" beautifully captured. They can also be toe-tapping hysterical and wildly musical as they proved in the animated hit ""Happy Feet."" So how did ""Penguins of Madagascar"" run ... afoul?Assault with unfortunate turns of phrase like that I would say. The pun is a gun for ""Penguins"" writers. Not a sharpshooter rifle but a machine gun that unloads a nonstop quip barrage mowing down the real promise of this 3-D animation action comedy. For many there will be enough reward to offset the risk but do consider a flak jacket.On the plus side the central characters -- Skipper (Tom McGrath) Kowalski (Chris Miller) and Rico (Conrad Vernon) -- are proven comedy troopers. Already popular in the ""Madagascar"" films and their own TV series a movie spinoff must have seemed a no-brainer. Video Trailer Penguins of Madagascar ""Penguins of Madagascar"" ""Penguins of Madagascar"" See more videos An adorable baby penguin chick (Christopher Knights) has been added to the mix. Keeping up the military precision with which these particular bird buddies operate hes dubbed Private. And hes got major cuteness powers which he will if necessary use so watch out.There is an elite black-ops team the North Wind fighting the same good fight as the covert penguins. The result wire-crossing complications and the films most extensively animated action scenes. The Wind is led by the appropriately arrogant gray wolf agent named Classified voiced with a great deal of brio by Benedict Cumberbatch. Penguins of Madagascar DreamWorks Animation Agent Classified (voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch) left and Skipper (Tom McGrath) in ""Penguins of Madagascar."" Agent Classified (voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch) left and Skipper (Tom McGrath) in ""Penguins of Madagascar."" (DreamWorks Animation) The villain Dave a.k.a. Dr. Octavius Brine is a purple octopus with a bruised ego and brilliantly brought to life in one of those great arranged marriages between animation creativity and voice agility -- in this case John Malkovich providing the verbal theatricsAnimation veterans are in charge starting with directors Eric Darnell (the ""Madagascar"" films) and Simon J. Smith (Jerry Seinfelds ""Bee Movie""). The screenplay was in the hands of the TV and film writing team John Aboud and Michael Colton plus Brandon Sawyer an Emmy-winning staff writer on ""The Penguins of Madagascar"" TV series.The animation itself is madcap crazy in weaving together tight scrapes and cultural references. Typical is the opening shot in Antarctica with penguins making a lemming-like march to a hole in the ice. Werner Herzog whose documentary ""Encounters at the End of the World"" took a rather more serious look at the region provides ponderous narration. Cut to the film crew that is shooting it....That particular mash-up is a fine one. It reflects the sort of pop cultural multilayering for which DreamWorks Animation has come to be known.This makes ""Penguins of Madagascar"" a surprising slip for the studio which usually has its animation ducks in a row -- or dragons or pandas or Shreks. Penguins should have made the lineup.The story like everything else tries to do too much. Its an origins story a mission impossible a coming-of-age saga a revenge story.After that brief opening bit in the cold an action sequence sets the four comrades in arms on a globe-hopping journey of having fun and righting wrongs. Soon they are in Daves clutches. A flashback to a SeaWorld-styled aquarium explains his issues Dave ruled until the penguins turned up and stole the oohs and aahs. Now hes penguin enemy No. 1.Fortunately at least for Dave hes also a scientific genius who has spent the intervening years collecting snow globes and concocting some yucky green stuff. Dave by the way is equally comfortable tucked inside his Dr. Brine lab coat and gloves as he is going au naturel all tentacles teeth and bulbous big head. Hes got an octopus army of various bright colors which looks pretty cool doing his nefarious bidding.Dave is able to get a lot done since Skipper and his crew are constantly jockeying for position with Classified and the North Wind team. When the green stuff hits the fan so do the life lessons.The ones to remember are Sometimes you have to sacrifice a lot to help your friends good guys can accomplish more if they work together never make a purple octopus angry and when in doubt dont let the puns kill the fun.Twitter betsysharkey------------Penguins of MadagascarMPAA rating PG for mild action and some rude humorRunning time 1 hour 32 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Entertainment Reviews Animation (Movie Genre) Action (Movie Genre) Penguins of Madagascar (tv program) Conrad Vernon Read more movie reviews gt;gt; Jurassic World trailer Be careful tinkering with that DNA Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad76deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-penguins-madagascar-review-20141125-column.html,200,penguinsofmadagascar17,penguinsofmadagascar,latimes

They have after all been the series runaway favorites since DreamWorks Animation released ""Madagascar"" in 2005 -- enough so to land their own show on Nickelodeon. But while their escapades are entertaining enough for quick-fire episodes of childrens television they prove wanting fodder for a feature-length film.The film begins promisingly enough. Werner Herzog lends his thoughtful German-accented cadence to a documentarian filming penguins in Antarctica a clever riff on his career and the pop-cultural penguin fanaticism that kicked off with 2005s ""March of the Penguins."" These are pre-""Madagascar"" days and a defiant young penguin trio -- Skipper Kowalski and Rico (voiced by Tom McGrath Chris Miller and Conrad Vernon) -- break from the pack in Antarctica to rescue a runaway egg. That egg hatches Private (Christopher Knights) the cuddliest if most undistinguished member of the eccentric crew.More azcentral.coms newest movie reviewsThats the sum total of emotional investment and character building you can expect from ""Penguins of Madagascar."" Now a thrill-seeking tactical crew engaged in espionage and paramilitary-like mission the four penguins fall neatly into their respective roles Skipper as the leader Kowalski as the brains Rico as the crazed oddball Private as the rookie struggling to define himself. (What do you bet he finally gets the chance?)Private Skipper Kowalski and Rico attempt to save their fellow species from a revenge seeking mad scientist in ""The Penguins of Madagascar."" (Photo DreamWorks Animation)They run afoul of Dr. Brine a nefarious octopus disguised as a particularly flexible human mad scientist (voiced with seeming relish by John Malkovich). Dr. Brine is hatching a revenge plot against penguins worldwide for snagging all the aquarium attention with their cuteness. In a partnership thats more friendly rivalry the penguins team up with North Wind (named as such no doubt solely to set up the inevitable ""breaking wind"" gag) an elite undercover interspecies task force dedicated to protecting animals.Its not that ""Penguins of Madagascar"" is a particularly bad movie its that its so incredibly rote. All the glossy kinetic animation and inventive action sequences get lost in the gag machine. The film throws jokes out like a tennis-ball machine on the fritz gross humor slapstick pratfalls bizarre non sequiturs.The randomness does land a few laughs but its also exhausting. And when the laughs dont land they leave you wondering what audience the writers thought they were trying to entertain. Theres a running gag in the film that involves awkwardly wedging celebrity names into dialogue (nothing gets the kids going like a random Parker Posey shout-out) which is slightly more relevant than jokes about French tax laws and Riverdance.Sometimes less is more. Comic-relief side characters are best enjoyed in small doses especially when the jump from minor character to major character feels more like obligation than inspiration.Penguins of Madagascar3 starsDirectors Eric Darnell Simon J.

Youll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Absurd flightless birds prove to be ready for the spotlight in animated spinoff By Michael OSullivan November 25 2014 The career trajectory of the four wisecracking cartoon penguins introduced as minor characters in ""Madagascar"" has been one of meteoric ascendancy with return appearances in two sequels a couple of stand-alone shorts and a television show. Its not an unusual path in animated Hollywood. Weve seen it before with Scrat the saber-toothed squirrel from ""Ice Age"" who parlayed a cameo in the first film into a cottage industry of increasingly annoying shorts and a camera-hogging turn in the second sequel ""Dawn of the Dinosaurs."" But unlike that acorn-obsessed chipmunk-cheeked paleo-rodent ham the Flightless Four known as Skipper Kowalski Rico and Private are ready for their moment in the sun. ""Penguins of Madagascar"" is a delightfully silly star turn for this quartet of absurd little birds who operate as a team of commandos. There are several reasons why this works. First is the voice talent. Although none of them is a marquee name the actors who bring the penguins to life -- Tom McGrath Chris Miller Conrad Vernon and Christopher Knights -- do so with verve. (Special credit goes to Vernon who voices the almost nonverbal but nevertheless vocally expressive Rico who is often shown coughing up indigestible objects that he has swallowed.) Other notably funny turns in ""Penguins"" include John Malkovich and Benedict Cumberbatch. Playing to type the A-list actors provide the voices for respectively a villainous emotionally unstable octopus named Dave and a heroic cucumber-cool secret agent gray wolf whose name is classified. (Thats right The characters name is never given -- ""My name is classified"" he tells us in Cumberbatchs mellifluous British baritone -- leading to some giddy ""Whos on first?"" confusion.) 1 of 14 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad x Holiday Movie Guide 2014 View Photos Check out our holiday movie superlatives full of postulations about what youre likely to get with the buzziest upcoming releases. (Release dates are subject to change.) Caption Check out our holiday movie superlatives. Most likely to make you want to learn the lyrics so you can sing along next time ""Into the Woods"" Stephen Sondheim and James Lapines Broadway musical is a complicated and rather dark affair in which the heroes of various fairy tales cross paths in a forest. You can bet this new adaptation courtesy of Disney will be both simplified and slightly more family-friendly. Regardless of how you feel about the changes great music remains -- the stage show won the Tony for best original score and best book after all -- and theres a standout cast that includes Meryl Streep (pictured) Anna Kendrick Johnny Depp and Emily Blunt. (Dec. 25. PG.) Peter Mountain/Disney Enterprises Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Which brings me to the real reason for the movies success the writing of the story which concerns Daves plot to kidnap penguins from all of the worlds zoos and turn them into monsters. Fleshing out characters created by ""Madagascar"" directors and writers Eric Darnell and McGrath (whose voice propels Skippers MacGyver-like can-do spirit) the screenplay by John Aboud Michael Colton and Brandon Sawyer has a fizzy pop-culture pizazz tempered by a distinctly vaudeville sensibility. Its smart but not brainy; dumb but never inane. Colton who was an editor of the Harvard Lampoon in college worked briefly at The Washington Post in the late 1990s before leaving to form the now-defunct online magazine Modern Humorist with Aboud. Their work with Sawyer a childrens TV writer whose credits include the ""Penguins"" series on Nickelodeon is perfectly aimed at the target demographic of silly but savvy 10-year-olds. One recurring joke involves Dave barking orders to his tentacled henchmen leading to a series of increasingly nutty puns name-checking famous movie stars ""Nicolas cage them"" ""Charlize there on the death ray"" ""Drew barry more"" Its gloriously juvenile but also very very funny. Other ingredients in this self-referential pop-culture puree include a cameo by the German director Werner Herzog voicing the filmmaker-narrator of the penguin documentary that opens the film in Antarctica where its prologue is set. Observing that our four heroes are ""frozen with fear"" on an icy precipice Herzog orders his sound man to ""give them a shove"" in order to increase the drama. And increase it he does. One of those early scenes features a leopard seal eating a seagull. Its an indication of the dark edge that will give the story its slightly grown-up astringency. ""Penguins of Madagascar"" is by no means inappropriate for kids but theres a coolly self-aware smirk to it that makes it palatable to people with drivers licenses too. And oh yes the 3-D animation is a treat. But the real charm of the film is its stars. As Skipper says ""A good plan is about more than effecty stuff and big words."" Thats equally true of a good movie.    1/2 PG. At area theaters. Contains mild action and some rude humor. 92 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

(AP Photo/DreamWorks Animation) DreamWorks Animation This image released by DreamWorks Animation shows Skipper voiced by Tom McGrath in a scene from ""The Penguins of Madagascar."" (AP Photo/DreamWorks Animation) Forget everything you thought you knew about penguins Skipper (voiced by Tom McGrath) Kowalski (Chris Miller) Rico (Conrad Vernon) and Private (Christopher Knights) march to their own tune. As such they dont require any narration by Morgan Freeman. But to keep up with their adventures 3-D glasses are definitely required -- and those adventures take the troubleshooting quartet all over the world.Skipper and his crew face one of their biggest challenges in dealing with Dr. Octavius Brine (John Malkovich) an octopus with an ego to rival a Bond villain. Brine who disguises himself as a goofy-looking human has a longstanding grudge against penguins -- and a sinister plan to end their reign of cuteness.Brine and his octopus army are also on the radar of Classified (Benedict Cumberbatch) an espionage agent who happens to be a wolf. Classified doesnt have much respect for the penguins but is willing to tolerate them if that means bringing down Brine. What ensues is a relentless procession of animated mayhem that has little to do with classical storytelling and everything to do with the imperative of cynically pandering to short attention spans.""Penguins of Madagascar"" a spinoff of the popular big-screen animated franchise strives to be entertaining but for much of its run time it is so emotionally uninvolving that even the smallest children might find themselves bored.Still the 3-D effects are more than adequate and Cumberbatch (who rose to fame in PBSs ""Sherlock"") and the drolly compelling Malkovich deliver vocal performances that almost redeem the largely inconsequential goings-on.The same cannot be said for the four penguins at the center of the action who are about as interesting as the protagonists of the average TV cartoon show. Particularly annoying is Skipper a clueless loudmouth that children would be ill-advised to adopt as a role model. As Skipper and his companions acknowledge early on penguins dont fly. And neither does this movie.

Rated PG (potty humor). At the Empire the Union Square others. A 90-minute toy commercial masquerading as a movie -- Hasbro recently tried to acquire sponsor DreamWorks Animation -- ""Penguins of Madagascar is a lazy noisy ADHD-addled collection of animated cliches guaranteed to give anyone older than 5 a headache even if you dont see it in optional 3-D. Borrowing the most annoyingly talky aspects of the ""Ice Age and ""Despicable Me cartoons and throwing in a voice cameo by Werner Herzog this cash-grabbing spinoff of DWAs not-great ""Madagascar series focuses on a trio of minor characters who worked better in small doses -- without a scintilla of the wit or charm of the animated penguin musical ""Happy Feet. Or the star power Tom McGrath Chris Miller and Conrad Vernon voice a trio of personality-free penguins who rescue an egg that grows up to be voiced by Christopher Knights. The tiresomely generic spy story has them caught up in a plot by a giant blue octopus -- sometimes posing as a mad scientist and voiced by a wasted John Malkovich -- who plots a nonsensical revenge on the penguins that he envies because of their alleged cuteness. Trying to stop this villain -- despite the penguins inept assistance -- is an ""elite interspecies task force headed by a snippy British wolf (the ubiquitous Benedict Cumberbatch). A series of wearyingly familiar chases (and plugs for Cheez Doodles) takes us through Fort Knox Venice and Shanghai before a frantically anticlimactic finale in Battery Park City. The writers of ""Penguins of Madagascar seem to think its endlessly hilarious to make puns of famous actors names but even Malkovich cant pull of lame lines like ""Nicholas cage them Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Filed under dreamworks animation  movie reviews Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Horrible Bosses 2 is . . . well horrible Read Next Horrible Bosses 2 is . . . well horrible Most Popular This Week 1 Why Obamas half-brother says hell be voting for Donald Trump 2 The parents who didnt sue Disney taught America a powerful lesson 3 The most undervalued women in America are childless aunts 4 How Hillary blew her big moment 5 Clinton campaigns move to force Trump super-PAC ad off TV 6 Taking out a reverse mortgage ruined my life Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 42626 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 21540 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 14896 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Directed by Eric Darnell (the ""Madagascar"" trilogy) and Simon J. Smith (""Bee Movie"") the unfunny unmoving and uninspired ""Penguins"" never persuades us of its need to exist. Sure theres a muddled lesson at the end as tacked on as a Post-It on a piece of week-old cake. See photos 10 Eye-Popping Into the Woods Character Posters Anna Kendrick Chris Pine Emily Blunt (Photos) As with so many cases of overcompensation a frenetic logorrhea is marshaled to cover up a glaring fault in this case the films distinct lack of purpose. The manic result makes the mistaken assumption that all children suffer from untreated ADHD and that any adult could walk out of the theater without a headache. Speaking of demographics ""Penguins"" is the umpteenth DreamWorks project that caters to an audience that doesnt exist. Jokes about Werner Herzog (who enjoys a cameo) Parker Posey and NPR pledge drives will fly over the heads of eight-year-olds while the hectic pacing and feather-light character motivations make the tale of four nice penguins and the evil purple octopus that wants to destroy them too silly to satisfy adults. Instead of appealing to both age groups ""Penguins"" uses the presumed wants of each as an excuse to disappoint the other. There isnt much to the films story and yet its stuffed to the gills with plot. The penguins Skipper Kowalski Rico Private (voiced by Tom McGrath Chris Miller John DiMaggio and Christopher Knights) -- goofy do-gooders who take pride in their MacGyver-ish knack for fast-thinking and prop deployment -- zip from Antarctica to Fort Knox to Italy to Shanghai to Brazil (but not France; ""Not with those tax laws"") to stop Dave the Octopus (John Malkovich) from kidnapping tuxedoed birds all around the world and squirting them with a mysterious bright-green serum. Also read Alec Baldwin and Kevin Spacey to Voice DreamWorks Animations Boss Baby A toothed mollusk with a dancers ambition for novel movements Dave could have been a compelling villain but Malkovichs velvety tenor is wasted on the octopus tic of pointless celebrity puns like ""Nicolas Cage them"" and ""Elijah Wood you please take them away?"" Getting in the avian quartets way is the highly trained technologically advanced North Wind a paramilitary foursome comprised of a wolf an otter an owl and a polar bear. (Depressingly only one of the nine main characters is female and her main purpose is to be sexy. Ill leave it to you to decide which one of those Arctic animals is the most seductive.) Also read Kelly Kulchak Named Head of Current Programming for DreamWorks Animation TV North Winds leader the pompous canine Classified (Benedict Cumberbatch) -- who gains that nickname when he self-importantly announces to the penguins ""My name is classified"" -- is determined to bag Dave himself so he can take all the credit. The films one unreservedly delightful scene finds the penguins fleeing Daves tentacled henchmen on gondolas through the canals then the streets of Venice the birds use the oars as walking stilts while the octopi use their suctioning skills to swing from post to post and catapult across the city. But for too much of its running time ""Penguins"" is heavy on stimuli but short on fun. Its an exercise in bombardment a test of endurance and far from anything resembling a good time.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 833 p.m. EST November 26 2014Dave/Dr. Octavius Brine (John Malkovich) threatens the flock in Penguins of Madagascar.(Photo DreamWorks Animation)Better to see Big Hero 6 again pop in aMadagascar DVD or watch March of the Penguins than bother with the lifeless Penguins of Madagascar ( out of four; rated PG; opens Wednesday nationwide). This is a joyless frenetic film that is very rarely funny.Penguins in general are an adorable lot. But in this limp spinoff the fourth go-round in the Madagascar franchise that began in 2005 they come across as charmless and surprisingly interchangeable.The title is a misnomer given that the birds are rarely in Madagascar. They go from Antarctica to Fort Knox to Venice to somewhere in the desert to Shanghai to New York. They zoom around on all kinds of flying vehicles and contraptions. Mostly they cant stop talking.A penguin threesome breaks off from its flock to chase after a runaway egg. Fast-thinking Kowalski (Chris Miller) bold Skipper (Tom McGrath) and daredevil Rico (Conrad Vernon) end up becoming surrogate family for the young penguin who hatches from the egg whom they call Private (Christopher Knights).Theres a villainous geneticist Dr. Octavius Brine voiced by John Malkovich who beneath his lab coat is a purple octopus named Dave eager to exact revenge on the cute and cuddly penguins that stole his spotlight at a zoo years before. With the help of his octopi henchmen the tentacled Dave plans to turn the quartet -- and dozens of their tuxedoed waddling brethren -- into grotesque monsters via a green serum hes spent the past decade concocting.As the action zings around the zingers dont exactly hit the funny bone. Theres an overblown gag about breaking wind and repetitive puns spinning off celebrity names. Dave yells to his minions ""Nicholas cage them And later ""Halle bury them"" Other names get similarly bandied about -- Hugh Jackman Drew Barrymore Parker Posey Elijah Wood -- but itll be lost on the kids.USA TODAYPenguins Minions march into solo spotlightBenedict Cumberbatch plays the suave wolf Agent Classified. He heads up North Wind a professional paramilitary rescue operation that focuses on animal welfare and consists of a brawny polar bear named Corporal (Peter Stormare) a brainy owl named Eva (Annet Mahendru) and a clever little seal called Short Fuse (Ken Jeong).The animation is hectic with the action sequences more hyperactive and bombarding than enjoyable and presented in 3-D to no discernible advantage. A gondola chase through the canals of Venice makes for the movies only relatively original and lively scene. USA TODAYHeres your stealth look at the new Madagascar spiesThe ending tries to convey a heartfelt message that looks dont matter and actions are what counts. Its a worthy sentiment but feels tacked-on obvious and delivered in a way that falls flat.A recurring joke about the penguins love for Cheeto-like snacks called Cheezy Dibbles is emblematic of the entire movie. Penguins of Madgascar feels like the animation equivalent of junk food. Its empty free of value and forgettable.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Four penguins named Skipper Kowalski Rico and Private join forces with an undercover organization to stop the villainous Dr. Octavius Brine from destroying the world as we know it in Penguins of Madagascar.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Frenetic and frequently funny Penguins Of Madagascar represents the DreamWorks Animation franchise style--which boils down to self-aware but naive talking animals who learn kid-friendly life lessons--at its most palatable. Indebted more to the wackiness of old Warner Bros. shorts than to the realist Pixar sensibility that informs most American animated features Penguins is packed with gags and moves with the kind of gummy elasticity--the stuff of eye-pops anvil drops and giant mallets pulled out of nowhere--thats become awfully rare in the age of computer animation. The last Madagascar feature Europes Most Wanted was an unlikely high-water mark for the DreamWorks brand of animated comedy a hyperactive romp that took the studios usual combination of dated pop-culture references and on-the-nose music cues and turned them into something genuinely fun and deeply weird. However the franchise had started adopting full-tilt cartooniness--embracing its inner Fast amp; Furious in other words--years before with The Penguins Of Madagascar a Nickelodeon spin-off series centered on a quartet of paramilitary penguins. (Though it shares its protagonists and title give or take an article with the series the feature is essentially unrelated.) Here any pretense of pathos which has never DreamWorks strong suit is dropped in favor of physics-defying pursuits bizarre plot turns and nonstop punchlines. Skipper (Tom McGrath) Kowalski (the Chris Miller who directed Puss In Boots not the one who co-directed The Lego Movie) Rico (Conrad Vernon) and Private (Christopher Knights) must race to stop the villainous cephalopod Dave (John Malkovich) and his army of color-changing octopodes from exacting revenge against penguins. (Their motivation jealousy over the attention given to penguins at zoos and aquaria.) This chase flick plot provides a loose framework for parodies and bravura set pieces an extended riff on Encounters At The End Of The World complete with Werner Herzog as the narrator; a terrifying-if-you-think-about-it sequence in which the penguins smash into one jetliner after another after plummeting out of a cargo plane; scenes with a secret task force of arctic animals--led by a wolf voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch who appears to have been cast based on his inability to pronounce ""penguin""--that parody the Space Age designs and chugging guitar score of X-Men First Class; a chase across the canals streets and roofs of Venice with the penguins invertebrate pursuers forced to use gondola oars as stilts to get around on land. The references skew more esoteric and grown-up than anything in the DreamWorks Animation oeuvre; combined with the penguins constant scheming and planning they bring to mind Pinky And The Brain. Of course theres a kid-friendly lesson in there--something about all-knowing Skipper learning to take cute-as-a-button Private seriously--but its lost amid all the blackout gags delayed reveals self-aware references and cartoon-logic showdowns. Not that anyone will mind.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint In ""Penguins of Madagascar"" there is nothing Madagascan. The images in this computer-animated comedy never move into Africa. The vocal cast hails from the United States England Scandinavia and Germany. The locations are European Asian and American where the main snack is an addictive brand of fried munchy-crunchy sticks that look like Cheetos from a weird tanning salon. No druglike nosh whose residue would permanently leave a quartet of aquatic flightless birds stained an unnatural shade of orange could come from the chief grocery juggernaut in the eastern Dark Continent I am pretty sure. The point here is something akin to the classic superhero origin story. It starts in Antarctica introducing a threesome of the charmingly bossy penguins who were supporting players in the earlier ""Madagascar"" films. Moving to the center of things is their would-be officer class leader Skipper (voiced by Tom McGrath with a comic lilt imitating the late Phil Hartman) preternaturally thoughtful Kowalski (Chris Miller) primitive crazy bones Rico (John DiMaggio) and Private the appealing endearing newcomer to the pack (Christopher Knights). The script is a 90-minute nonstop assault of comic monkeyshines without a great deal of focus. The quartet organizes a secret raid on Americas gold depository Fort Knox. Of course being small animals theyre not after a fortune. Instead they stop for a meal and some bluegrass guitar and banjo picking from Flatt amp; Scruggs. They know that this is precisely what anyone would do in Kentucky. This illogically leads to their encounter with their adversary Dr. Octavius Brine. A large purple octopus pretending to be a human doctor hes set to destroy the worlds penguins with his Medusa Serum. After all those endlessly cute fowls stole the stardom at every zoo where he was displayed. PENGUINS OF MADAGASCAR 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG for mild action and some rude humor. This triggers a wide variety of tomfoolery though not the excited trips to seventh heaven that came during the last DreamWorks animated animal epics. ""How to Train Your Dragon 2"" was touchingly meaningful and ""Madagascar 3 Europes Most Wanted"" was funnier and smarter. There are definitely pluses here largely in the outstanding ensemble. John Malkovich of all people plays Octavius with panache mixing the characters jealous plan for revenge with a few small peeks at his achy-breaky heart. The penguin team joins forces with the North Wind spy squad whose wolf leader Agent Classified is played by Benedict Cumberbatch who doesnt get a single day off these days. Cumberbatch gives the intelligence chief a blend of 007-worthy confidence and windbag babble. Even the smallest roles get scene-stealing prestige from Werner Herzog Ken Jeong and Peter Stormare in his full Swedish accent. The humor pushes in so many different directions that the movie feels as if its roaming around lost with Madagascar nowhere in sight. The most sustained visual gag is the uncontrollable Rico swallowing evidence then eventually barfing it up for the spy team. Its sort of amusing briefly. The best sustained gag is one that will zoom past the youngsters as Brine commands his army of evil octopi with mispronounced Hollywood names. ""Nicolas cage them Halle bury them"" Still this is typical fare so fast-paced that it could be a solid favorite. For viewers under 12 that is.

(DreamWorks Animation) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Monday November 24 2014 432 PM Title The Penguins of Madagascar Film Info With the voices of Benedict Cumberbatch John Malkovich. Animated animals in a 3-D spy spoof (132). PG Mild action crude humor. Area theaters. Animated comedies so often turn out to be turkeys that Americas parents will likely be the most grateful for ""Penguins of Madagascar"" a sequel that improves on its underwhelming predecessors. Granted its no classic but a sassy script and good-natured voice work from Benedict Cumberbatch and John Malkovich should keep kids and grownups entertained over the holidays. The entire movie hinges on the penguins who starting out as comic relief in the ""Madagascar"" movies before getting a Nickelodeon series and now their own big-screen spy story. Skipper (voiced by Tom McGrath) Kowalski (Chris Miller) Private (Christopher Knights) and Rico (Conrad Vernon) have been BFFs since birth. Usually theyre as free as well birds but an evil octopus named Dave (Malkovich) captures them. Dave it turns out is nursing a grudge from the days at the Central Park Zoo when the penguin quartet stole the affection of visitors. Now Dave is plotting his revenge against every penguin on the planet. Skipper and his crew consider themselves perfectly capable of handling this threat. But Classified (Cumberbatch) a wolf who leads an international undercover agency disagrees. His elite team has no time for the flightless birds especially when theres an eight-armed villain on the loose. Given the low bar set by the ""Madagascar"" films this spoofy spy sendup comes as a happy surprise. Yes the pacing occasionally drags but the surprisingly sharp humor and well-animated action sequences ought to hold everyones attention. Dave is a particularly delightful villain given excellent life by a joyfully manic Malkovich. Cumberbatch doesnt have much to do but acquits himself honorably. In the end the penguins misadventures are amusing no ones intelligence is insulted and everybody will walk out happy. Thats accomplishment enough to celebrate at any time. During an exhausting holiday week it deserves a little extra gratitude.

While there are plenty of madcap antics to fill a feature all that manic energy ultimately proves to be more exhausting than exhilarating. Lacking the balancing presence of the endearing-neurotic menagerie voiced by Ben Stiller Chris Rock David Schwimmer and Jada Pinkett Smith the franchise which improved noticeably with each installment fails to advance in its fourth go-round. The Thanksgiving weekend offering should still score handsomely although it remains to be seen if some potential box-office thunder might be stolen by the similarly named Nickelodeon series that has been airing regularly since 2009. Read More Netflix Sets Premiere for Madagascar Spinoff Series Things kick off promisingly in Antarctica where dozens of the waddling denizens are the subjects of a documentary voiced with a true stroke of inspiration by the inimitable Werner Herzog. Breaking from the flock to chase after a runaway egg are younger versions of the fearless Skipper (voiced by Tom McGrath) quick-thinking Kowalski (Chris Miller) and loose cannon Rico (Conrad Vernon). Unsurprisingly the occupant of that egg turns out to be the cute runt of the team Private (Christopher Knights) but he isnt the only thing thats been hatched. So has a nefarious plot to corral all of the worlds penguins by the vengeful Dr. Octavius Brine aka Dave (played by John Malkovich with gleeful abandon) an octopus who has figured out a way to make them less adorable. Co-directors Eric Darnell (the three previous Madagascar films) and Simon J. Smith (Bee Movie) admittedly keep the action at a high pitch as the caper ping-pongs from Antarctica to Venice to Shanghai to New York. Read More Interstellar Penguins of Madagascar Among Final Six Foreign Films Approved by China for 2014 Theres much breaking of wind and blowing of chunks along the way but there are also some smart visual gags provided by screenwriters John Aboud Michael Colton and Brandon Sawyer. But even with the added presence of Benedict Cumberbatch playing an undercover operative wolf who goes by the name of Agent Classified the 3D animated Penguins of Madagascar still comes up a bit flat. Without first establishing a sturdier foundation comprised of more individually developed relatable core characters much of the shtick fails to stick.

Charming in small doses the ""Penguins of Madagascar"" prove altogether less irresistible in their feature-length starring debut. The latest example of DreamWorks Animations franchise mania is a frantic peppy in-your-face slice of irreverent toon action but the result is far more snoozy than Looney (as in Tunes). In the wake of summers creatively potent but commercially disappointing ""How to Train Your Dragon 2"" the studio could really use another breakout but ""Penguins"" looks to fall more in line with the (superior) ""Shrek"" spinoff ""Puss in Boots"" and post solid rather than stratospheric returns at the holiday B.O. Overseas reception where each ""Madagascar"" pic has outperformed the last could be friendlier. DreamWorks practically patented the idea of conceiving and marketing animated pics like live-action comedies intended to appeal equally to adults and kids and while this latest pic dutifully tows the company line its also far too juvenile and generic to be of much interest to anyone over the age of 9 (or tasked with finding something to keep a kid occupied for 90 minutes). The intent is to explore the backstory of the scene-stealing penguin quartet from the three previous ""Madagascar"" pics Skipper (voiced by Tom McGrath) Private (Christopher Knights) Kowalski (Chris Miller) and Rico (Conrad Vernon). Repeatedly described as cute and cuddly (although nowhere near as adorable as the cast of George Millers ""Happy Feet"" films) the penguins also fancy themselves super-spies always on the lookout for espionage and intrigue. Or at least thats how Skipper the fearless but not-so-bright leader sees his crew. Kowalski serves as the brains of the operation Rico is the wild card always ready to blow things up and junior member Private simply wants respect -- something narcissistic nincompoop Skipper is too self-involved to recognize. Fortunately theres an international incident brewing so Skipper can spring his team into action and Private can prove his worth in an inevitable 11th-hour triumph. Before the script by Michael Colton John Aboud and Brandon Sawyer can get to its predictable conclusion theres some paint-by-numbers business to take care of. That includes the introduction of chief antagonist Dr. Octavius Brine (John Malkovich) an octopus disguised as an eccentric human scientist who harbors a deep-seated grudge against penguins everywhere for their long history of stealing his shine at zoos and marine parks. Brine commands an octopus army with the dastardly plan of kidnapping penguins and turning them into mutants. Helping the penguins in their battle against Brine is an undercover special task force dubbed the North Wind led by charismatic blowhard Agent Classified (Benedict Cumberbatch) -- a wolf so devoted to his job he wont even reveal his real name. Hes supported by explosives-expert seal Short Fuse (Ken Jeong) brainy and beautiful owl Eva (Annet Mahendru) and brawny polar bear Corporal (Peter Stormare). While Classified and Skipper butt heads its Private who emerges as the animal with the best plan to stop Brine. With hyperactive direction from ""Madagascar"" veteran Eric Darnell and newcomer Simon J. Smith (""Bee Movie"") barely a moment goes by without a wacky shenanigan or massive action setpiece to keep up the relentless pace. The jokes may be plentiful but theyre rarely inspired typified by a Riverdance parody (isnt that way past its expiration date?) kid-friendly bodily-function humor (""Nobody breaks the North Wind"") and Brines increasingly insipid habit of speaking to his minions in celebrity-name puns. (""Nicolas cage them"" ""William hurt them"" At least ""Charlize theyre on the ray"" isnt too shabby.) Limited attempts at heartfelt emotion between the characters play as pure sap undermined by the frankly off-putting personalities of the penguins themselves. Skipper is insufferable Private is a milquetoast doormat Kowalski is an afterthought and Rico doesnt even really speak (or do much else besides chow down on the penguins preferred junk food the repulsive-sounding Cheezy Dibbles). Maybe the penguins were never meant to carry a feature film. (Theyve done just fine as the stars of a Nickelodeon animated series set in an ""alternate timeline"" to avoid continuity conflicts with the bigscreen franchise.) As voiced by a quartet of behind-the-scenes craftsmen (McGrath Miller and Vernon primarily work as directors and Knights as an editor) they lack the flair and personality necessary for starring roles -- even of the animated kind. Thats all the more evident in comparison to Cumberbatch and Malkovich who invest their vocal contributions with colorful traits and rich inner lives that belie their all-too-limited screen time. (Animators apparently observed both actors individual work in the recording booth and borrowed gestures and movements from those physical performances for their toon counterparts.) Although the two thesps have experience with motion capture work (Cumberbatch in ""The Hobbit"" films and Malkovich in ""Beowulf"") ""Penguins"" reps the first traditionally animated feature for each. Judging by the much-needed added value they bring here it wont be the last. On the tech side the pic is a generally smooth ride with careful consideration given to making the many action sequences pop in 3D. But the graceful camerawork precise editing and high-quality animation still cant disguise the lack of imagination that went into the overall conception and the repetitive sameness that creeps into every bind the penguins find themselves in. Despite the varied locations -- Venice Shanghai and Kentuckys Fort Knox among them -- ""Penguins"" never has the feel of a thrilling globe-trotting caper. As long as ""Penguins"" entertains their kids frazzled parents arent likely to mind the lackluster effort. But in a year in which theyve already been exposed to ""The Lego Movie"" and ""Big Hero 6"" even the littlest moviegoers may very well call fowl on this one.
