"Johnny English Fool Britannia washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Johnny English Fool Britannia Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 18 2003 ""JOHNNY ENGLISH"" a spy spoof based on -- I kid you not -- a popular series of British credit card commercials featuring an inept secret agent is silly. Now theres just plain silly and then theres British silly. Directed by Peter ""Sliding Doors"" Howitt and starring the adorable bumbler Rowan Atkinson as the titular super-sleuth ""Johnny English"" is the latter variety which even at its stupidest (picture Atkinson in a James Bond-style white dinner jacket covered with human excrement) is still delivered with the kind of English aplomb that PBS audiences around the country have come to know and love. It must be the accent. When ""Johnny English"" opens our hero is seen infiltrating the lair of some criminal mastermind in the process overcoming a pair of vicious guard dogs with squeak toys single-handedly disarming a couple of automatic weapon-toting sentries and seducing the requisite femme fatale. Except that its all a dream. It turns out hes actually a low-level office-bound functionary for the British Secret Service and it isnt until a couple of dozen of his superiors are killed -- thanks to his incompetence mind you -- that Johnny is promoted to field operative. His first case? Foil the plans of fiendish French villain Pascal Sauvage (John Malkovich having an obvious ball with the worlds thickest accent) to have himself declared king of England -- dont ask -- and to turn the country into one large penal colony for the worlds criminals. Existing in a realm of quality somewhere above the level of ""The Master of Disguise"" but below that of the ""Austin Powers"" series ""Johnny English"" does manage to get off some good laughs especially during a scene in which Johnny accidentally injects himself with a powerful muscle relaxant. As any fan of the ""Mr. Bean"" and ""The Black Adder"" series knows Atkinson is a gifted physical comedian not to mention a master of the bemused expression. Make that several hundred bemused expressions. Atkinsons arsenal of wryly cocked eyebrow desperately furrowed forehead and cocky ""what me worry?"" smile subtly delineates emotions ranging from cluelessness-in-denial to suppressed panic. Sure the movies corny and rude. After all Johnnys partner played with exquisite deadpan by British comic Ben Miller is an agent named sniggeringly enough Bough. (In case you dont think thats funny remember its pronounced to rhyme with ""cough."") Lots of ""Beavis and Butthead""-style mileage is gotten out of just hearing Atkinson say that over and over. And when trying to impress the gorgeous agent Lorna Campbell (songstress Natalie Imbruglia) with his knowledge of Japanese Johnny somehow manages to offer a toast that is translated in subtitles as ""May all your daughters be born with three bottoms."" Okay so its sophomoric. You were expecting maybe ""Masterpiece Theatre""? ""Johnny English"" is innocuous if dumb fun which is great if youre looking for something to take your Anglophilic 7-year-old to that wont make you blush too terribly but not if youre looking for something with a few more teeth than ""The Pink Panther."" JOHNNY ENGLISH (PG 87 minutes) -- Contains mild bathroom humor slapstick a buttock or two and naughty slang. Area theaters.

Hes always raising an eyebrow in an attempt at Bond-like suaveness but it never quite works -- somewhere behind that glance is desperation just barely covered with bravado. Alas as the Brits would say Agent Number One of the British Secret Service is in constant cock-up. Best known for his work on the British television series ""Mr. Bean"" and ""Blackadder"" and for the movies ""The Tall Guy"" ""Rat Race"" and ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" (in which he played a hilariously speech-impaired pastor) the beak-nosed Atkinson is a marvelous comic presence and whenever he has something to react to ""Johnny English"" is a hoot. Pity though that he couldnt have come along before the various ""Austin Powers"" movies glutted our appetites for Bond spoofs; much of ""Johnny English"" feels like weve seen it before. Movie review View trailer  1/2 ""Johnny English"" with Rowan Atkinson Natalie Imbruglia Ben Miller John Malkovich. Directed by Peter Howitt from a screenplay by Neal Purvis Robert Wade and William Davies. 87 minutes. (Rated PG for comic nudity some crude humor and language. Several theaters. Nonetheless theres a very British authenticity to this movie; screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade wrote the last two James Bond movies (""The World Is Not Enough"" ""Die Another Day"") so they know of what they spoof. The plot revolves around the theft of the British crown jewels which may or may not be masterminded by French business magnate Pascal Sauvage (John Malkovich). Johnny English (whos become Agent Number One because well everybody else in the British Secret Service died in an unfortunate incident) is on the case with his sidekick Bough (Ben Miller) dashing about in natty suits and trying vainly to make his gun work properly. Thats the story but really ""Johnny English"" is a series of humiliations slapstick and otherwise for its title character whos all too aware that hes in over his head. And while you can see a number of the plot devices coming a kilometer away many of them are very funny. Johnny trying to impress a sultry fellow agent (singer Natalie Imbruglia costumed like a fourth Charlies Angel) gets his tie caught in a sushi-bar conveyer belt. Later he puts just the right defensive spin on the immortal line ""All right so I was wrong about the archbishops bottom."" Casting Malkovich as a villain is a bit spot-on but hes clearly having a ball with a swoosh of gray hair and a slinky French accent like hes speaking through a mouthful of Camembert. And Miller with his constant ""sir?"" makes a funny foil. ""Johnny English"" may well be too specifically British and too slight to connect strongly with audiences but its a pleasant enough diversion. And when Atkinson desperately trying to emulate his suave predecessor tries to smoothly toss his coat onto its peg only to see it sail out the window -- well in a comedy-starved season his bug-eyed reaction is like ice cream in July.

Starring Rowan Atkinson Natalie Imbruglia and Ben Miller. Directed by Peter Howitt. Written by Neal Purvis Robert Wade and William Davies. (PG. 87 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Rowan Atkinson the British star of ""Johnny English"" is one of the comic treasures of our times but he has such a specific talent -- physical comedy thats subtle and brainy -- that hes hard to cast. In the delicious ""Mr. Bean"" series playing an accident-prone klutz who suffers a nonstop volley of lifes humiliations he found a perfect vessel. By playing the boob so brilliantly Atkinson allows us the catharsis of recognizing our own incompetencies and lack of poise. Puncturing pomposity he exploits that thin line separating cool veneer from hidden doubts and silent- screen great Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin makes us feel less alone by revealing his own inner schlemiel. In ""Johnny English"" Atkinson shapes a character thats just as compatible with his skills as Mr. Bean but one whose goosey buffoonery plays out on a much larger much more absurd canvas. Based on a character he played in several British credit card commercials from 1992 to 1997 Johnny is a hapless desk jockey who toils in the bowels of British intelligence headquarters. A dreamer and geek Johnny steps into the breach when British Secret Service loses all its best agents at a funeral bombing. Disguising his hopelessness with false bravado Johnny lifts up his chin dons the tuxedo and sets out to recover the Crown Jewels that were stolen from the Tower of London. The fiend behind the bombing and jewel theft is Pascal Sauvage a flouncy megalomaniacal Frenchman who wants nothing less than to conquer England and turn the sceptered isle into a mass prison a dumping ground for ""human waste. "" John Malkovich has a ball with the part skewering his own screen-villain persona and delivering an absurdly overripe French accent. Desperate to be cool and masterful Johnny galumphs into everything. Picking up an ink pen he accidentally shoots a secretary. Dining at a sushi bar he gets his necktie caught in the oval conveyor belt. Trying to outfox Sauvage he barges into the wrong building -- a hospital -- and thinks hes uncovered a sinister lab for human experimentation. Once he realizes his blunder Johnny eyes the frightened nurses and surgeons hes gathered at gunpoint clears his throat and justifies himself ""This has been a test of your emergency response system."" Whats beautiful in Atkinsons performance aside from that wonderfully pliant funny and expressive body is the way he reveals Johnnys mental process. ""Bugger got that one wrong"" he seems to be thinking eyes bulging slightly shifting side to side. ""If I dont let on no one will be the wiser."" The spy-spoof genre is old hat -- hell even the 007 films are exercises in self-mockery at this point -- but Atkinson is such an inventive endearing clown that one doesnt mind. Whats more ""Johnny English"" was co-written by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade collaborators on ""Die Another Day"" and ""The World Is Not Enough"" and they know their cocktails curvy babes and sophisticated gadgetry inside out. Ben Miller co-stars as Johnnys right-hand man Bough (pronounced ""Boff"") and perfectly calibrates his performance to the absurdist tone established by Atkinson and director Peter Howitt (""Sliding Doors""). Australian pop singer Natalie Imbruglia plays luscious kick-boxing Lorna Campbell this movies ""Bond girl"" and acquits herself adequately in her first major screen role. This movie contains slight nudity and raunchy humor.

Too bad Johnny English isnt more befitting his significant talents. The jokes often are corny or labored and the story is predictable. However Atkinson raises the movie to the level of good fun by the force of his outrageous persona and skill at physical comedy. His eye-rolling smirking and pompous posturing will remind audiences of his silly childlike and anarchic character Mr. Bean but Johnny English is actually a good deal brighter. And unlike Bean he speaks. Review of the movie Johnny English ( out of four) Stars Rowan Atkinson John Malkovich Natalie Imbruglia Ben Miller Director Peter Howitt Distributor Universal Pictures Rating PG-13 for comic nudity some crude humor and language. Opens Friday nationwide As Johnny English Atkinson plays a desk-bound employee of the British Secret Service who is thrust onto the front lines after an explosion kills all the other working agents. (They had gathered for a funeral of one of their own.) English cant believe his new work tools are fast cars with ejector seats and high-tech intelligence devices. So of course he misuses and abuses them. Denial is his rationale of choice. Hes convinced hes a world-class spy and his constant screw-ups cant convince him otherwise. English is put on the case of guarding the crown jewels but theyre stolen from under his nose. Assigned to retrieve them he tangles with a dashing but evil Frenchman (John Malkovich in a very unfunny turn) and flirts with a mysterious double agent (pop singer Natalie Imbruglia). Johnnys mistakes and bumbling mishaps can be funny but they are overworked such as his repeated use of a broken gun. Most kids will find the bathroom humor hilarious though it may be too graphic to sit well with their parents. The origins for English lie in a TV commercial Atkinson played an accident-prone spy for a British credit card company in the early 90s and the idea for a feature film evolved from there. The finished product is a bit like Austin Powers for the under-10 audience a reasonably entertaining spy spoof that qualifies as good-natured family amusement.

Mr. Bean goes 007 in ""Johnny English"" an extremely silly but effective enough romp for family auds showcasing Brit comic Rowan Atkinsons trademarked brand of arrogant dumbness. Theres nothing exactly new here for older auds -- Bond spoofs have been around for almost as long as the character himself -- and the script lacks the normal polish of Working Titles productions but the presence of Aussie thrush Natalie Imbruglia in her first bigscreen role reps a draw for younger viewers. Released throughout most of Europe (plus Oz) in the second week of April pic looks set for jovial business especially on home turf with Stateside release skedded for July 18. Script originally by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade who worked on the past two Bond opuses gets straight down to business with a pre-credits sequence that tangentially recalls ""From Russia With Love."" In reality Johnny English (Atkinson) turns out to be a lowly desk-based member of ""MI7"" but when the departments prize operative Agent One is killed in Biarritz and all the other agents are blown up at his funeral Englishs boss Pegasus (Tim Pigott-Smith) upgrades the klutzy spook. Enter Gallic entrepreneur Pascal Sauvage (John Malkovich with an accent as thick as camembert cheese) who owns a PS7 billion (10 billion) business empire founded on commercially run prisons. Anglophile Sauvage is sponsoring an exhibition of the Crown Jewels and when the royal baubles disappear right under Englishs nose on opening night the MI7 op sets out to nail the ""flouncy Frenchman."" Like the pics title itself which plays on the pejorative Brit term ""Johnny Foreigner"" English is an old-style comic xenophobe. (In a line that gains unexpected resonance from contemporary events English sneers that ""the only thing the French should be allowed to host is an invasion."") But the jibes are good-humored enough with the bumbling Brits coming off worse throughout the movie. Following an underground tunnel that was the thieves escape route English and his long-suffering sidekick Bough (Ben Miller) chase a hearse in which the jewels are stashed. First real action sequence involving some passingly clever work with Englishs car stuck on a hoist sets the generally low-tech level of the film which remains more reliant on character comedy than flashy f/x. Pegasus still refuses to believe that the respected Sauvage is the villain but English blunders on in his simple-minded conviction later joined by the mysterious Lorna (Imbruglia) who keeps cropping up in the wrong places. Film as a whole starts to develop a real comic rhythm -- as opposed to being simply a series of set pieces -- at the hour mark with a temporary shift of location to the south of France and a loony off-the-scale finale in Westminster Abbey as Sauvage seeks to become King of England. Unlike other spy spoofs especially ""Austin Powers"" film doesnt rely on referencing Bond movies or coming up with witty one-liners. Comedy is more character than genre-based and in true Bean-ish style comes from the audience always being one step ahead of the main protag. The comic pay-off thus becomes at what point the disdainful English will throw away the spade and slide out of his embarrassment -- a routine Atkinson has already honed to perfection. (Character is based on one he created for a series of commercials for U.K. credit card company Barclaycard.) Rest of the cast is OK though Imbruglia doesnt have much more to do than look beautiful and Malkovich isnt as funny as he should be. Miller however is fine as Atkinsons cartoony straight man. Casting of Kevin McNally as the U.K. prime minister seems designed as an in-joke for British auds as the thesp bears some resemblance to Gordon Brown Tony Blairs ambitious deputy. Helmer Peter Howitt (""Sliding Doors"" ""AntiTrust"") directs without any special signature or gloss. Technical credits are pro with editor Robin Sales bringing the film in at an ultra-tight 86 minutes including credits. Edward Shearmurs score incorporates several Bondish nods and Remi Adefarasins lensing gets the job done.
