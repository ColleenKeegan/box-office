In this era of women power the old Cinderella fantasys continuing strength may have something to do with so many big-screen iterations of princess stories that inundate current entertainment. Its hard to say if anyone really wants to see what happens after a heartwarming story about a regular girl morphing into royalty but Walt Disney Pictures takes its chance on ""The Princess Diaries 2 Royal Engagement."" And why wouldnt they considering people are more than willing to watch poorly produced reality television shows that house women in huge abodes looking for their Prince Charming? Nicholas (Chris Pine) proves an unlikely suitor for Princess Mia (Anne Hathaway) in ""The Princess Diaries 2 Royal Engagement."" (Ron Batzdorff -- Buena Vista Pictures) _____More in Movies_____  Princess Diaries 2 Showtimes and Details  Watch the Trailer  Summer Movie Guide  Arts amp; Living Movies _____Free E-mail Newsletters_____  News Headlines  News Alert Luckily ""Princess Diaries 2"" doesnt promote the stereotype still prevalent in popular culture that a princess (read woman) is weak or somehow broken without a male counterpart. Though it banks its plot on the quest of its main character Mia (Anne Hathaway) to find a man within 30 days or risk giving up her throne the film focuses on Mias reluctance to do so and her grandmothers challenging of an old law that states princesses must be married before becoming queen. Queen Clarisse (Julie Andrews) herself is a strong single and beloved leader. Since the last installment when Mia learned she was the princess of the small European country Genovia she graduated from college in the United States and heads back to Europe to take more princess lessons from her grandmother before assuming the throne. But soon after she moves in to the royal palace Mia learns that another heir to the throne exists and the ideological 21-year-old American who cannot imagine partaking in an arranged marriage decides to sacrifice finding real love to keep her familys royal lineage going. She quickly finds a suitor who meets all the requirements though he isnt the right fit and gets engaged. Meanwhile in one of many neatly contrived plot elements the enemy heir to the throne comes to the royal castle for an extended visit and just happens to be a handsome guy who pushes her buttons and forces her to doubt her ability to settle for a husband she does not love. As the fight for the throne plays out a lot of slapstick humor and unlikely silliness invade the castle. At one point princesses from all over the world and Queen Clarisse are sliding down staircases on mattresses. Not that the queen in command of a country wouldnt be a master mattress-surfer but chances are the Cinderella fantasy remains just that even in the sequel. Nobody would really want to be princess if she thought she would have to stop having pillow fights (read constant fun) or if there werent an abundance of hot guys vying for her affection. Sometimes charming sometimes a tad too silly and all the time predictable ""Princess Diaries 2"" gives you what youd expect and doesnt take many chances besides allowing for the possibility that a princess might be okay without a husband.

What does he know? Hes not a princess. For heres the secret that both ""Princess Diaries"" and this sequel understand and that fatso couldnt figure out in a million years All of us girls are princesses. Our daddies told us so and these two movies merely validate that which we know to be true. The fat guy with his stuff about how charmless it was how slow and how long? Well he doesnt know a thing. He doesnt speak princess. He speaks fat old man. Julie Andrews left and Anne Hathaway are back for more royal high jinks in ""Princess Diaries 2 The Royal Engagement."" (Ron Batzdorff - Buena Vista Pictures) _____More in Movies_____  Princess Diaries 2 Showtimes and Details  Watch the Trailer  Summer Movie Guide  Arts amp; Living Movies _____Free E-mail Newsletters_____  News Headlines  News Alert To be sure ""2"" doesnt have quite the mythic splendor of the original. In that one derived from the deservedly successful novel by Meg Cabot a young American teenager played by Anne Hathaway discovered that she was the rightful heir to the throne of Genovia a landlocked tiny kingdom in Disney World -- no no in Europe silly. She had to struggle with her princesshood helped by her magisterial grandmother Mary Poppins. Oh thats ""princess humor"" It was Julie Andrews the queen. And who could make a better queen than Miss Andrews? I think nobody The movie was brisk and smart and all the performances were winning. So now theyve made No. 2 and Mr. Smarty-pants tells you theres not enough story in it to fill a shoebox and that the business where the princess keeps tripping and falling or dropping things has gotten thin particularly since three years have passed and Hathaway as Princess Mia Thermopolis is no longer gangly and gawky but a beautifully poised and polished young woman. He didnt laugh once during the whole movie but we princesses were in princess heaven. Who are you going to believe him or a whole theater of princesses? And he seems to suggest if I understand him right that the director Mr. Garry Marshall has lost his zip. He believes the movie suffers from a definite zip shortage. Where has all the zip gone? he wails. Well let me tell you any movie that features Miss Julie Andrews mattress-surfing down a royal staircase while singing disco has got zip left over Its got her onstage with a super-talented princess who is hip-hop dancing and Miss Andrews isnt missing a beat As for Hathaway she is regal human and has a smile that makes others seem like advertisements for tooth decay Where others hath a way Anne hath a smile that would melt a vault door and even the hearts of all save the most jaded twisted self-infatuated experts on like nothing I did hear some missed cute Robert Schwartzman who ended up as Princess Mias boyfriend at the end of the first movie and that the substitution of hairdo model Chris Pine wasnt much help. Someone -- it may have been that fat guy -- even said that Pine has the charisma of a terra-cotta Chia Pet doing a Robert Wagner impression. And the plot extremely mild about palace intrigue in princess procedure that requires Mia to hook up with a prince or near-prince in 30 days? Oh all right maybe its a little weak to sustain a movie thats two hours long -- yes two hours. Please it takes two hours to tell a princesss story. You cant shortchange a princess. In all the movie is for all of those who are princesses and all of those who are lucky enough to be the parents of one married to one or hanging out with one. So if your princess tells you to see the movie shut up and get the car. And pay no attention to the fat guy. Princess Diaries 2 The Royal Engagement (115 minutes at area theaters) is rated G.

Even so Disney stands a reasonably good chance of generating respectable late-summer B.O. given the surprisingly strong performance of 2001s ""The Princess Diaries."" Aimed at femme grade schoolers young teens and indulgent grandmothers ""The Princess Diaries 2 Royal Engagement"" is too blandly insubstantial to expand its appeal beyond its target demographic. Even so Disney stands a reasonably good chance of generating respectable late-summer B.O. given the surprisingly strong performance of 2001s ""The Princess Diaries"" a modern-day fairy tale about a gawky San Francisco teen (Anne Hathaway) who discovers shes the granddaughter of a European queen (Julie Andrews). Unimaginatively contrived and slackly paced sequel likely wont match 108 million domestic gross of sleeper-hit predecessor but could enjoy equally impressive afterlife as homevid product. With vet helmer Garry Marshall again in the directors chair and most major players reprising their roles new pic begins five years after events of 2001 pic. Mia Thermopolis (Hathaway) newly graduated from Princeton with a political science degree flies off to the tiny principality of Genovia to live with Queen Clarisse (Andrews) and presumably assume her duties as princess. Shortly after she arrives at the palace however Mia learns that the succession process has accelerated and that she is expected to take the crown herself in the wake of her grandmothers early retirement. Unfortunately theres a catch Ancient Genovian laws dictate that no unmarried woman may assume the countrys throne. Worse the crafty Viscount Mabrey (John Rhys-Davies) hopes to exploit this technicality by installing his handsome young nephew Nicholas Devereaux (Chris Pine) as rightful heir to the crown. Mia has just 30 days to find a suitable husband -- and while shes at it complete a crash course in queenly decorum -- if she wants to follow her grandmother as ruler of Genovia a mythical realm where inhabitants speak with a rather distracting variety of American British and European accents. (Pic was shot entirely in Southern California.) Working from a flavorless script by Shonda Rhimes Marshall strives to manufacture low-voltage tension by forcing Mia to choose between two possible Mr. Rights Andrew Jacoby (Callum Blue) an affable Brit nobleman whos more of a polite companion than an ardent suitor; and Nicholas a hunky charmer who progresses from sneaky deception to genuine adoration as he continues to pursue Mia even after her announced engagement to Andrew. Mindful of target audiences expectations filmmakers are a tad too eager to stick with the formula that fueled previous pic. Despite her Princeton degree and fab-glam makeover Mia comes across as scarcely more sophisticated than she was as a dorky teen in first pic. (Instead of a bridal shower she hosts a slumber party with a toddlers-to-teens guest list.) Indeed frequent scenes featuring wan slapstick suggest Mia actually has gotten even klutzier after turning 21. Hathaway once again demonstrates engaging charisma and a flair for physical comedy but shes hamstrung by the script whenever she tries to indicate Mia truly is evolving into adulthood. As Queen Clarisse Andrews once again radiates class compassion and worldly wisdom with effortless elan. Better still she has a few unexpectedly affecting scenes with longtime bodyguard Joe (Hector Elizondo another alumnus of previous pic). Among other returnees from first ""Princess Diaries"" Heather Matarazzo makes most vivid impression (with too few scenes alas) as Lily Mias best friend since childhood. Pine suggests a younger smarmier Rob Lowe as Nicholas. For some inexplicable reason -- bad lighting? excessive makeup? -- Rhys-Davies spends most of pic looking like a waxworks figure. Still he is suitably animated when it comes to snarling villainy. Other supporting performances range from unremarkable (Tom Poston as a Genovian parliament minister) to acutely grating (Kim Thomson as an aggressively chipper TV reporter). Marvel Comics legend Stan Lee has a fleeting cameo as a wedding guest whos much too fond of the Three Stooges. Production credits are at best serviceable with some scenes noteworthy for conspicuously unattractive lensing. Soundtrack abounds in peppy pop tunes by the likes of Pink Avril Lavigne Raven (who co-stars and briefly duets with Andrews) and Wilson Phillips. Norah Jones provides a dreamy cover of ""Love Me Tender"" that Marshall effectively uses to compliment a slow dance in the moonlight. Marshall also peppers pic with sly allusions to TV sitcoms that employed him as writer producer and/or director in the 1960s and 70s. Listen closely and youll hear references to everything from Lucy Carmichael (Lucille Balls character on ""The Lucy Show"") to Lenny and Squiggy (from ""Laverne amp; Shirley""). In a similar vein helmer gives Andrews an in-jokey opportunity to recall ""Mary Poppins"" when she remarks ""Ive done a lot of flying in my time.""

Anne Hathaways performance is one of the bright spots in Princess Diaries 2. Disney Lacking the charm and sparkle of its predecessor The Royal Engagement seeks to plump up its thin plot with sentimentality trotting out many of the original cast members in an attempt to remind audiences of what they liked in the first place. (Related video Watch a clip from Princess Diaries 2) Anne Hathaway reprises her role as the plucky likable Mia Thermopolis now a college graduate making preparations to assume the throne of picturesque Genovia (a fictional European country with Italian influences). Though she is older wiser and more sophisticated Mia is still refreshingly unspoiled enraptured by her new life. Her castle is sumptuous. Drawers full of crown jewels make those in the Tower of London look like cheap trinkets. One of the countrys laws does add a furrow to Mias brow To become queen she must be married. Still she feels strongly enough about helping the people of Genovia to agree to an arranged marriage. Or so it seems. One must take her newfound commitment to humanitarian causes on faith because the last time we saw her she was 16 and understandably more interested in her first car and winning over her high school crush. Hathaway is as charming as she was in the first film though she is not given the opportunity to exercise as much of her comedic talent. And Andrews as the ready-to-retire Queen Clarisse does a fine job her natural grace and regal qualities again serving the role well. Mias best friend (Heather Matarazzo) and mother (Caroline Goodall) also reappear. New to the cast is Chris Pine playing a heartthrob and possibly duplicitous pretender to the throne. For the under-12 set is a royal slumber party with princesses from all over the world including Disney Channel star Raven who joins Andrews in the duet. The party includes mattress surfing in a palatial setting with even Andrews hanging 10 down an elegant ramp. Montages include additional sessions of ""princess training"" one featuring an archery lesson and a tired gag of misfired arrows as well as several other cliched and slapstick scenes. The first films formula remains intact which may make some fans happy. If all you want is gowns tiaras a clumsy heroine and forced hilarity your needs will be met. But those hoping to see the engaging characters in interesting new adventures will be disappointed. We all love a good fairy tale but the enchantment is missing in this predictable sequel.

Directed by Garry Marshall. Written by Shonda Rhimes and Gina Wendkos based on characters created by Meg Cabot. (Rated G. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters). ""The Princess Diaries 2 Royal Engagement"" celebrates the maturation of a young star and the enduring charm of a mature icon. Sure to captivate fans of Anne Hathaway and Julie Andrews this sequel from populist director Garry Marshall maker of ""Pretty Woman"" and the first ""Princess Diaries"" offers enough glossy good cheer to appeal to everyone. Or at least everyone female and lacking in cynicism. Princess Mia (Hathaway) the gawky San Francisco girl who discovered she was royalty in the first ""Princess Diaries"" has graduated college and headed for Genovia a Monaco-like kingdom ruled by her grandmother (Andrews). The gilded tasteful castle and surroundings are inhabited by well-scrubbed aristocrats and commoners who appear to be one part French and several parts Hollywood back lot. The reunion of Mia and her grandmother allows Hathaway and Andrews to resume their affectionate banter from ""Princess Diaries."" The queen remains loving but firm in instructing her granddaughter in royal behavior. The lessons are advanced because Mia is to become queen after her impending 21st birthday. Now a lovely self-assured young woman the princess is far removed from her frizzy-haired awkwardness at the start of the first picture. With the Pygmalion aspects played out Marshall and writers Shonda Rhimes and Gina Wendkos have introduced new challenges. Powdered-wig fuddy-duddies in Genovias parliament wary of this foreign young woman invoke a rule requiring a queen to wed before taking the throne. This leads to a search for a suitable match. Prince William to Mias regret isnt eligible because he already has a kingdom. She quickly accepts the proposal of lesser British royal played with gallantry by Callum Blue (the hedonist reaper from Showtimes ""Dead Like Me""). The speed of Mias cooperation with the marriage idea will send a mixed but intriguing message to little girls in the audience. She agrees to the arrangement out of fierce desire to lead a kingdom ruled by her ancestors for centuries. Hathaway plays these scenes well displaying an ambition that doesnt suit a fairy-tale heroine but fits a confident American girl. That same confidence presents a problem when Marshall tries to revive Mias former klutziness for laughs. Apart from a setup that allows Andrews to deliver the killer line ""A princess never chases a chicken"" these slapstick elements seem forced. Hathaway is simply too sleek. Shes better at fiery defiance as when Mia stomps the foot of a young Genovian royal (Chris Pine) who is wooing her as he schemes to steal the crown with his Machiavellian uncle. John Rhys-Davies from ""The Lord of the Rings"" plays the uncle and he would have twirled his mustache were it not anchored to a beard. A Disney fantasy like this one isnt about to let an actor as handsome as Pine play a complete creep. Sparks soon fly between Mia and the Genovian despite her engagement. The movies other romantic quandary involves the queen and her head of security played by the reliably soothing Hector Elizondo. He wants to legalize their clandestine romance after she abdicates the throne. Andrews and Elizondo though lacking much romantic chemistry are such pros that they render this later-life relationship believable down to the queens instinct to keep this devoted man the holder of her heart at arms length. The best moments of ""Royal Engagement"" either explore the glamour of palace life or puncture its pomp. The queen introduces Mia to the young womans enormous fully outfitted closet the stuff of girls dreams. A remote control opens doors and drawers to reveal designer goodies as well as the arrival of Mias straight-talking best pal (Heather Matarazzo) on leave from ""Berserkeley"" to ground her friend in American reality. The palace staff is good for several laughs. Sophie Comet and Shea Curry bring a sense of play to a pair of maids with a balletic compulsion to curtsy. An indiscreet young security officer (Erik Bragg) shouts the comings and goings of the queen (""The eagle has left""). Marshall includes in-jokes older television fans will recognize but kids will not. A line about nepotisms role in the arts is a nod to Marshalls tendency to hire his relatives including sister Penny for his TV show ""Laverne and Shirley."" The maids are later called ""Lenny and Squiggy"" Other allusions play on Andrews career such as the queens announcement that she always has liked to fly. But reminders of Andrews singular elegance arent necessary when it is still so much in evidence. A sequence in which Mia hosts fellow princesses for a bachelorette- slumber party is designed to showcase Andrews who sings a duet with TV star Raven Simone. Her well-reported vocal problems have left Andrews hoarse but her voice augmented by a commanding screen presence works well enough to provide the movies most transcendent moment.

That said this unworthy serf humbly and non-Marxistly wonders what it offers todays youngsters. In the first ""Princess Diaries"" awkward San Francisco teen Mia Thermopolis (radiant regular-gal Anne Hathaway) discovered she was heir to the throne of Genovia a fictitious European land-of-many-accents. We didnt see much of Genovia itself only its queen Clarisse (Julie Andrews) in Frisco playing fairy godmother to Mia. This allowed director Garry Marshall to tease gentle G-rated laughs out of the guiltiest American fantasy - royalty - without negotiating the details of modern princessery. (Recall he avoided the messier details of another guilty American fantasy in ""Pretty Woman."") Not so this time. In Princess Diaries 2 A Royal Engagement Mia having graduated Princeton in poli sci is now off to rule Euro Disney er Genovia. But not only must she win her peoples hearts (by displaying empathy for yes orphans) she must also marry according to an antiquated law. ""So unfair"" she frets echoing the frustrations of many young girls who...what? Have their own theme-park nations to play with? The films generic feminism pales beside its bloated sense of privilege only underlined by a nonstop cabaret of sideshow acts. Speaking of which Who decided to drop a beat behind Andrews corny-but-touching vocal number?
